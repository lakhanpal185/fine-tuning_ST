Discussion Title: Can the Earth be Under 10,000 Years Old?

1. The earth cannot be under 10,000 years old.
1.1. Pro: [Continental motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent_cycle) must be older than 10,000 years.
1.2. Pro: Geology cannot be explained without vast time.
1.2.1. Pro: A single strata layer can take 10,000 or more years to form. We have thousands upon thousands of layers alone on the crust of the planet. 10,000 years would not be enough to time to form all of these layers or possibly even one.
1.2.1.1. Con: Any event that durates longer than 10,000 years wouldn't be an attractive counter to a Young-Earth Worldview.  How would we know if a layer takes more than 10,000 years to form if within the timescale of a young earth we wouldn't have time for even one layer to form.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Just because we haven't been around long enough to watch an entire event happen doesn't mean that we cannot measure the RATE of an event and extrapolate a time period for it. We do this every day when we travel.  In 1 hour we travel 60 miles. When will we arrive at our destination 600 miles away etc? Establishing rates over time is very normal and using them to predict events is done through every field of activity from sports to medicine, engineering to geology etc.
1.2.2. Pro: Observation of the local geology should show anyone that what they see must be much older than 10,000 years. Mountains, dry lakes, eroded limestone formations at 3000 feet above sea level, for example.
1.2.2.1. Pro: This fact does not negate the account of creation in Genesis 1-2. 1\) "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." No time frame is given. 2\) The 6 days are eras or epochs, not 24 hour days. See [chapter 3](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101985013).
1.3. Pro: [Dendrochronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology) \(the study of tree rings\) alone goes back over 12,000 years.
1.3.1. Pro: We also have history in the form of fossils going back billions of years.
1.3.2. Con: Dendrochronology is a man made system. Men make mistakes. It may not be accurate.
1.4. Con: The earth can be all sorts of ages depending on the clock that is used. If we measure from now on the earth back to the big bang then the universe is around 15.6 billions years old. If we measure from the big bang until now then the universe is 6 days old. Here is a link explaining special relativity: [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AInCqm5nCzw) here is a link to how this works in the case of the earth and a 6 day creation by a man with his PHD in Physics from MIT: [geraldschroeder.com](http://geraldschroeder.com/wordpress/?page_id=53)  \(Math included\)
1.4.1. Con: This is a classic example of cognitive misdirection- the 'clock' used doesn't change because of general relativity.
1.4.1.1. Con: Yes, General Relativity can and does change the speed of clocks all the time. [www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html)
1.5. Pro: Astronomy and physics are not consistent with Young Earth Creationism.
1.6. Con: The Bible - and similar religious texts - date the earth as under 10,000 years old.
1.6.1. Con: There is no reason to consider the Bible as credible. It has many demonstrably false claims, as well as internal inconsistencies.
1.6.2. Con: Translation causes meaning to get corrupted. 10,000 years may not be accurate to the original claims
1.6.2.1. Con: Scholars and Translators have access to close to the original texts.
1.6.2.2. Con: We have the dead sea scrolls as definitive proof that the texts passed down where amazingly accurate. The claim that stuff changed as it was passed down is debunked. [probe.org](https://probe.org/the-dead-sea-scrolls/)
1.6.3. Con: The Bible makes no claim that the earth is less than 10,000 years. Its an interpretation of Genesis and the 6 creative days. A creative day is an undefined measurement. It could be a literal day or a 1000 years like Peter 3:8 states "With the Lord a day is like a thousand years" and since Peter says "like" a "creative day" may even be a much longer span of time as in millions of years.
1.6.4. Con: 1\) The Bible never, at any point, makes any claim regarding Earth's age. 2\) Even if it did, a book is not a valid dating technique. Books can say whatever the author wants them to say, including both true and false statements. What matters is what can be demonstrated by the physical evidence.
1.6.4.1. Con: Genesis makes quite clear in the first few chapters that the universe is 6 days old \(as measured by God or the Cosmic background radiation clock if you prefer\) plus around 6,000 years which is computed by adding up the generations listed in Genesis plus the time that has passed after that till now.
1.6.5. Con: Using religious texts as indicators for understanding the age of the earth is appeal to authority, therefore a logical fallacy. The Scientific method is a rigorous, thoroughly testable approach to discovering facts about the age of the earth and the consensus amongst a majority of geologists and scientists is  the earth is billions of years old, therefore the earth can't be under 10,000 years old.
1.6.6. Con: The Old Testament is a spiritual book that makes no claims to teach science or metaphysics. That it includes two conflicting versions of Genesis is further evidence not to take the creation story as literal fact.
1.7. Con: The earth could have been created “mature” with the appearance of age.
1.7.1. Con: No God of Truth would build a fake history that never happened to deceive people looking for truth.
1.7.2. Con: This suggestion is unfalsifiable, meaning that there is no possible evidence that could prove it wrong. Unfalsifiable hypotheses are not allowed in science, because they cannot be disproven and have no predictive or explanatory power.
1.7.3. Pro: From a purely theoretical standpoint it's possible the earth was created in a mature/developed state, not only less than 10,000 years ago but as recently the [beginning of the reader's life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_solipsism) or even [last Thursday](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Last_Thursdayism), with our thoughts and memories pre-loaded into us. Not to say this would be good science or affirm the religious notions that typically underpin the claim earth is less than 10,000 years old, but it stands as an extremely far-out possibility.
1.7.4. Con: If the earth is young it would not appear to be old. Many scientific experiments have analyzed resources and facts given to us to dismiss the theory of the earth being less aged that it seems. The claim that the earth has been created mature with the appearance of age is a figment of imagination.
1.7.5. Con: There is no difference between something that is created old and something that got old. From an internal perspective it is the same.
1.7.6. Con: Mature is one thing; complete, with a false history that never happened, is another. The former is reasonable, the latter is fraud and deception.
1.8. Pro: [Radiometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating) and [carbon dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating) show the earth is [ancient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) \(~4.5 billion years\).
1.8.1. Con: The accuracy of radiometric and carbon dating is overstated.   There is [negligible accuracy](http://www5.csudh.edu/oliver/smt310-handouts/dating/dating.htm) beyond 60,000 years.
1.8.1.1. Con: This still comfortably rules out the earth being under 10,000 years old.
1.8.1.2. Con: This confuses radiometric and carbon dating. Carbon dating has a limit of around 50,000 years due to the half life of carbon, but different elements have different half lives. When carbon dating is used on something older than 50,000 years, eg millions of years, it will max out and give dates of around 50,000. Dating with uranium or strontium has accuracies that work in billions of years. The error here is in not understanding which element to use for which timescale/circumstance.
1.8.1.3. Con: There are numerous types of radiometric dating which can be used depending, on the substance being measured. Radicarbon dating measures the accumulation \(caused by half-life decay\) of an isotope with a relatively short half-life, but there are numerous other methods of radiometric dating that can date elements with significantly longer half-lives, Uranium/Thorium \(32,000\), Al/Mg \(720k\), Iodine/Xenon \(16my\) and Uranium/Lead \(4.5bn\) to name a select few.
1.8.2. Pro: Just to clarify, carbon dating can't be used to date Earth because it applies only to carbon rich material and is only good to ages of 50-60 thousand years. However, radiometric dating in general shows that Earth contains rocks at least 3.5 billion years in age, and meteorites \(and Mars and the Moon\), which would have formed at the same time as Earth, all date to 4.5 billion years. The consistency and accuracy of these methods is astounding, and most definitely NOT overstated.
1.8.3. Pro: [Uranium-lead dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93lead_dating) is a form of radiometric dating which was used to determine the age of the earth. The rate of decay in the uranium of the earth is inconsistent with the earth being merely 10,000 years old. The actual age should be a little over 4 billion years.
1.9. Con: Massive catastrophes, such as Noah’s flood, can explain geology in much less time.
1.9.1. Con: There is no specific evidence to any of the biblical catastrophes. There is evidence for many catastrophes pre-dating 10,000 years ago.
1.9.2. Con: The multiple layers of sedimentary strata we observe are, by the laws of hydrodynamics, literally impossible to create in a single flood event. Floods don't produce layers like most of the ones we find in the geologic record. An immense amount of time is required to produce layers with such different grain size, sorting, and chemical composition.
1.9.2.1. Con: The presence of polystrate fossils suggests layers formed rapidly, and in catastrophic conditions.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: No they don't, there is a recognised explanation for them as far back as they have been known [Polystrate fossils](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Polystrate_fossils)
1.9.3. Con: If there had been a worldwide flood there would be a worldwide flood deposit. Instead there are just local flood deposits. This is in accord with what we see today - there are, occasionally, floods in places. That is what the evidence indicates in the past as well. If you look at the majority of geological sequences they are not flood deposits. So we know what flood deposit looks like, and most places are not those, disproving a global flood.
