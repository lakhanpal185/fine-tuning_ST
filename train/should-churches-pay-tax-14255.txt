Discussion Title: Should churches pay tax?

1. Churches should lose their automatic tax-exempt status.
1.1. Con: Religious organizations do important charitable work.
1.1.1. Pro: Churches provide [benefits](https://www.raptim.org/35-faith-based-organizations-dedicated-helping-people/) and [charitable work](https://www.theologydegrees.org/best-christian-charities/) that otherwise would be the job of the government to provide. Therefore, it would be unfair for the government to tax them.
1.1.1.1. Con: Churches who spend large sums on healthcare or other charitable projects can classify those expenses as such, making those costs tax-exempt. It's called a write-off and major corporations do this all the time.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Not all charitable work involves financial expenses. It can be a matter of time, energy and volunteering. Such churches that mainly benefit society through untaxable resources would be disadvantaged compared to those that do spend money.
1.1.2. Pro: Churches exist to teach, serve and help. Pastors need salaries, missionary and benevolent funds need cash and bills for power, heat, phone, internet, mortgage etc. need to be paid.
1.1.3. Con: The fact that an organisation does some good work does not imply that it ought to be tax exempt. Many corporations provide substantial charitable donations. However, the state would never give them tax-exempt status.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The entire religious organisation is not a charity. Basing tax-exempt status on the fact that charity occurs within churches is comparable to granting Hollywood A-listers tax-free status due to their well-known charity work and donations. Churches should be granted tax-free status only for the specific arm of the church that conducts charity work, not for the organisation as a whole.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Churches should not be given tax exemption. If a church wishes to use its income for charity, the money used for that charity can be exempted, the same way it works for individuals.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Churches should be taxed on their income. Then they should be able to deduct all of their charitable giving/activities such as food banks, soup kitchens, homeless assistance, as long as they do the charity work without discriminating.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: With non-religious taxes, the filer must list charitable claims. Religious organizations could do the same.  Much in the way non-profits do.
1.1.3.1.1.3. Con: It is difficult to define what constitutes charitable giving for any organization, including non-profit organizations, who often spend sizable portions of donations on advertising, managerial staff, etc. These expenses help generate new donations.
1.1.3.1.1.4. Con: The benefit of religious organizations has been evident for centuries in most cases. Their care for the poor, their benefits for society in their various efforts has been known and recognized. The fact non-secular organizations have to prove such is simply evident that their efforts are far narrower [in comparison](https://www.innovations.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/11120.pdf).
1.1.3.1.1.4.1. Con: The Red Cross helps the poor and the displaced, but they do not promote any intolerance, spread dogmatic beliefs, start wars, or punish heretics.
1.1.3.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Claiming religions promote intolerance, spread dogmatic beliefs, start wars or punish heretics is a gross generalisation.
1.1.3.1.1.4.1.2. Con: Non-religious non-profits may also promote intolerance and spread [dogmatic beliefs](https://nypost.com/2016/12/22/white-nationalist-groups-register-as-charities-and-raise-millions/). This is not specific to religious organizations.
1.1.3.1.1.4.2. Con: Religion may have some benefits, but it is dishonest to pretend that its impact is entirely positive.
1.1.3.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: The statement that religion is a social benefit is arguable. Religion has harmed many people in our community, [particularly First Nations](http://pluralism.org/encounter/historical-perspectives/first-encounters-native-americans-and-christians/).
1.1.3.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: The US Catholic Church has spent [millions](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/catholic-church-fights-clergy-child-sex-abuse-measures) lobbying officials in order to fight clergy sex abuse accountability.
1.1.3.1.1.4.2.3. Pro: The Catholic Church has had a history of [rotating priests](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11954518) in order to hide sexual abusers.
1.1.3.1.1.4.2.4. Con: Most of human efforts can be said to not be entirely positive. But that does not mean it is not positive.
1.1.3.1.1.4.2.5. Pro: Time and time again, we see examples of religion being very harmful to society: for example, gay conversion therapy being continually pushed by Christians.
1.1.3.2. Con: Donations to tax-exempt entities can usually be offset against tax, by corporations, companies and individuals.
1.1.4. Con: The tax exempt status has been abused by religion. The churches no longer do the extensive charity they did in the past; they're simply amassing greater power through fear, intimidation and wealth. They need to give their fair share. From the statistics on ["Charity can replace Welfare"](http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-welfarecharity.htm) it shows clearly that charities \(churches in particular\) take in more than they give.
1.1.5. Con: Many churches provide a benefit only to their [followers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/09/17/churches-are-more-club-than-public-good-why-do-they-need-tax-exemptions/?utm_term=.2077d63168a4), unlike most charities.
1.1.5.1. Con: A benefit to church followers is still a charitable benefit, so churches should still be eligible for the same exemptions as normal charities.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Most charitable entities practice some form of discrimination even if it's just verifying income. There isn't anything wrong with a church getting deductions for helping its members because that still benefits society as a whole. Those members get the help they need and don't have to turn to government programs or other charitable organizations.
1.1.5.1.2. Con: Charity is usually dispensed to those most in need of it. Charity that benefits only a select group of individuals based on their religious affiliation is discriminatory and contradicts the spirit of charitable activity.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: Many charities offer services only to specific groups or demographics, for example [women](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/22/female-focused-charities-support_n_7307076.html) or [ex-convicts](http://bouncebackproject.com/). This is targeted social support, not discrimination, and it does not make their charitable work less valid.
1.1.5.2. Con: Religious organisations tend to offer services broadly, often with no religious requirement - in many American cities, the [majority of beds](https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2017/march/christian-approach-fighting-homelessness-pays-off-baylor.html) for homeless people are offered by faith-based organisations.
1.1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.2.1.
1.1.5.4. Pro: Some religions, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, refuse to help non-believers.
1.1.5.4.1. Con: From the perspective of Jehovah's Witnesses, offering people salvation via proselytisation [is a form of charity](https://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/quotes/charity.php) in itself.
1.1.5.4.1.1. Pro: From the point of view of religious organisations, convincing others of their faith - and thus guaranteeing them spiritual benefits - is itself an act of charity.
1.1.5.5. Con: The great majority of religions are open to and in fact actively seek new members, meaning that their scope of membership is not discriminatory.
1.1.6. Con: If churches want tax exempt status they should have to prove that they are not for profit and provide public goods like other [501\(c\)\(3\)s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_1023).
1.1.6.1. Pro: The Bible says: "by their fruits ye shall know them". Any church doing good will easily maintain their tax exemptions and any church not doing good will lose it.
1.1.6.2. Con: Small churches that are already struggling to survive may find it difficult to meet the burden of consistently proving their eligibility for a tax exemption.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: This same argument can be applied to small charities and non-profits, which are nevertheless required to file for tax exempt status. The state can provide [detailed guidance](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/applying-for-tax-exempt-status) to such organisations to ease the burden of applying.
1.1.6.3. Pro: Many American churches already classify themselves as non-profit [religious corporations](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/is-a-corporation-like-a-church) under Section 501\(c\)\(3\) of the Internal Revenue Code.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: Religious corporations do not pay tax in some instances because they meet the same [classifications](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/is-a-corporation-like-a-church) as churches. If tax-exempt status were to be revoked, they would pay taxes regardless of whether they become corporations.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: [Hobby Lobby](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/is-a-corporation-like-a-church) is classified as a religious corporation but still pays corporate taxes.
1.1.6.4. Pro: If the church is listed as a non-profit then it would be exempt from taxes, but all employees should have to pay full taxes on their income. This would be the only way the church as an organisation would get to not pay taxes.
1.1.6.5. Con: Churches are different than even tax-exempted non-profits in that non-profits are part of the service industry, but have to prove they are non-profit. The only service churches provide is to god as a place of worship. Any extracurriculars outside of church operation such as selling teeshirts or charging the public for parking is still subject to sales tax and self-employment tax.
1.1.6.5.1. Con: Churches can claim tax exemption [fairly easily](https://churchexecutive.com/archives/does-the-church-bake-sale-threaten-your-tax-exempt-status) for additional activities such as tee shirt sales or coffee shops in their place of worship as long as they can prove it is related to the religious or charitable purposes of the organization.
1.1.6.6. Pro: If a church behaves in the same way as a charity, then there should be no problem with them applying for and having charity status granted to them.
1.1.6.7. Pro: Actual charities are required to divulge their financials as to how they are spending the charitable giving. Churches should adhere to the same standards.
1.1.6.7.1. Con: Arguing that churches should have to disclose their financials in order to maintain their tax-exempt status is not the same as saying they should not receive that status.
1.1.7. Con: Churches are non-profit but not necessarily charitable, as much of their receipts may go to proselytizing. E.g., according to the LDS \(Mormon\) website, "As the Church is not a financial or for-profit institution, its resources are used for the objective of preaching the gospel and inviting all to come unto Christ." [www.lds.org](https://www.lds.org/church/news/read-a-summary-of-the-financial-information-released-by-the-church?lang=eng).
1.1.8. Pro: In the US, [73% of total giving](http://theconversation.com/how-religion-motivates-people-to-give-and-serve-81662) went to a religious organization or house of worship.
1.1.8.1. Con: It is possible that religious institutions use a large amount of this money for non-charitable endeavours, meaning this is not really charitable giving.
1.1.8.1.1. Con: Even if this is the case, [statistics](http://theconversation.com/how-religion-motivates-people-to-give-and-serve-81662) suggest that Americans might not give as much if not for religious organizations.
1.1.9. Con: Treating any church like a charity is inherently a bad idea as different governments will recognise different religions. There are no universally recognised guidelines to follow.
1.1.9.1. Con: Automatic tax exemptions for churches safeguard against possible political hostility towards specific religions, which could result in unfair treatment and an infringement on freedom of religion.
1.1.9.1.1. Con: Taxation is not the only political lever that can be used to infringe on freedom of religion. This argument singles out taxation unfairly.
1.1.9.1.2. Pro: If the state begins granting financial favours to certain religious institutions but not others, this allows the state to express bias towards certain religions, thus undermining the separation between church and state.
1.1.9.1.2.1. Pro: There are, for example, [only two](https://civil.services/us-house/list/muslim-representatives) Muslim members of Congress, which is over [ninety percent Christian](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/incoming-congress-has-a-bigger-christian-majority-than-the-american-public_us_586beef3e4b0d9a5945cb162). There is a very good chance that this unequal political representation could lead to this rule being enforced in a way which preferentially grants tax exemptions to Christian churches, while branding Muslim religious organisations "intolerant".
1.1.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: In Germany, which has a [case-by-case taxation system for religious institutions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-mosques-insig-idUSKCN12S0HE), mosques are not granted access to state taxation revenue while synagogues and Christian churches are.
1.1.9.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This is because the [four main organizations](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-mosques-insig/in-germany-syrians-find-mosques-too-conservative-idUSKCN12S0HE) that represent Muslims in Germany can’t agree to merge into one religious body, a requirement to receive taxes, not because of government discrimination.
1.1.9.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: The lack of government funding for the Mosques in Germany has lead to [increased influence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-mosques-insig/in-germany-syrians-find-mosques-too-conservative-idUSKCN12S0HE) by donors with special interests. Many are now supported by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. Some back ultra-conservative or highly literal interpretations of Islam, such as Wahhabism or Salafism.
1.1.9.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Much of the problem with terrorism does not come from normal moderate Muslims but arises because of the radicalization of Muslim immigrants to Germany by Wahhabi Salafi hate preachers who incite youth to hate and do violence toward German democracy, Jews and create terror in public places as acts of obedience to the ISIS Caliph Abū Bakr al-Baghdadi. [www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/germany-salafi-enemy-within-alexander-athos/?published=t)[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/germany-salafi-enemy-within-alexander-athos/?published=t)
1.1.10. Con: Government gives money to charity indirectly by not collecting churches' fair share of tax money. If society feels the government ought to be giving money to charity, then it should be giving money directly to charities to ensure that the money is delivered where it was mandated to by the people. It is unclear, at this point, if there is even a collective will that tax money should be spent on charitable work.
1.1.11. Con: If an organization is supposedly about helping others and allowing people to find their purpose then they should not be exempt from paying taxes, which ultimately help their municipality and province/state run more efficiently and create a more egalitarian approach.
1.1.11.1. Pro: The fewer resources a state has, the more need there is for charitable work. By not taxing churches, the state loses out on resources.
1.1.12. Pro: It would result in an unfair situation if religious charities lost their tax-exempt status while atheist or agnostic charities kept theirs, creating an implicit bias against religious charities, even though both charities do the same thing \(such as run hospitals, provide homeless shelters, etc.\).
1.1.12.1. Con: The church's charities could remain exempted from those taxes.
1.1.12.2. Con: Strictly speaking the current status is unfair, because the non-church charities need to meet certain conditions to be tax free, while the so-called religious enterprises don't.
1.1.12.3. Con: Since they discriminate against certain groups of people, religious institutions should not morally be considered charities.
1.1.12.3.1. Con: Churches aren't discriminating against anyone. They only withhold their funds from non-members, so that they can focus their efforts on those willing to be part of the same organisation that supports them in return. They're not preventing anyone from becoming part of their local church.
1.1.12.3.2. Pro: -> See discussion #18593: Religious exemptions to discrimination laws should be abolished.
1.1.12.3.3. Pro: Discrimination is defined as the: the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex. There are certain categories of individuals that most churches would never accept as members, not giving them benefits and therefore discriminating against. Many of the large churches do not accept atheists and LGBT as members.
1.1.12.3.3.1. Pro: Summary of denominational positions in North America and Europe: [Church denominational positions concerning members in homosexual relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominational_positions_on_homosexuality#Summary_of_denominational_positions_in_North_America_and_Europe). As can be seen in the table, some churches discriminate against homosexual individuals, not allowing them to be members.
1.1.13. Pro: Some churches will struggle to stay open with the burden of taxes, leading to closures.
1.1.13.1. Con: While the number varies considerably depending on source, the number of Christian denominations is probably at least 30,000, and skisms continue to occur over doctrinal differences. The public shouldn't be required to subsidize every tiny religious fragment. Let the free market weed out failing churches. \(One study puts the global denomination count at 45,000: [www.gordonconwell.edu](http://www.gordonconwell.edu/resources/documents/StatusOfGlobalMission.pdf) \)
1.1.13.1.1. Con: Religion, and belief in general, should not be viewed as a merchandise, nor should it be something that is thrown into a free market where people can only choose what is popular.
1.1.13.1.1.1. Pro: Both the UN \([un.org](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html)\) and the EU Human Rights Declarations include : "either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance". Actions that limit or reduce the freedom of an individual to practice their religion, including in public, such as letting a free market ideology favour the popular religions at the expense of less popular ones, goes against the right of freedom of religion as described above.
1.1.13.1.1.1.1. Con: The government's budget covers all citizens, and it is a zero-sum problem. When the government confers a benefit on one party or group, there is an equivalent burden imposed on others. At the same time, each and every citizen has the freedom to practice their own religious beliefs. If group A is struggling and group B is going strong, why should B be burdened to help A? A & B have the same rights. B must decrease its charitable efforts or outreach so A can keep the doors open and the lights on.
1.1.13.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Economy is not a zero-sum game, otherwise there would be no economic growth, and only exchanges of money, which is obviously not the case. Thus, it is wrong to say that if the government confers a benefit to one party, others have an equal burden. Said first party may create value from the government's benefit that goes on to benefit the others in turn.
1.1.13.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is correct to say the "economy" is not such a game, but here we are only referring to the budget of the government. Growth in the economy plays out in the private sector. That growth will generally increase revenues, but outlays are essentially fixed by Congress. If we were to get to a period of surpluses, then the point would need to be conceded.
1.1.13.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Assuming group A and group B are religious organisations that promote positive principles such as solidarity, cooperation, and helping each other, and assuming economy would truly be a zero-sum game; then one would expect group B to help group A, or demonstrate intellectual hypocrisy. If the first postulate is false, then they should not be tax-exempt.
1.1.13.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Zero-sum Economy. There are revenue, services, and debt. They are balanced according to national priorities, and each benefits or burdens one or more groups depending on whether it is increased or decreased. We cannot reduce revenue without reducing services or increasing debt. Whenever we shift priorities there will be winners and losers; comparing relative cost/benefit will never be simple, but we do know that to benefit some, we must burden others.
1.1.13.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: When a church goes up in a community, the property tax burden then shifts to the other residences in the community. Since the church is exempt, other community members share the burden.
1.1.13.1.1.2. Con: Regardless of how we might characterize beliefs, there is a marketplace of ideas out there. Religious institutions exist in that marketplace whether we intend it or not. Beliefs can and do change. Over time, there has been a move away from rigid interpretations to those that are more flexible. In the US, the ranks of the unaffiliated are growing rapidly and have become a third of the country. They might like the Unitarians with their "freedom of belief" policy. [pewresearch.org](http://www.pewresearch.org/topics/religiously-unaffiliated/)
1.1.13.2. Pro: Small churches often support the disadvantaged and poor people in their communities, and will be the most financially burdened by the removal of the tax exemption.
1.1.13.2.1. Con: There are numerous secular charities doing comparable work, yet they all have to apply for exemption. There is no reason this should be any different.
1.1.13.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.1.13.3. Pro: Closures will likely concentrate in communities that cannot afford the donations to keep their places of worship open. This will mean a restriction of access to religion in the poorest communities.
1.1.13.3.1. Con: Worship does not require a "place." People are free to have small scripture study groups. Having the relevant scriptures and fellow believers in the community is all of the "access" that is needed.
1.1.13.3.1.1. Con: There exists many different kinds of worship. It is -highly- unlikely that absolutely none of those need a specific place of worship. For example, most [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_worship#Christianity) worship takes place in specifically consecrated churches.
1.1.13.3.1.2. Con: This does not take into consideration the high impact religion has on community and self-identity. Even if a specific belief does not "need" a place for worship, having one is part of the social benefits of religion: bringing people and communities together.
1.1.13.4. Pro: A tax burden will disproportionately benefit large religious groups over small. This will give majority views within any given religion an advantage in theological discourse to the detriment of religious minorities.
1.1.13.4.1. Con: Large groups generally own considerable land and structures, and have more employees. They also bring in considerably more money. Small groups struggling financially will not have profits to tax and could rent instead of own a gathering place, or use their own homes.
1.1.13.4.2. Pro: [Smaller religious groups](http://www.christiansunitedstatement.org/) often serve as important voices pushing for more progressive values within a given faith, a benefit that may be lost if a lack of tax exemptions makes it harder for them to operate.
1.1.13.4.2.1. Con: Just as well as some being progressive, other smaller fractions of any particular faith can be reactionary or in fact extremist. There is no easy way to discriminate between the effects on these.
1.1.13.5. Pro: 20% of congregations are already [struggling financially](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/2011-04-21-churches_recession-money_21_ST_N.htm). Many of these wouldn't survive further financial burdens.
1.1.14. Pro: Money donated to a church is often to support a religious goal \(often set by members\), and not for an expected service, much as other non-profits.
1.1.14.1. Con: Prosperity preaching is more in line with the self help phenomenon rather than classical religion. We would not let fans of [Tony Robbins](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/biography/) have tax exempt status.
1.1.14.1.1. Con: Tony Robbins would not receive a tax exemption because he profits from his talks. [Secular organisations](https://www.aynrand.org/) which espouse the ideal of wealth acquisition without themselves profiting do receive tax exemptions.
1.1.14.1.1.1. Con: Megachurches, particularly those preaching [Prosperity Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology), are solely focused on generating personal wealth, often to the detriment of the congregation and benefit of the preacher. Only the charitable service arms should be tax exempt.
1.1.15. Con: Despite being given automatic tax exemptions by the government \(due to them being a charitable organization\), churches are not legally obligated to act charitable or provide any public service that would be considered charitable.
1.1.16. Pro: The Catholic Church is the [largest](https://www.economist.com/node/21560536) single charitable organization in the United States.
1.1.16.1. Pro: [Catholic Charities USA](https://www.economist.com/node/21560536), its main charity, and its subsidiaries employ over 65,000 paid staff and serve over 10 million people.
1.1.16.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.13.2.1.
1.1.16.2. Con: The state of being a religion does not imply the exercise of charitable work, regardless of the existence of cases where they do such work.
1.1.16.2.1. Con: The state of being a church implies dispensing religious services for free, which could be considered a form of charity.
1.1.16.2.1.1. Con: Unsolicited religious services such as proselytising can hardly be considered a form of charity.
1.1.16.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.4.1.1.
1.1.16.2.1.2. Con: It is not true that churches by definition provide their services for free. While there may not be formal charges, many churches [aggressively solicit large donations](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/14/us/sunday-stickup/index.html) from attendees, citing scripture in order to claim that they are obliged to give.
1.1.16.2.2. Pro: There should be a way to log charitable deeds. Then tax breaks could be issued when a church passes a specific threshold.
1.1.16.2.2.1. Con: Churches provide a holistic range of charitable services, many of which are not material and thus cannot be quantified for the purposes of taxation.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1. Pro: All genuine religious groups, regardless of whether they carry out material charitable work such as running soup kitchens, are providing a philanthropic social service.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Many of the social benefits which churches provide are by definition not material. Churches tend to individuals' spiritual wellbeing, usually for no profit. This is a philanthropic activity which should qualify for tax exemption.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Organized religion raises happiness and contentment with life for individuals.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Religion provides people with purpose and guidelines for how to live.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Churches generally allow their followers to feel more at peace with their place in the universe through some kind of order.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Churches often use unproven negative consequences and unnecessary guilt to shame their followers into leading to depression.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Social networks created by church communities lead to [higher levels of happiness](https://www.livescience.com/9090-religion-people-happier-hint-god.html) among church goers than non-believers.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Studies on this phenomenon do not show that religion offers a special type of network that is superior to other types. It might be that secular social networks work just as well in increasing life satisfaction.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.4. Con: This really only applies when you are in a [social majority](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/201211/are-religious-people-happier) religion. Feeling part of the mainstream may be comforting whereas being in the minority is stressful.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: People from religious minorities usually also belong to cultural and ethnic minorities, so the feeling of isolation from the mainstream is not wholly due to their religious practices.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.5. Con: [Negative religious beliefs](https://www.livescience.com/52197-religion-mental-health-brain.html) \(for example, that God is punishing or abandoning you\) have been linked with harmful outcomes, including higher rates of depression and lower quality of life.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: Churches often provide solace and comfort for people going through difficult times. Religious leaders are often counselors and friends for those who need help.
1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.7. Pro: Providing for the spiritual, emotional and physical needs of church members and the surrounding community is considered charity work by some people.
1.1.17. Pro: [World Vision](https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos/world_vision_international/) \(just a portion of the American church's effort to alleviate poverty\) spends roughly $2.8 billion annually to care for the poor.
1.1.17.1. Con: [World Vision](https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos/world_vision_international/) is not primarily funded by church donations. It is in fact mostly funded by grants from various governments and the U.N.
1.1.18. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.2.
1.1.19. Con: -> See 1.1.16.2.
1.2. Con: Religion in itself is a social benefit, and therefore religious organizations deserve to maintain their tax-exempt status.
1.2.1. Con: Tax revenue raised from churches would be distributed widely for essential services into the wider community, but done so with a full democratic mandate.
1.2.2. Pro: Religion promotes volunteerism.
1.2.2.1. Pro: A study on the global impact of volunteerism showed that a significant portion of it is done by people who are part of a religious organization or non-profit ministry. According to the [Johns Hopkins Center for Civil Society Studies](https://ccss.jhu.edu/research-projects/vmp/), it‘s estimated that volunteers contribute around $400 billion to the global economy annually.
1.2.3. Pro: Religious people view their temples as something more sacred than the government. To tax money donated to the centre of these people's communities would put unnecessary strain on the most important pillar for some communities. For example, Christians see their contribution as a voluntary tax given to the governing body of their group; the church. That way the church can help the community personally instead of administratively.
1.2.4. Pro: Churches are presently classified as non-profits for exactly this reason. Unless we want to tax all non-profits, we can’t tax churches.
1.2.4.1. Con: If we want to treat churches as all other non-profits, then they also need to present their profit margins, their accounts, where they are putting their money, the results of their work for society, etc.
1.2.5. Pro: Religions that do not provide any social benefit \(that function as tax shelters\) should have their tax exemption removed specifically because they are not actually religions. Real religions do not deserve to be punished for the abuses of the few.
1.2.5.1. Con: It is very difficult to differentiate legally between "socially beneficial" religions and ones that do not provide any social benefit. This is because it is very easy for any group to do a minimal amount of charitable activity or religious ceremony and claim that they are legitimate.
1.2.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.16.2.2.1.1.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Tax exempt status should not be automatic. The operations, aspirations and beneficiaries should be examined initially and periodically reviewed for each entity, and tax exempt status awarded on a case-by-case basis.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: There would be considerable overhead to periodically review every American religious organization. That could actually cost taxpayers more in the long run.
1.2.5.3.1.1. Con: The very fact tax exemption is no longer automatic, may deter a good number of business-oriented \(as opposed to charity-oriented\) religious organisations from even applying. As a result, it is also quite possible that the cost of reviewing remains less than the increased income from taxing business-oriented religious organisations.
1.2.5.3.2. Pro: Here's a powerful case in point: As described in the [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/opinion/church-irs-tax-breaks.html) , "Focus on the Family," a conservative Christian organization, recently declared itself a church. They have no congregation, conduct no services, and provide no ceremonies, yet they have a $90 million budget which they use to support politicians and political issues. Legitimate churches should be angered by this.
1.2.5.3.3. Pro: It is beneficial for a church's congregation that the leaders remain accountable to the government for their activities and distribution of donations, in order to spot any potential corruption before it gets out of hand.
1.2.5.3.4. Pro: Churches that specifically undertake charitable work which benefits society beyond their members should be able to apply for exemption for that particular activity.
1.2.5.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.
1.2.5.3.6. Pro: Churches should demonstrate and show material social contribution to claim a proportional tax credit - can include congregational numbers and local pastoral services - as well as any outreach support.
1.2.5.3.6.1. Con: In much the same way non-profits cannot quantify effectively 'social benefit,' churches shouldn't be forced to quantify social benefit.
1.2.6. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.4.2.
1.2.7. Con: Religion is a spiritual good that private individuals consume. Even if those individuals benefit from that consumption, this does not make religion a "social good," in the same way that other private goods are not social goods.
1.2.7.1. Con: If the consumption of religion has spillover benefits to other people - for example, by making the consumer more likely to behave morally - then religion does constitute a social good.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: That's a massive "If." It is a well documented and proven fact that when you compare criminality and religiosity by specific areas, there is a direct correlation between religious fervor and crime. The more secular an area is, the safer the community it has. [latimes.com](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-1101-zuckerman-violence-secularism-20151101-story.html)
1.2.7.2. Con: Religious groups subsidise the state's social safety net by providing a wide variety of social support services free of charge, which constitutes a social good.
1.2.7.2.1. Pro: The services that churches provide are very much public - the Catholic Church, for example, provides [a massive amount of social services](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/19/frank-keating/does-catholic-church-provide-half-social-services-/) to the general public in a broad range of categories.
1.2.7.2.1.1. Pro: These programmes benefit everyone, not just their direct recipients, because they save the government, and thus the taxpayer, huge amounts of money.
1.2.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: The IRS [explicitly](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exempt-purposes-internal-revenue-code-section-501c3) lists "lessening the burdens of government" as a "charitable purpose" for an organisation to have on its website, endorsing the view that charitable work saves the taxpayer money.
1.2.7.2.1.2. Con: It would be fair to allow tax-exemption for activities related to provision of social services but not to the Church as a whole.
1.2.7.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.16.
1.2.7.2.1.4. Con: Those services are used to achieve Church's goals usually by promoting a certain lifestyle model. One cannot say that they come without strings attached i.e. services and teaching are bundled together.
1.2.7.2.1.4.1. Con: Promoting a certain lifestyle model, especially in a non-compulsory way, whilst providing charitable services does not mean those services cease to be charitable.
1.2.7.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.1.1.
1.2.7.3. Pro: Religions are not necessarily a social benefit. The actions of charities are, but these exist without religious connotations and minorities who pocket money. Trading faith for money can be viewed as a commerce, and thus churches should pay taxes.
1.2.8. Con: Religion at large is detrimental to human progress. It perpetuates ignorance, non-reason, and perhaps worst of all overpopulation. Subsidizing it is therefore contrary to humanity's long-term survival and prosperity.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Multiple organised religions can be rightfully accused of hindering scientific progress, both today and in the past.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: The Catholic Church [forced](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13618460.600-vatican-admits-galileo-was-right-/) Galileo to recant his theory that the Earth moves around the Sun, under threat of torture.
1.2.8.1.2. Con: The Catholic Church has, in recent years, been a strong advocate for environmentalism. Pope Francis [acknowledges](http://www.catholicclimatecovenant.org/encyclical) that Climate Change is real, caused by man, and an urgent threat.
1.2.8.1.3. Con: The Qur'an [exhorts](http://www.encyclopedias.biz/dw/Encyclopedia%20of%20Quran.pdf) Muslims to study nature and investigate the truth. This is why Muslims have contributed [greatly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_attitudes_towards_science#Classical_science_in_the_Muslim_world) to global scientific advancement.
1.2.8.1.4. Pro: Scientific explanations [frequently disprove](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/24/big-issue-no-mystery-science-and-religion-cannot-be-reconciled) major parts of religions, making followers antagonistic to science.
1.2.9. Con: Faith can be practiced in smaller communities or in larger groups living off donations. It is true that some religious groups do charitable work but we should rather support charitable groups with tax exemption than churches.
1.2.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.
1.2.11. Pro: Religion usually enforces positive moral codes that make citizens more likely to follow the law and do good unto others.
1.2.11.1. Pro: Religions often place social and community pressure on individuals to do good deeds like charity or community service.
1.2.11.2. Con: Moral codes ingrained through secular teachings are better, since those moral codes are not anchored to religious texts and are free to evolve over time.
1.2.11.2.1. Con: Secular moral codes do not have the same divine authority as religious teachings, making it easier for individuals to disobey.
1.2.11.2.1.1. Con: A moral code that is followed due to fear of divine authority is inferior to a secular moral code that is developed through an understanding of one's rights and obligations towards fellow members of the society.
1.2.11.3. Pro: People who identify as religious are [less likely](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-briggs/no-time-for-crime-study-f_b_4384046.html) to be criminal offenders.
1.2.11.4. Con: Countries with higher rates of secularism have [lower rates](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-1101-zuckerman-violence-secularism-20151101-story.html) of crime.
1.2.11.4.1. Con: Countries with higher rates of secularism also share many other factors such as stable governments, rule of law, high standards of living, and lower inequality. These are more likely to account for lower crime rates than secularism.
1.2.11.5. Pro: Some variant of the [golden rule](http://www.iep.utm.edu/goldrule/) is [found](http://www.religioustolerance.org/reciproc2.htm) in most major religions.
1.2.11.6. Con: Evidence shows that religious children are [not more altruistic](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/researchgate/religious-children-arent_b_14248680.html) than nonreligious children.
1.2.12. Con: The characteristic of a social benefit does not in itself provide a rationale for exemption from tax. Any service that people are prepared to pay for provides a social benefit by definition. Religion is unremarkable in this respect.
1.2.12.1. Pro: The local sports club, swimming pool and gymnasium provide social benefit and pay tax.
1.2.12.1.1. Con: Local sports clubs or swimming pools, if run in order to provide social benefit at no profit, [qualify](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exempt-purposes-internal-revenue-code-section-501c3) for a tax exemption in just the same way as a church.
1.2.12.2. Pro: Social benefit can accrue from tax paying organisations; it could be argued more so, merely because they pay tax.
1.2.12.3. Pro: A dating service provides a social benefit.
1.2.12.4. Pro: Utility companies provide a social benefit, but are taxed accordingly.
1.2.13. Con: Religions do not provide a clear benefit to those who do not follow their teachings. It is inappropriate for a religious organisation to expect those who do not support its message to support it financially via a tax exempt status.
1.2.13.1. Pro: Religions don’t generate value to a secular society or government. They often generate huge wealth among closed group members.
1.2.13.1.1. Pro: Churches are businesses that make money.
1.2.13.1.1.1. Pro: Religious organizations profit from their [“intellectual property”](https://churchexecutive.com/archives/legal-realities-5) output, like a newspaper. Indeed there are mega churches who appear to be businesses outright.
1.2.13.1.1.2. Pro: Voluntary donations to Churches may be used as a way to [launder money](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35104997).
1.2.13.1.1.3. Pro: Some religious organisations [expect/demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe#Church_collection_of_religious_offerings_and_taxes) their followers to provide some form of financial support, directly or indirectly via government-collected taxes. This puts them in a corporate position. Therefore, they should be taxed.
1.2.13.1.1.3.1. Pro: While most churches expect contributions from congregants \(they couldn't survive without income\), some faiths do pressure members to make contributions. The Mormon church says God demands members to tithe 10% of their income, and the church has 10s of billions in assets. They have been criticized for spending their wealth on real estate \(without concern for property taxes\) and opulent structures. [www.huffingtonpost.com](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/12/insight-mormon-church-mad_n_1769539.html)
1.2.13.1.1.4. Con: Most of the churches are not "business that make money", most of them have only enough to pay the bills. To tax those churches would be as good as closes them. Only big churches that sell products and services should be considerer for tax paying.
1.2.13.1.1.4.1. Pro: Churches shouldn't lose their tax exempt status. People tend to picture most churches as being large and run by very wealthy pastors. That's not the case. It's somewhat difficult to calculate avg. church size \(regularly attend vs. on the rolls\), but the average church only has about 75 people in attendance on any given Sunday morning, or about 20-25 families \([prodigalthought.net](https://prodigalthought.net/2011/01/26/the-average-church-size-in-america/)\). Most churches and pastors are on small budgets, but still contribute good work.
1.2.13.1.1.4.1.1. Con: If a church only has 25 families then the income would be low, and thus little tax to pay. This issue of poor churches could easily be solved by having a higher tax free threshold. Maybe $100,000 for instance.
1.2.13.1.1.5. Pro: Religious organisations are just as unscrupulous when managing their vast portfolio of assets for profit, or when sheltering their own employees from the law, as any other organisation. Thus they should not be granted any special status.
1.2.13.1.1.6. Pro: Any for-profit organisation should be subject to taxation. Though many individual churches are operated at a loss, the Church as an entity has always been for-profit, as indicated by the [wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_organizations) they've amassed overtime.
1.2.13.1.1.7. Pro: Tax write-offs of pastors from living costs covered by the church should be \(and usually are\) limited to modest accommodations and assets, and would not include mansions or private jets.
1.2.13.1.1.8. Pro: Self-proclaimed bishops such as Brian Tamaki extort money from 'god fearing' individuals only to spend it lavishly on themselves. [Tamaki's luxury trip on Social Media](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/72221190/Bishop-Tamaki-lords-his-month-long-luxury-trip-on-social-media).
1.2.13.1.1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.1.
1.2.13.1.1.9. Pro: Modern day churches have moved beyond traditional faith congregations and are now money making machines with revenue models beyond charity giving. Any revenue earned via business models should be treated like any other business model. Pretend deities don’t preclude tax.
1.2.13.1.1.9.1. Con: In accordance with freedom of religion, the state cannot discriminate against organisations just because it believes their deities are not real.
1.2.13.1.1.9.1.1. Con: Imposing taxation is not a form of discrimination. Taxes are levied according to financial transactions, not according to whatever beliefs one has.
1.2.13.1.1.10. Pro: A church is a service like any other. It is no different to a school, a therapy counselling service, a radio station, a theatrical play, concert, book promotion, dating service, and is in fact a combination of these and more funded through a donation for service model, patreon style.
1.2.13.1.1.10.1. Pro: Churches most definitely provide a service for their patrons, and like any service where money is exchanged, tax should be levied. Creating a protected class for religious groups is absurd by today's standards.
1.2.13.1.1.10.2. Con: Most or all of the above-listed services [qualify](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exempt-purposes-internal-revenue-code-section-501c3) for tax-exempt status so long as they are not being provided at a profit.
1.2.13.1.1.11. Pro: There are many cases of churches using their tax exempt status to pocket large sums of money.
1.2.13.1.1.11.1. Pro: The Mormon church has 10s of billions in assets, including significant real estate holdings without the strain of property taxes. The church has over a million acres of farmland. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finances_of_The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints#Assets)
1.2.13.1.1.11.2. Pro: The Catholic church is one of the wealthiest institutions in the world.
1.2.13.1.1.11.2.1. Pro: The Vatican Bank has [$8 billion in assets](http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/24/news/pope-francis-visit-vatican-catholic-church/index.html), it can afford to pay taxes.
1.2.13.1.1.11.3. Pro: The Church of Scientology has extremely high revenues, profiting [millions of dollars](http://fortune.com/2015/04/08/scientology-tax-exempt/)  just off of its tax exemption.
1.2.13.1.1.11.3.1. Pro: This [empowers](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-hassan/its-time-to-end-the-churc_b_555843.html) the unethical, potentially illegal, and most assuredly uncharitable activities of the Church of Scientology using “religion” as a cloak.
1.2.13.1.1.11.3.2. Pro: Churches that actively charge their members such as Scientology should be denied tax exemption as they are effectively businesses.
1.2.13.1.1.11.3.3. Con: Scientology was [initially refused](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/09/us/scientology-s-puzzling-journey-from-tax-rebel-to-tax-exempt.html) a tax exemption on the basis of these profits, being classed as a business rather than a church. It is perfectly consistent to argue that churches should receive a tax exemption, while business enterprises masquerading as churches solely for tax purposes should be prosecuted.
1.2.13.1.1.11.4. Pro: Megachurches bring in [billions](http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/21/religion.mega.church.christian/index.html) of dollars in profit.
1.2.13.1.1.11.5. Con: The fact that some churches might break the rules attendant upon their tax-exempt status is an argument for better enforcement of the rules, not for punishing law-abiding organisations for the wrongdoing of others by denying all churches a tax exemption.
1.2.13.1.1.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.11.2.1.
1.2.13.1.1.11.7. Con: This suggests that maybe a progressive tax would be beneficial, rather than taxing all religious organizations. We can't punish all for the crimes of the few.
1.2.13.1.1.12. Con: Corporate tax is paid by for-profit entities. If a church runs at a profit, it will pay corporate taxes. Churches are subject to the same rules as any other organization.
1.2.13.1.1.12.1. Pro: No business entity should be tax exempt. If there is anyone within the organization making any money, then taxes should be collected accordingly. In the case of religious organizations, they charge for marriage ceremonies, thus generating a profit. It should be taxable.
1.2.13.1.1.12.1.1. Con: There is no guarantee that fees collected for the performance of religious ceremonies lead to profits. Profits are accounts receivable minus accounts payable. To know if profits are made, the one needs to know total income and total liabilities.
1.2.13.1.1.12.1.2. Con: Employees of religious institutions still pay personal income and payroll taxes. Only the actual minister is relieved from those. The exemption is on the church income, e.g. donations.
1.2.13.1.1.12.2. Con: Churches automatically get 501\(c\)3 status, and they have additional perks. They aren't even subject to the same rules as other nonprofits. [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/09/22/lets-tax-churches/#d70e2c6322ba)
1.2.13.1.1.12.3. Con: This only applies to activities that fall under ["unrelated business income"](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/are-churches-always-exempt.html), while profits earned from bingo games, thrift shops, volunteer work, donor lists, low cost giveaways, and advertising are not taxed.
1.2.13.1.1.12.3.1. Con: The proceeds of such fundraising activities are rightly not taxed because they are used to fund the running costs of the church - so long as they are not enriching any individuals, they do not constitute profit.
1.2.13.1.1.13. Con: -> See 1.1.14.
1.2.13.1.1.14. Con: Individuals or corporations \(they are defined as same by US Title 26\) pay tax on net income after exclusions. Non-profits, such as religious groups, who have qualified for this designation by the IRS, by definition do not have income to be taxed. These entities are not "in commerce" and do not have profit/loss in the exercise of this.
1.2.13.1.1.14.1. Con: Tax-exempt nonprofits often make money as a result of their activities and use it to cover expenses. In fact, this income can be essential to an organization's survival. As long as a nonprofit's activities are associated with the nonprofit's purpose, any profit made from them isn't taxable- from google
1.2.13.1.1.15. Pro: Some 'churches' like [Hillsong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsong_Church#Criticism_of_finances?) receive tax breaks under a religious exemption, and yet it's basically a company organising music events, with the leaders pocketing huge sums from donations.
1.2.13.1.1.16. Pro: Any institution that has any degree of income should be taxed, without exception.
1.2.13.1.1.17. Pro: Churches, or more accurately, those running the churches, are sometimes using the church as a [cover for assets](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2017/04/13/irs-cant-tax-churches-but-fake-churches-can-trigger-tax-evasion-charges/#6ec5f5aa276e) that are not, in fact, used for charitable purposes. When the church leader is living in luxury on dollars that have not been taxed, that leader is essentially earning a tax-free living. We may not need to completely eliminate the tax-exempt status, but we certainly need to look at how and when it is applied. There need to be real limits to what tax-free dollars can buy.
1.2.13.1.1.18. Con: Churches are tax-empt only to the extent that their activities are related to their non-profit mission. For example, churches like other non-profits are subject to the [UBIT](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/unrelated-business-income-tax) \(unrelated business income tax\) as well as a 21% excise tax on compensation in excess of $1 million for the highest 5 paid individuals in the organization \([link](https://www.chapman.com/insights-publications-Excise_Tax_Compensation_Exempts_Tax_Reform.html)\).
1.2.13.1.1.19. Con: Universities pay no taxes on television revenue and corporate sponsorships for college sports, a multi-billion dollar industry \([link](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/sunday-review/college-sports-tax-dodge.html)\).
1.2.13.1.1.19.1. Con: If universities are reaping multi-billion dollar profits from televising collegiate sports while student debt skyrockets in this country, then they need to start paying taxes too.
1.2.13.1.1.19.2. Con: Pointing to other non-profits is a red herring fallacy. The question is concerning Churches. Public universities are predominantly funded by public means through a national or subnational government [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university)
1.2.13.1.1.20. Con: The [definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/tax) of tax is “a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers' income and business profits or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions.” Churches do not have profits, and they do not sell any goods or services. The case should not be why should they be exempt, but why they should be forced to contribute to government income.
1.2.13.1.1.20.1. Con: Just because they don't create anything physical, does not mean they are not selling a service, just like a therapist or theatrical production is selling a service. It's not beliefs that would be taxed, but money changing hands.
1.2.13.1.1.20.2. Con: They occasionally sell goods, as during a rummage or bake sale, and they even call a scheduled gathering a "service".
1.2.13.1.1.20.2.1. Pro: A lot of people make regular payments to these organizations, and they would not do that unless they perceived some benefit conferred from the exchange. It can't be mere altruism or people would pay even if they didn't attend.
1.2.13.1.1.21. Pro: There is no church that spends all of its money on charity. So the leaders should prove the percentage that has been given to charity, and pay taxes for the percentage they take for themselves and the church itself.
1.2.13.2. Con: Most government programs only help a certain subset of the population.
1.2.13.3. Con: Religion doesn't require that many approve of their practice. It is mainly important that they don't infringe on the rights of others in their practice.
1.2.13.4. Con: Refraining from taxing an organisation is not the same as forcing people to pay money to support that organisation.
1.2.13.4.1. Con: Whatever property taxes are avoided by the church must be made up by other local property owners.
1.2.14. Pro: Religious institutions provide cultural benefits — moral guidance, connection with heritage, community involvement. These things are directly tied to the religious aspect of the institution, but in a larger sense they are not dissimilar from other non-exempt cultural institutions such as museums, historical societies, etc.
1.2.14.1. Pro: Non-profits like schools and the boy scouts and girl scouts of America promote morality. They emphasise moral behaviors like the 8th commandment \(thou shalt not lie\) and the 4th commandment \(respect for elders\).
1.2.14.2. Pro: Morality is important to control crime rates in the general community.
1.2.14.3. Con: Museums and historical societies do not typically engage in activism or charity and generally do not espouse a particular political or moral ideology. Churches specifically do. As such, they should be treated like other similar groups.
1.2.14.3.1. Con: Museums and galleries are [highly political institutions](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/arts/design/moma-protests-trump-entry-ban-with-work-by-artists-from-muslim-nations.html) and often engage in activism of an ideological nature, just as churches do.
1.2.14.3.2. Con: Many secular charitable groups are [explicitly activist](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/), and yet remain entitled to tax exemptions.
1.2.15. Con: Religion is too broad of a term to stake a claim that it is a social benefit. There are entirely too many different beliefs that people would consider a detriment to society. You could make this claim about a singular church with economical, sociological, and psychological proof to their community, but arguing religion as a whole has too many conflicting variables.
1.2.16. Con: Many major religions like Christianity and Islam promote [tribalism](https://www.salon.com/2014/11/17/6_reasons_why_religion_does_more_harm_than_good_partner/) through the depiction of evil in the world which creates in and out groups.
1.2.16.1. Pro: This tribalism can breed social exclusion, prejudice, and in some instances even violence.
1.2.16.2. Pro: Many churches proselytize to the recipients of their benefits.
1.2.16.3. Con: The concept of evil, and the creation of out-groups, is [far from exclusive](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/26/opinions/axis-of-evil-is-back-miller-sokolsky/index.html) to religious organisations, and features prominently in secular politics.
1.2.16.3.1. Con: This is a version of the [bandwagon fallacy](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-bandwagon-fallacy-1689158). Secular politics does create societal rifts, but adding yet another source of us-versus-them thinking only compounds the problem.
1.2.17. Con: Religion anchors thinking to the age where its texts were written. In most cases this is the [Iron Age](https://www.salon.com/2014/11/17/6_reasons_why_religion_does_more_harm_than_good_partner/), a time of rampant superstition, ignorance, inequality, racism, misogyny, and violence.
1.2.17.1. Con: Texts about morality do not need to be interpreted literally in order to still be influential. For example, Aristotelian ethics are still hugely influential, even though Aristotle held numerous problematic ethical beliefs.
1.2.17.1.1. Con: While there has been a slow move away from fundamentalist interpretations, [21%](http://file:///C:/Users/Ed/Desktop/Religion/Biblical%20literalism.pdf) of Catholics, against the direction of the Vatican, are literalists, and almost 1/3 of all Americans have a [literal](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/interpreting-scripture/) interpretation of the Bible.
1.2.17.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.
1.2.17.3. Pro: Many beliefs and norms propagated by churches do not align with modern views, and these should not be endorsed by providing a tax break.
1.2.17.3.1. Con: Granting tax breaks to churches is not an all-or-nothing proposition. The state could only grant tax breaks to churches that espouse modern, socially progressive views.
1.2.17.3.1.1. Pro: The state could preferentially grant tax exemptions to churches that are tolerant towards women and LGBT people.
1.2.17.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.
1.2.17.3.1.1.2. Con: Imposing social views on religious communities may contradict the core moral teachings of their religion and therefore limit the freedom to practise one's religion.
1.2.17.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.17.3.1.1.2.
1.2.17.3.2. Con: Using legal means to punish groups whose views are conservative is an ineffective way of bringing about social change.
1.2.17.3.2.1. Pro: Denying conservative religious institutions tax exempt status on the basis of their views is likely to turn them into [free speech martyrs](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/08/the_ascent_of_google_employee_james_damore_to_free_speech_martyr_was_inevitable.html), generating public sympathy for their positions as individuals rally against what they see as a suppression of free speech.
1.2.17.3.3. Pro: The Catholic Church in the US takes a strong position that [condemns](http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/assisted-suicide/to-live-each-day/index.cfm) euthanasia.
1.2.17.3.4. Pro: The Catholic Church in the US maintains a strong position [against](http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/homosexuality/index.cfm) homosexuality and same-sex marriage.
1.2.17.3.4.1. Con: The positions of the Catholic Church on these issues are both [protected speech](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/01/us/free-speech-hate-speech-quiz/index.html) and expressions of [freedom of religion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment). Regardless of the prejudice which underlies such views, it is inappropriate for the state to financially punish religious institutions for constitutionally protected actions.
1.2.17.3.5. Pro: The Catholic Church in the US is a vociferous advocate against [abortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_and_the_Catholic_Church_in_the_United_States) and [contraception](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/catholic-church-and-contraception), both of which are heavily politicised issues.
1.2.17.3.5.1. Con: Religious views, and by extension religious organisations, have an important role in the debate surrounding heavily politicised issues.
1.2.17.3.5.1.1. Pro: Many people base their views on social issues such as abortion and contraception on their genuinely held religious convictions. Organisations which provide a large number of voters with moral guidance have just as much right to participate in ethical debates as their secular counterparts.
1.2.17.3.5.2. Con: According to the Church, these issues are not political by their nature. The belief that all human life is sacred is at the core of Catholic Church ideology. The Church promotes this faith-based moral position and this, by necessity, leads to its social and political position on the issues of abortion and contraception.
1.2.17.3.5.2.1. Con: This hasn't stopped many Church officials from [speaking out against](https://www.npr.org/2012/02/07/146511839/weekly-standard-obamacare-vs-the-catholics) Obama's healthcare reforms.
1.2.17.3.6. Con: The state does not restrict the freedom of speech of non-religious conservative organisations by denying them tax-exempt status, and it should not do so for churches.
1.2.17.3.6.1. Pro: There are [many churches](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/01/15/churches-that-welcome-gay-couples-see-congregations-grow/) which espouse progressive and inclusive views. Branding all churches as conservative by collectively denying them tax-exempt status is dishonest and harmful to progressive churches and their congregations.
1.2.17.3.6.1.1. Pro: Religion is an important source of meaning for many people, and it can be difficult for LGBT individuals to feel they must choose between religion and their identity. By propagating the idea that all churches are conservative, the state obscures the existence of progressive churches and makes people more likely to feel they must make that choice.
1.2.17.3.6.2. Pro: There are many [non-religious organisations](https://www.democratsforlife.org/) which advocate for conservative viewpoints and are nonetheless granted tax exempt status. It is hypocritical and blatantly discriminatory to only punish religious organisations for holding such views.
1.2.17.3.6.2.1. Pro: Even assuming that the state should grant preferential treatment to progressive organisations, using "church" as a proxy for "conservative" is an ineffective way to do so.
1.2.17.3.6.2.2. Pro: The right to freedom of religion is [constitutionally protected](https://www.aclu.org/issues/religious-liberty) in the United States, and discrimination on religious grounds, which this policy would entail, is unlawful.
1.2.17.3.6.3. Pro: Individuals and organisations are entitled to freedom of speech so long as they express themselves peacefully and lawfully. The state should not infringe this right by granting preferential treatment to organisations with which it agrees.
1.2.17.3.6.3.1. Pro: Preferential treatment by the state for certain organisations sounds fine when applied to views we already agree with, but the state is often [an enemy of social progress](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/13/us/states-same-sex-marriage-ban/index.html), and should not be trusted to choose which progressive views are legitimate and which are not.
1.2.17.3.6.4. Con: The issue is broader than just freedom of speech. Churches and church members \(in the name of the church\) take actions that negatively impact different segments of society. Church members can freely express their opinions, no question. It's when they take actions that negatively impact others that the church tax status should be re-examined.
1.2.17.3.7. Con: "Modern views" is a subjective criterion. The state should not define what a "modern view" is.
1.2.17.4. Con: It is simply not true to assert that religious organisations are necessarily bigoted or regressive. Groups such as the Quakers were at the forefront of the movement for the [abolition of slavery](http://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/11/-Anti-Slavery) and [black churches](https://www.aclu.org/blog/celebrating-martin-luther-king-jr-and-religious-freedom) were integral to the civil rights movement in the US.
1.2.17.4.1. Con: The claim above does not directly make that assertion. The scriptures of many religions record the events and wisdom of humans well before the dark ages, and even thousands of years before writing \(prehistoric\). It is simply a fact. Science has explained a great many things that were deemed supernatural back then.
1.2.17.4.2. Con: Religious organizations are not necessarily bigoted or regressive, but on June 4, 2018, a cake maker was at the Supreme Court because he felt it was his religious right to deny homosexuals service. The only reference to homosexuality in the Bible comes from the Old Testament.
1.2.17.5. Con: These texts are often vague and can be interpreted in ways that are progressive or empowering.
1.2.17.5.1. Con: At times these religious texts are [incredibly explicit.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/6120373/Top-10-worst-Bible-passages.html)
1.2.17.5.1.1. Pro: Many ethical, moral, or political issues are explicit in themselves. Explicit descriptions are sometimes needed.
1.2.17.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #2649: Morality is objective.
1.2.17.6. Pro: Religion at a large scale is not adaptive and actively discourages critical thinking so any moral guidance provided by religion can be largely out of step with modern knowledge and research. The sexual health issues are a clear example of this.
1.2.18. Pro: Houses of worship typically share a lot in common with other charities, providing a place to gather for the community like tax exempt clubs and often also running charitable benefits for the needy.
1.3. Con: Government itself is a [form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_religion) of religion.
1.3.1. Con: The concept of a government has no attributes of being supernatural. Government existence and effectiveness can be tested empirically so is not taken on faith. Religion appears to require faith so, no, it is not a religion.
1.3.2. Pro: The attributes ascribed to God: all-powerful, beneficent, worthy of faith, arbiter of morality, decider of fate, receiver of sacrifice; are usurped by authoritarian governments. The state becomes God. This is religion.
1.3.3. Con: This is a non-sequitur. The issue of whether or not a government is a religion has no bearing on the argument at hand.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.
1.5. Con: Governments that separate church and state aren't positioned to claim authority to tax churches, regardless of whether churches do social good.
1.5.1. Pro: Framers of these governments didn't want to put man-made institutions above god.
1.5.2. Pro: If authority comes from consent of the governed, then voluntary religion has more authority over its constituents than a compulsory nation-state. The nation-state then finds it very difficult to claim the authority to tax the church, outside of appeals to violent coercion.
1.5.2.1. Con: Residing within the borders of a nation-state implies consent.
1.5.2.2. Pro: -> See discussion #7734: Taxation is theft
1.5.3. Pro: Discussing power opens the discussion to the utilitarian benefit of church charity. Discussing authority makes the charity discussion, and other utilitarian discussions, moot.
1.5.4. Con: Governments have the authority to tax everyone, and churches are no exception.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The 16th Amendment of the US Constitution allows taxation on corporate incomes.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: The US Constitution is the ultimate law of the land.
1.5.5. Con: Governments that separate church \(or religious organisations\) and state aren't positioned to claim authority to tax churches.
1.5.6. Con: Churches that collect legal tender from their parishioners, fundraisers, and/or church run businesses give the government authority to choose to tax the church by dealing in the legal tender.
1.6. Con: If churches were stripped of their legal status as charities, they would require a new legal designation, likely gain corporate status and their financial situation would be affected.
1.6.1. Pro: US court case "Citizens United" gave corporations major clout to support political candidates in any and every way without much restriction. If we taxed religions, they would ultimately gain massive political power through this case.
1.6.1.1. Con: "...in any and every way without much restriction," is overstating the situation somewhat. Citizens United allows corporations and unions to fund \(super\) PACs with unlimited organizational funds, but they cannot give that money to candidates, nor are they permitted to coordinate directly with specific campaigns. [www.fec.gov](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/making-disbursements-pac/contribution-limits-nonconnected-pacs/)
1.6.1.2. Con: If we taxed them, churches would have less money to spend on political messaging.
1.6.1.3. Con: Marking churches as an organization clearly capable of political advocacy will also force the public to scrutinize their opinion more so.
1.6.1.3.1. Pro: They already wield massive political power. The influence of any church on any candidacy needs to be transparent to the general public, thereby facilitating an actual separation of church and state.
1.6.1.4. Con: [Citizens United](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/) did not allocate the freedom to espouse political messages according to whether or not an organisation pays tax. The status of churches under Citizens United will not change just because they begin to pay taxes.
1.6.2. Con: The topic isn't to take away the actual legal status of the church but to ensure that its income and its properties are being correctly taxed.
1.6.3. Con: Many churches and charities are already organized as corporations in the various U.S. states. \(A search for "First Baptist Church" \@ [mycpa.cpa.state.tx.us](https://mycpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/coaSearchBtn) produces many results\).
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.6.5. Pro: Churches with a corporate, income oriented, status will make the culture of religion more consumerist.
1.6.5.1. Pro: In order to combat rising costs and lower attendance, church leaders will be [pressured](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisladd/2017/03/30/organized-religion-is-being-replaced-by-disorganized-religion/#25a03577489c) to provide entertainment over substance oriented content in their sermons that will appeal to larger audiences.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: More entertaining and less judgemental sermons seem like a net positive.
1.6.5.2. Con: Consumerist religious culture will also mean that struggling faiths will be pressured into greater tolerance of groups that have traditionally been ignored by religious culture \(i.e. LGBTQIA individuals\) due to the need for more congregants.
1.7. Con: A tax exemption ensures the government is not involved in church finances, and therefore upholds the separation of church and state and ensures religious freedom.
1.7.1. Con: Churches request funding with no transparency as to the outcome and effectiveness of its use. By being tax accountable, important processes such as providing receipts to donors and providing financial statements become mandatory. It's a transparency issue.
1.7.2. Pro: The separation of Church and State, including tax exemption, is a solution to the age old question of whether the State or the Church holds ultimate power. By the founders saying "neither, they are separate," they provided a solution which allowed for the détente between the two necessary for liberal, pluralistic societies to grow and flourish.
1.7.3. Con: While separation of church and state is usually seen as an enumerated right in the US, nowhere in the First Amendment does it say that there's a separation of church and state. It clearly reads, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof". This only applies to Congress. That doesn't include state legislatures, ballot measures, or executive orders.
1.7.3.1. Con: The Supreme Court has held numerous times that a State action, law, or policy violated the "Establishment Clause." The Bill of Rights applies to the States vis the 14th Amendment. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights)
1.7.3.1.1. Pro: Public schools [may not teach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District) creationism.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: Religious monuments are generally [not permitted](https://www.foxnews.com/story/supreme-court-bars-commandments-from-courthouses) on State property.
1.7.3.2. Pro: There used to be [State funded churches](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel05.html) early in US history.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: [Religious taxes](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel05.html) were laid on all citizens, each of whom was given the option of designating his share to the Christian church of his choice. Such laws took effect in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire and were passed but not implemented in Maryland and Georgia.
1.7.3.3. Con: Separation of Church and State, through the Supreme Court, has been defined in much the same way Thomas Jefferson intended it, which puts its [legal scope](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause) far beyond the simple establishment of a state religion.
1.7.4. Pro: Religious organizations would feel that if they are forced to pay taxes, then they should also have a voice in government, since they are affected by government regulation.
1.7.4.1. Pro: One of the founders’ primary complaints was that there should be no taxation without representation. If this is true, it’s inverse is also true: there should be no representation without taxation. If the church expects representation of their core beliefs in government, they should contribute to maintain that government.
1.7.4.2. Con: Religious organizations do have somewhat of a voice in government: every member of that organization can vote a certain way, which can carry a large swing.
1.7.4.2.1. Con: There is a huge difference in the free individuals that happen to be members of an organization supporting one cause or another and the organization itself actively working to support one cause or another, just as there is a difference between employees of a company supporting one party or another and the company itself supporting a party.
1.7.4.3. Con: Many politicians are members of religious organizations as well, which can have a gigantic influence on political moves by that politician.
1.7.4.4. Pro: If the churches were to be taxed, this could lead to public outrage as it conflicts with public interest. It would be in the government's interest to avoid this and support public interest.
1.7.5. Con: Churches still have to follow government regulations and rules. Separation of church and state does not mean never interacting.
1.7.6. Pro: When Jesus was asked the most politically loaded question of his day, he said to "Give to Caesar what's Caesar's and to God what's God's". Jesus, a Jewish rabbi, a Muslim Prophet, a holy man and the namesake of the Christian religion spoke for the separation of church and state in terms of finances.
1.7.6.1. Con: Quotes from specific religions should not be used to justify national economic legislation.
1.7.6.2. Con: [Most](https://www.hbu.edu/center-for-christianity-in-business/legal-corner-item/render-unto-caesar-the-holy-calling-of-paying-taxes/) [interpretations](https://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20090804_1.htm) of this saying suggest that Jesus was encouraging his followers to pay their taxes out of deference to the material authority of the government, which is separate from the spiritual authority of God.
1.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.
1.7.8. Con: There is nothing about paying taxes that inserts the government into financial decisions a church makes.  Churches are free to use their money to pursue any legal use regardless of their requirement to pay for the services they use. Conflating taxes with decisions made by the church means that church use of services like roads and public utilities would also violate a separation of church and state.
1.7.9. Pro: The US Supreme Court [decision](https://churchesandtaxes.procon.org/sourcefiles/walz-v-tax-commission-of-the-city-of-new-york.pdf) in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York \(1970\): "The exemption creates only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state, and far less than taxation of churches. It restricts the fiscal relationship between church and state, and tends to complement and reinforce the desired separation insulating each from the other."
1.7.10. Pro: The US Supreme Court [decision](https://churchesandtaxes.procon.org/sourcefiles/walz-v-tax-commission-of-the-city-of-new-york.pdf) in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York \(1970\): "The grant of a tax exemption is not sponsorship, since the government does not transfer part of its revenue to churches, but simply abstains from demanding that the church support the state. No one has ever suggested that tax exemption has converted libraries, art galleries, or hospitals into arms of the state or put employees 'on the public payroll.'"
1.7.11. Con: Having the exemption has the notable negative side effect of making the IRS the [arbiter](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/churches-religious-organizations) of whether a group is actually a religion and thus undermines the separation of church and state.
1.7.12. Con: Separation of church and state means that there should be no religious tests for laws or public offices. It does not imply that religious institutions should be treated differently.
1.7.13. Pro: The First Amendment creates a barrier to “excessive entanglement” of government into affairs of churches per Supreme Court decisions. Tax exemption respects that barrier. The fact that it is consistent with the intent of the Founders is evidenced by the fact the tax exemptions for religious groups \(from excise taxes\) have existed since the first Congress.
1.7.13.1. Con: Financial legislation at America's inception should be open to change with the society around it.
1.7.13.2. Con: "Excessive entanglement" is the last factor in the 3 pronged [Lemon Test](https://www.usconstitution.net/lemon.html) SCOTUS uses to assess Establishment Clause cases. The law under scrutiny must also "have a secular legislative purpose," and its primary effect can "neither advance nor inhibit religion". It's hard to see a secular purpose in religious tax exemptions, and it's harder to see how they don't primarily advance religion.
1.7.13.3. Con: Taxation is compatible with freedom of religion in the same way that taxing the profits of newspapers or publishers does not constitute an infringement of free speech.
1.7.14. Con: Having the exemption has the notable negative side effect of [encouraging businesses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1xJAVZxXg) to claim to be religions so they can be tax exempt.
1.7.15. Pro: Taxing an institution requires that the government closely monitor and record its financial activities. The government should not inspect religious institutions this closely.
1.7.15.1. Con: Religious institutions' financial activities should be as closely monitored as those of any other organization. The government has a duty to be equitable \(as well as various other duties\).
1.7.15.2. Pro: Taxing churches would mean that the government would have to periodically audit churches and declare what and what isn't a legitimate "religious act." This raises a constitutional question as Congress cannot pass laws affecting the free exercise of religion.
1.7.16. Con: Saying that not paying taxes avoids governments involvement in religions, i.e. control, does not hold, because than companies should not have to pay taxes either, since we don't want governments to intervene in companies either.
1.7.17. Con: This clearly applies to the US and a few others. But taxing a religious organisation is not in any way passing a law that prohibits or undermines the free exercise of religion, or religious establishments. The US constitution in the very same section also protects freedom of speech, it is however not legal to lie in adverts or scream 'bomb' in a subway for no reason. Plus even if valid, all this objection does is suggest a rewrite of existing outdated legislation.
1.7.18. Con: Tax exemptions for religious organizations are an explicit \(and illicit\) agreement between them and the government, in violation of the separation clause.
1.8. Pro: Tax exemptions are a privilege and should not automatically be granted to any organisation, including churches.
1.8.1. Con: Being tax exempt comes together with huge disadvantages. When a church accepts the 501\(c\)\(3\) status, that church waives its constitutionally guaranteed rights: freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right to influence legislators and the legislation they craft. It is no longer free to speak to the vital issues of the day. It becomes controlled by a spirit of fear that if it doesn’t toe the line with the IRS it will lose its tax-exempt status.
1.8.2. Con: Churches do not need to be granted automatic, blanket tax exemptions. They could instead be granted automatic exemptions from specific types of taxes.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Churches and all non-profits do not make profits to pay corporation tax on and do not pay dividends to shareholders. In the UK at least, the tax exemptions they benefit from are purchase tax \(known here as VAT\) and reimbursement of income tax on personal donations \(known here as Gift Aid\), and to qualify any charity needs to demonstrate its \(non-spiritual\) benefit to society. This seems perfectly reasonable.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Nonprofits should lose their exemption from property taxes but still be exempt from income taxes.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: Property taxes pay for numerous community services which are used by churches. The community is forced to subsidize the church by paying for those services.
1.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: Property taxes pay for: police officers, firefighters, snow plowing, trash collection, and local schools.
1.8.2.2.1.2. Con: Churches provide numerous community services such as day care, mental and emotional support, meals, clothes and shelter to the needy, disaster relief, for free thanks to tax relief that allows them to financially survive.
1.8.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Some churches provide aid to the community, but if churches paid their property taxes, all of the other land owning economic participants would have more of their own money to spend. They could contribute to the charities of their choosing.
1.8.2.2.1.2.2. Con: The free exercise of religion is an individual right; every citizen has it in equal measure. Property owning citizens may disapprove of one or more religions in their community. Free exercise should include the right of citizens to choose for themselves which, if any, religions to support.
1.8.2.2.2. Pro: Retaining the exemption on Church income still gives the organization the full benefit of donations.
1.8.3. Con: Tax exemptions are not a privilege in case of churches because historically churches were [receiving taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe), rather than paying them. Not receiving taxes is already a disadvantage in comparison to this.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.
1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.8.6. Pro: They should be taxed at a rate that is based on how they physically support a community or demographic. There are a lot of churches that lock their doors when they are not preaching.
1.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.
1.8.8. Con: The power to tax is also the power to regulate. Without an automatic exemption, the government could use the tax law to favor religions it likes and disfavor religions it does not like, or discriminate against smaller, less mainstream churches and religions.
1.8.8.1. Con: The state, however, must determine what is a religion and what is not in order to 'exempt' from taxation. The state always has the power to tax and exemptions are extensions of that power.
1.8.8.2. Con: In the US, such a variable tax scheme would be unconstitutional. The Bill of Rights applies to the States via the 14th Amendment. Whatever tax method is ultimately decided upon, it must be applied to every house of worship uniformly.
1.8.8.3. Con: Giving a tax exemption is a form of regulation. It places the religion in a privileged position financially and disadvantages those organisations that pay tax.
1.8.8.4. Pro: The US Supreme Court [ruled](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/17/316/case.html) in McCulloch v. Maryland \(1819\) that "the power to tax involves the power to destroy".
1.8.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.1.1.
1.8.9. Pro: Our tax code is way too complex with too many deductions and exclusions. We should all pay our fair share based mainly on income. Most charities are specialized and do not benefit the general public. Reign in tax exemptions for most institutions. The Red Cross, for example, benefits everyone.
1.8.10. Pro: Exemption from a law, regardless of the law or who is granted the exemption, creates a second class of citizen \([bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-15/the-gun-law-loophole-that-entices-tycoons-and-criminals-to-play-c), [npr.org](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/06/04/616724965/giuliani-president-trump-has-constitutional-authority-to-pardon-himself)\) and degrades democracy.
1.8.10.1. Con: Every citizen has equal opportunity to join tax-exempt churches or other non-profit organizations.
1.8.11. Pro: It is too [easy to create](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Perpetual_Exemption) new religions \(churches\) just to benefit from tax exemptions - for example, making yourself the leader of the new religion and making your salary tax exempt.
1.8.11.1. Con: It is equally easy to start a non-profit organization to claim tax-exempt benefits.
1.8.11.2. Con: The relative ease should not create a backlash making it more difficult for good minded people to start organizations that have a clear goal and benefit to society.
1.8.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.
1.8.13. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.
1.8.14. Pro: There can be a happy medium. If churches and religious organizations were required to file and show their expenses then the charitable activities and religious activities would be exempt. Large salaries and distributions to leadership would be subject to taxation. The point is most objections to tax exemptions is when preachers and others are living the grandiose lifestyle with charitable donations.
1.8.14.1. Pro: Prior to the social media revolution, religion, newspapers and radio were the main source of information and assistance. People are now more educated and aware. Religious organisations are under more scrutiny and also less socially relevant. We should have tax concessions for actual bonefied charity work but administration and other expenses should be treated like any other business.
1.8.15. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.16.
1.8.16. Pro: It is not unfair to ask any religious entity desiring tax exemptions to go through the same process a non-religious entity desiring the same tax exemption goes through.
1.8.17. Pro: By giving tax exemptions to churches on a case-by-case basis rather than automatically, the state can incentivise churches to engage in socially productive behaviour.
1.8.17.1. Pro: The state could grant tax exemptions to churches proportionately to how much charity work they do.
1.8.17.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.17.3.1.1.
1.8.17.3. Pro: On its own, promotion of a religion is not necessarily good. Not every religion espouses goodwill, equally, toward all. Tax-free status should be reserved for organisations who work to enhance or improve peoples' lives, not simply promote a set of beliefs.
1.8.17.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.2.1.
1.8.17.3.2. Con: Denying tax exemptions to organisations simply because they do not espouse universal goodwill is an unconscionable infringement of freedom of speech.
1.8.17.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.17.3.6.
1.8.17.3.2.2. Con: "Tax exempt" isn't a necessary status for speech to be free.
1.8.17.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.
1.8.17.4. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.
1.8.18. Pro: Churches should exist legally as non-profit charities and be expected to maintain the same documentation. This would prevent abusive money making schemes and tax evasion such as scientology and mega churches from wealth building without income tax and property tax.
1.9. Con: The loss of existing tax exemptions will place a substantial financial burden on religious organisations.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.
1.9.2. Con: Every institution loses a degree of stability when they pay bills including taxes. The question is not about financial viability, it's whether or not the exemption is fair.
1.9.3. Con: If a church struggles to stay open with the burden of taxes, then it's membership does not value the services it provides enough to fully fund it.
1.9.3.1. Con: Financial contributions do not equal faith and/or value in an institution. People with less means do not necessarily place less value in religion just because they do not have the means to support their places of worship.
1.9.3.1.1. Pro: The worlds poorest nations have some of the [highest rates](http://news.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx) of religiosity.
1.9.3.2. Pro: A terrific test of faith would be to see how long religion lasts while being taxed. Watch church numbers plummet while you see them scramble to adjust to society's new standards for them. If religion is truly valued by society let it demonstrate itself to be through taxes.
1.9.3.2.1. Con: Tax is not a reliable or regular mechanism for measuring 'value to society'. Many non-religious institutions and some individuals pay little or no tax and still add value to society. Social impact, or the development of social capital, is an emerging field and is difficult to measure.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.4.1.
1.9.5. Con: Religion exists in a multitude of forms across the planet, many without formal structures. The revelations across the globe surrounding abuse of power within formal religion organisations suggests an erosion of fiscal surety could benefit both worshippers and religions by decentralising power and returning faith to an exclusively spiritual practice, unconcerned with fundraising, capital accumulation and the resulting power these bring.
1.9.5.1. Con: Decentralized religion comes along with less oversight and less accountability over local practices.
1.9.5.1.1. Con: The only relevant oversight and accountability systems for unorganised religion are the views and judgements of god\(s\); alongside the strength or meaning of faith to the practitioners themselves. If religious individuals commit civic crimes or felonies, they still are accountable to the state. Meanwhile, institutions, especially those as monied as organised religion, are much more able to avoid litigation and censure - due in large part to both resources and obfuscating structures.
1.9.5.1.1.1. Con: There are problematic ethical behaviors short of criminal offenses that church leaders have the ability and responsibility to address.
1.9.5.1.1.2. Con: Personal conviction and law provide little oversight.
1.9.5.1.2. Pro: The public is better able to apply pressure to large, visible, religious organizations in order to effect change.
1.9.5.1.3. Pro: Large religions mean that central, likely more moderate religious authorities, can check extremist groups within the religion.
1.9.5.1.3.1. Pro: Central church authorities are likely to be more moderate because they most likely will require consensus from a large cross section of the religion.
1.9.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: The [Papal Conclave](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-21412589) ensures that whoever is elected pope has to gain a consensus \(or at least a 2/3 majority\) of the Cardinals, who are representative of most of the Catholic world.
1.9.5.1.3.2. Con: This conversely means that outdated practices are cemented in structured Church bureaucracy.
1.9.5.1.4. Pro: Large religions tend to have quality control mechanisms that ensure that all churches are operating under best practices.
1.9.5.1.4.1. Pro: Variants of [Ecclesiastical Courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_court#Orthodox_churches) are found across a variety of Christian faiths in order to ensure that local churches operate in ethical practices under church law.
1.9.5.1.4.1.1. Con: The Catholic Church has been [heavily criticized](https://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/articles.cfm?id=733) for not enforcing its own law.
1.9.5.2. Pro: Large centralized religious institutions, like the Catholic Church, are more able to cover up scandals and problematic behavior than more decentralized groups through a wide variety of mechanisms afforded to them by their large networks and bureaucratic capability.
1.9.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.4.2.2.
1.9.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.4.2.3.
1.9.5.2.3. Pro: Large Church figures are able to use their large platforms and political capital to silence and shame whistleblowers.
1.9.5.2.3.1. Pro: Pope Francis has used his platform to [accuse accusers](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/01/19/pope-francis-accuses-victims-of-notorious-pedophile-of-slander) of slander.
1.9.5.3. Con: Decentralized religion makes it harder for churches to spread their message.
1.9.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.9.6. Con: Worshiping can be practiced with small groups in [public spaces](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2007/rpt/2007-R-0353.htm) if need be. This incurs little cost to the worshippers.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Religious communities can function perfectly well without institutional support. [Early Christian communities](https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/go-ye-all-world-messages-new-testament-apostles/setting-and-sacrament-christian-community) often met in the homes of adherents and lacked a formal church.
1.9.6.2. Con: The same could be said regarding the functions of state. Perhaps the Mayor could hold council in his home, easing the burden on tax payers which would be expended in building and maintaining a city hall, yet we do not demand this of them.
1.9.6.3. Con: An essential element of most religions across history has been erecting monuments, shrines, and other edifices to honor the divine.  This freedom is guaranteed in the Constitution.
1.9.6.4. Pro: While churches are a solid structure to bring people of a faith together, other buildings could be used as a religious community center.
1.9.7. Pro: Churches who suffer from a lack of funds are vulnerable to influence by wealthy special interests.
1.9.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.1.1.2.
1.9.8. Con: Churches would only be taxed to the extent that they turn a profit. Since most churches are "non-profit" organizations, a change in tax status would likely have no effect on a church's bottom line.
1.9.9. Pro: Religious organizations with large property holdings of historically important buildings and their land should be exempt from land taxes as they are generally unable to sell them or otherwise use them profitably.
1.9.9.1. Pro: Quite [a number](http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/churchbuildings/churchbuildings.htm) of British churches are Grade 2 listed, and some are even Grade 1. Introducing a tax on churches would mean less money to maintain the fabric of the building.
1.9.9.2. Con: Buildings of historical importance can be also operated as museums and earn an income from visitors who are not there for the religious services.
1.9.9.2.1. Con: Most museums are not profitable. Even MOMA in New York is [losing money](http://nymag.com/news/features/2007/profit/32904/) on every admission \(due to security and utility costs\), despite a $20 ticket price.
1.9.10. Pro: Many Churches depend on member donations to do their work, and taxing them would be indirectly taxing those charitable donations.
1.9.10.1. Pro: If churches needed to pay taxes, they would need more income to pay these. This can result in churches pressuring people to donate or even making it a rule that you have to pay to get into the church.
1.9.10.1.1. Con: They would pay taxes only based on their profits, i.e. the donation revenue in excess of their expenditure. As a result, if they did not collect a lot of money that year, they would also pay less tax. So there is no way taxes would require churches to make followers donate more. The only reason they would need to do that is so that they could have more capital to spend.
1.9.10.1.2. Pro: Members of the church would no longer receive a tax exempt status of their donation and would limit the incentive for further financial gifts to organized religion.  Therefore, removing tax exempt status of religious organizations would also increase tax on faithful members of the churches.
1.10. Pro: Giving churches an automatic tax break could be viewed as the state supporting religion, which is inappropriate.
1.10.1. Pro: A religious tax exemption makes the state an arbiter over which religions are legitimate enough to deserve a non taxable status.
1.10.1.1. Pro: The automatic tax exemption forces the state to determine what constitutes a church and what doesn't, thereby putting the state in a position to determine appropriate and innapropriate religions. The state cannot make such a choice without promoting some religious ideas over others.
1.10.1.2. Con: Tax exempt status is granted because an organization does not operate for profit like a business does, not because the government is endorsing their views. [282,641 organizations](https://nccs-data.urban.org/dd2.php?close=1&form=BMF+08/2016) are registered in the US under 501\(c\)\(3\) "Religion Related, Spiritual Development" \(NTEE X\) covering the full spectrum of religious belief. 501\(c\)\(3\) status is open to any religious organization \(Christian, Muslim, Jewish, the church of Satan etc.\) thus the state is not treating one group preferentially.
1.10.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.1.
1.10.1.3. Pro: A long-running benefit, like a tax exemption, provides leverage for state control of religion. The benefit becomes part of the due course and retraction of the benefit becomes a viable threat.
1.10.1.4. Pro: Because religion exists primarily in the human mind and usually includes a significant element of faith, there is virtually no way for the state to prove or disprove someone's religious convictions. This fact puts the state in an impossible position where it will almost always need to take the believer's word for it, or be faced with an equally impossible court battle.
1.10.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.
1.10.1.6. Con: Each state has the right to decide what it recognises as a religion and if religious organisation warrant tax exemption.
1.10.1.7. Con: Since most real religions would be granted a legitimate status by the state, this would make no difference to the types of religious freedom which are important - that is, the religious freedoms of genuine believers.
1.10.1.7.1. Con: Whether a religion qualifies as "real" can be difficult to establish, subjecting some religious denominations to biased definition requirements they can't fulfil.
1.10.1.7.2. Con: The Church of the IV Majesties, a Satanist group in Oklahoma, was [granted](https://abcnews.go.com/US/satanist-church-rents-oklahoma-civic-center-exorcism-ritual/story?id=11524098) tax exempt status in 2010.
1.10.2. Con: Taxing churches creates a financial incentive for the government to promote church attendance.
1.10.3. Pro: By giving only religions a tax exemption the government is subsidizing religion over atheism.
1.10.3.1. Con: Churches are not the only organisations that are tax exempt.
1.10.3.1.1. Con: This is a version of the [bandwagon fallacy](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-bandwagon-fallacy-1689158).
1.10.3.2. Pro: There is nothing wrong in paying for services you are using, because they are not free anyway. Forcing non-believers to pay \(with taxes\) for believers' services is not fair. If there are not enough believers to support so many churches, then we need fewer churches.
1.10.3.3. Con: If atheists had a "church" like association, it wouldn't be taxed.
1.10.3.3.1. Pro: There are [organisations whose fundamental mission is to espouse atheism](https://ffrf.org/), which currently enjoy tax exempt status in the United States.
1.10.3.3.2. Con: Atheist organizations aren't given an automatic tax exempt status. They are just another organization gathered solely around spreading a \(dis\)belief system. It's unfair their competition gets a financial advantage.
1.10.4. Pro: A laic state should not favor religious organisations.
1.10.5. Con: The assumption of the statement, that taxation is the neutral starting point and tax-exemption therefore shows bias, is false. The default state of humanity is to be free from tax. All taxes are deliberately created by given societies. Thus to be free from tax is the neutral starting point and it is adding a tax which would show bias.
1.10.6. Con: Taxation isn't a given starting point. There is a big difference between "giving" and "not taking". The burden of justified action falls on the one initiating the action. In this case, people want to use the government to take money from churches. When framed this way, this violates separation of church and state. The question would then be whether the government has authority to cross this boundary.
1.10.6.1. Con: The assertion that not paying tax is the default state, and that applying taxation is secondary, is false. The basic state of government \(regarding taxation\) is that everyone pays tax, except for entities that are exempt \(for many reasons\).
1.10.7. Con: Most churches would qualify as charitable institutions anyway even if they weren't granted a specific tax exemption as a religious organization.
1.10.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.7.
1.10.7.2. Pro: During natural disasters, churches and religious organizations often open their doors to assist those in need, often in coordination with civil authorities.
1.10.7.2.1. Pro: If a church is capable of assisting in the time of emergency and fails to do so, it often creates a [scandal](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joel-osteen-lakewood-church-hurricane-harvey_us_59a45aa4e4b0821444c513d8), as people expect churches to assist in times of need.
1.10.7.2.2. Con: Wealthy churches have often [failed](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/hurricane-harvey-texas-lakewood-church-shut-flooding-mosques-open-a7917521.html) to open their doors to those in need during natural disasters.
1.10.7.3. Pro: According to some estimates, over [25% of health care facilities](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic_hospitals_represent_26_percent_of_worlds_health_facilities_reports_pontifical_council) worldwide are operated by religious organizations.
1.10.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.10.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.16.2.2.1.1.1.1.7.
1.10.8. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.12.
1.10.9. Con: Misinformation is often a reason people think religions should be taxed. Truly, religions already pay some taxes \(employee income, sales and VAT, etc.\). When we take into account what religions actually do give to the government, they are not as tax-exempt as people often seem to think.
1.10.9.1. Con: There is a difference between a religion and a church.  Churches are institutions, religions are concepts.  If a church engages in activity that is taxable to every other institution, there needs to be a very good reason why they should not be subject to the same tax.
1.10.10. Pro: Each tax payer has an obligation to support the society through taxes. Any deductions means that others must pay more to make up for the loss, resulting in all tax payers being forced to support the religious organisation in question.
1.10.10.1. Con: Tax is not based off an amount the government needs, but the amount an individual receives.
1.10.10.2. Con: Taxes support the government. Equating such contributions as contributions to society makes the fallacy that government equals society and such simply is not true. The government may be an element in society but it is not equal to it. Equating loss of government revenues as a hurt to society also makes the same mistake. Revenues gathered by the government does not equal an automatic benefit to society.
1.10.11. Con: There is no constitutional protection for atheism. Asserting that tax exempt status for religious organizations equates to government sponsorship of a particular religion is simply false. Neither does it support the assertion that the Government is advocating belief in religion over atheism.  More than a few atheistic not-profits also benefit from the same law.
1.10.11.1. Con: If atheism is a religion in itself then providing tax benefits to all religions except it is government discrimination.
1.10.11.2. Pro: Atheism is [not](https://www.atheists.org/activism/resources/about-atheism/) a religion.
1.10.11.2.1. Con: While true, it is irrelevant. The free exercise of religion includes the right to abstain.
1.10.11.3. Con: ["The Religion Clauses, as a result, protect adherents of all religions, as well as those who believe in no religion at all."](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/844/#)
1.10.11.4. Con: Constitutional protection for atheism falls under free speech. Atheism is simply the absence of belief based on lack of evidence. It's not a belief in anything. It's a non-belief. Not the same thing as religion. For example, of the approximate ~1400 recognized deities, Christians are 'atheistic' of 1399.
1.10.12. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.10.13. Con: Separation of church and state is meant to prevent the government from supporting a particular religious institution and persecuting others \(as was common in Europe historically\). The mere support for religious institutions in general is not inappropriate.
1.10.13.1. Pro: While there are many who believe the proverbial "wall" between church and state should be absolute, the claim accurately states how the Supreme Court has interpreted the Establishment Clause. See "Everson v. Board of Education" at [billofrightsinstitute.org](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/cases/)
1.10.13.2. Con: If an atheist were denied a job because he were not religious, this would be legitimate by this argument because no particular religion was supported or denied. The Establishment Clause provides for state support of no religion, and this includes tax favoritism and is intended to protect the religious and the non-religious equally.
1.10.14. Pro: Economies should be self-regulating. Giving tax breaks works in a similar way to prolonged terminal care that artificially extends life but doesn't improve quality of life: by preventing natural life cycle and death, we're creating zombies who are taking space and resources from other organizations.
1.10.14.1. Con: The mere fact that something is failing economically speaking does not mean that it is not required or beneficial to society. Positive externalities that are hard to quantify in economic terms, such as increased [general happiness](http://www.smf.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Social-Market-Foundation-Publication-Briefing-CAGE-4-Are-happy-workers-more-productive-281015.pdf#page=9), may prove to be [worth more](https://hbr.org/2011/06/the-happiness-dividend) than the space and resources dedicated to keeping those "zombies" alive.
1.10.14.1.1. Con: Whatever positive externalities there may be, the negative externalities will be greater. Every dollar spent on delaying death where quality of life is zero or de minimis, is a dollar not spent on improving the quality of life that could yet be vibrant and fulfilling. It is unfathomable that sacrificing the well-being of the living in order to prolong the lives of the near dead, would cause greater net happiness in society.
1.10.14.2. Con: "Economies should be self-regulating" is the basis of neoliberalism. It is an economic ideology, and should not be taken as gospel truth. As a matter of fact, the benefits of neoliberalism are [highly debated](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/31/witnessing-death-neoliberalism-imf-economists).
1.10.14.3. Con: This assumes that the lives of people on terminal care have no value. This is not the case.
1.10.14.3.1. Con: Valuations are still there, but they are relative valuations. No system anywhere has unlimited resources. Say it costs $50,000/wk to keep a 90 year old on life support, he is in a terminal coma, and the family is just waiting for the end. If it also costs $50,000 to correct a birth defect that prevents the ability to walk, and would allow a child to have a normal life, the money seems better spent on the child. In fact, the old man's family would probably agree.
1.10.14.3.1.1. Con: It is easy to find extreme examples. However, life does not always present us with such easy choices. Let us consider the opposite for instance: the one on terminal care is the child. Terminal care can add a few years to the child, or the resources could go to furthering the life of an able 90 year-old. This makes it hard to say terminal care is a waste of resources in that case.
1.10.14.4. Con: The government should never have the power to determine that it is time for someone to die because their care has become expensive.
1.10.14.5. Pro: This money could be used by the government to provide services, which would benefit all people in society rather than just those who are religious.
1.10.14.5.1. Con: The government misallocates funding to the point of programs not getting funded. Churches put it where it is needed, and - at least for some churches - you do not have to be religious to get help with food, clothing and housing.
1.10.14.5.1.1. Con: If the government misallocates funds, the remedy should be to correct it, not allow it to persist and expect private organizations to pick up the slack.
1.10.14.5.1.2. Con: "Churches put it where it is needed": Churches decide where it is needed. If the government collected the revenue, the people as a whole could decide where and what is needed. It is more democratic to let the people decide, rather than various private, uncoordinated and unelected enclaves.
1.10.14.5.1.3. Pro: Church-provided social services already benefit more than just religious people - a [high proportion](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865672372/Homeless-find-rest-in-faith-based-shelters-more-than-others.html) of beds for homeless people in the US, for example, are provided by religious organisations, with no questions asked as to the recipient's religion.
1.10.14.5.2. Pro: This would lessen the [massive](https://www.thebalance.com/the-u-s-debt-and-how-it-got-so-big-3305778) debt caused by social welfare programs in countries like the US.
1.10.14.5.2.1. Con: Social welfare programs, like [social security,](https://www.thebalance.com/the-u-s-debt-and-how-it-got-so-big-3305778) tend to run at a surplus meaning much of the US debt is owed to these programs as opposed to because of these programs.
1.10.15. Pro: The government misses out on a great deal of revenue by giving churches a tax break, which many non-religious people may see as unfair.
1.10.15.1. Con: Taxing churches is to tax people based on their religious beliefs, since it would affect church members only and non-religious people would not be affected.
1.10.15.2. Pro: "Combined, federal tax breaks on donations to churches and exemptions from state and local property taxes likely add up to something on the order of [$25 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-churches-irs/as-churches-get-political-irs-stays-quiet-idUSBRE85K1EP20120621) in lost revenue each year."
1.10.15.2.1. Pro: Churches in the US own $300-$500 billion in [untaxed property](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-schweitzer/robert-jeffress-romney_b_1002753.html).
1.10.15.2.1.1. Con: Property that is necessary for the carrying out of charitable activities, for example in the form of hosting soup kitchens, should not be taxable.
1.10.15.3. Pro: Paying taxes is seen as a social responsibility.
1.10.15.4. Con: The charitable work that churches do saves the government money. If churches have fewer resources because of losing their tax-exempt status, the government will have to spend more money to replace the services they will no longer be able to provide.
1.10.15.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.
1.10.15.4.2. Con: Funds that provide social services should not be taxed, but the huge amount of property owned should be.
1.10.15.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.10.15.2.1.1.
1.10.15.4.3. Con: Charitable services can be delivered equally effectively by secular organisations, if not more so because time, money and effort isn't spent proselytising.
1.10.15.5. Con: Taxing for the sake of taxing is rent-seeking behavior from feudalism. We don't simply charge churches for existing.
1.10.15.6. Pro: If the "parsonage exemption" on religious ministers' housing costs were revoked, the government would gain an [estimated](https://churchesandtaxes.procon.org/sourcefiles/the-parsonage-exemption-violates-the-establishment-clause-and-should-be-declared-unconstitutional.pdf) $2.3 billion over five years from clergy members.
1.10.15.7. Pro: New York is [losing out](https://nypost.com/2011/07/16/new-york-citys-losing-13-5b-in-property-tax-breaks/) on $627 million annually in property tax on religious institutions.
1.10.15.8. Pro: The specific point of taxes is to provide a wider social good, without the need for adherence to a particular religion or ideology.
1.10.15.8.1. Con: It's not just about money, people donate their labour to the church, volunteer to run events and charity drives, if they weren't there doing the work freely the government would have to pay people an award wage to do the same work. So while you may reject church charity as a conversion technique the people who donate and volunteer see it as a worthy cause, otherwise they wouldn't do it.
1.10.15.9. Con: The idea that giving churches a tax break is "the State supporting religion" is based on the spurious idea that taxation is a [natural state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature#Thomas_Hobbes) and not a positive law. On the contrary, the State does not have a 'right' to this income for it to "miss out on." In fact, taxation of churches is an obvious infringement on the free exercise of religion.
1.10.15.9.1. Con: "Free exercise of religion" does not give the church the right to ignore generally applicable laws. The prohibition on murder is not a "natural state," yet churches may not engage in human sacrifice. Conversely, under this argument, a church would not be entitled to police protection from criminal offenses either, because such police protection also would not be a part of the "natural state."
1.10.15.9.2. Con: This argument implies that all taxation, deviating as it does from the state of nature, is illegitimate. Taxation serves the public good by providing for collective security and welfare. Churches, like all in society who benefit from such collective goods, must contribute their fair share.
1.10.15.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.2.
1.10.15.9.2.2. Con: Physical security is a private good, not a public "collective" good.
1.10.15.10. Con: Religious tax exemptions are not unfair. Secular organisations which carry out the same kind of functions as churches - for example, by doing [charitable work](http://nationalhomeless.org/about-us/), or espousing a [certain ethical philosophy](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/), are entitled to the same tax exemptions as churches.
1.10.15.11. Pro: -> See 1.10.14.5.
1.11. Pro: Churches often pursue private rather than public goals, and therefore should not be given a tax exemption on the basis of being a charitable organisation.
1.11.1. Con: Churches provide a social benefit to society, like charities do, and therefore deserve to maintain their tax-exempt status.
1.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.7.
1.11.1.2. Con: If church is doing charity work, then it works in two fields at the same time. It should be split and only the charity part treated as charity.
1.11.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.16.2.2.1.1.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.17.3.
1.11.3. Pro: At a minimum, religious organizations should be subject to IRS audits. A special provision within the federal tax code exempts churches from tax inquiries: [irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/26usc7611.pdf) . This special church-only provision invites fraud disguised as religion.
1.11.4. Con: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.
1.11.5. Pro: Religion at its core is a philosophy; providing tax exemption to religious organisations is like providing tax exemption to vegans and conspiracy theorists. Providing tax exemptions to vegans would actually be more logical.
1.11.5.1. Con: It is true that secular organisations which advocate a specific moral philosophy are just as worthy of having a tax exemption as churches are. [Vegan organisations](https://www.vegan.com/nonprofits/), for example, can and do enjoy tax-exempt non-profit status.
1.11.5.2. Pro: Most religions are predicated on faith in the existence of god. Whether [god exists](https://www.kialo.com/the-existence-of-god-2629/2629.0=2629.1/=2629.1) is a contested question.
1.11.6. Con: Churches pursue both private and public goals as do all non-profits. Though the church's non-profit mission is sometimes not viewed by others as valid, nonetheless the mission is the final purpose of the organization and not profit.
1.11.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.14.1.1.1.
1.11.7. Con: All benefits are necessarily public benefits, since every citizen is a member of the public. If the private benefits that churches provide are large enough, and if funding churches is essential to their provision of those private benefits, then the state should still fund churches.
1.11.8. Pro: Churches pay no property taxes.  As a result, they should be required to be accessible to all taxpayers, not just church members. For example the Mormon temple in Los Angeles pays no taxes and yet sits on [valuable land](http://www.boe.ca.gov/proptaxes/pdf/pub48.pdf). The general public [is not allowed](https://www.google.com/amp/s/la.curbed.com/platform/amp/2012/11/6/10309386/8-things-found-at-the-visitors-center-of-westwoods-offlimits-mormon) in or on most of the buildings on that compound.
1.11.9. Con: Non-profits have a variety of public and private goals without the law defining a percentage of how much can be designated to public or private concerns. Removing tax exempt status due to focusing on favoring public needs over the private would change a significant amount of non-profits missions outside of religious organizations.
1.12. Con: It would be unconscionable to tax religious organizations, which operate as a structure onto which religious beliefs are formalized. To tax them is akin to taxing those beliefs. Since these beliefs also do not produce anything material, it is also akin to taxing the “immaterial realm”.
1.12.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.20.1.
1.12.2. Con: If taxing them was akin to 'taxing belief' then paying money to them would be akin to buying belief and receiving money would be selling belief.
1.12.3. Con: -> See 1.9.6.
1.12.4. Con: A "material" structure in support of the "immaterial realm" is a contradiction. If the beliefs need to interact with the real world, they must do so without special exemptions.
1.12.4.1. Con: The material structures of the real world which enable one’s mind to even exist in a state of conscious being, are that which foments thought and belief, which aren’t meant material in nature but rather advisory. Not only that, but religion is a fundamental structure of human civilization, it pays taxes through teaching people to act “well” in the material world. Taxing it would be to tax it twice, essentially.
1.12.4.1.1. Con: Even if we assume teaching people to act “well” means performing a public good broadly, it doesn’t follow that that service is a tax. The claim of double-taxing feels like a stretch. Other fundamental structures of civilization, for example, businesses, contribute to economic well-being \(a measurable public benefit\) and we expect them to pay taxes.
1.12.5. Pro: The ability to form and operate churches is fundamental to many religious traditions. In Christianity, for example, strong emphasis is placed upon the building of a [Christian community](https://readingacts.com/2018/03/14/an-ideal-christian-community-1-peter-38-12/). Erecting a barrier to the formation of such a community by taxing churches infringes freedom of religion.
1.12.5.1. Con: The ability to own a home is, for many, fundamental to the American dream. Home ownership has those barriers, and people spend more time in homes than in churches.
1.12.5.2. Con: The ability to form and operate businesses is also important for any community, and businesses do pay taxes.
1.12.5.3. Con: The ability to perform human sacrifices is fundamental to some religious traditions, but we don't grant the privilege of human sacrifices to religious organizations.
1.12.5.4. Con: Taxing churches is not an impediment to the building of religious communities. Granting tax exemption to churches is an enticement to create such communities; but they can easily be formed without being exempt from taxation.
1.12.5.4.1. Pro: Churches don't need money to operate. Paid clergy and large, expensive buildings are not necessary for worship, and the overall non-monetary nature of worship itself means that only monetized religions would experience such a barrier.
1.12.6. Con: If taxation is the mechanism of supporting the larger societal fabric in which the individual/organization exists, then any entity benefiting from it should be inclined to pay taxes. Additionally the immaterial value of churches require a material base to establish a practice. Seeing as churches benefit inherently from the government enforcing individual right to religion, it's only sensible that church contribute back to the government in form of taxes and maintain its material foundation.
1.12.6.1. Con: Taxation as a benefit to society when compared with active involvement in the lives of the disadvantaged is proved to be bankrupt in every case [examined](https://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-American-Compassion-Marvin-Olasky/dp/089526725X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1529175886&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Tragedy+of+American+Charity).
1.12.6.2. Pro: When a religious organization profits from real estate and other investments, it disavows its status as a charity.
1.12.7. Con: Taxing a church does not tax its beliefs. It requires them to pay a portion of their income to help support the nation in which they operate, like any other business. The only difference between a church and another business is that the FTC has yet to fine a church for false advertising, although they can't prove their product exists.
1.12.7.1. Con: Giving money to a church is not a business transaction.
1.12.7.1.1. Con: Pure "donations" to a church aren't necessarily business related, but religious institutions generate untaxed income in other quantifiable ways, such as faith-based schooling tuition and church endorsements for external fundraising events.
1.12.7.1.2. Con: Inheriting something from a relative is not a business transaction either, yet many governments have an inheritance tax.
1.12.8. Con: Taxing the churches is not a tax on belief, that is metaphysically absurd. The tax is upon an asset belonging to the church, its property or its income. The parishioners would have to pay that as part of their support for their church. This would be no different than the taxes paid by a home owners association. When you have "pastors" demanding their flock buy them private planes, it is time to tax the churches.
1.12.8.1. Con: This approach would require great care and nuance.
1.12.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.4.1.
1.12.9. Con: Churches are subject to a number of taxes already, such as employment tax and gas tax.
1.13. Pro: Churches are often politically active and thus don't deserve tax-exempt status accorded to non-politically active non-profits.
1.13.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.
1.13.2. Con: The First Amendment provides that the government will not interfere with religion. It does not mean that religion has its voice muted or cannot act on political issues. It does limit religious organization freedom prohibiting a theocracy as that would infringe on other faiths. Undoing this First Amendment principle steals away religious protection, erodes individual protection and moves us towards a corporate ruling government of the majority and no check and balance for the minority.
1.13.3. Pro: Church officials often use their position to engage in electioneering, [despite an explicit ban](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-churches-irs/as-churches-get-political-irs-stays-quiet-idUSBRE85K1EP20120621) on charities by the IRS.
1.13.3.1. Pro: The new US tax bill functionally turns Churches into "[Dark Money](https://bulletin.represent.us/tax-bill-turns-churches-dark-money-super-pacs/)" SuperPACs.
1.13.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.11.5.
1.13.3.3. Pro: Under the [Internal Revenue Code](http://www.irs.gov), all section 501\(c\)\(3\) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of \(or in opposition to\) any candidate for elective public office.
1.13.3.3.1. Con: But there is no reason the IRS should have this power that is clearly not granted to them by the US Constitution.
1.13.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.17.3.3.
1.13.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.17.3.4.
1.13.3.6. Con: Since the ban was put into law in 1954, the IRS has successfully revoked the tax-exempt status from only [one church](https://churchesandtaxes.procon.org/sourcefiles/ignore-the-rumors-campaigning-from-the-pulpit-is-okay-thinking-past-the-symbolism-of-section-501c3.pdf) - the Church at Pierce Creek in Binghamton, NY, for a newspaper advertisement against Bill Clinton in the run-up to the 1992 presidential election.
1.13.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.17.3.5.
1.13.3.8. Con: A [501\(h\) election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501\(h\)_election) \(Conable election\) is a procedure that allows charitable organisations in the US to lawfully conduct lobbying activities as long as their financial expenditure does not exceed a specified amount.
1.13.3.9. Con: Issue advocacy is [permissible](https://scholar.utc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1074&context=honors-theses) under IRS rules as long as the organization in question \(1\) does not spend a substantial amount of its time engaged in advocacy activities, and \(2\) the advocacy activities do not evolve into support for or opposition of a particular political candidate or party.
1.13.3.9.1. Pro: An [executive order](https://churchesandtaxes.procon.org/sourcefiles/Trump-Executive-Order-Promoting-Free-Speech-Religious-Liberty.pdf) signed by President Trump in 2017 "directs the IRS not to unfairly target churches and religious organizations for political speech". In practice, it effectively [maintains the status quo](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/04/president-trumps-religious-order-could-unleash-political-money/101289500/) that "churches can speak out on political issues as long as they don't endorse or oppose a specific candidate".
1.13.3.10. Con: Church leaders [may make political comments](https://scholar.utc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1074&context=honors-theses) if they clearly state that the comments are their personal views and do not represent the organization’s views.
1.13.3.10.1. Con: Church leaders are highly influential figures within a community who obviously base their personal views off doctrine and religious values. Their personal views still have a huge impact on their flocks.
1.13.3.11. Pro: The Salvation Army is known for engaging in political campaigns, including a number of [Anti-LGBT](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/zinnia-jones/the-salvation-armys-histo_b_4422938.html) crusades.
1.13.4. Pro: Churches shouldn't be exempt from paying taxes because many of their leaders are involved in politics, social networks, and/or private work.
1.13.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.
1.13.4.2. Con: The church's official position may be different than a church member's or leader's personal position. An individual shouldn't lose his free speech rights due to the church having a different official position. The church shouldn't lose its tax exempt status because of one individual who disagrees with the church's official position.
1.13.4.3. Con: Not being tax exempt could actually benefit churches. They would then be allowed to express partisan political preference without fear of losing their tax exemption.
1.13.4.4. Con: The external and unrelated work which is sometimes done by prominent officials within churches is of no relevance to the question of whether their activities should be tax exempt, any more than it would be with any other charity.
1.13.4.5. Con: The confluence of lack of influence as a price of tax-exempt status ignores the First Amendment restricting the power of the Government: Amendment I. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. \(One cannot restrict the actions of Religion simply due to tax-exempt status\)
1.13.5. Con: -> See 1.7.4.
1.13.6. Con: It should be permissible and acceptable for a church to be politically active.
1.13.7. Pro: The government should never be allowed to give tax exemptions to politically active entities, since the government necessarily has an interest in some of those entities succeeding over others.
1.13.8. Con: It is hard to separate political issues from moral ones these days. Churches should speak out on moral issues. Their moral and charitable missions \(e.g. speaking out on child separation policy at the border, running homeless shelters\) are worthy of tax exemption. However, political activities \(e.g. supporting specific politicians\) run counter to this and if clearly proven should be cause for removal of tax exempt status. But the IRS would have to investigate and court dockets would be swamped.
1.13.9. Pro: It is true that many churches do provide income, some of which is used for charitable acts and some for the advancement of the church's point of view, such as the direct or indirect support of political candidates and issues. The former should be considered exempt and the latter taxable. As individuals we file returns every year that separate taxable from non-taxable. This could easily be adapted to religious institutions and organizations in a fair manner.
1.13.9.1. Pro: News in Utah during the 2018 election shows that some large churches expend huge sums to influence political processes, and sometimes exert enormous control. \( [Church Hires Firm to Fight Medical Marijuana](https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2018/05/11/mormon-church-compiles-legal-issues-with-medical-marijuana-initiative-but-still-doesnt-explicitly-oppose-it/)\) The legal fees, marketing, and other expenditures on these efforts are easily severable from charitable works.
1.13.9.2. Con: It is very difficult if not impossible to differentiate what is a charitable act and what pursues a point a view. Many actions are a combination of both. If a church body helps clean up after a tornado, they have the opportunity to advance their point of view \(beliefs\) with those who have suffered from the tornado.
1.13.10. Con: Organizations like Planned Parenthood are also 501\(c\)\(3\) and their leaders are very politically active. That is different than the organization itself using the money it collects to engage in political activities. If a church were found to be doing that, they would lose their 501\(c\)\(3\) status with the IRS.
1.14. Pro: Organizations generally – charitable or not – should never be tax exempt.
1.14.1. Con: Non profits offset the tax burden of the government by supporting its citizens more efficiently than the bureaucracy could. They utilize donations of time, money, and products from the public, freely given by those who can afford to do so, in order to support the needy or improve the community. These organizations and the individual donors should both be able to receive a tax break for doing work that improves the society and relieves the burden on the government to have to do the same work.
1.14.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.14.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.14.2. Con: Organisations that do public good \(which should be judged without regard to religious considerations\) are desirable to the state and often ultimately a benefit to the public purse, and should be encouraged and supported by the state. The most practical way to achieve this is via tax exemption.
1.14.2.1. Con: Not all organisations have honest ideals. If the organisation has nothing to hide, they need not fear individual scrutiny.
1.14.3. Pro: A larger tax base due to taxing all money transfers could mean lower individual taxes.
1.14.4. Pro: A non-profit organization will tend not to pay income tax anyway, since those are paid on profits. A non-profit that does not spend the large majority of its income is not a non-profit.
1.14.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.1.1.12.
1.14.5. Pro: Donations to charitable organizations should not be tax exempt.
1.14.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.15.
1.14.6. Pro: All non-profits should pay taxes as they enjoy the same infrastructure benefits as any other entity.
