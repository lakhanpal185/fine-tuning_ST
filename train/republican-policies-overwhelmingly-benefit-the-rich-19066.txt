Discussion Title: Republican policies overwhelmingly benefit the rich

1. Republican policies overwhelmingly benefit the rich
1.1. Con: Lowering the corporate tax rate encourages the retention of jobs stateside, benefiting the middle class.
1.1.1. Con: Historically, lowering the corporate tax rate simply prompts other countries to follow suit and drop their corporate tax rate to compete, resulting in a wash as far as jobs are concerned, while reducing federal revenues in all countries involved -which hurts the poor and middle class, only helping corporations to avoid taxation at the expense of the rest.
1.2. Pro: The Republican party is notoriously in favor of tax cuts/changes which tend to benefit the wealthy more than others, while paying for those tax cuts by cutting social programs, which tend to benefit the poor more.
1.2.1. Pro: Republicans have often promoted the implementation of a 'flat tax', which would in essence be a tax increase for the poor and tax cuts for the rich.
1.3. Pro: Republican propaganda often promotes 'trickle down economics', the idea that if we help the rich more, the benefits will 'trickle' down to the rest -an idea that is not supported by evidence.
1.4. Pro: Sitting Republicans unanimously supported Citizen's United, which gave the wealthy greater influence in our politics.
1.5. Pro: In recent years, virtually every proposition or push from the Republican party benefits the rich, while virtually none benefit the poor.
1.6. Con: Deregulation creates jobs, which can benefit those seeking work.
1.6.1. Con: Regulations create roughly as many jobs as they kill, while also protecting the public, employee rights, human rights, the environment, etc. "Many of the academic studies that have explored the question find that regulations donâ€™t decrease jobs in the overall economy. They sometimes reduce jobs in certain sectors, but they create new jobs in others."

1.6.2. Con: [Regulations are intended to protect against Market Failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation) like the 2007 housing collapse and subsequent economic recession. Market failures cause mass job loss.
1.7. Con: Tax cuts stimulate the economy, which benefits all of us.
1.7.1. Con: Although they may stimulate the economy in the short term, tax cuts also reduce federal revenues, which result in federal deficit unless they are offset by spending cuts, which very often adversely affect the poor disproportionately, and can lead to reduced consumerism and thus economic recession.
1.7.2. Con: Assuming they are even, across the board Tax cuts will benefit more those with higher incomes, reducing federal revenue in the process, which harms our country, disproportionately the poor and middle class.
1.7.3. Con: Tax cuts are benefiting [only the rich.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/12/opinion/editorials/trump-tax-cuts.html)
