Discussion Title: Doctors should be banned from performing genital reshaping surgery on intersex infants

1. Doctors should be banned from performing genital reshaping surgery on intersex infants.
1.1. Pro: Genital reshaping surgeries on intersex infants are unnecessary as they encourage conforming to outdated ideas of gender.
1.1.1. Con: Existing outside the gender binary has been shown to [adversely affect](https://www.boell.de/en/2017/10/09/being-outside-gender-binary-translates-worse-health) a person's health.
1.1.1.1. Con: Harms to the health of non-binary individuals is caused by a lack of understanding and acceptance of those existing outside the gender binary. Surgeries which propagate the need for such a binary perpetuate these problems.
1.1.1.2. Con: Most intersex children have been and are raised within gender binaries, gender reshaping surgeries have the goal to make intersex children conform to one gender or the other.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Many intersex children may, once they can make an informed decision, choose to have surgery in order to conform to whichever part of the gender binary they feel most comfortable in.
1.1.1.3. Con: The experiences of transgender and gender non-binary individuals in healthcare settings are negative because of [discrimination](https://www.boell.de/en/2017/10/09/being-outside-gender-binary-translates-worse-health), according to the quoted report, not per se due to individuals being outside the gender binary.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Procedures which reinforce the perceived abnormality of being intersex by forcibly assigning a gender identity to intersex infants are likely to perpetuate discrimination, and therefore the adverse consequences of occupying a non-binary gender identity.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Parents [frequently cite](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/should-we-fix-intersex-children/373536/) the desire to have their children "look normal" as a justification for performing surgery on them. This pressure would be decreased in a world where genital reshaping surgery on infants did not take place and therefore being visibly intersex was less unusual.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Children with ambiguous genitalia may be made to feel embarrassed or singled out by their peers when in situations such as in communal changing rooms.
1.1.2. Pro: Genital reshaping surgery steals a part of that person's identity in order to make them conform to societal norms. With growing acceptance for those who fit outside of these norms this loss is unnecessary.
1.1.3. Pro: Society is coming to understand that gender is on a [spectrum](https://www.genderspectrum.org/quick-links/understanding-gender/) and is not as easily defined as previously thought. With this broadening of viewpoints there is no need to force children surgically to fit into outdated moulds.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Society is changing to accept non-binary identities. While very [few](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-non-binary-people-how-to-be-respectful-and-supportive) intersex individuals are also non-binary, due to these changes it is now possible for intersex children to grow up outside of traditional gender identities until they are old enough to decide their own gender.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Germany](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24767225) allows babies who have characteristics from both sexes to be registered as neither sex on their birth certificates.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Oregon, Washington and Californian citizens have the option to change their [legal genders](http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/01/30/the-nonbinary-gender-trap/) from male or female to non-binary.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: In [Sweden](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5q3kb/watch-our-new-documentary-raised-without-gender) there are gender neutral kindergartens and examples of families who are raising their children genderless.
1.1.3.1.4. Pro: Target, one of the largest store chains in the United States, has launched a line of gender neutral [clothing](http://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/target-toca-boca-collection#2965721) for children.
1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.1.5. Pro: Surgeries are intended to help children conform to rigid gender stereotypes before being given a chance to express their sexual orientation or gender identity. This greatly undermines the right to [free expression](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us) as children develop into adults with a surgically-modified body intended to fit social norms, and not the individual’s sense of self.
1.1.5.1. Con: No infant body, unaltered or surgically-modified, is inherently designed to promote a person's sense of self.
1.1.6. Pro: Polls conducted in [Britain](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/09/25/majority-see-gender-socially-constructed/) and across the [Asia-Pacific](https://my.yougov.com/en-my/news/2017/08/14/gender/) demonstrate that a majority of people perceive gender as a social construct.
1.1.6.1. Con: People's perception of something is not proof of that thing as true or false. For example: if 70% of the US population said that the sun was blue, it still wouldn't be blue.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: Social constructs are created by and exist in people's perception. Therefore, it matters what people think of gender being a social construct.
1.1.7. Pro: Normalising surgeries are overwhelmingly based on outdated heteronormative assumptions and sex stereotypes that the child will automatically desire penetrative sex when they are grown. \([pp.64](https://interactadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Fraser-IJHRH-2016.pdf)\)
1.1.7.1. Pro: There is a [focus](http://www.isna.org/articles/ambivalent_medicine) on retaining female fertility in intersex infants, while male fertility is generally placed on a lower importance and testes are often removed. This reflects an outdated view of gender stereotypes.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Children with phalluses considered [too small](http://www.isna.org/articles/ambivalent_medicine) to engage in penetrative sex even if they have internal male organs are surgically made female.
1.1.7.3. Pro: After [normalising surgeries](http://www.isna.org/articles/ambivalent_medicine) for a penis to be considered functional it must fulfil a large range of actions. However, for a vagina to be considered functional it must only have a hole wide enough to accept an average penis.
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: Vaginal sensitivity and capacity for lubrication are not considerations when deciding if a vagina is [functional](http://www.isna.org/articles/ambivalent_medicine).
1.1.8. Pro: The argument that intersex children need reshaping surgery to live "normally" is circular. Being intersex would be less abnormal if it weren't for doctors carrying out surgeries in an attempt to erase children's intersex status.
1.1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.
1.1.9. Pro: Instead of a direct cause/effect relationship, the adverse health effect on a gender non-binary individual has more to do with lack of knowledge, or compassion, of the medical community. Therefore, the individual is less likely to seek out treatment for health issues.
1.2. Con: Genital reshaping surgery can help avoid medical complications later in life.
1.2.1. Con: Genital reshaping surgery can cause immediate problems for the individuals undergoing it.
1.2.1.1. Pro: While very rare, individuals can [die](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3147285/) as a result of undergoing general anesthesia.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Surgical site infections are [common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24180342) in genital reconstruction surgeries, which are not very dissimilar procedures operating on the same tissues.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Blood clots are a [serious complication](https://www.verywell.com/blood-clots-during-and-after-surgery-3156814) that individuals undergoing surgery can face.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Because of the invasive nature of surgeries, [there is](https://www.verywell.com/what-is-the-risk-of-death-from-surgery-3157294) always a chance that an individual may die.
1.2.1.5. Pro: A [variety](https://www.verywell.com/understanding-the-risks-involved-when-having-surgery-3156959) of problems with recovery may arise as a result of a surgical procedure. This may include paralysis, a slow recovery rate, chronic pain, difficulty in breathing and scarring etc.
1.2.2. Pro: Intersex surgery can help [reduce](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/surgery-intersex-infants-and-human-rights-2009) the risk of recurrent urinary tract infections.
1.2.3. Pro: [Gonadectomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5107383/) can help reduce the risk of cancer in intersex individuals with a Y chromosome.
1.2.4. Pro: Genital reconstruction surgery [is used to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex_medical_interventions#Purposes_of_genital_reconstructive_surgery) close open wounds or exposed internal organs.
1.2.4.1. Con: Procedures to prevent short-term health risks such as infections caused by open wounds or exposed internal organs are medically necessary, and likely do not fall under the definition of "genital reshaping surgery", the function of which is to assign a gender.
1.2.5. Pro: Genital reconstruction is aimed at retaining or improving [urinary continence](http://www.writing.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.writ.d7/files/sitefiles/publications/2012_ScottG.pdf).
1.2.5.1. Con: There is a [possibility](http://www.writing.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.writ.d7/files/sitefiles/publications/2012_ScottG.pdf) that instead it could cause incontinence due to moving the urethra or damaging the urinary control mechanism.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Some genital reshaping surgery involves creating a [urinary drainage opening](http://www.isna.org/faq/patient-centered) for an infant born without one.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: Late complications and chronic problems [can present](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/au/2012/705212/) after hypospadias repair surgeries.
1.2.6. Con: The only intersex condition which can be classified as a medical emergency is [congenital adrenal hyperplasia](http://www.isna.org/faq/medical_risks/cah) which is treated with cortisol, not through surgery.
1.2.6.1. Con: Medical emergencies are not the same as [medically necessary surgeries](http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Ce-Fi/Essential-Surgery.html). These are often performed in order to correct physical defects \(e.g. no urethral opening\) - not to "choose" a gender.
1.2.7. Pro: There is no reason to wait until the child can decide because there will always be a more dominant sexual feature \(which can be determined with hormonal or genetic testing\) upon birth, and that should be chosen. Inaction early on may be medically and psychologically detrimental to the child.
1.2.7.1. Con: Genital reshaping procedures can inflict psychological harm on intersex patients.
1.2.7.1.1. Pro: [50%](https://web.archive.org/web/20160914152729/http://oii.org.au/wp-content/uploads/key/Intersex-Stories-Statistics-Australia.pdf) of a sample of intersex individuals who had gone through surgery reported psychological issues. This is detrimental in their attempts to lead a "normal" life.
1.2.7.1.2. Pro: A [United Nations](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us) report found that surgeries performed without the informed consent of patients, or that of their parents, left them with permanent, irreversible infertility which caused severe mental suffering.
1.2.7.1.3. Pro: A [report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us) found that intersex patients are subject to pejorative or stigmatizing language from doctors, repeated genital examinations and photography, and exposure of their bodies to multiple practitioners. These medical interventions were found to be traumatizing for intersex patients.
1.2.7.1.4. Pro: A [report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us) found that intersex patients experienced feelings of 'dread' decades after unwanted or damaging surgeries and repeated examinations, when attempting to access healthcare. For some, this has led them to avoid healthcare as adults.
1.2.7.1.5. Pro: The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture included forced genital reshaping surgery as an issue of concern in his [2013 report](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf), calling for an end to "any law allowing intrusive and irreversible treatments, including forced genital-normalizing surgery...administered without the free and informed consent of the person concerned."
1.2.7.2. Con: Genital reshaping surgery can cause long term medical complications itself.
1.2.7.2.1. Pro: When these surgeries can have longterm medical maintenance it makes sense to postpone them until later in life so that the patient can have a normal childhood.
1.2.7.2.1.1. Pro: Children with vaginal hypoplasia can have vaginoplasty to remedy the diagnosis. After this procedure the patients are required to have their vaginas dilated three times a week, a very painful procedure, until they become sexually active. \(pp.[394](https://interactadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/09_59.3reis.pdf)\)
1.2.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Aside from pain, requiring medical treatment on such a frequent basis drastically interferes with having a normal childhood; from play-dates and after school activities to simply having time to complete homework, a child's life is significantly disrupted by frequent medical appointments.
1.2.7.2.1.1.2. Pro: This procedure can be extremely [emotionally scarring](http://www.isna.org/node/1023) for the child it is performed on.
1.2.7.2.1.1.3. Pro: There's no guarantee that vaginoplasty improves the individual's ability to have a fulfilling sex life as an adult.
1.2.7.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Data on the outcome for sexual function after childhood feminizing genitoplasty procedures [are sparse](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.06855.x), with details on the assessment process often limited.
1.2.7.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: There is [little information](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.06855.x) about the impact of genital surgery on psychosexual development and functioning.
1.2.7.2.1.1.4. Pro: Seeing as this process only has to occur until they are sexually active it is completely unnecessary to perform it in infancy. Performing it for those who wish to become sexually active, would mean that the patient would have to undergo less dilations as they would be able to engage in sexual activity as soon as was medically advised after the procedure.
1.2.7.2.1.2. Pro: [Gonadectomy](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us), a surgery often performed on people who have Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome [\(CAIS\)](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/androgen-insensitivity-syndrome), results in lifelong hormone replacement treatments.
1.2.7.2.1.2.1. Pro: This surgery also can end [options](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5607629/) for fertility.
1.2.7.2.1.2.2. Con: For these patients the risks are justified as the presence of testes [heighten](http://www.isna.org/faq/printable) their risk of cancer.
1.2.7.2.1.2.2.1. Con: This does not mean that the surgery should occur in infancy. As testicular cancer is [rarer](http://www.isna.org/faq/printable) before puberty the surgery should be delayed until the patient can consent.
1.2.7.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The medical age of consent in [most states is 18.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008301/) Waiting until they are able to legally consent themselves leaves the individual at risk of developing testicular cancer during puberty.
1.2.7.2.1.2.2.2. Con: Testicular cancer has a relatively excellent [survival rate](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/testicular-cancer/statistics), with 99% surviving when the cancer is caught in stage 1 and 68% of cases being caught at that stage.
1.2.7.2.1.2.2.2.1. Con: The survival rate is largely based on people with unambiguous genitalia; ambiguous genitalia can make it harder to diagnose abnormalities in testicles in order to catch cancer in stage 1.
1.2.7.2.1.2.2.3. Con: Individuals are entitled to make informed decisions about their bodies even when choosing not to undergo a surgery may increase their risk of illness.
1.2.7.2.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: We do not, for example, pre-emptively perform mastectomies on people with the BRCA1 gene despite their [elevated risk of developing breast cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet).
1.2.7.2.1.2.2.4. Con: Hormone replacement therapy itself [increases](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/hormones-and-cancer/hrt-and-cancer) the risk of cancer.
1.2.7.2.1.3. Pro: Most children undergoing feminizing surgery [require](http://www.jpagonline.org/article/S1083-3188\(01\)00112-7/fulltext) further treatment in puberty.
1.2.7.2.2. Pro: Being put under general anesthetic as an infant heightens the risk of suffering from [developmental and behavioural issues](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101018163301.htm) later in life.
1.2.7.2.2.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3497865/) found that children who had undergone two or more surgeries which required a general anaesthetic before the age of two were more than two-fold more likely to suffer from ADHD in later life.
1.2.7.2.2.1.1. Con: Children who are required to have two or more surgeries before the age of two most likely have serious [health](https://www.cerebralpalsyguidance.com/cerebral-palsy/associated-disorders/adhd/) [problems](https://www.gulfbend.org/poc/view_doc.php?type=news&id=196652&cn=3) and so that may be the cause of the higher rate of ADHD. Children with ADHD are also more likely than children without ADHD to sustain [physical injuries](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/750259).
1.2.8. Con: -> See 1.2.7.2.
1.2.9. Con: According to the [Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/118/2/e488.full.pdf), gender reshaping surgery has historically been mostly for cosmetic reasons.
1.2.9.1. Con: The intention behind the surgery does not discount the benefits accrued from undergoing it.
1.2.10. Con: Their is no definitive proof that genital reshaping surgery on intersex infants provides any health benefits either short or long term. In fact, there is a considerable amount of proof of the opposite.
1.2.10.1. Pro: Genital reshaping surgeries can have an impact on the sexual and reproductive rights and health of patients later in life.
1.2.10.1.1. Pro: Removal of parts of the clitoris often leads to a loss of sensation, inability to orgasm and other [sexual problems](http://www.isna.org/pdf/MintoLancet2003.pdf).
1.2.10.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.2.1.
1.2.10.1.3. Pro: A [report](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/07/26/unnecessary-surgery-on-intersex-kids-causes-permanent-harm/) from the Human Rights Watch found that the removal of testicles, which the child would be unable to consent to, is equal to sterilization without consent.
1.2.10.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.2.2.
1.2.10.1.3.2. Pro: Although removal of testes is advisable, because of the risk of cancer, ISNA advocates that surgery be offered later, when the girl can choose for herself. Testicular cancer is rare before puberty.
1.2.10.2. Pro: Depending on the condition, the risk of surgically assigning the wrong sex at birth can be as high as [40 per cent](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us).
1.2.10.2.1. Pro: Percentage is likely higher, as the medical industry counts those who are deceased as having been assigned their gender "successfully" regardless of the knowledge that the deceased had a lifetime of related problems from incorrect gender assignment. This has been discussed by [Dr. Tiger Devore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m84MfB0yN10).
1.2.11. Con: -> See 1.2.10.1.
1.2.12. Pro: Connective tissue, skin, and organs of infants [heal faster](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fountain-of-youth-scientists-discover-why-wounds-heal-quicker-for-young-people-8927387.html) than adults. Having the surgery earlier in life lessens the chances of complications later on.
1.2.12.1. Con: Adults are able to give informed consent to potentially enhanced risks at a later stage. All infants should not have to undergo potentially unwanted procedures that they cannot consent to, just so that, later, a consenting adult would be spared potential complications.
1.2.12.2. Con: Those potential complications would only be an issue if the person wished to undergo the procedure as an adult, which not all intersex people do.
1.3. Pro: It is better to wait until potential patients are adolescents or adults to perform such surgery.
1.3.1. Pro: The surgeries are irreversible, meaning that if a child grows up to regret the choice that was made for them they have to continue to live with the consequences.
1.3.2. Pro: For the sake of conforming their child to the subjective perception of 'normal', parents may actually exacerbate their suffering due to the health risks of the surgery. Therefore, it is better to allow intersex children to reach adolescence in order to make the decision for themselves.
1.3.2.1. Pro: A [report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us) found that parents said they would have elected cosmetic surgery on their children’s genitals no matter what the potential health risks surgeons had cited to them, because they wanted their children to look "normal."
1.3.3. Pro: [Studies](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/97/2/577/2836401) recommend postponing such surgeries until adolescence or adulthood so that potential patients have the capacity to decide for themselves.
1.3.4. Pro: Some intersex people who have had surgery as infants [report](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/08/09/intersex-children-no-surgery-without-consent-zieselman-column/539853001/) the surgeries as having made them feel abnormal and not accepted by their families and society.
1.3.4.1. Pro: This is due to the fact that the surgeries are performed on them as infants as a way of "fixing" them. If the surgeries are presented as a choice later in life it could cause less psychological damage.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Children tend to find events [more traumatising](http://www.utahcountycounselors.com/2015/04/23/are-children-really-resilient/) than people who experience similar events in adulthood.
1.3.5. Pro: Some biological traits, with regards to gonads and chromosomes, manifest differently to the assigned sex at birth once the child reaches [puberty](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us). This means that an infant whose gender was assigned as male at birth may start to express female biological characteristics once they reach puberty, contradicting the assigned gender during infancy. Therefore, it is better to allow the infant to mature biologically before considering surgery.
1.3.6. Con: A person who hasn’t had the surgery performed may needlessly struggle until they come of age.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Intersex people suffer from [many health risks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27823735/#fft) due to being intersex, and may needlessly suffer from them when they could have been mitigated by surgery.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Intersex children may be needlessly bullied by their peers.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.3.6.2.2. Con: Arguably, bullying is the lesser evil, when compared to the potential lifelong harms of irreversible surgeries.
1.3.6.2.3. Con: Surgeries do not remove the possibility of intersex children being bullied.
1.3.6.2.3.1. Pro: Many intersex children still [report](http://www.writing.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.writ.d7/files/sitefiles/publications/2012_ScottG.pdf) appearing "different" from other children as they age, despite undergoing genital reshaping surgery.
1.3.6.2.4. Con: The potential for intersex children being bullied can be removed by ensuring parents of intersex children are supported by their peers and have access to parent support groups.
1.3.6.2.4.1. Pro: A [report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us) found that parents who rejected early surgery said that their children had not faced unusual amounts of bullying or harassment because of their intersex traits. Parents credited the peer support and information they received from parent support groups for making this possible.
1.3.6.3. Pro: Getting used to an anomalous anatomy may cause pain and suffering for a child which can easily be circumvented.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: Most parents have no idea how to deal with intersex children even if they've had children before because society currently is based strongly around gender identities. Having children who aren't naturally subscribed to either identity makes it a difficult task assigning one to them.
1.3.6.3.1.1. Pro: Intersex children may not be comfortable with the gender that their parents raise them as, causing long term gender identity issues.
1.3.6.3.1.1.1. Con: That may happen regardless if they get reshaping genital surgery or not.
1.3.6.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Intersex children often [don't identify](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/intersex-children-pose-ethical-dilemma-doctors-parents-genital/story?id=13153068) with the sex they're assigned through surgery.
1.3.6.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Genital reshaping surgery came about as a result of the theory of [psychosexual neutrality](http://www.isna.org/pdf/MintoLancet2003.pdf); that is, the belief that children are born gender neutral at birth and that if they are raised to identify as a particular gender then they will. This theory has never been proven.
1.3.6.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The existence of individuals who identify as transgender proves that this theory does not hold true for everyone.
1.3.6.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.2.
1.3.6.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: However if they do not have the surgery they will find it easier to transition to their actual gender. Surgeries can take away parts of their anatomy they may actually want.
1.3.6.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: There are approximately [1.4 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/health/transgender-population.html) transgender people in the US today, the majority of whom were uncomfortable with the gender they were raised, which shows that intersex people could also experience discomfort without surgery.
1.3.6.3.1.1.2. Pro: Intersex children are [substantially more likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701969/) than other children to end up identifying as the opposite gender to that which they were assigned at birth, a circumstance which calls for more parental caution in the assignment of gender.
1.3.6.3.1.2. Con: Performing reshaping genital surgery and later procedures on intersex children may not help in assigning a specific gender identity to them either.
1.3.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.3.1.1.1.1.
1.3.6.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.6.3.3. Pro: Children generally associate themselves with cultural icons e.g. superheroes, cartoons, barbies etc. Intersex children have no such icons that they can subscribe to and thus may feel singled out and unnatural.
1.3.6.3.3.1. Pro: The lack of colored dolls in the market and their subsequent adaptation by big toy brands [shows](https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/black-is-beautiful-why-black-dolls-matter/) how deeply cultural icons affect children.
1.3.6.3.3.2. Con: There are several [comic book superheroes](http://itsuperheroes.wikia.com/wiki/IT_Superheroes_Wiki) who are explicitly intersex, including [Masquerade](http://itsuperheroes.wikia.com/wiki/Masquerade_\(Sissy_Walker\)) \([Pride Comics](http://www.pridecomics.com/)\), who was rejected by her parents because of ambiguous genitalia after an unsuccessful invasive surgery.
1.3.6.3.3.3. Con: Vogue supermodel [Hanne Gaby Odiele](http://nationalpost.com/news/0125-na-intersex) has publicly come out as intersex - she was born with internal testes that were removed when she was 10.
1.3.6.3.3.4. Con: There are many successful and famous [intersex athletes](https://listverse.com/2015/10/25/10-famous-intersex-athletes/).
1.3.6.3.3.5. Con: Intersex Solidarity Day is observed on the 8th of November - the birthday of [Herculine Barbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculine_Barbin), an intersex person famous for their memoirs.
1.3.6.3.4. Pro: Having different sexual organs at a young age when one is naturally curious may lead children to feel singled out and question their parents as to why they look different than "normal" children.
1.3.6.3.5. Con: -> See 1.3.5.
1.3.6.3.6. Con: We do not cosmetically "fix" any other physical difference in infants, such as obvious or large birth marks, in order to make them look like other children. It is unclear why children's genitalia is different.
1.3.6.3.7. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.3.7. Con: -> See 1.2.12.
1.4. Pro: It is wrong to perform a life-altering procedure on someone who cannot consent to it.
1.4.1. Con: Parents decide many other life altering things for their children that have permanent consequences, but children don't get any say in it because the parents deem it right for them.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Moving to a new city may drastically affect a child's socializing and have a psychological impact as a child may struggle to fit in a new place and make new friends, but children rarely have a say in their parents making this decision for them.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Moving to a new city is a relatively common and reversible experience which could have positive or negative effects on a given child. Genital reshaping surgery is an irreversible procedure which potentially causes [drastic long-term health issues](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/us-harmful-surgery-intersex-children) in those subjected to it.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: While moving to a city is generally quite common, it is still highly challenging for the child to adapt to that change and the effects of that are not easily reversible.
1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Unlike genital reshaping surgery, moving city may be a positive or a negative experience for a child entirely depending on their circumstances, and so we trust parents to make that decision in the absence of clear reasons for intervention.
1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The state would intervene in the decision by parents to move a child to a new city if it had specific reason for doing so.
1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the context of joint custody agreements between separated parents, for example, the court may stipulate that the parents live within a certain distance of each other in order to maximise the welfare of the child.
1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Evidence for the medical benefit of genital reshaping surgery is [limited](https://www.palmcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Re-Thinking-Genital-Surgeries-1.pdf), while the damage it can do is [well-documented](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/us-harmful-surgery-intersex-children). The state therefore has reason to assume that on balance preventing parents from making this decision is likely to maximise child welfare.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Values and morals that are imparted to children permanently affect their outlook on life, even if it is something that they will regret as adults. Children do not have a say in how they are socialized.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Values and morals can adapt and change for the individual as time goes on but the effects of an irreversible procedure cannot.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: There are always limits to the choices parents can make for their children - the state intervenes in child socialisation through the educational system and child protection services.
1.4.1.3. Con: Just because a parent can consent to something on behalf of their child does not mean that they should.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Parents are often [uninformed](http://www.isna.org/pdf/Doctor's_Orders_Feder2002.pdf) \(p.295\) of the reality of the child's conditions and the potential risks of the surgery.
1.4.1.4. Con: There are stark limits on the rights of parents to make decisions which result in permanent changes to the bodies of their children. They are generally not permitted, for example, to elect to have cosmetic surgery performed on their children in the absence of a pressing medical reason.
1.4.1.4.1. Con: The practice of the elective circumcision of newborn males is widespread [throughout the world](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772313/).
1.4.1.4.1.1. Con: In addition to the cultural and religious traditions underlying the practice of male circumcision, it has a number of significant health benefits, [particularly with regard to HIV prevention](http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/jc1360_male_circumcision_en_2.pdf). It is thus not analogous to the decision to perform medically unnecessary reshaping surgery on an intersex infant.
1.4.1.4.1.1.1. Con: [14% of parents](http://www.circinfo.net/what_motivates_parents_to_get_their_baby_boy_circumcised.html) claimed that a factor that influenced their decision to circumcise their child was the idea that circumcised penises are more attractive to future sexual partners.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Con: Female genital mutilation, circumcision and normalisation surgery on intersex children are increasingly being viewed as [equally wrong](https://theconversation.com/how-different-are-female-male-and-intersex-genital-cutting-77569) on non-consenting infants. However they are not viewed as morally equal in the law.
1.4.1.4.1.3. Con: -> See discussion #13673: Infant circumcision should be banned
1.4.1.5. Pro: Parents have an unavoidable responsibility to care for the interests of their child. 

Attempting to circumvent this responsibility entrusts the best interests of children in the hands of abstract, distant representatives with no skin-in-the-game regarding the child.
1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.1.3.
1.4.3. Pro: [Informed consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent) is one of the most fundamental principles of medical ethics.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Informed consent is also [legally required](http://ethics.missouri.edu/informed-consent.html) in many places in the world before medical procedures can be undertaken.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Parents can consent to medical procedures on behalf of their children when they deem it necessary.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Most medical procedures that have severe side effects are consented to by parents rather than children, if the child is too young. An example may be chemotherapy which is an incredibly arduous process to go through, but parents make the choice for children.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Chemotherapy may be advised as medically necessary to treat a disease, whereas, in many instances, genital reshaping surgery is carried out for cosmetic reasons.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.3.
1.4.3.1.1.3. Con: [Some research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679868) suggests that there can be substantial parental regret after medical interventions.
1.4.3.1.1.4. Pro: Given the [health risks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/27823735/#fft) specific to intersex individuals, the parents' decision for the infant to have surgery can minimise their child's suffering until they're of age.
1.4.3.1.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.4.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.4.3.1.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.4.3.1.1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.4.3.1.1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.4.3.1.1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.4.3.1.1.5. Con: When the surgery can as easily be achieved at a later age, there is no reason for parents to make the choice for their children. This way everyone can decide the best course of action for themselves rather than writing some individuals who didn't want the surgery off as collateral.
1.4.3.1.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.12.
1.4.3.1.1.6. Con: There is insufficient or misleading information that affects decision making.
1.4.3.1.1.6.1. Pro: Parental decisions [depend on](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23742202) the health professional counselling received, to a degree of which neither parents nor professionals appear fully aware. There is a danger of medicalised or demedicalised parentalism resulting in irreversible and inadequately grounded decisions.
1.4.3.1.1.6.2. Pro: Parents may not realise that they are consenting to [experimental surgery](https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h5124) on their children.
1.4.3.1.1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.3.1.
1.4.3.1.1.6.4. Pro: In infancy, a child's personality is far from fully formed. A parent has no way of knowing what their child would consent to if that child fully understood the options.
1.4.3.1.1.6.5. Pro: A [report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us) found parents were presented with medically unnecessary surgery as an urgent need at least once during their pursuit of care for their child.
1.4.3.1.1.6.6. Pro: A report highlighted how parents felt they made the decision for genital reshaping surgery to be performed [without](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us) complete information.
1.4.3.1.1.7. Con: Parents may not be comfortable enough with the issue to make an unbiased decision.
1.4.3.1.1.7.1. Pro: A [report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us) found that parents were pressured by doctors to undertake irreversible medical procedures. If parents resisted or asked questions, they were made to feel being unreasonable. As a consequence, parents may feel uncomfortable to make an unbiased decision.
1.4.3.1.1.7.2. Con: Making medical decisions on behalf of children is always difficult for parents, but they are the sole appropriate actor to decide on the necessity of surgery when the child is too young to make an informed choice.
1.4.3.1.1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.7.1.
1.4.3.1.1.7.3. Pro: Parents of intersex infants may feel distressed and give in to their desire to have a "normal" child without properly assessing the risks of surgery.
1.4.3.1.1.7.4. Pro: Parents are not in the best position to consider all the factors in question; for example, many parents would find it uncomfortable to have to consider the impact it would have on their child's future sex life.
1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.
1.5. Pro: The procedure often comes with many health risks.
1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.5.4. Pro: Genital reshaping of intersex children whose parents choose to raise them as female often involves surgical removal of parts of the [clitoris](http://www.isna.org/pdf/MintoLancet2003.pdf).
1.5.4.1. Pro: If it is so universally condemned that primitive tribes perform female circumcision, surely it is hypocritical to deny the potential for pleasure for someone who has anomalous genitalia.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Surgical practises that include clitoral cutting when the procedure is not necessary to the health of the patient is considered female genital mutilation and is [illegal](https://interactadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Fraser-IJHRH-2016.pdf) in the US. It is therefore unclear why normalising surgeries on intersex children which breaks this law has been allowed up to this point in the US.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.1.2.
1.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.1.1.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.2.
1.5.6. Pro: [Operations](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/us-harmful-surgery-intersex-children) to alter the size or appearance of children’s genitals risk incontinence, scarring, lack of sensation, and psychological trauma. The procedures are irreversible, nerves that are severed cannot regrow, and scar tissue can limit options for future surgery.
1.5.6.1. Pro: Vaginoplasty carries a [particularly high risk](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/should-we-fix-intersex-children/373536/) of vaginal stenosis, whereby the vagina is narrowed and made rigid by scar tissue. This can lead to secondary tears, reduced sensation and a risk of infection.
1.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.1.
1.5.8. Con: Individuals with [Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/478082) may require gonadectomy to reduce their risk of cancer.
1.5.8.1. Con: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.2.2.1.
1.5.8.2. Con: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.2.2.2.
1.5.8.3. Con: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.2.2.3.
1.5.8.4. Con: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.2.
1.5.9. Pro: Many people who undergo genital reshaping surgery as infants require multiple [follow-ups](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2008/11/stanford-author-explores-struggles-of-intersex-individuals-their-families-and-doctors.html) to deal with scarring and other issues.
1.5.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.1.
1.5.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.2.1.3.
1.6. Con: It is wrong to ban a surgery that might be the best course of action for some individuals on the basis that it is not the best course of action for all individuals.
1.6.1. Con: Banning the surgeries for infants means that it will only be performed for consenting adults for whom the surgery is the best course of action.
1.6.1.1. Con: Delaying potentially life-saving medical interventions until the individuals in question are adults may lead to unnecessary suffering or death on their part.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: It is reasonable and standard practice to assume consent on the part of individuals to life-saving medical interventions where they are unable to provide or refuse consent on their own behalf.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.6.2. Pro: The lives of some intersex individuals may be endangered by their condition, and they are entitled to treatment which maximises their quality of life and long-term health outcomes.
1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.8.
1.6.3. Pro: The [Intersex Society of North America](http://www.isna.org/faq/patient-centered) advocates that medically necessary procedures can and should be performed on intersex infants.
1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.6.4. Pro: Parents are less likely to go ahead with medically unnecessary cosmetic procedures now that research has shown the harms of doing so, so there is no need to ban all procedures in order to prevent this.
1.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.7.1.
1.6.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.7.3.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Advice given to parents of intersex children nowadays frequently advocates [against early surgical intervention](https://www.parents.com/parenting/what-to-do-if-you-have-an-intersex-child/).
1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.5.
1.6.6. Con: The surgery isn't banned for life. Individuals who want to get it can still get it at a later point in their life out of their own volition. What is banned is letting parents make an irreversible choice for their children.
1.6.6.1. Con: Surgery on an infant may sometimes be the best course of action for that child; a blanket ban would put these children at a unique disadvantage.
1.6.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.6.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.7. Con: Genital reshaping surgery can help ensure the intersex child can live as socially "normal" a life as possible.
1.7.1. Con: A [report](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/07/26/unnecessary-surgery-on-intersex-kids-causes-permanent-harm/) from the Human Rights Watch found that there is no evidence that surgery delivers on the promise of making it easier to live a 'normal' life, but ample evidence that it risks causing irreversible lifelong harm.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.7.3. Con: There has not been sufficient [research](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us) to prove that these surgeries aid the patient in any way or that there is any harm in growing up with atypical genitals.
1.7.4. Con: In some cases intersex traits would not be obvious until puberty or have to do with internal organs and so would not affect the child's outwards appearance. In these cases there is no reason for the child to have an "abnormal" childhood.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.2.7.1.1.
1.7.6. Con: -> See 1.1.8.
1.7.7. Con: "Normally", children aren't publicly exposing their genitals, so this should be moot.
1.7.8. Con: All sense of 'normalcy' is eradicated from an individual's life if they grow up and decide that they didn't want the surgery as a whole, or didn't want to be the gender their parents picked for them. In that scenario, they are anything but normal - living a life picked for them that they had no choice and desire to be a part of.
1.7.9. Pro: Studies show that genital reshaping surgery [improves](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/2/e488?sso=1&sso_redirect_count=1&nfstatus=401&nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token) the attachment between the infant and parents.
1.7.9.1. Con: No conclusive proof of an improvement of attachment exists, while proof of the opposite is available in hundreds of interviews with intersex individuals and their parents later in life. Most parents of intersex children who underwent reshaping surgeries are also told by most medical professionals to keep the entire matter secret and never admit it to or discuss it with their children, which is in fact quite [damaging](https://theconversation.com/orchids-sheds-light-on-the-secrecy-surrounding-intersex-5030).
1.7.10. Con: A [report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us) found that the impact of the negative experiences with receiving long term medical care, as a result of having genital reshaping surgery, extended beyond the physical outcomes or desires to be socially “normal.”
1.8. Pro: Intersex children should be able to decide the gender they are raised as.
1.8.1. Pro: There may be disagreement between the parents regarding the choice of gender. It is better to leave the choice to the children themselves, as this can help eliminate familial tension.
1.8.2. Con: Individuals who identify as transsexual or transgender as adults are not given the choice as children since parents are the ones making decisions for them. It seems natural under current societal norms that if parents can raise a biologically male child as male, even if they will later identify as female, then they may pick the gender for intersex children too.
1.8.2.1. Con: Transgender children being raised as the wrong gender is an unfortunate occurrence that often causes harm to them. It does not justify the same harm being done to intersex children.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/science-public/transgender-children-are-greater-risk-mental-health-problems) have found that transgender individuals are at a far greater risk of developing mental health issues.
1.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: In Ireland, [78%](http://www.teni.ie/page.aspx?contentid=673) of transgender people have experienced suicidal ideation.
1.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.6.3.1.1.2.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.3.1.1.1.1.
1.8.4. Pro: Most laws recognize one's right to bodily integrity.
1.8.4.1. Pro: In the US, The Supreme Court has, in the landmark decision [Roe v. Wade](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html) 410 U.S. 113 \(1973\), determined that a person \(woman\) has the right, under the Constitution, to make determinations for their own body. This law has the far reaching platform of "Self" ownership. The body is the sole property of the individual. These doctors are playing God when they take the choice from the child born intersexed.
1.8.5. Pro: Many people born [intersex](https://www.bradley.edu/sites/bodyproject/sexuality/intersexuality/), who have had the corrective surgery when babies, as they grew up, they did not identify as the reassigned gender. The pain they go through to “recorrect” is sometimes way too much for them and they [take their own lives](https://ihra.org.au/30313/intersex-stories-statistics-australia/).
1.8.6. Con: Young children, especially pre-puberty, may not fully understand the implications of this decision.
1.8.6.1. Con: Children can be raised gender neutral until they are of an age to realise the gender with which they identify.
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.8.6.2. Con: Children who decide to continue their lives as the gender they were raised don't understand the implications of being that gender, yet their choice is rarely brought into question.
1.8.6.3. Con: By age four, most children have a stable sense of their [gender identity](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx).
1.8.6.4. Pro: [According to a paper](http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi) investigating best practices for intersex surgery: "The child should meet with doctors and counsellors at the hospital over a period of time and only once they feel that the child is fully informed and completely understands his condition, the surgery, and the repercussions of the surgery, the doctors and hospital can accept the child’s consent."
1.8.7. Pro: Deciding their child's gender without their child's consent can cause friction in a family when the child learns the truth.
