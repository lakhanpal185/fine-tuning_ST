Discussion Title: Should Planned Parenthood Be Defunded?

1. Planned Parenthood should be defunded
1.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood targets and exploits minorities.
1.1.1. Con: Planned Parenthood seeks to serve every income level and community, with 56% of their centers in rural or underserved areas.  By definition, they're actually in places where minorities are & without access to other resources.
1.1.1.1. Con: That's the problem. Abortion can be a eugenic practice, and the deliberate placement of many of their clinics in areas of marginalized groups indicate that it may be the purpose of all or some in its administration.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The founder of the Birth Control League \(today's PP\), Margaret Sanger, [advocated](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/webedition/app/documents/show.php?sangerDoc=129037.xml) eugenics to increase the overall intelligence in the population. "... feeble-minded, idiots, morons, insane, syphiletic, epileptic, criminal, professional prostitutes" etc., would get the option between segregation from the rest of society or to be sterilized. She sought to minimize reproduction by those "known to be detrimental to the stamina of the race."
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: [Margaret Sanger](https://www.biography.com/people/margaret-sanger-9471186) actually [differed from Eugenicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger#Eugenics).
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Theodore Roosevelt, 26th POTUS & Nobel Prize recipient, was also an advocate of Eugenics. Volkswagon the auto company was originally operated by a Nazi organization. We can't really infer anything about todays organizations from that. [Eugenics Archive](http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/connections/5233dd265c2ec500000000c9) [History of VW](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/volkswagen-is-founded)
1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: From Sanger's speech it seems that the Birth Control League may have been created as a vehicle for the eugenicist cause. Comparing Teddy Roosevelt in this sense would be like an employee later being hired by the BCL, because the Nobel Prize and POTUS title existed long before him. As for the Volkswagen, it wasn't created to gas the Jews with.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Locating your 'business' close to your 'client base' is standard practice that makes logistical and economical sense.
1.1.2. Pro: Donors are able to [call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVMiwqIWXF0) and specify their donations to go to abortions for minority groups such as African-Americans, which is a racist eugenicist strategy to make those of that race produce less offspring for the next generation.
1.1.2.1. Con: On average Americans of Colour have less income to spend on [accessing healthcare services](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4711386/), even after the introduction of the affordable healthcare act. Ensuring that there are funds specifically set aside for these people to access necessary healthcare is not racism, it is the opposite.
1.2. Con: Planned Parenthood provides vital healthcare services to low-income individuals.
1.2.1. Pro: In 2014, 20 million women required access to [publicly funded](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a19995608/defunding-planned-parenthood/) contraception due to poverty or low income.
1.2.2. Pro: Defunding Planned Parenthood could mean leaving these lower income individuals without access to reproductive healthcare, as they may not be able to afford a private clinic.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Futhermore, if Planned Parenthood is defunded it is likely it would have to [close clinics](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-would-happen-if-planned-parenthood-was-defunded-6-frightening-options-2950007) due to lack of funds- this would mean the demand on private clinics would surge, and wait times would increase for everyone.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: There are not enough private healthcare providers in America to be able to cope with demand should Planned Parenthood have to [close clinics](https://www.istandwithpp.org/defund-defined/impact-defunding-planned-parenthood).
1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: In 21% of counties with a Planned Parenthood clinic, PP is the [only family planning service](https://www.istandwithpp.org/defund-defined/impact-defunding-planned-parenthood) provider.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: In 68% of counties with a family planning centre, Planned Parenthood serves [at least half](https://www.istandwithpp.org/defund-defined/impact-defunding-planned-parenthood)of all patients seeking family planning services.
1.2.2.2. Pro: In particular Planned Parenthood may be the only clinic in a [rural area.](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-would-happen-if-planned-parenthood-was-defunded-6-frightening-options-2950007) Closing these clinics would have a great effect on the reproductive health of rural America.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Private clinics that accept [Medicaid](https://www.istandwithpp.org/defund-defined/impact-defunding-planned-parenthood) \(which Planned Parenthood does\) are few and far between, further complicating access for low income individuals.
1.2.3. Pro: In Texas, when Planned Parenthood was defunded, one study reported that pregnancy- related deaths [doubled](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Texas-pregnancy-related-deaths-double-9172022.php).
1.2.4. Pro: Approximately[1 in 5 Americans](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Texas-pregnancy-related-deaths-double-9172022.php) will visit, and require Planned Parenthood's services at some point in their life.
1.2.5. Con: Planned parenthood provides more services than just abortions.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood is not only offering abortions but a host of other [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood#Services), such as clinical breast examination.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood provides abortions to [fewer than 15%](https://www.factcheck.org/2015/09/planned-parenthoods-services/) of its patients. Thus, the chief effect of de-funding it would be to deprive people of non-abortion healthcare.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Pregnancy tests, pelvic exams, birth control, and education are its services. These are provided on a sliding fee scale, allowing people without insurance to obtain medical services. High risk pregnancies that result from no prenatal care cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars and much more than funding Planned Parenthood. These services reduce the health care burden on everyone.
1.3. Con: Planned Parenthood empowers women.
1.3.1. Pro: Planned Parenthood provides women with contraception, education and other vital tools that allow women to be more in control of making healthcare decisions that affect their lives.
1.3.2. Pro: 56% of small business owners agreed that having access to contraception was empowering, as it allowed them to advance their[businesses and careers](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-would-happen-if-planned-parenthood-was-defunded-6-frightening-options-2950007) without having to worry about children.
1.4. Pro: Planned Parenthood supports abortions. This should not be funded by the government.
1.4.1. Con: Abortions are necessary healthcare for women- not everyone is able to carry a pregnancy [to term](https://www.politico.com/story/2012/10/medical-experts-say-abortions-still-needed-despite-advances-082640).
1.4.2. Pro: Many US citizens object to abortion.
1.4.2.1. Pro: If you object to abortion, you are free to chose not to have an abortion. The preferences of some citizens should not dictate the choices of others- indeed pro-life Americans appear to now be the [minority.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx)
1.4.3. Con: -> See discussion #5637: Women should have the right to choose abortion.
1.4.4. Pro: If people need abortions, they should pay full price.  It was their fault from the beginning, therefore citizens should not be responsible for it.
1.4.4.1. Con: Taxpayer money does not go towards abortion services.  The Taxpayer money goes towards other services. [npr.org](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/05/429641062/fact-check-how-does-planned-parenthood-spend-that-government-money)
1.4.4.2. Con: There is insufficient evidence on which to base the assumption that all individuals who fall pregnant but don't want to be a parent are at fault for falling pregnant.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Even with the best intentions and preparation, contraceptives can and do fail.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: Even the best contraceptive methods such as surgical sterilisation can fail, and even with perfect use the [pill](http://www.arhp.org/Publications-and-Resources/Quick-Reference-Guide-for-Clinicians/choosing/failure-rates-table) may not work.
1.4.4.2.2. Con: Only a minute amount \([1%](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/psrh/full/3711005.pdf)\) of those who get abortions are raped. The only way to be 100% "safe" from getting a child, is abstinence. If she consensually agreed to have sex, she is at fault, by definition, for becoming pregnant. The report linked above, which is by the research branch of PP, shows plenty of reasons women get one, but pretty much all of them would be unneccessary by just not having sex if they don't want a child \(except 6% of them getting pressured by their parents to get one\).
1.4.4.2.2.1. Con: It is unfair to blame just the women for the creation of a child- men are involved too!
1.4.4.2.2.2. Con: It is unrealistic to expect people to practice abstinence. We know that [teen pregnancy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3194801/) rates notably are higher in places which emphasize abstinence based sex- ed.
1.4.4.2.2.2.1. Con: Unrealistic or not, the consequences of their actions speak for themselves, and should not be possible to dispose of just when it appears inconvenient. They already had the choice to avoid the risk of pregnancy, but chose not to.
1.4.4.3. Con: While people should face the consequences of their actions, in this particular case, there may be an innocent third party involved. If people are unable to abort due to economic reasons, they may continue the pregnancy and have a child the state may need to take care of.
1.4.5. Pro: Abortion is immoral, therefore it should be illegal. If it illegal, PP can rely on donors for money for cheaper contraception.  It eliminates the need for tax dollars.
1.4.5.1. Con: Abortion can be seen as immoral or not Immoral depending on which philosophical ethic that a person follows.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: Deontology, using a maxim of "you should not kill", would always find abortion immoral, even regardless of circumstance.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: Utilitarianism, seeking the greatest happiness, could not disregard the welfare of the fetus. To do otherwise would be the fallacy of sympathy and antipathy.
1.4.5.1.2.1. Con: Life is net suffering for every individual. Therefore, forcing a new individual into existence would increase the total amount of suffering in the world, which is contrary to the goals of utilitarianism.
1.4.5.1.2.1.1. Con: This kind of reasoning actually appears to be able to justify genocide in the sense that it would "reduce" the total amount of suffering in the world because "life is net suffering for every individual."
1.4.5.1.3. Con: Virtue ethics, seeking moral character, would always state abortion is wrong because it builds a habit of disregarding life and human dignity.
1.4.5.1.4. Con: The abortion debate disagrees on facts, not values. No one thinks innocent people should die. The debate is over whether fetus are people. That is a claim of fact, not a claim of value.
1.4.5.2. Con: A woman's right to choose is moral and backed by current US law.
1.4.5.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.4.6. Con: Abortion is a right.  We deserve it for free.
1.4.7. Con: Abortion doesn't require or qualify for government funding. PP performs abortions using private donations and it also charges the patient for this procedure. Abortions aren't performed for free.[plannedparenthood.org](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/ask-experts/how-much-does-an-abortion-cost)
1.4.8. Con: Government funds to PP supports ALL of the other women's health related services except abortion. [Tax payers don't pay for abortions.](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/ask-experts/how-much-does-an-abortion-cost) The client does.
1.4.9. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.4.10. Pro: Abortion should be outlawed.  You should be forced to carry your baby, and can let the baby be adopted if you cannot keep the baby.
1.4.10.1. Con: Adoption is often not a viable option for many women.
1.4.10.1.1. Pro: Many women do not wish to put a child up for [adoption](http://www.arcc-cdac.ca/postionpapers/41-Why-Few-Women-Choose-Adoption.pdf) as they are not prepared to carry a child to full term- they may have health issues, or cannot let people know they were pregnant.
1.4.10.2. Con: Incest, rape, negative side effects from medically prescribed drugs, deformity, mental issues, & child pregnancy are all reasons abortions need to be available to those who need them.
1.4.10.3. Con: No one should be forced to bear [the significant health risks](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-complications.html), time consumption, lifestyle change, and pain that attend pregnancy.
1.4.10.4. Con: Planned Parenthood provides many services other than abortion such as birth control, STD/STI screening, and sexual education.
1.4.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.4.10.5. Con: People should not be forced to do something with their bodies that they don't want to.
1.4.10.5.1. Con: By [choosing to have sex](https://www.kialo.com/planned-parenthood-should-be-defunded-16915/16915.0=16915.1+16915.4-16915.28-16915.72/-16915.72), she ought to take the responsibility for risking pregnancy. She should have thought about not wanting children before making that decision.
1.4.10.5.1.1. Con: Forcing large numbers of individuals to face massive consequences for choosing to have sex is detrimental to freedom of sexual choice.
1.4.10.5.1.1.1. Con: Getting a child is the biological outcome of having sex. That's the reason why it feels good. Humans are programmed to want to reproduce. Choosing to have sex, getting pregnant as a result, and then deciding that the child is unwanted, is deeply irresponsible. People ought to take responsibility for their own actions and its foreseeable consequences.
1.4.10.5.2. Con: Inside the woman's body comes to being a body that is separate from her own. She should not have the right to take another person's life unless it was the result of a rape or her life/health being threatened by carrying out the pregnancy.
1.4.10.6. Con: Personal freedom and bodily autonomy at the heart of any democratic legislation. Forced abortions completely clash with it.
1.4.10.6.1. Con: The bodily autonomy of the child must also be considered.
1.4.10.7. Con: Abortion should remain legal and Planned Parenthood as it stands now should lose government funding. It can regain federal funding on all other services by splitting the abortion services to a separate company, which will remain unfunded by government sources. Abortion should be privately funded by private supporters of the cause, like other charities.
1.4.10.7.1. Con: Due to the Hyde Amendment, Tax payer money already does not go to abortions. [npr.org](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/05/429641062/fact-check-how-does-planned-parenthood-spend-that-government-money)
1.4.10.7.1.1. Con: Yes it does indirectly benefit abortions, as long as all services are provided by the same company. A subsidy for one service funds the entire company's endeavors. The only way to fund services excepting abortions is to separate the companies entirely. It is what the pro choicers really need, and what the pro lifers really need. It is the only rational compromise for either cause.
1.4.10.7.1.2. Con: Regardless, because abortion is immoral and Planned Parenthood commits abortions, we should defund Planned Parenthood because they engage is grossly immoral activities.
1.4.10.8. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.4.11. Pro: There are much more important things to use the tax money on then abortion. Like getting immigrants integrated and getting more teachers Qualified for school.
1.4.11.1. Con: In aggregate, every dollar PP receives saves taxpayers $7 in Medicare costs. [thinkprogress.org](https://thinkprogress.org/u-s-taxpayers-save-7-for-every-dollar-the-government-spends-on-family-planning-8eb5c609401f/#.ql3citd86)
1.4.12. Pro: Federalism is a fundamental thought of the forefathers.  Therefore, abortion should be a state issue.  States that disagree with the funding can vote in a candidate that takes away funding for PP.
1.4.12.1. Con: The right to choose is important enough to be a federal issue so it does not have to depend on what state one lives in.
1.4.12.1.1. Con: Many also consider the right to life as, if not more, important, which is why this debate is so controversial. Because of this controversy, states vary on whether the majority is pro-life or pro-choice. It should therefore be up to the states to decide. If all states believe in and vote for the right to choose, then democracy has spoken. If some does and some doesn't, democracy has spoken. Power to the people.
1.4.12.1.1.1. Con: The [majority](http://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/)of people in the U.S. support the right to choose. Democracy has already spoken.
1.4.12.1.1.1.1. Con: It's not a big majority. It's 57%. Pew also [show](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/views-about-abortion/by/state/) that the states vary on the majority of the different groups. 30 states has a majority in favor, 17 has a majority against. There's even one where it's even, and with many of the others, there isn't a big difference between them.
1.4.12.1.1.2. Con: Some states do not [fairly distribute voting power](https://strongernc.org/states-worst-congressional-gerrymandering-country/).
1.5. Con: De-funding PP would reduce the [funds necessary for the many services it provides](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/facts-figures).
1.5.1. Pro: At least 60% of Planned Parenthood patients rely on public health programs like Medicaid and Title X for their preventive and primary care. If it were [defunded](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/facts-figures), these people would not have healthcare options.
1.5.2. Pro: Planned Parenthood is a leading provider of [HIV](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/facts-figures) management and prevention services, which are vital to America's health.
1.5.3. Pro: Planned Parenthood provide [hormone treatment](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/facts-figures) options for transgender individuals, which are particularly expensive without the support of programmes such as Planned Parenhood.
1.5.4. Pro: Planned Parenthood provides [vaccine clinics](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/facts-figures) which are essential for the management of preventable disease in America.
1.5.5. Pro: Planned Parenthood also provide services that can benefit men, such as [vasectomies.](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/facts-figures)
1.5.6. Pro: The economic cost to society without Planned Parenthood would be higher than the funding it currently receives. Defunding would cost taxpayers more, from a purely financial perspective.
1.5.6.1. Pro: The Brookings Institute estimates that preventing an unwanted pregnancy saves taxpayers an average of $4771. [www.brookings.edu](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-high-cost-of-unintended-pregnancy/). PP estimates they prevent 579,000 unwanted pregnancies. [www-m.cnn.com](https://www-m.cnn.com/2015/08/04/health/planned-parenthood-by-the-numbers/) This is $2.7B in savings to taxpayers. PP receives about $530M in federal funding, and has an entire budget around 1.3B. [www.npr.org](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/05/429641062/fact-check-how-does-planned-parenthood-spend-that-government-money)
1.5.6.2. Pro: The most common service PP provides is STI testing. [www.plannedparenthood.org](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/71/53/7153464c-8f5d-4a26-bead-2a0dfe2b32ec/20171229_ar16-17_p01_lowres.pdf) Early detection drastically reduces total cost to treat the STI an complications, and improves outcomes [stdlabtest.com](http://stdlabtest.com/why-is-early-std-testing-important/) [www.cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00054174.htm) [www.independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/why-its-important-to-get-screened-for-stis-even-if-you-have-no-symptoms-10402313.html)
1.5.6.3. Pro: Legal and accessable abortion procedures has a long-term effect of reducing the crime rate. This has an economic benefit to society. [freakonomics.com](http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/)
1.5.6.4. Pro: Free pregnancy tests and free or subsidized ultrasounds divert hundreds of thousands of women from hospital emergency rooms, which are required by law to provide service and often can't collect payment, resulting in increased medical costs and longer emergency wait times for all.[debt.org](https://www.debt.org/medical/emergency-room-urgent-care-costs/) [www.verywellfamily.com](https://www.verywellfamily.com/how-much-a-pregnancy-test-costs-4111042)
1.5.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.1.
1.5.6.6. Pro: While the burden on taxpayers is minimal, the positive output of that small burden is great, arguably outweighing that burden.
1.6. Con: There are lots of organizations that are publicly funded, even if they don’t serve the same function as, for example, the fire department. It’s part of the society that we are building to create safe and healthy lives for all Americans. Some people don’t have children, but gladly pay taxes for public schools.
1.6.1. Con: Public funding still ought to be utilized effectively on what society is willing to prioritize. In 2018, Gallup showed that America consisted of both [48%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx) pro-life and pro-choice supporters \(supposedly with 4% not taking a stand\). When half of the adult American population generally view abortions negatively, their money should not go to funding something they're against.
1.6.1.1. Con: Under the [Hyde Amendment \(1976\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment), it is illegal in the United States to allocate federal funding to abortions.
1.7. Con: It is beneficial to society as a whole to help provide resources for safe sex, including access to birth control, control of STIs, and access to safe and legal abortions.
1.7.1. Pro: Having access to resources for safe sex better enables people to exercise their human right to sexual choice.
1.7.2. Con: Condoms are cheap already.  People need to buy them themselves.  If they don't, they pay the price and shouldn't have to ask for taxpayers to pay for the mistake.
1.7.2.1. Con: Not all people understand what the function, need, or point of a condom is.
1.7.2.2. Con: Condoms are not always effective.
1.7.2.3. Con: Not all abortions are necessary due to the reckless mistake of not using a condom. Serious health complications, rape and abuse can also be reasons why an abortion may be necessary.
1.7.2.4. Con: Poor people can't afford condoms and it's a human right to have safe sex.  Funding is necessary.
1.7.2.4.1. Con: Condoms are very much cheaper than abortion services. If anything, this argument rather supports moving the funding from abortion services to condoms for those who cannot afford them.
1.7.2.4.2. Con: You've already failed to have "safe sex" when you get in a situation where you have to choose whether or not to have an abortion \(unless in cases of rape, which only accounts for a very small fraction of abortions\). You're just deciding whether you'll rid yourself of the consequences of having "unsafe sex", which is your responsibility to pay for \(because you got yourself into the mess\), not the state through funding by the rest of society.
1.7.2.4.3. Con: Having sex is not a [human right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights).
1.7.2.4.3.1. Pro: Human rights are related to bodily autonomy and personal freedoms and are a tool to guarantee that any human is treated with respect and dignity. Since sex acts that require condoms involve another person, being entitles to sex is in no way a fundamental human right.
1.8. Pro: Planned Parenthood affiliates donate large amounts of money to political campaigns and entities. Setting abortion aside, an organization that benefits from tax payer dollars while its affiliates engage in political campaigning is unethical.[politifact.com](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/05/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-planned-parenthood-gives-millio/)
1.8.1. Con: There are a great many organizations that benefit from government dollars and engage in political campaigning of some sort. Making changes to prevent this has been universally unpopular.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Churches receive special tax benefits, and many endorse candidates or political positions.
1.8.2. Pro: It's how government \(up till this point\) operated. Since [only 40-60% of the voting public typically turns out to vote](http://www.fairvote.org/voter_turnout#voter_turnout_101), special interests and lobbyists have had a veritable field day filling the feds with all kinds of pet projects.
1.9. Pro: Planned Parenthood engages in illegal activities.
1.9.1. Con: The actions of individuals should not be used to gauge the entire organization. Evidence of leadership encouraging or making policy in violation of the law is needed to make a claim like this.
1.9.2. Pro: Undercover videos reveal that Planned Parenthood [sells bodyparts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjxwVuozMnU) of aborted babies, which is illegal under [42 U.S. Code 274e](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/274e).
1.9.2.1. Con: The Harris County DA investigated the matter and cleared PP of any wrongdoing. Further, a grand jury indicted the plaintiff for evidence tampering based on information uncovered in the investigation. [www.cnn.com](https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/25/politics/planned-parenthood-activists-indicted/index.html)
1.9.2.2. Con: [The claim that PP sells body parts is tenuous, if not outright false.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pp-baby-parts-sale/)
1.9.2.2.1. Con: PP appears here to be deflecting some of the major revelations in the video. Exactly how the relationship goes between PP, patient and buyer isn't certain from the interview, but it's clear that PP offers money to the patient for "donating" to the third party \(whom for it costs $30-100 to buy per specimen\). Since it is not the patients "selling", then PP appears to get the money, and offers reimbursement to the patient. Question is, how does PP earn anything by this, and thus why do they do it?
1.9.2.2.1.1. Pro: Mrs. Nucolta even said, "\[PP\] just want to do it in a way that's not perceived as, 'this clinic is selling tissue, this clinic is making money off of this.'" PP tries in the statement to confuse the situation from a "purchase" or "exchange" to a "donation one gets a reimbursement from." How they seem to make it appear differently is through this three-way relationship.
1.9.2.2.1.2. Pro: PP, like other companies, are driven by profits, and would thus not partake in such a schema if they had nothing to gain by it. It's dubious that it's both the orchestrator of the whole scheme and yet only a medium of the exchange not gaining anything by it.
1.9.3. Con: Claims that PP engages in illegal activites has been widely debunked, and the undercover videos were found to be altered. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_2015_undercover_videos_controversy)
