Discussion Title: Should the government provide funding for arts programs?

1. The government should provide funding for arts programs
1.1. Con: If art is self-supported instead of publicly funded, people will create art that is desired by the masses.
1.1.1. Con: Art is much more complex and important to be just a catering service for what people want.
1.2. Pro: The arts improves academic performance in students.
1.2.1. Pro: Arts programs are rampant in private schools and public school pupils should have the same opportunities.
1.2.1.1. Con: Public school pupils should not necessarily recieve all the privileges that private school pupils do. It's the public schools purpose to maximise their pupils education often with another budget than private schools.
1.2.1.2. Con: Private schools having an art program does not mean it is a necessary part of academia.
1.2.1.3. Con: People don't need government funding to make and practice art.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The arts can be established without government funding, as it has been throughout history.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: The arts can be funded by private donations.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Art should be able to draw a large enough audience to be self-sustaining.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: It's not for the sake of sustaining arts audience that it should be taught in school, it's for the sake of the good it does to those given access to it.
1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: Popularity is not the mark of good or valuable art. And with a minority of very high-visibility exceptions, art is almost universally undervalued by the free market. Artists work very hard at their craft and should be compensated for their work.
1.2.1.3.2.2.1. Con: For most products today, consumers choose whether they value the item more than the money they are paying for it, and may choose whether or not to buy it. Artists should be held to the standard of what people actually value their products at, rather than an imagined value of what people should be willing to pay.
1.2.1.3.2.2.2. Con: It is untrue to claim that people are unable to realize for themselves which works of art they most appreciate and which resonate best with them.
1.2.1.3.2.2.3. Con: It is tyrannical to suggest that a group of chosen individuals should choose on behalf of the population which art is best for them, rather than letting them decide for themselves which art they want.
1.2.1.3.2.2.4. Con: The value of anything lies not in how much work went into it but in how much benefit comes out of it.
1.2.1.3.2.3. Pro: People instinctively realize whether a piece of art inspires, enlightens, entertains, or informs them. They seek out art that resonates with them and eschew art which does them no benefit.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: Governments are terrible at increasing the supply of meaningful art.
1.2.1.3.4. Con: National monuments are usually only constructed through government funding.
1.2.1.3.5. Pro: There is no evidence that government funding for the arts is in anyway helpful to the cause of art.
1.2.1.4. Pro: As educational programs become more test-focused, it is crucial to have robust arts programs in schools to make up for things cut from the rest of the curriculum.
1.2.2. Pro: The arts teach things that are not found \(or are found less frequently\) in other subjects, such as divergent thinking, creative problem-solving, focus, etc...\) source: [Americans for the Arts](https://blog.americansforthearts.org/2012/11/26/the-top-10-skills-children-learn-from-the-arts), [National Art Education Association](https://www.arteducators.org/advocacy/articles/116-10-lessons-the-arts-teach)
1.2.3. Pro: The arts reinforce skills in other \(tested\) subjects.
1.2.4. Con: There are many other things that improve academic performance, such as improving memory and asking for help.
1.2.4.1. Con: Having access to a variety of options for improving one's academic performance increases the chances a person will succeed. Thus, the arts should be funded to allow this.
1.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.5.
1.3. Con: Funding from the government will come with restrictions to the types of art artists can create.
1.3.1. Pro: Art recieving funding have an unfair advantage to unfunded art.
1.3.2. Pro: If government funds art, art will become political. Politicians will necessarily need to justify the art. When that happens artists not approved by the mainstream will be marginalised.
1.3.3. Con: The same case could be made regarding scientific funding, but we'd never consider that a reason not to fund scientific programs.
1.3.3.1. Con: The truth is that the impact is not as great since publicly funded and privately funded research rarely compete over their positions. This is not the case for art where for example; paintings containing pink colour receive subsidies. That would lead to more paintings being painted in the colour of pink.
1.3.3.2. Con: You underestimate believers in small government.
1.3.4. Con: That is an assumption - there is nothing requiring an entity to put restrictions on the type of art that can be created.
1.3.5. Pro: If displayed publicly, the government is likely to ban any art that can be seen as derogatory or defamatory, as a way to keep things civil.
1.3.5.1. Con: If government ban any kind of art that is an infringement of free speech.
1.3.5.2. Con: What is seen as derogatory or defamatory is subjective and is left up to interpretation by those viewing or listening to the art.
1.3.6. Pro: Laws codifying the funding will need to define what constitutes as art.
1.3.6.1. Pro: This may leave some arts out of the running for funding.
1.3.7. Pro: People making the funding decisions will end up deciding what art styles or artist will be funded.
1.4. Pro: Arts programs and organizations generate economic activity.
1.4.1. Pro: The arts provide employment opportunities.
1.4.1.1. Con: The arts is not the same as art programs. This claim does not consider the extent of which independent art provide employment opportunities.
1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.4.1.3. Con: This argument can be made for virtually any government spending. But arts funding invariably destroys more employment opportunities through taxes than it will create with spending.
1.4.2. Con: This argument can be made to support virtually any program. The economic activity spurred by arts funding will always be less than the economic activity destroyed by raising taxes.
1.5. Pro: Arts programs are part of a vibrant civil society and are therefore an important part of any democracy.
1.5.1. Con: "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder". Art is subjective in reception, therefore it should be individuals deciding which art projects they wish to support financially, without using comunity resources.
1.5.2. Con: Art can be and is often created without the interference of the government
1.5.2.1. Con: Many forms of art, especially communal art, require time, training, and resources that are unavailable to the majority of people. Without state funding, only the wealthy and a few very lucky "discovered" are able to develop as artists professionally.
1.5.3. Con: Art programs does not equal the art of society. Art programs are a liability that we hope will bring contributions to the art of society.
1.5.4. Pro: Art provides culture to a society, which is just as important as infrastructure.
1.5.4.1. Con: The cultural values of art are subjective, see [Hitler as an artist](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/08/19/hitler-as-artist).
1.5.5. Pro: The arts are a vital part of a city's entertainment sector. Without it, there is less of an attraction point for outsiders to visit.
1.5.5.1. Con: Not all art is produced through art programs. A lot of art is independently developed. Thusly it is false to argue art programs are a major contributor without considering the amount of independent art.
1.5.6. Pro: The arts revitalize troubled neighborhoods.
1.5.6.1. Pro: Providing outlets for creative expression can have a positive effect on those living in neighborhoods where they would be more likely to express themselves through anger, or other seemingly negative means.
1.5.7. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.5.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.7. Pro: Arts promote empathy and understanding.
1.7.1. Con: The National Arts Association describes as a lesson that arts teach "The arts' position in the school curriculum symbolizes to the young what adults BELIEVE is IMPORTANT.". This is not inherently empathetic or understanding. Source: [arteducators.org](https://www.arteducators.org/advocacy/articles/116-10-lessons-the-arts-teach)
1.7.2. Con: Empathy and understanding can be taught in many other ways. The arts are not necessary for this.
1.7.3. Con: In a [study](https://theconversation.com/do-art-and-literature-cultivate-empathy-68478) to measure the effects of literature and the arts on empathy, original findings could not be replicated.
1.7.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.5.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.5.
1.8. Pro: Arts and humanities in general are the best way to keep our humane part, to stay connected with our inner expression and it stops us from becoming robots addicted to technology.
1.8.1. Con: Totalitarian views are disproportionatly distributed amongst social sciences and humanities studies. [econlib.org](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2015/03/the_prevalence_1.html)
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.5.
1.9. Con: The government is in debt and cannot afford it.
1.9.1. Con: It's not a matter of being unable to afford it. The issue is one of willingness to prioritize it.
1.9.2. Pro: By the end of 2018, the [US governmental debt](https://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/) is expected to be $24.58 trillion dollars.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.5.
1.11. Con: If the government funds art, it could use funding to promote propaganda.
1.11.1. Pro: Citizens may object to using tax dollars to support art that contains offensive or objectionable content.
1.11.1.1. Pro: It is immoral to forcibly take someone's money to fund art that then demeans or disparages them. Government funded art has done this and will likely continue to do so. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piss_Christ)
1.11.2. Con: The government could instead fund arts to promote creations that are of benefit to the nation as a whole.
1.11.2.1. Con: When the state desides itself to promote a certain kind of art, that is at the expense of other types of arts. Since art is one of the biggest opinion shapers of society it can be argued that government funding arts that it find suitable is a form of propaganda.
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.
1.12. Con: Government spendings should be effective and efficient. It is extremely difficult to evaluate art projects this way.
