Discussion Title: Masturbation - Is It Acceptable?

1. Masturbation is acceptable
1.1. Con: Masturbation is addictive.
1.1.1. Con: This is true but implies that all potentially addictive behaviours are unacceptable, which is troublesome considering many activities such as internet use or even exercise are potentially addictive.
1.1.2. Pro: This may be due to different factors such as isolation, anxiety or low self-esteem.
1.1.3. Pro: Masturbation to certain sources may train the brain to become aroused more by those sources and less by real life situations or people, resulting in less motivated people who wish to connect with one another.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Masturbating in the perceived safety of one's home to the same source in the same place over time sets up a habit. As this becomes more set, arousal to other different sources or situations is decreased.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Hentai and cartoon porn can promote less arousal to real life persons and situations when used as a frequent masturbation source.
1.1.3.3. Con: Being less aroused could also enable more realistic relationships with others, as the relationship can be driven by things other than one's sex drive.
1.1.4. Con: Addiction is only problematic insofar as the negative consequences of the addictive behavior outweigh the positive consequences of the addictive behavior. It is not clear that the negative consequences of masturbation outweigh the positive consequences \(such as temporary pleasure\).
1.1.5. Con: Addiction is an issue within a person, not the stimulus. Anything can become addictive, depending on the needs of the person.
1.1.6. Pro: Masturbation can affect your time and lifestyle.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Masturbation can be a such a great release for some that they spend good amounts of time focused on it, becoming distracted from their daily responsibilities.
1.1.6.2. Con: So do, for instance, social networks. Yet, they doubtfully will be considered unacceptable.
1.1.6.3. Pro: Masturbation may reduce sex drive.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: Masturbation contributes to sex drive, as the end result is still an orgasm.
1.2. Pro: Masturbation provides pleasure.
1.2.1. Con: There are many activities that bring pleasure to some, like cutting, but are not acceptable.
1.2.1.1. Con: Masturbation isn't an inherently harmful or hazardous activity, unlike cutting.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Masturbation can injure you.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Anyone who is injured by masturbating is [doing it wrong](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/sex/tips/a486/how-to-masturbate-really-well/).
1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Assuming people's pleasure is the criteria of successful masturbation- some people may enjoy a slight \(or intense\) sense of pain as they masturbate despite the resulting injury.
1.2.1.1.1.3. Con: It can be injurious and still provide pleasure.
1.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: Some forms of [masturbation](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=100371), can lead to irritated and inflamed skin, particularly in the genital area.
1.2.1.1.1.4.1. Con: This can occur with masturbating too much. One can know their limits and masturbate without injury.
1.2.2. Pro: A person might feel pleasure knowing they can please themselves without the involvement of another person.
1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.2.4. Pro: Just like sex with a partner, a person can experience a pleasurable orgasm.
1.3. Pro: According to [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/guide/masturbation-guide#1) \(the foremost medical authority on the web\) "masturbation now is regarded as a normal, healthy sexual activity that is pleasant, fulfilling, acceptable, and safe."
1.3.1. Pro: Masturbation is natural and non-injurious. There is no logical reason to discourage it.
1.4. Pro: There are many health benefits to masturbation.
1.4.1. Con: Ever since PornHub and thus the increase in masturbation, erectile dysfunction has increased. [castbox.fm](https://castbox.fm/va/965550)
1.4.2. Con: As the penis is designed to interact with a lubricated vagina, a dry hand may generate harmful friction.
1.4.2.1. Pro: [“Another consequence of many types of friction can be wear, which may lead to performance degradation or damage to components.”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction)
1.4.2.2. Con: Proper lubrication eliminates this concern. Any activity performed poorly can result in injury, even playing a musical instrument.
1.4.3. Pro: Regular masturbation can [decrease](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3072021.stm) a male's risk of prostate cancer.
1.4.4. Pro: There are many heath benefits. For example, it can [reduce anxiety and depression](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/news/a36484/benefits-of-masturbation/).

1.5.1. Con: The act of masturbation is not condemned in the Bible.

1.5.2.1.1. Con: Millenials who are the generation that masturbate the most and have the least sex compared to other generations when they were the same age. [castbox.fm](https://castbox.fm/va/965550)
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: That millenials have the least amount of sex is neither good nor bad.
1.5.2.2. Con: This only means that it is unacceptable to certain groups of society, not the whole, as the original claim of the debate says.
1.5.3. Con: Religious teachings should not control what society as a whole thinks is acceptable.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Everyone does not follow religious faith as doctrine and therefore do not live within the guidelines laid out by these faiths.
1.5.4. Con: Some religions also view it as an acceptable, such as [Lutheranism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_on_masturbation#Lutheranism).
1.6. Con: Masturbation can become a coping mechanism that leaves people with a momentary 'high' but afterwards, less focused and driven to engage with the rest of life.
1.6.1. Con: Masturbation could also be used as a reward after completing a task that gives the high that people feel they deserve.
1.7. Pro: Masturbation is considered normal and is commonly practiced in many countries.
1.7.1. Pro: In the US, a [majority](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/masturbation-habits-infographic/) of the population masturbates. Thus, it is fairly common and normal.

1.7.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.
1.7.2. Con: An act being normal does not qualify that act as being ok. For example, when being racist was considered 'normal'.
1.7.3. Pro: Masturbation is part of sexual development and is present in healthy adult sexual behavior, both with a partner and in solitary.
1.8. Pro: Masturbation is the safest sex alternative.
1.8.1. Con: The 'safest' sex alternative is no sex at all.
1.8.1.1. Con: Masturbation isn't sex, so this does not contradict the claim that masturbation is the safest alternative.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Masturbation is sex with oneself.
1.8.2. Pro: Some doctors agree its a [healthy way](https://www.elitedaily.com/p/should-you-masturbate-before-a-date-a-doctor-says-yes-heres-why-8899323) to avoid hormonal impulses on a first date, essentially keep one safe from making potentially poor decisions.
1.8.3. Pro: Masturbation is a safe alternative for those who want to avoid pregnancy.
1.8.3.1. Pro: The world is over-populated. Masturbation in practice can reduce the amount of people contributing to this problem.
1.8.4. Con: "Although masturbation is the safest sex of all, negative feelings that may be associated with it can threaten one’s individual health and well-being." p.11[\(Masters, Johnson, and Kolodny, 1986\)](http://www.academia.edu/31816625/Masturbation_From_Stigma_to_Sexual_Health).
1.8.4.1. Pro: Especially if there is a 'shame spiral' over masturbating.[experiencelife.com](https://experiencelife.com/article/shutting-shame-down/)
1.8.4.2. Pro: Negative feelings are more likely to occur if masturbating is part of a obsessive/compulsive disorder. Symptoms of this disorder are repeatedly performing behaviors that are so time-consuming that they interfere with an individual’s normal routine, occupational function, social life, and/or personal relationships \(APA, 1994, 417–9\)." pg.11 [academia.edu](http://www.academia.edu/31816625/Masturbation_From_Stigma_to_Sexual_Health)
1.8.4.2.1. Pro: As the interference by compulsive behaviour removes the social effort needed for ordinary sexual pleasure, masturbators are adapting to become less sociable and less connected to the rest of society, possibly resulting in less helpful contribution to society.
1.9. Pro: Masturbation is a way to explore one's body, which every human has a right to do.
1.9.1. Pro: In this way, the person can later explain/show others that they are involved with and what they enjoy- leading to easier and simpler enjoyment.
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.9.3. Pro: Masturbation is an act voluntarily performed by an individual on themselves, with little or no impact on others, and thus should not be regulated legally or socially.
1.10. Pro: Every individual retains a human right to sexual choice- this includes providing oneself sexual pleasure.
1.11. Con: Masturbation may lead to unrealistic sexual expectations.
1.11.1. Con: Masturbation recreates sex within the boundaries of one's own fantasies. Thus, its a way to play out unrealistic expectations in a safe way.
1.11.2. Pro: Masturbating to sources such as pornographic videos and pictures may decrease arousal towards more realistic sexual experiences.
1.11.2.1. Pro: Videos featuring sexual intercourse are more often than not, *designed* to be stimulating for the viewer. With this in mind, the participants may be making more noise or expressing or accepting intimate or crude words to/from their partner than in real-life, which viewers may then expect from real-life.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: This suggests an issue with pornography itself \(some of which is actually much more "ethical" and "realistic," including amateur style\), not with masturbation itself.
1.11.2.2. Con: Masturbation does not require pornography; the ethics of using pornography are a different debate.
1.11.2.2.1. Con: Masturbation often takes place with some sort of stimulus, whether that be internal and imaginary or external  \(such as pornography\). It is therefore useful to discuss masturbation in relationship to these stimuli.
1.11.2.2.1.1. Con: This is an extension fallacy. The overarching claim about masturbation does not involve other stimuli.
1.11.3. Pro: A person may lose their desire for sexual intimacy from another due to the pleasure they can easily provide themselves with visual stimuli.
1.11.3.1. Con: There is nothing wrong with not wanting to be sexually active with another person in real life.
1.11.4. Pro: A person may lose their desire for sexual intimacy from another due to the pleasure they can easily provide themselves with visual stimuli and masturbation.
1.11.4.1. Con: -> See 1.11.3.1.
1.11.4.2. Con: Some individuals already specifically do not wish to be sexual intimate with another person but still desire pleasure.
1.11.5. Con: Multiple sources in mass media also encourage unrealistic expectations of sex and relationships.  These multiple sources in mass media are possibly more influential than the sources used as masturbating material by a smaller part of the population.
