Discussion Title: Should Facebook and Twitter Remove the Accounts of Terrorist Organisations?

1. Facebook and Twitter should remove accounts of terrorist organisations, such as ISIS, from their sites.
1.1. Pro: Facebook and Twitter are legally obliged to delete accounts affiliated with terrorism.
1.1.1. Con: Accounts affiliated with ISIS and other terrorist organizations are protected under the [First Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) to the US Constitution which states that "Congress shall make no law \[...\] abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press."
1.1.1.1. Con: According to a Supreme Court [ruling from 1969](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/case.html), the First Amendment does not protect incitements to imminent lawless action such as violence, which is the main function of many accounts affiliated with ISIS.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Arguing that hateful speech is directly linked to violent action risks equating speech with actions.  This can lead to [chilling effects](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chilling_effect) on speech and government abuse: It could make people think twice before expressing non-mainstream views, since legal acts of speech might be equated with illegal action by the government whenever politically convenient  \([Lidsky, p. 161](http://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1216&context=facultypub)\).
1.1.1.1.2. Con: There is no proof that the hate speech and hashtag campaigns often orchestrated by accounts affiliated with terrorist organisations are "likely to produce" imminent violence as required by the so-called [Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio) test.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Its successful use of social media for propaganda and for [inciting attacks](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/11/19/fight-against-isis-reveals-power-of-social-media/) has been instrumental for the success of ISIS. Accounts affiliated with it can thus be considered an important cause of violent attacks across the world and are not protected by the First Amendment.
1.1.1.2. Con: According to a Supreme Court ruling from 2003, the First Amendment does not protect speech that has an "[intent to intimidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_v._Black)".
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Precedent on which kinds of speech have an intent to intimidate is unclear. For example, a 1977 Supreme Court decision held that the First Amendment [protected a march by the National Socialist Party of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie) through a predominantly Jewish town.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Existing case law indicates that regulation of speech needs to be viewpoint-neutral. For example, speech cannot be regulated because it is "offensive" or "[outrageous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snyder_v._Phelps)", or based on an "[undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District)".
1.1.1.4. Pro: Hateful speech is not the same as violent action and does not hurt anyone directly, it should thus be protected under the First Amendment.
1.1.1.5. Con: First Amendment rights can be restricted if necessary for an [important state interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System,_Inc._v._FCC) such as protecting national security.
1.1.1.6. Con: According to a [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holder_v._Humanitarian_Law_Project) and a [2014](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/09/mehanna_at_the_supreme_court_is_translating_jihad_texts_a_crime.html) Supreme Court case, political speech in support of terror groups can constitute [Material Support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providing_material_support_for_terrorism) for these organisations and thus be exempted from First Amendment protections.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: According to a [2010 Supreme Court case](http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/03/challenging-use-of-advocacy-as-terrorism/), the material support statute can only be applied to someone who coordinates with the relevant terror organisations. This is not the case for Twitter or Facebook.
1.1.2. Con: [Section 230](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act) of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 [protects online services](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/10/11950098/twitter-isis-lawsuit-safe-harbor-terrorism) from liability for speech published on their network.
1.1.2.1. Pro: In [November 2016](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/11/twitter-defeats-isis-material-support-lawsuit-again-fields-v-twitter.htm) and [May 2017,](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/terrorism-victims-cant-hold-facebook-liable-for-hamas-use-of-the-platform/)  two US courts respectively ruled that this law also protects Facebook and Twitter from liability for terrorist content published on their platform.
1.1.2.2. Pro: In the past, Section 230 has been upheld with regard to a broad [range of issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act#Case_law) and the [only exception](https://ilt.eff.org/index.php/Defamation:_CDA_Cases#Section_230_and_Intellectual_Property) to this rule are intellectual property infringements. Thus, the section also protects networks from liability for accounts affiliated with terrorist organisations.
1.1.2.3. Con: Critics have argued that the way Section 230 is currently interpreted defeats its original purpose and should thus be updated.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Some critics argue that Section 230 has been [interpreted too favourably](http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1545&context=fclj) for Internet service providers and should be amended to include e.g. liability enabling sexual exploitation of children.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Section 230 was meant to create a space where [new platforms could grow and experiment](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-law-that-gave-us-the-modern-internet-and-the-campaign-to-kill-it/279588/) without impediments and thus contribute to the US economy. However, platforms like Facebook or Twitter have long ceased being fragile young startups and could easily bear the cost of taking more responsibility for the content hosted on their websites.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Facebook turns a [profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) of more than $1 billion every year.
1.1.2.3.2.2. Con: Twitter is actually [struggling](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-results-metrics-idUSKBN15O2ZB) to become a profitable venture. Adding a significant new legal and thus financial burden might shut down the platform for good.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: Section 230 is based on the assumption that platforms are neutral intermediaries that simply host their users' content. However, given the influence platforms have on [which content](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/opinion/the-real-bias-built-in-at-facebook.html) their users actually see, this assumption clearly does not reflect reality anymore.
1.1.2.3.3.1. Pro: All tech companies have [political biases](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/course-facebook-biased-thats-tech-works-today/) that are perpetuated in their algorithms.
1.1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: It is a common misperception that algorithms are somehow rational. In reality, they can best be understood as [sets of rules determined by humans](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/upshot/when-algorithms-discriminate.html) - and since humans are irrational and biased, they often reproduce these biases when writing code.
1.1.2.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: For instance, if programmers are liberals in US politics, they might be inclined to classify liberal media as credible sources, while not doing so for sources like Breitbart or Fox News. If they write an algorithm that is meant to show users more credible news sources, such an algorithm would perpetuate a pro-liberal and anti-conservative bias in their timelines.
1.1.2.3.3.1.2. Con: Algorithms are mere mathematical functions and therewith not biased in themselves.
1.1.2.3.3.1.3. Pro: If the information used to [calibrate an algorithm](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601775/why-we-should-expect-algorithms-to-be-biased/) is [biased](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kH-P9xGy6LoJ:https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/artificial-intelligence-sea-dudes-problem/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us), this bias is reproduced in the algorithm.
1.1.2.3.4. Con: Given the enormous costs of thoroughly eliminating all accounts associated with terror organisations, even large corporations like Twitter and Facebook still deserve the protection of Section 230. Otherwise, they would not be able to concentrate on their core tasks anymore.
1.1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Eliminating all accounts linked to terror organisations would be burdensome for both Twitter and Facebook.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1. Pro: Eliminating terrorist accounts would be technically difficult for both Facebook and Twitter.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.1. Con: ISIS' social media accounts are managed by a relatively small and manageable group of [between 500 and 2,000](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/isis_twitter_census_berger_morgan.pdf) individual users.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: Terrorist accounts are close to impossible to identify before some revealing information is posted. Wiping them out before something can be posted would require to screen nearly all users.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Algorithms have been developed for Twitter that can efficiently predict new extremist users prior to posting content as well as identify the new accounts of previously suspended users. Applying these would significantly lessen the burden placed on Twitter's staff and its users to identify terrorist content [\(Klausen, Marks, and Zaman, p. 36\)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06242.pdf).
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.2.2. Con: Terrorist accounts are harmless before they have posted any information. Waiting until that happens is not a problem.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: Facebook and Twitter have to hire a large number of staff to develop artificial intelligence and fight terror organisations online, which will be very costly. For instance, specialised anti-terrorism moderators are usually based in countries like the US, where median yearly income is [$30,240](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States), or [Ireland](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/04/conor-mcgregor-floyd-mayweather-fight-paulie-malignaggi), where average yearly salaries are [37,000€](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_average_wage).
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: Facebook hired [150 developers](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40290258) to improve the AI so that it can identify terrorist content.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: Facebook and Twitter need to hire more moderators to fight terrorism effectively. Just recently Facebook hired [3000](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/05/24/terrorists-can-easily-bypass-facebook-censorship-leaked-documents/) new moderators to fight terrorism on its page.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.3.3. Con: Facebook often outsources moderators to providers such as [PRO Unlimited](https://www.inverse.com/article/31130-facebook-live-murder-moderators-part-time-contractors) or [oDesk](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/9118778/The-dark-side-of-Facebook.html). This makes these moderators substantially cheaper, as it allows Facebook to circumvent labor laws in the US and hire cheap and flexible part-time workers in other countries.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.3.3.1. Con: The moderation of terrorist content requires special expertise and training, so it cannot simply be outsourced like more basic tasks.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Terrorist content is not comparatively more difficult. Facebook has equal problems to find the right balance with regard to [child pornography](http://fortune.com/2017/03/07/facebook-child-pornography/).
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: In order to effectively identify terrorist content posted by Indonesian users, the messenger app Telegram had to create a dedicated team of people familiar with [Indonesian politics and culture](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/16/telegram-blocks-terror-content-after-indonesia-threatens-ban.html).
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.4. Con: Creating a [database](http://nypost.com/2017/03/01/facebook-accepts-blood-money-from-terrorist-activities-lawsuits/) that compares terrorist posts and automatically deletes them, as is done with child porn, is a simple and cost-effective method to handle terrorist content.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft established such a database in [2016](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-counterterrorism-idUSKBN1962F8) and in Europe the AI deletes matching posts automatically.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.4.2. Con: In the case of child pornography, content can be easily matched and deleted because it takes the form of images and videos. Automated tools can very easily compare groups of pixels to identify duplicates, but doing so for text is incredibly difficult as it requires computers to understand the semantics of a message. Automatic matching against a database of content is much less likely to be effective in the case of terrorism.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, Facebook is already working to improve its algorithm in areas more complex than simple image matching, for example [language understanding](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/06/how-we-counter-terrorism/).
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.4.2.2. Con: Terror propaganda on social media has a strong audiovisual focus and is primarily based on the dissemination of photos and videos, so image matching is exactly the right tool for combatting it.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.4.2.3. Pro: Matching patterns and even objects between images is a task that technology is now capable of [performing to the level of a monkey](https://www.wired.com/2014/07/cadieu/) — which is more than enough to establish similarities between two images. Yet [advances in natural language processing have been much slower](https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/the-two-paths-from-natural-language-processing-to-artificial-intelligence-d5384ddbfc18) and find higher-level meanings difficult to parse.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.5. Con: Facebook identifies about [1300](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/05/24/terrorists-can-easily-bypass-facebook-censorship-leaked-documents/) terrorist posts per month but only deletes around 300. More stringent moderation guidelines are an easy way to fight terrorism online.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.6. Pro: Terrorist organizations can easily replace blocked accounts with new ones with fake names.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.6.1. Pro: Even if Facebook demands an official ID, these are not currently difficult to acquire.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: A reporter got an [official ID](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3235320/PASSPORT-TERROR-MailOnline-reporter-buys-Syrian-papers-sold-ISIS-fighters-sneaking-Europe-hidden-refugees.html) for as little as $2000.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.6.2. Con: One Twitter-based study found that even after a suspended account returned and was not immediately re-suspended, user activity decreased and rarely reached its previous heights. So although new accounts can be created, suspension/deletion clearly has a positive effect on curbing online terrorist activities [\(Berger, p. 9\)](https://cchs.gwu.edu/sites/cchs.gwu.edu/files/downloads/Berger_Occasional%20Paper.pdf).
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.1.2.1.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.6.4. Con: Even if terror organisations could replace accounts at the same rate that they are deleted, this would at least take time, attention and other resources away from their other social media activities.
1.1.2.3.4.1.1.7. Pro: The terrorist organisations could have the cleverness to avoid specific language that algorithms and AI could understand, they could use coded phrases, so this measure would not effectively stop or slow down terrorist organisations.
1.1.2.3.4.1.2. Con: Facebook and Twitter also ban other accounts. This did not hurt their business model either.
1.1.2.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: Facebook and Twitter delete content that is considered illegal already, e.g. [revenge porn](https://www.bustle.com/p/facebook-is-fighting-revenge-porn-with-these-important-new-tools-49513), [copyright infringements](https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2012/10/05/facebook-confirms-it-shut-down-the-cool-hunters-facebook-page-over-copyright-infringement/) or [hate speech](http://time.com/4150296/facebook-google-hate-speech-germany/).
1.1.2.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: Facebook deletes many fake news accounts, e.g. in [France](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/13/facebook-cracks-down-on-30000-fake-accounts-in-france.html).
1.1.2.3.4.1.3. Pro: Blocking terrorist accounts requires asking users to look for and report accounts they notice or interact with.
1.1.2.3.4.1.3.1. Con: There are groups of social activists and "hacktivists" who do this willingly, thus it is not putting an unwanted burden on anyone.
1.1.2.3.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: The infamous hacking collective [Anonymous](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/13/anonymous-hackers-islamic-state-isis-chan-online-war/) has been waging an online war against ISIS, during which they have dismantled hundreds of ISIS-linked websites and flagged well over 100,000 Twitter accounts.
1.1.2.3.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: Other social media sites have capitalized on this phenomenon; for example, YouTube has [deputized](http://www.popsci.com/terror-on-twitter-how-isis-is-taking-war-to-social-media) some human-rights groups as “trusted flaggers” to identify ISIS content. Facebook and Twitter could similarly delegate these duties to willing third parties.
1.1.2.3.4.1.3.2. Pro: Although Twitter uses proprietary spam-fighting tools to supplement the identification of extremist accounts, the majority of account identification is based on reports
from its users [\(Klausen, Marks, and Zaman, p. 2\)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06242.pdf).
1.1.2.3.4.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.1.2.1.
1.1.2.3.4.1.3.4. Con: These sites have been increasingly working to create alternatives to user policing. [For example](https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-terrorist-propaganda-still-a-challenge-for-tech-companies-1496712112?mg=prod/accounts-wsj), Twitter said internal technology flagged 74% of the 376,890 accounts it suspended for promoting terrorism between July-December 2016.
1.1.2.3.4.1.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.1.2.1.
1.1.2.3.4.1.4. Pro: Eliminating terrorist accounts would be costly for Facebook and Twitter.
1.1.2.3.4.1.4.1. Pro: A harsh crackdown could cost social media platforms users.
1.1.2.3.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: Facebook is already being harshly criticised by [the](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/02/05/facebook-censorship-and-the-war-on-free-speech/) [right](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/435185/facebooks-war-conservative-free-speech) for deleting conservative content and for [attacking freedom of speech](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/insider/why-i-quit-twitter-and-left-behind-35000-followers.html). Other societal groups are likely to follow suit if it starts deleting other content.
1.1.2.3.4.1.4.1.2. Pro: One of the main reasons people leave Twitter is not finding what they consider [useful information](https://qz.com/191524/why-people-quit-twitter/). Deleting content is likely to exacerbate this development.
1.1.2.3.4.1.4.2. Con: Twitter's [revenues](https://ycharts.com/companies/TWTR/revenues) have not changed significantly over the past years although it already deletes accounts with terrorist content. In fact, moderating abusive content was cited as [reason](http://www.businessinsider.de/twitter-reports-q1-earnings-results-2017-4?r=US&IR=T) for why Twitter had a higher than expected growth.
1.1.2.3.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: As of August 2016, Twitter had already shut down over 360,000 ISIS-related accounts [\(Klausen, Marks, and Zaman, p. 2\)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06242.pdf).
1.1.2.3.4.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.1.3.
1.1.2.3.4.1.4.4. Con: These sites are already creating new and more cost effective methods for removing terrorist content. For instance, 74% of the 376,890 accounts suspended by Twitter for promoting terrorism between July and December 2016 were [flagged by internal technology](https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-terrorist-propaganda-still-a-challenge-for-tech-companies-1496712112?mg=prod%2Faccounts-wsj).
1.1.2.3.4.1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.1.2.1.
1.1.2.3.4.1.5. Con: Removing terror organisations' accounts is a burden Facebook and Twitter can carry.
1.1.2.3.4.1.5.1. Pro: Facebook and Twitter are mature companies and can handle losses incurred.
1.1.2.3.4.1.5.2. Pro: Facebook has shown a remarkable [stable growth](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/) of accounts with no significant downturn in growth rates. It does not look like too much of a problem to lose a few terrorist accounts.
1.1.2.3.4.1.6. Con: Facebook and Twitter are moving into the direction of removing accounts already.
1.1.2.3.4.1.6.1. Pro: Facebook is removing content of terrorist organizations in [Europe](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40290258) already. Extending this to specific accounts is not a big step further.
1.1.2.3.4.1.6.1.1. Con: Blocking accounts is considerably different from removing content. Blocked users cannot reengage while users whose content was removed can post it again.
1.1.2.3.4.1.6.1.2. Pro: If an account only posts content that will be removed this is equal to a blocked account.
1.1.2.3.4.1.6.2. Pro: Twitter deletes terror accounts at an [increasing rate](http://myfox8.com/2017/03/23/twitters-purging-terror-accounts-at-a-dizzying-rate-tmwsp/): in the second half of 2016 they deleted more than three times the number of accounts that they had deleted in previous years.
1.1.2.3.4.1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.4.2.1.
1.1.2.3.4.1.6.4. Con: Just because an action is already underway does not mean that it should necessarily continue.
1.1.2.3.4.2. Pro: Thoroughly deleting all accounts affiliated with terror organisations requires heavy surveillance of user activity, which can lead to [chilling effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect).
1.1.2.3.4.2.1. Pro: Given that there are a lot of grey areas and that determining an account's degree of affiliation with a terror organisation is a judgement call, users might restrict their activity online out of fear of having their accounts deleted.
1.1.2.3.4.2.2. Con: If deleting certain accounts also leads to less extremist propaganda being spread on Facebook and Twitter overall, these chilling effects are a good thing.
1.1.2.3.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.3.4.
1.1.2.3.5. Pro: In Europe, platforms are already being held responsible for the content they host, e.g. through court rulings such as the so-called "[right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten)", and this has not led to their demise.
1.1.2.3.6. Con: Whether Section 230 is being interpreted correctly is up to the courts and they have [consistently](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/11/twitter-defeats-isis-material-support-lawsuit-again-fields-v-twitter.htm) [defended](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2017/06/section-230-protects-googles-decision-not-to-de-index-content-bennett-v-google.htm) [platforms'](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2017/03/section-230-protects-grindr-from-harrassed-users-claims-herrick-v-grindr.htm) [exemption](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/03/big-win-for-free-speech-online-in-backpage-lawsuit-forbes-cross-post.htm) from liability.
1.1.2.3.7. Con: Any changes to Section 230 would effectively encourage content hosters to act as censors. This is politically and socially undesirable.
1.1.2.3.8. Con: Holding platforms responsible for the content they host would stifle innovation since small, up and coming platforms [do not have the resources](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-law-that-gave-us-the-modern-internet-and-the-campaign-to-kill-it/279588/) to actively police everything that happens on their websites.
1.1.2.3.8.1. Pro: Such a policy would unfairly advantage big companies that can afford to hire large groups of lawyers and effectively eliminate the fair competition of a free market.
1.1.2.3.8.2. Con: If such a policy can save lives by lowering the number of terror attacks, this would be worth having slightly less innovation.
1.1.2.3.8.2.1. Con: The actual danger of dying from terrorism tends to be vastly exaggerated, especially in the [US](https://qz.com/898207/the-psychology-of-why-americans-are-more-scared-of-terrorism-than-guns-though-guns-are-3210-times-likelier-to-kill-them/) or [Europe](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nice-attack-do-you-feel-like-youre-more-likely-than-ever-to-be-hit-by-a-terror-attack-this-is-why-a7140396.html), so it is questionable whether this policy would actually save any lives and if so, whether that number would be meaningful.
1.1.2.3.8.2.1.1. Pro: Between 2005 and 2015, only 94 US Americans died in terrorist attacks, while 301.797 were [shot](https://qz.com/898207/the-psychology-of-why-americans-are-more-scared-of-terrorism-than-guns-though-guns-are-3210-times-likelier-to-kill-them/). Consequently, innovation leading to stricter gun laws might for example save many more lives than combatting terror organisations online.
1.1.2.3.8.2.1.2. Con: While dying from terrorists may be low risk in the US and in Europe, the same cannot be said for the Middle East where the majority of the fighting occurs. Terror organizations like ISIS would be able to recruit more fighters without this policy.
1.1.2.3.8.2.1.2.1. Pro: Terror incidents are mostly [located](https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism/) in the Middle East, Pakistan and Somalia.
1.1.2.3.8.2.1.2.2. Pro: Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria,Pakistan and Syria account for 75% of terror deaths \([GTI, p. 4](http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2016.2.pdf)\).
1.1.2.3.8.2.1.3. Pro: Only the years [1998 to 2006](https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism/) saw a a marked increase in terror incidents. Before and after the number was low.
1.1.2.3.8.2.2. Con: The link between holding online platforms legally responsible for terrorist content and saving lives is tenuous. Technological innovation, on the other hand, is projected to save a significant number of lives, e.g. through [remote medicine](https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/oct/21/technology-key-saving-lives-thousands-medicine).
1.1.2.3.8.2.3. Pro: If only some of the tens of [thousands of people](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2016/11/18/countries-most-affected-by-terrorism/#32a0010d30d9) killed in terror attacks every year can be saved, there is a moral obligation to do so.
1.1.2.3.8.3. Pro: For smaller platforms, such as [Kialo](https://www.kialo.com/), this would not be possible as they lack the ability to police everything on their website.
1.1.3. Con: Legislation limiting freedom of speech is a sensitive issue in US politics. Previous attempts at creating some legal obligation to combat terrorist speech online more effectively such as the Combat Terrorist Use of [Social Media Act of 2015](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2517) have all [failed](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr3654).
1.1.4. Pro: A number of countries have laws against terrorist content online. Since they are accessible worldwide, Twitter and Facebook need to comply with these laws.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Germany has strict anti-hatespeech laws that [criminalise "incitement to hatred"](http://cco.ndu.edu/News/Article/780274/chapter-13-recruitment-and-radicalization-the-role-of-social-media-and-new-tech/) and recently introduced [high fines for social media platforms](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/06/30/germany-fine-facebook-youtube-50m-fail-delete-hate-speech/) that do not effectively combat hatespeech. Both of these laws could be used to justify deleting accounts linked to terror organisations.
1.1.4.2. Pro: The [UK and France](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-france-may-idUSKBN1942XJ) are in the middle of developing stricter laws combatting terrorist content online. Among other things, the UK government has [threatened to fine](http://news.sky.com/story/britain-and-france-vow-to-stamp-out-evil-online-extremism-10913864) social media companies that do not become more active in removing terrorist content.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Legal reasons aside, commercial interests compel Twitter and Facebook to comply with local laws since they would like to continue operating globally.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Although contradictory to its stated principles of openness, Facebook has been accused of bowing to [government pressure in Thailand](http://mashable.com/2017/05/09/facebook-thailand-censorship/#O282YP5yikqn) and censoring certain posts.
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: Governments can exert pressure on Facebook and Twitter by threatening to block them if they do not comply with local laws.
1.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Nondemocratic countries \(including [China](https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/28/6859993/instagram-reportedly-blocked-in-mainland-china-following-hong-kong-protests), [Turkey](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/facebook-twitter-whatsapp-turkey-erdogan-blocked-opposition-leaders-arrested-a7396831.html), [Russia](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tecnent-wechat-russia-idUSKBN18204J) and [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Iran)\) regularly block websites for not complying with local laws or hosting content incompatible with the ruling government's views.
1.1.4.3.3. Con: Facebook and Twitter are powerful commercial actors that can stand up to government pressure if they decide to do so.
1.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: In Brazil, Facebook-owned WhatsApp has for years [refused to hand over](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-vice-president-latin-america-arrested-brazil-diego-dzoda-a6907291.html) information demanded as part of criminal investigations.
1.1.4.3.3.2. Pro: After being heavily criticised for its involvement with US intelligence services, [Twitter publicly announced](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/13/why-twitter-chose-to-do-battle-with-the-cia.html) it would not let the CIA access its users' information any longer.
1.1.4.3.3.3. Pro: Twitter rejected to share information of users who shared anti-Semitic content in [France](https://gigaom.com/2013/03/27/why-twitter-is-doing-the-right-thing-by-refusing-to-identify-users-who-posted-anti-semitic-comments/).
1.1.4.3.3.4. Pro: Twitter [identified](https://gigaom.com/2012/05/08/twitter-were-still-the-free-speech-wing-of-the-free-speech-party/) itself as "free speech wing of the free speech party". Cooperation with the intent to cut down free speech is unlikely.
1.1.4.3.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.6.2.
1.1.4.3.3.5. Con: Facebook and Twitter are not the correct actor to make the definitional judgement calls on who counts as a terror organisation.
1.1.4.3.3.5.1. Pro: If someone is categorised as a terror organisation, they effectively also lose the right to freedom of speech. Tech executives lack the political legitimacy to make such important decisions, they should only be made by political representatives.
1.1.4.3.3.5.1.1. Con: Since there is no world government, there are no political representatives who do have the legitimacy to make such far-reaching decisions for two global platforms.
1.1.4.3.3.5.2. Con: With almost [2 billion](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/01/technology/facebook-earnings/index.html) and [319 million](https://www.recode.net/2017/2/9/14558890/trump-twitter-user-growth) users respectively, more people voluntarily subject themselves to decisions made by Twitter and Facebook than those of any government.
1.1.4.3.3.5.2.1. Con: Facebook is a business, and allowing them to determine what content is and isn't allowed sets a dangerous precedent. Individuals signing up for Facebook likely didn't consider these potential ramifications the platform could hold in the future, rendering their voluntary association poor evidence. For example, look to the outrage over [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html), a very real possibility that very few people foresaw.
1.1.4.3.3.5.2.2. Con: With the widespread of capitalism and as a result materialism, it's easy to see why people would volunteer for a free way to stay connected, especially with facebook having spent the majority of it's time in good public standing.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3. Con: Governments all around the world publish lists of officially designated terror organisations. Facebook and Twitter can base their decisions on those lists and delete accounts affiliated with any organisation on those lists.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.1. Con: Since Facebook and Twitter are legally registered in the US, only US law should be applied to them.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.1.1. Pro: If Twitter or Facebook have no company representative in a given country, it is impossible to hold them liable for not complying with local laws.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Brazilian courts have long tried to legally hold WhatsApp accountable for not complying with court orders as part of a criminal proceedings. This has been a complicated and messy process, at one point leading to the arrest of a Facebook executive, since WhatsApp itself does not have a [legal representative on Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/01/brazil-police-arrest-facebook-latin-america-vice-president-diego-dzodan). To public knowledge, the Brazilian government has been unsuccessful so far.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.1.2. Pro: According to the [two main theories](https://hbr.org/2006/10/the-rise-of-corporate-nationality) of corporate nationality, a company's nationality is either defined by its place of incorporation or its main seat of business. Under both of these definitions, Twitter and Facebook are US companies.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.1.3. Con: US-based Internet companies are already forced to comply with non-US laws under existing jurisprudence.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: In 2014, a German court ruled that Facebook had to comply with [German data protection laws](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2098720/facebook-must-comply-with-german-data-protection-law-court-rules.html) despite its EU headquarter being located in Ireland.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.1.3.2. Pro: In 2000, a French court decided that Yahoo! had to [comply with French laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LICRA_v._Yahoo!) when it distributed content to French users, regardless of where the company was based.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: The French court ruled that it [had jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LICRA_v._Yahoo!#Competence_of_the_French_court) because the content in question was accessible in France, violated French law, while Yahoo! was aware of French users accessing it.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: US courts later ruled that the French court's decision only applied to France and [could not be enforced in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LICRA_v._Yahoo!#Proceedings_in_the_United_States), thus reinforcing the idea of different regulatory regimes for users in different countries.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2. Con: Complying with the laws of every single country where Twitter and Facebook are accessible would be impractical.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.1. Con: Using geolocation and the [wealth of information](https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2017/04/26/ever-wonder-what-facebook-knows-about-you-heres-how-to-find-out/) Twitter and Facebook possess about their users, it would be easy for them to apply different regulatory regimes based on the jurisdiction users are based in.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: Facebook uses a [specific combination](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/facebook-pride-reaction/531633/) of users' interests and their location to decide whether they can use "Pride" reacts.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.1.2. Pro: [Facebook](http://www.dw.com/en/countries-with-the-most-blocks-on-facebook-content/a-36023902) and [Twitter](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170927) already geo-block or withhold content in France and Germany to comply with national laws.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.2. Pro: Facebook and Twitter sell inherently global rather than regionalised products - no matter whether someone uses the platform in German or in Bahasa Melayu, they all have access to the same content and can follow the same people.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.2.1. Pro: The inherently global nature of multinational companies makes it effectively impossible to only apply EU laws to EU customers. As a result, many multinational companies have restructured their whole business to comply with [EU privacy laws](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106574949477122300).
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.2.2. Con: Facebook has been accused of cooperating with governments in [Israel](https://theintercept.com/2016/09/12/facebook-is-collaborating-with-the-israeli-government-to-determine-what-should-be-censored/), [Russia](https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/22/7433277/facebook-blocks-alexei-navalny-protest-page-russia-putin) and [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/technology/facebook-censorship-tool-china.html) to censor content these government did not want to be accessible in their respective countries.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.3. Pro: Due to the high costs associated with complying with specific regulations for every single country they operate in, multinational companies often produce one product for every region based on the strictest regulations that exist in that particular region.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.3.1. Pro: This so-called "California effect", whereby strict regulation in one jurisdiction may lead to a race to the top around it, can e.g. be observed in [environmental regulation](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/135017697344064?journalCode=rjpp20) and [emission standards](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/PERKINSR/JEPP_California%20effect_Autos_main_identified.pdf).
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.2.1.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.3.3. Pro: Car manufactures in the US produce only one variant of each model that is compliant with Californian emission standards. These are the strictest in the country.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.3. Con: Showing users different content based on their geolocation or country of origin would undermine Twitter's and Facebook's nature as open and transnational platforms.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.3.1. Con: Facebook and Twitter already show filtered content. Adding a geographic location as an important variable in the algorithm is no unknown approach. [Google](http://www.webpresencesolutions.net/7-reasons-google-search-results-vary-dramatically/), for example, provides results based on location.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.1.1.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.3.2. Con: Yes, it would undermine the open nature of Facebook and the internet. But that blame for this should fall on the shoulders of those specific countries and their political processes that created these policies.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4. Con: Since there is [no internationally agreed upon definition](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/defining-terrorism-in-international-law-9780199295975?cc=us&lang=en&) of terrorism, countries can exploit the concept to label political opponents as 'terrorists'.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.1. Pro: The Tibetan government in exile and Tibetan independence activists are considered [separatist agitators](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tibet-idUSKBN16H0RB) by the Chinese government, but freedom fighters by others. The Chinese government could plausibly argue that they qualify as a terror organisation that would need to be combated online.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.2. Pro: The [Gülen Movement](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36855846) \(known as "Hizmet" in Turkish\) was designated a [terrorist organisation](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-gulen-idUSKCN0YM167) by the Turkish government, but is considered simply a civic or religious movement by most other countries.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3. Con: Organisations like ISIS are an exception in that they fundamentally challenge the basis of the international order. Hence, it is clearly in the interest of every single nation state to combat them.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.1. Con: ISIS is simply a modern repetition of old patterns: its basic propaganda and military strategy are comparable to that of many other [insurgent guerrilla movements](http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/523/html) such as the Chinese communists during the Chinese Civil War.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2. Con: Nation building was and often still is an inherently repressive project that disadvantages minorities, and should be challenged.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: During the Turkish nation state building project, sizeable and established non-Muslim minorities such as Jews and Greeks were [not accepted](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870701491937?src=recsys&journalCode=rers20) as part of the new Turkish society.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.2. Pro: Nations are [imagined communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_community) that can only exist because they are based on a broad notion of an ingroup that is defined against an [outgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups). Hence, the process of nation building is inherently exclusionist.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.3. Pro: In Myanmar, the ongoing contention over who can legitimately claim being a citizen has led to [violent internal conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Myanmar) and the oppression of particularly vulnerable minority groups like the [Rohingya](https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21654124-myanmars-muslim-minority-have-been-attacked-impunity-stripped-vote-and-driven).
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4. Con: Nation-building is often constructed using geographic borders, rather than majoritarian identities, to define the outgroup. Doing so means that nationalism is focused on the differences between that country and other ones, rather than the process of exacerbating divisions within a country that often ends up excluding minority identities.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.1. Pro: States often develop distinct national identities by focusing on values that appeal across ethnic divisions such as sport or historic events.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: For example New Zealand emphasises its rugby prowess to differentiate itself from Australia and to present a wider cultural narrative of punching above its weight.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.1.2. Pro: For example, post-apartheid South Africa emphasised its rugby team as a point of national pride that symbolised the nation’s embrace of multiculturalism.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.1.2.1. Con: It is easy to celebrate symbols in isolated instances, but South Africa is no unified, multicultural utopia. Instead, it is based on a deeply colonial history, where people continue to [perpetuate racist tropes](https://academic.oup.com/afraf/article/111/445/551/47260) from the Apartheid era and black South Africans are clearly disadvantaged on a [socioeconomic level](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/06/chart-of-the-week-how-south-africa-changed-and-didnt-over-mandelas-lifetime/).
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.2. Pro: At the time of its founding Singapore was demographically similar to Malaysia but developed a separate, and much more [tolerant](http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/the-race-issue-how-far-has-singapore-come), identity through national education programs that emphasised multiculturalism \(e.g. by teaching in English\).
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.2.1. Con: Despite this multicultural ideal, in reality, [Chinese Singaporeans](http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/the-race-issue-how-far-has-singapore-come) remain the [dominant majority](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-respect-all-races-but-racism-still-an-issue-survey) and there is still [discrimination](https://qz.com/768706/the-racist-reality-of-house-hunting-in-singapore-sorry-your-wife-is-indian/) against ethnic minorities.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.3. Pro: Even if nation states have different political systems, the current international order is based on the agreement that its basic units are sovereign nation states whose territory is inviolable. ISIS' attempt at establishing an Islamic caliphate is a fundamental challenge to this widely agreed upon order \([Krasner, p. 59](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/problematic-sovereignty/9780231505413), [Bartelson, p. 210](https://books.google.de/books/about/A_Genealogy_of_Sovereignty.html?id=yokespTH2G4C&redir_esc=y)\).
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.3.1. Pro: The current international order is largely based on the respect for [states' territory](http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/). ISIS is based on [transnational ideology and practice](http://www.e-ir.info/2014/08/21/the-islamic-states-challenge-to-the-international-system/) aimed at undermining this fundamental organising principle.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.3.2. Pro: ISIS challenges existing borders in the Middle East, which [nationalist movements](http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/isis-and-world-order-139021644) used as the basis of their fight for political independence.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.3.3. Con: The international order can change and is already doing so with the consent of many of its members. This is evidenced by the creation of transnational entities like the European Union.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.4. Con: There are cases where there is widespread agreement that a specific organisation is a 'terror organisation'. For [example](http://www.globalresearch.ca/muslim-leaders-worldwide-condemn-isis/5397364), the Arab league, the Vatican, or Nahdlatul Ulama, one of the largest Islamic organisations, condemn ISIS.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.4.1. Con: Even global unity can be a unreliable metric for determining who counts as a terrorist, since the majority is not necessarily in the right.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: During the era of decolonisation, the dominant narrative perpetuated by colonial powers cast most national liberation movements as terrorists. Nowadays, they are celebrated as heroes.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.5. Con: Oppressive regimes will always label political opponents as “terrorists” — removing social media accounts selectively draws attention to which regimes have legitimate claims and which do not.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.5.1. Con: Even if this attention is created, it is ultimately ineffectual. For instance, extensive reporting on Twitter's compliance with Turkish government demands for censorship has not done anything to undermine it. On the contrary, [it has gotten worse](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/twitter-censorship-journalists-turkey-coup/).
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.5. Con: This would be a questionable way of defining terror organisations since it would enable individual governments, democratic and authoritarian alike, to censor the Internet and undermine freedom of expression all over the world. They would simply need to designate an entity as a terror organisation and all their accounts would be deleted entirely.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.6. Pro: This means that it doesn't matter if it is within the ability of Facebook and Twitter to define 'terror organisation'.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.7. Pro: Facebook and Twitter do not have a 'terror definition unit' and, so far, follow what states would classify as 'terror organization'. Facebook blocks content according to [French law](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/09/french-law-blocking-terrorist-and-child-abuse-sites-comes-into-effect) for example.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.7.1. Con: Facebook and Twitter do not uncritically follow the laws of every single country they operate in.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.7.1.1. Pro: One of the reasons [Twitter](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/168607/20160706/twitter-is-banned-in-china-so-how-does-it-have-10-million-users-there.htm) is blocked in [China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinas-scary-lesson-to-the-world-censoring-the-internet-works/2016/05/23/413afe78-fff3-11e5-8bb1-f124a43f84dc_story.html?utm_term=.f67f8880a087), North Korea and Iran is that the company refuses to censor content according to the will of these countries' governments.
1.1.4.3.3.5.3.7.2. Pro: In Turkey, Twitter follows even questionable laws and [blocks content extensively](https://www.buzzfeed.com/burcukarakas/how-turkey-became-the-top-censor-of-twitter-accounts-worldwi?utm_term=.kqDYNgqx6#.dl74oKGzX).
1.1.4.3.3.5.4. Pro: Determining which accounts are actually affiliated with terror organisations requires special expertise which Facebook and Twitter do not have.
1.1.4.3.3.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.1.4.3.3.5.4.2. Con: A normal human being is capable of seeing the evil of those who advocate for murder and mass genocide. Twitter and Facebook are comprised of human beings.
1.1.4.3.3.5.5. Pro: Facebook and Twitter are companies ultimately responsible primarily to their shareholders and investors. Being responsible to investors allows economic incentives to influence definitional judgement calls.
1.1.4.3.3.6. Con: It is not within the ability of Facebook and Twitter to assess what constitutes a terrorist organisation or content.
1.1.4.3.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.3.
1.1.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.2.2.
1.1.4.3.5. Pro: For years, Facebook has been trying to get unblocked in China in order to access the enormous Chinese market. In the process of this, Facebook executives have been quite willing to [cozy up to the authoritarian Chinese government](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/20/facebooks-mark-zuckerberg-meets-china-propaganda-chief-in-beijing) and allegedly offered to censor content for Chinese users.
1.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.3.1.
1.1.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.3.2.
1.1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.3.3.
1.1.5. Con: Requiring them to delete all accounts affiliated with terrorist organisations places an [undue burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undue_burden_standard) on Facebook and Twitter.
1.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.1.
1.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.1.4.
1.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.4.
1.1.6. Pro: The Patriot Act obliges Facebook and Twitter to delete terror accounts by making it illegal to provide material support to terrorists.
1.1.6.1. Pro: A number of lawsuits \(most recently in [January 2017](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-lawsuits-social-media-terror-20170119-story.html)\) have argued that Facebook and Twitter are "providing material support" to ISIS by letting the organisation use their platforms.
1.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.
1.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.6.1.
1.1.7. Con: Social media accounts shouldn't be removed by virtue of them belonging to supposed terrorist organisations, social media accounts should be removed by virtue of the content they share.
1.1.7.1. Pro: So far, rules on removing terrorist accounts are vague and might lead to the censorship of other content and accounts.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Facebook and Twitter have a track record of censoring content that is legitimate, such as [breastfeeding](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/facebook-breastfeeding-stranger-child-rebecca-wanosik-a7355471.html) or images of the [Vietnam War](http://fortune.com/2016/09/09/facebook-napalm-photo-vietnam-war/).
1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Many prominent personalities suffered from automatically deleted content, such as Norwegian Prime Minister [Erna Solberg](http://uk.businessinsider.com/facebook-censors-norway-prime-minister-erna-solberg-napalm-girl-vietnam-photo-aftenposten-2016-9).
1.1.7.1.1.2. Pro: Facebook has temporarily suspended or blocked activists’ accounts such as a Black Lives Matter [activist](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/12/facebook-blocks-shaun-king-black-lives-matter) or a [pro-Kashmir](http://www.firstpost.com/india/social-media-outrages-over-alleged-blocking-of-pro-kashmir-activists-facebook-account-2887058.html) activist.
1.1.7.1.2. Con: Facebook and Twitter are continuously [improving](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/twitters-policy-reboot-good-bad-and-ugly) their standards. Twitter, for example, added the four categories 'violent threats', 'harassment', 'hateful conduct' and 'self-harm' to describe what previously was just 'abusive behaviour.
1.1.7.1.2.1. Con: Based on [users' experience](https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/20/twitter-claims-its-anti-abuse-measures-are-helping-though-many-still-disagree/) on Twitter, these clarifications have neither led to a more consistent application of Twitter's guidelines nor a more efficient suppression of hate speech.
1.1.7.1.3. Pro: Arbitrary application of rules makes it difficult to hold Facebook or Twitter accountable when they limit freedom of speech.
1.1.7.1.4. Pro: Neither Facebook nor Twitter have clear rules for what is acceptable content and what is not.
1.1.7.1.4.1. Pro: Twitter does not clearly describe what constitutes the '[line into abuse](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/twitters-policy-reboot-good-bad-and-ugly)' in its new behavioral policy and merely describes “threatening or promoting terrorism” as abusive behaviour.
1.1.7.1.4.1.1. Pro: Twitter did not give further clarification for what constitutes “threatening or promoting terrorism" even when [asked](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/twitters-policy-reboot-good-bad-and-ugly) directly.
1.1.7.1.4.2. Pro: Facebook has open-ended [community standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards) and a reporting system that makes the rules and their application vague.
1.1.7.1.4.2.1. Pro: Leaked [documents](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/21/revealed-facebook-internal-rulebook-sex-terrorism-violence) have shown how Facebook policies are unclear, often [arbitrary](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms) and performed by moderators that have about only 10 seconds to decide if they allow an image or they censor it.
1.1.7.1.5. Pro: The blanket application of rules based on strictly defined categories such as "violent imagery is always unacceptable" misses many important nuances of debates about legitimate speech.
1.1.7.1.5.1. Pro: Facebook's violent image policy has lead to the removal of pictures of [crimes committed](https://gigaom.com/2014/02/05/critics-say-facebook-is-erasing-pieces-of-history-by-deleting-pages-about-the-war-in-syria/) by the Syrian government. Many locals have little other options to reach \(and report\) on local cruelties.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Members of ISIS and other similar organizations also post about different things than terrorism. Banning their accounts hurts their freedom of speech.
1.1.7.3. Con: They use those also like a letter box where they private message with others. No reason to provide them with that service.
1.2. Pro: Terrorist organizations are a threat to people all around the world.
1.2.1. Pro: Al-Qaeda and its affiliates operate transnationally. In 2015, they were responsible for 1,620 deaths in a number of countries including Algeria, Bangladesh, France, Kenya, Lebanon, Mali, Pakistan, Uganda and Yemen \([Global Terrorism Index, p. 56](http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2016.2.pdf)\).
1.2.2. Con: If threat to human life is taken as a measure for determining Facebook's and Twitter's policy, the resources of such innovative companies would be much better spent on medical innovation – after all, [diseases and other medical problems](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/) are a much bigger threat to human life than terrorism.
1.2.2.1. Con: The resources that companies like Twitter and Facebook have come from providing value as a popular social media service. If they switched to doing medical research those resources would no longer exist.
1.2.2.2. Con: This is an impossible standard, no person or company has a duty to dedicate themselves solely to the best possible activity for humanity. They only have a duty to not cause harm in what they do choose to do.
1.2.2.3. Con: Unlike medical problems, these companies' products contribute directly to the spread of terrorism and as such they have a moral obligation to fight terrorism's effects before they tackle other global issues.
1.2.3. Pro: ISIS is one the deadliest terror organisations in the world and was responsible for more than 6,000 deaths across the world in 2015 \([Global Terrorism Index, p. 52](http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2016.2.pdf)\).
1.2.3.1. Pro: In addition to blanket attacks against the West, ISIS targets particular groups and minorities for further violence.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: ISIS' [ethical perceptions](http://verilymag.com/2015/10/women-children-girls-isis-yazidis-sunni-slavery-sexual-violence-syria-iraq) allow its members to rape pre-pubescent girls that were kidnapped in order to be kept as "sex slaves", and regard it as condoned by God.
1.2.3.1.2. Pro: ISIS has committed a mass [genocide](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-islamic-state-yazidi-sex-slaves-genocide-sinjar-death-toll-number-kidnapped-study-un-lse-a7726991.html) of northern Iraq's Yazidi people, killing and enslaving thousands of them since 2014.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: [Christians](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/fikraforum/view/from-cairo-to-berlin-why-is-isis-targeting-christians) have been targeted by ISIS both in the Levant and abroad.
1.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: Several indigenous Christian missionaries were [crucified](https://aclj.org/persecuted-church/isis-rapes-crucifies-and-beheads-syrian-christian-missionaries-including-a-12-year-old-boy) by ISIS members in Syria in 2015.
1.2.3.1.3.2. Pro: In 2016, two ISIS members [stormed a church](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36892785) in France and slit the priest's throat.
1.2.3.1.3.3. Pro: In 2017, ISIS killed nearly 50 people in bomb blasts that targeted [Coptic churches](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/09/egypt-coptic-church-bombing-death-toll-rises-tanta-cairo) in Egypt.
1.2.3.1.4. Pro: Gay people have been [systemically persecuted](https://www.counterextremism.com/content/isis-persecution-gay-people) by ISIS since the group's inception, with many victims being thrown off of buildings or stoned to death.
1.2.3.1.5. Pro: Militant Sunni groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda prioritize the [victimization of Shia communities](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/baghdad-bombing-attack-isis-islamic-state-iraq-ramadan-shia-most-victims-muslims-killed-a7120086.html); and it is estimated that Shias comprise the majority of those killed by ISIS.
1.2.3.2. Pro: ISIS has committed atrocities across a multitude of countries.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: The Islamic State carried out synchronized suicide bombings in [Beirut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Beirut_bombings) on November 12th 2015, killing dozens of civilians in a Hezbollah-controlled neighborhood.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: The downing of a [Russian plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrojet_Flight_9268) after its takeoff from the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh in 2015 was one of the worst terrorist attacks on Russian civilians since the fall of the Soviet Union.
1.2.3.2.3. Pro: ISIS commits [war crimes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/john-kerry-isis-genocide-syria-iraq) in Syria and in Iraq.
1.2.3.2.4. Pro: There were ISIS attacks in the centre of [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks).
1.2.3.3. Pro: ISIS' online presence is an integral threat to the West's way of existence to which Facebook and Twitter belong.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: ISIS believes it must [defeat](http://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2015/11/why-isis-seeks-battle-western-nations-and-why-it-can-t-be-ignored) the West.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Facebook and Twitter represent values that are opposed by groups like ISIS.
1.2.3.3.2.1. Con: Terrorist organizations make use of Facebook and Twitter themselves and will not abolish them.
1.2.3.3.2.1.1. Con: This could be a temporary strategy – terror organisations might still abolish Twitter and Facebook once they no longer consider them useful.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: Facebook and Twitter are particularly useful tools for terror organisations due to their global popularity, easy access and ease to reach their audience.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: ISIS itself recognized the unique position of Facebook when they posted "Facebook is a great idea" because one can approach potential targets directly [\(Weimann, p. 4\)](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/new-terrorism-and-new-media).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Social media allows terrorist organizations access to a wider audience \([Weimann, p. 3](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/new-terrorism-and-new-media)\).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Social media allows terrorist organizations to reach groups that they wouldn't otherwise, such as non-religious users \([Alarid, p. 314](http://cco.ndu.edu/Portals/96/Documents/Impunity/Impunity%20FINAL%20for%20Web.pdf)\).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Since Facebook and Twitter allow for cross-posting and re-tweeting content, it provides terrorist organizations with a low cost means of dissemination to a vast global audience [\(Klausen, p. 3\)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1057610X.2014.974948).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: Groups like ISIS use social media to [influence](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-08-25/isis-lone-wolf-strategy) sympathizers to commit terror attacks abroad, since it is easier and more cost effective to encourage lone wolf attacks than trying to sneak established terrorists across international borders.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: Young people are particularly vulnerable to terrorist cyber operations, as they make extensive use of social media.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Youth ranging from 16 to 24 comprise a large if not majority portion of [social media](http://www.statista.com/statistics/274829/age-distribution-of-active-social-media-users-worldwide-by-platform/) users across several influential platforms.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.2.3.2. Pro: [Studies](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/10/16/162997951/teenage-brains-are-malleable-and-vulnerable-researchers-say) have shown that teenage brains are more vulnerable and malleable than those of adults.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3. Pro: Social media can be a useful tool to influence the mindset of a population.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.1.2.2.3.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.2. Pro: Terrorist organizations have used social media as a way of convincing followers to carry out attacks in their name.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.1.2.2.2.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: In 2010, a British woman was arrested and sentenced to life in prison for [attempting to murder](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/world/04britain.html?_r=0) a prominent legislator after she had watched dozens of hours of Anwar al-Awlaki's radical sermons on YouTube and was inspired to take up al-Qaeda's cause.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3. Pro: Social media is a very effective tool for carrying out [psychological warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.1. Con: The spreading of terror news is largely facilitated by major media outlets regardless of terrorist organizations' activities in social networks.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: After the [2017 Westminster attacks](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/london-parliament-attack/london-parliament-attack-media-coverage-triggers-criticism-britain-n738091) in Britain the media was accused of supporting the spread of terrorism by becoming “a megaphone for the act”.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: The media covers claims of responsibility by ISIS, e.g. in the case of [Melbourne](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jun/05/police-shoot-gunman-dead-and-free-hostage-in-melbourne), [Tehran](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/tehran-attacks-isis-suicide-bomb-iran-first-ever-terrorism-claim-responsibility-parliament-shrine-a7776631.html), [London](http://www.politico.eu/article/isis-claims-responsibility-for-london-attack/) or [Manchester](http://time.com/4790201/isis-manchester-concert-terrorist-attack/).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.1.3. Pro: Terror propaganda was spread by news outlets before the advent of social media, such as the 1972 attacks during the [Munich Olympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTqZPKZ4_wk).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.2. Pro: ISIS and other terrorist groups have been known to use Facebook and Twitter for intimidation tactics.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: By encouraging people to link their Twitter accounts to a unique [ISIS app](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/06/isis-iraq-twitter-social-media-strategy/372856/) called 'Dawn', the group is able to use thousands of accounts to spam the same pro-ISIS messages all across the internet and give the illusion of having more support than they actually do.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.2.2. Pro: ISIS also frequently posts links to graphic [videos](http://www.popsci.com/terror-on-twitter-how-isis-is-taking-war-to-social-media) showing executions of people deemed 'kafir' \(i.e. enemies of Islam\).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.2.3. Pro: They have also been known to engage in [hashtag hijacking](http://www.popsci.com/terror-on-twitter-how-isis-is-taking-war-to-social-media), wherein they will use an army of Twitter bots to hijack unrelated hashtags so as to expand their audiences.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.2.3.1. Pro: For [example](http://www.popsci.com/terror-on-twitter-how-isis-is-taking-war-to-social-media), following the 2014 World Cup ISIS members tweeted an image of a decapitated head with the caption “This is our football, it’s made of skin #WorldCup.”
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.2.4. Pro: When ISIS captured the city of Mosul in June 2014, they simultaneously launched a [social media campaign](http://www.popsci.com/terror-on-twitter-how-isis-is-taking-war-to-social-media) with the hashtag #AllEyesonISIS that sowed fear and defeatism amongst the city's residents. It is believed that this was a major reason why ISIS was victorious, despite being outnumbered 15-1 by Iraqi forces.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.3. Pro: Terrorist organizations often use social media to garner sympathy for a cause.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: In 2014, ISIS accounts began [tweeting](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/isis-propaganda-on-twitter-turns-to-kittens-and-lolspeak-i-can-haz-islamic-state-plz-9683736.html) pictures of members playing with kittens as a way to humanize themselves.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.3.2. Pro: ISIS members as well as sympathizers will often post video and images on social media of [coalition-led drone strikes](http://www.jihadica.com/death-from-above-jihadist-virtual-networks-respond-to-drone-strikes-in-yemen/), which inevitably showcase civilian victims and vilify the West.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.3.3. Pro: ISIS released a video series titled ["Mujatweets"](https://news.vice.com/article/isis-has-a-really-slick-and-sophisticated-media-department) that emphasized the camaraderie of their fighters by showing them visiting hospitalized comrades and handing out candy to children.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.4. Pro: Terrorist groups have also employed [PsyOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Operations_\(United_States\)) in their recruitment strategy by painting false pictures of what life is like as an extremist.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.4.1. Pro: ISIS lured many young recruits to the Levant by utilizing a [social media campaign](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/isis-video-game) that compared life as a jihadist to the popular video games series "Call of Duty".
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.4.2. Pro: For instance, ISIS uses social media to directly interact with young Muslim women in Western countries, [promise them marriage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/french-journalist-poses-muslim-convert-isis-anna-erelle), build on a will for [teenage rebellion](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/appeal-isis-muslim-outsider-recruits), or use their disillusionment with their home country to motivate them to join ISIS. This individually tailored and highly personalised recruitment would not be possible at a distance without social media.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.5. Pro: The Iraqi government considered ISIS' psychological warfare to be very dangerous and therefore [blocked](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27869112) Facebook and Twitter.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.4. Con: Thought control should not be a tool in anyone's repertoire.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4. Pro: Terrorist organizations use Twitter and Facebook for [recruiting](http://ijr.com/2015/08/380544-how-isis-made-twitter-one-of-its-main-recruiting-tools-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/) purposes \(i.e. convince people to either physically join them or carry out attacks in their name\).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.1. Con: Major recruitment channels of terrorists are outside of Facebook and Twitter. Restrictions on these sites will not have a major impact.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Minors are sometimes indoctrinated before being exposed to Facebook or Twitter through [text books](http://www.ibtimes.com/isis-iraq-islamic-states-recruits-orphan-children-kill-teaches-kids-about-guns-swords-2493719) that praise radical Islam and militarism.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Fleeing refugees get [recruited](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/05/isis-recruitment-drive-child-refugees) in refugee camps as well, thus social media does not seem to play a major role in the recruiting process of refugees.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.1.3. Con: Social media recruiting is a cheap way with little costs or danger of detection that allows access to a wide audience \([Alarid, p. 314](http://cco.ndu.edu/Portals/96/Documents/Impunity/Impunity%20FINAL%20for%20Web.pdf)\). This is difficult to compensate.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.1.2.2.2.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.1.4. Pro: Although Twitter and Facebook are used to spread awareness of groups like ISIS and to encourage new members to join, the actual recruitment process is initiated through a series of [encrypted messaging apps](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/isis-messaging-apps).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.1.4.1. Con: Deleting their accounts on Facebook and Twitter would make it harder for terror organisations to reach these people in the first place.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.1.5. Con: Social media allow terror organisations to reach the widest possible audience and spread their ideas to people who are not yet sufficiently radicalised to be active on other, less mainstream channels.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.1.5.1. Pro: According to a report by the US Department of Homeland Security, Facebook provides an [important gateway](http://cco.ndu.edu/News/Article/780274/chapter-13-recruitment-and-radicalization-the-role-of-social-media-and-new-tech/) for introducing users to extremist content and discussion forums.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.1.6. Con: Given the disastrous effect of terror attacks, cracking down on terrorist groups on Facebook and Twitter is worth it as long as some recruitment happens on or is enabled through activity on these platforms.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.2. Pro: Around [30,000](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/isis-winning-social-media-war-heres-beat/) individuals have been recruited through social media.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.2.1. Con: The cited article refers to recruitment based on the influence of digital propaganda in general, and is therefore not an accurate reflection of recruitment done over Facebook and Twitter specifically.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.3. Pro: Social media allows terrorist organizations to tailor their content to specific niche groups.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.4.2.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.4. Con: Erasing terrorists' social media presence does nothing to fight the underlying reasons why first and second generation immigrants in the West feel isolated and are easily recruited by terror organisations.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.4.1. Con: Combatting the root causes of radicalisation and erasing terrorist organisations on social media are not mutually exclusive strategies. Instead, the two need to be combined to effectively combat terrorism.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.2.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.6. Pro: By regularly posting violent imagery, terror organisations can [desensitise](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/laugh-cry-live/201312/protect-your-brain-images-violence-and-cruelty) their followers to violence and lower their inhibitions when it comes to using violence themselves. This can normalise violence and make it easier to recruit new terrorists.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.5. Pro: Their strong audiovisual focus makes Facebook and Twitter especially effective for spreading terrorist propaganda.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.5.1. Pro: ISIS uses social media channels to lure teenage women interested in providing humanitarian aid in Syria and turn them into [sex slaves](http://www.teenvogue.com/story/isis-recruits-american-teens).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.1.2.3.3.3.
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.5.3. Pro: Open publications, such as the magazine '[Inspire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspire_\(magazine\))' or '[Dabiq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabiq_\(magazine\))', are easier to distribute through social media channels \([Alarid, p. 316](http://cco.ndu.edu/Portals/96/Documents/Impunity/Impunity%20FINAL%20for%20Web.pdf)\).
1.2.3.3.2.1.2.6. Pro: Facebook and Twitter are a useful tool to claim responsibility for attacks around the world.
1.2.3.3.2.2. Pro: Two of Facebook's [values](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ceo-zuckerberg-facebooks-5-core-values/) as outlined by Mark Zuckerberg contradict those of ISIS: be open, and build social value for the world.
1.2.3.3.2.2.1. Con: At the same time, [three of Facebook's core values](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ceo-zuckerberg-facebooks-5-core-values/) are growth oriented and in line with ISIS' utilization of Facebook: focus on impact, move fast, and be bold.
1.2.3.3.2.3. Pro: As Facebook is a platform for everybody, it can be seen as a worldwide community that accepts everyone without discrimination based on religion, origin, ethnicity or sex.
1.2.3.3.2.3.1. Con: Facebook made it possible for advertisers to [target](http://mashable.com/2016/11/12/facebook-google-ad-discrimination/#N6XNVi_3KkqZ) or exclude users based on "ethnic affinity" or race.
1.2.3.3.2.3.2. Con: Facebook often bans or suspends user accounts of [Black](https://medium.com/\@thedididelgado/mark-zuckerberg-hates-black-people-ae65426e3d2a), [trans](https://www.change.org/p/facebook-stop-censoring-and-banning-the-accounts-of-black-and-trans-activists), and other activists for posting about experiences around discrimination and online abuse.
1.2.3.3.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.1.1.2.
1.2.3.3.2.4. Pro: Facebook and Twitter are capitalist entities. Terrorism is a threat to [capitalism](http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/cancer-modern-capitalism-1323585268).
1.2.3.3.2.4.1. Con: Terror organisations are themselves integrated into global capitalism and depend on it for [financing their activities](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/18/how-isis-makes-its-money/).
1.2.3.3.3. Con: ISIS does not threaten the existence of the West but fights whoever is in its way to power.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: ISIS fought first against [dictatorial regimes](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/1.686403) in Syria and Iraq; and not against the West.
1.2.3.3.3.2. Pro: ISIS targeted France because of its participation in the ["Crusader campaign"](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/1.686403) and not because it is a Western country.
1.2.3.3.3.3. Con: However the West is the embodiment of everything that ISIS stands against, therefore its existence is indeed threatened.
1.2.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: In the most recent issue of Dabiq, ISIS' online magazine, they published an article titled "Why We Hate You & Why We Fight You" that explicitly states the reasoning behind the group's enmity towards Westerners [\(Dabiq, p. 30\)](https://azelin.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/the-islamic-state-e2809cdacc84biq-magazine-1522.pdf).
1.2.3.3.3.4. Con: ISIS leaders have encouraged their followers to attack "infidels" wherever they can if they cannot make it to the Syria/Iraq to live in their caliphate.
1.2.3.3.3.5. Con: ISIS believes that as time goes on and their caliphate becomes more powerful, they will expand their caliphate to encompass the whole earth \(including the West\). This is part of their apocalyptic theology.
1.2.3.3.4. Pro: Many employees at Facebook and Twitter are citizens of the [West](https://www.recode.net/2015/6/25/11563890/facebook-employee-demographics-a-little-less-white-a-little-less-male). Therefore, they must join the fight against all terrorist groups, including ISIS.
1.2.3.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.3.
1.2.3.3.6. Con: The countries most affected by terrorism are Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Syria, none of which are usually considered as belonging to the West \([Global Terrorism Index, p. 15](http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2016.2.pdf)\).
1.2.3.3.6.1. Con: Just because terrorism presents a bigger problem for some non-Western countries does not negate the fact that it is still a threat to Western countries.
1.2.4. Con: Deleting accounts linked to terror organisations is unlikely to change this. In fact, it might undermine the fight against terrorism.
1.2.4.1. Con: Facebook and Twitter have the ability to weaken operations of organizations like ISIS by erasing their presence on these sites.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: There would be less opportunity for ISIS to track down societal groups that it actively persecutes, such as [homosexuals](http://globalnews.ca/news/2184492/isis-targets-gay-people-using-facebook-and-phone-contacts-iraqi-refugee-tells-un/), [Shi'ias](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/05/isis-iraq-shia-muslims-jihadis-atrocities), [Christians](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iraq-christians-persecuted-by-isis-60-minutes/), and [Jews](https://www.adl.org/blog/new-isis-and-al-qaeda-propaganda-prioritize-the-us-and-jews-as-targets).
1.2.4.1.3. Pro: Groups like ISIS and al Qaeda use Twitter as a way to [announce](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rumiyah?lang=en) the release of their online publications, which include operational and tactical information such as bomb recipes and weapons maintenance.
1.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: Following the 2016 Bastille Day lorry attack in Nice, ISIS released an issue of their publication "Rumiyah" that [gave instructions](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/berlin-attack-isis-magazine-tips-nice-style-lorry-truck-terror-rumiyah-anis-amir-a7488996.html) on how to carry out an assault with a vehicle so as to maximize casualties.
1.2.4.1.4. Pro: Terrorist groups such as ISIS use Facebook and Twitter to raise money. Removing their presence from these sites would hamper this possibility.
1.2.4.1.4.1. Con: Donations or remittances only make up a marginal percentage of ISIS' income. This loss would therefore be inconsequential.
1.2.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: Most of ISIS' economy is [supplied](http://www.globalresearch.ca/logistics-101-where-does-isis-get-its-guns/5454726) through domestic and international supply lines. Otherwise it would be impossible to keep up the fight at such a scale.
1.2.4.1.4.2. Pro: Saudi authorities [reported](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/homeland-security/260597-how-do-isis-terrorists-finance-their-attacks) that individuals associated with ISIS solicited donors via Twitter and told them to establish contact over Skype.
1.2.4.1.4.3. Pro: As of 2017, Facebook [integrated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-21/facebook-messenger-now-lets-you-send-money-with-transferwise) their Messenger app with an international money transfer service that will let people set up foreign exchange transactions.
1.2.4.1.4.4. Con: Terrorists have been increasingly [switching](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/06/07/net-extremists-drop-twitter-telegram) their communications to encrypted messaging apps rather than using Facebook or Twitter.
1.2.4.1.4.4.1. Pro: As of [June 2017](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/06/07/net-extremists-drop-twitter-telegram), ISIS' use of Twitter and Facebook have significantly decreased, particularly in recruitment efforts. Thus the removal of associated accounts from these sites will likely have little effect on counter-terrorist operations.
1.2.4.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.1.6.
1.2.4.1.6. Con: Terrorist cyber activities are not limited to Facebook and Twitter. Thus, their activities will not suffer beyond repair.
1.2.4.1.6.1. Con: Every little step is important to fight terrorism.
1.2.4.1.6.2. Pro: Youtube videos are an effective tool to create sympathy for ISIS \([Alarid, p. 318](http://cco.ndu.edu/Portals/96/Documents/Impunity/Impunity%20FINAL%20for%20Web.pdf)\).
1.2.4.1.6.3. Pro: ISIS uses video games, such as '[Quest for Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_Bush)', to solicit sympathizers \([Alarid, p. 319](http://cco.ndu.edu/Portals/96/Documents/Impunity/Impunity%20FINAL%20for%20Web.pdf)\).
1.2.4.1.6.4. Pro: ISIS uses '[dead drop](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/24048/what-are-the-supposed-security-benefits-of-a-dead-drop-email-strategy)' emails \(emails saved as draft rather then send\)  that are more difficult to detect \([Alarid, p. 320](http://cco.ndu.edu/Portals/96/Documents/Impunity/Impunity%20FINAL%20for%20Web.pdf)\).
1.2.4.1.6.5. Pro: ISIS posts training material on a variety of websites and uses internet search for intelligence purposes \([Alarid, p. 320](http://cco.ndu.edu/Portals/96/Documents/Impunity/Impunity%20FINAL%20for%20Web.pdf)\)
1.2.4.1.6.6. Pro: ISIS makes use of cyber attacks, such as in the case of the [National Health Service](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/isis-islamist-hackers-nhs-websites-cyber-attack-syrian-civil-war-images-islamic-state-a7567236.html).
1.2.4.1.6.7. Pro: [Al Hayat](https://news.vice.com/article/isis-has-a-really-slick-and-sophisticated-media-department) Media Center produces various propaganda videos.
1.2.4.1.6.8. Pro: Even if Facebook and Twitter remove all associated accounts, groups like ISIS will find other social media sites to develop their online presence.
1.2.4.1.6.8.1. Pro: ISIS as an entity does not release material on Facebook or Twitter; they release it on their news apparatus [Amaq News Agency](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/world/middleeast/a-news-agency-with-scoops-directly-from-isis-and-a-veneer-of-objectivity.html), which ISIS sympathizers or individual members then share via social media. Deleting ISIS accounts therefore might slow the spread of their propaganda, but it will do nothing to remove it from the internet.
1.2.4.1.6.9. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.1.2.
1.2.4.1.7. Con: Terrorist activity on Facebook and Twitter is useful to the development of counter-terrorism operations.
1.2.4.1.7.1. Pro: Surveillance of terrorist organizations' Facebook and Twitter activities provides intelligence agencies with valuable access to their [digital footprints](https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-05-13/how-isis-recruits-online-using-encryption-chat-rooms-and-even-dating-sites), which provides information about the group's tactics, members, and sympathizers.
1.2.4.1.7.1.1. Pro: "Social monitoring" is a way of finding terrorist sympathizers and therefore protecting society.
1.2.4.1.7.1.1.1. Con: This could still be accomplished on the other sites that terrorist groups utilize, such as their public webpages or other social media.
1.2.4.1.7.1.1.2. Pro: The FBI found and arrested ISIS sympathisers by social [monitoring](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/01/isis-america-twitter-social-media-radicalisation).
1.2.4.1.7.1.2. Pro: Pro-ISIS posts by American and British citizens have actually been the [catalyst](http://www.thedailybeast.com/jailed-for-twitter-terrorism-supporting-isis-and-al-qaeda) for various criminal convictions. Had these people not been allowed to post on Twitter, they may never have been caught by law enforcement before it was too late.
1.2.4.1.7.1.3. Pro: Sometimes posts on terrorist social media accounts provide clues to upcoming attacks, which can give law enforcement an advantage in attack prevention.
1.2.4.1.7.1.3.1. Pro: In July 2015, open-source intelligence that was gathered from social media and passed to the FBI led to the [prevention](http://www.popsci.com/terror-on-twitter-how-isis-is-taking-war-to-social-media) of a terror attack in Tunisia as well as the arrest of nearly a dozen militants.
1.2.4.1.7.1.4. Con: Groups like ISIS could very easily use social media to post red herrings about their operations or intended targets. If intelligence agencies chase down these false leads then it will be a massive waste of valuable time and manpower.
1.2.4.1.7.1.5. Pro: As long as terrorist organisations use Facebook or Twitter, Western intelligence services have a chance of tracking their activity and gathering intelligence. If their accounts start to be deleted aggressively, they might move to other less accessible platforms.
1.2.4.1.7.1.5.1. Con: Groups like ISIS have already begun to move most of their online interactions to [encrypted apps](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kb7n4a/isis-messaging-apps), so it will make little difference going forward should Facebook and Twitter become more or less aggressive in their account monitoring.
1.2.4.1.7.1.5.2. Pro: When Facebook started cracking down on extreme right-wing groups, neo-nazi groups such as the US-based  "United Aryan Front" started to use the [Russian network VKontakte](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/extremist-groups-vkontakte/483426/) instead.
1.2.4.1.7.1.6. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.4.1.
1.2.4.1.7.2. Pro: Governments, companies, and activists alike have utilized Facebook and Twitter to disseminate anti-ISIS propaganda in an effort to discredit the group and decrease their appeal.
1.2.4.1.7.2.1. Pro: Online support for anti-ISIS fighters, such as [#AbuAzrael](https://twitter.com/hashtag/abuazrael?lang=en), a hashtag in support of an [anti-ISIS militia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Azrael) commander, strengthens movements that fight ISIS' online presence.
1.2.4.1.7.2.2. Pro: Humor, as employed by [Japanese activists](http://www.complex.com/style/2015/01/japan-mocking-isis-with-twitter-photoshops), can work to ridicule ISIS.
1.2.4.1.7.2.3. Pro: Facebook itself [created a team](https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-terrorist-propaganda-still-a-challenge-for-tech-companies-1496712112) dedicated to removing terrorist content and has been promoting anti-militant posts so as to make the site a “hostile environment for terrorists.”
1.2.4.1.7.2.4. Pro: State agencies, such as the [Global Engagement Center](https://www.state.gov/r/gec/), can use terrorist groups on Facebook and Twitter to disseminate counterterrorism information.
1.2.4.1.7.2.4.1. Con: Disseminating counterterrorism information allows terrorist organizations a [stage](http://time.com/3387065/isis-twitter-war-state-department/) upon which to post their propaganda.
1.2.4.1.7.2.4.2. Pro: The hashtag [#thinkagain_dos](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThinkAgain_DOS?src=hash) was created and promoted by the US government to counter ISIS online activities.
1.2.4.1.7.2.5. Pro: The U.S. Department of State has [published](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/11/19/fight-against-isis-reveals-power-of-social-media/) hundreds of videos shared on Youtube, Twitter, and Facebook that counter the message of extremist groups such as ISIS.
1.2.4.1.7.2.6. Pro: A [military raid](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/11/19/fight-against-isis-reveals-power-of-social-media/) to free Kurdish prisoners from ISIS-controlled territory was filmed via a soldier's helmet camera and then released on Twitter where it immediately went viral. It proved to be an exceptionally useful piece of counter-propaganda as it showed Arab and American forces working together to fight terrorism.
1.2.4.1.7.2.7. Con: This can still be done while removing the accounts of terrorist organisations - and would likely be more effective that way.
1.2.4.1.7.2.7.1. Con: Users interested in terrorist content, who are the main target of these deradicalisation campaigns, are likely to move to other platforms if most of the accounts they follow are removed.
1.2.4.1.7.2.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.7.1.5.2.
1.2.4.1.7.3. Pro: Interested users can sow doubt in threads that treat terror organizations in a positive light.
1.2.4.1.7.4. Con: As of today, internet counterterrorism is judged to be ineffective \([Weimann, p. 14](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/new-terrorism-and-new-media)\).
1.2.4.1.7.5. Con: Empirical studies are inadequate to give a good picture of terrorists' internet activities \([Weimann, p. 14](http://file:///C:/Users/Gregor/Downloads/STIP_140501_new_terrorism_F.pdf)\). This lack of scientific research makes it difficult to use Facebook and Twitter as tool to fight ISIS or other terrorist organizations online.
1.2.4.1.7.6. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.4.
1.2.4.1.7.7. Pro: If users look for or spread terror propaganda on Facebook or Twitter, they can easily be identified and [specifically targeted](http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/youtube-redirect-terrorism-searches-anti-hate-videos-1202501297/) with deradicalisation campaigns.
1.2.4.1.7.8. Con: No matter whether the user is a terrorist, counter-terrorism operations would be violating the privacy of the user unless they only supervise public threads.
1.2.4.1.7.8.1. Pro: When a social network thread is private, any act of supervision would be unlawful, even from counter-terrorism operations.
1.2.4.1.7.8.2. Pro: Any user is innocent until proven guilty hence counter-terrorism operations can't monitor any private thread unless the officers are invited.
1.2.4.1.8. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.4.4.1.
1.2.4.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.1.2.
1.2.4.1.10. Con: Terrorist organizations will use suppression by social media websites to validate their claims that their viewpoint is marginalized.
1.2.4.1.10.1. Con: Terrorist organizations approach their issues through violence and therefore any claims that they are marginalized become invalid.
1.2.4.1.10.2. Con: Terrorist will be unsuccessful in validating their claims because they are not justified as they use social media platforms in order to spread violence and chaos beyond their location.
1.2.4.1.10.2.1. Pro: Those who aren't already convinced by the terrorists are likely to consider the deletion of Facebook and Twitter accounts legitimate.
1.2.4.1.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.
1.2.4.1.10.4. Pro: Suppressing their online presence provides terrorist organizations with the ammunition needed to claim victim status on the grounds of censorship and oppression. Regardless of whether this is justified, framing their narrative this way \(i.e. as an underdog standing up to a bigger, stronger enemy\) is a powerful rallying cry that will boost their support base.
1.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.7.
1.2.4.3. Pro: If citizens or the government believe that removing accounts of terror organizations on Facebook and Twitter are a major step in counterterrorism, they may view the threat as suppressed, even though terror organizations are still just as big of a deal without social media accounts.
1.2.5. Pro: [Boko Haram](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/09/boko-haram-deadliest-massacre-baga-nigeria), a militant Islamist group designated by many countries as a terrorist organization, has killed thousands of people in Nigeria.
1.2.6. Pro: [Over 220,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/08/24/the-staggering-toll-of-colombias-war-with-farc-rebels-explained-in-numbers/?utm_term=.fdd8420ef30a) people have been killed as a result of the civil war between the Columbian government and FARC, an insurgent group that is considered a [terrorist organization](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11400950) by the US and Europe.
1.2.7. Pro: [The Tamil Tigers](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists), a terrorist organization based in Sri Lanka and the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, carried out over 200 suicide bombings against both political and civilian targets during their decades-long conflict with the government.
1.2.8. Con: Those called terrorists may be called freedom fighters by others.
1.2.9. Con: The conditions that create terrorism is the real threat. Terrorism is a symptom of people having been denied basic freedoms and means to survive.[See the debate on Quora.com](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-real-reasons-behind-terrorism)
1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.7.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.5. Con: Removing accounts of terror organizations sets a dangerous precedent for other countries to fight their 'terrorists'.
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.
1.5.2. Con: A precedent does not in and of itself compel social media platforms to combat so-called "terror organisations" brought to their attention by authoritarian and undemocratic states. They can always decide not to censor these groups.
1.5.2.1. Con: If Facebook and Twitter decide to censor groups persecuted by the US, but not those by other states like China or Turkey, they would lose any remaining credibility in claiming a role as neutral intermediaries without a political agenda.
1.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.
1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.4.
1.5.5. Con: Other countries are already fighting their "terrorists", the precedent that the west is currently promoting is pacifism.
1.6. Con: Limiting terrorists' activities online limits basic rights on the internet.
1.6.1. Pro: People have a right to be informed about what is happening in the world; and since social media is a major news source for many people, they will lose that opportunity if videos and posts from terrorist groups are blocked.
1.6.1.1. Pro: According to a [UK-based poll](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/yemen-civil-war-british-weapons-poll-human-appeal-half-unaware-saudi-air-strikes-civilian-deaths-a7636271.html), over 50% of respondents were unaware of the ongoing civil war in Yemen. Blocking information posted by terrorist organizations could lead to a similar [lack of awareness](https://gigaom.com/2015/02/06/heres-why-platforms-like-youtube-shouldnt-remove-isis-videos/) amongst the public.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: You don't have to be a terrorist to post about an atrocity you've witnessed.
1.6.1.2. Pro: In the past, Western media has been known to show graphic images and videos when reporting on violent events, such as photos of [concentration camps](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2011/10/world-war-ii-the-holocaust/100170/) or the [Vietnam War](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/06/the-historic-napalm-girl-pulitzer-image-marks-its-40th-anniversary/). The graphic nature of terrorist activities should similarly remain uncensored.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: In these examples, cruel imagery was accompanied by context and explanation provided by Western media. This is not comparable to violent content published by terror organisations.
1.6.1.3. Pro: Violence and destruction is everywhere in the media already. Terrorists' place in the media is nothing special anymore.
1.6.1.3.1. Con: Most media violence does not involve the intentional real-world slaughter of innocent civilians. In that regard, terrorism is an incomparable act and should be treated as such.
1.6.1.3.2. Pro: There are [violent videos](http://www.kmov.com/story/29471793/does-social-media-encourage-young-people-to-commit-violent-acts) unrelated to terror on Facebook already.
1.6.1.3.3. Pro: Since the 1950s society has become more accustomed to violence on TV \([Ta, p. 80](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3cn0c88x)\)
1.6.1.4. Con: Terrorist propaganda is cruel and unpleasant to watch.
1.6.1.4.1. Con: Many sites on the internet display graphic content that is cruel and unpleasant to watch.
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: Especially in the current era of political correctness and trigger warnings, some people might find such material to be highly offensive and would prefer not to risk any exposure to it.
1.6.1.5. Pro: People are entitled to form their own opinions about the world; however, if they are unable to access news and media from both sides of a conflict, then they are denied the chance to gather all of the necessary facts before doing so.
1.6.1.5.1. Pro: The role of social media should be to help people refine sensemaking, not to be thought police. Only by enabling people to develop their capacities can society become more coherent.
1.6.1.6. Pro: Although they are highly disturbing, watching the violent videos that terrorist groups release is the only way to fully understand and appreciate the barbarity of their actions. As such, it is a necessary evil for them to be accessible to the public.
1.6.1.6.1. Pro: Seeing videos and/or images of violent acts is more likely to motivate people to take action than simply reading about them would.
1.6.1.6.1.1. Pro: Disseminating graphic images has helped shape public opinion and policy in the past, such as how photos of the [Vietnam war](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/07/the-gutless-press/309405/) fueled anti-war protests and the [Abu Ghraib](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/magazine/regarding-the-torture-of-others.html?mcubz=2) torture photos brought the issue of prisoner treatment to the forefront of public debate.
1.6.1.6.1.2. Con: Consuming violent imagery could just as easily backfire.
1.6.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Although violence is a deterrent for most people, extended research has found that seeing violent imagery can make some people feel drawn to [take part in it in real life](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704015/) \(depending on some moderating factors such as type of images and plot, personal characteristics and social context\).
1.6.1.6.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.6.
1.6.1.6.2. Pro: Horrific pictures and videos actually aid in the fight against groups like ISIS by creating international resistance to their brutality.
1.6.1.6.2.1. Con: It is ISIS' [aim](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/?utm_source=SFFB) to pull more foreign powers into the war to display themselves as defendants against the rest of the world. A dialectic struggle between the 'right' jihad and the 'evil' rest in which they are the only alternative.
1.6.1.6.2.2. Pro: [Jordan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/jordan-air-strikes-isis-pilot-murder) intensified its airstrikes after the brutal murder of one of its pilots.
1.6.1.7. Con: Major terrorist-related news will be reported on by secondary sources. There is no need for that news to originate on social media itself.
1.6.1.8. Con: Terrorist groups can post their news and videos on platforms other than social media. If people desire to access that 'news' they can seek it there.
1.6.1.9. Con: If people simply watch this material without context or, at worst, contextualised by terrorist propaganda, it is highly unlikely to be a reliable source of information. Instead, it is likely to serve terrorists' own purposes.
1.6.1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.2.1.2.4.6.
1.6.1.10. Pro: The presence of such accounts gives users of the Internet a more accurate impression of the world.
1.6.2. Pro: Fighting terrorists' Facebook and Twitter activities limits freedom of speech enshrined in [Article 19](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
1.6.2.1. Con: Only the freedom of speech of the most extreme parts of society will be limited. This is done already, e.g. by prohibiting [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech#Hate_speech_laws).
1.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.2.1.
1.6.2.3. Pro: Freedom of speech is one of the core values that Western countries claim to defend against terror organisations. Limiting it makes the West look hypocritical, undermines its credibility and damages its capability to fight terrorism.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: If Western actors contradict their own values, they provide terror organisations with ammunition for their propaganda. For example, human rights abuses at Guantanamo have featured in propaganda from a [variety of terror organisations](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/04/how-guantanamo-bays-existence-helps-al-qaeda-recruit-more-terrorists/274956/).
1.6.2.3.2. Pro: Non-Western countries are less likely to support Western countries when they are perceived to act out of self-interest. For example, the perception that the US acted out of self-interest during the [Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War) made other countries reluctant to support a humanitarian intervention in Darfur in 2004 \([Bellamy, p. 31](http://www.colonelby.com/teachers/krichardson/Grade%2012/Carleton%20-%20Int%20Law%20Course/Week%207/R2P%20or%20Trojan.pdf)\).
1.6.2.4. Pro: Overly aggressive action will result in some users being targeted without being members of terror organisations.
1.6.2.4.1. Pro: Users might be merely friendly to the cause and share the message of terror organisations. ISIS, for example, called on the Facebook community to share their comments [\(Weimann, p. 3\)](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/new-terrorism-and-new-media).
1.6.2.4.1.1. Con: People who are "friendly" or sympathetic to a terrorist cause are ripe targets for further radicalization and should be treated accordingly.
1.6.2.4.2. Pro: Accounts that are not affiliated with terrorist organisations are in danger of being taken down as an unintended side effect.
1.6.2.4.2.1. Pro: Accounts that post about terror [news](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40290258) often might be identified as terrorist accounts by artificial intelligence, e.g. because they feature ISIS-created video or text.
1.6.2.4.2.2. Pro: The account of [Iyad Al-Baghdadi](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/twitters-policy-reboot-good-bad-and-ugly), a human rights activist, was misidentified as ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi
1.6.2.5. Pro: Creating any exceptions for freedom of speech on Facebook and Twitter limits their ability to provide a free platform for users around the world since these exceptions can easily be abused by governments.
1.6.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.
1.6.2.5.2. Pro: Crackdowns on NGOs in dictatorships can cause spillover effects for [NGOs in democracies](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/02/the-syrian-opposition-is-disappearing-from-facebook/283562/). For example, the British NGO 'Syrian Network for Human Rights' has been removed for its anti-government content after efforts made by Syria.
1.6.2.5.3. Con: Only 2% of blocked accounts on Twitter are taken down because of government action. The vast majority has been suspended due to "[internal, proprietary spam-fighting tools](https://transparency.twitter.com/en/gov-tos-reports.html)".
1.6.2.5.4. Pro: Google representatives cautioned that complying to one demand opens a "[Pandora's box](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/inside-the-obama-administrations-attempt-to-bring-tech-compa?utm_term=.ncjWoaNe8#.ns6yYOaE3)" and will allow other governments to ask for the same.
1.6.2.5.4.1. Con: Since it is in the self-interest of tech companies to avoid the high costs associated with removing all terrorist content, they are likely to over-exaggerate the negative consequences of doing so.
1.6.2.5.5. Pro: Social media platforms are already complying with the demands of governments to censor certain groups for political reasons.
1.6.2.5.5.1. Pro: Facebook blocked the accounts of pro-Western Ukrainians following a campaign by [Russian](https://www.justsecurity.org/28755/social-media-companies-decline-governments-invitation-join-national-security-state/)-speaking users.
1.6.2.5.5.2. Pro: Facebook already complies with demands of the [Syrian government](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/02/the-syrian-opposition-is-disappearing-from-facebook/283562/) to shut down pages of the opposition.
1.6.2.5.5.2.1. Con: Many pages that oppose the Syrian government are [ISIS or al-Qaeda](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/02/the-syrian-opposition-is-disappearing-from-facebook/283562/) affiliated.
1.6.2.5.6. Pro: States are already putting pressure on social media platforms to block and delete accounts according to their political agenda.
1.6.2.5.6.1. Pro: There were [88 cases](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/21/twitter-nixed-635k-terrorism-accounts-between-mid-2015-and-end-of-2016/) of governments demanding the removal of accredited journalists or news outlets between mid-2015 and late 2016.
1.6.2.5.6.2. Pro: The [US](http://myfox8.com/2017/03/23/twitters-purging-terror-accounts-at-a-dizzying-rate-tmwsp/) puts pressure on Facebook and Twitter to target content that is a threat to 'national security'.
1.6.2.5.6.3. Pro: [Germany](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/18/twitter-block-neo-nazi-account) demanded that Twitter blocks neo-Nazi accounts.
1.6.2.5.6.4. Pro: The [Turkish](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-23079607) government already puts more pressure on Facebook and Twitter to provide information about 'their' dissidents.
1.6.2.5.7. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.
1.6.2.6. Con: Freedom of speech rights and laws are intended to prevent governments from actively censoring their citizens. They do not require that private forums or companies refrain from self-moderating.
1.6.2.7. Con: People do not have the right to advocate for genocide.
1.6.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.6.2.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.
1.6.3. Pro: Prohibiting activities of a certain group reduces the openness of the internet.
1.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.
1.6.3.2. Con: Limiting openness is an acceptable price for keeping everyone safe.
1.6.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.6.3.2.2. Pro: Safety is necessary for true openness: If people have to be worried about encountering violent imagery as part of terrorist propaganda, or of being stalked by accounts linked to terror organisations, the Internet is not truly open.
1.6.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.4.
1.6.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.
1.6.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.2.
1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.6.5. Con: It is acceptable to limit these rights if necessary for saving lives.
1.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.6.6. Con: We do not for example allow child pornographers to use Facebook, therefore there is precedent for clearly unacceptable material to be denied its use.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.
1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.6.
1.9. Con: Facebook and Twitter should not take political positions.
1.9.1. Con: Facebook and Twitter are already political.
1.9.1.1. Pro: [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Facebook#China) prohibits Facebook because the company doesn't comply with its content filtering policy.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.5.
1.9.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.2.1.
1.9.1.3. Pro: [Facebook diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_diplomacy) and [Twiplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_diplomacy) are standards in public diplomacy. Facebook and Twitter are already deeply involved.
1.9.1.4. Con: Providing a platform for the distribution of all kinds of information, including political, is not the same as being political.
1.9.1.5. Pro: Facebook Vice President of Global Communications regards his company "[absolutely](https://www.cfr.org/interview/new-media-tools-and-public-diplomacy)" as part of public diplomacy.
1.9.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.3.1.
1.9.2. Pro: Taking political positions can endanger the lives of their employees.
1.9.2.1. Pro: In 2015, ISIS issued [death threats](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/isis-terror/twitter-reviewing-alleged-isis-threat-co-founder-jack-dorsey-n315346) against Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey for removing ISIS-related accounts.
1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.5.
1.9.4. Con: Removing accounts that promote violent material is not a political stance, but rather a matter of common sense and general user safety.
1.9.4.1. Con: If this were true, then that would mean all social media accounts could be removed because of any violent material posted, even if it isn't related to terrorism.
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.4.1.6.
1.9.6. Pro: Taking political positions is against their business model.
1.9.6.1. Con: Facebook and Twitter are private companies. If being biased helps them to generate and gain profit, they can and should do it.
1.9.6.2. Con: If Facebook and Twitter do not cooperate with governments, they are likely to face regulatory measures. Anticipating this, Facebook cracked down on 30,000 fake accounts in [Franc](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/13/facebook-cracks-down-on-30000-fake-accounts-in-france.html)e before the election.
1.9.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.9.6.4. Con: Facebook allows access to their website via their [Onion service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebookcorewwwi.onion) that was established to circumvent state internet censorship.
1.9.6.5. Pro: Facebook and - especially - Twitter are about "raw" and unfiltered information, often in the form of images and videos. Doing this would damage that purpose.
