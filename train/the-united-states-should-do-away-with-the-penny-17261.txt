Discussion Title: The United States should do away with the penny.

1. The United States should do away with the penny.
1.1. Con: Charities [benefit](https://bizfluent.com/about-7554031-benefits-keeping-penny.html) from pennies, as more people are willing to give them away.
1.2. Pro: Coining pennies costs more than they are worth.
1.2.1. Pro: In 2016, a penny cost [1.50 cents](http://time.com/money/4618271/penny-cost-make-worth/) to produce. That year, the US minted [9.118 billion](https://www.usmint.gov/about/production-sales-figures/circulating-coins-production?program=Circulating+Coins&+50StateQuartersyears=&+WestwardJourneyNickelSeries%E2%84%A2years=&+PresidentialOneDollaryears=&+DistrictofColumbiaandUSTerritoriesQuartersyears=&+AmericatheBeautifulQuarters%C2%AEyears=&+CirculatingCoinsyears=772) pennies, resulting in a $60 million loss.
1.2.2. Con: Without pennies, the US would have to mint more [nickels](http://www.coinnews.net/2018/02/26/penny-costs-1-82-cents-to-make-in-2017/), which cost even more to make.
1.2.3. Pro: Given that inflation will continue, the relative worth of a penny will decrease indefinitely. The only question is when to get rid of them. Many people feel that time is now.
1.3. Pro: Zinc and copper mining is bad for the environment.
1.3.1. Pro: By eliminating and then collecting pennies from circulation, coins could be melted down and recycled for other uses, further reducing the need for mining.
1.4. Pro: People do not really need pennies anymore.
1.4.1. Con: Until a consistent and enforceable plan to adjust pricing culture is adopted, consumers do need pennies if completing transactions in cash.
1.4.2. Con: Unless we regulate prices and taxes to ensure that all costs end in a 5 or a 0, there will be some need in cash transactions for the penny.
1.5. Con: Prices will rise.
1.5.1. Con: Rounding up and down levels out the prices.
1.5.1.1. Con: Shop keepers have more incentive to round up than round down.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Rounding up or down follows [mathematical rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding) irrespective of the incentive for shop keepers.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Prices can be set to encourage rounding up, and the setting of prices is based on the shop keeper.
1.5.2. Pro: One [study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40326060?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) found that a so-called "rounding tax" would cost taxpayers $600 million per year.
1.5.2.1. Pro: This will disproportionately affect the poor, who make more small purchases and literally need to "count their pennies."
1.5.3. Pro: One study in Canada, where the penny has been eliminated, suggests that retailers can manipulate prices to assure rounding up \(and profit taking\) on "single purchase items." [penny-rounding-profits](http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2017/12/18/money-profits-retail-penny-ends-rounding-begins-profits-made/)
1.5.3.1. Con: The same article admits that, "purchases of three or more items makes the outcome difficult to predict and likely results in no benefit to the store of 'rounding'."
1.5.3.2. Pro: The article linked above points out that the Canadian Retail Council suggests "anecdotal evidence that penny rounding works out to a 50-50 equation, or zero net benefit," when viewed on a large scale.
1.6. Con: People are emotionally attached to the penny coin.
1.6.1. Con: Emotions should not dictate a country's monetary policy.
1.6.2. Pro: The penny is the gateway currency for young children, and the prettiest of the American coins. No other coin is shiny like a new penny.
1.7. Con: The penny is a symbol of the United States.
1.7.1. Con: This is not a practical reason to keep the penny.
1.7.2. Pro: Pennies honor the legacy of Abraham Lincoln.
1.7.2.1. Con: Lincoln is also on the $5 bill, so he continues to be honored.
1.7.3. Con: The penny is no more a symbol of the United States than any of the country's other [discontinued coins and bills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsolete_denominations_of_United_States_currency).
1.8. Pro: Some countries have already banned one-cent and other low-value coins entirely.
1.8.1. Pro: [Canada](https://www.mint.ca/store/mint/about-the-mint/phasing-out-the-penny-6900002#.WYaDFFGQxaR) got rid of the penny in 2012, estimating it would save taxpayers $11 million per year.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Canada "suggests" rounding up or down to the nearest nickel for cash transactions while continuing to allow exact payment with credit cards and checks.
