Discussion Title: Should we disband the VA and privatize the benefits through a voucher system?

1. Should we disband the VA and privatize the benefits through a voucher system?
1.1. Con: We would have to trust the confidential information of our entire veteran community to private industry, increasing the chance for identity theft.
1.2. Con: We are already heavily invested in the VA with infrastructure and personnel. Closing the department would mean throwing that money away.
1.3. Con: People are going to be put out of work.
1.4. Con: Just because the system isn't working doesn't mean that we can't fix what we already have.
1.5. Con: There's no reason to give yet another government program over to private industry in order to give profits to Corporate America.
1.6. Pro: Removing the barriers between patients and care providers will have positive results on the medical side of the VA. Currently the waiting periods at the VA are literally killing people.
1.7. Pro: Removing barriers between disabled veterans and their hard earned compensation is a good thing. Currently the VA has a horrible track record with disabilities.
1.8. Pro: The bureaucracy wall of the VA is so high that their is an entire field of people that are paid by the government to navigate the inner workings of that machine. This is the government paying both to fill the hole and dig the hole at the same time.
1.9. Pro: Recently the educational benefits have been 2-3 months late for veterans that have had to go into debt and pay interest on that debt to pay rent. If this was being handled by private industry, this would have been fixed by now. But since it's the VA it's considered withing normal parameters.
1.10. Pro: Claiming that people will lose jobs is no reason to keep throwing away money on a bad investment. Keeping the bureaucracy alive out of sentiment doesn't help veterans.
