Discussion Title: Is Spanking a Child Abusive?

1. Spanking a child is abusive
1.1. Pro: Spanking a child sends the message that it is OK to be physically harmed by another.
1.1.1. Pro: It is wrong to violate the rights of another human being.
1.1.1.1. Con: We do authorize use of force on adults. Our structures place parents in a comparable role to children as legitimate government to an adult.
1.1.2. Con: This is an appeal to consequences. In which while it could be raised as reason not to spank, it does not in itself prove that it should be thought of as abuse.
1.1.2.1. Con: Abuse is defined as "any act or failure to act by a parent or other caregiver that results in actual or potential harm to a child". The definition takes into account the potential consequences of the act, not only the act itself. Sending the signal that it is ok to be harmed certainly increases the risk of the child being hurt in the future.
1.1.3. Con: Over his future life, a child will encounter physical violence. It is teaching him how to deal with it.
1.1.3.1. Con: Resorting to violence as an adult is a criminal offense, and most parents don't want their children to grow up to be criminals.
1.1.4. Pro: Having been abused in the past has a [high correlation](https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/effects-child-abuse-and-neglect-adult-survivors) to accepting future abuse.
1.1.4.1. Con: This is not relevant to the question of whether spanking is or is not abuse in the first place, which must be proven in order for this to be relevant at all.
1.1.5. Con: Spanking a child, similarly as yelling, sends no message on its own, it only amplifies the message that what the child did is very wrong.
1.1.6. Con: Spanking does not bring physical harm. A swat on an appropriate body part with the right object does no harm.
1.1.7. Pro: A moral society considers physical punishment abhorrent. This is not different when the recipient is a child.
1.1.8. Pro: A child hit repeatedly has a higher percentage of [being a bully](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spanking-bully/spanking-your-kid-could-hatch-a-bully-idUSTRE63B2XR20100412) at school. Thus, passing on the message that it is OK to hit others, and in turn was given to that child when hit by their parent.
1.1.8.1. Con: This contains both the group universally accepted as abused and those who are appropriately/only spanked. So this study doesn't represent the argument at hand. Specifically that spanking alone is abuse.
1.1.8.2. Con: Correlation is not causation. Children who bully are [higher in disagreeableness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178915000087?via%3Dihub), which means they are also more likely to break rules and be spanked.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: This study is based on correlations and assumes causation \(As Pychometrics studies generally do\).
1.2. Pro: By definition, spanking is abuse.
1.2.1. Pro: The [American Psychiatric Association defined abuse](http://displus.sk/DSM/subory/dsm5.pdf) as “non-accidental acts of physical force that have resulted—or have reasonable potential to result—in physical harm or have caused significant fear; and verbal or symbolic acts with the potential to cause psychological harm.”
1.2.1.1. Con: Without further data, there is nothing that links this to spanking: as it is unlikely to result in any level of physical harm or cause significant fear, unless the practitioner is using excessive force- which would be a different issue entirely.
1.2.1.2. Con: And yet, spanking can be appropriate... [time.com](http://time.com/3387226/spanking-can-be-an-appropriate-form-of-child-discipline/)
1.2.2. Pro: Research demonstrates that spanking counts as abuse. [www.bostonglobe.com](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2016/04/27/study-spanking-nearly-detrimental-abuse/X44bY3WymbVSv9LSRrKLWL/story.html)
1.2.2.1. Con: This is a misrepresentation of what the article claimed. It did not say that spanking 'counts as abuse'- but brought attention to the reality that it could possibly share some of the negative effects of such to a lesser degree.
1.2.3. Pro: The [top English language dictionary](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-English-dictionary) defines abuse as
["Treat with cruelty or violence, especially regularly or repeatedly."](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/abuse)
and [other top dictionaries](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/abuse) agree that cruelty and/or violence are the key terms for abuse.
1.2.3.1. Con: For this to be relevant, one must start with the presumption that spanking is either cruel or violent, while neither is inherently a part of such.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Abuse is defined as "treat with cruelty or violence, especially regularly or repeatedly." A spank can be non-harmful, non-painful \(such as a light tap\), and used infrequently. A spank can be a sudden physical indicator that a boundary has been transgressed, without pain, and without undue shock.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Every study that restricted their definition of spanking to "[open-handed swats on the bottom](https://www.fatherly.com/parenting/meet-scientists-havent-given-spanking/)", did not find any harmful effects of spanking.
1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: A study failing to find that a practice is harmful is not the same thing as the study proving that the practice is non-harmful. Since every other form of physical violence towards children is harmful, it is plausible that open-handed slaps on the bottom are also harmful and the sample size was insufficient to prove this.
1.2.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: 4 out of the 5 studies found spanking to be "[tied for first place](https://www.fatherly.com/parenting/meet-scientists-havent-given-spanking/) as the most effective way to enforce cooperation with timeout in defiant 2- to 6-year-olds".
1.2.3.2. Con: Spanking children is not regular and you do not intend to be cruel or violent.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: No definition of abuse requires regularity.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: Abuse can exist without intent.
1.2.4. Pro: Spanking and corporal punishments are a form of violence and therefore by definition abusive.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Violence should not be considered a preferable way of resolving conflicts in any social structure, wether its coalitions, states or the smallest and most fundamental cornerstone of society the family. Trust and respect are healthier adhesives than fear when it comes to keeping social structures together.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: This does not contradict spanking as the absolute last resort when children willingly cross boundaries because of knowing that no one can physically stop them. One can spank their child in extreme circumstances \(which hopefully never arise, ore arise extremely rarely\), so violence in that case would never be the preferable way.
1.2.4.2. Con: Violence is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as: Behaviour involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something. \([en.oxforddictionaries.com](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/violence)\). The intention for spanking is often for discipline and as a physical warning, and often not to hurt, damage or kill. Therefore, the claim that it is a form of violence is a false claim.
1.2.5. Con: There exist non-abusive forms of spanking.
1.2.6. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.
1.3. Con: Spanking is not abuse. Some children require harsher consequences than simple verbal reprimanding.
1.3.1. Pro: Some children only respond positively to physical reprimand.
1.3.1.1. Con: In some cases children actually don't respond to any other method than violence. But it's not because they were born this way, but because they were raised this way. When we are at the point in which a child understands only beating, then it means that the fault is in the former deeds of the child's parents.
1.3.1.2. Con: Physical harm does have an immediate effect which can sometimes be positive in the short term \(eg. shooting a child in the leg, that is about to run in front of a moving vehicle will have the positive effect that the child will not die\). This does not mean shooting \(or punching, or smacking\) is not abusive.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: This is a straw-man argument, as very few would consider ever shooting a child. There is a key difference between shooting and spanking: spanking is considered by some to be a "[fair disciplinary measure](https://www.kialo.com/is-spanking-a-child-abusive-6194/settings?back=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kialo.com%2Fis-spanking-a-child-abusive-6194%2F6194.0%3D6194.1-6194.157%2B6194.201-6194.497%2F-6194.497%2Fnew-con)".
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: It is not a straw man argument. It demonstrates the use of the exact same argument provided by the parent thesis and hence undermines the conclusion of the parent thesis.
1.3.2. Con: "No study has found that physical punishment enhances developmental health."
[Page 1 - Key Points](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/early/2012/02/06/cmaj.101314)
1.3.2.1. Con: It's not about developmental health. It's about social conditioning.
1.3.3. Con: A harsh consequence does not need to be spanking. Being denied privileges could be one alternative. "Harsh consequence" is off course different per child.
1.3.4. Con: But there are other forms of punishment other than verbal reprimands, such as taking away their hobbies for a week.
1.3.4.1. Con: You can't reliably take their hobby away for a week unless the hobby requires your presence or some object you can put under a lock.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Hobbies are just one example of a spanking alternative. A parent or guardian will choose what works for that child.
1.3.4.2. Con: Taking away a hobby for a week might be even more stressful for a child. Teaching a child that physical pain is the worst punishment is questionable at best.
1.3.5. Con: Abuse is any behaviour or action designed to control, intimidate, threaten, or injure another person. Spanking fulfills all of these criteria.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Any misuse, manipulation, or exploitation of power for the purpose of controlling the behaviours, actions, thoughts, or feelings of another person is abuse.[herizonhouse.com](https://www.herizonhouse.com/about/what-is-abuse/)
1.3.5.2. Con: Spanking is not designed to injure. A swat on the right part of the body with an appropriate object will not injure.
1.3.5.3. Con: It is not designed to intimidate, threaten, control, injure, etc. Physical punishment is a discipline, done out of love, so that the child doesn't go through pain later in life from not learning that message.
1.3.6. Con: [Wikipedia defines physical abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse) as, "any intentional act causing injury or trauma to another person or animal by way of bodily contact". Therefore "spanking" \(aka "hitting"\) is abuse.
1.4. Con: Spanking a child is a disciplinary measure, not abuse.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.4.2. Pro: Simply spanking a child isn’t an act of child abuse. It would be considered child abuse if further actions are taken that is on a different magnitude of violence.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Spanking a child is not abusive if it is done out of love and not anger and used as a last resort.  If done correctly, it will not have to happen often.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: A child who grows-up associating spanking with "love" is more likely to accept various forms of violence from an intimate partner because they deem it just and an expression of how much their partner "loves" them. This is especially true if the spanking was done father-to-daughter [womensenews.org](https://womensenews.org/2001/09/experts-say-harms-children/).
1.4.2.1.2. Con: Spanking does not have to be a last resort, when someone is out of solutions there are other people that can help and in many developed countries their are institutions that offer help as well
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: Some children learn the first time that spanking is uncomfortable, so they curb certain behaviors so they will not experience it again.
1.4.2.1.3.1. Con: Spanking may just make the child fearful of the parent, instead of learning a lesson about certain behaviors.
1.4.2.1.3.2. Con: This doesn't teach the child that what they did was wrong, but rather to avoid discomfort.
1.4.2.2. Con: Abuse suggests a difference in power. The difference in physical strength makes spanking abusive.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: You don't need a physical difference in strength in order to be capable of abuse.
1.4.3. Pro: Spanking reinforces empathy and gives a child a reason to think twice before doing something foolish.
1.4.3.1. Con: The child learns not to think in a empathic or respectul way before doing a action. The child lears to think in a egoistic way: obeying to avoid punishment. And if it is possible to do something foolish without getting caught, the child will not see any reason to avoid doing it.
1.4.3.2. Pro: In an otherwise supportive and caring family environment, spanking teaches a child that refusal to adhere to rules has extreme consequences.
1.4.3.3. Con: Spanking [creates behavior problems](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/spanking-linked-to-increase-in-childrens-behavior-problems.html) in young children.
1.4.4. Pro: Spanking is not experienced as abusive for children of a personality type that prefers an honest and personal response.
1.4.5. Pro: When the limits of when, why and how are predetermined, understood, predictable and consistent between parent and child, spanking can be a beneficial means of discipline.
1.4.6. Con: Disciplinary measures and abuse are not mutually exclusive. A disciplinary measure can go too far and therefore also be abuse.
1.4.6.1. Pro: The severity of punishment dictates the difference between discipline and abuse. Physical punishment should not be routine but is not always abuse. Verbal or mental torture can be far worse and leave worse scars that a swat on the butt.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Spanking can be abusive when it is overused, done out of frustration, or without love communicated effectively.
1.4.7. Con: If a child is old enough to reason, reason should be used. If a child is not old enough to reason then they won't understand the reason they are being hit.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Small children are usually not mentally mature enough to understand punishment in general.
1.4.7.2. Con: You don't have to know the reason why something happens to know that it is something to be avoided.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: Finding a better future approach is generally more successful if you understand why the old approach was ineffective.
1.4.7.2.2. Pro: Fear is a sufficient motivator to avoid certain behaviours.
1.4.7.2.3. Con: Often children resort to negative behaviors because they don't know what to do instead. Spanking doesn't teach them what to do instead.
1.4.7.2.4. Con: However, if you don't know the reason why something happens, then you are ill equipped to avoid it in the future.
1.4.8. Con: There are better tools that can be used to help children behave well.
1.4.8.1. Pro: A child could be removed from a situation instead of spanked. After constantly being removed from the same situation, the child could learn to avoid it in the future.
1.4.8.2. Pro: Sometimes the reason a child is spanked is an external factor that is not the child's fault. Parents could remove them from the environment that would lead a child to be spanked in the first place.
1.4.8.2.1. Pro: An unhealthy diet or lack of exercise lead children to be hyper in situations where they should be calm \(such as a classroom or going to sleep\).
1.4.8.2.2. Pro: A stimulus \(something that triggers an emotion, like seeing ice cream\) would make a child react to it in a way that a parent would not like \(the parent might not want the child eating ice cream\). If the child avoids the stimulus \(not going near the ice cream aisle in grocery stores\), a reaction will not occur and not require punishment for it.
1.4.8.2.3. Pro: Not exposing a child to safety hazards is better than spanking. The reasons are that they could be punished less and avoid injury simultaneously. Instead, dangers should be made foolproof until the child understands to avoid them.
1.4.8.3. Pro: Leading children in a positive direction is better than punishing them for going in a negative direction.
1.4.8.3.1. Pro: A positive direction could be to teach them to succeed. Then they would avoid many failures that would cause them to be punished.
1.4.8.3.2. Pro: Parents being a role model could inspire a child to have positive behaviors than negative ones. Since the parents already approve of the behaviors, less spanking occurs.
1.4.8.3.3. Pro: If a child is doing something inappropriate, substitute it with an approved activity \(such as taking away a candy bar and showing them an apple\) and an explanation of why the new activity is better.
1.4.8.4. Pro: There is sufficient psychological and child developmental literature that points to a method of corporal punishment that does not produce long term psychological trauma and at the same time is effective in eliciting corrective behavior.

[goodparent.org](https://goodparent.org/corporal-punishment/research-on-corporal-punishment/evidence-favoring-the-use-of-disciplinary-spanking/)
1.4.8.5. Pro: [Time out](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-children-discipline/time-out-better-than-spanking-for-naughty-kids-experts-idUSL2392676720070124) has higher efficacy than hitting the child.
1.4.8.5.1. Con: Some children do not respond to time-outs.
1.4.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.
1.4.8.7. Pro: Consistently spanking children \(even lightly\) could be considered emotional/psychological abuse since it is used as a substitute for TALKING and TEACHING the young humans which is an integral aspect of parental responsibility.
1.4.8.8. Con: What works for one child may not work for another. Therefore, hitting or spanking a child can be considered a useful tool for some children over alternative methods.
1.4.8.8.1. Pro: Some children respond better to physical discipline than others. Its best practice for the parent to gauge what disciplinary action suits their child.
1.4.8.9. Con: Spanking a child or smacking their hand is one of many tools in a Parent's toolbox. Using this tool reinforces the behavior or actions as unacceptable, after a child continues their actions or behaviors, when other tools like discussion, time outs, grounding, loss of privileges, etc. have already been used.
1.4.8.9.1. Con: Calling something a tool does not necessarily mean it's not abuse.
1.4.8.9.2. Con: Calling something a tool does not legitimize its use. Nuclear weapons are tools, too, but are not acceptable to use against misbehaving children.
1.4.9. Pro: Hitting a child shows clearly the borders of permissible activity. This helps the child to better understand borders.
1.4.9.1. Con: Spanking is a form of controlling another person's actions. Limiting a child's capabilities could be detrimental to them growing up. They might not have the skills to succeed as an adult.
1.4.9.2. Con: Most parents do not consider hitting to be in the borders of permissible activity. Hitting a child implies that hitting is acceptable and is thus counterproductive.
1.4.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.4.9.3. Con: -> See 1.4.8.
1.4.9.4. Pro: Spanking children teaches them that there are consequences for there actions.
1.4.9.5. Con: [Children who are spanked have been shown to be more likely to be aggressive to others in the future.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4904830/) This indicates that hitting a child reduces their understanding of borders around physical violence and is thus a poor disciplinary measure.
1.4.9.5.1. Pro: It is known, as confirmed by studies, that spanking in early development seems to correlate strongly with mental health problems on adulthood. This suggests that spanking has long-term consequences on the child, even increasing rates of suicide and drug consumption. "They found that spanking was associated \(...\) including increased aggression and behavioral and mental health problems as well as reduced cognitive ability and self-esteem." [What Science Says—and Doesn't—about Spanking](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-science-says-and-doesn-t-about-spanking/)
1.4.9.5.2. Con: Aggression is essential for survival. Children should be raised to be strong not weak and sensitive to the pressures that the world presents to them.
1.4.9.5.2.1. Con: [Aggression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/201106/the-paradox-anger-strength-or-weakness) is not synonymous with strength, and in fact can be a sign of emotional weakness and insecurity.
1.4.9.5.2.1.1. Pro: [Aggression in children](https://childmind.org/article/aggression-in-children-causes/) can be a sign of frustration, psychosis, difficulty coping with life experiences, or medical issues. If untreated, it can lead to aggressive disorders later on in life.
1.4.9.5.2.1.2. Con: If a person cannot be aggressive they cannot compete in society. Moderation is needed of course but some sense of aggression is a must.
1.4.9.5.2.1.2.1. Con: A person can be successful in society with assertiveness. Aggression from being spanked as a child is not a necessary component.
1.4.9.6. Con: There has been a [demonstrated correlation](http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476\(17\)31377-X/fulltext) between being spanked and committing/accepting domestic violence in later relationships.
1.4.10. Con: -> See 1.4.9.5.
1.4.11. Con: Children should be taught responsibility for their actions, not discipline based on fear of punishment.
1.4.12. Pro: Corporal punishment is sometimes required to protect young children, particularly those who don't respond to verbal warnings, from immediate/dangerous situations.
1.4.12.1. Pro: Just like strong discipline teaches your pet to avoid dangerous acts by associating pain/discomfort before real harm is done \(e.g. spanking your dog not to run across a busy road\), so does corporal punishment potentially save your child from fatal outcomes.
1.4.12.1.1. Con: When training dogs, negative reinforcement is less effective and widely used than other methods.
1.4.12.1.1.1. Pro: Many organisations are [moving away from negative reinforcement](https://thehappypuppysite.com/the-evidence-for-positive-reinforcement-training-in-dogs/), including Search and rescue, Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, and bomb disposal.
1.4.12.1.1.2. Pro: Most recent studies find negative reinforcement is not the best method for training dogs.
1.4.12.1.1.2.1. Pro: A study from 2004 showed that dogs trained with more rewards showed [higher levels of obedience](http://expeng.anr.msu.edu/sites/animalwelfare/files/Training_Methods_\(Hiby,_2004\).pdf), and that dogs trained with more punishment exhibited more problem behaviours.
1.4.12.1.1.2.2. Pro: A 2008 study showed that dogs trained using positive reinforcement were [less likely to show aggression and fear](http://www.journalvetbehavior.com/article/S1558-7878\(07\)00276-6/abstract) than dogs trained using punitive methods, and another 2008 study found that [even non-physical punishment](http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591\(08\)00371-7/abstract) \(for example ‘staring at a dog’ or making a growling noise at him\) increased levels of aggression and fear.
1.4.12.1.1.2.3. Pro: A 2010 study from the applied animal behaviour journal found a correlation between more frequent use of punishment and [excitement/aggression](http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591\(10\)00026-2/abstract).
1.4.12.1.1.3. Con: No form of positive reinforcement can replace negative reinforcement in dangerous situations. Teaching your dog to wait before crossing the street does not teach it not to run across due to a greater distraction than the reward positive reinforcement provides. Only when the dog associates pain with crossing the road unauthorisedly will it learn not to do it.
1.4.12.1.1.3.1. Con: Police and Military working dogs work in very dangerous situations, but are almost always [trained using positive reinforcement](https://www.forces.net/news/tri-service/hero-hounds-training-behind-military-working-dogs).
1.4.12.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The trainer cited says "I’m not 100% pure positive; I sometimes need to use an emergency brake \(such as a verbal reprimand or leash correction\)" but I no longer use aversives as a teaching tool.” This shows that while physical action is sometimes needed for safety, it's not used for training. This fits the child crossing the road situation: physical action can be needed to stop the child walking in front of traffic, but shouldn't be used to train behaviour after the immediate danger is over.
1.4.12.1.2. Pro: When using a corporal measure to dissuade a child from an action that would have caused pain/damage, the child will associate pain/discomfort with that certain source of danger.
1.4.12.1.2.1. Pro: In the same way that touching a hot pan means the child will not likely do it again, smacking the child for attempting it will create a valuable association between touching the hot pan and pain.
1.4.13. Pro: Children need to be ready for a tough world where they might be attacked. Moderate physical discipline makes them ready for whatever comes their way.
1.4.13.1. Con: There are [combat sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport) and even [commercial combat training](https://www.combattrainingcenter.nl/) available for when a child or someone needs to learn what physical attack is.
1.4.13.1.1. Pro: People who provide commercial training professionally are often more experienced and can do a better job at this than most parents.
1.4.13.1.2. Con: Combat sports does not prepare a child for real world physical attack, which is unpredictable in nature.
1.4.13.1.2.1. Con: Combat sports and training do lead to, for both children and adults, an improved ability to defend themselves in combat, higher endurance, increased physical strength, more accurate expectations of what a physical attack could be like and faster response times. All of these can really help someone during a physical attack.
1.4.13.1.2.2. Con: In such case, spanking does not prepare for physical attack either, since it's supposed to be predictable.
1.4.13.2. Con: According to this logic, parents should also starve their children regularly, because "they must be ready for whatever comes their way".
1.4.13.3. Con: Adults are bigger, stronger and more informed than children. If we cannot show them how to resolve conflicts, without resorting to violence, then we are not preparing them for whatever comes their way; we are only preparing them to be gladiators. Might = right.
1.4.14. Con: Hitting a child as a form of punishment/discipline is a laziness/weakness by the parent for utilizing a negative mental/physical disciplinary measure in hopes of creating a positive influence on the child's life, as opposed to using the child's negative action as a cause for a positive disciplinary/teaching moment to positively influence the child's life.
1.4.14.1. Pro: Spanking places the blame of neglectful parenting onto the child when they do something out-of-line
1.4.15. Pro: Children obey short term, therefore parents will be less frustrated and better parents. This also benefits the child.
1.4.15.1. Con: It's often too easy for a parent to cross the line into abuse by getting themselves too carried away by their own anger, often over something very benign and not even worthy of disciplinary consequences \(e.g. spilling a glass of milk.\)
1.4.15.2. Con: Spanking might lead to short term obedience but, in childhood, is also associated with:

1.5. Pro: Initiating physical violence against anyone without consent is assault and battery, and a violation of natural rights. These rights are not dependent on age.
1.5.1. Con: A parent needs to have control over their child in order to protect the child from it's own \(potential\) actions. Therefore, when a child inflicts physical violence on it's parents, the parent has to be allowed to discipline the child with equal or greater force in order to maintain the hierarchy of power.
1.5.1.1. Con: If the parent responds to abuse with abuse, the circle of violence cannot be broken. By employing violence the parent legitimises its use as a means, and therefore giving the wrong example of how to resolve conflicts.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Violence is a last resort method. Sometimes a last resort method is needed. That isn't setting a bad example of how to resolve conflicts, and it isn't wrong to legitimise violence as a last resort method of resolving a conflict.
1.5.1.2. Con: The parent can have control over the child without using violence.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Parents who fixate on control, and view their child's autonomy as a threat, are forgetting that children already completely depend on adults. This can escalate into a form of [psychological abuse](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201602/10-signs-narcissistic-parent).
1.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: Overly authoritarian parenting has been shown to increase a child's desire for rebellion, [harming the relationship between parent and child and increasing the risk for behavioral problems like alcohol abuse.](https://www.parentingscience.com/authoritarian-parenting.html)
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: The [authoritative parenting style](https://www.parentingscience.com/authoritative-parenting-style.html) takes a firm stand with rules, but uses positive reinforcement and reasoning to guide children instead of threats or punishments.
1.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: Kids raised by authoritative parents [are more likely](https://www.parentingscience.com/authoritative-parenting-style.html) to become independent, self-reliant, socially accepted, academically successful, and well-behaved, and are less likely to report depression and anxiety, or engage in antisocial behaviour like delinquency and drug use.
1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.5.3. Con: Natural rights are social constructs that have bearing only on those wishing to profess them.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Natural rights [first appeared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights#History) in ancient greek philosophy.
1.5.3.2. Con: Some rights are professed by a very large number of people and states. "The inherent dignity \[...\] of all members of the human family" [is stated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights#Contemporary) in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by 48 states in 1948.
1.5.4. Pro: "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent". Isaac Asimov. [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov)
1.5.4.1. Con: Many competent people have used violence.
1.5.4.2. Con: Someone else's unsubstantiated opinion is not an argument.
1.5.4.3. Con: The Isaac Asimov character quote only represents the bias of the author, and has no empirical basis.
1.5.5. Con: Consent is not always required. Police can initiate physical violence upon an offender even if the offender hadn't initiated physical violence upon anyone prior to that.
1.5.6. Pro: The target of an action does not change whether or not that action is violent.
1.5.7. Pro: Children are people, and therefore their bodily autonomy should be respected.
1.5.7.1. Con: Parents do "own" children. They aren't afforded full Constitutional rights and parent's are responsible for the actions of the child, in effect making it incumbent upon a parent to enforce discipline in whatever manner works short of abuse.
1.5.7.1.1. Con: Having responsibility for something is not the same thing as owning that thing.
1.5.7.2. Pro: Parents do not "own" children just because they gave birth to them.
1.5.7.3. Con: A child's bodily autonomy may be abridged by, for example, pulling a child out of the middle of the street to prevent damage to the child. Introducing minor, current discomfort to prevent greater, future discomfort is in the child's best interest. Spanking may be conceived as this, helping to curtail behaviors that will be detrimental to the child.
1.5.7.3.1. Con: Preventing a child from harming itself or others in an acute situation is not the same as punishing it after such a situation has been resolved. In the first case, the parent has no choice. In the latter case, they have.
1.5.7.4. Pro: Children are not inherently bad and deserving of punishment.
1.5.7.4.1. Pro: Children may not understand the consequences of their actions, or have ill-intent. They therefore should not be subjected to punishment.
1.5.7.4.2. Con: Spanking is a correction for disobedience, not a punishment. Children are at time in need of correction.
1.5.8. Con: Violence is the final step in conflict escalation in any situation, whether between children or adults, and is important lesson in understanding the cost of refusing to find compromise.
1.5.8.1. Con: This does not teach the cost of refusing to find compromise, rather that physical force can be used to get your way.

The cost of refusing to find compromise as a child should not be getting spanked. When a child grows up and physically stronger, the imbalance of physical power between parent and child will change. If thought incorrectly, so will the power dynamic in arguments.
1.5.8.2. Con: Violence is not always the cost nor the absolute result of refusing to find a compromise.
1.5.8.3. Con: Parents should teach children conflict deescalation, not escalation. Avoiding physical punishment is an important piece of this.
1.5.8.4. Con: Adults should be role models. A big part of being a role model is showing how to treat others with respect and how to lead with responsibility. Parents who hit their children abuse their role as an authority figure and therefore do not set a positive example for a mutually respectful relationship between two people of different hierarchical status.
1.5.8.5. Con: [Assault and battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_and_battery) include the threat of violent and then the physical act. A parent threatening a child with a spanking to make them comply and then following through with it falls within this category, making it [physical abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse)-not conflict resolution.
1.5.9. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.6. Con: A slap on the behind can send a clear signal to a child that it has crossed a line. However a slap in the face is much more intimate and distressing.
1.6.1. Con: It surely sends a clear signal but it has a negative impact on the child's future. [The outcome of a spanking is almost equal to the outcome of an outright abuse.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2016/04/27/study-spanking-nearly-detrimental-abuse/X44bY3WymbVSv9LSRrKLWL/story.html) Therefore, how or where you hit the child is irrelevant as long as you hit the child.
1.7. Pro: Spanking has been recognised as having long term detrimental effects on mental health. [news.umich.edu](https://news.umich.edu/childhood-spankings-can-lead-to-adult-mental-health-problems/)
1.8. Con: Abusive disciplinary measures for children \(physical or not\) are detrimental to the child. Non-abusive spanking is possible and [research shows](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026473020315) that it can bring beneficial outcomes.
1.8.1. Con: The study found that "five of eight longitudinal studies that controlled for initial child misbehaviour found predominantly detrimental outcomes of spanking".
1.8.1.1. Con: This [meta-study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026473020315) suggests that detrimental outcomes of spanking are "primarily due to overly frequent use of physical punishment". This could mean that only the more extreme versions of spanking \(too much force, too often\) come with detrimental effects, and that spanking is not harmful if done lightly.
1.8.2. Con: This meta-study chose an arbitrary \(and undisclosed without purchasing\) definition of what they consider as "abusive spanking", and excluded 37 \(leaving 38\) based on that measure.
1.8.3. Con: The [definition of physical abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse) is: "any intentional act causing injury or trauma to another person or animal by way of bodily contact." Therefore ALL spanking is abusive and "non-abusive spanking" is an illogical statement.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Spanking is traumatizing.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: Spanking creates symptoms of its own such as avoidance behaviors.
1.8.3.1.1.1. Pro: Childhood emotional abuse \(CEA\), which can come about from spanking, is shown to create [experiential avoidance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4493441/) behaviors later on in a child's life.
1.8.3.1.2. Pro: Spanking a child most likely leads to negative results. Thousands of children \(and some adults\) have been studied to get this result. In a recent meta analysis \(when researches look at a bunch of earlier research\), it was found that although a short term positive response was observed, the long term effects lasted much longer and were almost always negative. [Source](http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/dmessinger/c_c/rsrcs/rdgs/emot/spanging.meta.2016.jFamPsych.pdf)
1.8.3.1.3. Pro: There is [scientific evidence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201802/the-spanking-debate-is-over) \(scroll down for literature\) from a number of studies showing that spanking has mostly negative effects on both child and parents.
1.8.3.1.4. Pro: Spanking and abuse have been shown to have the same long term effects on a child's attitude and personality.
[news.utexas.edu](https://news.utexas.edu/2016/04/25/risks-of-harm-from-spanking-confirmed-by-researchers)
1.8.3.1.5. Con: Spanking intensity is hugely varied, and studies which condemn spanking include the most violent types of spanking in the same category as light spanking.
1.8.3.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.8.3.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.1.
1.8.3.1.6. Con: Hitting a child on the bottom with the flat of the hand once does no lasting physical damage.
1.8.3.1.6.1. Con: Parents are a child's protectors. When they betray that trust, it often leads to depression. Contrary to popular belief, fear and sadness do cause [physical damage](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/effects-on-body).
1.8.3.1.7. Con: The hegemonic discourse on physical punishment in a given society can sometimes determine whether or not the child gets traumatized or not. This differs from culture to culture. When children from a "spanking culture" move to a country where spanking is classified as child abuse, the child can actually become more traumatized by the shame it brings as their parents suddenly are considered to be criminals in the new country.
1.8.3.1.7.1. Con: Even if this is true, this does not show that children are better off in a culture which tolerates physical violence towards them when you take everything into account. At a minimum you must also factor in the likelihood that children are beaten less when they move to a culture which does not tolerate beating children and that this is beneficial for the child.
1.9. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.
1.10. Pro: Violence as punishment \(often spankings\) used to be legal towards servants and wives as well who at the time [were both legal minors](https://archive.org/stream/introductiontoro00leeruoft#page/64/mode/2up/search/she+is+deemed+to+be+a+minor). That was an abuse of power, using violence against children is no different.
1.11. Pro: Spanking is recognized as child abuse in many countries.
1.11.1. Con: The popularity of idea has no bearing on its morality. It doesn't matter how many nations adopt anti-spanking laws, that number doesn't weight on the morality of it.
1.11.2. Pro: In many countries, it is [forbidden](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/02/01/spanking-law_n_9133170.html) by law to spank a child.
1.11.2.1. Con: Whether or not one or many countries do or do not forbid something by law does not have any bearing on whether or not the action is or is not abuse. Such is an appeal to authority.
1.11.2.2. Con: This arguments' inference that because 'many countries' do something it qualifies as abuse is an argumentum ad populum- the reasoning that something should be taken as true not on the merits of the argument itself, but based on the number of people who believe it.
1.11.2.3. Pro: Since Sweden banned all corporal punishment in 1966, [57 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_corporal_punishment_laws#Prohibition) have banned it.
1.11.3. Con: The fact that hitting children is abusive has nothing to do with what any country recognizes in its laws. If no country had ever recognized spanking as abuse, spanking would still be abuse.
1.12. Con: Abuse is often unpredictable and without cause, unlike spanking.
1.12.1. Con: "Predictability" is not part of the definition of abuse.  Whether or not something is predictable has no bearing on whether it's abusive.  \(Though, if anything, abuse tends to shock and surprise the victim, so this is also plain false.\)
1.12.2. Con: Whether or not something is abusive does not depend on whether or not it is a response to something else.
1.12.2.1. Pro: The fact that a child may have stuck their tongue out, or even intentionally hit someone, does not mean that any/all punitive responses possible are non-abusive.  E.g., chopping off their arm would be in response to that cause--and quite obviously horrifically abusive.
1.12.3. Pro: Spanking is a response to a specific misbehavior.
1.12.4. Con: Abuse often does have a pattern and does have a cause.
[Source](https://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/hr/hrdepts/asap/Documents/Domestic_Violence.pdf)
1.12.5. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.
1.12.6. Con: Through manipulation, abuse is sometimes made to [look like a response to a \(fake\) misbehavior](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-41572180).
1.12.7. Con: Abuse is often all too predictable.
1.13. Con: Spanking has been done for centuries without it being considered abuse.
1.13.1. Con: By analogy, slavery existed for quite some time.  This did not make it any less terrible.
1.13.1.1. Con: Slavery and spanking are apples and oranges. Slavery wasn't a punitive action and spanking is a form of discipline.
1.13.2. Pro: Spanking does no damage, and therefore is not abuse.
1.13.2.1. Con: If they grew up wanting to hit children, that is reason to consider whether or not they really did "grow up just fine".
1.13.2.1.1. Con: Its unlikely they grew up wanting to hit children, but rather through conditioning see it as an acceptable form of discipline.
1.13.2.2. Con: Many forms of abuse, large and small, may be survived without a person's whole life being ruined.  This has no bearing on whether or not the actions were abusive--that is, whether or not they were deeply hurtful, and/or the person's life would have been better without them occurring.
1.13.2.3. Con: The majority of parents who were spanked as a child spank their kids.

[Source](https://mgtvwjhl.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/click-here-to-read-the-study.pdf)
1.13.2.4. Con: These people are in the minority compared to those who grew up to exhibit antisocial behaviour and mental health problems.

[Source](https://mgtvwjhl.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/click-here-to-read-the-study.pdf)
1.13.2.5. Pro: For some children, spanking does not seem to have an affect on their behavior or emotional happiness.
1.13.2.6. Pro: Many people experienced spanking in their lifes, are normal, healthy and emotionaly stable and view their punishment as deserved consequence.
1.13.2.6.1. Con: This is similar to Stolkhom syndrome. When you love and respect your parents, its easy to convince yourself that you deserved it.[counsellingresource.com](https://counsellingresource.com/therapy/self-help/stockholm/) [medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Stockholm+syndrome)
1.13.2.7. Con: -> See 1.4.9.6.
1.13.2.8. Con: Spanking has been linked to [lower IQs](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090924231749.htm) in children.
1.13.2.8.1. Con: Correlation does not imply causation. It is conceivable lower IQ children get spanked more due to their misbehavior.
1.13.2.8.1.1. Con: This kind of depends on how high the correlation actually is. This is not fully known yet. More research should also be done to link the correlation between the IQ's of children and parents \(nature\) to \(non\) spanking. If "low IQ not spanking parents" produce high\(er\) IQ offspring and if "high IQ spanking parents" produce low\(er\) IQ children \(nurture\) than average there could be causation to it. IQ is [partly heritable according sources](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/what-relationship-intelligence-genetics-674391). However, how much it exactly is is also unknown.
1.13.2.9. Con: [Spanking](https://www.brookings.edu/research/hitting-kids-american-parenting-and-physical-punishment/) has been associated with anxiety, depression, drug and alcohol abuse later on in life.
1.13.2.10. Con: Previous generations may not have known better, repeating a cycle of abuse that was passed down. Just because its happened before, does not make it acceptable to continue.
1.13.2.10.1. Con: Even if modern studies have shown that spanking is not effective long term, previous spanking should not be considered abuse because it was at that time done under good intentions and was considered by society as the best thing for the child.
1.13.2.10.1.1. Pro: Until these old norms are understood by a society, physical punishment for children should not be considered full on abuse, but just a mis-informed and ineffective attempt at parenting.
1.13.2.10.1.2. Pro: In some countries they have passed [regulations](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424065706/http://endcorporalpunishment.org/progress/prohibiting-states/) or [advice](https://news.vice.com/article/the-french-government-is-telling-citizens-that-spanking-kids-is-bad) letting the population know that physical punishment is not allowed - at that point physical punishment should be considered abuse, but not before.
1.13.2.10.1.2.1. Pro: For example, the government health service \(NHS\) in the UK calls it a [grey area](https://www.nhs.uk/news/pregnancy-and-child/smacking-children-linked-psychological-problems-adulthood/) and only recommends against excessive force.
1.13.3. Con: Whether or not people have applied the label 'abuse' to it in the past or presently doesn't have bearing on the question of 'should spanking be labeled as abusive'.
1.13.4. Pro: Nobody really thought it was abusive until very recently. All through history spanking has worked fine for everyone. There's no good reason as to why that would change now.
1.13.5. Con: -> See 1.13.2.10.
