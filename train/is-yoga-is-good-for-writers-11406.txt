Discussion Title: Is Yoga is Good for Writers?

1. Yoga Is Good For Writers
1.1. Con: To be a good writer takes nothing but hard work.
1.1.1. Pro: Accessing inspiration is simply a question of training.
1.1.2. Pro: Writing is [meant to be scary](https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/why-you-should-be-writing-scared-2/).
1.1.3. Con: Creativity and inspiration strike when they're ready. You can't hurry them.
1.2. Con: Writers don't need to be healthy to write well.
1.2.1. Con: Ill health would surely affect concentration, thought processes, and ultimately the quality of writing.
1.3. Con: The claims made by yoga are [not scientifically proven](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/22/9012075/yoga-health-benefits-exercise-science).
1.3.1. Con: The study cited only says that there is insufficient evidence, not that yoga's claims are wrong.
1.4. Pro: Yoga helps you learn to sit and breathe in a healthy way.
1.4.1. Con: This is more applicable to meditation.
1.4.2. Con: In Gurdjieff's book "[Meetings with Remarkable Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meetings_with_Remarkable_Men)" it is considered unhealthy to practice certain yogic breathing techniques.
1.4.3. Con: It does not necessarily make for good writing to be sitting in a calm way; perhaps pacing around, or dictating would be a better method for writing.
1.4.3.1. Pro: It is entirely about personal preference.
1.4.4. Pro: Calm reflection is always a good mental state to attain; good breathing should be promoted more.
1.5. Pro: Yoga helps you [overcome anxiety](https://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/how-yoga-calms-anxiety-holistically) that [contributes strongly](https://criticalthinkeracademy.com/courses/22120/lectures/315829) to writer's block.
1.5.1. Con: It is better for a writer to be anxious because this helps him or her write more powerfully.
1.5.1.1. Con: This is very unlikely, true anxiety is very debilitating.
1.5.2. Con: It has not been proven that yoga helps anyone overcome anxiety; in fact, it could make anxiety [worse](https://greatist.com/happiness/yoga-can-help-cure-anxiety-can-it-cause-anxiety-too).
1.6. Con: Spending time on yoga is time that could be spent writing, more writing = better writing.
1.7. Con: The term "good" is subjective and not universally applicable to limited terms.
1.8. Con: The connection between yoga and writing is spurious.
1.8.1. Pro: Yoga is a way of living that involves 8 limbs and is akin to a religious practice ; it is therefore not universally applicable to say whether it is good for writers or not, any more than saying "Islam is good for writers".
1.8.2. Pro: Yoga makes some people bored and/or angry and therefore it is not good for them.
1.8.3. Pro: Writing is a craft without a spiritual dimension.
1.8.4. Pro: Yoga is good for balance and sport requiring the suppleness of the body. Writing does not require this; indeed, when dictating, it is not necessary to move at all.
1.9. Pro: Yoga enables you to connect with the source of [your creativity](https://upliftconnect.com/yoga-unlocks-creativity/).
1.9.1. Pro: Yoga is suggested to [help develop empathy](https://pqdtopen.proquest.com/doc/305152469.html?FMT=ABS), which is needed to write believable, sympathetic characters.
1.9.1.1. Con: Empathy is not necessary for writing good characters, in the same way that sociopaths don't need to have empathy to imitate a polite person.
1.9.2. Pro: Yoga enables you to visualise more powerfully, which is extremely valuable for writers.
1.9.2.1. Con: There is no evidence that this is true.
1.9.2.2. Con: Writers by their nature may not be particularly visual, their imagination can come in words; artists are more visually imaginative.
1.9.3. Con: The "source" of a person's creativity is a vague term.
1.9.4. Con: The "source" of someone's creativity may be alcohol \(like Charles Bukowski\) or marijuana \(like Bob Marley\) or any number of other things that do not involve yoga.
1.10. Pro: Yoga can help with focus and patience. It helps people calm their minds down and find inner peace within themselves, overall helping each person become more focused and controlled.
1.11. Pro: Yoga helps you [concentrate for longer](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268437629_EFFECT_OF_YOGA_ON_CONCENTRATION_AND_MEMORY_IN_RELATION_TO_STRESS) and with more intensity.
1.11.1. Con: This is not universally applicable.
1.11.2. Con: Yoga may cause a shortening of attention span, boredom and irritation.
1.11.3. Con: Yoga may not create "focused intensity"; in fact, it may induce "detached peacefulness".
1.12. Pro: Yoga helps you see a writing project as something you do one day at a time, making it less daunting.
1.12.1. Pro: There are programmes and teachings of yoga that can be carefully tailored to the individual's needs and desires; as such, yoga can be channelled to helping writers as much as anybody else.
1.12.2. Con: There is no peer-reviewed and tested proof of this claim.
1.12.3. Con: This is opinion and not fact, at best this can be subjectively true.
1.12.4. Con: Yoga, and the thoughts someone has while doing yoga, are two separate claims and are not related.
1.12.5. Con: It is hyperbole to suggest what people will think when doing an activity and impossible to say any more than saying "playing football will teach people that projects should be taken step by step" which is obviously not true.
