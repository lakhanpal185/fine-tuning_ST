Discussion Title: Did Frank D. Roosevelt save capitalism?

1. FDR saved capitalism.
1.1. Pro: By ensuring that America's poorest had access to basic needs, such as housing and food, the New Deal created the safety net needed for people to pursue capitalist endeavours.
1.1.1. Con: Poor people may have less of an incentive to pursue capitalist endeavors if the state props them up.
1.1.1.1. Con: The economy grew while unemployment and suicide rates dropped significantly following the New Deal, indicating that people became empowered and incentivized to thrive.
1.1.1.2. Con: The state plays a foundational role in economic activity \(for example: the enforcement of private property law\). Capitalism can't exist without the state somehow enabling it.
1.2. Con: Given that the Cold War kicked off just after the end of FDR's tenure, if anything FDR set Capitalism up for its first real opposition.
1.2.1. Con: The Soviet Union existed prior to FDR's terms in office and were already ideologically opposed to capitalism.
1.3. Con: FDR preserved capitalism by introducing anti-capitalist elements into American socioeconomic policy -- he just saved capitalism from itself temporarily.
1.3.1. Con: If FDR's policies saved capitalism temporarily, in order to enable capitalism to somehow thrive in the future, then it is still correct to say that he saved Capitalism.
1.3.1.1. Con: If he used anti-capitalism to mitigate the damages of capitalism, then he didn't save capitalism but instead saved its victims.
1.3.2. Pro: There is an important distinction to be made between 'saving' something and 'preserving' it. For example, you can preserve a cancer patient through various treatments that extend their life, but the cancer might very well still kill them eventually.
1.4. Pro: If FDR hadn't strengthened labor and antitrust in America, communism would have spread there.
1.4.1. Con: The Communist Party of the USA [grew dramatically](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Communist-Party-of-the-United-States-of-America) throughout the 1930s and were largely supportive of New Deal policies.
1.4.2. Con: Communism does not spread because it does not work.
1.4.2.1. Con: This cannot be proven because real attempts at communism have always been thwarted by imperialism.
1.4.2.2. Con: The USSR suggests that Communism does indeed spread.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: The USSR was a socialist \(not communist\) state.
1.5. Pro: FDR saved capitalism by helping defeat fascism.
1.5.1. Pro: Fascist regimes in Germany and Italy were antagonistic to true capitalism, instead instilling a type of "[state capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_fascism#State_capitalism)" or "[corporatism](https://fee.org/articles/economic-fascism/)."
1.5.2. Pro: The Japanese [economy](http://www.grips.ac.jp/teacher/oono/hp/lecture_J/lec09.htm) during the Sh≈çwa era became increasingly state controlled as the military dictatorship consolidated their power.
1.6. Con: Capitalism is the natural economic system of human civilization. It will become the natural order with or without the influence of any single politician.
1.6.1. Con: The example of [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China#Communist_Party), which transitioned from a dynastic to a socialist form of government, suggests otherwise.
1.6.2. Pro: Capitalism is what emerges when human-crafted restrictions, like limits to property rights, are withdrawn, which suggests it is the natural order of things.
1.6.2.1. Con: Limitations can be and are often imposed on property rights through capitalistic market forces.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Indigenous people are often dispossessed of land and resources for the sake of capitalistic endeavors
1.6.3. Con: The concept of 'natural' does not exist when talking about an economic system. Capitalism is a social construct.
1.6.3.1. Pro: As a social construct, every economic system is made by human choices and interests. For this reason, Roosvelt can be considered as the saver of capitalism.
1.7. Pro: FDR's New Deal revived the American economy and restored its capitalist tradition.
1.7.1. Con: The New Deal actually prolonged the great depression.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Most of the jobs created by the New Deal were temporary, and in May 1939, unemployment in America was still over [20%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304024604575173632046893848).
1.7.2. Con: World War 2 \(not the New Deal\) ended the depression.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Massive war spending was what solved the unemployment crisis and [doubled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal#World_War_II_and_full_employment) the gross national product.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: The [unemployment rate](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/great-depression-great-recession/), which had previously stood at 25%, fell to 1.2% in 1944 due to industry development driven by WWII.
1.7.3. Pro: The [Emergency Banking Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Banking_Act) in 1933 helped stabilize the banking system and laid the groundwork for rebuilding the economy.
1.7.4. Pro: The [Workers Progress Administration](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Works-Progress-Administration) built 650,000 miles \(1,046,000 km\) of roads; 125,000 public buildings; 75,000 bridges; 8,000 parks; and 800 airports, helping to modernize America's infrastructure.
