Discussion Title: Breastfeeding should be mandatory

1. Breastfeeding should be mandatory
1.1. Pro: Breastfeeding is healthier for the child than alternatives.
1.1.1. Pro: The child's illnesses are passed to the mother through the skin - the mother's immune system [develops antibodies to those illnesses and passes them back to the baby](https://www.thestranger.com/features/feature/2015/08/26/22755273/the-more-i-learn-about-breast-milk-the-more-amazed-i-am) in the milk. Formula cannot do this.
1.1.2. Pro: Breast milk is [easier for the baby to digest](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/nursing-basics) than instant formula.
1.1.3. Pro: [Breastfeeding](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/nursing-basics) lowers your baby's risk of having asthma or allergies. Plus, babies who are breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months, without any formula, have fewer ear infections, respiratory illnesses, and bouts of diarrhea. They also have fewer hospitalizations and trips to the doctor.
1.1.4. Pro: Breastfeeding comes with increased Skin-to-skin contact, [which has proven medical benefits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187837).
1.1.5. Pro: Breastfeeding [decreases the babies chance of diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding#Diabetes).
1.1.6. Pro: Breastmilk contains the mothers antibodies, which makes the child immune to many diseases.
1.1.6.1. Con: Enough antibodies are also passed [during the last three months of pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/939.aspx?CategoryID=54).
1.1.6.1.1. Con: This Immunity is [only temporary](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/childrens-health/how-long-do-babies-carry-their-mothers-immunity/) and starts to decrease after the first few weeks or months.
1.1.6.2. Pro: The colostrum \(thick, yellowish milk produced for the first two days\) is especially important and beneficial.
1.1.7. Con: The benefits of breastfeeding, especially in developed countries, are somewhat overstated. The highest quality studies available show [fairly minimal impact](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everybody-calm-down-about-breastfeeding/).
1.1.7.1. Con: While the PROBIT study referenced does have a large sample size \([16491](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11242425) for the whole year of the study\), it wasn't comparing breastfeeders to non-breastfeeders. It studied the effects of encouraging breastfeeding, and the group that was encouraged was only 8.3% more likely to be breastfeeding at the 12 month mark, compared to the control group. Comparing one group to another group with only an 8.3% difference in breastfeeding rates may not be enough to draw strong conclusions.
1.1.7.2. Pro: The PROBIT study referenced found [no evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18310164) of improvements to child behaviour or maternal adjustment at age 12 months.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Quantifying behaviour by questionnaire at 12 months old may be too early/imprecise to detect any trends in behaviour.
1.1.7.3. Pro: The PROBIT study referenced found no reduction in measures of [allergy and asthma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855282), [adiposity, stature, blood pressure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18065591), and [tooth decay](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17878730) at age 6.5 years.
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: For allergy and asthma, after exclusion of six sites \(three experimental and three control\) with suspiciously high rates of positive skin prick tests, risks were significantly increased in the experimental group for four of the five antigens.
1.2. Con: [Public breastfeeding is inappropriate](http://www.debate.org/opinions/is-public-breastfeeding-appropriate).
1.2.1. Pro: Mandatory breastfeeding will increase public breastfeeding.
1.2.2. Pro: Breasts should not be exposed in public as they are a sexual organ.
1.2.2.1. Con: Breasts are [secondary sexual characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sex_characteristic) \(like hair, height, body shape, voice...\) but not a [sex organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ) since they are not involved in human reproduction.
1.2.2.2. Con: Breasts' main function is to feed a child. The fact that they are sexualized does not make them a sex organ, any more than the mouth or the legs are.
1.2.3. Con: Breastfeeding is not a sexual act and shouldn't be treated as if it were.
1.3. Pro: Mandatory breastfeeding will lead to improved services and support for all mothers.
1.3.1. Pro: The 2005 infant feeding survey found [lack of support](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-10851615) was a main reason why mums stopped breastfeeding.
1.3.2. Pro: Mandatory breastfeeding will have huge consequenses in economy, law, politics, contraception, healthcare, socially, cultural, etc. The effects would be positive in the long run, but ask for revolutionary changes.
1.3.3. Con: It could also lead to more mothers not being able to conciliate family and career if that support is not properly legislated and carried out.
1.4. Con: Mothers should breastfeed, but making it mandatory is not the best way to encourage it.
1.4.1. Pro: Breastfeeding should not be made mandatory, but should be supported by every piece of public policy. It is impossible to even consider such a claim until adequate entitlements are in place, for example, fully paid maternity leave of sufficient length to allow for a realistic possibility of a mother both working and continuing to nurse.
1.4.2. Con: Breastfeeding is already globally encouraged, but levels are still very low.
1.4.2.1. Pro: [Not a single country in the world](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/528449001&ved=2ahUKEwj_ytCaqdvbAhVBYsAKHU6yCsIQFjAGegQIBRAB&usg=AOvVaw3VZ1BaDPU9yxC7diVLaKMx&ampcf=1) meets WHO or UNICEF standards.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Only about [two fifths of infants 0-5 months of age](https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/infant-and-young-child-feeding/) worldwide are exclusively breastfed.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Globally, only [45 per cent](https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/infant-and-young-child-feeding/#) of newborns are put to the breast within the first hour of birth, which is considered [extremely important](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/78485.php).
1.4.2.4. Con: Maybe it should be encouraged with tangible political actions that support breadfeeding mothers.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: No country, rich or poor, does enough to help mothers breastfeed their babies for the recommended minimum of six months, according to a UN backed [study](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-health-breastfeeding-idUSKBN1AH480).
1.4.3. Con: Parents have other [existing legal parental responsibilities](https://www.gov.uk/parental-rights-responsibilities) which are mandatory things they must do for their child.
1.4.3.1. Pro: In the UK this includes wellbeing, looking after, and feeding your child.
1.4.3.2. Con: In the UK, no similar requirement for actions which are good for a child are legally required, they are only highly recommended.
1.4.3.3. Pro: [At least 13 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_policy#Policies_and_history_by_country) require parents to vaccinate their children, including USA, France, Germany and Australia.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: The consequences of no [vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html) imply far more harmful results, at the personal and social level, and thus vaccination, unlike breastfeeding, should be mandatory.
1.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: Not breastfeeding does not harm the child.
1.4.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Not vaccinating does not directly harm children either. However, both expose the child to greater risk of illness.
1.4.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It hasn't been proved that a child that does not receive breastfeeding might be exposed to greater risk of illness.
1.4.3.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: 14 EU countries have [at least one mandatory vaccination](https://eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/ese.17.22.20183-en#abstract_content) included in their programme.
1.4.3.4. Con: The existing requirements of parents are describing the overall result - feeding, whereas requiring breastfeeding would be describing a very specific and narrow act.
1.4.3.5. Con: Current legal responsibilities are to ensure parents take basic steps to keep their children alive. Although milk is more nutritious than formula, the benefits are barely more than negligible, despite fervor from some groups about the topic.
1.4.4. Pro: Making it mandatory adds unnessecary costs of regulation, enforcement, and policing.
1.4.4.1. Con: Governments could and should take a very light approach to enforcement, and only bother intervening if a child's health is becoming affected.
1.4.4.2. Con: Instead of spending any time/money on enforcement, a country could make formula free and only available from the health services.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: As the only mothers allowed to bottle feed are those who have a medical reason, they will be at the doctors anyway.
1.4.4.2.2. Con: Many healthy mothers will want to use formula, and will flood the health system asking to get it.
1.4.4.3. Pro: It would be hard, or almost impossible to maintain and enforce such laws, not to mention being a gross intrusion of privacy, integrity and personal choice.
1.4.5. Pro: New York City babies are not given formula unless there's a [medical reason to do so or moms specifically request it](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/02/health/time-bloomberg-breast-feeding/index.html) \(they'll first have to listen to a mandatory speech about why breast is best\).
1.4.6. Pro: Forcing the issue may actually stop some mothers breastfeeding.
1.4.6.1. Pro: [Parents may hide what they are doing or not doing](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/the-conversation-uk/breastfeeding_b_4822843.html) for fear of punishment, rather than seeking out support if there's a problem.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Increased pressure to breastfeed can have [negative effects such as stress and depression](https://www.romper.com/p/the-pressure-to-breastfeed-is-putting-new-moms-at-risk-57969).
1.4.7. Pro: The advantages of mandatory breastfeeding could be attained through education, by merely encouraging it as a preferred default, without making it legally mandatory.
1.5. Con: Women have a right to choose whether to breastfeed.
1.5.1. Pro: It is wrong to legislate how anyone should raise their child.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Provided parents treat their kids well and they are raised to be healthy and happy, the style of parenting should be decided by parents, not the state.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Current systems do not legislate how you should raise your child, instead they legislate that if you fail you may have the child taken by social services.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.5.3. Pro: Parents have the [right to make medical decisions for their children](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.bma.org.uk/-/media/files/pdfs/practical%2520advice%2520at%2520work/ethics/parentalresponsibility.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwik8vOxrdvbAhVLBcAKHdZhCmMQFjAJegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw02DDWuJ2rFim_tVvt0nHlM).
1.5.3.1. Con: Sometimes, [medical professionals can overrule](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/when-parents-disagree-with-doctors-on-a-childs-treatment-who-should-have-the-final-say-64813) the parents.
1.5.4. Pro: No one has the right to insist on what a woman does or does not do with her body.
1.5.4.1. Pro: [Body Autonomy](http://Body Autonomy) is part of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Women should have dominion over their own bodies.
1.6. Pro: Breastfeeding is healthier for the mother than alternatives.
1.6.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.laleche.org.uk/bf-postnatal-depression/) showed that breastfeeding reduces postnatal depression.
1.6.1.1. Con: A [2016 meta study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/) agrees emerging research suggests that a relationship exists, but highlights 1 study which shows [no relationship between breastfeeding and postpartum depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/#B32) and 2 others which showed [breastfeeding mothers have a higher risk of depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842365/#B33).
1.6.2. Pro: Breastfeeding has the advantage of burning some extra calories, which [helps the mother lose the extra weight gained during pregnancy](https://www.wikihow.com/Lose-Weight-While-Breastfeeding).
1.6.2.1. Con: This is not true of all women.
1.6.3. Pro: Breastfeeding [helps prevent cancer in the mother](https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/infant-and-young-child-feeding/).
1.6.4. Con: [Breastfeeding can be painful](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/breast-pain-and-breastfeeding/) for mothers.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Society has no right to demand something that causes pain.
1.6.4.2. Pro: No country has any existing laws which forces people to do painful actions.
1.6.4.3. Con: [Breastfeeding should not hurt](https://www.todaysparent.com/baby/top-10-ways-to-prevent-and-treat-sore-nipples/).  If it does, something is going wrong and the mother should fix the problem or find the medical reason for the pain.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: If there is a medical reason for the pain, this would count as one of the exemptions \[see discussion description\] allowing a mother to use formula instead.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Sometimes a baby might not choose to be painless about breastfeeding \(such as bitting and treating breast feeding like a passifire\). Women should not be required to put up with that.
1.6.5. Con: The government does not legislate one's health. Salad is more healthy than a hamburger, but hamburgers are not illegal.
1.7. Con: Breastfeeding is impractical if mothers return to work.
1.7.1. Con: Pumps can be used to get milk in advance for when the mother is regularly away from the baby.
1.7.1.1. Con: There are [plenty of reasons](https://jezebel.com/5824553/breastfeeding-isnt-all-its-nipple-cracked-up-to-be) why pumping isn't practical for many full time jobs.
1.8. Con: Not all new mothers have the physical ability to breastfeed. Wetnurses would also have to be mandatory.
1.8.1. Con: Even if the mother does not breastfeed there should be a service provided by other women to provide breastmilk just like the olden days.
1.8.2. Con: Exceptions would apply for mothers who cannot breast-feed.
1.8.3. Pro: Many children are not able to properly breastfeed due to physical limitations.
1.8.3.1. Con: Due to the lack of breastfeeding support, many women conclude they cannot breastfeed when in fact with the right support, they can.
1.9. Pro: Breastfeeding is cheaper.
1.9.1. Pro: [Formula costs money](https://community.babycentre.co.uk/post/a25603987/how_much_does_formula_feeding_cost) whereas breastmilk is free.
1.9.1.1. Pro: This saved money can be put to better use for the family.
1.9.1.2. Con: Breastmilk is not free, it is converted from the mothers energy taken from food.
1.9.1.2.1. Pro: The bodies process cannot be 100% efficient, and will produce a relatively small amount of milk from the food she eats.  Formula can be produced more efficiently.
1.9.1.3. Con: Mothers who breastfeed for six months or longer suffer [more severe and more prolonged earnings losses](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122411435477).
1.9.2. Pro: If breastmilk produces health benefits for the child, they will have fewer problems and therefore cost less for the health services.
1.9.3. Con: It may end up being more expensive if the mother has to stop working or reduce working hours.
1.10. Con: In a free society, nothing trivial should be mandatory.
1.10.1. Con: Breastfeeding has proven benefits for the short and long term health of the baby and the mental health of the mother - this is not trivial.
