Discussion Title: Should animals be banned in circuses?

1. Animals should be banned in circuses.
1.1. Con: There is already enough laws preventing animal abuse. If animals are abused in circus those laws should be enough.
1.1.1. Con: Even that the law exist, animal protection agencies don't have enough resources to assure that the law is followed everywhere in a permanent way.
1.1.1.1. Con: People should know when they are breaking the law. Additional laws make it harded and may contradict each other.
1.1.1.2. Con: We should improve funding, not introduce new law. Underfunded agencies will still have problems enforcing the new law as they had with previous laws.
1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.3. Con: It is not a question of animals getting abused in circuses, the problem is that captivity is harmful for animals.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Animals in captivity are at risk of suffering from '[zoochosis](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/zoochosis-what-really-happens-to-animals-in-captivity-video/)', characterized by obsessive, repetitive behaviors like rocking, swaying and pacing.
1.1.4. Con: Animal protection agents usually don't work in a preventive way, when the time to act comes usually the animal has already went through considerable abuse.
1.1.5. Con: We have global basic human rights regulations but no global animal rights regulation.
1.1.6. Con: Even though the laws exist, they have no effect. Animals need more protection.
1.1.6.1. Con: The issue isn't a lack of protections but rather a lack of enforcing the protections that are already in place.
1.2. Pro: Circuses violate animal rights.
1.2.1. Con: Without further details that could be said about people having pet hamsters, dogs in flats, birds, etc.
1.2.2. Con: Animal's rights are violated whenever it's captive. That also means that the rights are violated when it's captive for protective reasons. E.g. Zoos and sanctuaries. Ergo that can't be a reason to ban circuses.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Zoos [violate](https://www.kialo.com/should-zoos-be-banned-2024/2024.0=2024.1+2024.27) animal rights, the same a circuses.
1.2.3. Pro: Animals working for a circus and thus not free, are often prevented from doing most of the things that are natural and important to them, like running, roaming, flying, climbing, hunting, choosing a partner, and being with others of their own kind.
1.2.4. Pro: Animals deserve freedom to live in their natural habitats.
1.2.4.1. Pro: In circuses, animals spend a lot of time in cages and traveling, which is far from their natural rhythm and habitat.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Zoos aren't considered as violating animal right, but they also prevent animals from living in natural habitats.
1.2.5. Pro: Circuses often [mistreat](https://www.peta.org/action/action-alerts/end-cruel-animal-acts-carson-barnes-circus/) and [abuse](https://www.peta.org/features/circus-video-undercover-abuse/) animals.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Performing tricks, wearing uncomfortable [clothes](https://www.peta.org/blog/petas-claws-come-bear-urinates-shrine-circus/) or being kept in really small enclosures are common situations that animals encounter in circuses that are harmful for them.
1.2.5.2. Con: It's the same case in some of the slaughterhouses or some Zoos or private owners. There already are laws in place to prevent abuse and mistreat. No need to target circuses specifically.
1.3. Con: Animals in circuses entertain visitors.
1.3.1. Con: Animals should not be captured and trained merely to serve as human entertainment.
1.3.1.1. Pro: They are living beings, not tools for our pleasure.
1.3.2. Con: The pleasure you get from harming others is not enough to justify the harm.
1.3.3. Pro: In circuses, animals are forced to perform.
1.4. Pro: Animals are trained using "carrot and stick" policy. That equals to animal cruelty.
1.4.1. Con: The methods are not too different from organised dog training, which are not considered animal cruelty.
1.4.1.1. Con: The fact that  such practices may not be considered animal cruelty says nothing about whether it is animal cruelty.
1.4.1.2. Con: That may be a reason to ban such dog training, not to allow circuses using animals.
1.4.1.3. Con: Animals in circus like elephants and lions are wild animals. It's completly different than training a dog or a horse.
1.4.2. Con: These methods can be made illegal without removing animals entirely from circuses.
1.5. Pro: Circuses contribute to unnecessary animal suffering, for the sake of human entertainment.
1.5.1. Pro: Baby animals are often [separated](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/reasons-why-animal-circuses-in-the-u-s-need-to-be-banned/) from their mothers at a young age.
1.6. Con: If the animals are not being harmed in any way there is no legal basis to ban them from circuses, this should be decided on a case to case basis.
1.6.1. Con: Being captive and meant to perform against one's will is harmful to the freedom of the animals.
1.6.2. Con: Experts from reputable organizations, such as the British Veterinary Association, recognize that the welfare of wild animals [can't be ensured](https://www.bva.co.uk/News-campaigns-and-policy/Policy/Ethics-and-welfare/Circuses-and-animals/) in traveling circuses.
1.7. Con: Circuses are not that different from zoos.
1.7.1. Pro: In some zoos there are also animals demanded to perform challenging tasks like in the circus.
1.7.1.1. Con: Not on as big a scale as in circuses. In circuses the point is the performance, in Zoos the point is the showcase of animals "in their natural environment."
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Even when seals and dolphins, for instance, get challenging tasks in the latter, the zoos usually don't push the animals as far as circuses may do.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: [Zoo animal performances](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/25/worlds-leading-zoo-association-overlooked-horrific-cruelty-to-animals) use many of the same acts and tricks, using harsh correction in the same manner as circuses.
1.7.1.2. Con: Zoos should also be [banned](https://www.kialo.com/should-zoos-be-banned-2024/2024.0=2024.1/=2024.1) for using animals for human entertainment.
1.7.2. Con: Most circuses are itinerant unlike most zoos.
1.7.3. Con: That may be a reason to ban zoos, not to allow circuses using animals.
1.7.4. Con: In circuses the animals are kept in cages, while in zoos they are kept in larger places that reproduce their natural habitat.
1.7.5. Con: Unlike zoos, circuses do nothing for habitat conservation.
1.7.6. Con: Circuses are not kept to the same high standards that most zoos are. Circuses rely on entertaining people while many zoos are focused on conservation and education. Zoos also don't move frequently.
1.7.7. Pro: Animals are kept captive in circuses, the same as in zoos.
1.8. Pro: Using animals in circuses, especially wild ones, is unsafe for the spectators as they could become victims of animal attacks.
1.9. Pro: Circuses can continue without using animals \(especially exotic or endangered ones\) by using other acts.
1.9.1. Pro: There are already in existence many [circuses](http://www.bornfreeusa.org/facts.php?more=1&p=419) that are animal-free.
1.10. Pro: Animals in circus \(elephants, lions\) are endangered spieces. We should protect theim in their own habitat and prevent their abuse elsewhere.
1.10.1. Pro: Possibly, the African lion population may [shrink](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/african-lion-populations-could-be-cut-in-half-by-2035/) by 50% until 2035.
1.11. Pro: Accepting cruelty against animals as a form of entertainment is harmful for the society, as it prevents us from evolving to higher levels of morality.
