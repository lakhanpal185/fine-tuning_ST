Discussion Title: Should Vaccines Be Mandatory?

1. Routine childhood vaccination against preventable diseases should be mandatory worldwide.
1.1. Pro: Eradicating certain communicable, vaccine-preventable diseases \(like polio & measles\) worldwide requires that developed countries continue to maintain high rates of vaccination and immunity, even though individuals in those countries are at low risk of exposure to the disease.
1.1.1. Con: Eradication of any diseases is an arbitrary target that hasn't been agreed democratically.
1.1.2. Con: Eradication of other non-contagious diseases such as tetanus cannot be attained via vaccination, since no herd immunity can be attained in this way.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The 'herd immunity' concept only applies to contagious diseases, i.e. not to vaccine-preventable diseases such as [tetanus](http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/herd-immunity).
1.2. Con: Parents forced to vaccinate their children against their will might become less likely to comply with future immunisation or health care interventions \([Bradley, 1999](http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/doi/10.1136/jme.25.4.330)\), which could have an overall negative impact on public health in the longer term.
1.3. Con: It is a breach into individual liberty.
1.3.1. Pro: It is a breach into the liberty of parents to choose the best healthcare for their children.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Substances contained inside vaccines might be seen as unethical by individuals holding certain religious beliefs or ethical positions.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Porcine gelatine \(i.e. gelatine that originates from pigs\) is used as a stabiliser in many vaccines [NHS](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/460069/8584-Vaccines-porcine-gelatine-2015-2P-A4-04-web.pdf), yet certain religions prohibit the consumption of or contact with pig-derived products.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Certain vaccines [contain DNA from aborted fetuses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/wi-38), which might be considered unethical by people holding certain religious beliefs.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: The Catholic Church issued [a statement](https://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=2410) where they accept this fact but still allowing believers to use such vaccines.
1.3.1.2. Con: Parents which do not have sufficient knowledge or expertise in health care are not capable of making an informed decision for their children's healthcare.
1.3.1.3. Con: Belief systems are never sufficiently important to justify risking a child's life or those of other people.
1.3.2. Con: We already ban substances which cause harm to humans \(hard drugs etc..\) which lessens liberty in exchange for societal benefits, as mandatory vaccination would.
1.3.2.1. Con: During alcohol prohibition in the US it became apparent that the ban on alcohol caused more harm than alcohol itself in terms of poor quality control of bootlegged alcohol and gang violence associated with underground distribution networks. [As a result, the constitutional amendment prohibiting alcohol was repealed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeal_of_Prohibition_in_the_United_States) [Similar efforts are underway to eliminate prohibition of marijuana.](http://www.governing.com/gov-data/state-marijuana-laws-map-medical-recreational.html) Using State violence in hopes of achieving societal benefits has a terrible track record.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Recreational marijuana has been legalized in Canada.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Recreational marijuana has been legalized in Mexico.
1.3.2.1.3. Con: Outlawing a product \(such as alcohol\) may predictably result in a black market based on the profit motive of selling that product. It is unlikely that criminal gangs will form for the purpose of skirting vaccination laws.
1.3.2.1.4. Con: The parent resolution says nothing about using violence to enforce the mandate for vaccines.
1.3.2.2. Con: While we do ban harmful substances, in no other case - except for emergency situations - is a medical therapy mandated for the greater good.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: The government can pressure people into treatment, with people that have had drug abuse problems this [seems to be effective](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-abuse-treatment-criminal-justice-populations/legally-mandated-treatment-effective)
1.3.3. Con: Protecting the liberty of individuals who do not want to vaccinate themselves \(or their children\) may conflict with protecting the liberty of other individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons \(e.g. immunodeficiency\) to safely use public spaces such as schools, due to the increased risk to their health.
1.3.3.1. Con: It cannot be easily generalised by how much the health risk for individuals who cannot be vaccinated would increase due to the presence of other voluntarily non-vaccinated people attending the same public spaces. Considering that vaccine-preventable diseases are far from being the most frequent causes of illness in our society, it could be argued that the health risk would only increase marginally.
1.3.3.2. Con: Immune suppressed individuals can be infected by [individuals recently vaccinated for chickenpox \(varicella\), intranasal flu vaccine within one week, rotavirus, or Oral Polio Vaccine](https://www.stjude.org/treatment/patient-resources/caregiver-resources/infection-tips/inpatient-visiting-guidelines.html?vgnextoid=20206f9523e70110VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD). As such, vaccinated children can endanger others. Vaccinated children can still carry diseases even though they do not show symptoms themselves.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Oral polio vaccine has not been routinely administered in the U.S. since 1997, when we [switched](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/polio-vaccine) to the injected\(killed vaccine\) form, which carries zero risk or infection to contacts of the vaccinated person.
1.3.3.3. Con: It is a false equivalence to compare [liberty](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/liberty) to not have foreign matter introduced to your body by force with the liberty to walk about in nature. The latter liberty is not restricted in this case by authority, but by nature itself.
1.3.4. Pro: Pushing a needle into a person without their consent constitutes [assault](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/assault).
1.3.5. Pro: Individual liberty is protected in the case of many other individual choices that pose a greater health risk and cost for society, hence rendering vaccines mandatory is arbitrary and unwarranted.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Similarly, smoking is still allowed, although secondhand or 'passive' smoking poses a high health risk to society [cancer.org](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/tobacco-and-cancer/secondhand-smoke.html)
1.3.5.2. Pro: For instance, it is still allowed to eat meat although farming is one of the leading drivers of climate change [huffingtonpost.com](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/neal-barnard-md/cowsnot-coalare-the-real-_b_5526979.html).
1.4. Pro: If the specific vaccine decreases the risk of death or other serious health impacts for a child whose parents oppose vaccination, compulsory vaccination might be seen as a way to defend the right to healthcare for the child \([Bradley, 1999](https://jme.bmj.com/content/25/4/330)\).
1.4.1. Pro: For instance, a judge in the US ruled in favour of blood transfusion for the child of a family of Jehova's Witnesses against their consent [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/08/judge-rules-jehovahs-witness-boy-blood-transfusion).
1.5. Pro: Compulsory vaccinations would reduce the prevalence of disease.
1.5.1. Con: Hygiene and sanitation caused the decline of disease not vaccines.[jpands.org](https://www.jpands.org/hacienda/article36.html)
1.5.1.1. Con: Cases of [paralytic polio in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/polio/us/) fell from 15,000 annually in 1955 \(when the first vaccine was introduced\) to 10 per year in the 1970s. Prior to that, cases had been on the increase, despite improvements in sanitation and other societal changes. Remaining cases of polio occurred in unvaccinated people. Multivariate analysis does not support any alternative hypothesis, but that the vaccine is effective.
1.5.2. Con: Vaccines do not make the virus extinct. To do that the geographical source of said virus should be located and sanitized fully, which is close to impossible.
1.5.2.1. Con: This is not about complete extermination, but rather a reduction of illness.
1.5.2.2. Con: Disease control by the combined methods of vaccinations and [eradication of the source of the sickness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3373041/) \(killing mosquitoes, draining marshes, eradicating rats etc.\) has proven highly successful in the past
1.5.2.2.1. Con: This is difficult to execute in[poorer countries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2626838/) with un\(der\)developed infrastructure and lack of resources
1.5.2.3. Con: Viruses can become extinct if there is widespread vaccination, AND there is no non-human host or reservoir for the virus. This happened for [smallpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox), and there's the potential for it to happen with [measles](https://measlesrubellainitiative.org/) and [polio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis_eradication) in our lifetimes \(depending on your age now\).
1.5.2.3.1. Con: When there's an animal or other reservoir \(i.e. rabies, which is carried by animals; or the plague, carried by rats; or tetanus, which has spores that can live in soil\) the disease can't be eradicated solely by vaccinating humans.
1.5.3. Pro: Mandatory vaccination is needed in order to maintain herd immunity, protecting those individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
1.5.3.1. Con: High vaccination levels are attained in many countries through information and public engagement campaigns [JSTOR](https://daily.jstor.org/vaccination-compulsory/), [WHO](http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary), and a study commissioned by the EU even found no link between vaccinations being compulsory and vaccination rates [asset-scienceinsociety.eu](http://www.asset-scienceinsociety.eu/reports/page1.html). This suggests that making vaccination mandatory is not strictly needed to achieve herd immunity.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Many elderly people will be able to avoid sickness.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: Elderly people who have adequately vaccinated themselves will not be exposed to any undue risk due to the choice of others preferring not to vaccinate themselves.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Con: Many vaccines are [less effective in the elderly](https://immunityageing.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-4933-4-9), so they may be less effective despite following all the recommendations. Thus they rely on herd immunity from others being vaccinated.
1.5.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.5.3.4. Con: Herd immunity might not be attainable even if vaccines are mandated due to intrinsic levels of vaccine non-response \(i.e. failed immunisation\).
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: An example of vaccine that does not fully protect against the disease is that against flu, which only cuts the risk of hospitalisation by 30-70% elderly people \(not in care homes\) [webmd.com](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/how-effective-is-flu-vaccine#1). This is in part because of the genetic variations in the virus.
1.5.3.4.2. Con: Herd immunity is the[slowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity) or prevention of the spread of disease, due to a prevalence of immunity in a population. It is not an all-or-nothing marker to be "attained." In a population with 30% immunity, the infection in question will spread more slowly that in a population with 0% immunity, other factors being equal. Thus vaccines that give partial immunity can still save lives, on a population basis.
1.5.3.4.3. Pro: Which is exactly why mass immunization is required to improve protection. If you can reduce the number of vectors \(in this case infected people and all the stuff they come in contact with\) then you can reduce the number of infections.
1.6. Pro: In a civilized society the needs of the many should, at times when the impact is greatest, be above the needs of the few or individual. Eradicating or limiting a disease by use of vaccinations is for the greater good of society.
1.6.1. Con: Due to the scarcity of resources, seeking to eradicate any one disease might come at a loss to society. This would be the case if the ratio of benefits to cost for such mandatory immunisation campaign were lower than that for alternative measures that benefit public health \(e.g. providing more resources to accident & emergency departments\).
1.6.1.1. Con: Alternatively, seeking to eradicate one disease may strengthen healthcare infrastructure, as the [Global Polio Eradication Initiative](http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EconomicCase.pdf) \(see p. 2, or text-search for "vitamin A"\) has done in developing countries. The resources poured into eradicating one disease, have resulted in improved access to healthcare for many conditions.
1.7. Pro: Children will become immune to further diseases.
1.8. Con: Scientific studies are shaky on the effectiveness of vaccines.
1.8.1. Con: Efficacy as compared to placebo is the scientific standard for medical effectiveness. The vaccines available at the doctors have been shown to be more effective than placebo in study after study. Therefore, despite the range of efficacy levels, studies are very firm that vaccines are in fact effective.
1.8.2. Pro: Vaccines may become ineffective as a consequence of mishandling of the vaccine between the production and delivery site, for instance due to [failure in the cold chain](http://csafeglobal.com/the-cost-of-a-broken-vaccine-cold-chain-part-one-human-cost/).
1.8.2.1. Con: Studies proving efficacy have established certain protocols for transport, storage and administration of vaccines; the vaccine is only proven to be effective when those procedures are followed. The failure to maintain these protocols should not be an argument against efficacy; it should only reinforce the importance of proper storage etc.
1.8.3. Con: No, they are not. The claim that they are is benched on academic illiteracy: the claim that there are no double blind tests boils down to not meeting the 'ceteris paribus' condition required for any kind of scientific research; however, due to the large n-value this condition is still met when researching the effects over time or between demographic groups.
1.8.4. Con: More than a dozen major infectious diseases \(most notably, smallpox, poliomyelitis, rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, measles, mumps, and rubella\) have been [controlled in many parts of the world by vaccines](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/11/1607/850248).
1.9. Con: Rendering vaccines mandatory does not necessarily represent a cost-effective way of improving public health in all countries.
1.9.1. Pro: It is unclear how many additional lives could be saved through such a policy.
1.9.1.1. Pro: The beneficial impact of a mandatory immunisation campaign depends on country- and region-specific conditions which make it hard or impossible to generally state that vaccines must be made mandatory everywhere.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: Communicable diseases have no respect for international borders. Efforts to control or eradicate these illnesses must be based on worldwide disease burden, i.e. countries with low incidence of disease need to maintain high rates of vaccination until the disease is eradicated/ controlled everywhere.
1.9.1.2. Con: "How many lives could be saved" is clear from comparing incidence of disease in developed vs. underdeveloped countries.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: More complex statistical analysis techniques such as multivariate regression are required to establish the correlation between immunisation rates and incidence of disease. For this it is necessary to correct for differences in the general state of health among different countries and different periods, e.g. accounting for differences in the healthcare system, diet etc.
1.9.1.2.1.1. Con: This statistical analysis would necessarily be based on historical data, and thus would never be entirely applicable to today's population. By this logic no new product should ever be introduced, nor any new treatment recommended.
1.9.1.2.1.1.1. Con: By this argument it would also not be possible to demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccines, since it would be hard to argue that any observed correlation between the incidence in the disease and the immunisation coverage reflects a deeper deterministic link and is not simply spurious.
1.9.1.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.9.1.2.2. Con: Depending on the disease, high incidence of a diseases needs not mean high number of deaths, if a good healthcare service is available.
1.9.1.2.2.1. Con: In countries where there is not good access to health care, it is not only more expedient, but more humane, to provide vaccine and eliminate suffering and death from at least one disease
1.9.2. Con: For some diseases, like [polio](http://polioeradication.org/news-post/a-career-spent-chasing-down-polio/), total eradication is within reach, which would justify the expenditure of public health dollars now, and save money in the future when, as with [smallpox](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/en/), there may be a day when vaccination is no longer needed
1.9.2.1. Pro: The [Global Polio Eradication Initiative](http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/EconomicCase.pdf) \(GPEI\) will cost about ten times as much annually, in the short term, as the "routine" immunizations systems worldwide, but the costs will drop drastically when polio is eradicated. Without an aggressive eradication strategy, the costs of "routine" vaccination, treatment, and death and disability will presumably go on forever.
1.10. Con: There could be negative health impacts for those who are vaccinated.
1.10.1. Pro: Vaccines can cause allergies and asthma.[vactruth.com](https://vactruth.com/2011/07/11/research-shows-vaccinations-are-causing-surge-of-asthma-in-children/)[worldmercuryproject.org](https://worldmercuryproject.org/news/over-vaccinated-children-and-the-allergy-epidemic/)[omicsonline.org](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/evidence-that-food-proteins-in-vaccines-cause-the-development-of-foodallergies-and-its-implications-for-vaccine-policy-2329-6631-1000137.php?aid=60994)[scienceforums.net](https://www.scienceforums.net/topic/78023-direct-evidence-from-the-cdc-that-vaccines-cause-food-allergies/)[naturalnews.com](https://www.naturalnews.com/055537_peanut_allergy_vaccines_toxic_ingredients.html)
1.10.1.1. Con: Major studies have [thoroughly debunked](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccines-and-other-conditions/vaccines-asthma-allergies) this myth.
1.10.1.2. Con: Allergic reactions are so rare it can be easily argued there is [no link](http://www.worldallergy.org/education-and-programs/education/allergic-disease-resource-center/professionals/vaccination-and-the-risk-of-atopy-and-asthma).
1.10.1.3. Con: While there is a very slight risk for children who already have moderate to severe asthma, the risk for the general population is [almost none](http://www.worldallergy.org/education-and-programs/education/allergic-disease-resource-center/professionals/vaccination-and-the-risk-of-atopy-and-asthma).
1.10.2. Pro: A lot of money has been payed due to vaccine injuries.[drugwatch.com](https://www.drugwatch.com/vaccines/injury-compensation/)
1.10.3. Pro: Vaccines can cause cancer.[thetruthaboutcancer.com](https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/vaccine-cancer-connection/)
1.10.3.1. Con: This is [absolutely untrue](https://vaxopedia.org/2018/04/25/can-vaccines-cause-cancer/); there are [no known cases](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/04/did-the-polio-vaccine-cause-cancer/) of vaccines causing cancer.
1.10.3.2. Con: Even in the main case of concern \(polio vaccine\) where the vaccine showed a link with cancer for rodents, this was not replicated in humans; the polio vaccine [does not cause cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15889993) in humans.
1.10.4. Pro: Vaccines can lead to SIDS.[ecf.cofc.uscourts.gov](https://ecf.cofc.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2013vv0611-73-0)
1.10.4.1. Con: This is simply [not true](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/sids.html).
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: The World Health Organisation has categorically confirmed that [this is untrue](http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/detection/immunization_misconceptions/en/index4.html) - a spurious causal link was drawn and has been debunked.
1.10.4.2. Con: One case does not make it a substantive risk.
1.10.5. Pro: Vaccine shedding is a real concern.[medscienceresearch.com](http://medscienceresearch.com/shedding/)[merck.com](https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/v/varivax/varivax_pi.pdf)[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X01004959)[sciencedaily.com](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150624071018.htm)[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096786/)[westonaprice.org](https://www.westonaprice.org/studies-show-that-vaccinated-individuals-spread-disease/)
1.10.5.1. Con: It is only a concern for those with [severely weakened](http://www.thevaccinemom.com/2015/02/vaccine-shedding-should-you-really-be-concerned/) immune systems.
1.10.5.2. Con: Most vaccines [do not shed](http://www.thevaccinemom.com/2015/02/vaccine-shedding-should-you-really-be-concerned/).
1.10.5.3. Con: There is [almost no](http://www.immunizeusa.org/blog/2016/september/24/vaccine-shedding/) record of any substantial harm done to others \(11 in 50 million for chickenpox, for example\).
1.10.5.4. Con: Vaccine shedding is much higher with wild-type infection than with vaccinated individuals, AND the [wild-type pathogens are more likely to cause disease](https://www.nvic.org/cmstemplates/nvic/pdf/live-virus-vaccines-and-vaccine-shedding.pdf) that the attenuated vaccine-type strains.
1.10.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.10.5.6. Con: Shedding of attenuated \(weakened\) virus may be [beneficial](http://www.immunizeusa.org/blog/2016/september/24/vaccine-shedding/), by passively immunizing the imunocompetent contacts of the vaccinated child. This is important in third-world countries, where the likelihood of wild-type disease in immunocompetent contacts is much higher than the likelihood of vaccine-type disease in immunosuppressed contacts.
1.10.5.7. Pro: The circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus \(cVDPV\), which causes health impacts similar to those of the polio virus itself [nejm.org](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0910074), has been the cause of multiple outbreaks in the past [PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3489392/), and as recently as 2017 in Syria [polioeradication.org](http://polioeradication.org/news-post/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-type-2-confirmed-in-syria/).
1.10.5.7.1. Con: Vaccination schedules in several countries have replaced the use of oral vaccines \(i.e. OPV, which could cause cVDPV\) with safer ones \(IPV\), a trend that is considered positive by some \([Shazad, 2009](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/49/8/1287/429938)\).
1.10.5.7.2. Pro: The circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus has been responsible for more cases of paralysis than the wild poliovirus in recent years [polioeradication.org](http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/), [merckmanuals.com](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/enteroviruses/poliomyelitis).
1.10.5.7.2.1. Con: This does not account for the fact that many more cases of polio have been avoided thanks to the vaccine itself [verywellfamily.com](https://www.verywellfamily.com/polio-and-polio-vaccines-2634430).
1.10.5.7.3. Pro: 1 in 2.7 million cases of oral vaccination against polio \(i.e. with OPV\) results in paralysis [verywellfamily.com](https://www.verywellfamily.com/polio-and-polio-vaccines-2634430).
1.10.6. Pro: There is a possibility of vaccines containing substances harmful to humans.
1.10.6.1. Con: All things are harmful to humans, at the wrong dose or delivered incorrectly. Even water is toxic at high enough levels.
1.10.6.2. Pro: The most common adjuvant used in vaccines \(i.e. Aluminium oxyhydroxide, Alhydrogel®\) might be neurotoxic even \(if not especially\) at low doses \([Crépeaux et al, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X16303043)\)
1.10.6.2.1. Con: The link is to a study in mice, which tested effect of aluminum on cognitive function in the short term and found adverse effects from a dose of aluminum which, in humans, would be proportional to 10 to 15 times as much aluminum as contained in one dose of most vaccines.
1.10.6.2.1.1. Con: The link also notes that lower doses might increase the risk due to the mechanism leading to the substance's neurotoxicity.
1.10.6.2.2. Con: The [amount of aluminium](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum) in most vaccines is far less than the amount ingested daily from food, water and other products.
1.10.6.3. Pro: There are proven countereffects of vaccines. They can be found in the warning label.
1.10.6.3.1. Con: Side effects are carefully evaluated by the FDA through intense clinical trials.  The process of getting vaccines to market takes years and is often unsuccessful because the standards are so high.
1.10.6.3.2. Con: Some minor countereffects are nothing compared to billions of lives saved by vaccines. It's normal that, in a huge quantity of the same product, some samples are wrong.
1.10.6.4. Con: The illnesses being prevented by vaccines, are much more harmful than the ingredients in the vaccines themselves.
1.10.7. Pro: Since [vaccines can cause harmful side-effects](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm) mandating their use prevents healthcare professionals from weighing the pros and cons of vaccination based on the needs of individual patients.
1.10.7.1. Pro: [Vaccines are proven to cause adverse symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/should-not-vacc.html) for some users.
1.10.7.2. Pro: Some vaccines have caused autism.
1.10.7.2.1. Con: There is no known mechanism by which vaccines would have caused autism.
1.10.7.2.2. Con: There is a scientific consensus that vaccines do not cause [autism](http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4026.pdf).
1.10.7.2.3. Con: Autism is not a sufficiently serious consequence when compared to the life-threatening illnesses vaccines prevent.
1.10.7.2.4. Con: There is no credible link between vaccines and autism.
1.10.7.2.4.1. Pro: The fear that vaccines increase risk of autism originated in a study by Andrew Wakefield, a British surgeon. The paper has since been [completely discredited](https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/vaccine-myths-debunked/) due to serious procedural errors, undisclosed financial conflicts of interest, and ethical violations.
1.11. Con: Mandatory vaccinations open us \(completely\) up to the potential corruption of pharmaceutical companies.
1.11.1. Pro: Past cases of corruption from 'Big Pharma' companies bribery \[[1](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-29274822)\] \[[2](http://www.transparency.org.uk/publications/corruption-in-the-pharmaceutical-sector/)\] remind us that the risk that this will happen again can never be fully avoided.
1.11.2. Con: All public vaccinations have to be approved by an independent committee regulated by law. This reduces the risk of corruption from pharmaceutical companies.
1.11.2.1. Con: Unless the committee itself has conflicts of interest or becomes simply corrupt.
1.11.3. Con: Whatever the side effects and business interests - a drug that keeps diseases like measles or smallpox extinct is worth all risks.
1.11.4. Pro: Pharmaceutical companies thrive when people are sick. This creates a strong ethical conflict, which needs to be addressed.
1.11.4.1. Con: There's a famous example which solves your doubt: car manufacturers get money from seat belts, but no one says that we shouldn't use them. Equally, if a pharmaceutical company gets money from vaccines, we shouldn't say that there's an ethical conflict.
1.11.4.1.1. Con: This is not a good analogy, because there is no evidence that car manufacturers make money from people being injured in vehicular accidents.
