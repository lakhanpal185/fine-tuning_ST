Discussion Title: Is enlightened despotism superior to democracy?

1. Enlightened Despotism is superior to Democracy.
1.1. Con: Unless there will be another enlightened despot available to succeed after the current leader, the political system would be subject to conflicts of inheritance.
1.1.1. Con: Authoritarian states with a dominating political party, such as Russia, China, Singapore and Vietnam, have shown that generational transitions are possible without instability.
1.1.2. Pro: There is no means in which the succession is enlightened. In all authoritarian states, the successor is the most powerful of the ruling party, not the most beneficent or enlightened.
1.1.2.1. Con: Not if the ruling powers follow what the previous enlightened despot said. They can select a suitable successor and then the ruling party would abide under his wishes.
1.1.3. Pro: After the enlightened despot leaves office or dies, his successor may not share the same values as him. Possibly inciting violence and/or oppression of the people
1.1.4. Con: A truly enlightened despot would select a suitable successor while still in power.
1.2. Pro: An enlightened despot is independent from the negative influences that plague decision-making in democracies.
1.2.1. Pro: A despot is not indebted to any power structure, therefore he is less prone to external pressures which could harm the people.
1.2.1.1. Con: Nobody can rule alone. A despot has to satisfy the people who execute his/her wishes, or he [will be replaced by someone who does](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook).
1.2.1.1.1. Con: The same fear motivates elected leaders, which is why their policies are often shortsighted and only benefit a subset of the population at the expense of the entire country.
1.2.2. Pro: An enlightened despot is immune to corruption from within his own country.
1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.2.2. Con: According to the [Corruption Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017), democratic countries are generally far less corrupt than non-democratic countries.
1.2.3. Pro: Enlightened despots do not need to worry about bureaucracy getting in the way. Societies would then not have to deal with inefficiencies and lack of productivity due to bureaucracy.
1.2.3.1. Con: A despot cannot in any human capability micromanage a large society. Some level of hierarchy and bureaucracy will exist.
1.2.3.2. Con: Inefficiency and bureaucracy create jobs.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Inefficiency and bureaucracy can create jobs only in the short term. Over time, an economy will shrink if there is too much inefficiency and bureaucracy, resulting in fewer jobs.
1.3. Pro: Historical examples of South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore have shown that the [developmental state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_state) under authoritarian rule can grow economically.
1.3.1. Con: Historical example of the present day Russia proves the contrary.
1.3.2. Con: On the other hand, historical examples of late Maoist China, Pol Pol and the Khmer Rouge \(to pair with the suggested South Asia Theme\) are examples of when authoritarian rule had led to mass killings.
1.3.2.1. Con: Mao or Pol Pot have not been what we consider 'enlightened despots' here.
1.3.3. Con: [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee#Legacy), [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror_\(Taiwan\)), and [Singapore](https://www.opendemocracy.net/jim-sleeper/lee-kuan-yew%E2%80%99s-hard-truths) also experienced human rights abuses under authoritarian rule.
1.3.4. Con: This is true, but the reasons why this is the case - efficiency due to a lack of due process, a lack of checks and balances, etc. - are also the reasons why authoritarian regimes are so incredibly dangerous and usually horrible. Democracy is messy, boring, and slow, but that's worth it.
1.3.5. Con: Economic growth has been a defining feature of Asian countries that adopt free market policies. Authoritarians under command economies have resulted in starvation. Therefore it is likely that free markets, not authoritarianism, should get credit for economic growth in Asia.
1.4. Con: Democracy allows the state to take into account the realities of more than one class of people. Whilst the ability to adapt under any form of autocracy will be up to a single person, which is unaware of the realities of a great deal of his subjects. One cannot ask someone who has everything what it is to live in poverty, one cannot ask him to solve a problem he knows nothing about, no matter how wise.
1.4.1. Con: A truly benevolent despot would attempt to know everything about everyone in his country, and attempt to fix the issues plaguing all classes of people.
1.4.1.1. Con: This is a question on the despot's ability to learn, ability which he lacks, not his desire to do learn. He may live with the poor for some time, but he can never learn the stress and the burden of continuous, undesired, poverty.
1.5. Pro: The political career of a benevolent despot is not hindered by corporate interest, allowing them to focus more on the well-being of their people.
1.5.1. Con: In modern history advisors to despots were mainly the business elites and the military since the two safeguard power.
1.5.2. Con: A despot relies on businesses to achieve its economic goals. This makes them dependent.
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.6. Con: Despotism will strain diplomatic relations with democratic countries.
1.6.1. Con: Not according to US relations with multiple other countries. Look at the US and Saudi Arabia, US and South Africa during the apartheid years, and US and Iran pre-coup years with the Shah. They not only got along with these men, but also have stabilized their power.
1.6.2. Con: Democratic states have an incentive to keep autocrats of other nations in power: You only need to pay the autocrat to do as you wish, instead of paying/convincing the entire population of his/her country.
1.6.2.1. Pro: The US [supported](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09CAIRO874_a.html) Hosni Mubarak in Egypt for decades, providing his government with billions of dollars and military equipment.
1.6.3. Pro: Autocracies are [more likely to start wars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook).
1.6.3.1. Pro: An autocratic leader / despot has less to loose if some of his subjects die in war, as his power is not dependent on the people's opinion of him.
1.7. Con: A single individual is vulnerable to accidents and assassination.
1.8. Pro: With an established ruling elite, the people of such a state need not worry about politics and can live their lives with greater freedom.
1.8.1. Con: People in an autocratic state have less freedom because they cannot object if the despot requires them to do something.
1.8.2. Con: The [Human Freedom Index](https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index) shows that democratic countries generally provide much greater freedom to their people than non-democratic countries.
1.9. Con: Despotism is inherently wrong.
1.9.1. Pro: A despot can not be truly enlightened, since a truly enlightened person would be able to tell right from wrong and know that despotism is wrong.
1.9.1.1. Con: There is no objective, universal definition of what it means to be "truly enlightened."
1.9.1.2. Pro: Many famous "[enlightened despots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_enlightened_despots)" have a mixed historical record.
1.9.1.2.1. Pro: The policies of [Louis XVI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVI_of_France) directly led to the French Revolution.
1.9.1.2.2. Pro: [Maria Theresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Theresa#Religious_views_and_policies) was overtly [antisemitic](https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-1744-austrian-queen-expels-the-jews-1.5274976).
1.9.1.2.3. Pro: Napoleon Bonaparte started a number of [wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars) that devastated Europe.
1.9.2. Pro: A despot could not possibly know policies his/her people truly wish for.
1.9.2.1. Con: Modern polling makes it relatively easy even for despots to figure out the will and preferences of the public.
1.9.2.2. Con: Even in non-democratic countries like [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_and_dissent_in_China), [Vietnam](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/vietnam-month-mass-protests), and [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_demonstrations_in_Singapore), public protests can and do occur. This shows the regimes the true wishes of the people, even if they are suppressed.
1.9.3. Pro: An enlightened despot should be viewed like a benevolent slave master. Even if a despot acts in the best interest of people, this impedes on their autonomy and their freedom to act in ways that might not be in their best interest
1.9.4. Con: "Inherently" is just a [semantic stop sign](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FWMfQKG3RpZx6irjm/semantic-stopsigns). There is nothing in the laws of physics that say that despotism is wrong. We decide this, just as we [decided what human rights should be](http://www.ynharari.com/topic/power-and-imagination/).
1.10. Con: Power corrupts. An enlightened despot may quickly become a tyrant.
1.10.1. Con: So can an enlightened democracy. The Tyranny of the uninformed majority is just as bad if not worse than that of a despot.
1.10.2. Pro: An authoritarian leader who became tyrannical would be extremely difficult to remove.
1.11. Pro: Democracy is a deeply flawed system of government.
1.11.1. Con: Democracy empowers the subjects, or at least allows an illusion of it.
1.11.1.1. Con: With gerrymandering and special interest groups in play, it is doubtful that democracy really empowers the people.
1.11.1.2. Pro: Revolt is a legitimate threat to any system of government. When people feel like they have agency over a system, they are less likely to act outside the system to instigate change \(ie through violent political action\).
1.11.2. Pro: Democracy is tyranny of the un-enlightened majority.
1.11.3. Pro: Though democracy represents the will of the people, it is also its downfall, as we see in elections where a charismatic speaker gives speeches of solutions that are unrealistic, but simply because of his/her confidence, people in large amounts vote for them. Most don't think about or look up how damaging the supposed solutions really are. In enlightened despotism, the leader will have groups of experts, who will give reasonable solutions to the problems. That will be carried without hindrances.
1.11.3.1. Con: Experts might be knowledgeable, but they are also subject to corruption and selfishness
1.11.4. Con: Enlightened despotism might be preferable to a flawed democracy, but if you assume an ideal outcome for the one system, you should compare it to the ideal outcome of the other, i.e. an enlightened democracy. An enlightened democracy is preferable.
1.11.4.1. Con: The best version of an enlightened despot would still be more effective than the best version of an enlightened democratically elected leader. No term limits, no election campaigns, no gridlocks in parliament - there would be less possible obstacles that would get in the way.
1.11.4.1.1. Con: If we are talking about an ideal form of democracy, then term limits etc would have no bearing on the effectiveness of the government.
1.11.4.2. Con: But comparing enlightened despotism to enlightened democracy, the former is far easier to accomplish than the latter. You only need one person to be enlightened to achieve enlightened despotism, but you need everyone to be enlightened in an enlightened democracy.
1.11.4.2.1. Con: It can more easily go wrong, too. If your single despot becomes corrupted, your situation is ruined whereas it requires a majority of your democrats to be corrupted to spoil the alternative system.
1.11.5. Pro: Democracy has no mechanism for long-term thinking. An enlightened despot is better able to make decisions beneficial in the long-run than the public in a democracy.
1.11.6. Pro: Democracies waste a lot of time and resources [reversing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/08/24/what-trump-has-undone/?utm_term=.418b9554bd25) [policies](https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/12/22/10-obama-regulations-trump-has-overturned/23315217/#) of previous administrations.
1.12. Con: The virtue of democracy is not its efficiency but rather its legitimacy.
1.12.1. Con: Government exists to serve the people and a government is legitimate insofar as it serves the people well. If a enlightened despotism does this more effectively than a democracy, then it is more legitimate.
1.12.1.1. Con: A despotic government controls the distribution of information and can keep the people unaware of their incompetence.
1.12.1.2. Con: A government that is unaccountable will inevitably become incompetent.
1.12.2. Pro: A comparison between systems must take into consideration the conditions that give rise to each - despotism arises because people fail to take responsibility for their circumstances.
1.12.3. Con: Efficiency and legitimacy are not opposite ends of a spectrum. It is possible to improve one's legitimacy through efficiency and vice versa.
1.12.3.1. Pro: The legitimacy of democracy helps resolving social crisis before they escalate, thus ensuring political stability. This is the foundation of prosperity - and therefore efficient.
1.12.3.2. Con: Legitimacy and efficiency are unrelated. Murdering political dissidents is an efficient way of getting cooperation. Genocide is an efficient way of creating national unity.
1.13. Con: Democracy is superior to ED because there is no effective mechanism for selecting an enlightened despot.
1.13.1. Pro: Even the most enlightened despots became corrupted over time. Frederic the Great created a Judge Court that designed to be independent from the king himself, but the court ended up being fully controlled by the king anyway.
1.13.2. Con: This claim is immaterial, since the question at issue is not whether enlightened despotism could exist, but only whether such a system would be preferable to democracy.
1.13.2.1. Con: Even if you have an enlightened despot right now, you must consider the stability of your country past the lifetime of the current leader. Therefore, you must consider how you would select the next leader.
1.13.3. Pro: As we have seen with the successors of Charlemagne, the roman Emperors that preceded Dictator Cesar or the leaders of the Holy Roman Empire, Dynasties or successors of great individuals tend to be unable to match the vigor of their predecessor. If we manage to have an enlightened Despot, nothing assures the one following him will be as enlightened, and even if he is a perfect match of the previous leader, nothing assures us that the qualities he has is what we will need for the next 50 years.
1.14. Con: To [keep his key cronies loyal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs), the despot has to spend large parts of his resources on them. Thus, there are fewer resources left for the common people.
1.14.1. Con: An enlightened despot would enact anti-corruption laws that would prevent this.
1.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.15. Pro: Since a benevolent despot must not worry about a term limit, he/her may take actions which will harm the nation in the short run but strengthen it in the long run.
1.15.1. Con: Since a despot must not worry about term limit, he need not ask whether his actions will be positive or negative for the nation.
1.15.2. Con: If the despot does not have the trust of the people, he/she may need to use force to impose unpopular measures.
1.15.2.1. Con: The same could be said of democratically elected leaders who lose the trust of their people before the end of their term, as was the case of Ukrainian president [Viktor Yanukovych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych) in 2010.
1.16. Con: A single individual in power is more susceptible to making grave mistakes like mishandling the economy or declaring devastating wars.
1.16.1. Con: An enlightened despot will rely on expert advisors that can take wiser and more rational decisions than a generally uninformed society.
1.16.1.1. Con: A enlightened despot will promote people on a loyalty basis instead of an expertise basis, which is more the rule in an administration implementing democratic decisions.
1.16.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.16.1.3. Con: Experts might be knowledgeable, but they are also subject to corruption and selfishness.
1.16.1.4. Con: A despot is not required to listen to anyone.
1.16.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.16.1.5. Con: This assumes that the despot has total freedom in decision making, which \(s\)he can never have, as \(s\)he relies on the loyalty of other people who execute his/her orders.
1.16.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.16.1.6. Pro: Plato [advocated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_five_regimes) a form of elite, enlightened rule rather than democracy for this reason.
1.16.1.6.1. Con: Plato's ideas were tested by the disciples of his own school on Sicily, with disastrous results. See [Dion of Syracuse.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_of_Syracuse)
1.16.1.6.2. Con: In the very same lines, Plato advocates strong social segregation. Also, while himself doubting to refusing the existence of the Olympic deities, he required death penalty for the common people doing the same, all because considering the religion a pillar of morality worth brutal enforcement. The morality and correctness of Plato's views are thus highly questionable, and may not be counted as doubtless pro for such political arguments.
1.16.2. Con: But, it's given that the leader is enlightened.
