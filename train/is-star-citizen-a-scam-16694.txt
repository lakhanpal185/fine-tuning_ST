Discussion Title: Is Star Citizen a scam?

1. Star Citizen is a scam
1.1. Pro: Many years have passed since Roberts' last SUCCESSFUL involvement in a SUCCESSFUL project. After that we see only failed involvement or failed projects. Or both. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Roberts_\(game_developer\)#Point_of_No_Return_Entertainment/Ascendant_Pictures)
1.2. Pro: Even when consumer-support companies semi-forced them to make a roadmap, they made one only describing early alpha changes \(until at least Q1/19\), no betas, no release.[robertsspaceindustries.com](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/roadmap/board/1-Star-Citizen)
1.3. Con: The company regularly posts [videos and updates](https://www.youtube.com/user/RobertsSpaceInd), so customers are empowered to make informed decisions on whether or not they wish to buy in to the game.
1.4. Con: The tech created by CIG is revolutionary and will raise the bar for video games. That, obviously, takes time and money
1.4.1. Pro: The vision is very complex; this will take a long time to create in modules over the years.
1.4.2. Pro: Yes, people fail to understand how much tech innovations there is in this game vs. other games. Today most studios follow hypes \(Battle Royales, Survivals, etc\). CIG is one of the few really innovatives projects in the industry. If it succeeds, the technologies developed will benefit the whole industry.
1.5. Pro: Chris Roberts has assigned close family members key positions on the company, even though they may not be really qualified to the job.
1.5.1. Pro: His wife \(ex model & actress\) is now VP marketing. Several miscommunications have resulted in heavy criticism of CIG and the project by affluent media players and a significant portion of the gamers community. Although errors in communications are a recurring issue at CIG, she is still in place. That's called nepotism. Which is not a scam as such but a possible constituent of it. Some links supporting the statement: [forums.mmorpg.com](https://forums.mmorpg.com/discussion/436117/chris-roberts-hires-his-brother-and-wife-as-executives) and [imdb.com](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1667407/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm).
1.6. Pro: CIG does not provide full transparancy on the accounting of the project, how much there is left, and how much is needed in order to achieve the declared scope. That prevents backers from properly assessing the risk associated to such ambitious project.
1.7. Con: The company has more than 400 employees working full time.
1.8. Pro: The game was supposed to have launched in 2014.
1.8.1. Con: Many cultural products, from games to movies, need to postpone launching.
1.8.2. Con: The developers of Star Citizen face a [lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Citizen#Legal_issues) for copyright infringements. This delays the launch.
1.8.3. Pro: 7 years and USD 189,603,209.00 later, all they have is a tech demo under heavy development.
1.8.3.1. Con: Not all the money was raised at the inception but over the years.
1.8.3.2. Con: Similar big-budget, open world, stylistically realistic games historically [have cost over $100m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_video_games_to_develop) \(accounting for inflation\). Considering the graphical style and the new tech involved with Star Citizen, a large budget is expected.
1.8.4. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.8.5. Con: Yes but that was before they receive a massive amount of pledges. Seeing the amount of support, CIG has extended the scope & game ambitions have increased, with support of the backers community. It's normal that the game deadlines have changed.
1.9. Con: Chris Roberts has always delivered on his projects, and this time it won't be different.
1.10. Pro: The ship prices are absurd and used to milk the backers.
1.10.1. Pro: A new $27000 package gets you ALMOST all ships but you need to have paid $1000 beforehand.[polygon.com](https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/30/17411226/star-citizen-legatus-pack-bundle)
1.11. Pro: The scope of the project keeps growing so it is never finished, and more money can be raised.
1.11.1. Con: The scope may change to make a better game and not to keep getting money, therefore that is not a sufficient reason to support the scam theory.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
