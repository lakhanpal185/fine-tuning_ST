Discussion Title: Is Narendra Modi good for India?

1. Narendra Modi has been good for India.
1.1. Con: Modi has failed to deliver on his election promises and has thus let down the people who voted for him.
1.1.1. Pro: It is highly likely that the Modi government will not be able to implement its promised educational policies. The committee engaged to prepare the draft of the new policy had been given [three extensions,](http://www.dailypioneer.com/todays-newspaper/modi-govts-national-education-policy-may-not-see-light-during-its-tenure.html) but it is nowhere close to completing its report.
1.1.2. Pro: In 2014, Modi promised to create [10 million](https://qz.com/1269188/the-modi-government-just-cant-figure-out-how-many-jobs-it-has-created/) jobs if elected. He has failed to achieve this, with reports claiming his government has created 3.11 million jobs.
1.1.2.1. Con: During its administration, the Modi government announced that the solution to unemployment is self-employment and through schemes like the Mudra scheme, Stand Up India and Startup India, they claim that they have gotten [9 crores](https://www.indiatoday.in/4-years-of-modi-government/story/after-4-years-here-are-the-promises-modi-govt-could-not-keep-1242120-2018-05-26) \(90 Million\) people self-employment. While this may not be exactly what they initially promised, it is still an achievement on the job front.
1.1.3. Pro: India has 5 GST rates, of the 115 countries with GST regime, 40 countries use a single rate and 28 countries use two rates. Overall the [new tax regime](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/fStxh8vE5vQCW7V1hq1hOK/Simple-rules-for-a-complex-world-GST-classification.html) has brought in enormous complexity as opposed to promised simplicity.
1.1.3.1. Con: Comparing with other countries is not a fair evaluation. India is is more diverse and more populous than any other country in the world.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: It's not clear that cultural diversity should have any impact on the number of tax brackets a nation has.
1.1.4. Pro: Despite Modi's promise to increase the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP, the opposite has happened and it has [declined](https://www.cnbctv18.com/economy/share-of-manufacturing-in-indias-gdp-falling-despite-make-in-india-360521.htm) under his leadership.
1.1.5. Pro: The dollar to INR parity has hit the [lowest ever in history](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/forex/rupee-weakening-on-relapsing-macro-vulnerability-will-it-slow-down-growth/articleshow/65073590.cms). This was a major election point for the current govt.
1.1.6. Pro: Modi also promised that the government would take strict measures to check rising prices and would set up [special courts](https://www.indiatoday.in/4-years-of-modi-government/story/after-4-years-here-are-the-promises-modi-govt-could-not-keep-1242120-2018-05-26) to stop hoarding and black marketing. However, no special courts have been set up so far.
1.1.7. Pro: The government had planned to launch the ['Diamond Quadrilateral' bullet train network project](https://www.indiatoday.in/4-years-of-modi-government/story/after-4-years-here-are-the-promises-modi-govt-could-not-keep-1242120-2018-05-26). However, it has only managed to make a marginal headway on the Ahmedabad-Mumbai stretch.
1.1.8. Con: As promised during his campaign, Modi's government is slowly but steadily removing [archaic and redundant laws](https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/centre-s-clean-up-ct-modi-government-terminates-1-500-archaic-laws-1299212-2018-07-29) to facilitate a smooth functioning of India's Administration.
1.1.9. Pro: Reducing petroleum prices was a major promise in his election campaigns. But after he came to power, petroleum prices in India kept on [increasing](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/rising-petrol-prices-what-narendra-modi-said-before-2014-and-his-govt-did-in-4-years-1202628-2018-04-02) and no efforts were made to reduce the unjustified price hikes.
1.2. Con: Modi is turning India into an Oligarchy. Business men close to the BJP, and Modi in particular have prospered disproportionately with government policies giving them an advantage.
1.2.1. Pro: TRAI changed the definition of market power. Reliance Jio would not qualify under this new definition and can continue to price their services significantly below cost thus avoiding regulatory action on predatory pricing. [TRAI’s new tariff order favours RJio, says COAI](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/trais-new-tariff-order-favours-rjio-says-coai/article22808476.ece).
1.2.1.1. Pro: TRAI reduced IUC \(interconnect usage charges\) rate which gave an undue advantage to Reliance Jio. [Advantage Jio: Trai cuts IUC to 6 paise per minute from October 1](https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/advantage-jio-trai-cuts-iuc-to-6-paise-per-minute-from-october-1-117092000058_1.html)
1.2.1.2. Con: TRAI chairman also suggested that the Telcos could move to the court if they think that TRAI has favored a particular company.[telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/trais-r-s-sharma-says-incumbents-free-to-move-court-on-predatory-pricing-order/63092390)
1.2.2. Con: All developing economies and BRICS nations have been oligarchies. The Ambanis have always been known to be close to the then ruling parties. This is nothing new. Money brings you clout. On the other hand, one of the perceived close conglomerates to Modi is currently [being investigated for an overvaluation charge](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/gautam-adani-dri-authoritys-clean-chit-to-firms-is-illegal-customs-appeal-5060183/). Another, [Vedanta](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/sterlite-protests-vedanta-environment-law-violations-orissa-tuticorin-zambia) continues to be hounded and investigated for mining infractions.
1.2.3. Con: A party with a good rapport with businesses always attracts investors. Modi has been marketing India's strength throughout the world. Example: [Google rolled out worlds biggest public wifi project](https://qz.com/india/1300522/googles-free-wifi-at-railway-stations-is-a-way-of-life-for-8-million-indians/) in Indian railway stations. Google had announced 2015 during Modi’s visit to its HQ in Mountain View, California.
1.2.4. Pro: Rafale deal is a case of crony capitalism, where a Government backed entity should have been involved and would have been involved, BJP introduced an inexperienced [company of ADA](https://thewire.in/business/rafale-reliance-defence-anil-ambani-narendra-modi) to be the offset partner of the deal, and ADA's company gave [1.4million dollars to Hollande's partner](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rafale-controversy-reliance-entertainment-francois-hollande-bjp-narendra-modi-india-france-5376140/). This is more than crony capitalism its now a quid pro quo involving reliance, french president Hollande and Indian PM Mr. Modi.
1.2.4.1. Con: [Dassault Aviation](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rafale-deal-full-statement-by-dassault-aviation-after-francois-hollandes-stunner-1920377), CEO Eric Trappier, had explained in a letter and an interview that Reliance was their choice. This was in response to Ex-french president Hollande's statement.
1.2.4.2. Pro: [Hollande said that Indian Government proposed Anil Ambani's company](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/rafale-deal-french-president-hollande-claims-india-proposed-anil-ambani-reliance/story/282714.html).
1.2.5. Pro: Turnover of a company owned by Jay Shah \(Shah’s son\)[Jay shah Rocks](https://thewire.in/business/amit-shah-narendra-modi-jay-shah-bjp) increased 16,000 times over in the year following election of PM Narendra Modi.
1.3. Pro: Modi has been tough on internal and external security threats.
1.3.1. Con: India ranked third on [number of terror attacks](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/272485.pdf), competing with Iraq and Afghanistan
1.3.2. Con: [Cow vigilantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cow_vigilante_violence_in_India) \(people taking the law into their own hands to protect cows\) has been on rise and the PM is [hesitant to act](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/cow-vigilantes-pm-modi-gujarat-gau-rakshaks-985475-2017-06-29) against these elements.
1.3.2.1. Pro: BJP CM Yogi's [questioning](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-karnataka-cm-is-hindu-let-him-ban-beef-yogi/articleshow/62407920.cms) of why Karnataka's then-CM had not banned beef in his state is an example of the potentially harmful stance that Modi's party has taken, as such pointed statements can embolden cow protection gangs to further their violence.
1.3.3. Pro: Zero tolerance towards Maoists has decreased number of Naxal affected districts by 44. The new list of LWE-hit areas now includes 90 districts, of which [only 58 had seen violence in the past year.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maoist-influence-shrinks-centre-removes-44-districts-from-affected-list/articleshow/63776683.cms)
1.3.4. Pro: The number of kidnappings and hostage-takings by terrorist groups has fallen [by over half since 2015.](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/272485.pdf)
1.3.5. Con: Although BJP had vowed to adopt a [“zero tolerance”](https://www.firstpost.com/india/three-years-of-narendra-modi-govt-terrorism-claimed-more-lives-in-jammu-and-kashmir-under-bjp-rule-3486939.html) policy on terrorism in its election manifesto, terrorism has claimed more lives in Jammu and Kashmir \(J&K\) under BJP rule than the government that preceded it.
1.3.5.1. Pro: J&K has seen a [42% increase](https://www.firstpost.com/india/three-years-of-narendra-modi-govt-terrorism-claimed-more-lives-in-jammu-and-kashmir-under-bjp-rule-3486939.html) in terrorism-related deaths since BJP came to power, compared with the last three years of when the United Progressive Alliance \(UPA\) political party was in power.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Research shows that the number of security personnel killed in terrorist violence has [increased by 72%](https://www.firstpost.com/india/three-years-of-narendra-modi-govt-terrorism-claimed-more-lives-in-jammu-and-kashmir-under-bjp-rule-3486939.html) from 111 in the last three years of when the United Progressive Alliance \(UPA\) political party was in power, to 191 in the BJP’s first three years of rule.
1.3.5.3. Con: The [latest](http://zeenews.india.com/india/nda-vs-upa-more-terrorists-killed-fewer-terror-attacks-in-jk-says-report-2071327.html) ground report states that there have been fewer terror attacks and more terrorists killed. That excludes the counter-insurgency operations and foiled infiltration bids.
1.3.6. Con: There has been sharp [increase in violence](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2015/02/25/amnesty-modi_n_6748946.html) especially in the name of Hindutava under Modi's prime ministership and this is a dangerous trend. The [minorities, dalits, tribals and poor](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/muslims-dalits-religious-attacks-grew-in-india-narendra-modi-us-report-959959-2017-02-10) are feeling as insecure as never before.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Modi has not addressed these internal conflicts adequately. For instance, while he [tweets](https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/742054515696754690) live shunning gun violence in America, he completely ignores lynching of Muslims on the rumour of beef eating.
1.3.6.2. Pro: The Supreme Court has [reprimanded](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-condemns-mob-lynchings-asks-parliament-to-make-law/story-QqEIgLfpmJZZCjeU4XyTMI.html) the centre in not taking enough action to curb violence. Instances such as [alwar](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/alwar-lynching-rajasthan-police-admit-delay-in-taking-victim-to-health-centre-5271312/), [pehlu](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alwar-lynching-pehlu-khan-killed-by-cow-vigilantes-was-no-cattle-smuggler/story-oHFwJT3e8R8kJn396KEGOO.html) amongst many others , are a telling comment to the same.
1.3.7. Con: Rape and women violence has seen shocking instances \([Asifa](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43722714), Bihar victim and so on\). This is almost a deja-vu of the Nirbhaya episode.
1.3.7.1. Pro: After [threatening Deepika Padukone](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/entertainment/padmavati-controversy-karni-sena-threatens-deepika-padukone-another-group-writes-petition-in-blood-2441107.html), right wing extremist group Karni Sena [threatens](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/karni-sena-threatens-to-chop-off-rajasthan-minister-kiran-maheshwaris-nose-and-ears-1867110) a minister in the government. The BJP government has been impotent towards such groups.
1.3.8. Pro: Major defence deals have been cleared.  A big push has been made in India in [defence deals](https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/make-in-india-initiative-defence-ministry-drdo-modi-1099146-2017-12-03) with[focus on removing bottle necks.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/In-first-year-Modi-govt-cleared-defence-proposals-worth-Rs-1L-crore/articleshow/47304111.cms)
1.3.8.1. Pro: Defence Ministry has gotten over the phase of [paralysis](https://www.dailyo.in/politics/indian-army-war-wastage-reserve-ordnance-factory-board-ministry-of-defence-parrikar-ammunition/story/1/4411.html) which was there during the time of AK Antony when [no major](https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-10-major-deals-pending-due-to-defence-minister-ak-antony-s-overcautious-approach-1944488) purchase was made.
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: The UPA government started negotiating in 2012 with Dassault Aviation to buy 126 Aircraft. However, the deal could not be sealed\([ref](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirmala-sitharaman-blames-hal-ak-antony-for-upas-rafale-deal-collapse/article24942902.ece)\).
1.3.8.2. Pro: The war reserves of the country have [improved](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/01/18/exclusive-india-has-just-bought-3-billion-worth-of-emergency-w_a_21657451/).
1.3.8.3. Con: The Rafale deal is suspected to be a [fraudulent](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/things-to-know-about-rafale-deal-that-heated-up-parliament/debate-on-rafale-deal/slideshow/62838997.cms) one.
1.3.9. Pro: Modi [has argued](https://www.deccanherald.com/content/588690/note-ban-destroyed-terrorism-modi.html) that demonetization "destroyed terrorism... human trafficking and the underworld" by depriving criminals of easy sources of cash.
1.3.9.1. Con: Demonetization as a measure against cash has fallen flat as currency with public [reached a record high](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/currency-with-public-now-reaches-a-record-over-rs-18-lakh-crore-higher-than-postdemonetisation-days/story/278915.html) as of Jun 1, 2018.
1.3.9.1.1. Pro: The [cash-to-GDP ratio](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2018/05/03/chart-cash-to-gdp-ratio-approaches-pre-demonetisation-levels) has also reached pre-demonetisation levels.
1.3.9.2. Con: Terrorist attacks and riots have risen in Kashmir since then, with jawans \(soldiers\) and journalists being shot. In fact, the ruling party [claim](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-ideologue-says-plot-to-assassinate-pm-concocted-to-prop-up-modi-s-image/story-uEJ0FBqUZ0KicJz9KS7uDJ.html) that Maoists want to assassinate Modi.
1.3.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.
1.3.9.3. Pro: Demonetization [made it more diffecult](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/demonetization-is-a-net-positive-move/) to operate illegally using cash, so it is less economical to do so.
1.3.9.4. Pro: There [is already](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Demonetization-move-has-halved-Mumbai-crime-rate/articleshow/55643669.cms) evidence that crime rates have fallen, such as a reduction by half in supari \(contract\) killings in Mumbai, when "hot" money isn't available for payments.
1.3.10. Pro: Modi [has threatened](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/china-defends-pakistan-against-modis-terror-export-factory-remark/articleshow/63844609.cms) to use strikes against Pakistan if it did not crack down on terror there, calling Pakistan a "Terror export Factory".
1.3.11. Con: Modi has been deliberately stoking racial and religious tensions.
1.3.11.1. Pro: There is a growing divide between Christians and the ruling government, especially as a Hindu Nationalist [was appointed governor](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/letter-catholic-archbishop-incensed-india-bjp-180529105850511.html) of Christian-majority Mizoram.
1.3.11.2. Pro: It is expected that Modi will use the newly built nationalist [Statue of Unity](https://www.firstpost.com/india/india-spends-430-million-on-statue-of-unity-in-gujarat-narendra-modi-to-inaugurate-182-metre-high-project-on-31-october-5103031.html) to rouse Hindu nationalist support in the next election.
1.3.11.3. Pro: The [right-wing Hindu groups](https://www.dw.com/en/narendra-modis-4-years-in-power-good-or-bad-for-india/a-43974581) which had insignificant influence, prior to Modi's elections, have become extremely powerful. As an unfortunate result, forced conversions of Muslims and Christians to Hinduism have been on the rise.
1.3.11.4. Pro: The BJP initially came to power by creating [hysteria](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/indian-election-narendra-modi-bjp-donald-trump-far-right-a7635086.html) against Muslims for "disrespecting" cows. Since the opposition of Muslims is what gave the party its base, it is unlikely that Modi will ever cease to campaign using Hindu nationalist rhetoric.
1.3.12. Pro: In [response](https://www.economist.com/asia/2016/10/06/reversing-roles?zid=306&ah=1b164dbd43b0cb27ba0d4c3b12a5e227) to a 2016 militant attack on an army base in Uri, India conducted surgical strikes in Pakistan controlled region of Kashmir and killed terrorists it deemed to be targeting the border and major Indian cities.
1.3.12.1. Con: Pakistan's ceasefire violations in Kashmir have been sharply increasing - [Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/home-minister-rajnath-singh-confirms-security-operations-will-resume-in-kashmir-5221656/) . "Pakistan violated the ceasefire 1,252 times till May this year as compared to 971 such violations in 2017, 449 in 2016 and 405 in 2015"
1.3.12.2. Con: The Kashmir issue has arguably risen to one of its ugliest highs with journalists losing their lives along with soldiers. Although India has rejected the UN [report](https://www.firstpost.com/world/unhcr-kashmir-report-calls-for-internaional-inquiry-all-you-need-to-know-about-commissioner-zeid-raad-al-hussein-4514741.html), the report coming out in itself is a blot on the nation's record.
1.4. Con: Modi is morally bankrupt.
1.4.1. Pro: Modi has yet to show [any remorse](https://www.vox.com/cards/narendra-modi/what-was-the-2002-gujarat-violence-that-has-so-marred-modis-image) for the religious clashes that happened in Gujarat under his watch and killed more than 1,000 Muslims.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Narendra Modi should have taken moral responsibility for Gujarat massacre and quit public life long ago, at the very least. The SIT report on the Gujarat riots is marred with controversies. Moreover, the SIT report did not completely exonerate Modi either [\(analysis of the SIT report\)](http://www.democraciaycooperacion.net/IMG/pdf/Tehalka_article.pdf). These does not make a man 'good for India'.
1.4.1.2. Con: The Special Investigation Team formed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India [acquitted](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sit-finds-no-proof-against-modi-says-court/article3300175.ece) Shri Modi Ji of all accusations leveled against him. 

Additional link: [www.dawn.com](https://www.dawn.com/news/709390)
1.4.2. Con: Modi has [a strong work ethic](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/live-blog/pm-modis-work-ethic-5-interesting-facts/listshow/52633169.cms), sleeping only 3-4 hours a night and focusing on accomplishing as much as possible per day.
1.4.2.1. Con: Consistently getting less than the [recommended amount](https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html) of sleep has been shown to [negatively affect](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/little-sleep-much-affect-memory-201405027136) one's mental faculties, therefore Modi's "strong work ethic" is actually irresponsible since the decisions that he makes affect millions of people.
1.4.2.2. Con: This is purely hearsay and a PR think there is no actual "work chart" that is known to exist in public for the same. Also, this is job so if it requires overtime then be it. It doesn't reflect work ethics but poor management of time causing more work hours.
1.4.3. Pro: [Politicising Indian Armed Forces](https://www.thequint.com/voices/opinion/opinion-politicising-indian-army-could-ruin-its-internal-fabric) for personal and political gains.
1.4.3.1. Pro: A covert operation like surgical strikes have been politicised and now a special day is being planned for the same to make in into a legacy. [Using Indian Army for political mileage is just not right.](https://www.dailypioneer.com/2018/state-editions/stop-politicising-indian-army-over-surgical-strikes-capt-to-centre.html)
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Cross-border operations happed under [previous governments too](https://www.newsnation.in/india-news/from-1971-to-2016-history-of-surgical-strikes-in-india-anniversary-of-surgical-strike-on-pakistan-uri-attack-article-183212.html). This is only government that has tried to politicise it and use it for electoral gain.
1.4.4. Con: While people were leaving after his speech, PM Modi cared to go to old member of Azad Hind Fauj and [help him](https://youtu.be/dwRJN0eE-0o?t=2605). This shows his humility and caring for old.
1.4.5. Pro: Modi invest lot of money on his [dress](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/rs-1-lakh-a-day-for-narendra-modis-beautician-178064-2014-01-23), shoes and [foreign trips](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Prime-Minister-Narendra-Modi-his-mantris-spent-Rs-567cr-on-foreign-trips-in-2015-16/articleshow/51486086.cms).
1.4.5.1. Con: Appearing sharp is necessary when he is the prime minister. He represents India wherever he goes.
1.4.5.2. Con: Most people invest a lot of time and money in their appearance, especially when they're a public figure and are thus judged heavily by how they look.
1.4.5.3. Con: Caring about their appearance does not mean that someone's a bad person; there are many other traits and attributes that are far more important than that.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: Modi could invest the money he chooses to spend on his appearance in more ethical pursuits, such as donating it to charity. There is a direct opportunity cost when he chooses to spend money on his appearance.
1.4.6. Pro: Modi follows an [army of trolls](https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-twitter-trolls-free-expression) in twitter who routinely issue rape threats, death threats and indulge in communal incitement.
1.4.6.1. Con: Following anyone on Twitter does not have any morality associated with it. PM Modi cannot be indicted for the social media posts made by someone else.
1.4.6.2. Con: Following trolls doesn't necessarily mean that he supports them; Modi could simply be keeping an eye on people whom he considers to be potential troublemakers.
1.4.6.2.1. Pro: Many politicians follow people they don’t necessarily agree with, such as political rivals, so that they can engage with what those people tweet, rather than to endorse them.
1.4.6.2.2. Con: Thats not at all true. He recently and likewise on many previous occasions invited some [of these trolls.](https://www.thequint.com/technology/2015/07/06/twitter-trolls-among-super150-invited-by-pm-modi)
1.4.6.2.3. Con: As the PM of India, Modi would be unlikely to take care of such a task himself. Instead, it'd likely be handled by dedicated staff and maybe even intelligence agencies, who can systematically monitor and follow up on serious threats.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Recently, the [foreign affairs minister](https://twitter.com/sushmaswaraj/status/1010835030896070656?s=12) was attacked on Twitter by such trolls who know no boundaries - [\(Islamic Kidney ....\)](https://scroll.in/article/884226/the-social-media-assault-on-sushma-swaraj-is-not-mere-trolling-it-is-moral-collapse) By following trolls, the PM has made the actions of such trolls acceptable.
1.4.7. Pro: Modi has failed to effectively condemn attacks against [women](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/opinion/narendra-modi-women-rape-attack.html) in India, including those in which supporters and members of his party are implicated.
1.4.7.1. Con: There's a plethora of wrongs in the country. As Prime Minister, he cannot focus on correcting everything at once. He focused on ending open defecation, gender equality, swatch bharat abhiyan, etc. These are big cultural changes in the country.
1.4.7.2. Con: It is improper for a democratically elected official to comment on criminal cases that have not progressed through due process of law to a conviction. Modi is correct in not commenting on these cases.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: There is a difference between neglecting to comment on individual criminal cases versus neglecting to comment on a nationwide rape epidemic, which is reflective of a larger cultural problem that needs to be addressed.
1.4.7.3. Con: Modi has in fact made [public statements](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-politicise-rape-pm-modi-in-uk/articleshow/63822484.cms) condemning rape in which he has pointed out that it is a [societal problem](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/19/asia/modi-rape-politicized-india-intl/index.html) that needs to be addressed and that society needs to stop victim-blaming women and start questioning the actions of men.
1.4.7.3.1. Con: [This video shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjFSKgGXQtI) his inconsistent stand on the issue. Prior to forming the government, he leaves no opportunity to take potshots at the opposition on women crimes. The video also shows that during his reign, within a matter of 15 days he has switched from calling it a “societal” issue to “a congress state” issue. It demonstrates that he is not serious in tackling it seriously but extracting mileage out of it depending on the crowd he addresses
1.5. Con: By spreading false information on social media and offline platforms, the Modi government is purposefully keeping the Indian public ill-informed.
1.5.1. Pro: The Modi government posted false statistics on [petrol](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1039110521549512707) and [diesel](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1039110636326637568) prices. It doesn’t take a genius to see how flawed the tweet is.
1.5.1.1. Con: Fuel price graph statistics : They just wanted to show that the [% increase in fuel prices](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1039110521549512707) was lesser compared to previous term. Anyone with basic school education can understand that. Value of percentage was shown in graph. But yes, there was fuel price value \(not %\) also on the graph which made it easy for everyone to troll.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: The purpose of a bar graph is that the bigger bar represents the bigger value. While the graph does explain what it means, anyone just seeing the graph would think that it meant fuel prices were lower under Modi - which is the opposite of truth.
1.5.1.2. Con: The Modi government has since [acknowledged the increase in fuel prices](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/fuel-prices-bjp-chief-amit-shah-says-government-to-come-out-with-a-stand/articleshow/65821979.cms) and promised to take a stand on the issue.
1.5.2. Pro: The BJP keeps claiming that [Aadhaar is completely secure](https://twitter.com/BJP4India/status/1025685571031642112) when it has been [hacked](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2018/09/11/uidai-s-aadhaar-software-hacked-id-database-compromised-experts-confirm_a_23522472/) [multiple](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/data-breach-french-hacker-exposes-flaws-aadhaar-deadline-android-app-do-not-to-use-it/story/272626.html) [times](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/aadhaar-details-sold-for-rs-500-uidai-data-breach/story/267314.html). Even when the [TRAI's chief posted a challenge](https://twitter.com/rssharma3/status/1023119411568201730) and [lost](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/personal-details-of-trai-chief-rs-sharma-leaked-after-open-challenge-on-twitter-4844361.html) he remained in denial. They have been throwing money to secure an already compromised system rather than withdrawing it to prevent further damage.
1.5.3. Pro: He has popularized pseudoscience in the [garb](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/28/indian-prime-minister-genetic-science-existed-ancient-times) of spirituality and religion.
1.5.3.1. Con: Modi's claim is far from mixing of science and religion, as it has been acknowledged by medical professionals and institutions abroad. It is being [upheld and celebrated](http://hinducouncil.com.au/new/maharishi-sushruta-a-surgeon-famous-in-melbourne/) in Australia although sadly in India, India's claim to ancient wisdom is resisted by pseudoseculars.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Modi's claim links mythology to modern science. Yes, ancient wisdom/Indian history has seen scholars like Sushruta who also insisted on science and not on mythology to further their discoveries. By correlating mythology and ancient wisdom, it is a toxic path that Modi is taking.
1.5.4. Pro: Modi has been accused of repeatedly using [false news and twisted facts to defame his opponents](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/modi-second-to-none-in-fake-news-by-mani-shankar-aiyar-1833113). In most cases, he has also failed to provide evidence for his claims. It is hence not just immoral for him to lie to the Indian people, but it is also a way for him to unfairly influence the democratic process.
1.5.5. Pro: Union minister under the Modi govt. claimed that [Darwinism](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/darwin-theory-wrong-no-one-has-seen-ape-turning-into-man-says-mos-satyapal-singh/article22481927.ece) is wrong.
1.5.6. Pro: Even mainstream media has been reporting that there is a [BJP fake news factory](https://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/bjp-lying-factory-back-to-spinning-fake-news-about-congress-rahul-gandhi-118032300350_1.html). There have been [more instances](https://www.altnews.in/fake-news-round-november-2017-bjp-cell-head-amit-malviya-star/) and total collection of the same is still being compiled.
1.6. Pro: Modi is better for India than the alternatives.
1.6.1. Pro: [Modi has proved himself in Gujarat](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2015/01/08/the-gujarat-model). Rahul has not proved as a CM for any other state. If he proves himself as CM for a state and proves he can build a state, we can trust this country to him. Otherwise, what is his eligibility to be PM? [We would be doing a big mistake again by handing over India](https://www.economist.com/banyan/2012/09/10/the-rahul-problem) to Rahul Gandhi & family. Earn the position, and not by spoon feeding.
1.6.2. Pro: Modi has prior administrative experience, whereas Rahul Gandhi can't even participate in a parliament debate seriously. [firstpost.com](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/rahul-gandhis-hug-to-modi-a-political-statement-not-an-expression-of-love-the-wink-gave-his-game-away-4785031.html)
1.7. Pro: Modi supports use of technology for the benefit of nation.
1.7.1. Pro: He used Aadhar and cancelled 3 crore fake, duplicate ration cards [saving 17000 crore](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/aadhaar-helped-cancel-3-crore-fake-duplicate-ration-cards-minister/articleshow/63082030.cms).
1.7.2. Pro: [3 Lakh Fake directors were disqualified](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html) by performing full KYC of all company directors of companies.
1.7.3. Pro: PM Modi is working to increase [Usage Of AI and Blockchain In Agriculture](https://inc42.com/buzz/pm-modi-pitches-for-usage-of-ai-and-blockchain-in-agriculture/).
1.7.4. Pro: [Modi meets tech company CEOs and owners to bring investments to India](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/NVUME6qX5Oz3WmlA3uqu9O/Narendra-Modi-meets-with-tech-titans-in-Silicon-Valley.html) in his foreign visits.
1.7.5. Pro: He used All India Radio, NaMo app, twitter and all the [latest ways to stay connected with citizens](https://www.firstpost.com/india/namo-app-survey-narendra-modi-seeks-accountability-commitment-from-bjp-leaders-takes-communication-strategy-to-next-level-4485009.html).
1.7.6. Con: Demonetization was a big failure which [closed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/krnkashyap/2016/12/15/how-indias-demonetization-is-affecting-its-startups/#9cb4799f2c2d) many start up across the country. This has downgraded the vibrant start up environment in India and was a huge set back. This was furthered by negative growth rate and rupee fall.
1.8. Pro: Modi is widely honored by multiple countries and recognized as one of the most powerful global personality
1.8.1. Pro: Narendra Modi among [top 10 most powerful people](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/narendra-modi-among-top-10-most-powerful-people-in-the-world-forbes/articleshow/64094380.cms) in the world : Forbes 2018
1.8.2. Pro: PM Modi conferred [Saudi’s highest civilian honour](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/modi-saudi-arabia-king-abdulaziz-sash-civilian-honour/)
1.8.3. Pro: [Modi receives champion of earth award](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/et-explains/what-is-champions-of-the-earth-award-and-why-has-narendra-modi-won-it/articleshow/66052143.cms)
1.8.4. Pro: Gallup international survey took Opinion of Global Leaders across 50 nations and found [PM Narendra Modi at no. 3 ahead of Trump, Xi Jinping & Putin](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/gallup-international-survey-pm-narendra-modi-at-no-3-ahead-of-trump-xi-jinping-putin/articleshow/62467725.cms)
1.8.5. Pro: Modi conferred [‘Grand Collar of the State of Palestine’ In recognition of his wise leadership and his lofty national and international stature](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-conferred-grand-collar-of-the-state-of-palestine/article22714293.ece)
1.8.6. Pro: [PM was awarded the Amir Amanullah Khan Award, Afghanistan's highest civilian honour](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/neighbours/040616/narendra-modi-awarded-afghanistan-s-top-civilian-honour.html)
1.8.7. Pro: [Selected as 5th most powerful leader in 2015](http://fortune.com/worlds-greatest-leaders/2015/narendra-modi-5/) by Forbes magazine
1.8.8. Pro: [Prime Minister Narendra Modi awarded Seoul Peace Prize for 'Modinomics'](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/prime-minister-modi-awarded-the-seoul-peace-prize-for-2018/story/286285.html)
1.9. Pro: Under Modi's leadership, the Indian economy has flourished.
1.9.1. Pro: Modi has launched "[Make in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_in_India)", a policy aimed at attracting more manufacturing and other investments.
1.9.1.1. Con: Wages in India's manufacturing sector are way [too low](https://qz.com/1064592/the-glaring-problem-keeping-make-in-india-from-attaining-the-success-of-made-in-china/) to attract the well-trained talent needed to make "Make in India" a success.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: Additionally, the unwillingness of companies to offer competitive wage raises and promotions to their employees has led an increase in ["job-hopping"](https://www.enworld.co.in/blog/2017/02/is-job-hopping-a-problem) across India. This means that even if companies can initially attract well-trained talent, they will have a difficult time keeping it.
1.9.1.2. Con: Instead of actually strengthening manufacturing, Modi's government relies on [protectionist policies](https://qz.com/1200950/modi-risks-undoing-a-generation-of-economic-reforms-in-india-says-economist-arvind-panagariya/) such as higher tariffs. This will only raise prices for Indian consumers and hurt the economy in the long run.
1.9.1.3. Pro: This is a much-needed policy that could help India tap its almost unrivalled labour resources.
1.9.1.3.1. Con: India was ranked [103](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-human-capital-index-india-ranks-103-also-among-lowest-in-the-world-in-employment-gender-gap/story-aXsXGaNjtGmxG6Z90JaNcJ.html) on the World Economic Forum's Global Human Capital Index.
1.9.1.3.2. Pro: India is [expected](https://populyst.net/2015/09/25/working-age-population-around-the-world-1960-2050/) to have the largest working age population in the world by 2050.
1.9.1.4. Pro: As of May 2017, the initiative started to yield results: The number of industrial projects set up in India, foreign direct investments and merchandise exports had [all begun to rise](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/xaNsPPwllWVOR9k3MJBQKJ/Is-Make-in-India-beginning-to-bear-fruit.html).
1.9.1.4.1. Pro: Foreign Direct Investment to India’s manufacturing sector [grew by 82%](http://www.thehindu.com/business/jobs-impact-of-make-in-india-under-review/article17616497.ece) during April and November 2016.
1.9.1.4.2. Con: Statistics finding that FDI has risen may falsely include [round-tripping investments](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/experts-question-success-of-make-in-india-campaign/articleshow/56559087.cms), i.e. money that has left India for another country \(often a tax haven\) and then come back as "foreign" investment.
1.9.1.4.3. Pro: Make In India has also secured a boost in the defense sector where major defense aircrafts are to [be manufactured in India](https://swarajyamag.com/economy/make-in-india-is-on-track-with-win-win-partnerships-in-the-defence-sector-under-discussion) and the knowledge shared for indigenous manufacturing of such aircrafts in the future.
1.9.1.4.4. Con: India has [lost](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/in-textiles-we-have-lost-the-race-to-bangladesh-vietnam-and-cambodia-ajay-bagga-market-expert/articleshow/52851921.cms) its No.1 Textile status to Bangladesh. The FDI inflow to textiles has been a lot lower than what it should have been.
1.9.1.5. Con: FDI share as percentage of GDP has been declining since 2015 and is a long way behind the [best of 3.6%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.KLT.DINV.WD.GD.ZS?end=2016&locations=IN&start=2005) during the UPA rule \(World bank data\).
1.9.2. Con: The Indian economy has seen several declining trends since Modi took office.
1.9.2.1. Pro: The UPA average was 8.1% GDP growth [as compared](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-clocked-10-08-pc-growth-under-manmohan-singhs-tenure-data-shows/) to the NDA performance at 7.4%
1.9.2.2. Pro: The Indian Rupee has [fallen](https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/bank-of-england-spot/historical-spot-exchange-rates/usd/USD-to-INR-2014#charts) under the Modi regime - it stood at 68.12 Rupees to 1 USD in May 2018, whereas it was as low as 58.47 Rupees to 1 USD in May 2014.
1.9.2.2.1. Pro: This has [led](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/forex-reserves-falling-below-400-billion-not-a-worry-say-experts-118073000042_1.html) to dwindling forex reserves.
1.9.2.2.2. Con: A fall in the currency value is good for India; it makes exports more competitive abroad.
1.9.2.2.2.1. Pro: [Data analysis shows](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/india-china-exports-most-at-risk-from-currency-strength-in-asia/articleshow/63279701.cms) that the Indian economy is especially receptive to changes in the value of the rupee.
1.9.2.2.2.2. Pro: When the rupee last fell in value in 2012-13, [exports grew at a record setting 12.98%.](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/Vs7sGl77X5xbJANqNJ5oHJ/What-the-future-holds-for-Indian-exports.html)
1.9.2.2.2.3. Con: Recent export data is mixed: while exports in 2018 [are up compared to 2017](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/india-s-exports-decline-0-7-in-march-2018-118041400312_1.html), exports actually fell in March and the trade deficit is rising faster than exports.
1.9.2.3. Pro: India's GDP \(gross domestic product\) growth fell during the first six months of 2017 from [7% to 5.7%](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/04/news/economy/india-economy-modi-slowdown/index.html), its slowest pace in three years.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: According to the [government's own estimates](https://www.thenational.ae/business/economy/analysts-say-modi-s-foreign-investment-reforms-don-t-go-far-enough-1.694513), India’s gross domestic product should grow by 6.5 % through 2017 to the 2018 financial year. This is the lowest increase in the last four years.
1.9.2.3.2. Pro: In addition to that, the [method](https://www.firstpost.com/business/revised-gdp-calculation-ministry-of-statistics-says-it-follows-best-international-practices-to-compute-macro-data-4506989.html) of GDP calculation has also been changed. The new series of GDP data is masking a lot of poor growth. The government is also not releasing earlier GDP numbers using the new method.
1.9.2.3.3. Con: It takes a long time for governments to enact new policies, thus one cannot expect positive change to happen immediately.
1.9.2.3.3.1. Con: Policies can be enacted very quickly and have immediate effect \(bad, good, both or none\), for example demonetisation.
1.9.2.3.4. Con: When demonetisation was announced, the economy was considered strong enough to take the blow. If the UPA government left the economy in a very bad shape in 2014 and some recovery happened before demonetisation\( within two years\), the generic argument "things take time" doesn't make sense, given the govt. was supposedly able to pull off a recovery before demonetisation.
1.9.2.4. Pro: There is declining [trend](https://www.firstpost.com/business/revised-gdp-calculation-ministry-of-statistics-says-it-follows-best-international-practices-to-compute-macro-data-4506989.html) in exports & services as against GDP. 45% of India's exports come from SMEs. SMEs' have been made to suffer through an ill-conceived demonetisation act and a haphazard GST implementation.
1.9.2.4.1. Con: All nations revise their CPI estimates from prior years, because CPI only functions when you compare the prices of the same basket of goods in the present and past. These revisions don't mean there is an actual change in the CPI trend.
1.9.2.5. Pro: The measure of investment in any economy - GFCF - Gross Fixed Capital Formation has been [declining sharply](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/gross-fixed-capital-formation-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html) since 2012. The Modi government has done little to halt this trend. It has continued to fall.
1.9.2.6. Pro: Foreign investors have lost faith in the Modi government. FPI outflows have [hit the highest](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/fpi-outflows-hits-10-year-high-at-48000-cr/article24305873.ece) point since January 2008.
1.9.2.7. Pro: [Agriculture exports](https://www.epw.in/engage/article/agrarian-distress-india-short-reading-list?0=ip_login_no_cache%3D473dff6affcbb5a0eb246c9349e01eca) have come down by 21%. At the same time, imports in the same sector have risen by more than 60%.
1.9.2.8. Pro: [New investment is the lowest](http://www.atimes.com/how-modi-has-failed-as-prime-minister-of-india/) it has been in 13 years; bank credit growth has sunk to a 63-year low, while loan growth has fallen to 5.1%.
1.9.3. Con: Modi has [destroyed](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/indian-economy-in-cashless-crisis-after-note-ban-economist/article9528911.ece) the economic backbone of country. [Banking system is in critical state](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/99-percent-of-demonetised-notes-returned-to-system-rbi-data-demonetisation/story/259335.html) with rising NPAs, an aftershock of demonetization.
1.9.4. Pro: Modi has greatly expanded access to the internet, especially in rural areas.
1.9.4.1. Con: As of 2018, rural India still only has [17% internet penetration](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/50-of-indias-internet-users-rural-40-will-be-women-by-2020-bcg/articleshow/59802340.cms) due to network deployment issues.
1.9.4.2. Con: India has the [slowest](https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/m.timesofindia.com/business/india-business/4g-speed-in-india-slowest-in-world/amp_articleshow/63021612.cms) 4G speeds in the world.
1.9.4.2.1. Con: While this might be true, having some internet connection is better than having no internet connectivity at all.
1.9.4.3. Pro: Modi's Digital India initiative is in the process of connecting all 250,000 Gram Panchayats \(local administrative clusters of villages\) with fibre optic cables, and [establishing wifi villages and smart cities.](http://theconversation.com/narendra-modi-indias-social-media-star-struggles-to-get-government-online-73656)
1.9.4.4. Pro: A joint report from [IBM and Kalaari Capital](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/850-mn-internet-users-key-to-indias-1-trillion-digital-economy-report/articleshow/64193359.cms) expects that increasing internet access could add $1 trillion to the Indian GDP by 2025.
1.9.4.5. Pro: [1 out of every 2](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/850-mn-internet-users-key-to-indias-1-trillion-digital-economy-report/articleshow/64193359.cms) internet users is expected to be rural in the next 3 to 4 years.
1.9.5. Pro: India has relaxed foreign investment rules on [aviation, retail and construction.](https://www.thenational.ae/business/economy/analysts-say-modi-s-foreign-investment-reforms-don-t-go-far-enough-1.694513)
1.9.5.1. Con: By opening up FDI in itself doesn't mean a lot, when the same was done in [defence](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-flounders-in-attracting-fdi-in-defence-production-gets-only-rs-1-17-crore-in-4-years/articleshow/63207644.cms), it failed big time. Prudent policies, reasonable taxation, fair labour laws etc. are more important than just blindly opening up FDI.
1.9.6. Con: He has caused a lot of distress on the [rural economy](https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-lok-sabha-2019-elections) and has thus destroyed the informal economy.
1.9.6.1. Pro: In 2017 the BJP instituted [tight regulations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/india-rocked-by-protests-meat-industry-tighter-laws) on the nation's meat industry that ultimately created more financial struggles for Dalits and Muslims, both of which rely heavily on the cattle industry and are among India's poorest demographics.
1.9.7. Pro: Under the BJP government, India became the [world’s fourth-fastest-growing economy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/01/21/indians-are-worse-off-under-modi/#2a6a379f203b) in 2017, according to the World Bank’s latest edition of the [Global Economic Prospects](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/26800).
1.9.7.1. Pro: India is also rated the [fastest growing major economy](https://currentaffairs.gktoday.in/tags/global-economic-prospects) in the survey.
1.9.7.2. Con: The percentage numbers are all derived after [changing the methodology](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/all-about-gdp-methodology-and-why-raghuram-rajan-questioned-it/story/228659.html), to which even Mr. Raghuram Rajan had raised his concerns. Also, the growth that is happening is a [jobless growth](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/oIfsn1Djr4KpR1mNNe1zDN/Indias-jobless-growth-is-not-a-myth.html), so in a way it is not benefitting the middle and lower-middle class or the semi-skilled and un-skilled class.
1.9.8. Con: BJP's [economic policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/world/asia/india-modi-economy.html), such as imposing a new sales tax and voiding most of the nation's currency through the demonetization of high-denomination currency notes, have been responsible for slowing down India's economic growth.
1.9.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.9.8.2. Pro: The implementation of the goods and services tax has led to an increase in unemployment.
1.9.8.2.1. Pro: The closure of businesses as a result of the goods and services tax has eliminated [1.5 million](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/good-bad-and-ugly-of-indias-new-national-sales-tax-journey/articleshow/59748765.cms) jobs.
1.9.8.3. Pro: Demonetization was poorly implemented and negatively impacted a number of industries without fulfilling its stated goals.
1.9.8.3.1. Pro: While intended to end hoarding of large amounts of cash, the way demonetisation was implemented actually [incentivised hoarding](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/rpdrmaTifLZkmIvpDeVs0O/Unintended-consequences-of-demonetisation.html) since the government failed to quickly start circulating the new Rs500 notes. This deprived many parts of the economy of much needed cash inflow.
1.9.8.3.2. Pro: Demonetisation made it difficult for many Indians to access their own savings, which decreased [trust in banks](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/rpdrmaTifLZkmIvpDeVs0O/Unintended-consequences-of-demonetisation.html).
1.9.8.3.3. Pro: People spent hours [waiting at ATMs](http://www.atimes.com/indias-demonitization-policy-fails-address-real-problems/) to withdraw money and thus wasted valuable working hours.
1.9.8.3.4. Pro: Since criminals are more likely to [launder illegal money](http://www.atimes.com/indias-demonitization-policy-fails-address-real-problems/) than to keep it under their bed in boxes full of cash, the measure is unlikely to have affected the black market in any meaningful way.
1.9.8.3.5. Pro: The decision to implement demonetization was taken by Modi alone. He did not even consult the [Governor of the Reserve Bank of India](http://www.atimes.com/indias-demonitization-policy-fails-address-real-problems/), despite the fact that his role would have been crucial to a successful implementation of the policy.
1.9.8.3.6. Pro: The government policy of demonetization has had a negative impact on India's real estate sector.
1.9.8.3.6.1. Pro: The [purchase](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) of new property fell by up to 40% in major cities, while new project announcements fell by 11% immediately after demonetization.
1.9.8.3.6.2. Pro: [Construction firms](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) which dealt in cash were unable to meet their operational expenses like wages and raw materials as a result of demonetization. Consequently, most of the under-construction projects came to a standstill.
1.9.8.3.6.2.1. Con: The lower interest rate scheme as a result of demonetization has [benefited](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) property builders, allowing them to resume their projects which were previously discontinued due to a lack of funds.
1.9.8.3.6.3. Con: Demonetization has led to a [reduction](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) in the interest rate on home loans. This has attracted investment in property, resulting in an increased demand for real estate, and has made it easier for people to afford housing.
1.9.8.3.6.4. Con: Demonetization has improved India's stock market performance and attracted foreign direct investment.
1.9.8.3.6.4.1. Pro: The Indian real estate sector attracted a record high foreign investment of [$5.7 billion](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) in 2016.
1.9.8.3.6.4.2. Pro: The performance of real estate firms on the stock market Bombay Stock Exchange \(BSE\) [improved](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) by 50% during 2016-17, dispelling fears of the ill effects of demonetization.
1.9.8.3.6.5. Con: Demonetization has increased transparency in the purchase and payment system of property in India.
1.9.8.3.6.5.1. Pro: Prior to demonetization, cash transactions were unregulated and unrecorded making it almost impossible for the government to levy taxes on them. Demonetization has brought about transparency in the [valuation system](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) and enabled the government to detect frauds more easily because it was now able to keep track of extremely large cashless transactions.
1.9.8.3.6.5.1.1. Con: [Cashless forms less than 5% of all transactions in India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/cash-is-king-year-after-note-ban-india-still-remains-a-cash-economy/articleshow/61512446.cms).
1.9.8.3.6.5.1.1.1. Con: While true, the Modi government has taken steps to increase the cashless transaction rate and [set a goal of 25 billion cashless transactions this year.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/et-gbs-2017-modi-govt-targets-25-billion-digital-transactions-in-next-financial-year/articleshow/57882035.cms)
1.9.8.3.6.5.2. Pro: The increased transparency in the purchase and payment system of property in India has led to a [boost](https://www.projectguru.in/publications/impact-demonetization-indias-real-estate-sector/) in consumer confidence.
1.9.8.3.7. Pro: Demonetization of high-denomination currency notes \(thereby making illegal [86%](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/10/india-economy-falters-modi-171011114550066.html) of the total currency in circulation\) has led to many firms operating in the cash-only informal sector, which created so many jobs, having to [shut down](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-41332272).
1.9.9. Pro: Inheriting NPAs and debt ridden economy and then finding [permanent solutions](http://www.opindia.com/2018/05/why-modi-government-deserves-huge-applause-for-the-insolvency-and-bankruptcy-code/) to them has been greatest of achievements of 4 years of Narendra Modi government.
1.9.9.1. Con: The cases referred to IBC have hardly had any tangible effect. In fact, to the contrary, the government has announced an infusion of [2.11 lakh crores](https://www.firstpost.com/business/rs-2-11-lakh-crore-recapitalisation-package-will-also-strengthen-psu-banks-balance-sheets-urjit-patel-4245783.html) to the public sector banks.
1.9.9.2. Con: All cases referred to the \(Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code\) [IBC](https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-interpreting-the-insolvency-and-bankruptcy-code/$FILE/ey-interpreting-the-insolvency-and-bankruptcy-code.pdf) have to [take a 50% provision](https://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/prosaic-view/npa-nclt-reserve-bank-of-india-liquidation-banks-ibc-process/story/265782.html) for write-offs the moment it is referred. In reality, this number can go up-to 90% meaning a 10% recovery only.

To augment the same, only [two major cases](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/npa-fix-only-2-from-rbis-dirty-dozen-resolved-under-ibc-what-about-others-is-the-delay-hurting/1160770/) have been solved by IBC.
1.9.10. Con: There is [no visible change](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/01/21/indians-are-worse-off-under-modi/#6f677bfe203b) in major areas like health, education, transport, housing, employment, poverty etc. In the 4 years of governance, things have gone down rather than getting better. Modi was chosen for these issues, but he has completely failed in handling all these issues.
1.9.10.1. Pro: Modi's government has been allocating insufficient funds to and thus weakened important programs such as the [national health mission](https://thewire.in/government/modi-government-lowers-planned-funding-national-health-mission-almost-20) and [MNREGA](https://www.dailyo.in/business/mgnrega-union-budget-2017-arun-jaitley-narendra-modi-bjp-congress-monumental-failure-allocation/story/1/15437.html) \(National Rural Employment Guarantee Act\).
1.9.10.1.1. Pro: Under the Modi government, [spending on the health ministry](https://www.firstpost.com/business/budget-2018-health-education-sanitation-allocation-appears-to-be-most-in-3-years-but-it-isnt-4332137.html) has declined to 2.1 % of the total Union Budget from the previous 2.4 %, in 2017-18.
1.9.11. Con: India is currently experiencing an unemployment crisis and the Modi government is failing to implement straightforward or promised measures to address it.
1.9.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.9.11.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.9.11.3. Pro: Instead of focusing on job creation, the focus is on [showing stats](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/narendra-modi-govt-indian-economy-demonetisation-gst-job-loss-unemployment-5178184/) on job creation, with professors are dubbing "number jugglery".
1.9.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.9.8.2.
1.9.11.5. Pro: There are currently 412,752 [government job vacancies](https://qz.com/1202121/jobs-crisis-the-modi-government-is-sitting-on-more-than-400000-vacancies/) which Modi's government have neglected to fill, which makes the unemployment rate larger than is necessary.
1.9.11.5.1. Con: Filling all these jobs would provide jobs to [less than 2%](https://qz.com/1216899/indias-unemployment-climbs-to-7-at-31-million-and-is-set-to-worsen/) of the unemployed in India, so it wouldn't have any meaningful impact.
1.9.11.6. Con: Improved job scenario.  EPFO data shows 3.1 million new jobs created just between September 2017-February2018.￼ [businesstoday.in](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/epfo-data-3-1-million-new-jobs-employment-created-between-september-february/story/275633.html) Largest manufacturing plant of samsung phones just inaugurated in Noida, India [money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/09/technology/samsung-india-biggest-factory-noida-smartphone/index.html)
1.9.11.6.1. Con: This is the first time EPFO data has been compiled for stats on job creation. The [3.1 million jobs](https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/forcing-conclusions-upon-the-epfo-data/1147335/) added is a total of formalisation of existing jobs \(companies that got registered under EPFO recently already had those jobs\) and new jobs. The ex-CEA himself quotes the same in the link above.
1.9.11.7. Pro: [Over 1.5 million jobs were lost](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/industry/article/demonetisation-effect-15-million-jobs-lost-in-first-4-months-of-the-year/65815) in just the first four months post-demonetization i.e.  from January 2017 to April 2017 as an effect of demonetisation.
1.9.12. Pro: India rose from 130th to 100th place in the World Bank's 2017 ["Ease of Doing Business"](http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings?region=south-asia) rankings, which is encouraging for potential investors.
1.9.12.1. Con: The World Bank's [Ease of Doing Business](http://www.doingbusiness.org/contributors/doing-business/india) rankings do not represent the ground realities. They are based on a very subjective survey of the 'opinions' of an astonishingly tiny segment of people. In fact, the maximum number of respondents on one of the aspects of the rankings was 94 while the minimum was 19. These selected people cannot represent the ease of doing business in the whole of India. This is all just a marketing stunt.
1.9.12.2. Con: The metrics for the ranking have been calculated using data from [Mumbai and Delhi alone](http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/india), so it's not representative of the entire country.
1.9.12.3. Pro: The World Bank credited [decisions](https://thediplomat.com/2017/11/the-ease-of-doing-business-in-india/) made by the Modi government, including an injection of $32 billion into public sector banks to encourage infrastructure investments, and introducing reforms in key areas such as policy restructuring, the protection of minority shareholders' interests, and the simplification of the taxation process, with India's rise in the rankings.
1.9.13. Pro: India is currently the world's fastest growing economy, and both the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.forbes.com/sites/salvatorebabones/2018/01/02/india-will-outgrow-china-in-2018-but-must-invest-in-next-generation-value-chains/#70c4df3544d8) and the [World Bank](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/world-bank-says-india-has-huge-potential-projects-7-3-growth-in-2018/articleshow/62438949.cms) predict that it will hold onto that title for years to come.
1.9.13.1. Con: This is nothing to do with Modi: It has been said several times even [before Modi became PM](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/india-likely-to-be-worlds-largest-economy-by-2050-citi/articleshow/7556397.cms) that India will be the world's largest economy by 2050 or so.
1.9.13.2. Con: Given the low levels of resource utilisation in India, it is easy for the country to quickly attain high levels of growth by making better use of excess resources with [existing technologies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/04/21/indias-economy-on-track-to-beat-china/#1343abb51368). This would be the case regardless of who is prime minister.
1.9.13.3. Pro: The IMF concluded that Modi's goods and services tax and currency exchange initiative were [important sources](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/04/21/indias-economy-on-track-to-beat-china/#1343abb51368) of this economic growth, which means his leadership of the country is directly responsible for the positive developments.
1.9.14. Con: There has been a dramatic increase in [wealth inequality](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/india-wealth-inequality-growing-rapidly-180125084201143.html) in India in the past year alone.
1.9.14.1. Pro: [Income inequality](https://wid.world/document/chancelpiketty2017widworld/) in India today is higher than any time since 1922.
1.9.14.2. Pro: Growth under Modi may exist, but it has been inequitable and only benefitted [selected individuals](https://www.oxfamindia.org/pressrelease/2093). The poor still remain poor.
1.9.14.3. Con: This is a side effect of India rising. Essentially what it means is that the economy is expanding, and the enterprising actors amass more money. [It is not exactly coming from the poor, as it is made to sound like](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/inequality-myth-and-reality-inequality-in-india-crony-capitalism-5301070/). It is definitely a concern, and the antidote for this is for the [government to aid wannabe entrepreneurs](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/game-eyes-creation-of-10-mn-entrepreneurs-50-mn-jobs-by-2030-in-india-118082100863_1.html), and \(through regulators\) to make the playing field level, and making business entry and exit smooth. There [has to a safety net](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/can-indu-bhushan-deliver-pm-modis-promise-of-healthcare/articleshow/65418323.cms) to take care of downtrodden.
1.9.14.4. Con: Absent clear evidence that this was caused by Modi's policies, the fact that this happened during Modi's reign does not prove that he is responsible for this development. Correlation is not the same as causation.
1.9.14.4.1. Pro: The Indian wealth gap and its constant growth is attributed to several factors and cannot be blamed entirely on Modi's policies. For instance, in 1991, [economic restrictions in India were removed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/02/17/in-india-the-rich-are-getting-richer-but-dont-blame-modi-for-it/#1779ff3e2436), but only the upper classes were able to benefit from the newly created opportunities. This was what initially prompted the significant wealth gap, which has only increased over time.
1.9.14.4.1.1. Con: While India has long suffered from income inequality, [the gap has grown significantly in the past year.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/02/17/in-india-the-rich-are-getting-richer-but-dont-blame-modi-for-it/#5be6cf292436) It is unlikely an economic reform from 27 years ago is the cause of this recent development.
1.9.14.4.2. Con: Nonetheless the government would have the power to reduce the gap. If the gap widens it is either due to no intervention or bad policies.
1.9.14.5. Pro: The top 1% own about [73%](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/oxfam-india-wealth-report-income-inequality-richests-poor/story/268541.html) of India's wealth - up drastically from a figure of about 58% from one year before.
1.9.15. Pro: [Inflation](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/from-11-to-2-2-five-charts-explain-vanishing-india-inflation/articleshow/59227745.cms) has remained under check.
1.9.15.1. Pro: Inflation has been [decreasing](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi) ever since Modi was elected Prime Minister in 2014.
1.9.15.2. Con: Low inflation is not good. This was mostly the result of stable rupee and low crude price. But with the [rise in electronic import over the last few years](https://www.livemint.com/Money/vuLmJx8vyCzWpDMGMzZLnN/The-curious-case-of-rising-electronic-imports.html), and now the crude price rise, CAD is seriously affected, which will result in rise of inflation.
1.9.15.3. Con: Inflation remained low owing to low oil prices in 2015 and 2016. With oil prices rising, inflation is expected to [continue increasing](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2018/05/14/india-cpi-inflation-rises-to-458-in-april). The [RBI also raised](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rising-oil-prices-to-hit-private-consumption-says-urjit-patel/article24213062.ece) the repo rate because of oil prices.
1.9.15.4. Con: If inflation is [too low](http://time.com/money/3749245/low-inflation-bad/), this can actually harm the economy.
1.9.16. Pro: Under Modi's leadership, India overtook France and became the [world's sixth biggest](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/india-overtakes-france-as-6th-biggest-economy-in-the-world-1282562-2018-07-11) economy.
1.9.16.1. Con: Due to the differences in population growth and the relative initial prosperity, it would be a shocking economic downturn and failure of the administration if India did not advance in the absolute GDP rankings. Overtaking smaller nations in the ranking is not an indicator of the success of the Indian government, it is merely observation of the expected outcome that would happen regardless of the administration.
1.9.16.2. Con: It is also important to look at [GDP per capita](http://statisticstimes.com/economy/china-vs-india-gdp.php) \(India is 145th in the World\). In absolute terms India would have gotten ahead of France but it has no relevance to kind of lives the French lead, the power France enjoys globally.
1.9.16.2.1. Con: Indian [GDP per capita](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-per-capita) has risen under Modi.
1.9.16.2.1.1. Con: India's per capita GDP has [been rising continuously since 1991](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-per-capita). The current GDP growth is nothing new and is the usual trend of the last 20+ years.
1.9.16.2.1.2. Con: This has nothing to do with Modi because most of the growth happened in states such as [Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, etc.](https://thelogicalindian.com/story-feed/awareness/gdp-india/) where Modi isn’t the ruling party & most south Indian states where production of domestic product increased. The GDP in North Indian states were taken based on spending \(using expenditure method\) such as foreign tours, Rafale rockets, etc. rather than gains through production \(income approach\) which is why the GDSP of these states fallen with BJP but the country’s GDP still grew.
1.9.17. Pro: Under Modi, India has moved up to 57th on the [Global Innovation Index](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/india-maintains-position-as-top-it-exporter-lags-in-ease-of-doing-business/articleshow/64935501.cms?from=mdr), improving from 60th in 2017 and 81st in 2015.
1.9.18. Con: Indians in poverty are suffering under the Modi government.
1.9.18.1. Con: Impoverished Indians have been suffering for generations. The Modi government has not increased the suffering of the impoverished.
1.9.18.1.1. Con: -> See 1.9.6.1.
1.9.18.1.2. Pro: Modi has actually been [outspoken in his condemnation](https://www.theblaze.com/news/2016/09/02/indias-prime-minister-vows-to-upend-centuries-old-poisonous-caste-system) of the caste system and has expressed desire to purge India of its influence; a move that would greatly relieve the suffering of the impoverished by improving social equality.
1.9.18.2. Pro: The Modi government spends just over 1% of GDP on [public healthcare](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/economic-survey/economic-survey-says-indias-public-spending-on-health-well-below-global-average/articleshow/56897993.cms).
1.9.18.2.1. Con: The government has increased the budget for the [National Nutrition Mission](https://www.firstpost.com/business/budget-2018-health-education-sanitation-allocation-appears-to-be-most-in-3-years-but-it-isnt-4332137.html) from Rs 950 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 3,000 crore in 2018-19. This is a program that seeks to reduce stunting, under-nutrition, anemia and low birth weight of babies. This is a particularly important policy as India has the largest number of stunted children \([48.2 million](http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/budget-2018-indias-healthcare-crisis-is-holding-back-national-potential-29517)\).
1.9.18.2.1.1. Con: While funding for health appears to have risen on paper, actual allocations [were larger in 2017-18.](https://www.firstpost.com/business/budget-2018-health-education-sanitation-allocation-appears-to-be-most-in-3-years-but-it-isnt-4332137.html)
1.9.18.2.2. Pro: Many countries that are economically worse off than India are [better with respect](https://theprint.in/opinion/bangladesh-and-tanzania-have-a-lesson-or-two-for-india-on-open-defecation/99275/) to India in open defecation. Bangladesh is 95% open defecation free.
1.9.18.2.3. Pro: Almost [100 million](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/healthcare-costs-land-5cr-indians-in-poverty/articleshow/62076906.cms) Indians are pushed into extreme poverty every year as a result of being forced to pay for their medical care out of their own pocket.
1.9.18.2.4. Con: Modi has [launched a plan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-healthcare/indias-modi-launches-health-insurance-for-100-million-families-ahead-of-elections-idUSKCN1M30ED) to give free health insurance to India's poorest 100 million households.
1.9.18.2.4.1. Con: Five regions \(all of which are controlled by parties other than the BJP\) have [opted out](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/24/asia/modi-healthcare-election-intl/index.html) of the programme on the basis that they believe it to be underfunded, lacking the required infrastructure and a potential source of corruption.
1.9.18.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.1.
1.9.18.4. Con: PM Modi's idea of [Mudra Loan](http://www.employmentnews.gov.in/VOL.%205%20MUDRA%20BANK%20%20TO%20\(FUND%20THE%20REFUND\).pdf) is [enabling individuals](https://abhijeetgautam.wordpress.com/2015/09/20/mudra-bank/) without any discrimination of caste & creed to startup their own business of choice and support their family.
1.9.18.5. Con: The best thing is that the status of being the poorest country is over for India. Every minute 44 people in the country are getting above the poverty line. This is the fastest rate of poverty reduction in the world. This claim has been made in a report released by the American research firm Brookings’s blog, Future Development. [m.dailyhunt.in](https://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/the+samaja+english-epaper-samajen/44+people+coming+out+of+the+poverty+line+every+minute+in+india+report-newsid-91018704)
1.10. Con: The Modi government has failed the Indian education system.
1.10.1. Con: [PM Modi has invited skilled professionals to India](https://youtu.be/uFaOAnKsYDA?t=2543) for improving education in India.
1.10.2. Pro: The government has [not paid](https://www.thequint.com/videos/news-videos/madrasa-teachers-protest-salary-unpaid) the salaries of madrassa teachers for the last 3 years.
1.10.3. Pro: Education has suffered under the Modi regime. Spending has come down from 6.15% of total budget to 3.48% in the period 2014 to 2018  [Budget 2018, firstpost report](https://www.firstpost.com/business/budget-2018-health-education-sanitation-allocation-appears-to-be-most-in-3-years-but-it-isnt-4332137.html)
1.10.4. Con: Modi has written a book to help students pass their Class 10 and 12 exams, called [Exam Warriors.](https://scroll.in/article/867456/nation-of-mugoos-modis-book-for-students-isnt-about-gaining-knowledge-its-about-cracking-exams)
1.10.4.1. Con: The article linked above clearly concedes that Exam Warriors "isn’t about gaining knowledge – it’s about cracking exams." Therefore it is likely that this book will not help students get more qualified.
1.10.4.2. Con: Exams are precisely the problem of our education system. Rather than improving the assessment system in education, you are stressing on summative end term exams. Actually Modi government has withdrawn the [CCE evaluation system](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Class-X-compulsory-board-exam-will-eliminate-CCE-system-in-CBSE-schools/articleshow/56161463.cms) and the [no detention policy](https://www.firstpost.com/india/no-detention-policy-scrapped-experts-criticise-move-say-govt-is-passing-its-responsibility-to-kids-3891899.html). Both of these were aimed at reducing stress of end term exams on students. Exam stress cannot be tackled by some mantras, you have to bring changes in assessment systems.
1.10.4.3. Con: The book doesn't address the existing problems such as enrolment ratio, teacher:student ratio, lack of qualified teachers, or lack of amenities inside the school, such as water, technology etc.. Moreover, the systems needs more reforms and funding as a % of the budget. Primary education was deprioritized in the [Nehruvian model](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/nehrus-approach-to-primary-education-lamentable-amartya/articleshow/9103405.cms), where he opted for IITs instead \(quality higher education first for under-developed economies\). For a PM who decries Nehru almost all the time, Modi chose convenience.
1.10.5. Con: The Modi government launched the new National Education Policy \([NEP](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/new-education-policy-to-focus-on-teaching-girls-better-schools/articleshow/63091458.cms)\) which is aimed to revamp the Indian education system, with emphases to be on girls’ education, strengthening public institutions, special attention on language, sports and mathematics at the school level, and addressing regional inequality.
1.10.5.1. Pro: The NEP particularly aims at making education [more accessible and affordable](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/new-education-policy-to-focus-on-teaching-girls-better-schools/articleshow/63091458.cms) by pushing against the commercialization of education, including enforcing regulation on private coaching.
1.10.5.2. Con: Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana launched in 2015 is just [rebranded consolidation of several schemes](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bjp-has-merely-renamed-19-out-of-23-congress-schemes-report) launched and operational since 2007 by UPA-I. Instead in Mr. Modi's tenure the crime against children have increased, [our children are not safe](https://www.thequint.com/voices/opinion/minor-rapes-in-india-data) leave alone their education future.
1.10.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.10.6. Pro: Under the pretext of giving them more autonomy, the government is pushing universities towards [privatisation](https://www.epw.in/engage/article/autonomy-universities-governments-move-privatise-exclusionary). This will increase the cost of higher education and make it inaccessible to poorer sections of population.
1.10.7. Pro: India's [performance](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/HDR2016_EN_Overview_Web.pdf) on Human Development Index \(UNDP's report\) continues to be the worst out of all BRICS countries.
1.10.7.1. Con: Being the lowest rated of 5 Countries in any index or measurement currently does not suggest a failure on the part of the most recent government. Moreover the [HDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index) is not a tool that can be used to judge an entire education system. For example, Saudi Arabia has an HDI of 0.847, but women are only now being allowed to drive. China is ranked 90 and they have one of the best education systems as suggested by [PISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment) scores \(ranked 6th in Maths and 10th in science\).
1.10.8. Con: School textbooks are undergoing much-needed reformation. [Ancient Indian knowledge](https://postcard.news/finally-ncert-books-undergo-revision-ancient-indian-knowledge-and-traditions-given-prominence-over-colonial-history/) and traditions are being given prominence over colonial history. Real nationalist heroes are highlighted more.
1.10.8.1. Con: By [removing focus](https://www.firstpost.com/india/mughals-disappearing-from-textbooks-across-the-country-as-history-seems-subject-to-change-3903053.html) from more recent historical periods like the Mughal Empire, history classes become less relevant to the lives of students.
1.10.8.2. Con: New textbooks [were written](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/india-modi-culture/) to promote the Hindu nationalist position that India is primarily a state for Hindus.
1.10.9. Con: The Indian education system Modi [inherited](http://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/the-sorry-state-of-education-in-india/) was already in a bad shape, literacy being lower than many other countries. Due to population growth, the number of students in India has increased and not decreased. As such, the Modi government is not a failure in any sense.
1.10.9.1. Con: Whether Modi is good for india can only be established by his performance. Otherwise, if the logic of the parent argument is applied to Modi or to any succeeding government, then most of them by design will inherit situations from preceding governments. So, logically, no succeeding government can be deemed a failure.
1.10.9.2. Con: India's growing population can't be blamed on a specific government. Inheriting a bad system and worsening/not improving it is the problem here.
1.10.9.3. Pro: In fact, dropout rates have declined under Modi. Improvements have begun already, considering he inherited a bad system and needs time for changes to take effect or act on any course corrections that may be required. Drop out rate pre Modi government [Upa dropout rate 2008 to 11 rose from 5.75 to 6.17](http://niti.gov.in/content/dropout-rate-primary-level) dropout rate Modi government [Dropout rate falls 2014-15 to 4.13](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/primary-level-dropout-rate-in-india-was-4-13-in-2014-15-prakash-javadekar-118010400732_1.html)
1.10.10. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.
1.10.11. Con: Modi governments approach to human resource development and education is new and different from the old school of rote learning. Sports university and Railway university are examples of the type of initiatives taken. Student police e cadet program also rolled out. [m.hindustantimes.com](https://m.hindustantimes.com/education/india-s-first-national-sports-university-to-be-set-up-in-manipur/story-dSEKwFEs2sjGfAIJoGbBnO.html)   [www.thebetterindia.com](https://www.thebetterindia.com/143710/railway-university-vadodara-admissions-open/) [www.thehindu.com](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/union-minister-to-launch-national-student-police-cadet-programme/article24466106.ece)
1.10.12. Pro: The government's move to classify a non-existent institute - [Jio University as an institute of eminence](https://www.thehindu.com/education/six-universities-including-jio-institute-to-be-institutions-of-eminence/article24371429.ece) has come under heavy criticism. Globally, academic achievements are measured by quality of output and not by the quantum of funding.
1.10.12.1. Con: Claim is misleading. Pls note Jio institute has been selected as institution of eminence in the greenfield category meaning proposed and not in the brownfield or existing institute category. There is no pertinent reason given for suspicion of foul play. The institutions are selected by a very eminent panel including professors and an ex election commission member and have to meet stringent criteria [Jio institute issue clarified](https://www.news18.com/news/india/jio-institute-picked-as-an-institute-of-eminence-selection-panel-head-explains-why-1806457.html)
1.10.12.1.1. Con: In the first place having a greenfield category to measure academic quality is akin to putting the cart before the wheel. Education is always by outcomes for e.g. research papers, placements etc. It is irresponsible of the govt. to have included such a category. The criteria includes a very vague point that states the institute needs strategic vision. The criteria also talks about the funding.
1.11. Pro: Modi has improved [India's infrastructure](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/JlYQVmRmRpu7ESTqPrkeoO/Infrastructure-in-four-years-of-Modi-govt-A-thumbs-up-for-b.html).
1.11.1. Con: Some of the initiatives such as the [bullet train](https://www.abplive.in/india-news/on-the-cost-of-one-bullet-train-india-can-afford-to-have-800-rajdhani-trains-707353) \(disproportionate cost, use for passengers, reduction in time\) are highly ill-conceived and are not meant to solve real problems with the railway system.
1.11.2. Pro: The Modi government has revived the previously struggling [highway sector](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/JlYQVmRmRpu7ESTqPrkeoO/Infrastructure-in-four-years-of-Modi-govt-A-thumbs-up-for-b.html). The road ministry terminated lagging projects and introduced the hybrid annuity model \(HAM\). As a result, transportation costs have gone down to about 8%, making some industries more competitive against Chinese counterparts.
1.11.3. Pro: In response to India's booming civil aviation sector, the Modi government has launched [NABH Nirman](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/budget/jaitley-seeks-to-boost-airport-capacity-with-nabh-nirman-scheme/article22621481.ece) under which the Airport Authority of India \(AAI\) will expand by more than five times to handle a billion civilian trips a year.
1.11.4. Pro: The government launched [Bharatmala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatmala), an initiative to make rural areas especially around the India-Myanmar border better connected.
1.11.4.1. Pro: 34,800 km of road construction was approved for phase 1 of the project to last through 2022, [with 6,320km of projects already awarded.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/projects-for-6320-km-roads-awarded-under-bharatmala/articleshow/65147246.cms)
1.11.4.2. Con: This is a scheme that has been conceptualized on paper. It is too early to claim this as a major infrastructure push. The [national linking of rivers is a similar project](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-may-declare-inter-state-river-linking-projects-as-national-projects/articleshow/62544432.cms) that is still under construction. Projects like the golden quadrilateral and the earlier one have [under-delivered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Dubey) \(quality, access control, contracting etc.\). This is only slightly better than a manifesto point.
1.11.4.3. Con: Solving the India Myanmar border problem doesn't mean that Modi has improved infrastructure of the whole country. It simply means that infrastructure in that area has been improved.
1.11.5. Pro: The centre has also been trying to leverage roads, railways and waterways to bring India’s logistics costs down to 8% to make the economy competitive. Since long, India has been grappling with high logistics costs of 14% \(as a percentage of the cost of the product\), which make exports uncompetitive vis-à-vis those of China, where logistics costs add up to just about 8-10%.[livemint.com](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/JlYQVmRmRpu7ESTqPrkeoO/Infrastructure-in-four-years-of-Modi-govt-A-thumbs-up-for-b.html)
1.11.5.1. Con: There is no tangible result that the govt. can show towards this objective. Every govt. tries to reduce the cost. A target can be set at 5% also, because targets don't count but achievements do.
1.11.6. Con: NDA still hasn't matched the road building standards that were achieved by UPA-I. Going by [PMO's own data](http://pmgsy.nic.in/E_Briefing_Book.pdf), they are clearly short.
1.11.7. Pro: The government created [a tunnel between AIIMS centres](https://www.financialexpress.com/infrastructure/pm-modi-inaugurates-aiims-underground-tunnel-in-delhi-whats-special-about-the-project/1225062/). This better equips medical professionals and doctors to transport in case of emergency and easily bypass the Delhi traffic.
1.11.8. Pro: 70 years after independence, only 8cr \(80 million\) Indians had access to cooking gas. During Modi's first term, 7cr \(70 million\) were added - now, [80% of Indian households](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/nearly-80-of-indian-households-now-have-access-to-lpg-gas/articleshow/63224218.cms) have an LPG gas connection.
1.11.8.1. Con: The price of subsidies and unsubsidised gas has risen since Modi's arrival which makes it difficult for families to buy cylinders. [Price of non-subsidised LPG hiked by Rs 220 per cylinder](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/price-of-non-subsidised-lpg-hiked-by-rs-220-per-cylinder-160749-2014-01-01)[Prices of subsidised LPG zoom 16 per cent since Modi took charge](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/prices-of-subsidised-lpg-zoom-16-per-cent-since-modi-took-charge-117080300448_1.html)
1.11.9. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.
1.11.10. Pro: By launching cheap connectivity scheme UDAN, Modi has made travel easier.[indiagen.in](https://indiagen.in/udan-cheap-flight-scheme/)
1.11.11. Con: According to [McKinsey](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/india-lags-behind-in-the-development-smart-cities-mckinsey/article24193330.ece), India lags behind the adoption of smart technologies necessary for smart cities. The mission is [yet](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/smart-cities-mission-still-to-build-up-pace/article24081914.ece) to take off.
1.12. Pro: Modi has been combatting corruption in India.
1.12.1. Pro: Post Demonetisation, the Modi Govt de-registered over [100,000 shell companies](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/registration-of-1-lakh-cos-cancelled-37000-shell-firms-identified-pm-modi/articleshow/59402192.cms), blocked their bank accounts and announced "strong action" for 37,000 of these companies.
1.12.2. Con: Modi's main agenda for the 2014 Elections was corruption. However, corruption has [increased many fold and become more rampant](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/02/25/modi-has-been-fighting-corruption-the-wrong-way/#6ce916c82d16) during the Modi regime.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Eleven journalists covering corruption and/or politics have been [murdered](https://cpj.org/data/killed/?status=Killed&motiveConfirmed%5B%5D=Confirmed&type%5B%5D=Journalist&cc_fips%5B%5D=IN&start_year=2014&end_year=2018&group_by=year) in India during Modi's rule.
1.12.3. Con: If that’s the case then Modi wouldn’t be be involved in several scams and corruptions. There are scams from [A-Z](http://www.corruptmodi.com) which only asserts that Modi has not been combating corruption but [increasing](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2018/09/25/A-To-Z-of-scams-Congress-lists-26-scams-of-BJP-in-alphabetical-order.html) it.
1.12.3.1. Con: The referenced link in the parent claim suggests that the Opposition have claimed that there are scams. Congress party has a vested interest in it. These accusations can be motivated with no substantial evidence. Rahul Gandhi, leader of opposition, have [misquoted French President​](https://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/andwordsisallihave/media-carried-away-by-rahul-hug-and-forgets-misquoting-of-french-president/) in the parliament. Hence, credibility of these accusation is questionable.
1.12.4. Con: [35% of the ruling parties 281 members have declared that there are criminal cases pending against them](http://www.satyamevjayate.in/Criminalization-Of-Politics/EPISODE-5articles.aspx?ArtCat=Power-To-You&Episode=EPISODE-5). They are in position of power where they can influence the outcome of a case. A free and fair trial cannot be conducted if the convict is a person in charge of decision making or influencing process.
1.12.4.1. Con: No democratic Prime Minister can do anything about it. The representatives are elected by people's vote. So he can't stop them because they aren't proven guilty. He cannot bring a law against it because the elected members including accused members will vote. Of course, he can't intervene the court's ruling. Any drastic steps taken may not be in the interest of people or it will we undemocratic.
1.12.5. Pro: Under Modi's leadership, the investigative agencies have been doing their job: [investigating the acts](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/government-task-force-identifies-16537-confirmed-shell-companies-97000-more-under-scanner/story/278760.html) of the crooks and the corrupt. These people now live in an atmosphere of unprecedented fear, some have even [run away](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/23000-dollar-millionaires-have-left-india-since-2014/articleshow/63358087.cms) from the country.
1.12.5.1. Con: Modi was unable to apprehend and prosecute Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi accused in [13,000 crore PNB scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_National_Bank_Scam). They escaped out of India. In addition, [Nirav Modi was seen with the Prime Minister](http://www.thehindu.com/business/congress-targets-pm-over-davos-photo-with-nirav-modi/article22762831.ece) and other businessmen at the Davos World Economic Forum just a week before a First Information Report \(FIR\) was filed against him.
1.12.5.2. Pro: [Vijay Mallya's](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/economy/article/vijay-mallya-tired-of-relentless-pursuits-offers-to-settle-dues-worth-rs-13000-crore-to-banks/245991) case is an example of the Modi government's will to pursue economic offenders and take them to task.
1.12.5.3. Con: Modi is protecting the corrupt like Chidambram, Sonia & at least 40 others. Misusing his powers, PMO is sitting on FIRs in even charge-sheet cases.[No action in Sonia Gandhi Antique Smuggling Case - Savior Modi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZN5mqqAi8k)
1.12.5.4. Con: These cases may just be the tip of the ice berg. Without the government being open about the number of corruption cases they are aware of and contrasting this with the number of investigations, pursuing a few prominent cases can hardly be called an overall success.
1.12.5.5. Con: According to the [article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/23000-dollar-millionaires-have-left-india-since-2014/articleshow/63358087.cms) above, so many of India's wealthy are leaving that it may have negative effects on the economy, due to the loss of investment and consumption by the super rich.
1.12.6. Con: Investigative agencies are selective in targeting political opponents. A [case in point](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Govt-let-Reddy-bros-have-the-last-laugh-in-15-cases/articleshow/6174661.cms) is how mining barons of Bellary got the cases against them withdrawn after joining hands with BJP.
1.12.7. Con: India continues to be the one of the [most corrupt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronakdesai/2018/03/07/india-continues-to-be-one-of-the-most-corrupt-countries-in-the-world/#1d40a9ea79c6) countries in Asia.
1.12.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.2.
1.12.8. Con: The government has passed the Finance bill in 2017 that makes it legal to provide anonymous funding to political parties without any [limit](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/web-edits/finance-bill-relaxes-corporate-funding-to-political-parties-but-is-the-move-really-evil-4582020/). This is basically rolling out a red carpet to big time business-government nexus relationships.
1.12.9. Con: Piyush Goel, Cabinet minister in Modi government is accused of corruption. He has sold a company he owned at [nearly 100 times the face value](https://thewire.in/political-economy/in-selling-firm-to-piramal-group-as-minister-piyush-goyal-pushes-ethical-boundaries) to a company that had investments in power and energy sector. He was the minister of state with independent charge of power, coal and energy then.
1.12.10. Con: While the country reeled under demonetization, the BJP arranged back channels for those close to them to change currency through cooperative banks under their control. Allahabad Cooperative bank, with Amit Shah as director, [netted the highest deposits](https://thewire.in/banking/bank-with-amit-shah-as-a-director-collected-highest-amount-of-banned-notes-among-dccbs-rti-reply/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) among such banks. Second highest was Rajkot cooperative bank headed by a state cabinet minister of BJP. Five days later cooperative banks were barred from receiving demonetized currency for fear of money laundering.
1.12.10.1. Con: It's [nothing unusual for the size and performance of the Bank](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/searching-for-sunnylands-in-chinas-nagpur/articleshow/64701571.cms), says NABARD. Moreover, [deposited money has to be shown source for](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/demonetisation-it-notices-to-those-depositing-huge-cash/article9365419.ece); so it does not mean black becomes white.
1.12.11. Con: Between 2014-2017,  more than [2.7 lakh crores of loan](https://www.firstpost.com/business/npa-crisis-loans-worth-rs-2-72-lakh-cr-written-off-since-nda-government-took-over-in-2014-just-rs-29000-cr-recovered-4433627.html) from Public Sector Banks have been written off. Barely [42000 crores](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-data-show-low-npa-recovery/article24146708.ece) were recovered till Dec 2017 \(Jan-Dec 2017\) by PSU banks. The government has not been able to utilise the tools at their disposal \(account closure, ED, cases against the defaulters, asset seizure\) to mitigate the same.
1.12.12. Pro: The [Direct Benefit Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Benefit_Transfer), which entails transfer of subsidies straight into the bank accounts of approximately 250 million beneficiaries is a landmark achievement, eliminating several middlemen, who used to previously pocket most of the money.
1.12.12.1. Con: The scheme [was launched in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Benefit_Transfer), i.e. before Modi became PM. The idea of eliminating middle men is not new.
1.12.12.2. Pro: A government [report](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/direct-benefit-transfer-leads-to-rs-50000-crore-savings-for-government-in-3-years/articleshow/57240387.cms) stated that public savings due to Direct Benefit Transfer over the first three years touched Rs 50,000 crore \(approximately USD 7.7 billion\) as on December 31, 2016.
1.12.12.3. Con: The number is heavily overstated. The savings mainly come from the PAHAL scheme \(cooking gas\) - 50% approx. This number has been exaggerated through aggressive assumptions. CAG has [debunked](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/CAG-audit-nails-Centre%E2%80%99s-claim-on-LPG-subsidy-saving/article14499201.ece) the numbers shown by the centre.
1.12.13. Con: Indian money holding in [swiss banks](http://www.mydigitalfc.com/plan-and-policy/indians%E2%80%99-money-swiss-banks-increases-50-rs-7000-crore-2017) have risen by 50% in 2017.
1.12.13.1. Con: Not all money deposited overseas is illegal money. Only those amounts that have not been taken into account while paying taxes in India are illegal.
1.12.13.2. Pro: Even if all the money was legitimate, the need to look for a foreign bank to hold money says a lot about the confidence and security of Indian banks.
1.12.14. Pro: -> See 1.9.8.3.6.5.
1.12.15. Pro: The Modi government passed the [Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill 2018](http://zeenews.india.com/india/noose-tightened-around-nirav-modi-vijay-mallya-as-lok-sabha-passes-fugitive-economic-offenders-bill-2125904.html) which proposes the formation of a special court under the PMLA to declare a person a fugitive economic offender if such people leave the country. It gives power to the agencies to seize properties which are not only in the name of offender who left the country to escape law, but also the ones that are 'benami'.
1.12.16. Pro: Modi has been fighting economic offenders at various levels.
1.12.16.1. Con: This is just a perception that has been furthered by marketing and media. The government has failed to produce formal reports, data or any structured information that can be used to quantify any of these efforts, such as number of offenders, money recovered. This lack of reliable data undermines the government's claims of success.
1.12.16.2. Pro: Not just the economic offenders but the entire system that facilitates them is being [made accountable](https://www.mid-day.com/articles/axis-bank-officials-agents-arrested-in-rs-360-crore-fraud/19296154).￼
1.13. Con: Modi has been systematically removing democratic checks and balances on his hold on power.
1.13.1. Pro: In order to retain power, Modi has taken action to ensure that any potential political opposition remains fragmented and thus cannot secure a majority vote.
1.13.1.1. Pro: To prevent them from forming an alliance, Modi and BJP president Amit Shah [launched a campaign](https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-india-bjp-shah) aimed at destroying a variety of state-level parties, such as Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party, Bihar's Janata Dal, and Bengal's Trinamool Congress.
1.13.1.2. Con: BJP is not reponsible for opposition losing support from BSP and SP. [Mayawati and Akhilesh blames Congress](https://youtu.be/zbylEjNxS2U?t=113) for arrogance and gives up alliance.
1.13.1.3. Pro: Modi has vowed to get congress out of power in [Karnataka](http://zeenews.india.com/india/in-bengaluru-pm-narendra-modi-vows-to-make-karnataka-congress-free-2078685.htm).
1.13.1.3.1. Con: This has no relevance to the discussion that Modi is good for India.
1.13.1.3.2. Pro: The Congress party in Karnataka [challenges](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/india-congress-party-rahul-gandhi-defeat-modi-180321121331509.html) Modi's power. If Modi uses his position as prime minister to sway voters into making Karnataka "Congress free", it could be seen as an erosion of Indian democracy to increase his own power.
1.13.1.3.2.1. Pro: Having a strong opposition party is often crucial for a healthy democracy, as it ensures that citizens have a viable alternative each election cycle, should the current government fail.
1.13.1.3.2.2. Pro: BJP, Modi's party, have been accused of [bribing](http://zeenews.india.com/karnataka/congress-releases-audio-clip-claiming-bjp-tried-to-lure-its-karnataka-mla-2109487.html) Congress members to break from the party so that BJP retain their lead in Karnataka.
1.13.1.3.3. Con: Congress's or any participant's defeat in an election doesn't reflect on Modi's attitude towards democracy. Other parties can also participate and hold a check on democracy.
1.13.2. Pro: Mr Modi's 2014 General Election's biggest campaign issue was corruption and one of the checks and balances was LOKPAL. After 2014, it is simply [non-existent](https://www.firstpost.com/india/lokpal-appointment-narendra-modi-not-in-favour-of-independent-body-congress-wont-attend-meet-just-to-eat-snacks-4372679.html), and till date there is no setup.
1.13.2.1. Con: The LOKPAL act requires the Leader of Opposition to be involved in the appointment process for it to be legal, but officially there is no Leader of Opposition because Congress has too few seats to qualify.
1.13.3. Pro: By holding such a dominant position politically, the BJP under Modi is eroding democratic values [such as the importance of a strong opposition.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/narendra-modi-india-pm-may-be-popular-but-its-bad-for-democracy/article35883618/)
1.13.4. Pro: Under PM Modi - Governors have been used extensively to stop State functioning \(specially for the State ruled by parties other the BJP\). Case in point AAP in Delhi, Congress in Punjab. Federal structure of State/Centre is being demolished.[thewire.in](https://thewire.in/politics/centre-versus-delhi-government-an-undemocratic-vendetta)[theprint.in](https://theprint.in/opinion/the-modi-govt-hasnt-exactly-upheld-the-spirit-of-federalism-with-its-action-on-aap-posts/50828/)
1.13.4.1. Pro: The Modi government has repeatedly interfered in the functioning of the Delhi government [through the LG](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/delhi-govt-vs-lieutenant-governor-power-struggle-supreme-court-kejriwal-baijal-5246301/), [preventing them from implementing policies](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/l-g-obstructing-every-govt-project-cm/article23396052.ece) that would be beneficial to the public at large.
1.13.5. Pro: Modi has attacked the independence of judiciary through the attempt of forming a National Judicial Appointments Commission \(NJAC\) for appointment and transfer of judges to the higher judiciary. This was an [executive overreach](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-verdict-on-njac-and-collegium-system/article7769266.ece) and the current government still keeps trying to do it. NJAC would have had 6 total members with 3 directly from executive branch or with influence from executive branch.
1.13.6. Con: Modi strengthened democracy, and reduced his hold on power with respect to [public sector banks](https://www.livemint.com/Home-Page/VBg0GkeRIY6qEhU05br7HP/No-interference-from-govt-in-the-internal-workings-of-banks.html) by assuring no interference from him or his office.
1.13.7. Pro: The centre has been very keen on the passing the [RTI amendment bill](http://www.freepressjournal.in/india/centre-confirms-plan-to-amend-rti-act-refuses-to-provide-details-of-amendment-bill/1297962). The details of the amendment [have been refused](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-accused-of-illegally-denying-details-on-rti-act/article24187115.ece) to the public. The bill is expected to be weak and possibly exclude political parties from the purview of the bill. The government took a [U-turn](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/PQxOBEl2XaS1UoAFqzP0mO/BJP-reverses-stand-on-bringingparties-under-RTI.html) on the same.
1.13.8. Pro: [Judge Loya](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-42784830) was found dead few days before the case against BJP party chief Amit Shah. [Various quarters](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/shocking-details-emerge-in-death-of-judge-presiding-over-sohrabuddin-trial-family-breaks-silence) have doubted the nature of the death, stating that it can't be a matter of pure coincidence the ruling judge would die just before verdict.
1.13.8.1. Con: The judge was not "found" dead. He complained of uneasiness after a marriage party and was taken to the hospital by another judge, then later died in the hospital. One of the judges present said there were [no signs of foul play](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/no-justice-loyas-death-not-mysterious-says-judge-who-was-at-hospital-1780684).
1.13.9. Pro: [Lateral entry to certain government positions](https://www.firstpost.com/india/lateral-hiring-gate-crashers-or-talent-pool-are-the-two-ways-ias-officers-may-see-new-entrants-4508845.html) currently held only by civil service officers \(IAS, IPS etc.\) is deemed to be side-stepping the need to clear the [holy and exceptionally difficult UPSC](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/modi-government-to-hire-ten-joint-secretary-from-private-sector-state-governments/story/278834.html).
1.13.9.1. Con: Former PM [Manmohan Singh was a lateral entry](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/centre-government-lateral-entries-joint-secretary-bureaucracy-1295859-2018-07-25) who had held the post of the adviser to the PM on economic affairs. [The selection process is rigorous](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lateral-entry-centre-working-on-rigorous-selection-model/articleshow/64639356.cms) and Modi wants to recruit the best talent available in our country for specialist posts - which is a great move.
1.13.9.2. Con: Lateral entry is of the better ideas by Modi's govt. It will allow experienced specialized and passionate people to join the mid and senior level cadre of the Executive. Also this not something new, it is there all around the world. People complain about how poor the work ethics is off bureaucracy in India, this is an answer to them. [economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lateral-entry-centre-working-on-rigorous-selection-model/articleshow/64639356.cms)
1.13.10. Pro: Modi [changed the system](https://thewire.in/politics/narendra-modi-india-bjp-shah) by which promotions are given out in the military, sending the message that the army no longer serves the constitution but the prime minister.
1.14. Con: The Modi government is turning India into a surveillance state.
1.14.1. Con: Every country has a similar unique identifier for citizens that links to all services. Like the SSN in USA. Linking of this information is just a step in evolution of govt services like in other developed countries.
1.14.2. Pro: The Modi government's argued against the right to privacy as a fundamental right in the Supreme Court.[Right to privacy not a fundamental right: Centre to SC](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/right-to-privacy-not-a-fundamental-right-centre-to-sc/article9790342.ece)
1.14.3. Pro: Until the Supreme Court intervened and [extended the deadlines](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-indefinitely-extends-deadline-for-linking-mobile-phones-passports-new-bank-accounts/article23214939.ece) indefinitely, the government was forcing residents to link their unique aadhaar number to many aspects of their lives including phone connections, bank accounts, tax, investments and for availing any government service. [This enables surveillance](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/aadhaar-enabling-a-form-of-supersurveillance/article22444686.ece) by creating a 360 degree profile of the person.
1.14.3.1. Pro: The govt. has [shied](https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/m.timesofindia.com/india/dont-link-aadhaar-with-voter-id-ravi-shankar-prasad/amp_articleshow/63572290.cms) away from linking the voter ID to the aadhaar card. This could help combat persistent issues such as phantom or duplicate votes. This shows that the government is not interested in real accountability, but only in controlling its citizens.
1.14.3.2. Con: Creating a unique identifier and maintaining a database does not qualify as surveillance and is far from turning towards a surveillance state.
1.14.3.2.1. Con: A unique identifier linked to all services enables surveillance. It is trivial to pull data from all the different systems with the unique identifier and create a 360 degree profile. That is surveillance.
1.14.3.2.2. Pro: This is no different than the United States' system of Social Security Numbers which are also unique identifiers linked with many public and private services. Such systems exist in other countries as well.
1.14.3.2.2.1. Con: It is different from United States' system in two aspects. There is no biometric data associated with it. There is a [privacy law](https://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacy-act-1974) regulating its usage.
1.14.3.3. Con: Far from being sinister, the Aadhaar number system was created in order to to improve privacy, transparency, and inclusion throughout India.
1.14.3.3.1. Con: The aadhaar system is a far cry from being a secure system. There have been multiple leaks. Even the [TRAI chief's](https://www.financialexpress.com/aadhar-card/trai-chiefs-aadhar-challenge-decoded-why-r-s-sharma-gave-out-his-aadhar-number/1264177/) details got hacked.
1.14.3.3.1.1. Con: According to the same article [cited above](https://www.financialexpress.com/aadhar-card/trai-chiefs-aadhar-challenge-decoded-why-r-s-sharma-gave-out-his-aadhar-number/1264177/), Mr Sharma and UIDAI say that no servers were hacked and that the only information found by challengers was what others could have obtained by a determined Google search without the benefit of knowing the Aadhaar number.
1.14.3.3.2. Pro: Unlike previous ID systems, Aadhaar seeks to legitimize and empower as many people as possible by ensuring that every resident is able to secure an ID number regardless of demographics.
1.14.3.3.2.1. Pro: Prior to the introduction of Aadhaar numbers, IDs were often issued on a household basis and typically [only included](https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/were-all-in-this-together-aadhaar-isnt-building-a-surveillance-dystopia-it-asserts-your-individual-identity-vis-a-vis-the-state/) a photo only of the head of the household. This meant that dependents did not have their own individual ID, which consequently singled out women and children.
1.14.3.3.2.2. Pro: Enrollment for Aadhaar [includes](https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/were-all-in-this-together-aadhaar-isnt-building-a-surveillance-dystopia-it-asserts-your-individual-identity-vis-a-vis-the-state/) transgender as an option, does not require proof of address in case an applicant is homeless, and it does not ask women to provide their husband's or father's name.
1.14.3.3.2.3. Pro: Aadhaar numbers are [free](https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/were-all-in-this-together-aadhaar-isnt-building-a-surveillance-dystopia-it-asserts-your-individual-identity-vis-a-vis-the-state/), meaning that those living below the poverty line can acquire an ID with significantly more ease than under previous ID systems.
1.14.3.3.2.3.1. Pro: Prior to the Aadhaar system, acquiring an ID often involved paying [hefty bribes](https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/were-all-in-this-together-aadhaar-isnt-building-a-surveillance-dystopia-it-asserts-your-individual-identity-vis-a-vis-the-state/) to state offices; something that many impoverished residents could not afford to do.
1.14.3.3.3. Pro: Aadhaar has eliminated much of the corruption and fraud that plagued other ID systems in India.
1.14.3.3.3.1. Pro: By using biometric and demographic data to assign residents Aadhaar numbers, it is [significantly more difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar#Fraud) than ever before to either duplicate an existing ID or create a false one using fake records.
1.14.3.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.3.3.2.3.1.
1.14.3.3.4. Pro: Contrary to popular belief, the Aadhaar linking system is a [one-way process](https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/were-all-in-this-together-aadhaar-isnt-building-a-surveillance-dystopia-it-asserts-your-individual-identity-vis-a-vis-the-state/) done only for the purpose of authentication. This means that linking to a bank account, for example, would provide the bank with one's Aadhaar number but the UIDAI would receive no data in from the bank in return.
1.14.3.3.4.1. Pro: The UIDAI also does not receive any data regarding where or why someone's Aadhaar number was used, but simply that it was used as a means of authenticating their identity.
1.14.3.3.5. Pro: By [introducing](https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/were-all-in-this-together-aadhaar-isnt-building-a-surveillance-dystopia-it-asserts-your-individual-identity-vis-a-vis-the-state/) virtual IDs and mandatory tokenization, the UIDAI has helped improve security and protect user privacy.
1.14.3.3.6. Con: The Aadhaar system was merely marketed to do that but in reality if has only led to the loss of privacy to it’s citizens. Even the computer security specialist [Edward Snowden has commented on this](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/probe-uidai-not-scribe-for-aadhaar-breach-snowden/articleshow/62436393.cms), [the data of over 1 billion users have been sold for merely ₹500](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-500-10-minutes-and-you-have-access-to-billion-aadhaar-details/523361.html) and [a French hacker has hacked it multiple times just](https://scroll.in/magazine/872352/who-is-elliot-alderson-the-vigilante-hacker-taking-down-uidai-one-tweet-at-a-time) to show how insecure it is. So right now no matter how much the GoI pours to secure it, the leaked data is already out there. 1b+ is a serious number esp. since it’s linked to banks!
1.14.4. Pro: The Modi government fast tracked the central monitoring system which allows government agencies to bypass phone and internet service providers to [directly intercept communications](https://scroll.in/article/729809/why-indians-must-resist-the-modi-governments-planned-surveillance-system). There is no transparency on the collection or usage of this data.
1.14.5. Pro: The government has issued a [bid](http://www.becil.com/uploads/tender/TendernoticeBECIL01pdf-04836224e38fdb96422221c4e057f6c5.pdf) to create a "Social media communication hub" to [create detailed profiles of citizens](https://scroll.in/article/879833/government-plans-to-monitor-individual-social-media-users-to-gauge-opinion-about-official-policies) by collecting intimate personal details from their social media profiles.
1.14.5.1. Con: This is a sign of good governance, because getting feedback from grassroots is most important.
1.14.5.1.1. Con: Feedback and data collection without consent aren't the same thing.
1.14.6. Pro: The government spending large amounts of money on internet surveillance is, arguably, a waste of money in India, a country where, in 2015, only [26 percent of the population](https://www.statista.com/topics/2157/internet-usage-in-india/) have access to the internet.
1.14.6.1. Con: The number of internet users in India is expected to almost double by [2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/255146/number-of-internet-users-in-india/).
1.15. Pro: Modi has been strengthening India as a global and regional player.
1.15.1. Con: India's global position as a nuclear power was strengthened far more under the UPA government when PM Singh signed the US - India Civil Nuclear Agreement and when the NSG lifted its nuclear trade embargo against India in 2008. [No further progress](http://carnegieendowment.org/2018/02/13/eyes-on-prize-india-s-pursuit-of-membership-in-nuclear-suppliers-group-pub-75535) has been made under PM Modi on this front.
1.15.1.1. Con: It was for a civil nuclear deal. That did not make India a "Nuclear" power. That was during Mrs. Gandhi's and Mr. Vajpayee's times. Moreover, we need to get to further civil nuclear deals \(reactors, etc\) on OUR terms. With Solar getting cheaper so fast, we need to reevaluate and recalibrate the plan.
1.15.2. Pro: India is the [largest producer](http://vikaspedia.in/agriculture/crop-production/package-of-practices/pulses/pulses-in-india) \(25% of global production\), consumer \(27% of world consumption\) and importer \(14%\) of pulses in the world. [PM Modi has partnered with Mozambique](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pm-modi-returns-africa-visit-kenya-south-africa-mozambique-tanzania-africa-2908322/) in order to reduce the cost of importing pulses. The two countries signed three pacts, including a significant “long-term agreement” under which India will buy pulses to meet its recurring shortfall and contain prices of the commodity.
1.15.3. Pro: India under Modi has focused on creating a free trade deal with the [Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/india-wants-quick-deal-on-bimstec-free-trade/article9804766.ece)
1.15.4. Pro: Part of the PM's "[Modi doctrine](http://www.ciis.org.cn/english/2018-01/25/content_40203016.htm)" is helping India attain Great Power status.
1.15.5. Pro: Modi has been placing importance on Indian values and traditions, leveraging India's cultural history in a way that strengthens the country's international position.
1.15.5.1. Pro: Modi highlights verses from our vedic/ancient scriptures in his speeches. His speeches abroad always highlights Indias culture, inclusiveness and diversity. [Modi's speech at World Economic Forum](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/72bxI7oKVms3Hh0wylWXCJ/Narendra-Modis-Davos-speech-reason-of-pride-for-Indians-Am.html) : "Our scriptures, written thousands of years ago, speak about ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’. We are all united by our shared destinies,” he said.
1.15.5.2. Pro: PM Modi has promoted preventive-healthcare by promoting Yoga to the world. He has created a new movement of avoiding diseases as healthcare.[He proposed the idea of international yoga day in UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_of_Yoga#Origin) and 177 nations co-sponsored the resolution.
1.15.6. Pro: France and India as the two countries inked [14 pacts](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/modi-macron-to-deepen-india-france-ties-full-text-of-joint-statement-118031000386_1.html) worth $16 billion in key areas of defence, security and nuclear energy.
1.15.7. Pro: Japan's relationship with India has improved drastically. [Japan invests in India upto $35Bn​](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/japan-commits-35-bn-investment-in-india-114090200026_1.html).
1.15.8. Pro: India was admitted into [MTCR](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-36648279) in 2016, [Wassenaar Arrangement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassenaar_Arrangement#Membership) in 2017 and the [Australia Group](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-admitted-to-australia-group/article22475433.ece) in 2018.
1.15.9. Con: India's relationship with Maldives has sunk to a new low. Indian nationals [aren't allowed](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/downturn-in-ties-with-maldives-hits-indians-job-opportunities/article24156903.ece) to work in Maldives anymore.
1.15.10. Con: With the developments over [Assumption Island in Seychelles](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/india-seychelles-military-base-plan-hits-choppy-waters-180321150926691.html), India has ceded substantial ground to China.
1.15.10.1. Con: Modi initiated the plan to found a military base in the Seychelles. While the failure to reach a deal is not good, it does not mean that India has lost ground; the Seychelles also refused a Chinese military base.
1.15.11. Pro: India has become an important regional counterweight to a rising China under Modi.
1.15.11.1. Con: The Modi government has [lost ground to China](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/china-muscling-out-india-in-sri-lanka-with-money-power/articleshow/65100502.cms?from=mdr) in its relationship with Sri Lanka.
1.15.11.2. Con: Modi [held an informal summit](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/27/asia/modi-xi-wuhan-meeting-intl/index.html) with Xi Jinping, with the goal of building a cooperative, and not combative, Sino-Indian relationship.
1.15.11.3. Con: The growth of China could be good for India, but opposition to China by Modi is preventing cooperation.
1.15.11.3.1. Pro: China and India [have set up working groups](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2b73/d99ae97f793debc519f8bb70ebefc0679885.pdf) to resolve border disputes \(p. 453\) peacefully, but Modi has understaffed these groups.
1.15.11.3.2. Pro: China and India [have naturally complimentary economies](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2b73/d99ae97f793debc519f8bb70ebefc0679885.pdf) \(p. 455\), and were hurt by Modi's increase in tariffs.
1.15.11.4. Pro: India is the only country that has consistently opposed China's Belt and Road Initiative and actually seems to a have a [strategy of its own](https://www.swp-berlin.org/fileadmin/contents/products/comments/2018C07_wgn_Tripathi.pdf).
1.15.11.5. Pro: On the back of growing Chinese naval activity in the Indian Ocean region, the Modi administration has introduced [Project Mausam](https://indiaculture.nic.in/project-mausam), to rival the Chinese Maritime Silk Road \(MSR\) initiative.
1.15.12. Con: With [Trump weighing down on the Iran deal](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/trump-press-allies-to-quit-importing-iranian-oil-by-nov-4.html), India has been forced to cut oil supplies from Iran by November 4 2018. Given that we can procure oil from Iran [at a significantly cheaper price](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-raise-iran-oil-curbs-with-us/articleshow/64862559.cms), India's national interests will take a [serious toll](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/India-Folds-Under-Pressure-Halts-Iranian-Oil-Imports.html). This will also jeopardize the India-Iran relationship.
1.15.12.1. Con: India to continue Iranian oil imports post [US sanctions](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/india-to-continue-iranian-oil-imports-post-us-sanctions/articleshow/66088584.cms).
1.15.13. Pro: Modi has helped stabilize Nepal.
1.15.13.1. Pro: Modi has distanced the government of India from Indian-originated rebels in [Southern Nepal.](http://www.business-standard.com/article/international/pm-modi-india-wants-to-see-nepal-united-inclusive-stable-115101900754_1.html)
1.15.13.2. Pro: Modi has undertaken initiatives to increase revenue by tourism in both India and Nepal, for example, by launching a bus service from [Nepal to Ayodhya](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/narendra-modi-nepal-visit-ayodhya-to-janakpur-bus-service-kp-oli-5169042/) \(a famous Hindu site\) and by launching the [Ramayana Tourism Circuit Project](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/the-ramayana-circuit-all-you-need-to-know-2356501.html).
1.15.13.2.1. Con: Modi's political party, the BJP, rose to prominence in the 1980's by protesting and [eventually destroying a mosque in Ayodhya](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-hindu-explains-the-babri-masjid-case/article21248813.ece) to be replaced by a Hindu temple, and Ayodhya remains central in the BJP's ideology. Thus, the goal of these tourism projects is more ideological for the BJP than economic.
1.15.13.3. Pro: In 2015, Modi-led India pledged [$1 billion](http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/india-announces-1-billion-aid-for-rebuilding-nepal/98435.html) in assistance to earthquake-ravaged Nepal for its massive reconstruction programme which ensured that the country got back to its feet relatively quickly. The Nepalese government made it a point to publicly thank the Modi administration for its "[tremendous assistance.](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/nepal-earthquake-kathmandu-welcomes-thanks-india-rescue-operations-says-un-2264854.html)"
1.15.14. Con: Nepal is creating a China 2.0 relationship and the current PM came to power on the back of an [anti-India campaign](http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-07-15/liquid-nationalism.html) owing to the [2015 blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Nepal_blockade) created by India.
1.15.15. Con: Modi's foreign policy has [frayed](http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-russia-relation-prime-minister-narendra-modi-vladimir-putin-3051614/) India's relationship with formerly strong ally Russia. Russia conducted its first ever military exercise with the Pakistan Army recently, and this was caused almost directly because of Modi's foreign policy initiatives.
1.15.15.1. Con: India-Russia relations have also been impacted by external factors. Recently, the [Russia-China relationship](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/07/02/future-of-the-india-russia-relationship-post-sochi-summit/) has strengthened. Both countries have been challenged by the United States. While China has been able to sustain the competition, Russia's weak economy made it dependent on China for cooperation. As a result, relations between Russia and Pakistan have also strengthened, due to strong Pakistan-China relations, which has in turn adversely impacted Indian relations with Russia.
1.15.15.2. Con: It has not frayed at all, instead, [we are getting to make mature choices best for our needs](https://www.deccanchronicle.com/opinion/op-ed/030518/of-us-russia-indias-arms-bazar.html).
1.15.15.3. Pro: Russia has been willing to provide military hardware such as nuclear-powered submarines to India, which the U.S. [is unwilling to provide.](https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/it-s-time-india-got-real-about-its-ties-with-russia/story-bHptwdAhJwTeDQ5DKwjwXO.html)
1.15.15.4. Con: Putin assures [Russia-Pakistan ties are good](https://www.dawn.com/news/1150106) for India as it is aimed at improving the counter-terrorism and anti-drug operations.
1.15.15.5. Con: As the new world order is taking shape, relying only on Russia would have been a big mistake. Also, Russia is eager to sell their [S400](https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2017-04-25/russia-and-india-test-hypersonic-and-supersonic-missiles) and deliberate talks on [Hypersonic missiles](https://www.thestatesman.com/india/russia-keen-to-sell-s-400-missile-defence-system-to-india-1502559197.html) development in joint cooperation with India shows that Russia too acknowledges the fact.
1.15.16. Pro: Modi has invested [significant effort](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/martand-jha/5-foreign-policy-trends-in-three-years-of-the-modi-government_a_22121586/) into building India's engagement with the US, having already paid multiple visits to America since assuming office.
1.15.16.1. Con: The positive outcomes from these efforts have been limited: Trump's trade disruption tactics have revoked some of the [privileges](https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/us-import-tariffs-on-steel-aluminium-india-hits-back-to-suspend-concessions-on-30-products-5219944/) \(aluminium and steel imports\) India previously enjoyed with the US.
1.15.16.2. Con: US continues to blow hot and cold with India - The 2+2 dialogue between India and US [has been postponed](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/us-postpones-22-dialogue-with-india-due-to-unavoidable-reasons-mea/articleshow/64769208.cms)  [again.](https://scroll.in/article/884415/does-2-2-0-another-postponement-of-dialogue-raises-questions-about-indo-us-ties-in-trump-modi-era) \(3 times in 6 months\).
1.15.16.2.1. Con: You can see that it happened now. US has its domestic compulsions, but looks like they are [adjusting the rules for India](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/us-india-military-deal-iran-russia-trump-modi-putin-a8525736.html). Hence it's the other way around :-\). On the 2+2, what a sight to see the two lady ministers standing on an equal footing, with the US Secretaries!
1.15.16.2.2. Pro: The 2+2 didn't yield important results in favour of India - the [Iran procurement sanction and the procurement of missiles from Russia](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-waiver-us-wants-all-to-import-zero-oil-from-iran/articleshow/65710612.cms). The only deal that got signed was something that benefits USA more.
1.15.16.3. Con: India's expected [to fold under US pressure](https://scroll.in/article/815307/how-india-is-auditioning-for-the-role-of-us-sidekick) rather than play as an equal partner with the US in geo-politics.
1.16. Con: Modi has no original ideas on any aspect of governance. All his projects since his days of Chief Ministerships have been window-dressed versions of someone else's concepts.
1.16.1. Con: He has managed to enfuse dynamism and energy in flailing ideas keeping a desirable future in mind. [Digital India](https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/cross-border-data-flow-to-contribute-to-indias-digital-economy-sundar-pichai-5150221.html), [Make in India](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/huge-india-saves-rs-3-lakh-crore-in-last-4-years-as-modis-make-in-india-helps-make-this-one-thing-at-home/1289184/) for example.
1.16.2. Con: It is neither essential nor sufficient to have original ideas. Even if it was true that Modi had no original idea \(a claim that is quite frankly very economical with the truth\), it is hard to argue that Modi has not worked hard towards implementing right ideas. Intent and direction are much more important. In any stable democracy, continuity on high-level policy issues is actually a desirable trait!
1.16.3. Pro: When in opposition, [BJP called Aadhar a fraud scheme](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-flip-flop-when-the-bjp-called-it-a-fraud-scheme-aimed-at-legalising-illegal-immigrants/story-tRxUVr8qTDbPHwInD7m3tN.html) aimed at legalising illegal immigrants; when in power, they made it mandatory for a host of services. Even the [Modi Government accepted that Aadhar was a great initiative of the Congress regime](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-admits-aadhaar-was-great-initiative-of-congress-regime/story-kkkwSeNMhCmHSNbvJoaI9I.html).
1.16.3.1. Con: Aadhar was introduced by Congress but they didn't have vision to use it as India's identity system like Social Security Number in USA. Now they are afraid to see how Modi is using it effectively. This is a tactic in politics. Every policy introduced by Modi will be opposed by Congress and vice versa.
1.16.4. Pro: When in opposition, they [opposed](https://www.governancenow.com/news/regular-story/-recalling-a-time-when-bjp-opposed-gst--) Goods and Services Tax \(GST\); when in power they implemented it.
1.16.4.1. Con: If Manmohan was not able to pass the bill, it is Manmohan's/Sonia's inability to bring people together for national cause. Policy paralysis was at the peak. If we look back read this : [UPA's 10-year report card: Scams, policy paralysis crashes India's economy](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/india-manmohan-singh-upa-scams-policy-paralysis-gdp-growth-rate-economy-178631-2014-01-28)
1.16.4.1.1. Con: The failures of the UPA does not justify Modi now supporting a policy he once fought so hard against.
1.16.4.2. Con: In 2011 GST had known shortcomings. The short comings were addressed in [2014 Constitutional Bill \(122nd Amendment\)](https://www.mapsofindia.com/my-india/government/comparison-of-goods-and-services-tax-bill-under-upa-ii-and-nda). Opposing the bill was not done to block the bill unfairly. For example, GST council now has one member from each state and union territory. This gives fair chance to each stakeholder in the GST council. GST council in 2011 had only 3 members. New amendment had made the process more democratic.
1.16.5. Con: Presuming he has just used other people’s ideas, still he has done wonders with the same and have effectively used the ideas for the betterment of the citizens and the country. A good idea if badly implemented is a failure and he has converted failed ideas into success. He has tried to complete all projects which were announced years before.
1.16.6. Con: Regardless of whether demonetization was beneficial or detrimental to the Indian economy, it was planned and executed exclusively by the Modi government.
1.16.6.1. Con: Demonetization proved to have little benefit for the country, mostly due to the poor execution. [The country's central bank revealed](https://www.dw.com/en/narendra-modis-4-years-in-power-good-or-bad-for-india/a-43974581) that nearly all demonetized currency had returned to the system. Currency worth $235 billion has been deposited in banks, which means that either there was no significant black money, or hoarders found a way to legitimize most of their ill-gotten cash.
1.16.6.2. Con: This is by no means exclusive, the Indira Gandhi government carried out [demonetisation](https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/history-of-demonetisation-when-morarji-desai-government-ceased-rs-500-rs-1000-and-rs-10000-notes/441874/) with the set of tools available at that time.
1.16.7. Pro: The Swatch Bharat Abhiyaan, which Modi claims as his own idea, was actually [floated by UPA](https://www.firstpost.com/politics/modis-swachh-bharat-abhiyan-nothing-new-upa-scheme-says-chidambaram-1740661.html). However in advertising this and other schemes, the Modi government has spent more on [advertisements](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-govt-spent-3755-cr-on-publicity-reveals-rti-query/article21342718.ece) than actual expenditure on schemes.
1.16.7.1. Con: To make a culture change is difficult. This is not something that can be police-enforced. It's important that the message reaches the citizens. It behooves the educated people to focus on the message and educate the less fortunate ones. This decry on expense is a distraction.
1.16.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.3.3.
1.16.7.1.2. Pro: Culture is so deeply tied to a person's way of life that it is difficult to change even when targeted directly.
1.16.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.18.2.2.
1.16.7.3. Con: A lot of people have a lot of ideas. But, execution is what matters. Positive impact has been felt in the [medical waste area](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Swachh-Bharat-Abhiyan-shows-its-impact-in-medical-field/articleshow/49275813.cms).
1.16.7.4. Con: Success stories of Swachh Bharat have happened, but the problem is that this is good news, and doesn't catch the fancy of the media or the people. From [yourstory.com](https://yourstory.com/2018/01/swachh-bharat-success-stories/)
1.16.7.4.1. Con: More than media, the government hasn't taken any steps to let independent bodies publish reports on the progress of Swachch Bharat. In fact we are not able to utilise a [sanctioned loan](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/25-years-swachh-bharat-missions-claims-remain-unverified-62556) \(due from July 2016\) from World Bank because [the government is scared](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/world-bank-yet-to-release-fund-for-swachh-bharat/articleshow/56429289.cms) to let an independent body to track the progress. To put it in a nutshell, the world bank calls the scheme "moderately unsatisfactory".
1.16.7.5. Pro: The progress has been inadequate that the World bank hasn't even released the first instalment \(due on July 2016\) [of the promised loan](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/world-bank-yet-to-release-fund-for-swachh-bharat/articleshow/56429289.cms).
1.16.8. Con: Instead of making people rely on the government, Modi has been encouraging people to help themselves through projects such as Mudra loan. Rather than continuing past failed poverty eradication policies, Modi's approach will give people seed money for their own business and self esteem.
1.17. Con: Modi is dividing rather than uniting India.
1.17.1. Pro: The Modi govt. is [trying to split](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/bjp-mla-demands-separate-statehood-for-north-karnataka-2773121.html) the prosperous state of Karnataka for political gains. North and coastal Karnataka are areas which BJP is trying to fortify, especially after their voting patterns in the most recent assembly election. This will be detrimental to the economy of the state.
1.17.2. Pro: Modi's BJP party is aiming to turn India into a '[Hindu rashtra](https://www.firstpost.com/india/india-will-become-hindu-rashtra-by-2024-says-uttar-pradeshs-bjp-mla-surendra-singh-4302275.html)' by 2024, meaning that the country will no longer tolerate cultural heterogeneity.
1.17.2.1. Pro: An MLA of the BJP [publicly stated](https://www.firstpost.com/india/india-will-become-hindu-rashtra-by-2024-says-uttar-pradeshs-bjp-mla-surendra-singh-4302275.html) that once this level of homogeneity has been accomplished, only those Muslims who are willing to assimilate to Hindu culture can stay in the country.
1.17.2.2. Con: The words of individual party members should not be interpreted as the official stance of the entire party, since the BJP has made no official statement in recent years to signify that a Hindu rashtra is in fact the party's goal.
1.17.3. Pro: Modi has worsened the North-South divide.
1.17.3.1. Pro: Modi's [new tax plan](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/the-latest-humiliation-by-bjp-of-southern-states-by-mihir-swarup-sharma-1827296) has ensured that the northern Hindi heartland will get a larger share of benefits from federal taxes, further entrenching the North-South divide.
1.17.3.1.1. Pro: Due to progressive reforms, such as women empowerment, the population of the South has not grown at the same rate as the North in India. Previously, this [demographic change](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/in-india-north-south-divide-grows-more-dangerous-1842495) was ignored and for all tax purposes, the census of 1971 was followed, in order to prevent the South from becoming a permanent political minority. This age-old compromise has been abandoned by the Modi government who has decided to follow the 2011 census; a move which will significantly reduce the amount of revenue received.
1.17.3.2. Pro: These efforts don't seem to be working. When Modi [visited the southern city of Chennai recently](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/in-india-north-south-divide-grows-more-dangerous-1842495), he was welcomed by half the city who had turned out to wave black flags at his motorcade, as well as banners that read "Go Back, Modi."
1.17.3.3. Pro: Modi's government has also been accused of [diverting money](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/in-india-north-south-divide-grows-more-dangerous-1842495) from the South to the North. An example of this can be how Tamil Nadu gets back 30 rupees for every 100 it sends to New Delhi, while the northern state of Bihar, by contrast, receives 219 rupees.
1.17.3.3.1. Con: Bihar is facing more challenges than other state. In 2012-2013 it had [lowest per capita electricity](http://finance.bih.nic.in/Reports/Economic-Survey-2014-EN.pdf) consumption. [Per capita income in the state](https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/percapitaincome.htm) in the same year was [less than half of the country's average](http://finance.bih.nic.in/Reports/Economic-Survey-2014-EN.pdf). Diverting money from richer state like Tamil Nadu to backward state like Bihar is in interest of reducing North-South divide.
1.17.4. Pro: The decision related to the [Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/partition-not-religion-should-decide-citizenship-claims/articleshow/64491153.cms) to exclude people based on religion and not on "partition" clearly shows the divisive motive of the government.
1.17.5. Con: No government schemes are launched exclusively for a religion.[All his speeches he says about unity and diversity of India](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFaOAnKsYDA). Modi is not doing any divide and rule. His idol is Sardar Vallabhai Patel who united all princely states of India into a secular Republic of India.
1.17.6. Con: Modi Govt has reduced the erstwhile government policies of minority appeasement. This will bring more harmony in the society and also soothen the majority community who has been its victim for long.
1.17.6.1. Pro: The BJP plans to center Hindu culture, and calls on assimilation into a [Hindu Rashtra.](https://www.firstpost.com/india/india-will-become-hindu-rashtra-by-2024-says-uttar-pradeshs-bjp-mla-surendra-singh-4302275.html)
1.17.6.2. Pro: The Modi government is promoting the use of [Hindi as a unifying national language.](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hindi-our-national-language-cant-progress-without-it-venkaiah-naidu-1716504)
1.17.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
1.17.8. Pro: Language through measure such as one nation one language, govt. communications only in Hindi. [Venkaiah Naidu](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/hindi-our-national-language-cant-progress-without-it-venkaiah-naidu-1716504). This is bad for India as we are a multi-cultural diverse nation where the constitution explicitly states we have no national language \(18 recognised\). This is strong majoritarianism. Language and culture go hand-in-hand.
1.17.9. Pro: His silence encourages mobs and lynching.
1.17.9.1. Pro: Biggest weakness of Narendra Modi's government has been its [inability to rein in vigilantes](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/06/28/rise-in-lynch-mobs-attacks-on-muslims-by-cow-vigilantes-under-m_a_23005424/) that attack Muslims. So much so, Mr. Modi did not express any kind words that would heal wounds in the face of gross injustice.
1.17.10. Pro: -> See 1.3.11.
1.17.11. Pro: A number of nationalist social policies enacted by the Modi government have been accused of being orchestrated "with the intention to create [confrontation and polarisation.](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modi-deliberately-dividing-india-says-bjp-leader-arun-shourie/article8566849.ece)”
1.17.11.1. Pro: Many of the policies introduced by the Modi government share a common theme, one that links things like Ghar-Wapsi, the beef bans, the campaign against anti-nationalism and the increased focus on ‘ Bharat Mata Ki Jai’. This theme is divisive and the Modi government is accused of deliberately dividing India through the scheme of ['divide and rule'](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modi-deliberately-dividing-india-says-bjp-leader-arun-shourie/article8566849.ece).
1.17.12. Con: Modi unites India, government's policies directly touch the village level people. Remarkable development in health and social welfare.[Four years of Modi government: Here's how the key welfare schemes have performed](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/four-years-of-modi-government-heres-how-key-welfare-scheme-have-performed-2576277.html)
1.18. Pro: Modi has improved Indians' quality of life.
1.18.1. Con: [Various](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patidar_reservation_agitation) [communities](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/maratha-reservation-stir-protests-turn-violent-in-pune/videoshow/65203862.cms) have expressed their anger at the government for failing to improve their economic/social prosperity. This has led to large-scale violence and loss of property.
1.18.2. Con: India ranked [55th](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/global-hunger-index-report-2014-released-india-ranked-at-55th-position-1413285606-1) on the Global Hunger Index in 2014 and in 2017, its rank fell to [100th](https://cdn.relaymedia.com/amp/www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/india-is-hungrier-than-north-korea). Such a drastic decrease in its rank shows that the conditions and lifestyles of Indians have not significantly improved as many Indian people still struggle to attain a necessity as basic as food.
1.18.2.1. Con: The situation in 2014 is reflected in the report released in 2015 and not 2014 \(data is at least one year old\). In 2014, India was ranked 55 out of 74 countries. In 2015 report \(i.e. 2014 data\) India was already at 80th position in a list of 104 countries. In 2018 report, there are 129 countries in the survey, and 25 new countries are added. The rank of India is now 100 in 2017 report \( 2016 data\). It does not tell us that the rank has slipped, as claimed. Source: [ifpri.org](http://www.ifpri.org/previous-global-hunger-index-ghi-reports)
1.18.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.8.
1.18.4. Pro: Modi has started a medical-healthcare revolution
1.18.4.1. Pro: [Reduced price of life saving heart stents](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/price-control-on-stents-to-continue-govt/articleshow/63034241.cms) which were priced 1Lakh and above. India has over 6 crore cardiac patients, out of which 5-5.5 lakh undergo the stent procedure. About Rs 5,500-6,000 crore has been saved from the price capping of stents.
1.18.4.2. Pro: 3,600+ [Jan Aushadhi Kendras](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-to-strengthen-supply-chain-of-jan-aushadhi-stores/articleshow/64526716.cms) to provide quality drugs at affordable prices across the country. Will save money & break Doctor-Medical shop nexus at least to some extent.
1.18.4.3. Pro: The government recently started [selling affordable biodegradable sanitary napkins](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/govt-to-boost-supply-chain-of-jan-aushadhi-stores-by-setting-up-warehouses-118061000129_1.html), priced at Rs 2.50 per pad, from Jan Aushadhi stores under PMBJP scheme. Little known fact not highlighted much by media.
1.18.4.3.1. Con: The scheme was originally launched in 2010, since inception despite change of governance the scheme has been effected by supply chain issues, ignorance of use, and disposal of used pads. There is [nothing](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/zbk4JLAnsoHjmbvp1rgeNJ/Use-of-sanitary-pads-sparse-despite-govt-schemes-studies.html) to boast about.
1.18.4.4. Pro: Govt. [banned 328 medicines which may pose a health risk](https://medibulletin.com/here-is-the-complete-list-of-drugs-banned-by-govt-of-india/). India has some 2,000 FDCs \(Fixed Dose Combinations - combination of drugs which poses health hazard\) as against a little over 500 in the US. Moving India towards global standards.
1.18.4.4.1. Con: The ban was done in a manner not following proper process i.e. taking recommendations of DTAB as noted by Supreme Court. Most of the bans was on small companies who will change the composition and brand of the drug as noted by IIFL Pharma analyst. So in totality this is more of a [PR stunt](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/health-ministry-to-ban-328-combination-medicines-over-safety-concerns/articleshow/65777109.cms) that "we as a government care" but in actuality there is no major change on the ground.
1.18.4.5. Pro: For the first time in India's history, the [under-five child mortality rate](https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/first-time-under-five-mortality-rate-same-as-global-average-5363543/) is the same as the global average. With Mission Indradhanush, Mother and Child Tracking System and neonatal ICUs in every district, India has made remarkable progress over the last five years.
1.18.4.5.1. Con: However, as per this source mortality rates for female children are 2.5% higher than male children, when globally mortality rates for girls are lower.
1.18.4.6. Con: -> See 1.9.18.2.
1.18.4.7. Pro: -> See 1.15.5.2.
1.18.5. Con: [Living Wage Family](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/01/21/indians-are-worse-off-under-modi/#2a6a379f203b) in India remains almost flat in the 17300-17400 INR per Month range over his tenure. Meanwhile, wages paid to low-skilled labor decreased to 10300 INR per Month in 2017 from 13300 INR per Month in 2014. As a result, many people's quality of life has suffered during the BJP government.
1.18.6. Con: -> See 1.11.8.1.
1.18.7. Con: -> See 1.1.9.
1.18.8. Pro: Modi is trying to meet Indians' aspirations. Many more people have a gas stove through the [Ujjwala Yojana](https://m.businesstoday.in/story/connecting-the-dots/1/269206.html) a house through the PM Awas Yojana, a bank account through the Jandhan Yojana, pension, life & health insurance through Ayushman Bharat and [many other such policies](https://www.firstpost.com/india/four-years-of-narendra-modi-govt-a-pithy-and-cool-micro-site-tells-and-sells-48-month-success-story-4488435.html). In addition, Modi is working towards the balanced development of [backward districts](https://www.thebetterindia.com/137698/villages-gram-swaraj-abhiyan-modi-antyodaya-ambedkar-april14/).
1.18.8.1. Con: Most of these are [renamed](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bjp-has-merely-renamed-19-out-of-23-congress-schemes-report) government programmes of the previous government simply being sold as Modi's new progammes to rejuvenate our country.
1.18.8.1.1. Con: Many of the programs listed in this source were renamed prior to Modi taking power.
1.18.8.1.2. Con: In addition to renaming programs, the Modi government has also subsumed similar programs together and thus improved their efficiency.
1.18.9. Con: Indians have been forced out of their homes to stand in long ATM queues during [the 2016 demonetisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation) and were limited to take their own white money out of ATMs.
1.18.9.1. Con: One time inconvenience cannot be attributed to quality of life. It happened once in 2016 and and may have extended for a few months. More than a year has passed since then. There is no reporting of such long queues.
1.18.10. Con: The number of [rapes of minors has increased](https://www.thequint.com/voices/opinion/minor-rapes-in-india-data) under Modi’s rule. Many of the BJP officials \([Jayanti Bhanushali](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rape-case-filed-against-gujarat-bjp-leader/article24463799.ece), [Kuldeep Singh Sengar](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/bjp-legislator-kuldeep-singh-sengar-arrested-rape-case-180415012552419.html), [Kanhaiya Lal Mishra](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-arrested-for-allegedly-raping-a-woman-in-varanasi/story-swwOkAHMEUDb3l2HD5GLvL.html) and many more\) have been involved in several of these rapes.
1.18.10.1. Con: Modi has made mandatory death penalty for rapes of minors. If ministers are guilty, they will be punished by the court. As a PM, he has condemned it many times. Now you can see [recent rape cases](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-death-sentence-was-given-within-23-days-of-brutal-rape-murder-of-infant-in-indore/story-INAyddW4AMRXFjTQlumamO.html)[, multiple penalties in MP](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/shivraj-singh-chouhan-mp-high-court-rape-case-pocso-5358379/), [eg.3](http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2018/sep/15/karnataka-district-judge-awards-death-penalty-to-five-in-rape-murder-cases-1872425.html), [eg.4](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-get-death-penalty-for-raping-attempting-to-murder-8-year-old-in-mandsaur/story-kwO43LJgCNbSrBD7ehG5yI.html) are being awarded death penalty within a few months time. This is a significant change from even the recent past, when punishments for similar crimes were weak or non-existent.
1.18.11. Pro: -> See 1.9.16.2.1.
1.19. Pro: Most Indians still support Modi.
1.19.1. Pro: In the upcoming elections too, NDA is expected to win [274 of 543](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/nda-to-get-274-seats-modi-still-first-choice-for-pm-in-mood-of-the-nation-poll-1241678-2018-05-25) Lok Sabha seats as per the prevailing mood of the voters in the country and Modi continues to be the first choice of the voters for prime ministerial role.
1.19.1.1. Con: [One only has to look as far back as 2004](http://www.thehoot.org/research/books/exit-polls-2004-what-went-wrong-and-why-part-i-1158) to realize that simply because surveys reflect a certain trend in favor of X , the outcome may not be in line with that. In fact, surveys showed BJP to win comfortably but it was the Congress that came to power.
1.19.1.2. Con: The linked report actually indicates Modi's popularity is waning.
1.19.2. Con: The BJP has been losing ground in local and state polls since 2014. Case in point they have won only [four out of 23](https://www.indiatvnews.com/elections/news-it-s-8-loss-1-win-since-2014-elections-for-bjp-saffron-party-continues-its-losing-streak-in-lok-sabha-bypolls-except-victory-in-vadodara-432557) Lok Sabha bypolls since 2014.
1.19.2.1. Con: The bypolls in general saw a noticeable drop in voter turnout. [Lower voter turnout amid VVPAT woes](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-bypolls-see-drop-in-voter-turnout-amid-vvpat-woes/articleshow/64364277.cms). Over the past four years precedence shows BJP and NDA winning big whenever voter turnout has been high. In regard to a major election like LS polls, voter turn out is expected to be higher and the NDA gets a benefit of doubt.
1.19.3. Pro: Pulse of the nation, a recent online poll by Times of India, shows [71% of respondents](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/mega-times-group-poll-71-9-of-indians-say-they-will-vote-for-narendra-modi-as-pm-again-in-2019/articleshow/64324490.cms) would vote for Modi again in 2019. This shows that the majority of Indians think Modi is good for India.
1.19.3.1. Con: A sample size of 800,000 cannot represent a population of 1.3 billion. Such surveys are better not taken at face value. This is quite misleading.
1.19.3.2. Con: The survey methodology has not been detailed in the article. It was an online poll, and online polls can be gamed. Given that only [31% of the voting population](https://eci.nic.in/eci_main/archiveofge2014/20%20-%20Performance%20of%20National%20Parties.pdf) voted for Modi in the 2014 elections, it's quite impossible for such a huge percentage change \(more than double\).
1.19.4. Con: Just because Indians support him doesn't mean that Modi has been good for the country as a whole.
1.19.4.1. Pro: People might support Modi because he has been good for them personally rather than the country as a whole.
1.19.4.1.1. Pro: Hindus in India are often treated far better than [Muslims](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/indepth/features/bigotry-normalised-modi-180411100651759.html) under Modi.
1.19.4.2. Con: This is not oen of the valid 'cons' for the claim. The claim that 'Modi may not been good' does not negate the fact that 'Modi is preferred by most of the people. For a valid argument, it must be proven that Modi is not preferred by most of the people.
1.19.4.3. Pro: People could be uninformed or have been tricked into supporting Modi by fake news.
1.19.4.3.1. Pro: Many newspapers in India are highly politicized. Some, such as [The Pioneer](http://hillpost.in/2013/08/top-7-newspapers-known-to-favor-specific-political-parties-in-india/94800/), are openly pro-BJP.
1.19.4.4. Con: Since India is a democracy, the will of the people is the only legitimate indicator of what's good for the country.
1.19.4.4.1. Con: There is no objective way to capture the will of the 1.3 billion people.
1.19.4.4.1.1. Pro: Voting systems capture only which candidate a voter supports, not the extent of their support. If 70% of a population is basically agnostic in a race but supports candidate A, while 30% of the population cares about electing candidate B with great intensity, then the election does not capture the will of the people.
1.19.4.4.1.2. Pro: In multi-party systems, the government is often created through coalition-building after an election. This forces compromise on the platforms of each party in the coalition, and can lead to a party not acting on the promises that led voters to the polls in the first place.
1.19.4.4.1.3. Pro: There is no simple "will of the people". Many people have contradictory political views on different issues, and many more engage in politics for reasons unrelated to policy, such as fear, spite, or coercion. As such, the combination of all these diverse intentions and justifications cannot be combined into one "will".
1.19.5. Pro: Modi government passes no confidence motion test with 325 votes and comes out in flying colourswith a margin of 199 votes. Leaves opposition in the dust with just 126 votes! [googleweblight.com](https://googleweblight.com/i?u=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/live-updates-no-confidence-motion-vote-against-modi-government-in-lok-sabha-today-1290857-2018-07-20&hl=en-IN)  [googleweblight.com](https://googleweblight.com/i?u=https://www.firstpost.com/politics/no-confidence-motion-live-updates-tdp-mps-trope-to-well-shout-slogans-modi-continues-speech-amid-din-4778631.html&hl=en-IN)
1.19.5.1. Con: In a first past the post electoral system, winning the most parliamentary constituencies and/or a vote in parliament does not indicate approval of the majority. In fact, Modi's BJP only received a [31% vote share](https://m.timesofindia.com/news/BJPs-31-lowest-vote-share-of-any-party-to-win-majority/amp_articleshow/35315930.cms#referrer=https://www.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s) in the 2014 election - the lowest of any party to ever win a parliamentary majority.
1.19.5.2. Con: Just because the BJP government has a majority in the house and has won a confidence motion doesn't necessarily mean that people still like or support Modi as much they used to.
1.19.6. Con: The BJP received [31% of the votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_Indian_general_election,_2014) in the 2014 elections. While this was enough to form a majority government, they did not receive the support of the majority of the voting public, and definitely not of the majority of Indians.
1.19.6.1. Con: Modi is preferred by a majority of people is not reflected entirely from the BJP vote share as claimed here. The claim is that Modi remains the most popular leader of India and that is reflected in multiple surveys done recently. On one side there is Modi and on the other side there is fragmented leadership comprising of many leaders. 1.[timesofindia.indiatimes.com](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mega-times-group-poll-71-9-of-indians-say-they-will-vote-for-narendra-modi-as-pm-again-in-2019/articleshow/64324490.cms) 2.[economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-ahead-with-48-votes-in-online-poll-i-pac-survey/articleshow/65662729.cms)
1.20. Con: Modi's policies have been harmful to the environment.
1.20.1. Con: Under Modi's leadership, India has spearheaded the [International Solar Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Solar_Alliance) - a coalition of 121 countries aimed at working toward efficient exploitation of solar energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels - especially in countries that lie between the tropics.
1.20.1.1. Pro: The Alliance has partnered with World Bank to launch the [Global Solar Atlas](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/01/17/new-world-bank-tool-helps-map-solar-potential) - a free online tool that will help governments save millions of dollars on research and provide solar developers with an accessible and uniform platform to compare resource potential between regional or international sites.
1.20.1.2. Pro: Narendra Modi has also been awarded the [United Nations' Champions of the Earth award](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/modi-gets-un-s-highest-environmental-honor-1350019-2018-09-27) 2018 for his work with the International Solar Alliance.
1.20.2. Con: The Modi government has launched [Namami Gange](http://nmcg.nic.in/NamamiGanga.aspx) - a multi million dollar national program to help clean the Ganga.
1.20.2.1. Pro: Even if the success of the program is overstated, it still shows the commitment of the Modi government toward improving India's environment.
1.20.2.2. Con: Data suggests that [only one](http://nmcgpms.nic.in/StatewiseDisplayReport.aspx) out of a total of 28 projects launched after 2014 is near completion in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
1.20.2.3. Con: Most of the [projects sanctioned thus far](http://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/jaitley-said-47-projects-are-done-under-namami-gange-but-not-even-half-are-completed-59618) have been sewerage treatment plants whereas the mandate of Namami Gange was to undertake other tasks such as river surface cleaning, afforestation, industrial effluent monitoring and riverfront development.
1.20.2.4. Con: As of [February 2018](http://nmcg.nic.in/writereaddata/fileupload/44_Namami%20Gange_Patrika_Vol_2_Nov_2017.pdf), only 18 projects had been completed out of 95 sanctioned under Namami Gange. Government representative Arun Jaitley said 45 had been completed in his budget speech showing a clear discrepancy in numbers.
1.20.3. Pro: The coastal developmental policies of Modi have come at the direct expense of India's coastal ecosystems and the native dwellers of these lands. The government has provided massive advantages to industries wanting to gain access in construction, or wanting to ‘develop’ the coastline. But such projects end up ignoring the people in the fishing villages, in addition to nearly a million plus people engaged in fisheries-related activities as well as the natural environment. \[[The Wire](https://thewire.in/environment/modi-government-environment-policy)\].
1.20.4. Pro: Modi's environmental policy has ensured more land can be taken away from tribal forests to appease mining industries. For example, Modi eliminated the requirement for tribes to consent to [forest usage](https://www.inc.in/en/in-focus/the-narendra-modi-govts-war-on-environment).
1.20.5. Pro: Under Modi's environmental policy, more [hydropower](https://thewire.in/environment/modi-government-environment-policy) units can be built on the Ganga, increasing already existing pressure on the fragile ecosystem.
1.20.5.1. Con: While imperfect, India [currently relies on coal and oil for 75% of it's energy,](http://www.gangaaction.org/actions/issues/renewable-energy/) and hydroelectric power is comparatively better for the environment.
1.20.6. Con: Under Modi, India launched the "[Swachh Bharat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swachh_Bharat_Abhiyan)" \(Clean India\) scheme for the first time in its history. This initiative has since gone a long way in cleaning India be it with regards to defecation or throwing garbage on the street.
1.20.6.1. Con: The initiative doesn’t really enforce cleanliness in any manner. More than [50% of the fund](https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/50-of-swachh-bharat-funds-remains-unused/article22699365.ece/amp/) remains unutilized and even if it were utilized 100% it failed to bring about the effect which it promised since the streets remain dirty and there’s more pollution than ever. It’s just another scheme to bring more income into the government with a scapegoat cause to back it.
1.20.7. Con: It was under the leadership of Modi that India formally joined the [Paris Agreement](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/India-joins-Paris-Climate-Change-Agreement-submits-instrument-of-ratification-at-UN-headquarters/articleshow/54643135.cms), which signifies the country's dedication to preventing climate change and reducing its carbon footprint.
1.20.8. Con: India under Shri Modi Ji has started a scheme of distributing LED appliances, viz. bulbs, tube lights, fans, \(at affordable rates\) under the [UJALA scheme](http://www.ujala.gov.in/FAQ).

Also, Recently, Shri Modi Ji launched a scheme of distributing LED bulbs at [Rupees 10 per bulb at Delhi](https://www.firstpost.com/india/pm-modi-launches-rs-10-per-led-bulb-scheme-delhi-2031213.html).
1.20.9. Con: India's [Forest Cover has increased](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-posts-marginal-increase-in-forest-cover-says-report/article22734203.ece), though by a marginal 0.21% rise in the area under forest between 2015 and 2017.
1.20.10. Pro: The Ministry under Nitin Gadkari has shelved the policy on electric vehicles which is a major setback for green transport in India - [Policy revoked!](https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/govt-takes-u-turn-on-ambitious-electric-vehicle-policy-says-nitin-gadkari-118021600039_1.html)
1.20.11. Pro: The Supreme Court [harshly questioned](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/people-not-industries-are-more-important-sc-on-pollution-by-pet-coke-2719921.html) the Centre \(NDA\) on failing to take steps to prevent pollution, saying "People are more important than industries".
1.20.11.1. Con: Failing to prevent pollution by others doesn't mean the Center's policies is harmful to the environment.
1.20.11.1.1. Con: Negligence or inaction in the face of environmental damage and pollution by a government is as great a harm as active acts of pollution, given India's fragile natural environment.
1.20.12. Con: Modi has opened two expressways around [Delhi](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-road-modi/indias-modi-opens-two-expressways-around-delhi-to-reduce-pollution-idUSKCN1IS0F3) to reduce the number of cars, and, subsequently, air pollution, in the city.
1.20.13. Pro: Modi is a [climate change denier](https://youtu.be/yAdfHGAJPh4), which has had a negative impact on the environment.
1.20.13.1. Pro: Climate change denial in and of itself is harmful to the environment. If it doesn't translate into policy, it definitely influences people's decisions and choices, given that it's coming from a head of state in a country that already has problems with education and literacy.
1.20.13.2. Con: Modi is concerned about climate change and is implementing policies to that effect.
1.20.13.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.20.1.
1.20.13.2.2. Pro: At the [World Economic Forum’s annual gathering in Davos in 2018](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/narendra-modi-davos-these-are-the-3-greatest-threats-to-civilization/), Modi stated that climate change is the biggest threat facing the world today. [He said,](https://qz.com/india/1186666/davos-2018-indias-modi-says-climate-change-protectionism-and-terrorism-are-the-worlds-greatest-threats/) “If we are all children of the earth, why is there today a war between us and the earth?”
1.20.13.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.20.1.2.
1.20.13.3. Con: PM Modi, in [Man ki baat](https://youtu.be/6OBvwkf-7ec?t=808), clearly mentions climate change as an issue. In that broadcast, it is obvious that he is acting towards it as well. He declares India as a host for world environment day celebration.
1.20.13.4. Con: [PM Modi in Singapore](https://youtu.be/uFaOAnKsYDA?t=2780) accepted climate change and committed to reducing usage of coal for electricity production.
1.20.14. Pro: Modi's government has extended the deadline within which polluting thermal plants must comply with [pollution regulations](https://www.inc.in/en/in-focus/the-narendra-modi-govts-war-on-environment) by 5 years.
1.20.15. Pro: Modi is abandoning previous [environmental protections](http://america.aljazeera.com/multimedia/2015/4/narendra-modis-war-on-the-indian-environment.html) in favour of economic development.
1.20.16. Con: Modi has made India a [front runner](http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=174832) in solar and wind power to the extent that renewable energies make up 14 percent of total energy generation, thus enabling future Industry growth with low electricity prices.
