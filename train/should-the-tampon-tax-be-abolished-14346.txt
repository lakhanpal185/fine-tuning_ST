Discussion Title: Should the Tampon Tax be Abolished?

1. The tampon tax should be abolished.
1.1. Con: Tampons should be taxed in a manner consistent with taxes on toilet paper, toothpaste, soap, dental floss, and other products necessary for basic hygiene.
1.1.1. Pro: Sanitary products are, as the name suggests, more for sanitary use than urgent medical use.
1.1.1.1. Con: Urgency is not a litmus test for taxation. A review of [VAT schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax) worldwide and [sales tax in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_taxes_in_the_United_States) will show no jurisdiction that taxes health-related materials differently based on immediacy of need.
1.1.1.2. Pro: There is no evidence to suggest that there are medical consequences to free bleeding.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Social censure, such as that which women might experience as a result of free bleeding, can cause mental health issues.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: [75% of women](https://www.womenshealth.gov/menstrual-cycle/premenstrual-syndrome) experience premenstrual syndrome in their life, which includes symptoms like [anxiety](https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/causes/pms) and [depression.](https://www.webmd.com/women/pms/depression-pms) Social stigma from free bleeding could exacerbate that.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Bodily fluids are considered a health and safety hazard. Free bleeding is no different from urinating or defecating into your underwear and is equally repulsive.
1.1.1.3. Con: It is effectively impossible to carry out normal daily activities without tampons, or another sanitary product, because of the risk of blood leaking onto clothes and other surfaces and the discomfort that causes.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: Adherents of the [Free Bleeding movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Bleeding_Movement) advocate for a less shame-filled approach to menstruation.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: This movement is inaccessible to the many women who feel intimidated by the existing social stigma and censure surrounding periods.
1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The only way to combat this social stigma is by challenging it, as the Free Bleeding Movement are doing.
1.1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Many women opt to go without their normal daily activities rather than risk publicly bleeding.
1.1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Among female Bangladeshi factory workers, [60%](https://www.sswm.info/humanitarian-crises/camps/hygiene-promotion-community-mobilisation/hygiene-promotion-community/menstrual-hygiene-management) use rags from the factory floor for menstrual cloths, resulting in infections that cause 73% of women to miss work for six days a month, on average.
1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: Some girls miss school while on their period because they cannot afford sanitary products such as tampons.
1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Many girls in the UK miss [several days](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-5199703/UK-children-missing-school-period-poverty--campaigners-say.html) of school a month due to not being able to afford sanitary products.
1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: In Uganda, girls miss up to eight days of school a month due to [period poverty](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/getting-girls-in-school-period/), while in Kenya, girls miss an average of 4.9 days a month.
1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: In rural India, [one in five](http://www.newsweek.com/2016/04/29/womens-periods-menstruation-tampons-pads-449833.html) girls drop out of school after they start menstruating, and only 12% of menstruating women use sanitary napkins.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Women likely wouldn't be allowed partake in some activities, such as swimming in communal pools, while free-bleeding, for hygiene reasons.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: There is no physical check to see if a person in a public pool might be on their period, and whether they are using a tampon or menstrual cup. Unless they are bleeding heavily and visibly, there is no way to tell for outsiders.
1.1.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Blood is unlikely to be [visible](https://helloclue.com/articles/cycle-a-z/can-you-swim-on-your-period) when it is diluted in a large body of water.
1.1.1.3.1.2.2. Con: Pools often contain small amounts of other bodily fluids, such as urine and sweat, but the chlorine with which the water is treated prevents the spread of disease. This is no different with menstrual blood.
1.1.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: Even if there are no actual hygiene risks to swimming while free-bleeding, other users of the pool would likely view it as a hygiene risk, because of society's view of menstruation, and might complain to management or shame the woman.
1.1.1.3.1.2.4. Pro: Historically, mesntruation has been considered [unclean](https://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/leviticus/passage/?q=leviticus+15:19-33) and women menstruating have been prevented from taking part in certain activities due to it.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Current social norms regarding cleanliness usually mean that being dirty or unclean is something people aim to avoid; this stands true for people who want to avoid wearing bloody and stained clothes throughout the day.
1.1.1.3.3. Pro: Women run the risk of being publicly shamed, through looks given to them or words said to or about them, if they noticeably bleed onto surfaces or through their clothes.
1.1.1.3.4. Pro: Many women fear that period blood would irreversibly stain their clothing.
1.1.1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.2.
1.1.2. Con: Everyone uses toilet paper, toothpaste, soap, etc. Only women use tampons. Taxing tampons is a tax on women.
1.1.2.1. Con: Sales and use taxes are not based on who will consume a good, but rather on the class of a goods. Suggesting a consumer based tax would result in inequitable tax treatment.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Every tax is a tax on consumers.   If we start adding exceptions based on the likely gender of the user, we might soon be exempting hundreds of products based on gender, race, age, etc.
1.1.2.2. Con: It is not true that only women are allowed to pay for tampons. Sometimes men purchase tampons for their partner. or for other uses.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Not all women have male partners.
1.1.2.3. Con: Men use razors and shaving products at a higher cost and frequency than women use tampons, especially if their job requires a clean shave.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Shaving and antiperspirants are a basic necessity, since hair growth and sweating are biological functions.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: In certain situations, not having a clean shave would not be as big problem as not having tampons. Not having tampons can prevent you from doing your job.
1.1.2.4. Con: Just because something is only sought after by a fraction of the market doesn’t mean that it is oppression. Not all want to eat meat, does that mean that meat eaters are oppressed? We can't make everything tax-free. This very notion is antagonistic to the social development of nations.
1.1.3. Pro: Exceptions make laws more complex.
1.1.3.1. Con: Complex laws aim for better accuracy and fairness in addressing real-life situations, as opposed to batch-processing diverse and nuanced issues.
1.1.4. Pro: Taxes go to the state to help fund things like public education and healthcare. Taxing tampons in a similar way to other hygiene products means more tax income to fund these things.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The California state government [predicted](http://file:///C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/201520160AB1561_Assembly%20Floor%20Analysis_.pdf) that removing the tampon tax would result in an annual loss of $20 million.
1.1.4.2. Pro: The elders in one Eskimo village, shamans of traditional wisdom, have stated for years that the bears can sense menstrual bleeding. This will send a bear into a violent frenzy and the bear will damage any structures around them.  The tax is needed to pay for this damage done. [nps.gov](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/grizzlybear-menstrual-odor.htm)
1.2. Con: It is more important for the state to have enough income from taxes to finance social benefits. The tampon tax shouldn't be abolished but decreased.
1.2.1. Con: Women make up [less than half](https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.welfare.ie/en/downloads/2011stats.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj6s863oZzbAhWC6qQKHcKrDDYQFjABegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw2xjozegT1qChjB1tpiadAD) of social welfare receipients, making it unfair for women to pay an extra amount of tax to the state.
1.2.2. Pro: A broad tax base can provide government funded services that benefit women, such as subsidised healthcare.
1.2.2.1. Con: These services are generally available to all members of society, and it is unfair to make one gender fund them more than any other.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Studies have shown that women avail of [healthcare more than](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10718692/) other genders.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Men have the option of availing of these healthcare services.Women should not be penalised for taking better care of their health, nor for requiring services more often for biological factors outside of their control.
1.2.3. Con: If it is more important for the state to have enough income from taxes to finance social benefits, then it is illogical that tampon tax should also be decreased. If the tampon tax is high enough to warrant being decreased, regardless of the impact that would have on financing social benefits, then, arguably, the financing of social benefits is not, in practice, as important.
1.2.4. Con: The tampon tax is an unfair way to raise tax to finance social benefits. All women, regardless of their income, pay the [same amount of tax](http://www.dailylife.com.au/news-and-views/dl-opinion/why-the-tampon-tax-debate-is-important--and-its-not-just-about-gst-20150529-ghd0s9.html) per tampon. Thus, women from lower income backgrounds are hit harder by the tax
1.2.5. Con: Canada [abolished](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tampon-tax-scrapped-in-canada-after-petition-convinces-conservative-government-10283929.html) the tampon tax and is still able to fund social benefits.
1.3. Con: Just because something is gender specific shouldn't mean it should not be treated just like the other things that both sexes need.
1.3.1. Con: Taxes on gender specific items put a specific financial pressure on one gender when all genders benefit from what the government subsidises with these taxes.
1.3.1.1. Con: Both sexes do not benefit equally from government expenditure. Women receive more funds for [health care](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2594716), are the vast [majority of single parents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_parent#United_States_single_mothers) \(receiving social spending benefits\) and outnumber men at [every level](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-ostapchuk/breakdown-of-us-high-scho_b_9265724.html) of [education](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/06/womens-college-enrollment-gains-leave-men-behind/).
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Women do not choose to be the ones who give birth to children, nor do women choose to be the primary caretakers of children. Biology and society dictate those things.
1.3.2. Con: It isn't an issue of gender specific items being taxed, it's an issue of women-specific products being taxed.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Tampons are taxed in many states in the US while [Viagra is not.](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/22/ashley-judd/are-pads-and-tampons-taxed-viagra-and-rogaine-not/)
1.3.2.2. Pro: Women already pay more for products than men.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The [pink tax](https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/the-pink-tax/) is a phenomenon where products targeted at women cost, on average, 42% more than similar products targeted at men.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Women's razors tend to [cost more](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.thestreet.com/amp/story/14519268/1/the-pink-tax-means-that-products-geared-to-females-cost-more.html) than men's.
1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: If you are aware of the pink tax but refuse to buy identical men's products, you are allowing yourself to be affected by [internalized sexism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalized_sexism)
1.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: While originally understood as just affecting "luxury" items, the pink tax affects [basic necessities](http://time.com/4159973/women-pay-more-everything/) too.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: A business will charge whatever they are able to charge. If women end up paying slightly more for, say, shampoo this usually correlate with the quality of the product. If not, we have the same hair so simply buy the one marketed towards men.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: Women cannot opt for buying products made for men when it comes to sanitary products, which are exclusively made for women.
1.3.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Many other products, like makeup and women's clothing, are also exclusively for women, and while they may not be "necessities," they are part of society's expectations for how a woman should look.
1.3.2.2.2.2. Con: While women might be able to buy some male versions of products to save money, it's fundamentally unfair that they are put in a position where they have to do this.
1.3.2.2.2.2.1. Con: There is nothing unfair about buying a product marketed towards men when both sexes can use it.
1.3.2.2.3. Con: This isn't officially sanctioned or enshrined in law. Regulating the perceived injustice of different people buying the products they want to buy by unilaterally giving money to women is shortsighted and irresponsible.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Con: While the pink tax isn't enshrined in law, it still [exists](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/03/29/pink-tax-women-pay-more/417648002/). The tampon tax just exacerbates this already unequal aspect of the economy.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Con: Eradicating excessive taxes on women's products does not involve giving money to women. It merely means not overcharging them for those products.
1.3.2.2.3.3. Con: For most women, buying tampons is a case of "need" rather than "want".
1.3.2.2.3.3.1. Pro: Tampons are a basic necessity, since menstruation is a biological function.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: In many jurisdictions, groceries and basic necessities are not taxed. In these jurisdictions, tampons should not be taxed.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Leaving necessities exempt from VAT should be a consistent principle unaffected by gender.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.1.2. Con: Most tax systems have varying rates ranging from exemption due to necessity to luxury good rates, with tampons being deemed by the state as non-essential in a large number of cases.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.1.2.1. Con: The fact that many states do classify tampons as non-essential is not necessarily reason in itself to believe that they are non-essential.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: Access to menstrual hygiene is a [human rights issue](https://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2068&context=lawfaculty), as it is linked to the rights of health, sanitation, education, and work.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: The total amount spent on tampons in the U.S. in 2015 was [$3.1 billion](http://www.newsweek.com/2016/04/29/womens-periods-menstruation-tampons-pads-449833.html). The federal budget was [$3.8 trillion](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/). The government could easily afford to make tampons free for every woman, thus ensuring that women's rights are guaranteed.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.2.2. Pro: [Toxic shock syndrome](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/) can be caused by women using tampons for longer than recommended. It is a life threatening condition. The tampon tax increases the costs of tampons and may contribute towards women placing themselves at risk of the condition.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.3. Con: While sanitary products, in general, are basic necessities, tampons themselves are just one available option.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.3.1. Con: In the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rates-of-vat-on-different-goods-and-services#health-education-welfare-and-charities), sanitary products as a whole are taxed, not just tampons.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.5. Con: It is incorrect to state that tampons are a "basic necessity." Many women are able to cope with menstruation by using tampon alternatives, or by using no products at all.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.6. Pro: All sales taxes should be abolished. They are by nature regressive. A poor woman pays a much higher portion of her income for basic necessities than a rich woman. Only income should be taxed.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.6.1. Con: VAT taxes consider how much people consume. People who invest in themselves shouldn't pay the same taxes as people who don't. This is especially true for poor people when they try to make themselves wealthier.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.8. Con: Food is also a basic necessity but many foods are taxed in various jurisdictions.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.8.1. Pro: Clothes, water, and shelter are also basic necessities, but are also often taxed.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.8.1.1. Pro: More than [20 countries](https://www.vatlive.com/vat-rates/international-vat-and-gst-rates/) have a VAT on water, which is necessary for daily life. It is not illegitimate to tax, as the government has to bear the financial burden of purifying and pumping the water.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.8.1.1.1. Con: Tampons are a privately produced good, meaning that the government has no burden in regards to supplying/producing them.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.8.1.2. Con: It is factually true that clothes, water and shelter, are often subject to taxation. However, it does not follow from this that because these items are taxed, tampons should also be taxed.  It is morally incorrect that any item which is a basic necessity is taxed.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.8.2. Con: In [most instances](http:///guidance/rates-of-vat-on-different-goods-and-services#food-and-drink-animals-animal-feed-plants-and-seeds), the only types of food that are taxed are junk foods and processed foods, and there are affordable alternatives to purchasing those, e.g. one can purchase untaxed produce instead. Most women have no easily affordable alternative to purchasing tampons.
1.3.2.2.3.3.1.8.2.1. Pro: Britain, who currently have a 5% VAT rate on tampons, implements a [0%](http://www.marcusward.co/some-odd-vat-facts/) VAT rate on caviar.
1.3.2.2.3.4. Con: Women being disproportionately charged for products simply on the basis of them being products for women is not merely perceived injustice but rather actual injustice.
1.4. Pro: Taxation is theft, therefore, all taxes should be abolished, not just this one.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.4.2. Con: Private property is theft, therefore we should abolish private ownership.
1.4.3. Con: The fact that tax is theft is arguable when the population are free to migrate.
1.5. Pro: Removing the tampon tax would aid gender economic equality.
1.5.1. Con: Men have to pay for shaving cream and razors as much as women have to pay for tampons. For the sake of gender equality, taxes should be removed on these products as well.
1.5.1.1. Con: Razor blades and shaving cream are not [male-only](https://www.vox.com/2015/5/22/8640457/leg-shaving-history) products.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.1.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.5.1.2. Con: Shaving materials are not necessities in the same way that sanitary products are.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: While the vast majority of people with a uterus will go through menstruation in their life and need sanitary products, shaving is an aesthetic choice for most people.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.3.1.
1.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.5.1.4. Con: It's better that both are taxed. Arbitrarily removing taxes for X, Y or Z equality is dangerous. In the end there won't be any taxes left.
1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.5.3. Con: The tampon tax can improve gender equality. For example, tax revenue from the tampon tax could be earmarked specifically for [women's charities.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/autumn-statement-george-osborne-says-tampon-tax-will-fund-womens-charities-a6748241.html)
1.5.3.1. Con: Women's charities are the collective responsibility of society. Women should not have to pay the tampon tax in order to fund women's charities.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: The funding for men's charities does not come from the taxation of essential products for men.
1.5.3.2. Pro: The only legitimate way to tax a specific group for belonging to said group is to ensure that they are the ones that benefit from the tax.
1.5.3.3. Con: In the UK, [£250,000](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/28/anti-abortion-life-charity-will-get--tampon-tax-funds) of tampon tax money went directly to the Life Institute, which, while technically classed as a women's charity, advocates against women's reproductive rights, and thus, arguably acts against many women's interests.
1.5.3.4. Pro: If tampons are taxed, the money obtained from the tax can be used to provide free tampons to those who otherwise could not afford them.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: The tampon tax is affordable for most women in developed countries. Rather than abolishing the tax altogether, the government should subsidize tampons for low-income women.
1.5.3.4.1.1. Con: People are already reluctant to support [food stamps](https://www.ilnews.org/news/statewide/poll-shows-broad-support-for-attaching-work-requirements-to-food/article_35f73b96-427a-11e8-9262-33e6e5a81284.html) for poorer people. It is even less likely that political will exists to subsidise hygiene products.
1.5.3.4.1.1.1. Con: In the U.S., the food stamp program cost [$73.9 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program#/media/File:SNAP_Benefits_Paid_2005-2012.png) in 2015 and supplied roughly [45.8 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program#/media/File:SNAP_Program_Participants.png) Americans with food. By contrast, all tampon sales in the US were only [$3.1 billion](http://www.newsweek.com/2016/04/29/womens-periods-menstruation-tampons-pads-449833.html) in 2015 and impacted nearly the entire female population of menstruating age.
1.5.3.5. Pro: In the United Kingdom, the tampon tax raises [15 million pounds](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/women-and-girls-set-to-benefit-from-15-million-tampon-tax-fund) a year. This is spent exclusively on women's charities.
1.5.3.6. Con: In the UK, over[£2.5 million](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/women-and-girls-set-to-benefit-from-15-million-tampon-tax-fund) generated from the tampon tax went to domestic abuse organizations. This is essentially making women pay for their own protection from abusive men.
1.5.4. Pro: Women are already suffering from the [gender wage gap.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap)
1.5.4.1. Pro: A 2016 study claims that the median woman earns [79 cents](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/08/its-2016-and-women-still-make-less-for-doing-the-same-work-as-men/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.dcfbb1f6f13e) for every dollar paid to the median man.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Women spend 3x the amount of time as men on unpaid care work, an economic contribution worth [$10 trillion](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Global%20Themes/Women%20matter/Miles%20to%20go%20Stepping%20up%20progress%20toward%20gender%20equality/Miles-to-go-Stepping-up.ashx).
1.5.4.3. Pro: Women are paid less than men. Then their income is subjected to additional taxation, via the tampon tax. This contributes towards women having less disposable income than men. This is unjust.
1.5.4.4. Con: Women tend to focus less on their careers, and take more time off work. They are also, on average, less guided by future earnings when choosing a field of study or work. In aggregate, this means that women make slightly less money. There are plenty of highly successful women that disprove the notion that this disparity is solely down to structural discrimination.
[Women working less](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/pdf/women_workforce_slides.pdf)
1.5.4.5. Con: The gender wage gap does not affect women on minimum wage, which are the women of low income most affected by the tampon tax.
1.5.4.5.1. Con: In [Australia](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/12/the-gender-pay-gap-stretches-to-minimum-wage-workers-too) "women on a minimum wage earn roughly 10% less per hour than men on the minimum rate."
1.5.4.5.1.1. Pro: Minimum wages are [lower](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/12/the-gender-pay-gap-stretches-to-minimum-wage-workers-too) for jobs more commonly held by low skilled women, such as health care workers, as opposed to jobs more commonly held by low skilled men, such as road transportation.
1.5.4.5.2. Con: In the U.S. in 2016, there were [952,000](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2016/home.htm) women earning below the minimum wage, as opposed to 499,000 men.
1.5.5. Pro: Abolishing the tampon tax, for reasons related to gender equality, sends a message to society that periods are not something that women should be embarrassed about.
1.5.5.1. Pro: The charity Plan International UK produced a [report](https://plan-uk.org/media-centre/plan-international-uks-research-on-period-poverty-and-stigma) about the stigma surrounding periods. It revealed that 48% of girls aged 14-21 were embarrassed to talk about their periods. Abolishing the tampon tax would help to counter this stigma.
1.5.6. Con: As it targets one gender \(women\) it is inequitable by nature.
1.6. Pro: Tampons are legally classed as a medical device and therefore should be treated as such in the tax code and be rendered non taxable.
1.6.1. Con: Medical equipment in [Ireland](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-rates/search-vat-rates/M/medical-equipment.aspx) is currently taxed at the country's standard rate of 23%.
1.6.1.1. Con: Ireland is the only country within the EU to not have the [tampon tax](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-08-15/tampon-tax-real-women-everywhere-pay-their-governments-extra-have-periods). Given that it is an anomaly within the EU in this regard in itself, its taxation of medical devices, which is also unusual within Europe, should not be viewed as typical of the general taxation customs within the EU.
1.6.2. Pro: In the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/rates-of-vat-on-different-goods-and-services#health-education-welfare-and-charities), tampons and sanitary protection products are the only health items subject to any VAT.
1.6.2.1. Con: In the UK, the tampon tax has already been [reduced to 5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampon_tax#United_Kingdom), which is the [lowest tax the EU allows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_value_added_tax) and Tesco has [already started to pay](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/28/tesco-absorbs-tampon-tax-5-per-cent-vat-sanitary-products) the extra 5% which means that women are at most only barely affected by the extra cost. This makes many women completely unaffected if they already visit Tesco regularly, or mildly inconvenienced if they don't.
1.6.3. Con: Classifying tampons as a medical device is regrettable. It implies that menstruation is an exceptional event, a kind of "illness" that needs to be "medically cured."
1.6.3.1. Con: Gauze can also be classified as a medical device, does not imply an exceptional event or illness, but is employed against bleeding which benefits from medical attention. Therefore it is not "regrettable" that tampons are considered medical products, because the claim that such classification defines menstruation as an "exceptional event" is spurious.
1.7. Con: This is a personal expense by any definition under fiscal law. Accordingly, there is no basis for the Government to exempt from- or reimburse for- taxation.
1.8. Pro: Abolishing the tampon tax would help those low-income women that cannot afford menstruation supplies.
1.8.1. Con: A solution might be a voucher system for low-income women in order for them to redeem a tax-exception when buying tampons, which can be financed with the tampon tax from the citizen whom are wealthy enough to be able to pay the full price for those items.
1.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.4.1.1.
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.5.3.4.1.
1.8.3. Con: The tax shouldn't be abolished for women who can afford it.
1.8.4. Con: It is the cost of tampons themselves that are expensive; the tampon tax does not significantly affect the price.
1.8.4.1. Pro: It is not the tax on tampons that makes tampons expensive. It's the basic price. A price that is affordable to most women. Women who cannot afford tampons should just be given them for free at aid stations or given state-sponsored stamps to get them at the supermarket. The same should be true for other hygiene products.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: Free tampon dispensers have been a thing for a long time at many schools and universities. With a dispenser, even the feeling of awkwardness shouldn't be a problem.
1.8.4.2. Pro: The tampon tax is 5% in the [UK](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-42013239) and 10% in [Australia](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/29/labor-vows-to-axe-discriminatory-tampon-tax-if-it-wins-federal-election).
1.8.4.3. Con: A 5% or 10% price increase could be the difference between being able to afford or not being able to afford a box of tampons for many women.
1.8.4.3.1. Con: A 5-10% increase usually doesn't make any difference at all. If you have a well-paid job, you'll easily afford tampons and other hygiene products.
If you are on welfare, in most countries, too.
If you have no income at all - 5-10% doesn't make a difference. You can't afford the product. 
There are aid stations and "women houses" at least in European countries that will give you tampons - and other aid - for free.
1.8.4.3.1.1. Con: For those on a limited budget, even a small difference of 5-10% could mean they have to choose between sanitary products or food for their family.
1.8.4.3.1.2. Pro: A typical woman menstruates for about 38 years of her life. That's 452 periods. A box of 36 tampons in the US costs $7. According to this [article](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/18/period-cost-lifetime_n_7258780.html), a woman spends about $1773 on tampons in her life. That's $46.65 per year or $3.88 per month.
5% tax on $3.88 is a monthly sales tax cost of $0.19. Or $2.33 per year. Or $88.46 in 38 years.
Even at 10% taxes this is not a high amount at all and will save exactly no-one.
1.8.4.3.2. Pro: The tampon tax is a [regressive tax](https://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/fiscal-policy/regressive-tax/), meaning it takes a higher percentage of a poor woman's income than of a wealthier woman's income.
1.8.4.3.2.1. Con: According to the US  internal revenue service, a regressive tax is, “A tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups.” That is, a tax that causes lower-income groups to pay a greater proportion of their income than higher-income groups pay.  Since all sales taxs are applied at a flat rate to all consumers regardless of their income level, by definition, all sales and use taxes are regressive.[apps.irs.gov](https://apps.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/student/glossary.jsp#regressiveta)  [apps.irs.gov](https://apps.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/teacher/whys_thm03_les02.jsp)
1.8.5. Pro: This economically punishes poor women specifically for being women.
1.8.5.1. Pro: [Homeless women](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_uk/article/xd5jy4/for-homeless-women-having-a-period-isnt-just-a-hassle-its-a-nightmare-124) often have to resort to stealing sanitary products due to how expensive they are.
1.8.5.2. Pro: [One in ten](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/28/we-dont-know-enough-about-menstruation-and-girls-are-paying-a-price) 15 year-olds in Kenya said that they had had sex in order to get money to pay for sanitary pads.
1.8.5.3. Pro: Lower-income boys do not face [missing school](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-5199703/UK-children-missing-school-period-poverty--campaigners-say.html) due to costs specifically associated with their gender.
1.8.6. Pro: [Period poverty](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/12/period-poverty-call-to-tackle-the-hidden-side-of-inequality) is becoming increasingly common.
1.8.6.1. Con: Eliminating the tampon tax will not significantly reduce the cost of tampons. Thus, the only way to end period poverty is to ensure that tampons are available free of charge to all women.
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: If the tampon tax is abolished, women will still have to pay for tampons. 

Thus, campaigning to end the tampon tax, rather than campaigning to ensure that tampons are available free of charge, is morally wrong, because it contributes towards normalizing the problematic notion that women should pay for tampons.
1.8.6.1.1.1. Con: 320 million people in the US \(2017\), 160m are women, who will average 500 periods. That's 80 billion. Assuming 20 tampons/cycle, this is 1.6 trillion tampons. [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/browse/personal-care/tampons/1005862_1091866_1224834) price of a single tampon ranges 12c-22c. Average is 18c. Giving out free tampons at this price would cost almost $90b over their lifetimes; $180m a year. This climbs when you factor population growth and inflation. Not expensive on a national scale but who will pay for it, and what groups will demand similar benefits?
1.8.6.2. Pro: A report by the group 'Women for Independence' revealed that [1 in 5 women](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/05/period-poverty-scotland-poll-shows-women-go-to-desperate-lengths) have experienced period poverty at some point in their lives.
1.8.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.
1.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.3.2.
1.9. Con: Women could use cheaper options, such as the reusable menstrual cups or [moon pads.](https://www.newmoonpads.com)
1.9.1. Con: While cheaper in the long run, menstrual cups require a much larger initial payment which many women cannot afford.
1.9.1.1. Con: A menstrual cup can cost as little as [£7.99](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B016UBWBFO/ref=mp_s_a_1_6_a_it/260-9313679-1042804?ie=UTF8&qid=1526411311&sr=8-6&keywords=menstrual+cup&dpPl=1&dpID=413qsV7lU-L&ref=plSrch). That is approximately the cost of [two boxes of tampons](https://www.expatistan.com/price/tampax/london) which wouldn't last as long as the menstrual cup.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: The [minimum wage](http://www.minimum-wage.co.uk/) in Britain \(for those over the age of 25\) is £7.83 an hour. Many women can't afford to spend more than an hour's worth of wages on a menstrual cup, even if it is cheaper in the long run.
1.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: This problem is [exacerbated](http://www.minimum-wage.co.uk/) for women between the ages of 21 and 24, 18 and 20, 16 and 18, and those in apprenticeships, who earn £7.38, £5.90, £4.20, and £3.70 an hour, respectively.
1.9.1.2. Pro: As menstrual cups are not nearly as commonly found in stores as tampons, many women have to buy them online, meaning they often have to pay additional shipping charges, as well as paying for the cup itself.
1.9.2. Con: These items are also taxed as non-essential items.
1.9.2.1. Con: Despite the tax, these alternatives are still cheaper than tampons and are a viable option for poorer women.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: Regardless of the fact that they are cheaper alternatives, women still have to pay more for them than they necessarily should.
1.9.2.2. Pro: Pointing out that there are alternatives which may be cheaper misses the underlying question of a tampon tax. The entire category of products are taxing a protected class of citizens unfairly.
1.9.3. Pro: It is cheaper in the long run to buy a menstrual cup as they do not have to be bought monthly, like tampons.
1.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.1.
1.9.3.2. Pro: Most menstrual cups can be used for at least a year.
1.9.3.3. Con: -> See 1.9.1.2.
1.9.4. Pro: Tampons and other non-reusable menstrual products are bad for the environment.
1.9.4.1. Con: Menstrual cups could have a negative environmental impact.
1.9.4.1.1. Con: Women should not be forced to make their own sanitary products due to their socio-economic status.
1.9.4.1.1.1. Con: If the homemade tampons function the same as store-bought tampons, and are of similar comfort levels, then there is no actual difference in terms of the dignity of using either.
1.9.4.1.2. Con: The average woman will use approximately [9120 tampons](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7258780?guccounter=1) in their lifetime; making and washing enough reusable tampons to last that many uses that is an impractical amount of labour.
1.9.4.1.3. Con: Reusable tampons are [difficult to sterilise](https://www.drsherry.com/blog/the-real-deal-with-reusable-feminine-hygiene-products/) and can be unsafe due to that.
1.9.4.1.3.1. Pro: Water can sterilise at [80 degrees Celsius](https://www.morebeer.com/articles/sanitizingmethods) while hot water in washing machines generally gets as high as [54.4 degrees Celsius](http://www.thespruce.com/laundry-and-water-temperature-1900646). This leaves washed reusuable tampons at risk of not being as sterilised as needed.
1.9.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Reusable tampons can be hand-washed, using boiled water from a kettle or stove.
1.9.4.1.3.1.1.1. Con: As many as [140,000 poorer households](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/business-43827846) in Britain don't have access to power, which would be necessary to access boiling water for washing purposes.
1.9.4.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Doesn't their electricity need outweigh their need for tampons? According to the referenced source; the poorer households goes without 1\) electricity and 2\) food. Both of which are higher priority targets of subsidized welfare than tax-free tampons
1.9.4.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.1.3.1.1.1.
1.9.4.1.4. Con: Many poorer women use Laundromats because they do not own a washing machine in their own home. They likely would not be able to afford to wash their reusable sanitary products every day of their period.
1.9.4.2. Pro: A high tax on products that damage the environment, such as tampons, will deter consumers from making choices that are bad for the environment.
1.9.4.3. Pro: Tampons require [3 times](https://lunapads.com/pages/environment) as much energy to manufacture than traditional reusable cloth based solutions to menstruation.
1.9.4.4. Pro: Harmful [insecticides](http://www.pan-uk.org/cotton/) are used during the production of cotton that is used in tampons.
1.9.4.5. Pro: Tampons should slowly be eliminated and replaced with reusable products to help fight against the plastic/waste crisis.
1.9.4.5.1. Pro: Tampons and tampon applicators frequently end up on beaches, and cause [harm](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/flushing-tampons-toilet-blocks-drains-sanitary-products) to birds and fish that consume them.
1.9.4.5.1.1. Pro: A report by the Center for Marine Conservation demonstrated that between 1998 and 1999,  more than [170,000 tampon applicators](https://wemoon.com.au/environmental-choice/) were collected from US coastal areas.
1.9.4.5.2. Pro: More than [45 billion](https://changetogreen.co.nz/pages/facts) tampons or sanitary pads are thrown away every year. Tampons take 500 years to decompose.
1.9.5. Pro: Women in many countries don't use tampons for cultural reasons.
1.9.5.1. Pro: In [China](http://www.uschina.usc.edu/w_usct/showarticle.aspx?articleID=20512&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1), 89% of the female hygiene market is pads. Only 8.2 million women use tampons in China, out of a female population of over 660 million.
1.9.5.2. Con: Many cultures' aversions to tampons stem from myths about their effect on a woman's virginity.
1.9.5.2.1. Pro: This is a common enough concern that some tampon companies address that question [on their websites.](https://www.ubykotex.com/en-ca/periods/pads-and-tampons/will-i-still-be-a-virgin-if-i-use-a-tampon)
1.9.5.3. Pro: Some Muslim women opt [to not use](https://thetempest.co/2017/09/05/life-love/muslim-women-tampons/) tampons.
1.9.6. Con: Some women find the menstrual cup uncomfortable.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Women shouldn't have to be uncomfortable for approximately [60 days a year](https://www.menstrupedia.com/articles/physiology/menstruation-last) in physical discomfort for financial reasons.
1.9.7. Con: Menstrual cups require boiling to stay clean and safe to use. Many women don't have access to facilities to allow this level of care for a cup.
1.9.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.1.3.1.1.1.
1.9.8. Con: The existence of cheaper alternatives does not change the fact that it is principally illegitimate to tax a luxury rate for a good that is necessary for daily life.
1.9.8.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.3.1.8.1.1.
1.9.9. Pro: [Period panties](https://menstrualcupreviews.net/best-period-panties-reviews/) are a type of underwear that absorbs blood.
1.9.9.1. Con: Period panties still need tampons or similar to be used.
1.9.9.2. Pro: As period panties are reusable, they work out cheaper in the long run.
1.9.9.2.1. Con: A cheap pair of period panties costs approximately [€15](https://www.shethinx.com). Most people would require more than one pair during their period, making period panties inaccessible to poorer women.
1.9.9.3. Con: Poor women likely wouldn't be able to afford multiple pairs to last throughout their periods, and might not be able to afford the cost of washing their only pair daily.
1.9.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.1.4.
1.10. Pro: Tampons were classed as "luxury items" by patriarchal governments with little to no consultation of women.
1.10.1. Pro: People [generally misunderstand](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/maria-shriver/he-said-she-heard-how-genders-misunderstand-each-other-n250816) the opposite gender.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Even in the information age, men still have [many](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.teenvogue.com/story/common-questions-guys-have-about-periods-answered/amp) [misconceptions](https://www.healthyway.com/content/real-misconceptions-that-men-have-had-about-menstruation/) [about](https://m.mic.com/articles/amp/103288/the-7-most-common-myths-about-periods-debunked) menstruation. This feeds into the narrative classifying tampons as a luxury item.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: This is because of a lack of proper sex education in schools. Men have to know about menstruation just as much as women do.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.
1.10.3. Pro: In the UK, Viagra was [exempt from VAT](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-notice-70157-health-professionals-and-pharmaceutical-products/vat-notice-70157-health-professionals-and-pharmaceutical-products#medical-services-provided-by-registered-health-professionals), and that only changed in [2017](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-reclassifies-viagra-connect-tablets-to-a-pharmacy-medicine) when it became available to purchase without a prescription.
1.10.4. Pro: Men do not have periods. Men will never have to pay the tampon tax. The tampon tax is sexist because it discriminates against women for having periods.
1.10.5. Con: Some of the most gender-equal countries in the world, like Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, tax tampons at [25%](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-08-15/tampon-tax-real-women-everywhere-pay-their-governments-extra-have-periods).
1.10.6. Pro: This government believes that super yachts are not a luxury & should not have a Goods and Services Tax \(GST\). Given this argument, it is pretty well impossible to sustain a case for a GST on any item, least of all gender specific sanitary products. We can only judge what is a luxury in relative terms & if a yacht is not a luxury item, it cannot be fairly argued that a tampon is. [www.ato.gov.au](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/GST/In-detail/Rules-for-specific-transactions/International-transactions/GST-free-sales-and-purchases-of-new-recreational-boats/) [www.abc.net.au](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-15/tax-change-massive-potential-to-australia-superyacht-industry/8872958) This fact demolishes all contrary arguments presented thus far.
1.10.7. Pro: As recently as 2015, MPs tried to have a discussion on the tampon tax without [saying the word "tampon".](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/10/27/stella-creasy-tampon-tax-bill-cash_n_8396726.html) This shows a fundamental disconnect between the mostly-male government and their understanding of tampons' necessity.
1.10.8. Con: The UK government, which is [predominantly male](http://www.ukpolitical.info/female-members-of-parliament.htm), made plans to [repeal](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tampon-tax-david-cameron-announces-end-to-vat-on-sanitary-products-in-house-of-commons-a6944371.html) the tampon tax.
1.10.8.1. Con: Modern politicians wanting to repeal the tampon tax does not mean that the politicians who put the tax in place made it with women's needs in mind.
1.10.8.2. Con: "Government made plans to" is different from "Government did". Plans presented by parliaments not always turn into legislation, and sometimes are only presented to calm down the public opinion on a matter.
1.11. Con: Tampons are not life sustaining like medicines, so they should be taxed.
1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.
1.11.2. Con: Poor menstrual hygiene can be life threatening. Using a tampon for too long can lead to toxic shock syndrome. This can lead to amputations or even death.[healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health/toxic-shock-syndrome#symptoms) [mirror.co.uk](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/model-whose-leg-amputated-after-11725521) [nhs.uk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/)
1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.11.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.11.5. Con: Other products, which are also not life-sustaining, are exempt from the tax.
1.11.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.3.1.8.2.1.
1.11.5.2. Con: If there should be tax exemptions for those products is beside the point.
1.11.5.3. Pro: In [Australia](https://au.news.yahoo.com/labor-says-tampon-tax-no-longer-needed-204127610--spt.html?guccounter=1), where tampons are taxed at 10%, incontinence pads, nicotine patches, and even Viagra are all exempt from taxation.
1.11.6. Con: -> See 1.6.1.
1.12. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.3.1.
