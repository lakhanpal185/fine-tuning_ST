1.1.3. Con: Idiocracy is not so much SciFi as it is social criticism.
1.1.3.1. Con: [Science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film) films have often been used to focus on political or social issues.
1.1.3.2. Con: A lot of sci-fi is social criticism, showing the amplified effects of the negative direction society heads towards.
1.1.4. Pro: One of the most relevant social commentaries ever produced as a movie!
1.1.5. Con: The intro sequence is fantastic, but the rest of the movie is a bit too slapstick.
1.1.6. Pro: Shows the progression of society with technology taking over people's lives to the point they cannot think for themselves.
1.1.6.1. Pro: This is very relevant in reality, because when we let machines take over and forget to handle the task manually \(like with pilots\), then problems emerge.
1.2. Pitch Black
1.2.1. Con: It is more of a action horror movie than science fiction.
1.2.1.1. Con: The movie features a spaceship and aliens.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: And takes place on a strange, foreign planet with two suns.
1.2.1.2. Con: If Alien is sci-fi than Pitch Black is sci-fi.
1.2.2. Pro: Riddick, the main character played by Vin Diesel was so strong \(cool\) that several movies and video games based on him followed.

1.4. Planet of the Apes
1.4.1. Pro: In 2008, the film was selected by [Empire magazine](http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/500-greatest-movies/) as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.

1.5.1. Pro: The movie stars f***ing legedary David Bowie as a humanoid alien.
1.6. Ghost Busters
1.6.1. Pro: It is child friendly and fun to watch.
1.6.1.1. Con: Being child friendly is not an important criteria regarding science fiction.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Being child friendly may be a criteria for a "good movie".
1.6.1.2. Con: Ghostbusters is not child-friendly because much of the narrative concerns sexual intercourse.  The names Keymaster and Gatekeeper are references to the male penis and the female vagina.  Much of the narrative concerns attempting keep those two characters apart and when it fails the [both characters appear post-coital](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/69/85/98/69859822a6d87088dd98dd1713bc0729.png).
1.6.1.2.1. Con: The Keymaster, gatekeeper thing is sufficiently abstruse that a child wouldn't understand, so it doesn't matter.

1.6.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.6.2.6. Pro: The Grand Budapest Hotel
1.6.2.7. Pro: It's Bill Fucking Murray after all
1.6.3. Con: Ghost Busters does not have anything to do with science.
1.6.3.1. Pro: It is rather a supernatural horror comedy film than science fiction.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Actually science fiction is very much about science. The [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) even explicitly excludes the supernatural.
1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: There are [varying defintions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_science_fiction) of science fiction.
1.6.3.2. Con: Science fiction is not necessarily about science.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Science fiction not only deals with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology but also with the supernatural, extraterrestrial life etc.
1.6.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.6.3.1.1.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.6.5. Con: The movie does not have any SciFi message.
1.6.5.1. Con: The arrival of aliens, and what they might be like is a huge science fiction topic.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.6.7. Pro: The film's theme song is awesome.
1.6.8. Con: Ghostbusters is [a film with no character development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OB3279Vt8Y) and by virtue of that it is inherently uninteresting.
1.6.8.1. Con: Just because a film lacks character development doesn't automatically mean it's uninteresting. The film Koyaanisqatsi has no characters or plot, but it's interesting.
1.6.8.1.1. Pro: As long as a film is not driven by characters character development is not necessary to make that film interesting.
1.6.8.1.2. Con: Ghostbusters is a character driven narrative.  It relies on characters to tell the narrative but does not develop those characters and so it is uninteresting.
1.7. Ender's Game
1.7.1. Con: The movie cannot be really appreciated without having read the book.
1.7.2. Pro: The story delivers a great message about racism, prejudice and war in general.
1.7.3. Con: The movie leaves out a lot of what makes the book great.
1.7.4. Con: The book had so much inner drama going for it that the movie missed.  The movie did not make a good connection with the audience.
1.8. Akira
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.8.2. Pro: The film is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest animated and science fiction movies of all time. \([screenjunkies.com](http://www.screenjunkies.com/movies/movie-lists/10-best-anime-movies-of-all-time/); [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/akira-otomo-fantasy-sci-fi); [uk.complex.com](http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/05/the-50-best-sci-fi-movies/akira)\)
1.8.3. Pro: The film has garnered a large following as a cult film.
1.9. Men in Black
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.
1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.9.4. Con: It stars Will Smith.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Will Smith used his Hollywood influence to produce Scientology propaganda \(After Earth\).
1.9.4.1.1. Pro: Some critics were struck by what they saw as [parallels](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324412604578515000854294308) in the movie's plot, dialogue and imagery with the Scientology teachings of L. Ron Hubbard.
1.9.4.1.1.1. Con: David S. Touretzky, a research professor at Carnegie Mellon and a well-known expert on and critic of Scientology [dismissed](http://gawker.com/after-earth-is-just-a-shitty-movie-not-scientology-pro-510569401) these perceived parallels, saying "I don't see any Scientology content at all in this movie".
1.9.4.2. Con: The fresh prince is always an enrichment.
1.9.5. Con: Men in Black is a Science Fantasy film.
1.10. 2001: A Space Odyssey
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.10.2. Con: The ending is just confusing.
1.10.3. Pro: The beginning [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtbOmpTnyOc) of an early stage human throwing a bone into the sky which suddenly becomes a satellite is epic and brilliant.
1.10.3.1. Pro: The scene demonstrates the whole technological progress, the whole human development, in one simple but very strong image.
1.10.3.2. Pro: The scene compares a simple tool like a bone stick to a space vessel. This emphasizes that in all human history and apparent progress, not much has changed at all, except the tools are more advanced.
1.10.4. Pro: Anything from Stanley Kubrick is amazing.
1.10.4.1. Pro: Full Metal Jacket
1.10.4.2. Pro: Dr. Strangelove
1.10.4.3. Pro: Spartacus
1.10.4.4. Pro: Lolita
1.10.4.5. Pro: The Shining
1.10.4.6. Pro: Eyes Wide Shut
1.10.4.6.1. Con: Any movie with Tom Cruise cannot be taken seriously.
1.10.4.6.1.1. Pro: A movie with Tom Cruise is always in danger of becoming Scientology propaganda.
1.10.4.6.1.1.1. Pro: John Travolta used his Hollywood influence to produce Scientology propaganda \(Battlefield Earth\).
1.10.4.6.1.1.2. Pro: Scientology is very inclined to have prominent people distribute their mindset.
1.10.4.6.1.1.3. Con: Tom Cruise is just an actor, not the screenwriter or director. His influence on a movie's plot is thus marginal.
1.10.4.6.1.1.3.1. Con: A prominent actor has the power to influence which movies get made just by agreeing to take a part in it.
1.10.4.6.1.1.4. Con: So far Tom Cruise has not been part of any movie containing Scientology propaganda.
1.10.4.6.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.1.
1.10.4.6.1.2. Pro: E.g. "Mission Impossible", "Top Gun", "Days of Thunder", "Cocktail" and "Knight and Day".
1.10.4.6.1.2.1. Con: "Mission Impossible" \(the first one\), "Top Gun" and "Days of Thunder" are Hangover-cure-classics for every day after partying, especially sundays.
1.10.4.6.1.3. Con: "Rain Man" is a good movie.
1.10.4.6.1.4. Con: "Magnolia" is a great movie.
1.10.4.6.2. Pro: The original book by [Arthur Schnitzler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schnitzler) is fantastic.
1.10.4.7. Pro: Barry Lyndon
1.10.5. Pro: Back in 1968, Stanley Kubrick made some astonishing prognoses on technology we indeed have and use today \(but not in 2001\).
1.10.5.1. Pro: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c_rSLXq6U) you can see ipad like devices.
1.10.5.2. Pro: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c_rSLXq6U&t=37) you can see the astronauts using something very similar to Skype or Facetime.
1.10.6. Pro: The movie's soundtrack is extraordinary and famous for its many uses of orchestral and classical pieces, and imparts the movie its unique atmosphere.
1.10.7. Pro: 2001 was the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2c_rSLXq6U) big budget science fiction movie, before it, science fiction movies were mainly "b-movies". So it paved the way for all the following SciFi motion pictures and furthermore the success and popularity of the genre.
1.10.8. Pro: It fulfills important criteria for a science fiction movie.
1.10.8.1. Pro: One of the movie's main protagonists, HAL 9000, is a computer.
1.10.8.2. Pro: It accurately depicts space travel.
1.10.9. Con: It is said, that you can only really appreciate 2001 under the influence of LSD. Having to do drugs to watch a movie disqualifies it from the best SciFi movie list \(similar to doping\).
1.10.9.1. Pro: The closing sequence very much resembles what people describe an LSD trip to be.
1.10.9.2. Pro: [Kubrick himself admitted](http://turnmeondeadman.com/trippy-films-2001-a-space-odyssey-1968/), that the colorful images have some connection to an LSD trip.
1.10.10. Pro: The movie has some deep messages.
1.10.10.1. Pro: In an interview, Kubrick [said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_2001:_A_Space_Odyssey) "On the deepest psychological level the film's plot symbolizes the search for God, and it finally postulates what is little less than a scientific definition of God \[...\] The film revolves around this metaphysical conception, and the realistic hardware and the documentary feelings about everything were necessary in order to undermine your built-in resistance to the poetical concept."
1.10.10.2. Con: This can quickly bore people as it gets too complicated.
1.10.11. Pro: "2001: A Space Odyssey" was voted [#1](http://www.ofcs.org/ofcs-top-100-top-100-sci-fi-films/) of the Top 100 Sci-Fi Movies of all time by the Online Film Critics Society \(OFCS\)
1.10.12. Pro: One of the movie's side topics, how artificial intelligence and humans would coexist, today is more important than ever.
1.10.12.1. Pro: The conception and execution of HAL was stunningly predicting where AI/ML is heading these days.
1.10.13. Con: 2001 lacks a truly coherent plot.
1.10.14. Con: A lot of 2001 is really boring.
1.11. Blade Runner 2049
1.11.1. Pro: Blade Runner paints a very dark picture of our future if humanity does not change how it treats the planet, and thus gives a warning that is still very important over 30 years later.
1.11.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #4540: Humans should act to fight climate change.
1.11.2. Pro: Its creative sets and exploration of artificial intelligence are one of a kind.
1.11.3. Con: Harrison Fords character gets a little ' Harvey Weinstein' on Rachel.
1.11.3.1. Con: This scene was edited heavily - even for the final cut, and it doesn't get the time it needs to portray a very complicated relationship moment.

Ridley's editor Terry Rawlings discusses this in the brilliant making of documentary "Dangerous Days".
1.11.4. Con: Philip Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' puts the issue forth in a more complex more thorough manner. [My thoughts on movie, sequel, and source novel](https://criticafterdark.blogspot.com/2017/10/blade-runner-vs-blade-runner-2049.html)
1.11.5. Pro: Blade Runner addresses a lot of humanity's fundamental questions: What defines humanity? What is real? etc.
1.11.5.1. Pro: Blade Runner has it all. The storyline is pure sci-fi--the question what makes us human? The art direction was superb--so many iconic scenes and the noir in a dystopian world that doesn't seem that all far off. This movie can be watched over and over again. Come for Harrison Ford--but stay for Hauer's last lines.
1.11.6. Pro: Blade Runner received only one but therefore very good [Video Game](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/blade-runner), embracing the whole Blade Runner universe and creating an atmosphere in a video game which still remains amongst the best out there.
1.11.7. Pro: Blade Runner creates a clever bridge between Film Noir and modern science fiction.
1.11.7.1. Pro: This genre is called Cyberpunk. William Gibson \(considered to be one of the most prominent figures in cyberpunk culture\) went to see the movie Blade Runner as he was writing his book "Neuromancer" and declared it was the most influential film of his lifetime. [William Gibson and Blade Runner](https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-did-william-gibson-really-feel-about-blade-runner-896472321)
1.11.8. Pro: The book was written by Philip K. Dick, one of the most acclaimed SciFi authors ever.
1.11.8.1. Con: Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov are more highly regarded in SF.  Dick is only in the top 25 somewhere.
1.11.8.2. Con: While the original Blade Runner was loosely based on Dick's book, and Blade Runner 2049 refers to the story and employs characters of Blade Runner, saying that 2049 is based on Dick's novel is clearly an overshot.
1.12. [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_\(film\))
1.12.1. Pro: The storytelling is very diverse, making the movie interesting.
1.12.2. Pro: The main actor, [Sam Rockwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Rockwell), deliveres the character very well.
1.13. Solaris \(2002\)
1.13.1. Pro: The music delivers the mysterious mood of the movie well.
1.13.2. Pro: It combines good elements of different genres: love story, mysterious, thrilling, all happening in space.
1.13.3. Con: The movie is boring.
1.13.4. Pro: It is a very touching story.
1.13.5. Con: This movie makes use of the SciFi environment to actually be a romance movie.
1.13.5.1. Con: Movies do not have to fit into a single genre.
1.14. [Another Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Earth)
1.14.1. Pro: It is an independent movie with low budget leading to a very focused story telling.
1.14.2. Pro: The movie leaves a very touching experience and encourages thinking of 'what would I do'.
1.15. Mad Max
1.15.1. Pro: The integration of music into the movie, through the [music truck](https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2015/may/18/mad-max-fury-road-crazy-guitar-guy-doof-warrior-turning-it-up-to-11), was entertaining.
1.15.2. Con: "Mad Max" is considered a dystopian action film, not a science fiction movie.
1.15.2.1. Con: [Dystopias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian_and_dystopian_fiction) are commonly found in science fiction and arguably are by definition a type of speculative fiction.
1.15.2.2. Pro: There is pretty much no "science" in Mad Max.
1.15.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.3.2.
1.15.2.3. Pro: There are no aliens, space traveling, futuristic weapons or robots.
1.15.2.3.1. Con: But it plays in the future.
1.15.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.15.4. Pro: The setting is epic.
1.16. Serenity
1.16.1. Pro: Anything directed by Joss Whedon is awesome.
1.16.2. Con: You need to have seen "Firefly" to understand it.
1.16.2.1. Con: The movie re-hashes character development that was performed in the TV series.
1.16.3. Pro: Serenity \(and Firefly\) show analogies between humankind's space expansion and the gold rush during North America's settlement.
1.16.4. Pro: It is able to maintain both a strong plot and a strong character base.
1.16.5. Con: It's more of a science fantasy film.
1.16.6. Con: -> See 1.16.2.1.
1.17. Back to the Future
1.17.1. Pro: It features the world’s coolest car.
1.17.2. Pro: It features a quite plausible concept of time travel as far as movies go.
1.17.2.1. Con: The photo in which Marty's family slowly disintegrates is quite implausible.
1.17.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.17.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.17.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.
1.17.6. Con: It's not really a science fiction film. It's at best science fantasy. You could replace Doc Brown with a time traveling wizard and it would work just as well.
1.18. Brazil
1.18.1. Pro: It is directed by the great director and screenwriter [Terry Gilliam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gilliam#Directing), who has directed such awesome movies as "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" and "The Fisher King".
1.18.1.1. Pro: Terry Gilliam was a member of Monty Python.
1.18.1.1.1. Pro: Monty Python were awesome!
1.18.2. Pro: It is a dystopian science fiction film cleverly satirizing the bureaucratic.
1.18.3. Pro: Any movie with awesome actor Robert De Niro is worth a watch.
1.18.3.1. Pro: Mean Streets
1.18.3.2. Pro: Taxi Driver
1.18.3.3. Pro: The Godfather
1.18.3.4. Pro: Angel Heart
1.18.3.5. Pro: Goodfellas
1.18.3.6. Pro: A Bronx Tale
1.18.3.7. Pro: Casino
1.18.3.8. Pro: Heat
1.18.3.9. Pro: Wag the Dog
1.18.3.10. Pro: Ronin
1.18.3.11. Pro: The Score
1.18.3.12. Pro: The Good Shepherd
1.18.3.13. Pro: True Confessions
1.18.3.14. Pro: Once Upon a Time in America
1.18.3.15. Pro: The Untouchables

1.18.3.18. Con: Analyze That
1.18.3.19. Con: Dirty Grandpa
1.18.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.18.5. Con: The plot is quite slow.
1.18.6. Con: For viewers who read Fahrenheit 451 or 1984 this movie does not give any new insight.
1.18.7. Pro: Particularly relevant today for the prescient exploration of surveillance and terrorism.
1.18.8. Pro: It builds a rich, imaginative world without relying on special effects or tricks.
1.18.9. Pro: Features a very unexpected ending that stays in memory for a long time.
1.18.10. Pro: Depicts the absurdities of real life \(These „this is like in Brazil“ moments\)
1.19. A Clockwork Orange
1.19.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.19.2. Pro: The actors are great.
1.19.2.1. Con: Not all the actors are great. There is Keanu Reeves in it.
1.19.2.1.1. Con: Keanu Reeves is not that bad.
1.19.2.2. Con: Actors being great has nothing to do with why the movie's science fiction elements make it a great movie. The same could be said of any movie of any genre.
1.19.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.19.4. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.
1.19.5. Con: -> See 1.15.2.3.
1.19.6. Con: It is not a science fiction movie but rather a dystopian crime movie.
1.19.7. Pro: Shows that sci-fi does not have to be all about spaceships or robots: it can be about how we use advances in psychology and medicine.
1.19.8. Pro: The movie's soundtrack is awesome.
1.19.8.1. Pro: Beethoven is on it.
1.19.9. Pro: It extrapolates today's society and issues a warning about where we are determined to go.
1.19.10. Con: The novel extra chapter and all is much better.
1.20. RoboCop
1.20.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.21. A.I. Artificial Intelligence
1.21.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.21.2. Pro: Once human beings develop sentimental feelings for machines and objects, why not imagine the inverse can happen?
1.22. Gravity
1.22.1. Pro: Gravity received critical acclaim.
1.22.2. Con: The fire extinguisher scene - a core element of the whole story - is just ridiculous and quite impossible to do in reality, although the movie tries to communicate a very realistic feeling.
1.22.3. Con: It is a recent film and therefore hard to compare to some of the others that have cemented their importance in the history of film.
1.22.3.1. Con: "Birth of a Nation" was historically important, that doesn't mean its good.
1.22.4. Con: George Clooney's character is annoying and overacted.
1.22.5. Pro: Gravity shows the consequences of space junk, even with the smallest pieces causing issues.
1.22.6. Con: The storyline is too boring, because it is about one issue that is really short. People get the point in the trailer \(i.e. something crashes into a spacecraft in space\), so there is no need to watch the movie.
1.23. Avatar
1.23.1. Pro: The underlying social and political themes in "Avatar" attracted attention.
1.23.2. Pro: [Time](http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/17/top-10-movies-of-the-millennium/#avatar-2009-u-s) ranked Avatar number 3 in their list of "The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium \(Thus Far\)".
1.23.2.1. Con: Avatar came out less than 10 years into the new millenium meaning that it had gone up against \<1% of all the movies that are likely to be made in the next 1000 years.
1.23.3. Con: Avatar is not SciFi but Pocahontas in space.
1.23.4. Pro: Avatar was a technical breakthrough for 3D cinema.
1.23.4.1. Con: "Birth of a Nation" was a technical breakthrough.
1.23.5. Con: It has far too much exposition in it; early on, characters repeatedly tell each other things they have no need to talk about, so that the viewer can learn the backstory.
1.23.6. Con: It's terribly written.
1.23.7. Con: Avatar is a science fantasy, not a science fiction film. This film could just as easily be about elves in Middle Earth.
1.23.8. Con: This is such a ripoff of [FernGully](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0192618/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
1.24. Galaxy Quest
1.24.1. Pro: By Grabthar's hammer, you shall be avenged!
1.24.2. Con: This movie was super fun--but a parody and shouldn't count as pure sci-fi.
1.24.2.1. Con: in order to make a good satire film, you have to have a very in-depth knowledge of the genre you are attempting to parody.
1.24.3. Pro: Best depiction of how beaming really would feel like for nomal people
1.25. Primer
1.25.1. Pro: One of the deepest, most complex and unique stories ever told in the Science Fiction genre.
1.25.2. Con: It is difficult to fully understand without resort to Wikipedia.
1.25.3. Con: While the complexity of its storytelling is topnotch, it’s not a very fun movie to watch due to low-budget production values.
1.26. Interstellar
1.26.1. Con: The physics of Interstellar are completely off, even though Kip Thorne consulted.
1.26.1.1. Con: It is science 'fiction' not science, so it is not of importance if the physics are correct or wrong.
1.26.1.1.1. Pro: Most science fiction movies violate scientific principles.
1.26.1.1.2. Con: The science principles violated by The Matrix are *huge*. It would be one thing if they made it so you could hear space ships exploding, or people boiled to death in the vacuum of space, or the physics of space travel was a little wonky, or...

Ignoring the laws of thermodynamics is bigger than ignoring relativity to have FTL travel, etc.
1.26.1.2. Pro: Wrongly depicting so much science when having a physicist of great renown helping with the movie, is an achievement in itself.
1.26.1.3. Con: The physics of Interstellar aren't completely off. If you compare it to, IDK Star Wars, Gravity, The Core, Honey I shrunk the Kids, Back to the Future, Aeon Flux, Jurassic Park, The Matrix, Avatar.... you get my point.
1.26.1.4. Con: "Sunshine" does not apply the Newtonian laws of gravity well, and yet is considered as a great SciFi movie.
1.26.1.5. Con: According to an astrophysicist Neil de Grasse Tyson, science of Interstellar was [accurate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7tV7v71k-I).
1.26.2. Pro: The movie illustrates Einstein's theory of relativity in a dramatic and entertaining way.
1.26.2.1. Pro: Time and space are not disconnected dimensions. There is only space time and as gravity affects space, it also affects time.
1.26.2.2. Pro: The depiction is also educational to the layperson.
1.26.3. Con: A third of the movie is "driving through cornfields", another third is "flying through space without any cause" and the final third is "I always wanted to remake 2001".
1.26.4. Con: Most of the movie does not present anything new to cinema
1.26.4.1. Con: In saying most does not you are saying that, one assumes, some does which would be a positive.
1.26.4.2. Con: Interstellar is the only movie I've ever seen which \(fairly accurately\) uses the theory of relativity of as a plot element.
1.26.4.3. Con: Interstellar is unique in its consultation with Kip Thorne, which resulted in the most accurate visual depictions of wormholes and black holes in cinema ever.
1.26.4.4. Pro: The most impressive part of the movie is its time travel obeys the Novikov self-consistency principle.  Most time travel stories violate it because it’s too hard to obey it.  So that is something innovative.
1.26.5. Con: This is an almost indescribably bad film. Even the supposed environmental crisis on earth is poorly thought out.
1.26.6. Pro: Whilst this film is [not completely scientifically accurate](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-truth-behind-interstellars-scientifically-accurate-1686120318), it is based on scientific evidence but is clearly a fictional film. Lynda Obst and Kip Thorne initiated the original idea, "to make a science-fiction film where the more outlandish concepts were derived from real-world science" \([THR, 2015](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/christopher-nolan-interstellar-critics-making-760897)\). Therefore, Interstellar epitomises the idea of 'science-fiction'.
1.26.7. Con: So visually stunning it must be seen on the big screen; and I am not talking about the closeup's of McConaughey.  Watching a second time through some of the scenes became monotonous.  A good movie but not the best.
1.27. Star Wars - A New Hope \(IV\)
1.27.1. Pro: Star Wars has many typical SciFi [elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film) like robots, futuristic weapons and vehicles, interstellar space traveling, extraterrestrial lifeforms and alien worlds, even a man created planet, the death star.
1.27.2. Con: Star Wars is mainly a fantasy movie located in space or spaceships while traveling to other planets.
1.27.2.1. Pro: The main protagonists are heroes in a classic way, moral upright sword fighters claiming for justice.
1.27.2.2. Pro: Not science is the most important, but a fantastic skill called "the force".
1.27.2.3. Pro: It lacks the questions revolving around the ethical use of technology.
1.27.3. Pro: The first Star Wars contains many scientific elements.
1.27.3.1. Pro: Han Solo explains before starting into light speed the computer needs time to calculate, otherwise they could crash into a star.
1.27.3.2. Pro: The Death star is located in an orbit around a planet and has to wait till it reaches ta certain position in the orbit to destroy the rebel's headquarter.
1.27.3.3. Pro: The pod escape [here](https://www.quora.com/Is-Star-Wars-science-fiction-or-fantasy) has definitely a real rocket launch as role mode.
1.27.3.4. Con: The physics of Star Wars are wrong on multiple levels.
1.27.3.4.1. Pro: There is sound in space.
1.27.3.4.2. Pro: There are exotic Light Sabres.
1.27.3.4.3. Pro: The Millenium Falcon is "the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs".
1.27.3.4.4. Con: -> See 1.26.1.1.
1.27.3.4.5. Pro: There are explosions in space.
1.27.4. Pro: Concerning the fortune magazine, Star Wars clearly [rules](http://fortune.com/2015/03/06/10-highest-grossing-scifi-films/) the top ten of the highest grossing science fiction movies of all time \(adjusted for inflation\).
1.27.4.1. Con: In the [list of highest grossing](http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/records/All-Time-Worldwide-Box-Office) movies Star Wars IV sits on number 61, topped by three other Star Wars movies and the likes of Avatar.
1.27.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.27.6. Pro: Chewbacca [performs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQIwEZlOzp4) the nicest and most cultured sounds of all creatures in the universe.
1.27.7. Con: The characters don't have any depth.
1.28. Ghost in the Shell \(1995\)
1.28.1. Pro: It is a famous science fiction anime film.
1.28.2. Pro: It was the first anime video to reach [Billboard's #1](http://icv2.com/articles/comics/view/5674/ghost-shell-anime-special-edition) video slot at the time of its release.
1.28.3. Pro: It plays in the not so distant future \(2029\) and is a lot about cyborgs, high technology body implants and cyberterrorism - amazing SciFi material with strong relevance for the present as well.
1.28.4. Pro: Besides being an amazingly animated film it touches deep topics like AI as a sentient being and what makes us human.
1.28.5. Pro: It has a very unique and atmospherical [Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvaC6cIrntI), which adds another layer of depth to it.
1.28.6. Pro: The music video of the famous dance music classic "[King Of My Castle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwdlqquJDK4)"\(Wamdue Project\) consists of scenes of Ghost in the Shell. This underlines the pop cultural relevance.
1.28.7. Pro: Ghost in the Shell has philosophical themes, cf. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_Ghost_in_the_Shell).
1.28.7.1. Pro: The ghost concept is borrowed from  "The Ghost in the Machine" a book about philosophical psychology by Arthur Koestler.
1.28.7.1.1. Pro: The "ghost in the machine" is British philosopher Gilbert [Ryle's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_machine) description of René Descartes' mind-body dualism.
1.28.7.2. Pro: The ship of [Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) is a thought experiment recorded by Plutarch that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. The same question is dealt with in Ghost in the Shell, after almost all body parts get replaced, expect the brain, the domicile of the ghost.
1.28.8. Pro: Ghost in the Shell succeeds in being highly imaginative, cinematic, bold and yet still falls into the genre of hard science fiction, not stepping into science fantasy. Managing to do so and creating a world that spawned two engaging sequels, two TV series and a live action remake is a great achievement.
1.29. Pacific Rim
1.29.1. Pro: The plot is pure Sci-Fi: The movie is set in the future, when Earth is at war with colossal monsters from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the gigantic humanoid mechas each controlled by at least two pilots, whose minds are joined by a neural bridge.
1.29.2. Con: -> See 1.22.3.
1.29.3. Pro: A guilty pleasure
1.30. The Martian
1.30.1. Pro: Illustrates a likely potential future scenario.
1.30.1.1. Pro: Helps us understand how to live on Mars, something we may need in the future.
1.30.2. Pro: The movie contains lots of science, technology, biology.
1.30.3. Con: Matt Damon, although an amazing actor, was a poor fit for this role.
1.30.4. Pro: Based on excellent source material, that itself was based more on science than fiction.
1.30.5. Con: This was a boring movie for a movie screen, better for home. Still, even though it's memorable, most of the time it's watching and waiting for the next important part of the scene instead of 'cutting to the chase'.
1.30.6. Pro: Teaches people how to survive one situation that may occur while on Mars.
1.31. The Matrix
1.31.1. Pro: It is a visual extravaganza.
1.31.1.1. Pro: The "bullet time" was something never seen before.
1.31.1.1.1. Pro: Bullet Time influenced several other movies and computer games.
1.31.1.2. Pro: The protagonists wear very slick and wicked outfits/ styles.
1.31.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.31.3. Pro: -> See 1.19.2.
1.31.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.31.5. Con: Unfortunately, its story was continued in two sub-par sequels so that many people preferred [there were no sequels at all](http://xkcd.com/566/).
1.31.5.1. Pro: The film's success led to the making of two sequels: "[The Matrix Reloaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Reloaded)" and "[The Matrix Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Revolutions)".
1.31.6. Con: With its incorporation of wire fu techniques the movie is rather a neo-noir action film than science fiction.
1.31.7. Pro: The unique story of The Matrix is very philosophical and loaded with society criticism.
1.31.7.1. Pro: It can be seen as a wake-up call to think for yourself, look at the "truth" / reality as it really is, instead of comfortably living in an illusory world, which is controlled by others, by an external force.
1.31.7.2. Pro: Important philosophical terms are covered and questioned consequently. What is truth? What is reality?
1.31.7.3. Con: The philosophical aspects are reduced and dumbed down to small portions, naive dialogues \(after all it is a movie\) and scenes made for the sake of symbolism. That ist not really "very philosophical" and with each movie it disappeared more and more.
1.31.8. Pro: The Matrix even influenced the fashion style of its period.
1.31.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.31.1.2.
1.31.8.2. Pro: Long black leather coats were extremely coveted.
1.31.9. Pro: "The Matrix" received [critical acclaim](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-matrix/critic-reviews).
1.31.10. Con: The Matrix is Science Fantasy, not science fiction.
1.31.11. Pro: For good or bad, this movie became part of our culture, therefore, it is a contender for best movie.  I will take the blue pill, thank you.
1.31.12. Con: The premise of The Matrix violates the laws of thermodynamics. The movie thus does not count as "science fiction".
1.31.12.1. Con: -> See 1.26.1.1.
1.32. After Earth
1.32.1. Con: There were nepotism allegations regarding Jaden Smith' role in the movie.
1.32.2. Con: The movie won three [Golden Raspberry Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Raspberry_Awards) for Worst Actor, Worst Supportin Actor and Worst Screen Combo.
1.32.3. Con: -> See 1.9.4.1.1.
1.32.4. Con: -> See 1.22.3.
1.33. Starship Troopers
1.33.1. Pro: Starship Troopers is an anti-war movie camouflaged as SciFi.
1.33.1.1. Pro: The "Teen TV show" format is intentional. The movie is like an overdrawn version of Full Metal Jacket. There is war propaganda on the one side with beautiful, heroic people who get slaughtered in the reality of war.
1.33.2. Con: Gigantic bugs as enemies is not very inventive, as we expect exotic never seen aliens on a great SciFi movie.
1.33.2.1. Con: There are many SciFi movies with no aliens at all.
1.33.2.2. Con: The bugs in Starship Troopers are quite inventive \(considering the book is over 50 years old\). They are highly evolved creatures who have emotions and a hive mind.
1.33.3. Con: Starship Troopers is a Teen TV Show in SciFi movie format.
1.33.3.1. Con: Starship Troopers basically is SciFi parody.
1.33.3.2. Con: -> See 1.33.1.1.
1.33.4. Con: -> See 1.33.3.1.
1.33.5. Con: Its a poor version of the book with too many departures from what the author wrote.
1.33.5.1. Con: A movie adapted from a book does not have to follow its original to be considered a "good movie".
1.33.6. Con: The book "Old Man's War" by John Scalzi truely captures the vibe, tempo, and zhouzh of Star Ship Troupers perfectly.   The fact the movies so far missed Heinlein's vibe takes this movie out of the running.
1.34. Fahrenheit 451
1.34.1. Pro: This science fiction drama is directed by legendary François Truffaut.
1.34.1.1. Con: It is a poor example of Truffaut's work and seems to lack much of his signature styling.
1.34.2. Pro: It is based on the 1953 novel of the same name by [Ray Bradbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury), who was famous for fantasy, sience fiction and mystery fiction.
1.34.3. Pro: Martin Scorsese has called the film an underrated picture which had [influenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451_%28film%29#Reception) his own films.
1.35. Alien
1.35.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.35.2. Pro: The science fiction goes less Star Trek and Star Wars, and more gritty, which makes the scares more urgent, more real.
1.35.3. Pro: The sense of a fully realised future universe and society is strong, without being directly explained.
1.35.4. Pro: The life cycle and design of the Alien species is one of the single most original and compelling things to ever come out of science fiction.
1.35.5. Pro: The direction and cinematography set a new standard for science fiction.
1.35.6. Con: The white collar roles that the crew have fails to create a convincing future where robotics and AI have taken over tedious work.
1.35.6.1. Con: Invalid argument for a movie that was released 1979.
1.35.7. Pro: Alien was one of the first action movies to feature a strong female protagonist.
1.35.8. Pro: The props were designed by H.R. Giger.
1.36. Dune
1.36.1. Pro: The book is epic and was considered unfilmable for a long time. Still it has been done, with quite some success.
1.36.1.1. Con: Dune was a [box office failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_\(film\)).
1.36.1.2. Con: Alejandro Jodorowsky, who tried to create the movie before David Lynch did, [said that Lynch's work was clearly a failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodorowsky%27s_Dune).
1.36.2. Pro: Dune is real high science fiction depicting a future so much further away than almost any other science fiction movies.
1.36.3. Con: The Dune mini-series was much better than Dune the movie which was a confusing mess.
1.36.4. Pro: The film did an impossible task: translated Frank Herbert's dense novel, complete with voluminous inner monologues, and made it coherent without losing the vibe of the original.
1.36.5. Con: Maybe after Denis Villeneuve's adaptation!
1.37. The Terminator \(1984\)
1.37.1. Con: Arnold Schwarzenegger is a bad actor.
1.37.1.1. Con: He perfectly fits the role of a machine.
1.37.1.1.1. Pro: His acting is without emotions.
1.37.1.1.2. Pro: He is a cliché muscle-machine.
1.37.1.1.3. Pro: In Terminator and Conan he was epic.
1.37.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.37.3. Pro: Time traveling, an all mighty AI called Skynet, mankind vs. machines and a cool killing machine - spicy ingredients.
1.37.4. Con: The Sci-Fi elements of the plot are ultimately dressing on what is a standard genre horror movie where an unstoppable killer stalks a young girl.
1.37.4.1. Con: SciFi and Horror are not mutually exclusive genres.
1.38. Equilibrium
1.38.1. Con: The New York Times dismissed Equilibrium for having [heavily borrowed](http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C01E1DA123BF935A35751C1A9649C8B63) from Fahrenheit 451, Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, and other science-fiction classics.
1.38.2. Pro: It stars Christian Bale who is a great actor \(e.g. American Psycho, American Hustle, The Big Short etc.\).
1.39. Prometheus
1.39.1. Pro: The film's visuals are vivid and magnificent on a technical level.
1.39.2. Pro: The movie creates more questions then answers, which make the audience think and guess a lot about it.
1.39.2.1. Pro: In the beginning of the movie one of the extraterrestrials disperses itself in a waterfall. Why? What is the cause and effect?
1.39.2.2. Pro: Why does the extraterrestrial in the end aim the earth with the "alien" gun?
1.39.2.3. Pro: Are the famous black snake-like aliens a product of coincidence? Because the nymph nested in the extraterrestrial, the probable creator of this biological weapon?
1.39.2.4. Con: The questions risen in Prometheus seem random. Also, rising the question of who created mankind is not very ingenious.
1.39.3. Con: The setting on the dusty grey planet is boring.
1.40. [Sunspring](http://arstechnica.com/the-multiverse/2016/06/an-ai-wrote-this-movie-and-its-strangely-moving/)
1.40.1. Pro: It is a short science fiction movie written entirely by an AI called [Benjamin](http://benjamin.wtf/).
1.40.1.1. Pro: What is cooler than a Sci-Fi movie written by artificial intelligence.
1.40.2. Pro: It is super weird, different from any other sience fiction and thus fun to watch.
1.40.3. Pro: The crazy dialogues are surprisingly hilarious.
1.40.4. Con: -> See 1.22.3.
1.41. Dark Star
1.41.1. Pro: Features the most cheaply designed alien ever.
1.41.2. Pro: Features a talking philosopher bomb.
1.41.3. Pro: Features the best scene about censorship of rude language in any movie.
1.42. WALL-E
1.42.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.42.2. Pro: WALL-E and his little cockroach friend are so cute.
1.42.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.
1.42.4. Con: -> See 1.22.3.
1.42.5. Con: The humans depicted as obese and lazy are too much of an oversimplified, superficial caricature and thus the whole message of the movie is taken down with that.
1.42.5.1. Con: Caricature of all forms are a great tool to expose serious messages.
1.42.5.2. Con: The oversimplification is accurate to the way Western society has developed, given its increasing obesity rates and computer usage
1.42.6. Con: It is a fun cute movie, but the title of the discussion uses the qualifier "Best".  WALL-E is up against others that reach for the stars and take hold of galaxies and wrestle gods.  We all like you WALL-E but you barley touch the clouds on a rainy day.
1.42.7. Pro: It does a good job of simplifying the complex issue of waste for everyone to understand - including children, who will be amongst the generations to have the largest impact on the topic.
1.43. Stalker
1.43.1. Pro: Out of what's listed here. Largely nonverbal, gorgeous imagery, mysterious atmosphere and sense of menace. If it isn't the greatest it's certainly the most evocative for the least effort.
1.44. Solaris \(1972\)
1.45. Zardoz
1.45.1. Con: Sean Connery's outfit is distracting and visually unpleasant.
1.46. I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK
1.47. Iron Sky
1.47.1. Pro: The plot is absurd, in an entertaining way.
1.47.1.1. Pro: iPad driven starships.
1.47.1.2. Pro: Nazis on the dark side of the moon.
1.48. Metropolis
1.48.1. Pro: Made in 1927, it is the mothership of all sci-fi, setting the template for robots, mad scientists, megacities and dystopian nightmares.
1.49. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind
1.49.1. Pro: It is an epic science fantasy adventure film written and directed by the great [Hayao Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki).
1.49.2. Pro: The film takes place in a post-apocalyptic world in the far future. This is the possibly best setting for science fiction.
1.49.3. Pro: Widely acclaimed for its story, themes, characters and animation, the movie is frequently ranked [number 2](http://www.japanprobe.com/2007/06/22/best-anime-ranking/) of the greatest animated films of all time.
1.49.4. Con: It does not follow most Science Fiction conventions and most people don't think of it as a Science Fiction movie.
1.49.4.1. Pro: It's a fantasy movie.
1.49.4.2. Con: Science fiction movies are better if they don't follow conventions.
1.49.5. Con: Nausicaa, while wonderful, is a science fantasy film.
1.50. 12 Monkeys
1.50.1. Pro: The concept of time as a fixed, unchangeable entity has never been explored more disturbingly.
1.50.2. Con: It is too artistic to be appreciated by a wide audience.
1.50.2.1. Con: The movie was able to hold the [#1 spot](http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Twelve-Monkeys#tab=box-office) on box office charts for two weeks and [grossed](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=twelvemonkeys.htm) a total of $168,839,459.
1.50.3. Pro: Any movie with Bruce Willis in it is just awesome.
1.50.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.5.
1.50.3.2. Con: Fire Fire
1.50.3.3. Con: The Prince
1.50.3.4. Con: Cold Light Day
1.50.3.5. Pro: Die Hard.
1.50.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.50.3.5.2. Pro: "Die Hard" and John McClane are iconic. Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker!
1.50.3.6. Pro: Pulp Fiction
1.50.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.50.3.7. Pro: Four Rooms
1.50.3.8. Pro: The Sixth Sense
1.50.3.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.50.3.9. Pro: Sin City
1.50.3.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.50.3.10. Pro: 16 Blocks
1.50.3.11. Pro: Red
1.50.4. Pro: The movie surprises with mind-blowing plot twists.
1.50.5. Pro: -> See 1.19.2.
1.50.6. Pro: -> See 1.18.1.
1.51. Gattaca
1.51.1. Pro: -> See 1.19.2.
1.51.2. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.
1.51.3. Pro: The movie has a smart plot combined with interesting ethical questions.
1.51.4. Con: The movie is too small of a story, not even focusing on the space travel dreams of the main character
1.51.4.1. Con: The movie is not about space travel, it is about social segregation and getting through it for a dream. People who experienced similar periods of life will tell you that getting through such a barrier eventually becomes much more of a dream in itself than what lies behind.
1.51.5. Pro: The soundtrack is amazing.
1.51.6. Pro: It focuses on a very real near future concern \(our bio-info becoming a commodity\), and treats it in a though-provoking way.
1.51.7. Pro: The movie has a well-considered and coherent aesthetic, which permeates throughout.
1.51.8. Pro: It stays "near-future", which allows for enough authenticity that it is believable.
1.51.9. Con: Gattaca is an excellent movie, but it is a terrible science fiction movie because it is almost ferociously unimaginative.
1.51.9.1. Con: There are good [reasons](https://www.depauw.edu/sfs/essays/gattaca.htm) to consider Gattaca's approach to the DNA-based segregation as unique in SciFi.
1.52. Flash Gordon
1.52.1. Pro: The soundtrack is just legendary.
1.53. Ex Machina
1.53.1. Con: The characters are one-dimensional.
1.53.1.1. Pro: The supposed "genius" uses his astounding engineering abilities to create sex slave robots.
1.53.1.2. Pro: Caleb is nothing more than a passive viewer, a voyeur.
1.53.1.3. Pro: Ava's motives seem to be limited to getting out of her prison and killing her maker.
1.53.2. Con: The movie treats an important and interesting subject and does absolutely nothing with it.
1.53.3. Con: The whole premise of the plot - a Turing test where the subject knows that he is talking to an AI beforehand - is utterly pointless.
1.53.3.1. Con: That's the point, that I believe is discussed in the film. The point is not for him to not know that it's an AI, but for the AI to convince him that it isn't.
1.53.4. Pro: It left viewers with -an unsettled feeling amount what stance to take ethically.  The best science fiction always does this - leaves the audience to ask questions.
1.53.5. Con: It has way too much nudity, which means that I can't suggest it to my parents or comfortably watch it with my girlfriend, which is a bummer.
1.53.6. Pro: It has an amazing plot.
1.53.7. Pro: It depicts how we have to convince ourselves that other people aren't human  to do horrible things to them.
1.53.8. Pro: It's one of the best Science Fiction films that deals with AI ever.
1.54. District 9
1.54.1. Pro: District 9 is an intelligent parable on racism.
1.54.2. Pro: It contains spaceships, aliens and futuristic weapons.
1.55. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan
1.55.1. Pro: The movie closes a 20 year old story arc, something no other movie has done before.
1.55.2. Pro: Famed director J.J. Abrams tried to remake it, failing miserably.
1.55.3. Pro: Star Trek in general tackles a lot of the big topics, and ST2 is the best of the bunch.
1.55.4. Pro: Spock dying is one of the most emotional scenes in the history of SciFi movies.
1.55.4.1. Pro: I cant hear amazing grace without thinking of this film now.
1.55.5. Pro: The villain is a very relatable character.
1.55.6. Pro: It's Star Trek! 'nuff said!
1.55.7. Pro: The Enterprise is in it.
1.55.7.1. Pro: Even a Space Shuttle has been named after it.
1.56. Pi
1.56.1. Pro: It is written and directed by legendary Darren Aronofsky.
1.56.1.1. Pro: Any movie written and/or directed by Darren Aronofsky is worth a watch.
1.56.1.1.1. Pro: Requiem for a Dream
1.56.1.1.2. Pro: The Fountain
1.56.1.1.3. Pro: Black Swan
1.56.1.1.4. Pro: The Wrestler
1.56.1.1.5. Pro: The Fighter
1.56.2. Pro: It is an intriguing work of science fiction based on interesting themes such as mathematics, [complex game strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_\(game\)), [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah) and religion.
1.56.3. Pro: The film succeeds in creating a complete universe within the narrative. Once you get into it, there is no escape from the story.
1.56.4. Pro: [Sean Gulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Gullette)'s acting is incredible.
1.56.5. Con: Pi is rather a surrealist psychological thriller than classic science fiction.
1.56.5.1. Con: "Pi" is featured with a very positive review on the [Sci-Fi movie page](http://www.scifimoviepage.com/pi.html).
1.56.5.2. Con: "Pi" was voted #43 of the Top 100 Sci-Fi Movies of all time by the Online Film Critics Society \([OFCS](http://www.ofcs.org/ofcs-top-100-top-100-sci-fi-films/)\).
1.56.6. Pro: "Pi" launched the film scoring career of the amazing composer [Clint Mansell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Mansell).
1.56.6.1. Pro: The score composed by Clint Mansell creates the tense atmosphere and perfectly captures the protagonist's personality.
1.56.7. Pro: The fundamental idea of science fiction is challenging reality by creating a fantasy world in any possible time. "Pi" has mastered this condition, by refusing to use any distinguishing features that classical Hollywood science fiction films consist of.
1.56.7.1. Pro: Audiences have been conditioned to associate Sci-Fi with lots of decoration, space chases and cutting edge FX. But essentially, science fiction is something that happens between your ears. As a matter of fact, the term "science fiction" does not mean anything but imagination. And this is what "Pi" consequently relates to.
1.56.7.2. Pro: "Pi" does not give an impression of science fiction merely by concentrating on showing probable future scenarios. It tries to show that pure science fiction happens inside your fantasy, not on your retina.
1.56.8. Pro: The cinematography is amazing. Framing, perspective, camera movements and editing all go hand in hand to make the viewer feel like protagonist Max Cohen does. The images' message is one of haunting claustrophobia and paranoia.
1.56.9. Pro: -> See 1.56.5.2.
1.57. The X-Files
1.57.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.57.2. Pro: The film's theme song is awesome.
1.57.3. Pro: It is a cult classic that is referenced a lot in other films or tv shows like eg The Simpsons.
1.57.4. Pro: The release of this movie was the reason to produce a full motion video \(FMV\) [game](http://spookyverse.de/wiki/Akte_X_-_Das_Spiel_\(Videospiel\)) starring Mulder, Scully and other charakters, expanding on the backstory of the universe.
1.57.4.1. Pro: Even people who usually absolutely do not like the X-Files enjoyed that game and at least go into X-Files a little bit because of that.
1.58. Donnie Darko
1.58.1. Con: "Donnie Darko" is a fantasy drama film, not science fiction.
1.58.1.1. Con: The director's commentary on the DVD - which is [discussed on The DVD Journal](http://www.dvdjournal.com/reviews/d/donniedarko.shtml) -  suggests that the movie has a basis in science and adheres to that fictional science.
1.58.2. Pro: The movie received very positive reviews, with praise towards the acting, writing and atmosphere. \([abc.net.au](http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/film/s702145.htm); [metacritic.com](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/donnie-darko-the-directors-cut)\)
1.58.3. Pro: In 2002 the movie [won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnie_Darko#Awards_and_nominations) the "Special Award" at the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films's 28th Saturn Awards.
1.58.4. Con: Halfway through the film, it lost its plot and relied only on mood and soundtrack to limp to the end.
1.59. Snowpiercer
1.59.1. Pro: Snowpiercer was praised for its perfomances.
1.59.1.1. Pro: Especially [Tilda Swinton](https://newrepublic.com/article/118322/snowpiercer-review-joon-ho-bongs-exuberant-disaster-film)'s performance is praised.
1.59.2. Pro: The film approaches topics like climate change and class systems in a new refreshing way.
1.59.3. Con: -> See 1.22.3.
1.59.4. Pro: The film's use of various metaphors and its character design are amazing. \(see for instance [this article](http://www.ddanzi.com/ddanziNews/1398770) \(Korean\) for an analysis\)
1.59.4.1. Pro: The train represents the capitalism itself with its history: the capitalism was kickstarted by the improved steam machine. Also, like time and history, trains can go only forward.
1.59.4.2. Pro: WilFORD Industry represents the FORDism which led to explosive growth of capitalism.
1.59.4.3. Pro: Gilliam represents leaders who know the flaws of capitalism \(like the inequality depicted in the train\), but do not have an alternatvie to it. He suggests to Curtis to stop after occupying the wagon with water because he knows that even after gaining control over the engine room, the foundation of the system cannot be changed.
1.59.4.4. Pro: Minsu Namgung represents intellectuals of the society. He does not speak the language of people, but speaks only his language. This shows how many progressive intellectuals fail to convey their message to the masses.
1.59.4.5. Pro: Mason represents someone who was in the working class, but made it to the upper class. To hide her origin she is being overly cruel to the lower class. She however does not have any conviction about the system as demonstrated by her instant betrayal when she got caught by Curtis. \(Swinton also speaks in Yorkshire accent which was one of the centers of the industrialization.\)
1.59.4.6. Pro: Wagon with water: water represents money. Gilliam suggests to others to wash themselves. He wants them to stop advancing since people who cleaned their bloody body do not want to have a bloody fight again, like in real revolutions people-after achieving some success-tend to lose their enthusiasm or fighting spirit.
1.59.4.7. Pro: Wagon with plants represents the middle class. They are insensitive to societal changes. The woman in the wagon does not care when people drenched in blood go by. She is just sitting there and is knitting for her family... like the middle class. She does not even react when the train explodes.
1.59.4.8. Pro: The boulder of ice on the rail track and the tunnel represent economic depressions.
1.59.4.9. Pro: The woman in yellow represents the price in capitalism. She tries to find a not too big \(=not too expensive\) and not too small \(=not too low quality\) child by measuring them. She always measures everything, even the bomb set by Namgung. In capitalism everything can and will be priced.
1.59.5. Con: The movie has a ton of plot holes.
1.59.5.1. Pro: Wilford built an "eternal engine", probably a perpetuum mobile. Instead of powering an underground city he puts it in an ever-moving train.
1.59.5.2. Pro: Curtis, in his attempt to save his people and form a successful revolution, dooms all of humanity's remains by crashing the train.
1.59.5.3. Pro: The train rides on tracks for 18 years which are buried beneath snow in an everlasting blizzard. Still, they don't need any maintenance whatsoever.
1.59.5.4. Pro: Extremely precise cross-wagon shooting with a short distance weapon, shouting for help through half of the train, freshly butchered meat without any animals, a woman with a stab wound in her leg walking perfectly fine - the list goes on and on.
1.59.6. Pro: One of the best dystopian films ever.
1.60. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
1.60.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.60.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.
1.60.3. Pro: E.T. is a cult movie.

1.60.4. Con: It is not really SciFi.
1.60.4.1. Con: There is an alien.
1.60.5. Con: -> See 1.6.5.
1.61. Gamer
1.61.1. Pro: It is a critical controversy about violence-glorifying computer games.
1.61.2. Pro: Gerard Butler chugging a bottle of whiskey to be able [to fuel a car with his own body fluids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urceNR5j49Q) is an amazing move.
1.62. Predestination \(2015\)
1.62.1. Pro: Predestination features a mind-boggling time travel plot.
1.62.2. Con: -> See 1.22.3.
1.62.3. Pro: The movie impressively shows the extreme, paradoxical implications time travel brings with it.
1.63. Guardians of the Galaxy \(2014\)
1.63.1. Pro: It has aliens, space flight, action, humor and an overarching, epic theme.
1.63.2. Pro: The soundtrack is literarily "awesome".
1.63.3. Con: It is part of a Universe which is cleary a comic adaptation and, although it has SciFi elements in it, is widely considered more as a Part of the Marvel \(movie\) Universe than a SciFi movie.
1.63.4. Con: It is not deep or consequential enough to be considered the best science fiction movie.
1.63.5. Con: It is overly commercial.
1.63.6. Con: There is a strong amount of fantasy within the film.
1.63.7. Con: It isn't science fiction. It's a superhero movie in space, not even a space opera.
1.64. Her
1.64.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.12.
1.64.2. Pro: It works as a human interest/drama film, not just a sci-fi film.
1.64.3. Pro: Contains interesting themes related to [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).
1.64.4. Pro: It is visually beautiful.
1.64.5. Con: -> See 1.22.3.
1.64.6. Con: -> See 1.13.5.
1.64.7. Con: Her \(intentionally?\) omits a very big question: The AI is a living, feeling being, copied a million times and enslaved as a personal assistant to much more stupid humans. Is this ethical?
1.64.7.1. Con: Isn't that the point of the movie?
1.64.8. Pro: This Film made me feel the greatest emotions that I ever felt for a film
1.65. The Fifth Element
1.65.1. Pro: -> See 1.50.3.
1.65.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.65.3. Pro: It is co-written and directed by French film director and screenwriter [Luc Besson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luc_Besson#Filmography), who also made masterpieces such as "Nikita" and "Léon: The Professional".
1.65.4. Pro: Milla Jovovich wears the abnormally hottest costume ever and is simply breathtaking as Leeloo.
1.65.4.1. Pro: All the costumes are fantastic, as they were designed by Jean Paul Gaultier.
1.65.5. Pro: -> See 1.19.2.
1.65.6. Pro: Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, with his small epephant lizard, is the funniest villain in science fiction.
1.65.7. Con: Chris Tucker's part is annoying.
1.65.8. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.
1.65.9. Pro: The title has philosophical meaning of love as the fifth element that only can combine four other elements our universe consist of.
1.65.10. Pro: -> See 1.19.8.
1.66. Children of Men \(2006\)
1.66.1. Pro: The movie paints a dystopian future in which people are constantly afraid of abstract terror warnings. This eerily reflects current times.
1.66.2. Pro: Children of Men scored rank 13 in a [BBC survey](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films) on the best movies of the 21st century so far.
1.66.3. Pro: It plays on multiple current fears - not only the fear of decreased fertility but specifically that the only fertile woman is a minority, mirroring the decreased fertility currently being seen in developed nations worldwide. [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4255510/)
1.67. Silent Running
1.67.1. Pro: Few characters are as sympathetic as Huey, Louie and Dewey.
1.67.2. Con: The soundtrack has dated badly.
1.68. Strange Days
1.69. [Mr. Nobody](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/)

1.70.1. Con: -> See 1.10.4.6.1.
1.70.2. Pro: -> See 1.51.3.
1.70.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.8.
1.71. Blade Runner 1982
1.71.1. Pro: The Vangelis soundtrack is memorable
1.71.2. Pro: The original Blade Runner defined the cyberpunk genre
1.71.3. Pro: The mistery about Deckard being a replicant or not is one of the best built in cinematography.
1.71.4. Pro: The cinematography was stunning and unique in its time
1.71.5. Pro: The visual language of the film set the standard for dystopian sci-fi for the next 25+ years. You can see it in manga, movies, TV shows... William Gibson, the author credited with creating the Cyberpunk genre [said](https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-did-william-gibson-really-feel-about-blade-runner-896472321),  "I was afraid to watch Blade Runner in the theater because I was afraid the movie would be better than what I myself had been able to imagine."
1.71.6. Con: Blade Runner is VERY 80's. Shouldn't the best science fiction film be more timeless?
1.71.7. Pro: Blade Runner is listed as the [number 1](http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-sci-fi-movies-of-all-time?page=5) of the "Top 25 Great Sci-Fi movies of all time" by [IGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN).
1.71.8. Pro: -> See 1.11.8.

1.74.2. Pro: Arrival realistically deals with the true foreign-ness of Aliens in ways that few Science Fiction films do.
1.74.3. Pro: Arrival has amazing writing and acting.
1.74.4. Pro: The story of Arrival is gut-wrenching beautiful.
1.74.5. Con: Definitely not in Montana.
1.75. Tron: Legacy
1.75.1. Pro: Great soundtrack by Daft Punk
1.75.2. Pro: One day worlds outside of the ones built right now will be built \(VR and underground environments\). This shows how to assemble a society using programming as the infrastructure/maintainer, sort of like the Matrix.
1.75.3. Pro: The generational difference juxtaposition shows the large technological jump potential each generation is capable of.
1.75.4. Pro: The futuristic materials, especially within the clothing \(like lights and patterns, such as hexagons\) really made the movie pop.
1.75.5. Pro: How the movie was made is futuristic, as one person played 2 characters just by putting facial features of an older person onto a younger person's body.
1.75.6. Con: This movie did not have the highest box office reviews as some people consider this movie to be boring
1.76. [The Man from Earth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/)
1.77. Transformers \(2007\)
1.78. Terminator 2 \(1991\)
1.79. The day the earth stood still \(1951\)
1.80. Sunshine
1.80.1. Pro: Listen to Brian Cox's commentary on the DVD, \(he was the science consultant and a basis for the lead character\).
1.80.1.1. Con: This claim doesn't claim anything, does it?
1.80.2. Con: The laws of Newtonian Mechanics were apparently not familiar to the playwrights.
1.81. Iron Man
1.82. Elysium
1.82.1. Pro: The pervasive issues of our time \(mainly economic inequality\) creates an even greater divide in the 2nd space race.
1.82.2. Pro: It shows the direction that the world is going, what society will do about it, and the problems that emerge when such actions are taken. The movie shows society what paths to avoid and what issues emerge so they can be handled more easily than without watching the movie
1.83. [Jurassic Park](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
1.83.1. Pro: Biotechnology bringing back animals from extinction is a sci-fi technology many scientists are trying to place into reality at this moment.

1.88.3. Pro: They way the protagonists enter the dreams \(science, technology, chemistry\) is typical SciFi.
1.88.4. Con: The ending is confusing.
1.88.4.1. Con: The ending makes perfect sense to many people, and is an excellent example of an ambiguous ending.
1.88.5. Pro: The ending is note-perfect.
1.88.6. Pro: The complexity of story-telling involved is simply mind-blowing.  It involves a dream within a dream within a dream etc., five levels deep.  And the scene where we find out how Cobb does inception to his wife Mal is amazing.  The shared dreaming technology is an inspiring science fiction concept.
1.89. Contact
1.89.1. Pro: -> See 1.19.2.
1.89.2. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.
1.89.3. Pro: What Contact does well is discovery.  The entire movie revolves round discovering an unknown and puts it in the fast lane and then compels us to make a connection to the main character.   It should have a special rating "SH" - science heads.
1.89.4. Pro: The movie features two-time Academy Award winning actress Jodie Foster.

1.89.4.2. Con: Academy Awards are not worth anything.
1.89.4.2.1. Pro: The Academy is strongly criticised for being racist and misogynic.
1.89.4.2.1.1. Pro: Academy voters are [overwhelmingly white and male](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-20120219-story.html).
1.89.4.2.1.2. Pro: There have been exactly [4 female directors nominated](http://www.filmsite.org/bestdirs1.html) for an Oscar and a single female Oscar winner in that category in the whole history of the Academy Awards up to date.

1.104.1. Pro: Brain enhancement drugs for increased senses and connection to the internet relate to transhumanism and neuralink.
1.105. [Doctor Strange](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837/?ref_=vi_close)
1.105.1. Pro: Even though it is more of an action/fantasy movie, there are sci-fi elements if one thinks about them.
1.105.2. Pro: The idea that there are more than 4 dimensions are hotly debated by scientists. Some say there are more. The possibilities of exploiting these other dimensions is something that people would like to do one day or at least think about. This movie reveals the pros and cons of doing so.
1.105.2.1. Pro: The idea of thinking beyond 4 dimensions is very mind-boggling, which makes it a great movie. This movie helps people wrap their minds around the concept, which allows people to explore/develop the realm to study/utilize string theory, nanotechnology, and more.
1.105.3. Pro: Creating portals in the movie is reminiscent of wormholes. This movie shows more about how to use wormholes in daily life than most other movies.
1.105.4. Con: It does not make sense to apply any such superlatives to Doctor Strange.  It was a perfectly ordinary Marvel actions movie with some good graphics and a bit of spirituality mixed in.
1.106. [Blackhat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2717822/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
1.106.1. Pro: The idea of hackers becoming better than ever before to the point they are able to hack the stock market is really interesting. Makes one think about what AI would counteract these threats.
1.106.2. Pro: Lets us know the issues with being too interconnected through technology, something that is becoming more and more common each day.
1.107. [The Circle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4287320/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
1.108. [Geostorm](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981128/?ref_=adv_li_tt)
1.109. [Waterworld](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114898/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
1.110. [hanna](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993842/?ref_=tt_pg)
1.110.1. Pro: Although not quite a sci-fi movie, the movie does mention how the main character does not have a father biologically. This delves into the idea of designer babies and causes the audience to think about the effects of having computers as parents on a child
1.111. [A Trip to Mars](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0008100/?ref_=tt_rec_tt) \(1918\)

1.112.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.112.2. Pro: -> See 1.27.4.
1.112.3. Pro: The movie takes the kiddie joyride aspects of its predecessor and adds an adult sensibility and thematic throughline that brings a real depth to George Lucas' galaxy far, far away.
1.112.4. Pro: The film ranks [number 3](http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/500-greatest-movies/) on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.

Pro: In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States' [National Film Registry](https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/) by the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant."
1.112.6. Pro: The "I am your father" scene is legendary.
1.112.6.1. Pro: At the latest with that scene in Episode V Star Wars the whole Star Wars Story \(told in the movies\) becomes a "Family Saga" based on the Skywalkers, adding another angle to the already complex universe.
1.112.7. Pro: The cloud city is a fantastic element and also truly SciFi, as  on planets with a high density atmosphere such a pending city would be imaginable.
1.112.8. Pro: Darth Vader is one of the most iconic villains ever.
1.112.8.1. Pro: His sinister breathing is legendary.
1.112.8.2. Pro: His theme, the "Imperial March", is just [epic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzWSJG93P8).
1.112.9. Pro: The imperial walkers are amongst the coolest vehicles on screen.
1.112.10. Pro: Star Wars is a huge part of our pop-culture.
1.112.10.1. Pro: The film still has a huge impact on current TV-shows or movies.
1.112.10.1.1. Pro: There are many references and quotes to Star Wars in other movies or TV-shows.
1.112.10.1.1.1. Pro: There is a whole episode of [Family Guy](http://familyguy.wikia.com/wiki/Something,_Something,_Something,_Dark_Side) referring to Star Wars: Episode V.
1.112.10.1.1.1.1. Pro: Family Guy not only embraced Episode V, but the [whole](http://familyguy.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Star_Wars_episodes) of the original Trilogy, showing how much beloved that universe is.
1.112.10.1.1.2. Pro: The TV-show [Big Bang Theory](http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars) often refers to Star Wars.
1.112.10.1.1.3. Pro: There is a huge list of references to [Star Wars in movies](http://starwarsfans.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_references_to_Star_Wars_in_movies).
1.112.10.1.1.4. Pro: [Spaceballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs) is a satire/parody based on Star Wars.
1.112.10.2. Pro: There is a huge list of references to [Star Wars in music](http://starwarsfans.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_references_to_Star_Wars_in_music).
1.112.11. Con: Star Wars is a fairy tale, not a SciFi movie.
1.112.11.1. Con: -> See 1.27.1.
1.112.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.27.2.
1.112.11.3. Con: Star Wars is a sci-fi story because it involves a good deal of things \(space ships/stations, laser weapons, etc\) that could only come from science. These are not magic wands or anything like that. The world is deeply rooted in technological advances that are still fiction.
1.112.11.3.1. Con: At the time when this movie came out, the Force was pure magic.
1.112.12. Pro: Star Wars encapsulates the Hero's Journey \(as described by Joseph Campbell\) better than any other science fiction film yet created.
1.112.13. Pro: Lucas always consider the movies to be "Space Opera", moving away from the traditional vision of science fiction and into something like Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon in scope.
1.112.14. Con: -> See 1.6.5.
1.113. [The Day After Tomorrow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319262/)
1.113.1. Pro: A great movie foreshadowing the fate of what happens when the Earth bypasses its feedback loops related to climate change and global warming.
1.114. [2012](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
1.115. [I Am Legend](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480249/?ref_=tt_rec_tt)
1.115.1. Pro: With antibiotic-resistant bacteria and infections getting hard to treat, a doctor trying to find a cure for a disease as serious in this movie does not seem to be far-fetched in happening in the future.
1.116. [Clockstoppers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157472/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)
1.116.1. Pro: Really neat movie displaying the time paradox \(how if someone travels faster in time than reality, they age faster\) and how entities \(corporations, laboratories...\) can negatively exploit it.
1.117. [Outbreak](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114069/?ref_=tt_rec_tti)
1.117.1. Pro: With all the Ebola outbreaks, this then sci-fi movie then is our current reality. This movie predicted the future.
1.118. [Jumper](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489099/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)
1.118.1. Pro: This movie visualizes a world where people have teleportation capabilities for us, as it's really hard to conceptualize given today's technological capabilities. However, teleportation may one day exist, and this movie helps prepare people for it.
1.119. [In Time](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/?ref_=tt_rec_tt)
1.119.1. Pro: In the future, currency might no longer be money, but something else. In this movie, it's time.
1.119.2. Pro: With immortality becoming a possibility in the future, this movie shows people's reactions to having immortality.
1.120. [Iron Giant](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129167/?ref_=adv_li_tt)
1.120.1. Pro: I can safely say that everyone who watched this movie fell in love with it \(or at least pretty close to that\).
1.121. [City of Ember](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970411/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
1.121.1. Pro: Even though IMDB does not believe this movie is sci-fi, it is. The idea of people creating a planned city, especially one underground, is something that's been in the works for a long time. This movie rolls out the issues with underground cities so we can make much better ones.

1.131.2. Pro: The story is so exciting and interesting a new version with Colin Farrell was made in 2012.
1.131.3. Pro: Artificially generated memories implanted in human minds felt as reality. That is SciFi!
1.131.3.1. Pro: An Individual is the sum of her or his experiences and therefore memories. They are of tremendous importance for human self understanding and perception, finally identity. The power of manipulating memories would have extensive consequences and would change how humans live sustainably.
1.131.4. Pro: A prostitute with 3 boobs? Only in Total Recall!
1.131.5. Pro: -> See 1.31.7.2.
1.131.6. Pro: -> See 1.11.8.
