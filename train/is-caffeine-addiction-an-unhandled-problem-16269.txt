Discussion Title: Is Caffeine Addiction An Unhandled Problem?

1. Caffeine addiction is an unhandled problem.
1.1. Pro: Caffeine's healthy effects could be gained by better habits such as working out and eating healthily.
1.1.1. Con: The adrenaline rush is very difficult to replicate from natural means.
1.1.2. Pro: [Working out](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/exercise-versus-caffeine-which-is-your-best-ally-to-fight-fatigue-2017060811843) has many of the same benefits as consuming caffeine.
1.1.2.1. Con: Some studies indicate that best results are found [combining](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/exercise-versus-caffeine-which-is-your-best-ally-to-fight-fatigue-2017060811843) exercise and caffeine, meaning caffeine's positive influence cannot be ignored.
1.2. Pro: Caffeine is just an indirect way of getting adrenaline, something that can, if relied upon regularly for the long term, lead to adrenal burn out and chronic fatigue syndrome.
1.2.1. Pro: Caffeine can cause [heart issues](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/energy-drinks-can-trigger-sudden-heart-attacks-even-in-healthy-young-people-study-finds-10152418.html) for young people.
1.2.2. Pro: Caffeine can cause [adrenal fatigue](https://adrenalfatiguesolution.com/caffeine-adrenal-glands/) which is hard to break out of.
1.2.3. Pro: Despite short-term relief of symptoms, caffeine can [exacerbate the symptoms](https://www.everydayhealth.com/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/relief-with-caffeine.aspx) of chronic fatigue.
1.3. Con: Caffeine is normal in society
1.3.1. Con: Normalcy is not a standard to decide about something being a problem in terms of health.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Tobacco is also normal and most people acknowledge its harmful consequences.
1.3.2. Pro: It is not going to disappear any time soon; even if it was considered a problem, the normalisation will take decades to ebb back.
1.4. Con: Caffeine isn't as bad as other drugs, such as alcohol.
1.4.1. Pro: Caffeine does not have enough issues to declare it a problem. People do not die from caffeine compared to other drugs, like alcohol, for instance.
1.4.1.1. Con: It is rare, but possible, to die from a [caffeine overdose](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/a-real-life-death-by-caffeine).
1.4.2. Con: Caffeine is an alkaloid chemical compound. Other well known alkaloids are nicotine, cocaine and morphine. It is not so harmless as many think.
1.4.2.1. Con: At a far reduced intensity. To try and reasonably compare them is absurd.
1.5. Pro: Caffeine is consumed by many people, thus making its effects more important to handle.
1.5.1. Pro: [Around 90%](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/studentlife/health/promotion/goto/resources/drugs/caffeine.html) of Americans ingest caffeine daily.
1.5.2. Con: The same could be said of alcohol, which is far more damaging, and equally unhandled; there is no reason to focus on caffeine as a major problem.
1.5.3. Pro: Its sheer prevalence means it should be subject to more scrutiny, to assess whether it has more negative repercussions than previously considered.
1.6. Con: Caffeine has many benefits, such as focus, acuity, energy, and heart health later in life.
1.6.1. Con: These are short-term, and increasingly large quantities are needed to get the same effects for regular users.
1.7. Pro: Caffeine is addictive, and therefore users cannot think clearly about when to take it and when not to.
1.7.1. Pro: Caffeine withdrawal can cause serious problems.
1.7.1.1. Pro: It is recognised in the [DSM-5 as a disorder](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-withdrawal-symptoms-top-ten).
1.7.1.2. Pro: [Withdrawal symptoms](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/caffeine-withdrawal-symptoms) range from headaches to fatigue to anxiety and depression; it is a serious problem for those suffering.
1.7.1.3. Con: Withdrawal is [reasonably quick](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-withdrawal-symptoms-top-ten), with even heavy users only needing a week or so to get over the worst symptoms.
1.7.2. Pro: Due to a [failure in labelling caffeine content](http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/28/health/la-he-nutrition28-2009dec28), consumers are not always able to avoid caffeine. Because this creates a nationwide issue, we need treatment options \(like centers\) to handle large-scale incoming addictions surrounding the misinterpretations of caffeine content.
1.8. Pro: Caffeine causes [long term sleep problems](https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/caffeine-and-sleep) by messing with adenosine reception.
