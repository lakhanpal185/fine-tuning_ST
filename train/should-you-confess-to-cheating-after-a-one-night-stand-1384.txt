Discussion Title: Should You Confess to Cheating After a One Night Stand?

1. In an exclusive relationship, should you reveal a one-night stand to your partner?
1.1. Pro: Intimate relationships are built on trust, and cheating is a breach of trust. By not telling your partner about it, that trust will be further eroded, whereas telling your partner allows you to begin to rebuild it.
1.1.1. Pro: Research [indicates](http://www.marquette.edu/psyc/documents/GundersonFerrari2008ForgivenessofSexualCheating.pdf) that a confession and apology can result in the cheated-upon partner being willing "to forgive, regain trust, and reconcile the relationship", and more so than in the absence of a confession and apology.
1.1.1.1. Pro: [Apologies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2926625) are helpful in softening negative attitudes toward an offender and in reducing urges to aggressively retaliate.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: This is a reason to apologise when a partner discovers the infidelity, not necessarily to confess in the first place.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: An apology in the form of a confession is probably more effective and credible than an apology made only after the affair has been discovered.
1.1.1.2. Con: While the likelihood of forgiveness is higher with a confession than without, the same study found that the gap is not very big. In both cases the likelihood of break up is two to three times as high as forgiveness \([Gunderson and Ferrari, p. 9](http://www.marquette.edu/psyc/documents/GundersonFerrari2008ForgivenessofSexualCheating.pdf)\).
1.1.2. Pro: Being in an exclusive relationship means that you don't allow another individual to potentially jeopardize your relationship in any way. A one-night stand is considered cheating in an "exclusive" relationship which creates mistrust.
1.1.3. Pro: The primary breach of trust in the one night stand cannot be undone. The question is whether to compound the issue by committing a second breach. Hiding the issue implies there is more to the act than a one night stand. It adds layers of lies. Whether the relationship is strong enough to allow for forgiveness of the first is questionable but in the face of two acts seems for less probable.
1.1.4. Pro: If you have a one-night-stand you're not committed to the relationship and ought to get out. If you did it once you're likely to do it again and thus are not ready for a committed relationship.
1.1.5. Pro: Your partner will sense something is off anyway, so you may as well be honest. Also, once you cheat, you'll be paranoid the other will cheat as well. The only way to recover is through the long job of rebuilding mutual trust.
1.1.6. Pro: Communication in a couple is primordial for the welfare of the relationship. It helps to understand each other's needs and behaviours. It is then important to communicate about anything, including a one night stand.
1.1.7. Pro: Cheating is a violation of an \(implicit or explicit\) agreement between you and your partner. As such, they have the right to know the agreement has been breached.
1.1.8. Con: A confession can sow permanent doubt in the relationship.
1.1.8.1. Con: Doubt will likely not be permanent if measures to establish trust are taken.
1.1.8.2. Pro: The relationship should not exist in the first place. Whatever "relationship" there is is based on lies and will inevitably lead to disaster.
1.1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.8.4. Pro: Telling one's partner can cause permanent harm and, for example, make him/her less trusting and more insecure in this and future relationships.
1.1.8.4.1. Con: Them finding out from someone else has an amplified ability to do that.
1.1.8.5. Pro: Couples aware of infidelity exhibit greater marital instability, dishonesty, arguments about trust, narcissism, and time spent apart \([Atkins et al., p. 472](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/fam/19/3/470/)\).
1.1.8.5.1. Con: The sample selection of the study is biased as it draws from couples already seeking marital therapy.
1.1.8.5.2. Con: This appears to be in comparison to couples with no infidelity, and so it is not clear whether infidelity is the cause of that state, or the result of it.
1.1.9. Con: Without a confession the partner is given no reason to call the trust into question. Trust only gets destroyed by confessing.
1.1.9.1. Con: The cheating is itself a breach of that trust. Even if one's partner is unaware, it will taint the relationship.
1.1.9.2. Con: The harm to the relationship was done through the act of cheating; the confession merely puts it out in the open.
1.1.10. Pro: Disclosure by the involved partner seems to better facilitate relationship recovery compared to a one-night stand being admitted only after repeated denials \([Allen et al, p. 119](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/clipsy.bpi014/full)\).
1.1.10.1. Con: A later discovery does not necessarily have to occur after repeated denials.
1.1.10.1.1. Con: It is in many ways just as bad if it occurs after successfully entirely covering up the infidelity, as your partner will no longer trust their emotions and interpretations of your actions.
1.1.10.2. Con: At a later stage, if this was a one off, there would be a demonstrated period of fidelity which may be reassuring if believed by the partner.
1.1.10.2.1. Con: If the one-night stand comes to light at a later stage, there is little reason for the partner to assume that no other affairs ever took place. After all, the cheating partner has already demonstrated his/her willingness to hide one-night stands.
1.1.10.2.2. Con: There is also a demonstrated period of deceit, which is hardly likely to inspire feelings of trust and fidelity.
1.1.11. Pro: Being honest about your breach of trust is, itself, an act of trust, beginning the process of rebuilding the foundation of the relationship.
1.1.11.1. Pro: This act of honesty may be seen as an attempt to save the relationship, making the person who was cheated on more willing to hear their partners’ explanations.
1.1.11.2. Pro: Apologizing implies that one recognizes and regrets an offence, indicating willingness to mend the damage done to the relationship.
1.1.11.2.1. Pro: Sincere apologies can show remorse and how much one values the relationship despite making a mistake. They can provide the motivation to want to save the relationship.
1.1.11.2.1.1. Pro: We are all human and should be allowed to make mistakes; if one partner is brave enough to own up to their mistake, the other should listen and try to forgive them.
1.1.11.2.1.2. Pro: Apologies can compensate for the level of hurt experienced, making forgiveness easier.
1.1.11.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.11.2.2. Con: Apologies are often made for personal gains without showing signs of sincere remorse.
1.2. Con: Revealing it has a high likelihood of ending the relationship.
1.2.1. Pro: It is estimated that around half \(or more\) of the married couples that experience infidelity get a divorce \([Allen/Atkins, p. 1487](http://The Association of Divorce and Extramarital Sex in a Representative U.S. Sample)\).
1.2.1.1. Pro: 50% is a relatively high chance of divorce or separation. Most people would not want to take a 50/50 gamble with a relationship they care about if they can avoid it.
1.2.2. Con: This is a positive thing given the relationship is based on lies. In a healthy relationship one would talk things through and maybe find a new agreement or set of rules.
1.2.3. Con: Revealing it allows a partner to choose between continuing or ending the relationship. It gives back the power of decision to the cheated-upon partner, which was initially denied when one-night stand was committed.
1.2.4. Pro: Even if there will be no significant consequences on the relationship following the one night stand, it might be a symptom of some kind of insecurities inside the couple. Revealing would probably be harmful and cause the partner a lot of pain and distrust, while seeking the help of a therapist might help the “cheater” understand what caused the event and if something can be done to improve the relationship.
1.2.5. Con: If the confession ends the relationship, this is your responsibility. This is a risk you take when you cheat.
1.2.5.1. Con: The risk is attached to the question of confession or not and not to the decision to cheat.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: The fact that the confession is the immediate action does not mean that it is what carries the risk. Your partner is unlikely to leave you for honesty - what carries the risk of ending the relationship is the breach of trust itself.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: Not revealing it has no negative effects on the relationship.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: The only reason to reveal is to assuage your own guilt. People should keep what they've done to themselves.
1.2.5.1.2.2. Pro: Concealing the cheating is not the disrespectful part; the actual act was. While honesty is generally important in a relationship, people would react differently to the news and their significant others can best judge whether they would be better or worse-off for knowing.
1.2.5.1.2.3. Con: Not revealing it deprives both parties from entering into an open relationship \(with multiple partners\). This arguably might be a more suitable and happy arrangement than an exclusive relationship.
1.2.5.1.2.4. Pro: A guilty conscience is expressed in extra attentiveness, buying of gifts or extra confessions of love. This will change the relationship for the better.
1.2.5.1.2.4.1. Con: Extra attentiveness can make the partner suspicious and make him/her want to find out if there is something going on.
1.2.5.1.2.4.2. Con: Guilt can also express itself in a wide range of other ways, including [nervousness and depression](http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/is-guilt-getting-best-of-you?page=2), that - particularly when unexplained to the partner - can damage the relationship.
1.2.5.1.2.5. Con: The silence encourages the cheater's behavior as there is no punishment.
1.2.5.1.2.5.1. Pro: The assumption that people continue with certain behaviors unless there is punishment is prevalent and underpins the laws and justice systems of all societies.
1.2.5.1.2.5.2. Pro: For many people, not confessing will make the relationship feel tainted and thus increase the likelihood that any future slip-ups will not be perceived as very serious.
1.2.5.1.2.5.3. Pro: A [large-scale study](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/cheating-study_n_5680250.html) indicates that people who cheat in a relationship are more likely to cheat in their next relationship, too, than people who did not cheat before.
1.2.5.1.2.5.3.1. Con: This result can be interpreted as saying that some people cheat once per relationship - and never again until they are in a relationship with a new partner.
1.2.5.1.2.5.3.1.1. Con: This would be a fairly odd interpretation of the results - there is no evidence in the study that cheating individuals were following such a rule.
1.2.5.1.2.5.4. Con: The cheater is still aware of the fact that getting caught would come with a punishment, otherwise there would be no reason to hide the cheating in the first place.
1.2.5.1.2.5.5. Con: Cheating is not a [rational](https://www.truthaboutdeception.com/cheating-and-infidelity/why-people-cheat/decision-to-cheat.html) choice but based on emotions.
1.2.5.1.2.5.5.1. Con: All choices are irrational and based on some emotions to some extent. Should I not be held accountable for my irrational choices?
1.2.5.1.2.5.5.2. Con: There are enough people that are capable of saying no to temptation.
1.2.5.1.2.5.6. Pro: Cheating without punishment can lead to a pattern of cheating, by normalising and minimalising the breaches. People adopting such an attitude are likely to continue to classify future transgressions as "just a one-off", long past the point where it becomes a pattern.
1.2.5.1.2.6. Con: The cheating partner has the potential to be stricken by feelings of guilt that will weigh heavy on his/her conscience.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1. Pro: Revealing it relieves feelings of guilt.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.1. Con: Admitting only has advantages for the cheater. They will get it of their chest and feel immediate relief. But, from that moment, the burden will be on their partner.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.2. Con: If sincere remorse exists, the conscientious individual deserves the burden of guilt and should not relieve it by revealing the affair.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.2.1. Con: It is plausible that those who initially have sincere remorse, may create internal excuses, or justifications for cheating in order to not be overwhelmed from feelings of intense remorse that only increases with time. This would enable the adulterer to escape the feeling of guilt.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Plausibility is hypothetical and should not play into ethics. If such an individual begins to make internal excuses or justifications to ease the remorse they intended to punish themselves with, the initial premise of intentionally doing it to feel guilt no longer holds true; thus, their rational for not telling in the first place dissipates.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.3. Con: In an exclusive relationship you can hardly consider something a relief if it upsets your partner.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.3.1. Pro: Partners form shared goals in a relationship. Causing emotional harm to your partner hurts the own ability to achieve these goals and therefore makes oneself worse off.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.3.2. Pro: To shift the emotional burden of one's action onto one's partner is immoral.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.4. Pro: Living with that guilt - and possibly, with the need to maintain a lie - can destroy a relationship that would survive the admission of cheating.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.5. Con: Feeling guilty can be the lesser of two evils, for example if the alternative would be a breakup of the relationship.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.5.1. Con: Certain people value honesty as an essential part of their character. For them it is worth risking a relationship for telling the truth.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.5.1.1. Con: These people rank their own impulse to be honest higher than the protection of the partner from harm. In the end it is simply egoistic.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.6. Con: After making a confession, the cheating partner feels strong guilt \([Brown, p. 82](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=de&lr=&id=PD6LIuaXcJsC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Patterns+of+infidelity+and+their+treatment&ots=eurjLCs2sQ&sig=RNfIH0H8wHtkIFPDlU_umMe1ru4&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=guilt&f=false)\).
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.6.1. Con: This does not mean that guilt is not reduced in the longer term.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.7. Con: Not everybody feels guilty after cheating.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.7.1. Pro: According to [one study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498309551167) \(p. 34\), two thirds of men and 40% of women who had cheated felt no or only a little guilt afterwards.
1.2.5.1.2.6.1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.6.1.6.
1.2.5.1.2.6.2. Pro: These feelings can, in turn, also cause damage to the relationship.
1.2.5.1.2.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.4.2.
1.2.5.1.2.6.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.6.1.7.1.
1.2.5.1.2.6.4. Pro: Guilt can even weaken the [immune system](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/guilty-conscience-can-damage-your-immune-system-280551.html).
1.2.5.1.2.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.4.2.
1.2.5.1.2.6.6. Pro: [Frequent](http://greatist.com/grow/truth-about-lying) lies can increase guilt and anxiety; which can lead to depression and, in many cases, paranoia over being found out.
1.2.5.1.2.7. Pro: Infidelity in itself can increase the happiness in the relationship by providing an outlet for an unhappy sex life.
1.2.5.1.2.7.1. Pro: Many partners engage in affairs because they are sexually unsatisfied.
1.2.5.1.2.7.1.1. Pro: Men who had affairs were significantly more sexually dissatisfied in their marriages compared with women \([Atkins et al., p. 472](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/fam/19/3/470/)\).
1.2.5.1.2.7.1.2. Con: There is evidence that a propensity to sexual infidelity is heritable. Thus, it cannot simply be blamed on sexual dissatisfaction \([Cherkas et al.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/genetic-influences-on-female-infidelity-and-number-of-sexual-partners-in-humans-a-linkage-and-association-study-of-the-role-of-the-vasopressin-receptor-gene-avpr1a/CD90C401AB01263A4205D6E926A914F8)\).
1.2.5.1.2.7.1.2.1. Pro: There is [ample](http://ideas.ted.com/10-facts-about-infidelity-helen-fisher/) [evidence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/pura-vida/201603/people-are-polygynous) that humans are not wired for monogamy, meaning that some infidelity will occur no matter what, even if all relationships are strong.
1.2.5.1.2.7.1.2.1.1. Con: Even if humans are not wired for monogamy, society built the idea that love is just between two people, making it harder for people to recognize the existence of polyamory.
1.2.5.1.2.7.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: These people might not consider non-monogamous relationships because of the social [stigma](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2012.01286.x/abstract) attached to it, not because they are opposed to the concept as such.
1.2.5.1.2.7.2. Con: Alternatively, sex outside of an unhappy marriage can reinforce dissatisfaction with the relationship as it comes - in relative terms - without the burdens and responsibilities of a serious relationship.
1.2.5.1.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.5.
1.2.5.1.2.9. Con: One night stands can cause [depression](http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/love-sex/relationships/a20933/could-a-one-night-stand-really-make-you-depressed/). This negative feeling will burden the relationship.
1.2.5.1.2.9.1. Con: The [study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2013.772088?journalCode=hjsr20) used to illustrate this link speaks of casual sex rather than one-night stands and is only applicable to 'emerging adults'.
1.2.5.1.2.10. Con: [A study](http://psp.sagepub.com/content/36/2/187) shows that keeping secrets can bar intimacy, which makes one less engaged and less satisfied with the relationship.
1.2.5.1.2.11. Pro: If the cheating partner feels no guilt the partnership is not affected emotionally. A confession, on the other hand, would do harm to the relationship.
1.2.5.1.2.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.6.1.7.1.
1.2.5.1.2.11.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.5.
1.2.5.1.2.12. Con: While not confessing has no negative effects on the relationship at the moment, it does have the possibility to become worse and create stress from guilt on the cheater. [Guilt can cause various unhealthy and negative impacts](http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/is-guilt-getting-best-of-you), so not telling does not mean the cheater will be in a positive state.
1.2.6. Pro: If confessing will end a relationship that is otherwise beneficial for both you and your partner, then you will be depriving both of you of a good that you would both otherwise have.
1.2.6.1. Con: By withholding this information from the cheated-upon partner, they are deprived of the right to make an informed, autonomous decision. This is patronizing.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: The partner might prefer the emotional harm of knowing they are being lied to.
1.2.6.1.2. Con: In close relationships, parties rely on and trust each other to look out for each others' interests. Cheating does not eradicate that, and in many relationships, the cheating partner may well be in a position to determine that their partner would prefer not to know.
1.2.6.1.2.1. Con: In close relationships the partners might feel more confident that they know about each other but it has been [shown](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/73/4/747/) that people lack accuracy in predicting their partner's preferences.
1.2.6.1.3. Pro: Having more information allows your partner to make better decisions for the future.
1.2.6.1.4. Con: The anger about cheating can lead to decisions in the heat of the moment and driven by emotions that might later be regretted.
1.2.6.1.4.1. Con: Because anger is quite common in relationships the partners learn to handle it.
1.2.6.1.4.1.1. Con: A cheated-upon partner may have no desire to handle the anger, but just pour out frustration.
1.2.6.1.4.1.2. Con: Anger is quite common in many situations in life, yet many people never learn to control it in the heat of the moment.
1.2.6.1.4.1.3. Pro: Partners learn to delay important decisions until anger has settled down and they can act more rationally.
1.2.6.1.4.2. Con: Anger is not constant and reduces over time \([Beck, p. 225](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1023063201318)\). This allows for informed decision making later.
1.2.6.1.4.3. Pro: Anger has been identified as a significant obstacle to informed decision making in other [situations](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/536442). After a confession this can obstruct proper assessment.
1.2.6.1.4.4. Pro: Anger about [completely different situations](https://hbr.org/2010/09/how-anger-poisons-decision-making) influences decision-making every day. This shows how anger can prevent informed choices.
1.2.6.1.4.4.1. Con: There are probably few situations that can compare with being told about an affair, in terms of the emotions caused.
1.2.6.1.5. Con: Some partners might prefer the emotional safety of not knowing what happened.
1.2.6.1.5.1. Con: Despite how some may feel upon learning the truth, it is still patronizing to withhold information.
1.2.6.2. Con: If you decided to cheat in the first place, you probably do not value your commitment to the relationship enough for it to be worth continuing. Therefore, the relationship ending might not be a bad thing.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.5.5.
1.2.6.2.2. Con: Many people stay in a relationship even though they cheated. For them it is clearly worth it to continue.
1.2.7. Pro: [Research](http://www.divorce.usu.edu/files/uploads/lesson3.pdf) on marriages suggests that infidelity was a major factor in more than half of all divorces and that it doubles the chance of a couple getting divorced.
1.2.7.1. Con: Divorce may be the least bad option if a marriage has deteriorated to the point of infidelity.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Infidelity ranks [highest](http://jfi.sagepub.com/content/24/5/602) as a reported reason for divorce.
1.2.7.3. Con: Compared to an upfront confession, hiding the infidelity may make the divorce an even more likely outcome if your partner does eventually find out, as it adds an element of ongoing dishonesty.
1.2.7.3.1. Pro: Meaningful relationships are based on transparency and honesty. The longer you hold on to the secret, the more betrayed your partner will feel when they eventually find out.
1.2.7.3.1.1. Con: It is by no means inevitable that the partner will eventually find out about the affair.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1. Con: While not inevitable the chances are there that the partner will find out. This needs to be taken into consideration.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Men perform [oral sex](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886912005764) to gather information about their partner’s recent sexual history by tasting if there was recent other sperm.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This seems to be a very speculative study, that did not actually ask men why they performed oral sex, but merely noted a correlation between performing it and being in less committed relationships. There are many possible reasons for that correlation.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: For example, men open to and engaged in more open relationships may be more open to a more diverse range of sexual practices.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: For example, men and women open to and engaged in more open relationships may be more comfortable insisting on their own pleasure in sexual interactions.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: For example, men who want commitment in relationships but have not yet reached that point of agreement with their partner may be more inclined to focus on their partner's pleasure.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: The damage done if one's partner finds out is sufficiently great that the risk should not be taken.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2.2. Con: A breakup as a result of a confession is not inevitable. There are good reasons for the partner to continue the relationship even though the partner cheated.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Fear of losing what was built together is a strong motive for people to stay despite betrayal.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Many people stay because they have nowhere else to go.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: The precarious situation of one's partner should not be used to justify the decision of whether or not to confess.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.2.1.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2.3. Con: As there are no studies on what someone can do to discover an unfaithful partner \([Allen et al., p. 118](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/2cc385d/_Lib_Proxy_Url/onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/clipsy.bpi014/epdf)\), there are no clues on the likelihood of detection. This makes it impossible to take them thoroughly into consideration.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2.3.
1.2.7.3.1.2. Pro: The feeling of betrayal is reinforced by a feeling that expected behavior, namely a confession, was not put forward.
1.2.7.3.1.2.1. Pro: Some people might get more upset about the lying and the deception than about the cheating.
1.2.7.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: A one-night stand can be seen as a lapse in judgement that can be forgiven, however lying about it over a sustained period of time means making a continuos, active choice to betray the partners´ trust.
1.2.8. Con: -> See 1.2.6.2.
1.2.9. Con: As the mutual agreement to exclusivity was broken unilaterally by the partner who cheated, the partner who has been cheated upon deserves the opportunity to decide whether they want to continue the relationship under the new circumstances.
1.2.9.1. Con: No general recommendation about the best reaction to cheating can be given as the best course of action depends on the specific context of the individual relationship.
1.2.9.1.1. Pro: Upfront open communication on protocol after anticipated obstacles, e.g. cheating, benefits and strengthens a relationship.
1.2.9.1.2. Con: This is neither a con, nor a pro, and thus does not belong in the debate.
1.2.9.1.3. Pro: The damage a confession and a subsequent breakup can cause differs from relationship to relationship, for example based on the presence of children or the financial dependence of one partner on the other.
1.2.9.1.3.1. Pro: Only some relationships involve children, and this should therefore not be the basis for any generalizations about whether a confession is right.
1.2.9.1.3.1.1. Pro: While it might seem to be the right thing to do to confess. it can in all likelihood do far more harm than good. Breaking up the relationship you have and also if children are involved can lose one of their parents.
1.2.9.1.3.1.2. Con: A large proportion of married couples have children.
1.2.9.1.3.1.3. Con: Even if children are only a certain set of stakeholders, they are particularly important ones, and so should be weighted highly in determining the best general approach.
1.2.9.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Children are more emotionally vulnerable than adults.
1.2.9.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Children are still developing as people, and impacts on that at a young age can affect them for the rest of their lives.
1.2.9.1.3.2. Pro: In the case that the significant other is dependent on the partner who cheated, for example due to a serious disability, a confession can lead to a break-up and, thereby, to even more severe problems for the partner.
1.2.9.1.3.2.1. Con: Even a fully dependent partner has the right to make the decision about whether and how to continue a relationship after a case of infidelity. Preventing him or her from doing so is patronizing.
1.2.9.1.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2.2.2.
1.2.9.1.3.3. Con: This attitude has the potential to encourage affairs for partners who know that the cheated-on partner will not break up due to the high cost of this step.
1.2.9.1.4. Pro: The reactions to be expected from a confession can vary to a great deal from relationship to relationship.
1.2.9.1.4.1. Pro: A confession can provoke extreme reactions on the part of the cheated-upon partner, e.g. [crimes of passion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_of_passion).
1.2.9.1.4.1.1. Pro: According to [one study](http://www.columbia.edu/~tdp4/RGP2007.pdf), men especially who were cheated on show a propensity towards anger and violence targeted at the person the partner cheated with.
1.2.9.1.4.1.2. Pro: Most therapists believe that infidelity should not be disclosed if there is domestic violence \([Allen et al., p. 119](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/clipsy.bpi014/full)\).
1.2.9.1.4.1.2.1. Con: Only some relationships involve a violent or potentially violent partner, and this therefore should not be the basis for any generalisations about whether a confession is right.
1.2.9.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: The risk of violence is a particularly significant consequence, and so if drawing any generalities, the risk of violence - even if only to some people - should be considered particularly important.
1.2.9.1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: According to a study from 1989, about four in ten men perceive physical aggression towards a cheating partner as legitimate \([Arias and Johnson, p. 305](http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/4/3/298.abstract)\). The share among women is two out of ten.
1.2.9.1.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.4.1.2.1.
1.2.9.1.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.4.1.2.1.1.1.
1.2.9.1.4.1.5. Pro: In response to the perceived threat that a woman's infidelity can pose to their dominance, men may engage in [violent](http://evp.sagepub.com/content/6/3/147470490800600305.full.pdf) behaviors as a way to offset that threat. Men's perception of their status often depends on their sense of dominance and violence is a typical way for men to assert this dominance.
1.2.9.1.4.1.5.1. Con: To suggest that a woman should change her behavior because of her male partner's possible propensity for violence is to hold her causally responsible for his unacceptable behavior.
1.2.9.1.4.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.4.1.2.1.1.
1.2.9.1.5. Con: At the core, all cases of cheating are identical, even though their specific contexts may differ: the commitment to exclusivity was broken by the cheater.
1.2.9.1.5.1. Con: As is evident in judicial systems, societies generally take into account extenuating circumstances when determining how to respond to the misbehavior of individuals. Just like not all crimes deserve the identical response, so should responses to cheating take into account  extenuating circumstances.
1.2.9.1.5.1.1. Con: Most sentencing systems include mandatory minimum sentences, that often do not take such extenuating circumstances into account; one infamous example is mandatory minimum sentences in the United States' "War on Drugs" that have been [heavily criticized](http://famm.org/sentencing-101/the-facts/) for their uniform response to a variety of criminal offenses.
1.2.9.1.5.2. Pro: Assuming that not all cases of cheating are intrinsically the same would encourage cheating under circumstances that make the act less egregious.
1.2.9.1.6. Pro: The best course of action depends on the expectations that a partner who cheated has towards himself/herself. These differ from person to person.
1.2.9.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.6.1.5.1.
1.2.9.1.6.2. Con: The decision whether to confess a one-night stand should not only be driven by considerations about how oneself would perceive the outcome, but also by considerations about how one's partner would perceive the outcome. Relationships, after all, are about two people.
1.2.9.1.6.3. Pro: The guilt felt in response to cheating differs from person to person. As [one study](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/ceb77fd/_Lib_Proxy_Url/www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00224498309551167?needAccess=true) \(p. 34\) shows, almost 40% of the female respondents felt "very guilty", whereas only about 10% of the male respondents has the same reaction.
1.2.9.1.7. Con: The line of reasoning that a confession of infidelity should depend on the circumstances implicitly encourages affairs and their cover-up as lying to one's partner is morally justified via reference to a greater good.
1.2.9.2. Pro: It could be in the interest of the other party that the relationship is ended. For example, the other party may have a wish to be exclusively in monogamous relationships. Withholding information will lead to the wish of the other party being unfulfillable.
1.2.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.2.9.4. Pro: If aware of the infidelity, the assessment of the mutual agreement will change. Withholding the opportunity to review it would breach this agreement between two partners as it would unilaterally changes its terms.
1.2.10. Con: -> See 1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2.2.
1.2.11. Con: A [study](http://www.marquette.edu/psyc/documents/GundersonFerrari2008ForgivenessofSexualCheating.pdf) suggests that the likelihood of a breakup is strongly correlated with the quality of the relationship and the commitment to it. If the partner does choose to break up, it is most likely not only because of the cheating.
1.2.11.1. Pro: A partner is much more likely to forgive the cheating if the relationship was satisfying previously. [\(Gunderson, Ferrari, p. 2\)](http://www.marquette.edu/psyc/documents/GundersonFerrari2008ForgivenessofSexualCheating.pdf)
1.2.11.1.1. Pro: A partner who was committed to and satisfied with the relationship is more likely to empathize and identify extenuating circumstances, making forgiveness easier. [\(Gunderson, Ferrari, p. 2\)](http://www.marquette.edu/psyc/documents/GundersonFerrari2008ForgivenessofSexualCheating.pdf)
1.2.11.2. Pro: People less committed to their partners are likely to use their partner's infidelity as an attempt to withdraw from the relationship.[\(Gunderson, Ferrari, p. 2\)](http://www.marquette.edu/psyc/documents/GundersonFerrari2008ForgivenessofSexualCheating.pdf)
1.2.11.3. Con: More often than not cheating and a low quality of the relationship cannot easily be separated. According to [one study](http://snu-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?frbrVersion=7&tabs=viewOnlineTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=TN_tayfranc10.1080%2f00224498309551167&indx=1&recIds=TN_tayfranc10.1080%2f00224498309551167&recIdxs=0&elementId=0&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=7&frbg=&&dscnt=0&scp.scps=scope%3A%2882SNU_SSPACE%29%2Cscope%3A%2882SNU_INST%29%2Cscope%3A%2882SNU_COURSE%29%2Cscope%3A%2882SNU_ROSETTA%29%2Cprimo_central_multiple_fe&tb=t&mode=Basic&vid=82SNU&srt=rank&tab=all&dum=true&vl\(freeText0\)=Marital%20separation%20and%20extramarital%20sexual%20behavior&dstmp=1479643876358) \(p. 35\), half of those who were cheated on by their partner saw this infidelity as the cause of marital problems.
1.3. Pro: Revealing it enhances the long-term stability of a relationship.
1.3.1. Pro: Confessions of infidelity can lead to a better relationship by forcing examination and discussion, for example about sexual satisfaction.
1.3.1.1. Con: One [study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498309551167) indicates that people who have affairs tend to see their own affairs as the result of relationship problems, whereas they see the partner's affairs as the cause of relationship problems. A confession might therefore not help to solve problems as the partner might rather see cheating as a cause rather than a result of these problems.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The norms against infidelity are oftentimes applied hypocritically. Illustratively, partners who both had affairs see their partner's affair as [more damaging](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3812143?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) \(p. 388f.\) to the relationship than their own.
1.3.1.2. Con: Many relationships are already strong and healthy even if one partner had a spontaneous one-night stand.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Relationship expert and psychotherapist Esther Perel's only clients are those involved in affairs, she argues the majority of them are ["content" in their relationships](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/03/esther_perel_on_affairs_spouses_in_happy_marriages_cheat_and_americans_don.html). This leads her to believe that most people do not cheat because they're unhappy but because they "could be happier."
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: This is not a very scientific claim - there is selection bias, as she is seeing only those clients likely to go to a therapist who describes herself as a ['sexual healer'](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/03/esther_perel_on_affairs_spouses_in_happy_marriages_cheat_and_americans_don.html), and is best known for a series of books condemning American attitudes towards monogamous marriage and affairs as ['priggish and provincial'](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/03/esther_perel_on_affairs_spouses_in_happy_marriages_cheat_and_americans_don.html).
1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Given her profile, career and opinions, she also has incentives to fit her assessments of her clients' average opinions and feelings to the narrative she seeks to create around sex, marriage and sexuality.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: [Various](http://spr.sagepub.com/content/22/3/339.short) [studies](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01494929.2010.528707) [indicate](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498309551167) that common reasons for infidelity are feelings of dissatisfaction and neglect in the relationship, more so than sexual desire or the excitement of risk.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.7.1.
1.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.3.
1.3.1.4. Con: Studies show that the majority of partners who were cheated upon [think that](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/b654727/_Lib_Proxy_Url/www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3812143.pdf) this hurt the relationship somewhat or to a great deal, and that only [few relationships](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7643421) experience growth or improvement as a result of cheating.
1.3.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.2.
1.3.1.7. Pro: If underlying dissatisfaction with the state of the relationship has contributed to cheating, the confession can act as a wakeup call to one's partner about problems that they may be ignoring or perpetuating.
1.3.1.8. Pro: Some couples might be happiest in a semi-monogamous relationship; cheating might enable partners to consider this as an option.
1.3.1.8.1. Pro: Extramarital involvement frequently results in considerable distress both to participants and their spouses. A confession can transform the relationship into an open one and make everything less stressful \([Allen et al., p.102\)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/clipsy.bpi014/full).
1.3.1.8.2. Con: Even if this is the case, starting that conversation in the context of a breach of trust is unlikely to get a positive and open reaction from your partner.
1.3.1.8.2.1. Pro: Non-monogamous relationships are built on mutual trust to work. Cheating erodes this foundation.
1.3.1.8.3. Con: According to a [poll by YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/news/2015/03/20/poll-results-open-relationships/), the overwhelming majority of US adults would never consider being in an open relationship.
1.3.1.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.7.1.2.1.1.1.
1.3.1.8.4. Con: A couple turning to a non-monogamous relationship works extremely [rarely](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201601/when-your-partner-wants-non-monogamy-and-you-don-t) to improve and save the marriage.
1.3.1.9. Con: The distrust created by the knowledge of infidelity hinders effective communication and therefore close examination of relationship problems \([Hertlein et al., p.8](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J398v04n02_02?journalCode=wcrt20)\).
1.3.2. Pro: By telling your partner about it you take responsibility, can show remorse and can actively try to move forward by rebuilding trust.
1.3.2.1. Con: Without a confession there is no necessity to show responsibility or remorse and no need to re-build trust.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Taking responsibility for your actions makes you feel honest and hence more confident in being in a healthy exclusive relationship.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: Your partner is not the only one who benefits from these things. Taking responsibility can help you make better choices - such as not cheating - in the future, and rebuilding trust can improve your relationship in general.
1.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.
1.3.4. Con: A confession makes it more likely that the partner cheats as revenge. This hurts the partner who cheated in the first place.
1.3.4.1. Con: It is only just if the cheated-on partner takes revenge.
1.3.4.2. Con: According to [one study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3812938?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), revenge is commonly not seen among the justifications that people give for cheating; in another study, [only 3%](http://search.proquest.com/openview/df3411879cbddd41845fe57f93acc2d3/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1819054) of participants name revenge as a reaction to their partner's infidelity.
1.3.4.3. Pro: A [study](http://www.markbeaird.org/wmlib/pdf/book_resources_rbt/betrayal_rejection_revenge_and_forgiveness.pdf) found that students think about sexual retaliation as tool for revenge.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: When a person is hurt, thinking about revenge is a normal reaction. This does not mean that they will decide to act on these thoughts.
1.3.4.4. Con: Even though it would hurt the long stability of the relationship it is hypocritical to not confess out of fear that your partner will cheat just like you.
1.3.5. Con: A confession affects the relationship in a negative way by destroying trust and causing mental harm.
1.3.5.1. Pro: It can cause insecurity and anxiety for the partner, which is likely to destroy the relationship.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: Women who have experienced a partner's infidelity are more likely to suffer from [depression](http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0022-006X.68.5.774) during their lifetime.
1.3.6. Con: According to [one survey](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=1997-05658-009) conducted among couple therapists, with the exception of abuse, no other problem is as damaging to a relationship as an affair.
1.3.6.1. Con: This survey concerns all affairs, and not just one-night stands.
1.3.6.2. Con: This is about the damage of an affair, as opposed to the damage of a confession. Not all of that harm is caused by one's partner knowing about the affair - some, such as emotional distance, can arise even without that knowledge.
1.3.7. Con: -> See 1.1.8.
1.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.9. Con: -> See 1.1.8.5.
1.3.10. Con: Women show a propensity to react to infidelity by creating an [alliance network](http://evp.sagepub.com/content/6/3/147470490800600305.full.pdf), e.g. among friends, for shelter and food. This serves as insurance in case of a later break up and therefore reduces the costs of risky behavior, i.e. cheating with others or breaking up.
1.3.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.3.1.1.1.2.2.2.
1.3.10.2. Pro: Partners stay in a relationship because they cannot afford to break up. Having a support network can lower the hurdle, such as in this [example](http://thefinancialdiet.com/the-financial-confessions-im-staying-in-my-relationship-because-i-cant-afford-to-leave/).
1.3.10.3. Pro: In the UK [9%](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/12/one-in-ten-people-have-no-close-friends-relate) do not have a single close friend. For them it might be difficult to find outside support for the emotional arduous path of divorce.
1.3.10.4. Con: Many women have friends. Having friends is not a sufficient condition for someone to end a relationship - there need to be other underlying problems, in most cases, for that to occur.
1.3.10.5. Con: If the relationship is so weak that having an insurance system is enough for someone to treat it with little regard, it was not likely to survive anyway.
1.3.10.6. Con: A support network can equally give someone the strength and support necessary to work through hard longterm problems, making them more likely to stay in the relationship.
1.3.10.7. Con: If the continuation of your relationship is dependent on your partner having few other options, your relationship is harmful for your partner. If you care about them, you should give them whatever push or support they need to create a healthier support network, even if that results in them leaving you.
1.3.11. Pro: When your partner is aware of your infidelity, they can help you avoid acting on such desires in the future, strengthening your relationship.
1.3.11.1. Con: It is questionable whether this outcome actually improves the relationship as it would be based on control and verification instead of trust.
1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.
1.5. Con: If you cheated once, you might do so again. Given this, revealing makes future cheating more difficult because your partner will be more suspicious in future.
1.5.1. Pro: According to [one study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498309551167), 90% of men and 83% of women who had an extramarital affair in the past found it to be satisfactory or somewhat satisfactory.
1.5.2. Pro: Getting away with cheating can give a sense of being 'above the law,' almost [giving a high effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24000799). This can make it rewarding to do it again and continue the high, compromising the relationship.
1.5.3. Con: If you are prone to moments of weakness, making future cheating more difficult should be seen as a good thing.
1.5.3.1. Con: Cheating is not only done out of weakness.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: People cheat to try different forms of interpersonal relationships.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: People cheat because one partner doesn't fulfill all of their needs.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: Humans are inherently imperfect. Finding one that matches all qualities is extremely difficult if not impossible.
1.5.3.1.3. Pro: Some people just like to have sex with many other partners.
1.5.3.1.4. Pro: A sense of exploration can drive cheating. After all, every body is different and new.
1.5.4. Pro: Reconciliation enables a conscientious individual to commit the act again. A lasting impact, e.g., the growing burden of [guilt](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1384.1097), is necessary to reinforce prevention of repeat offenses.
1.5.5. Con: If you want to continue having multiple sexual partners, it is morally better that you are not in a committed exclusive relationship in the first place.
1.5.5.1. Con: Cheating causes less harm than serial-monogamy.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Serial monogamy involves many sucessive break-ups that causes pain and suffering.
1.5.5.1.2. Pro: In cheating you have a 50%-50% chance of make people suffer \(Get Caught X Don't Get Caught\), while in the serial monogamy, in each break-up you have 100% of chance of causing pain and sadness.
1.5.5.2. Pro: The premise of an exclusive relationship is the commitment you make to your partner. If you are unwilling to make that commitment, you should not enter into a relationship based on that commitment.
1.5.5.3. Pro: Given that your partner expects faithfulness from you, continuing to cheat will hurt them deeply.
1.5.5.3.1. Pro: Causing harm to others for ones' own pleasure is immoral.
1.5.5.3.2. Pro: When in a close relationship of trust and confidence, you owe a duty to your partner not to deliberately cause them harm.
1.5.5.3.2.1. Con: The cheated-upon partner is not harmed as long as they do not know about the one-night stand. The affair alone is thus not sufficient to harm them.
1.5.5.3.2.1.1. Con: This assumes that your partner will never find out about the infidelity and your deceit.
1.5.5.3.2.1.2. Con: People can be harmed without knowing it or knowing why.
1.5.5.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: By keeping this secret, you leave your partner with no knowledge of why your behaviour may have changed - e.g. why you are acting secretive.
1.5.5.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: By keeping this secret from your partner when others may know it, you may be opening your partner up to ridicule or judgement by others.
1.5.5.3.2.1.2.3. Pro: Normalising your own infidelity by avoiding consequences makes it more likely that you will repeat the behaviour, causing further harm to your partner.
1.5.5.3.2.1.2.4. Pro: Even if [protection was used](http://www.self.com/story/these-are-the-stds-that-condoms-dont-protect-against), one-night stands still have a non-neglible risk of sexually transmitted infections that could harm your significant other and mean they should be informed.
1.5.5.3.2.1.2.4.1. Con: After a one-night stand, the cheating partner could get tested for STIs. If it turns out they have not caught an STI, then there is no risk.
1.5.5.3.2.1.2.4.1.1. Con: The results of STI tests usually take several days to arrive. Your partner might get infected in the meantime.
1.5.5.3.2.1.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: For a reliable [HIV test](https://smartsexresource.com/health-providers/blog/201308/understanding-window-periods-hiv-tests), one normally needs to wait at least several weeks.
1.5.5.3.2.1.2.4.1.2. Con: Not all STIs are immediately visible. Thus, the cheating partner might inaccurately believe that they are not infected.
1.5.5.3.2.1.2.4.2. Pro: Recent research suggests that the correct use of condoms can protect from HIV/AIDS only around [80%](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/18798401) of the time.
1.5.5.3.2.1.2.4.3. Pro: Condoms [cannot](http://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/brief.html) protect from the transmission of certain STIs, such as herpes and syphilis, and offer no absolute protection from other STIs, mainly due to incorrect use or product failure.
1.5.5.3.2.1.3. Pro: A one-night stand can hardly come to light at a later stage. This is only likely to happen if you keep in touch with that person.
1.5.5.3.2.1.3.1. Con: Assuming that third parties are aware of the one-night stand or there is evidence \(e.g. communications and receipts\) that it took place, it can come to light even without staying in touch with the partner.
1.5.5.3.2.1.3.2. Con: Even if no-one else is aware of the one-night stand, the other party to the infidelity may feel guilty and confess.
1.5.5.3.2.1.3.3. Con: Even if no-one else is aware of it, you may in the future confess or let slip a detail that reveals the one-night stand.
1.5.5.3.2.1.3.4. Pro: Memory of the one-night stand slips slowly from memory.
1.5.5.3.2.1.3.5. Pro: The cheating partner will revert to a normal lifestyle that does not show any signs that a one-night stand has occurred.
1.5.5.3.2.1.3.6. Pro: Explanations for the signs that could indicate that a one-night stand happened, such as dropped calls or coming home late, are more convincing over time as they can be explained with gaps in memory due to the time that has passed.
1.5.5.3.2.1.3.7. Pro: Many of the signs that could indicate that a one-night stand happened, such as dropped calls or coming home late, will fade from memory as time passes. The chance of the affair coming to light thus decreases continuously.
1.5.5.3.2.1.3.7.1. Con: If a partner was worried by these signs, it is unlikely that they will be forgotten. It is likely that this will lead to [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) in the future, even related to anomalies that are not actually linked to any cheating.
1.5.5.3.3. Con: -> See 1.5.5.3.2.1.
1.5.5.4. Con: Being in an exclusive committed relationship \(while cheating at the same time\) is often the only way to extract emotional stability from the partner.
1.5.5.4.1. Pro: If you cheat first, it makes you less vulnerable to being hurt if you get cheated-on later.
1.5.5.4.1.1. Pro: The harm of cheating is in many ways the betrayal, or asymmetry, where one partner was doing something without the other's knowledge. If it turns out both partners were doing so that betrayal becomes more palatable as both people disregarded the 'rules' of the relationship.
1.5.5.4.2. Con: Emotional stability is not extracted from a partner, as successful relationships are more likely to occur when two stable individuals enter a relationship with realistic expectations.
1.5.5.4.3. Con: Your partner has entered into that emotional commitment expecting the same in return. It is a question of fairness, and it is unfair not to live up to that expectation and agreement.
1.5.5.4.4. Con: If an emotional commitment is valuable to you, you should be willing to make the commitments your partner expects in return.
1.5.6. Pro: A lot of partners lose their trust in the cheating partner \([Hertlein et al., p. 8](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J398v04n02_02?journalCode=wcrt20)\). This will lead to increased suspicion.
1.5.7. Con: If you want to continue having casual sex with multiple partners, you are probably personally better off not being in a committed, exclusive relationship.
1.5.7.1. Con: Being in a stable relationship while having one-night stands allows one to receive emotional stability through the relationship and sexual satisfaction with various partners at the same time.
1.5.7.1.1. Pro: When being able to have both it would make no sense to give up on one, so one is not better off as a single than in a relationship if more one-night stands are desired.
1.5.7.1.2. Con: These benefits for oneself are bought through the deception of the partner. In the sense of Immanuel Kant, his is immoral as it treats the partner as a [means to an end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_to_an_end).
1.5.7.2. Pro: If not in a committed relationship, you will not need to worry about hiding your flings from a partner.
1.5.7.3. Pro: If not in a committed relationship, you will have more time, money and focus to devote to pursuing opportunities for such casual sex.
1.5.7.4. Con: -> See 1.5.5.4.
1.5.7.5. Pro: In the long term, it is psychologically difficult to maintain repeated lies. Thus, at some point, you will need to choose between continued one night stands and the romantic relationship.
1.5.7.6. Pro: Maintaining a supposedly exclusive romantic relationship while also seeking out multiple sexual partners is logistically difficult.
1.6. Con: A one-night stand is not significant enough to warrant telling your partner.
1.6.1. Con: 'One-night stand' is a self-forgiving phrase. Nobody stumble into a vagina or phallus. Aside specific circumstances \(drugs or dead-drunk\) it is an educated decision between two adults. Therefore it is significant and hiding it is a second breach of trust.
1.6.2. Con: "Significant" is an arbitrary term defined in this instance by the perpetrator.
1.6.3. Pro: If the one-night stand was merely about having fun, it does not necessarily have any implications or consequences for the relationship.
1.6.3.1. Con: This is an egocentric perspective that ignores what is best for the relationship. It may be meaningless to oneself - but possibly have a lot of meaning for the partner who was cheated on.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: It will only become meaningful for the partner if confessed.
1.6.3.2. Con: It is irrelevant whether it was intended to be fun and casual, this is a serious breach of faith and trust. The confession does not change the nature of the incident, but merely admits to it.
1.6.4. Pro: Cheating is relatively common even in ostensibly exclusive relationships. This implies that the norm is compatible with minor indiscretions and that therefore informing your partner is not always necessary.
1.6.4.1. Pro: [58%](http://knowmore.washingtonpost.com/2014/01/07/how-your-breakup-is-going-to-go-in-one-chart/) of Turks have had an affair. This makes a single one-night stand pale in significance.
1.6.4.2. Con: This is a descriptive statement out of which no normative implications arise.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: On it's own it is true that this is a descriptive statement. However, insofar as it shows the discrepancy between the statement of a norm and its actual enactment, it lessens the normative force of the rule.
1.6.4.2.1.1. Pro: A [Dutch study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3813355?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) has shown that both the likelihood and the attitudes towards cheating change if one's peers cheat or do not perceive cheating as problematic.
1.6.4.3. Con: Commonality of an action does not make it unimportant. The question is less how common cheating is, and more how much of a breach of trust it is for those actually in the relationships in question.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Even if not backed up by data, this perception is wide-spread and thus relevant. In 2001, two thirds of Americans [believed](http://www.gallup.com/poll/4591/Americans-Consider-Infidelity-Wrong-Acknowledge-its-Prevalence-Society.aspx?g_source=infidelity&g_medium=search&g_campaign=tiles) that at half or more of all married men have had an affair.
1.6.4.4.1. Con: Believing something to be common does not mean that you view that thing as minor or insignificant.
1.6.4.4.1.1. Con: But it does normalize the behavior, which in and of itself blunts the normative significance of violating it.
1.6.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: For example, a parent will not regard their teenage child's experimentations with alcohol or sex as either minor or insignificant. But if they take them to be "normal," they will also find them to be less morally problematic.
1.6.4.5. Pro: According to an [American study](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/f45071d/_Lib_Proxy_Url/www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656697921759), about half of all marriages involve cheating at some point.
1.6.4.6. Con: Judging from research, only a minority cheats. According to America's [General Social Survey](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/health/28well.html), about 10% of people in a relationship cheat in any given year. The [lifetime rate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-02/cheating-wives-narrowed-infidelity-gap-over-two-decades) of infidelity is 21% for men and 15% for women.
1.6.4.6.1. Con: According to [some authors](http://ideas.ted.com/10-facts-about-infidelity-helen-fisher/), up to 40% of men and 25% of women cheat during their lifetime while [others](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J398v04n02_02?journalCode=wcrt20) speak of up to 70%.
1.6.5. Con: A one-night stand is as much a reason to confess as a full-blown affair since it still involves sex - which is typically not acceptable in exclusive relationships.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Sex is what makes it "cheating", and not the length or breath of the affair. So, because it happened once does not make it any less important a subject to confess to.
1.6.6. Con: Whether a one-night stand is significant in the context of a relationship should be decided by both partners. Hence, the partner deserves to be informed.
1.6.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.4.
1.6.7. Pro: Sexual infidelity is often found when individuals experience [sexual boredom](http://psp.sagepub.com/content/23/10/1034.short) but are otherwise satisfied with the relationship.
1.6.7.1. Con: This still indicates underpinning issues in the relationship that one's partner deserves to know about and have an opportunity to address.
1.6.7.2. Con: This does not make the breach of trust any less significant.
1.6.8. Con: If a one-night stand is insignificant, there is no reason to hide it.
1.6.8.1. Pro: A [study](http://www.marquette.edu/psyc/documents/GundersonFerrari2008ForgivenessofSexualCheating.pdf) found that people are more likely to forgive and less likely to worry about their partner's future behaviour when they have been cheated on only once, compared to frequently. This could indicate that an insignificant one-night stand would likely be forgiven by the partner, therefore it is not needed to hide it.
1.7. Con: By revealing it you open up the possibility of being blackmailed by your significant other or by the one-night stand partner.
1.7.1. Pro: The other party to the one-night stand may harass you or your partner and cause problems, for example, by continuously sending flowers to your home. If the cheated-upon partner already knows about the one-night stand, any harassment will not be a surprise.
1.7.1.1. Con: If you make clear from the beginning that you are in a relationship and that is just a one-night stand, it is less likely that the person might want to cause you problems.
1.7.2. Pro: The presence of a demand for exclusivity and the perceived threat of blackmail are strong indicators of an unhealthy relationship and/or risk taking behavior which warrants a period of abstinence and self reflection.
1.7.3. Pro: By confessing to your partner, they will hold a “trump card” against you. They will able to end every future argument by reminding you that you cheated.
1.7.3.1. Con: In a functioning relationship, once issues are resolved they don't come up in arguments.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: If partners can gain benefits by using the trump card most will do it because humans are egoistic.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: In healthy relationships, parties to the relationship try to set aside self-interest, and act in the interest of the relationship as a whole.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: Ideally, partners don't collect "trump cards" for emotional blackmail.
1.7.3.1.2.1. Con: Infidelity is such an emotional issue that it is difficult to stick to ideal behavioural norms.
1.7.4. Con: The potential for blackmail by the one-night stand partner is much larger when the cheating partner did not confess but tries to hide the misstep by all means.
1.7.4.1. Con: Taking the risk and not confessing until blackmail attempts are made is a cost free strategy.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: An early reveal reduces the damage compared to the case of the one-night stand coming to light at a later stage.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: Of course if it was done in the past then it shouldn't matter. Your partner would understand that what was done in the past can't be undone and its best to move on from the situation and look to the future.
1.7.4.1.1.2. Pro: Even if you don't expect that the affair will be revealed, you can't discount the chance you will end up confessing later.
1.7.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Not revealing the affair is something that will get worse over time, and while revealing it early could end the relationship, it could also be salvageable. The longer you sit on it, the more likely it is you're going to lose your partner, or entire social circles.
1.7.4.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Generally, the longer a lie is concealed the more offended we are when it comes to light. Some small delaying is reasonable on the grounds of timing or uncertainty, but as time passes those excuses evaporate.
1.7.4.1.1.3. Pro: Finding out about a betrayal from someone else is more damaging to a relationship than being directly enlightened by the partner, because it conveys a stronger sense that one has been deceived.
1.7.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Many people will not believe third parties who report infidelity.
1.7.4.1.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.7.3.1.1.
1.7.4.1.1.3.3. Pro: A [study](http://www.marquette.edu/psyc/documents/GundersonFerrari2008ForgivenessofSexualCheating.pdf) found that finding out from a third party is the discovery method that is the least likely to be forgiven.
1.7.4.1.1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.3.1.1.1.
1.7.4.1.1.3.5. Pro: Finding out about the infidelity from another person is more likely to foster vengeful thoughts than a confession. [\(Gunderson, Ferrari, p. 4\)](http://www.marquette.edu/psyc/documents/GundersonFerrari2008ForgivenessofSexualCheating.pdf)
1.7.4.1.1.4. Pro: Choosing to do this gives you control over the future, and how the confession happens. You don't have to confess immediately, and you can introspect until you know what you need to say.
1.7.4.1.1.5. Pro: A confession is a way of taking responsibility for one's actions. By making this choice, a cheater looks sincere and willing to face the inevitable problems a relationship can have as a result of infidelity.
1.7.4.1.1.5.1. Pro: This shows commitment to healing the relationship from this damage.
1.7.4.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.3.1.
1.7.4.1.1.7. Con: Even if the cheating is later discovered, if you haven't told and haven't kept in touch with the person, this will show to your partner that you had no interest in anything more than a one night stand.
1.7.4.1.1.7.1. Con: This is only one way your partner might interpret your actions, and not the most likely one at that.
1.7.4.1.1.7.1.1. Pro: They may interpret your actions as demonstrating that you view your commitment to them as something to be casually broken, even for minimal benefit.
1.7.4.1.1.7.1.2. Pro: They may interpret your actions as showing determination to avoid suspicion and make it easier to commit other acts of infidelity.
1.7.4.1.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.
1.7.4.1.1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.10.2.
1.7.4.1.1.10. Con: -> See 1.5.5.3.2.1.3.
1.7.4.2. Pro: The direct costs to a blackmailer of actually carrying out his or her threat are marginal. This invites the one-night stand partner to make demands.
1.7.4.2.1. Pro: Not even the name is necessary as even an anonymous letter is likely to arouse suspicion with the partner.
1.7.4.2.2. Con: It still costs time and energy. Most people are unlikely to go out of their way to blackmail someone after a one-night stand.
1.7.4.2.3. Con: Most people would be very embarrassed by being exposed in their social circle as a blackmailer, which would likely happen if they actually went ahead and revealed the one-night stand.
1.7.4.3. Pro: The threat of blackmail can be repeated, which invites the one-night stand partner to attempt it quickly and with increasing demands.
1.7.4.3.1. Pro: Demands increase because the blackmailee experiences a [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy) that makes them accept higher demands.
1.7.4.3.2. Pro: The consequences of refusing the demands of the blackmailing one-night stand partner increase with every demand accepted, as the relationship partner will feel even more betrayed.
1.7.4.4. Con: As blackmailing is generally considered immoral it is an unlikely threat to be put forward.
1.7.4.5. Con: This assumes that the partner in the one-night stand is interested in such behaviour, or has the information necessary to commit blackmail. This is unlikely.
1.7.4.5.1. Pro: Blackmail is illegal, and people will fear legal consequences.
1.7.4.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.4.
1.7.4.6. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.7.4.4.
1.7.6. Con: -> See 1.7.4.5.1.
1.8. Pro: It is disrespectful to your partner to conceal that you broke your commitment to exclusivity.
1.8.1. Pro: If you respect your partner, then you respect their right to know who they are in a relationship with. Concealing behaviour that reveals your attitude and actions towards fidelity takes away your partner's right to choose the kind of relationship they want to be in.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Your partner has the right to know how committed you are to the relationship.
1.8.2. Pro: You shouldn't be in a relationship in the first place if you are even contemplating, let alone partaking in a one-night stand. Given that revealing the infidelity is likely to end the relationship, it is clearly the morally right thing to do and in everyone's best interests.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Dishonesty is worse than the actual affair. The relationship might end, but maybe that is what needs to happen and is actually a good thing.
1.8.3. Pro: Risking being honest and then really listening to your partner's response is the ideal response. That maintains the trust which is a cornerstone of any good relationship. If you can't do it, the relationship hasn't reached that level yet.
1.8.4. Pro: Concealing such an action is an ongoing deceit that will persist throughout the entire length of your relationship.
1.8.5. Pro: [Some](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201208/in-relationships-respect-may-be-even-more-crucial-love) suggest that respect is even more crucial than love for a successful relationship.
1.8.6. Con: Infidelity is not necessarily the result of disrespect for the partner but statistically also a function of whether one lives in a city and whether the partners have separate social networks \([Treas and Giesen, p. 55](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00048.x/full)\).
1.8.6.1. Con: These are factors that may increase the ease with which someone might act on the urge to have an affair, but do not say anything as regards the disrespect it demonstrates to act on that urge, and to conceal that breach of commitment.
1.8.7. Pro: The premise of a committed relationship is the interweaving of two people's lives. Thus, there is an obligation to inform the other person of a break in that bond.
1.8.7.1. Pro: The social norms against infidelity are nearly universal. [Majorities](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/14/french-more-accepting-of-infidelity-than-people-in-other-countries/) in most countries regard an affair as something negative.
1.8.7.1.1. Con: Less than half of all [French](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/16/infidelity-study_n_4611674.html) people consider an affair to be morally wrong.
1.8.7.2. Con: Some types of infidelity are more [acceptable](http://libproxy.snu.ac.kr/ceb77fd/_Lib_Proxy_Url/www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00926239508404399?src=recsys) to people than others, e.g. affairs while dating are seen as more acceptable than during marriage.
1.8.7.3. Con: Given how often committed partnerships end, the interweaving of two people's lives is often not deep enough to form an obligation.
1.8.7.3.1. Con: Just because a commitment might be short term does not mean the commitment does not exist.
1.8.7.3.2. Con: People do not usually enter committed relationships under the expectation that the relationship will end, or the commitment will be broken.
1.8.7.3.2.1. Con: A lot of people enter into relationships being aware that they will experience significant difficulties in the future and that the relationship might end.
1.8.7.3.2.1.1. Con: Being aware that something might happen and expecting it to happen to you are very different things.
1.8.7.3.2.2. Con: Many soon to be married couples sign marriage contracts to mitigate the risks that the relationship will end. This, at least, show that they expect a certain likelihood of an end.
1.8.7.4. Con: An interwoven relationship creates no obligation to be honest.
1.8.7.4.1. Con: Romantic relationships usually come with the implicit agreement to honestly share information that is relevant to this relationship with one another.
1.8.7.4.2. Pro: Being honest makes oneself more vulnerable and as there is no guarantee that the partner will not exploit this there is an obligation to protect oneself that outweighs the obligation to be honest.
1.8.7.4.2.1. Con: It's better to admit to making a mistake and thus prevent a relationship from failing. Honesty can be an asset.
1.8.7.4.2.2. Con: There is no self-protection gained by being dishonest about a one-night stand.
1.8.7.5. Pro: Creating a norm of honesty in your relationship is good for you, as it makes it less likely that your partner cheats on you, or betrays you in some other way.
1.8.7.5.1. Con: The partner can always be dishonest without the other partner knowing to further her/his personal benefit.
1.8.8. Con: Revealing it will cause unnecessary harm to your partner.
1.8.8.1. Con: The harm is only unnecessary if the relationship continues. In the vast majority of cases it should not, as the idea of cheating assumes there is an understanding between those involved that it is exclusive.
1.8.8.1.1. Con: This understanding makes cheating wrong, it doesn't necessarily make it a deal-breaker. Mistakes can be made.
1.8.8.2. Con: The harm was done before.
1.8.8.2.1. Pro: It's not the revelation the one that causes unwanted despair. Is the act of "cheating". Should a person would want to avoid such despair to its significant other, why do it in the first place?
1.8.8.2.2. Con: The point is not to decide whether is right or wrong to cheat. The harm made by cheating is another subject. We're discussing the harm caused by revealing it — this harm is of a different kind.
1.8.8.3. Pro: The betrayed partner will feel partly responsible for the affair and thus question themselves.
1.8.8.3.1. Pro: Betrayed partners feel anger with themselves for missing out the signs or not being supportive enough for the partner \([Hertlein et al., p. 7](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J398v04n02_02?journalCode=wcrt20)\).
1.8.8.3.2. Pro: According to [one study](http://snu-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?frbrVersion=5&tabs=viewOnlineTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=TN_tayfranc10.1080%2f00926239508404389&indx=1&recIds=TN_tayfranc10.1080%2f00926239508404389&recIdxs=0&elementId=0&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&frbrVersion=5&frbg=&dscnt=1&scp.scps=scope%3A%2882SNU_SSPACE%29%2Cscope%3A%2882SNU_INST%29%2Cscope%3A%2882SNU_COURSE%29%2Cscope%3A%2882SNU_ROSETTA%29%2Cprimo_central_multiple_fe&tb=t&vid=82SNU&mode=Basic&tab=all&srt=rank&prefLang=en_US&dum=true&vl\(freeText0\)=The%20impact%20of%20extramarital%20relationships%20on%20the%20continuation%20of%20marriages&fromLogin=true&dstmp=1474421848629) \(p. 107\), more than two thirds of cheated-upon men and more than half of cheated-upon women suffer "significant damage to their self-image, personal confidence, or sexual confidence".
1.8.8.3.2.1. Con: The cited study does not only cover one-night stands, it also covers longer affairs. It is reasonable to assume that the damage is more severe in such cases; thus, this study is less helpful in specifying the harm caused by one-night stands.
1.8.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.
1.8.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.3.2.
1.8.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.3.2.
1.8.8.7. Pro: With a confession you knowingly harm your partner. You should consider the feelings of your partner when you make the decision about confessing or not.
1.8.8.7.1. Con: You should have considered this before you broke the mutual agreement. Afterwards it's a weak excuse. Another lie just adds to the harm you eventually will have done to your partner.
1.8.8.7.2. Pro: Well-known relationship expert and psychotherapist [Esther Perel](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/03/esther_perel_on_affairs_spouses_in_happy_marriages_cheat_and_americans_don.html) argues that confessing sometimes is an act of "aggression" toward the partner who was cheated on, and that not telling can be "protective" and "an act of respect."
1.8.8.7.2.1. Con: Perel is best known for a series of books condemning American attitudes towards monogamous marriage and affairs and '[priggish and provincial](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/03/esther_perel_on_affairs_spouses_in_happy_marriages_cheat_and_americans_don.html)'. She can hardly be considered a neutral commentator on this issue.
1.8.8.7.2.1.1. Con: American attitudes towards extramarital affairs trend in a conservative direction. Perel's observation echos this.
1.8.8.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: A study comparing attitudes toward nonmarital sex in 24 countries found that on every scale Americans condemn sex before marriage, sex under the age of 16, extramarital sex and homosexual sex more than the average \([Widmer et al., p. 351](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3813111)\).
1.8.8.7.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: This means less STD's and fewer opportunities to have an intellectual or emotional bond overriden by an impulsive physical one.
1.8.8.7.2.1.1.2. Pro: Anglo-Saxon countries in general do trend towards conservative views on extramarital affairs with the US leading them with disapproval rates of over [80%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/14/french-more-accepting-of-infidelity-than-people-in-other-countries/).
1.8.8.7.2.1.1.3. Pro: Between 1972 and 2012 extramarital sex became less acceptable, while the acceptability of other sexual activities, e.g. same-sex, premarital or teen sexual activities increased \([Twenge et al., p. 2278](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25940736)\).
1.8.8.7.2.1.1.4. Con: Even if Americans are unusually prudish, Perel's brand is built on being particularly transgressively in favour of non-monogamous approaches to relationships. Her comments are indicative of this, and demonstrate her lack of independence as a commentator on the effects of infidelity.
1.8.8.7.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: Perel sells books on this topic and therefore has an interest to be perceived as advocate of non-monogamous relationships.
1.8.8.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.3.
1.8.8.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.3.2.
1.8.8.7.5. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.1.
1.8.8.7.6. Pro: Knowledge of having been cheated on [has been linked to](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11068963) the occurrence of depressive episodes for women.
1.8.8.7.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.1.
1.8.8.7.7. Con: The act that actually harmed your partner was the cheating, not the telling them about the cheating.
1.8.8.7.7.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.3.2.1.
1.8.8.8. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.8.8.9. Pro: "Ignorance is bliss": it is more comfortable not to know certain things.
1.8.8.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.7.6.
1.8.8.9.2. Con: It may be more comfortable in the immediate sense, but that does not mean it is better to be deceived about the commitment of one's partner in the longer term.
1.8.8.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.4.1.
1.8.8.11. Pro: Honesty is not always the best policy when handling personal relationships, as the truth can hurt people deeply. A lie or not telling is often more considerate.
1.8.8.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.9.
1.8.8.11.2. Con: While being dishonest may sometimes be considerate, it always violates other norms such as treating others with respect.
1.8.8.11.2.1. Pro: There are instances when the norms of considerateness, which focuses on avoiding causing harm, and respect, which focuses on treatment as an equal, come into conflict with one another.
1.8.8.11.2.1.1. Pro: This is often the case in relationships characterized by [paternalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paternalism/#HardVsSoftPate), such as parent-child relationships as well as some doctor-patient relationships.
1.8.8.11.2.2. Con: Violating norms is acceptable if it brings benefits.
1.8.8.11.3. Con: While this might be true for minor lies and obfuscations, it is certainly not considerate in the context of relationships, and thus in a context that determines the course of whole lives.
1.8.8.11.3.1. Pro: Telling your child their beloved pet has gone to a farm - rather than died - protects them from distress without them being likely to make major decisions on the basis of your lie. Your partner, believing in your commitment, may well change the course of his/her life depending on this lie.
1.8.8.11.3.2. Con: A lot of parents do not opt for telling their children when they are adopted. This surely is a significant lie that has the potential to determine the course of whole lives.
1.8.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.9. Pro: You would expect the same from your partner if they had a one-night stand.
1.9.1. Pro: The definition of an exclusive relationship is that your romantic and sexual experiences are tied to those of your partner as things you will always pursue together. If you cheat you are breaking this bond, as adding a new partner redefines the nature of your current relationship by breaking that shared experience.
1.9.2. Pro: There is no relationship when one partner attempts to copy with cheating by themselves. If someone cheats, that behavior has already been justified in their own mind; but the other partner is not involved in the secret. Better that they  know the truth, because it's better to be alone than in bad company.
1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.8.8.9.
1.9.4. Pro: Knowing about one's partner cheating on you would help you to identify and work on the problems in the relationship.
1.9.5. Pro: Hiding things from one's partner corresponds with hiding parts of us \(i.e., wishes, instincts, values, etc.\). Honesty in a relationship will reveal your partner's character and helps you to decide how to deal with the situation.
1.9.5.1. Con: It is fairly impossible to be accurate about the preferences and ideals of your partner.
1.9.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.2.1.
1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.3.
1.9.7. Con: Your values are not necessarily shared with your partner, the way you want to be treated will not be the way the partner wants to be treated.
1.9.7.1. Con: It is reasonable to expect that couples do share general expectations about their behavior regardless of any difference in values.
1.9.7.1.1. Pro: Because sharing values is a pillar of an exclusive relationship, one knows one's partner sufficiently well and there is a shared interest in not harming each other.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.6.1.
1.11. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.1.
1.12. Pro: One [study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10720169808400162) found that most people regard revealing it as the right thing to do.
1.12.1. Con: This research was conducted with a sample of people deﬁned as ‘sex addicts’ and thus may not have yielded generalizable results.
1.12.2. Pro: Most people [predict](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J056v08n03_02) that they would tell their spouse if they ever engaged in sex outside the relationship. This indicates that they regard a confession as the right thing to do.
1.12.3. Con: The majority opinion is not a good guide for an individual's decision.
1.12.3.1. Pro: Argumentum ad populum is a logical fallacy that cannot be used to prove a point. Just because the masses agree does not mean it's correct.
1.13. Con: Revealing it can cause problems that go far beyond the feelings of those involved in the relationship.
1.13.1. Con: If you decide to do something like this, you can also decide to do it in such a way that minimises its harm. Predicting quantities of harm, or the future, is difficult, if not impossible, but that is not a reason not to try something.
1.13.2. Con: Your problems, and your partner's problems, ought to be important than other people's problems. If your relationship is not your priority, you do not want the relationship.
1.13.3. Pro: A confession can put the one-night stand partner at risk.
1.13.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.4.1.1.
1.13.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.4.1.2.1.
1.13.3.3. Con: The person in question can be kept a secret, both to protect him/her and to not give one's significant other the material for unpleasant mental images.
1.13.3.3.1. Con: It is unrealistic that a confession would not reveal the name of the cheating partner as openness is part of complete reconciliation.
1.13.3.3.1.1. Con: A confession can be balanced with protecting the one-night stand where necessary. Either way, it does not eliminate your ability to be honest with your partner while minimising the risk of violence towards the other party to the infidelity.
1.13.3.3.2. Con: The cheated-upon partner may be upset by not knowing.
1.13.3.3.2.1. Pro: Asking for more details about the affair is a strategy to cope with anger and shock \([Brown, p. 26](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=de&lr=&id=PD6LIuaXcJsC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Patterns+of+infidelity+and+their+treatment&ots=eurjLCs2sQ&sig=RNfIH0H8wHtkIFPDlU_umMe1ru4&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=guilt&f=false)\).
1.13.3.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.13.3.3.1.1.
1.13.3.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.3.3.1.1.
1.13.4. Pro: A confession can make children suffer for the behavior of one of their parents, and especially so if the confession leads to a breakup.
1.13.4.1. Pro: A reveal could break up a family. True remorse should result in a reinvestment in strengthening the relationship and your commitment to it.
1.13.4.2. Pro: According to a [summary of research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10591-015-9364-4) on the topic, parental infidelity can cause "feelings of guilt, anxiety, fear, worry, depression, shock, and aggression" in children.
1.13.4.2.1. Con: None of the cited articles in the review article does deal with children suffering as a result of divorce and are highly specific \([Ablow et al. 2009](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/fam/23/4/485/); [Blodgett Salafia et al. 2013](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10826-013-9771-9); [Dean 2011](http://tfj.sagepub.com/content/19/1/15.short); [Lusterman 2005](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.20193/abstract)\). This weakens the general applicability substantially.
1.13.4.3. Pro: In the United States, according to the [national census](https://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-13.pdf), 28% of the children of divorced parents live in poverty compared to only 19% of other children.
1.13.4.3.1. Con: It is not clear whether this is linked to the effects of divorce, or the economic status of couples more likely to divorce.
1.13.4.4. Con: For children, a separation of the parents can be better than the continuation of a relationship that results in bad parenting.
1.13.4.4.1. Pro: There is widespread and long-standing evidence for marital conflict causing various development problems in children, such as aggression and bad conduct, anxiety, depression and withdrawal, low academic achievements and low social competence \([Cumings at al, p. 120](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=de&lr=&id=rqFYCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=marital+conflict+children&ots=TPz_O3OBpR&sig=dZwR9dN3hyfWDb8v1s1e6U9rBD0#v=onepage&q=children&f=false)\).
1.13.4.4.2. Con: A one-night stand does not indicate a significantly more troubled relationship than the mean given how many people cheat.
1.13.4.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.6.1.
1.13.4.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.6.4.6.
1.13.4.5. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.3.1.
1.13.4.6. Pro: Children will feel that they are missing out on something, when comparing their family to families where parents are not divorced.
1.13.4.6.1. Pro: Only 9% of co-parenting families are harmonious \([Adamsons and Parsley, p. 250](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=de&lr=&id=wGZlAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA241&ots=O50Pkor1pF&sig=Lm6KjPyaIpmXZn3LpspgGWt6qH4&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)\). Other children will experience a lack of peaceful family dinners or cordial family holidays.
1.13.4.6.1.1. Con: Not all of this lack of harmony will arise after the divorce or separation. In many cases, these families will not have been harmonious to begin with, and so the separation may simply reduce the child's exposure to that conflict.
1.13.4.7. Con: Many children and families resume normal functioning following the initial crisis period after divorce \([Barber et al., p.108](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1539085)\).
1.13.4.8. Pro: Children will face stereotypes, such as the assumed inability to do well in peer relationships \([Arendell, p. 100](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=de&lr=&id=Y9KyTMamKL0C&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=Mothers+and+divorce:+Legal,+economic,+and+social+dilemmas&ots=7JZQlK3WPy&sig=ym8nlfFnlqh3YaABnjjzc04cbNw#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.13.4.8.1. Con: Given that divorce is relatively common, such stigmas and assumptions are being constantly undermined as people meet more and more happy and well-adjusted children of divorced parents. It is worth noting that the book cited here is from 1986 - it is possible, indeed, likely, that such stigmas have substantially reduced since then.
1.13.4.9. Con: Growing up in a single parent household presents children and adolescents with a unique set of challenges, thus allowing for the development of new skills and coping strategies.
1.13.4.9.1. Pro: Children in single-parent homes have more [household responsibility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3390248/), demonstrated by the time spent on doing chores.
1.13.4.9.2. Pro: Children gain more independence in single parent households.
1.13.4.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.9.1.
1.13.4.9.2.2. Pro: Single-parent families have different authority structures, as there are not two partners that collaborate on and reinforce each others' decisions about rules and discipline. This allows the child more room for decision-making.
1.13.4.9.2.2.1. Con: Conversely, the lack of a collaborative partner may simply result in decisions made by the single parent being treated as unquestionable.
1.13.4.9.2.3. Pro: Single parents try to teach more on financial independence because of their personal experience and a more difficult [financial situation](http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/articles/quality-of-life/poverty-social-exclusion-and-single-parent-families).
1.13.4.9.2.3.1. Con: Non-single parents in a more precarious financial situation are more likely to teach their children financial independence as well.
1.13.4.9.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.13.4.3.
1.13.4.9.2.4. Con: This is not necessarily a good thing. Young children need structure and order in their lives to instill healthy behaviour patterns.
1.13.4.9.2.5. Con: This is not always the case. Single parents can become overprotective in an effort to gain more control over their child and reduce the risk of losing him/her as well.
1.13.4.9.2.5.1. Pro: Raising their children successfully tends to become the most important goal for single parents. Sometimes, this focus is expressed through overprotectiveness [\(Handel, p.610\)](https://books.google.at/books?id=SpdLuO8_rQ4C&pg=PA610&lpg=PA610&dq=single+parent+likelihood+of+becoming+overprotective&source=bl&ots=mbLQ-QoW1r&sig=IAufBXv3trSfFugYXqZbYXMUvzA&hl=ro&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD0fv-prPQAhWKOSwKHZ89Bac4ChDoAQhjMAk#v=onepage&q=single%20parent%20likelihood%20of%20becoming%20overprotective&f=false).
1.13.4.9.3. Con: Divorce does not necessarily lead to single-parent families. The parent with primary custody may remarry, or the separated couple may co-parent.
1.13.4.9.3.1. Pro: Co-parenting appears relatively frequent with 80% of divorced reporting moderate or high interaction that remains high in the long term \([Adamsons and Parsley, p. 250](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=de&lr=&id=wGZlAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA241&ots=O50Pkor1pF&sig=Lm6KjPyaIpmXZn3LpspgGWt6qH4&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)\).
1.13.4.9.3.2. Con: Around 30% of co-parenting families are antagonistic \([Adamsons and Parsley, p. 250](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=de&lr=&id=wGZlAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA241&ots=O50Pkor1pF&sig=Lm6KjPyaIpmXZn3LpspgGWt6qH4&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)\). This continues the stress and discomfort a child has to endure during divorce.
1.13.4.9.3.3. Con: After a breakup, some [15-20%](http://www.census.gov/prod/2011pubs/p60-240.pdf) \(p. 10\) of American parents who separate from their partner lose child custody and are not part of a joint custodial arrangement. They effectively loose guaranteed access to their children.
1.13.4.9.4. Con: Children in married families display [greater](http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/2010/05/risk-and-resilience-in-children-coping-with-parental-divorce/) resilience than those in divorced families.
1.13.4.10. Con: Growing up in a single-mother-headed household will influence values for work and family in a positive way \([Barber, p. 115](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1539085)\).
1.13.4.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.9.2.2.
1.13.4.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.9.1.
1.13.4.10.3. Pro: Children of single mothers may develop occupational aspirations and family values that are less shaped by gender-specific stereotypes than would otherwise be the case, e.g. for maternal employment \([Barber, p. 115](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1539085)\).
1.13.4.11. Pro: When infidelity is the reason for divorce, the negative effects of divorce on children's psychology are [exacerbated](http://jar.sagepub.com/content/13/3/320).
1.13.4.12. Pro: If a confession leads to a breakup or divorce, and that leads to a child growing up with only one parent, this will likely affect their educational achievement in a negative way, as studies from [Sweden](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0031383910340101), [Korea](http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol18/13/) and the [United States](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2839245/) suggest.
1.13.4.12.1. Con: Some studies have found a positive advantage for children in father-absent homes on verbal skills \([Barber, p. 114](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1539085)\).
1.13.4.12.2. Con: -> See 1.13.4.9.3.
1.13.4.13. Pro: If a confession leads to a breakup or divorce, and that leads to a child growing up with only one parent, this will increase the chances of the child [developing substance abuse issues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16393197) and/or [committing crimes](http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2012/12/the-real-complex-connection-between-single-parent-families-and-crime/265860/), as studies show.
1.13.4.13.1. Pro: Another study has indicated that children from single-parent families are more [prone](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=167327) than children from two-parent families to use drugs, be gang members, be expelled from school, be committed to reform institutions, and become juvenile murderers.
1.13.4.13.1.1. Con: -> See 1.13.4.9.3.
1.13.4.13.1.2. Pro: Risk of drug use in single-parent families arises partly because of a lower capacity to control their children.
1.13.4.13.1.3. Pro: Alcohol consumption is positively [linked](https://www.addiction.com/3003/will-alcohol-abuse-lead-divorce/) to divorce rates. Children in divorced families will therefore be more exposed to alcohol consumption they will imitate.
1.13.4.13.2. Con: -> See 1.13.4.9.3.
1.13.4.14. Con: The child does not have to compete for bonding time with a second parent.
1.13.4.14.1. Con: If the child would have to compete for bonding time with a second parent, that would probably be a result of bad parenting, which would be unlikely to change because of the break-up.
1.13.4.14.2. Con: The child would probably have more bonding time with the other parent if they still lived together, which could compensate for the time the parents spend bonding without their child.
1.13.5. Pro: A confession can lead to extensive divorce litigation, financial problems, and loss of child custody.
1.13.5.1. Pro: Research [indicates](http://www.divorce.usu.edu/files/uploads/Lesson7.pdf) that divorcées usually would need a 30% increase in income to preserve the living standard they had prior to the divorce.
1.13.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.3.
1.13.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.9.3.3.
1.13.6. Pro: A break-up can put mutual friends in the awkward position of choosing sides.
1.14. Con: -> See 1.8.8.
1.15. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.
1.16. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.3.2.1.2.4.
