Discussion Title: Should Culturally or Historically Significant Artwork Be Property of the State?

1. Culturally or historically significant artwork should become the property of the state
1.1. Con: It is unfair to private owners and collectors for their property to be forcibly bought from them.
1.1.1. Con: To many owners, this artwork would have more than just monetary value. For example, artwork pertaining to their own culture could have cultural, historical and sentimental value. As such, money cannot adequately compensate for this.
1.1.2. Con: To many cultures, certain artworks are seen as priceless and as such no amount of money can compensate for their loss.
1.1.3. Pro: This can be negated by having a fair and reasonable process in which the government purchases the artwork for a fair price
1.1.4. Con: It is impossible to place a value on artwork because it has cultural and personal value too. As such, it is impossible to negotiate a fair price without the risk of placing either no value on cultural significance, in which the original owners are not adequately compensated, or far too much value on cultural significance, in which case private owners could negotiate for  massive and unfair prices.
1.2. Con: This removes the cultural value of artworks by putting a price on them.
1.2.1. Con: Priceless artworks will be sold for money, from members of the creating culture to the government, which devalues the artworks because they lose some of their historical context, as they are no longer owned by their rightful owners.
1.2.2. Con: Many will rightfully perceive certain artworks to be priceless, which is trivialized if the artworks are bought and sold.
1.2.3. Con: Culturally significant artworks will now have a value, which will be used to compare different artworks and cultures. This trivializes artwork because people will focus on its monetary as opposed to cultural value.
1.3. Con: It would cost a lot of money for the State to buy this art off private owners and collectors
1.3.1. Con: Some artworks are, to the people who value them most, priceless, and as such no monetary value can accurately compensate for how significant and special they are.
1.3.2. Pro: As it is only the most significant artworks in question, this is a limited cost
1.3.3. Pro: Any cost is worth it to achieve the benefits of having the State own this artwork and making it more accessible to the general public
1.3.4. Con: This puts a price on the cultural and historical artwork and so, by extension, put a price or a value on the culture and aspect of history in question
1.3.5. Pro: By selling significant artwork to the State, indigenous groups are able to use that money to promote their culture e.g. introduce programmes that teach traditional cultural art methods
1.4. Pro: Defining what is culturally or historically significant allows a government to present a particular historical narrative that works in their favour
1.4.1. Pro: This can be used as a source of political legitimacy as it presents the rule of the government in question as the outcome of history
1.4.1.1. Pro: This helps stabilise the government and allow them to get on with policy making and bettering the country
1.4.1.2. Con: Opponents to the government are seen as on the wrong side of history
1.4.1.2.1. Con: This may make it harder for opponents to be seen favourably, even if they have good intentions
1.4.1.3. Con: Governments whose ligitimacy is being questioned would do better to spend resources on more pressing tasks as opposed to claiming artworks.
1.4.1.4. Con: Govenments can cherry pick artworks, and present them out of context to create a false or biased history, whilst remaining legitimate.
1.4.2. Con: This makes it difficult for citizens to develop an uninfluenced or unbiased perception of their history
1.5. Pro: This is an opportunity to repatriate artwork to the country where it came from
1.5.1. Pro: This would be a source of national pride for the country as they are getting back what may have been previously stolen or looted from them
1.5.1.1. Pro: As much art was taken in the context of imperialism, colonialism, and war, this is a good opportunity to right old wrongs and finally start to settle old grievances
1.5.1.2. Pro: For culturally significant indigenous artwork that was taken offshore, by buying it back, the State is showing that they respect these indigenous groups
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: As many indigenous groups may not have the funds to repatriate this artwork by themselves, having the State buy it back enables the artwork to return home
1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: This could reinforce to the indigenous group the perception that they are wholly dependent on the State
1.5.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This could have a demoralising effect for members of the indigenous group
1.5.1.2.1.1.2. Con: This could discourage the indigenous group from feeling they are able to speak up against the State
1.5.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: This could help break down divisions between groups as they can all understand that while they may have differences, they are all a part of the same State
1.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: This means that members of the indigenous group have better access to the artwork that is most significant to them
1.5.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Having access to this artwork can be a way to promote the culture to younger generations of the indigenous group that may have become distanced from their culture
1.5.1.2.1.2.2. Con: Majority groups could perceive this as a waste of State money for what only benefits a few
1.5.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: This could worsen relations between majority, minority, and indigenous groups
1.5.1.2.1.3. Pro: This art can also now be accessed by the general public
1.5.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.1.2.2.
1.5.2. Con: Once repatriated, it may be harder for people from all around the world to have access to the art
1.5.2.1. Con: The rest of the world may have less opportunity to learn about the significant culture and history of the artwork's country of origin
1.5.3. Pro: When owned by the State, the art can be put in museums and galleries and can be accessed by the public
1.5.3.1. Pro: The public are enriched culturally when they have access to this Art
1.5.3.1.1. Con: It is not necessary for the State to own the artwork for this cultural enrichment to occur e.g. the public could just look at photos of the work online or prints of it
1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Looking at the work in person makes it tangibly there and it is also better to view all the minute details that are lost when it is put online or in print version
1.5.3.1.2. Con: This only aids the public who live nearby the galleries and museums where the artwork is displayed
1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: This doesn't help members of the public who live rurally or those who are unable to travel to the main centres to view this artwork
1.5.3.1.2.2. Pro: As most people live in the cities and the main centres, this enables the largest amount of people possible to have access to the artwork
1.5.3.1.2.3. Pro: Most national galleries and museums are free of charge or by donation only, so they are highly accessible to the public
1.5.3.2. Pro: This gives the general public a sense of ownership over the artwork
1.5.3.2.1. Con: In the context of culturally significant art, that is significant to indigenous groups, this can be seen as the majority group appropriating the culture of the minority group
1.5.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.1.2.2.1.
1.5.3.2.1.2. Pro: This could help the culture to survive, albeit with less integrity and less authenticity
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: In the context of culturally significant art, this can inspire members of majority cultural groups to connect more and develop greater understandings of minority cultural groups
1.5.3.2.2.1. Pro: This can allow them to become an effective ally to minority groups and support them against any injustices that may have been done towards them
1.5.3.2.2.2. Pro: The majority groups need to have a greater understanding of minority indigenous cultures as many aspects of these cultures, such as language and traditional practices, are dying out and will only survive if taken up by the majority group
1.5.3.2.2.3. Con: This can be seen as very patronising and members of the minority cultural groups may get offended
1.5.3.2.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.1.2.2.1.
1.5.3.3. Con: For cultural art that was designed to be seen at a local cultural place e.g. marae, the character of the art may be affected by the sterile location to which it is being relocated
1.5.3.4. Pro: Art is better able to be looked after in a museum or gallery where there are curators and experts at hand to preserve it
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: This means that the art will be able to be preserved and accessible for future generation
1.5.3.4.2. Con: In the context of cultural art taken from indigenous groups, this undermines their ability to preserve their art
1.5.3.4.2.1. Con: This could be seen as disrespectful to that indigenous group
1.5.3.4.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.2.2.3.
1.5.3.5. Con: To be presented in these galleries or museums, the art will have to be relocated from where it was originally, and so those who previously had access to it would have less ease of access to the art
1.5.3.5.1. Con: The indigenous group may lose access to it
1.5.3.5.1.1. Con: Younger generations of the indigenous group may be further detached from their culture as they don't have easy access to significant links to their cultural heritage
1.5.3.5.1.1.1. Con: Being distanced from one's culture and not knowing one's roots can have devastating social problems and is perceived to be linked with higher crime rates, lower education rates etc.
1.5.3.5.1.1.1.1. Con: This can lead to negative perceptions of people in these groups and poorer racial relations
1.5.3.5.2. Pro: The majority of the population would have better access to it
1.5.4. Con: The act of repatriation can cause old grievances to resurface and remind both countries that the art was stolen or taken in the first place
1.5.4.1. Con: This can cause old grudges between States to resurface, destabilising the relations between the two
1.5.5. Con: The act of repatriation can cause headline scandals for the country that took the art
1.5.5.1. Con: This can cause the external perceptions of the museums and galleries in this country to deteriorate
1.5.5.2. Con: This implicates museums and galleries with the actions of States
1.5.5.2.1. Con: This disadvantages the global project of working towards “universal” institutions presenting the art and history of the world
1.5.6. Con: The detracts from the diverse and cosmopolitan nature of museums and galleries worldwide [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/29/museums-looting-art-artefacts-world-culture)
1.5.7. Pro: Repatriation fights the illegal trade of stolen art
1.5.7.1. Pro: As rates of repatriation rise, collectors will be forced to be aware of whether they are purchasing legal or illegal artwork as they will not want to purchase artwork that was stolen as it will be requested to be returned to the country of origin and so the collector would lose money on it
1.5.7.2. Pro: There will be increasingly legal transaction of art
1.5.8. Con: Repatriation puts artwork at risk
1.5.8.1. Pro: Works that are repatriated to unstable areas could be damaged by war, terrorism, or even discarded and left uncared for if the nature of local politics changes[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jun/29/museums-looting-art-artefacts-world-culture)
1.5.8.2. Pro: The significant artwork may be damaged while being transported back to its country of origin
1.5.9. Pro: In the future, less artwork looting of newly discovered peoples or cultures will take place because there is a precedent for artwork to be returned to its original location.
1.6. Pro: This allows the government to pay homage to specific cultural groups in its society
1.6.1. Pro: This is empowering for minority cultures as their culture is being showcased, preserved and presented in a positive light
1.6.2. Con: Private owners can potentially have a more power to pay homage as they have a more vested, personal interest in the artworks, and may also be a part of the original culture from where the artwork orginated.
1.6.3. Con: The individual cultural value of the artwork may be diminished as the government owns them all, as opposed to individual owners having rights to them.
1.6.4. Pro: This could encourage artists to produce more artworks.
1.6.5. Pro: This can stabilise relations within the state between majority and minority cultural groups as it emphasizes the importance of groups that may feel underrecognized
1.6.6. Con: This can destabilise relations between minority and majority cultural groups if certain groups' art is not included in being defined as significant
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.
1.8. Con: For culturally significant artwork that was owned by local indigenous groups, it would be perceived that the State is taking their culture away from them
1.8.1. Con: This can further agitate relations, which are often already strained, between the state and minority cultures.
1.8.2. Pro: This perception would be minimised by the fact that proper purchasing procedures would be upheld
1.8.2.1. Con: Many indigenous groups have different understandings of the concept of ownership, and so there understanding of the purchase may differ to that of the State
1.8.3. Pro: When the State owns this artwork, all groups in the country have access to this artwork
1.8.3.1. Pro: This means that more groups can appreciate this artwork, and by extension, this culture
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: This would lead to better cross-cultural relations between majority groups, indigenous groups, and other minority groups
1.8.3.2. Con: Indigenous groups may feel that they have already sacrificed so much, or have had so much already taken from them, for the benefit of the rest of the country
1.8.4. Con: When owned by the State, it could be taken away from where the local indigenous groups were previously showing it
1.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.5.1.
1.8.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.5.2.
1.8.5. Con: This could compound on previous perceptions that the State, as a type of colonial power, is favouring the majority groups over indigenous minority groups
1.8.5.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.1.2.2.1.
