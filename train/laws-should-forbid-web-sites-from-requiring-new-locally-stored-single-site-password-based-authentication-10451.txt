Discussion Title: Laws should forbid web sites from requiring new locally-stored, single-site, password-based authentication.

1. Laws should forbid web sites from requiring new locally-stored, single-site, password-based authentication.
1.1. Con: Allowing governments to mandate the kind of security used for websites constitutes a threat to website security by itself.
1.1.1. Pro: Government may not always have security as its top priority when setting mandatory security policies for companies.
1.1.2. Pro: Government may be slow to adapt laws and regulations in the face of new threats, limiting the ability of companies to respond.
1.2. Pro: Because of the limits of human memory, the more sites use passwords, the less secure they become.
1.2.1. Pro: Many people use [easy-to-remember](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords)passwords or combinations.
1.2.1.1. Pro: This makes most passwords easy to guess for malicious actors or cracking programs.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Password-cracking programs run through large sets of combinations, so length is more important than randomness.
1.2.2. Pro: Over 80% of US-American users use the same password for [multiple sites](https://www.secureauth.com/company/newsroom/secureauth-survey-majority-reuse-passwords).
1.2.3. Con: [Diceware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware) is a method of creating secure passwords that are easy to remember.
1.3. Pro: Having passwords separately stored on a wide range of sites potentially means that an attack on any of these sites can compromise a password.
1.3.1. Con: Passwords are usually stored as hashes, rather than as cleartext lists.
1.3.1.1. Con: Hashing of passwords has not previously prevented them being calculated from data stolen from sites.
1.4. Pro: A culture in which any random site can demand a user create a new account makes it easy for fake sites to demand data that might be useful for later attacks.
1.4.1. Pro: Phishing attacks against businesses have been on the [rise](https://blog.dashlane.com/phishing-statistics/).
1.5. Con: Requiring the use of single sign-on would mean that a hack on the site providing this service would be catastrophic.
1.5.1. Con: Most users already have one or two passwords which would be catastrophic if hacked \(eg, bank and e-mail accounts\), and these sites have corresponding investment in security, the benefits of which could be transferred to other sites.
1.6. Con: More complex security measures will discourage users from engaging with sites in the first place.
1.7. Con: The ability for web sites to distribute data across the world means that no single country could enforce a forbidding law.
1.7.1. Con: We should adopt an international law on digital rights
1.7.1.1. Pro: There exists international solutions to data problems, e.g. [European GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/)
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: International regulation will be the future, since transnational problems cannot be solved with national laws.
1.8. Con: It is impossible to hold web site operators legally responsible for their security because doing so would require them to provide digital forensics evidence against themselves.
1.9. Pro: The lack of legal consequences for sites that are hacked allows for innovative approaches to authentication to be ignored, and discourages investment in developing them.
