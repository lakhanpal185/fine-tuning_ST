Discussion Title: Is SESTA - FOSTA helpful or harmful?

1. SESTA - FOSTA does more harm than good.
1.1. Con: SESTA received [bipartisan support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Enabling_Sex_Traffickers_Act) which explains the fast adaption.
1.1.1. Con: Bipartisan support for a bill does not necessarily indicate that it is a good idea. Historically, abhorrent policies such as the internment of [Japanese-Americans](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/22/politics/bipartisanship-gone-bad/index.html) along with ill-thought out policies, such as the intervention in [Iraq](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/22/politics/bipartisanship-gone-bad/index.html) have received bipartisan support.
1.2. Con: Congress [strongly supported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Enabling_Sex_Traffickers_Act) the bill.
1.2.1. Con: This doesn't mean they had a nuanced or helpful understanding of how the bill would operate.
1.2.2. Con: The legislation was [rushed through](http://techfreedom.org/backpage-shutdown-proves-sesta-rushed-unncessarily/) Congress without the necessary investigation and interrogation of its possible affects. This means that members of Congress may have not had the time to fully understand the effects of the bill and their support may be misplaced.
1.2.3. Con: It is rarely a politically acceptable position to oppose legislation which purports to fight sex-trafficking. It is likely that many legislators supported the legislation without knowing or caring about its [negative effects](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/13/17172762/fosta-sesta-backpage-230-internet-freedom) on the lives of sex workers or on internet freedom.
1.3. Con: Several advocacy groups are [in favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Enabling_Sex_Traffickers_Act) of the bill, one naming it 'groundbreaking'.
1.3.1. Pro: The [New Jersey Coalition Against Human Trafficking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Enabling_Sex_Traffickers_Act#Advocacy_Groups) supports the bill.
1.4. Pro: The bill blatantly targets sex workers.
1.4.1. Pro: Sex workers use the internet to make their jobs safer; SESTA-FOSTA shuts down their avenues for support and safety.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Sex workers used the websites that SESTA-FOSTA has [targeted](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/13/17172762/fosta-sesta-backpage-230-internet-freedom) instead of resorting to using a pimp. Since the passage of SESTA-FOSTA, sex workers [have reported](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjpqvz/fosta-sesta-sex-work-and-trafficking) abusive pimps returning to their lives, along with increased intimidation and abuse.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Sex workers used sites taken down by SESTA-FOSTA as an alternative to soliciting customers on the street, which comes with increased [risks](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1080/0042098042000243110) of violence, harassment from community protesters and threats from police.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: In the weeks following the passage of SESTA-FOSTA, [anecdotal reports](http://titsandsass.com/on-the-death-of-backpage/) from sex workers claim that 13 sex workers have gone missing, and 2 have been confirmed dead. This occurred after these sex workers were denied access to the websites where they had previously sold their services.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Sex workers use the internet to find support networks, as well as to solicit their services. As facilitating [sex work](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/anti-sex-trafficking-advocates-say-new-law-cripples-efforts-to-save-victims-629081/) is poorly defined in the legislation, these services that are essential for the safety of sex worker have also come under threat.
1.4.2. Pro: SESTA - FOSTA undermines certain websites by removing [safe harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor_\(law\)) protections which stop those websites from becoming criminally responsible for criminal material posted on their sites. These same websites are used by [legitimate sex workers](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qvxeyq/trump-signed-fosta-sesta-into-law-sex-work). These workers are hurt when these websites can no longer hurt them.
1.4.3. Con: All sex work is exploitative for the people involved in it. By removing sites which facilitate sex work, fewer people will become involved in sex work and those currently involved may be discouraged.
1.4.4. Pro: The worst excesses of sex trafficking can and are addressed by prosecuting those who are [actively](https://abcnews.go.com/US/emotional-senate-hearing-finds-backpage-complicit-underage-sex/story?id=44762342) complicit in it. Taking down sites used by legitimate sex workers is totally unnecessary.
1.4.5. Pro: Both anti trafficking pro-sex work [survivors](https://medium.com/\@lauralemoon/trafficking-survivors-dont-want-sesta-we-want-to-not-be-dying-in-poverty-35fa80623f00) and [anti-sex-work](http://kval.com/news/local/advocates-for-sex-trafficking-victims-worry-federal-legislation-could-hurt-their-efforts) [oppose](https://survivorsagainstsesta.org/articles/) it.
1.4.5.1. Pro: The bill impacts women's safety by removing their [ability to screen](https://rewire.news/article/2018/04/02/sesta-already-devastating-impacts-sex-workers-just-like-predicted/) potentially harmful customers.
1.5. Pro: The bill is already impacting normal site operations such as [personals](https://www.thedailybeast.com/sex-workers-fear-for-their-future-how-sesta-is-putting-many-prostitutes-in-peril) and personal [Google drive](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kgwnp/porn-on-google-drive-error) accounts.
1.5.1. Con: These are teething troubles, there is no reason to suggest that long-term it won't be a good idea.
1.5.1.1. Con: This should have been addressed in the bill's creation, not left to struggle after already being passed.
1.5.2. Pro: Bill negatively impacts law abiding [startups](http://www.engine.is/news/category/the-top-ten-myths-about-sestas-s-1693-impact-on-startups) in a range of fields from legal adult work, personals and meetups, photography, and more.
1.6. Pro: The bill has led to censorship of free speech, with accounts of people [even discussing](https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/30/congress-just-legalized-sex-censorship-what-to-know/) the topic being banned
1.6.1. Pro: The bill includes extensive [censorship](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/culture/2018/4/13/17172762/fosta-sesta-backpage-230-internet-freedom) potential for internet sites.
1.6.2. Con: The websites that have had their discussions affected by the bill are only those which [facilitated](https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2018/04/02/the-impact-of-fosta-sesta-on-online-sex-work-communities/) sex trafficking. It is legitimate to censor this speech, as it creates more harm than good for society.
1.7. Pro: The bill was [opposed](https://techpolicycorner.org/sesta-the-rush-to-pass-unconstitutional-counterproductive-legislation-43d034636c87) by Department of Justice.
1.7.1. Pro: The Department of Justice [identified](http://docs.techfreedom.org/DOJ_FOSTA_Letter.pdf) that the bill allowed for [ex post facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law) punishments of sex trafficking behaviour, which are unconstitutional and widely regarded as unjust.
1.8. Pro: Bill was [rushed](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/how-congress-censored-internet), without significant public / industry comment, in spite of its wide reaching implications.
1.8.1. Pro: The term "knowingly" used with reference to facilitation of sex trafficking in the bill is [not defined](https://www.wired.com/story/how-a-controversial-new-sex-trafficking-law-will-change-the-web/). This vagueness may create an incentive for websites to not moderate their services at all, so that they can deny knowledge of any wrongdoing.
