Discussion Title: Should Human Life Be Valued Above Animal Life?

1. Human life should be valued above animal life in the case that only one can be preserved.
1.1. Pro: Humans make the most valuable contributions to the world and therefore should be valued above animals.
1.1.1. Pro: Humans can imagine different possibilities. We can weave narratives. We can thus organise in far greater numbers and to much greater effect than other animals.
1.1.1.1. Con: Ability to impact the earth does not necessarily equate to value.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Most of the ways in which humans impact the Earth are negative, save for those which serve the short-term well-being of the human species.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: There are [cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Regan#Animal_rights) of humans that due to disability or coma seem unable to experience the world in all its supposed richness. Yet the life of these humans is valued. After all, animals and humans are [equally](http://www.animalethics.org.uk/subject-of-a-life.html) subjects and owners of a life.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Our understanding of the universe and our concept of beauty is a far more extensive and awe-inspiring one than animals are capable of creating or understanding, because we undoubtedly have greater collaborative and creative potential. Our lives are therefore more impactful and thus more valuable than those of other animals.
1.1.1.3. Con: A colony of ants generally consists of[300 to 2,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony#Colony_size) organised individuals, which is far more than humans achieve in their organisation.
1.1.2. Pro: Humans have the best understanding of ethics and morality, which is a vital aspect of creating a functional society.
1.1.2.1. Con: Ethics and morality are simply an extension of cooperation and reciprocity [found](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/cooperation-conflict-and-the-evolution-of-complex-13236526?TB_iframe=true&width=288&height=432&error=cookies_not_supported&code=70a26aea-3301-4273-8c0c-7eb3682a3b00) in many social species. While vital, it does not set us apart from other animals.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Ethics and morality go far beyond that. It’s one of the key aspects of humanity that have allowed for the development of the current state of human society, which goes far beyond the capabilities of any animal species. It is one of the greatest things setting us apart.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Historically, human ethics and morality have been used to create [in groups and outgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups). Further, ingroups fight outgroups and use moral justifications to perpetuate [wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades), [slavery](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/ethics/justifications.shtml), and [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism#Justification).
1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: They've also been used to create society as we know it today, and continue to be used to advance society in a better direction. Ethics constantly [improve over time](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/what-is-ethics/), allowing us to create a just and ethical society. It's not perfect, but without it, we wouldn't have been able to create a functioning society at all.
1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Moral relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism) is one of those improvements over time.
Moral Relativism is the position that moral or ethical propositions do not reflect objective or universal moral truths, but instead make claims relative to social, cultural, historical or personal circumstances. Meaning the ethics created by humans cannot be objective or "fair" to animals.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Animals may understand abstract concepts.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Behavioral analysis has shown that non-human animals understand abstract concepts such as monetary value systems and [make identical choices](https://youtu.be/DUd8XA-5HEk?t=8m53s) \(both rational and irrational\) to humans who are faced with the same situation.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: Animals can be trained to place value on things in their immediate environment, but they are incapable of understanding abstract concepts that do not pertain to their surroundings, as is the case with ethics and morality.
1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Humans also cannot understand abstract ideas without memory of objects and concepts that have been in their presence at some point \(usually introduced by another human\). This is a commonality of humans and non-human animals.
1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Humans have the unique ability to formulate entirely new ideas and abstract concepts—this ability lies at the bedrock of human civilization. Without it, we’d likely still be living in caves.
1.1.2.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: The purpose of schools is to create an environment where humans pass on knowledge by introducing facts, concepts, and critical thinking skills so that young humans can use these pre-introduced ideas to form novel ideas of their own.
1.1.2.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: [Feral](http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/16139/1/Modern-Cases-of-Feral-Children.html) human children demonstrate abstraction abilities on par with those of non-human animals. This is because they have not been enculturated/trained to by humans.
1.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Some non-human animals have been shown to [have object permanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence#In_animals), and the social complexity to  [differentiate ethnic groups by language](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160120-the-whales-that-speak-in-code), and [remember their distant friends and relatives despite spending most of their lives apart](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150707-the-whales-that-never-forgetc). We have no proof that they cannot maintain abstract ideas at a distance.
1.1.2.1.2.3.1. Con: Yet these are all things that have existed in their immediate presence at some point. It’s a matter of memory, not comprehension of abstract ideas.
1.1.2.1.2.4. Pro: Koko the gorilla makes art and has [opinions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCeVY30YEM0) about her art.
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Any social species that could not cooperate well would become a non-social species or would die out.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: This is not necessarily true. The concept of the 'survival of the fittest' dictates that only the strong may survive. An animal species may kill 95% of its own kind and continue to survive with only the strongest 5%.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: There is more to species evolution than an individual's fitness or ability to reproduce.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Species with higher numbers of '[altruists](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/altruism-selfishness-evolution-mathematics-princeton-bath-university-a7148471.html)’ are better able to survive.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: [Genetic drift, bottleneck effect, and founder effect](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/heredity-and-genetics/v/genetic-drift-bottleneck-effect-and-founder-effect) can effect the availability of traits in a population over time.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Food web ecology in the [predator-prey-cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYq2078_xqc) can result in one species going extinct through starvation if it adapts too well and over-hunts all its resources.
1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: If the animal is not capable of surviving and reproducing on its own, that is not true. Animals may form packs that attack and kill other packs of the same species. This is the survival of a social group that also engages in killing of its own kind.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Morality is one of they key things allowing humans to work together on a large scale. Without it, we never would have been able to construct massive cities, or fly to the moon.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Nothing points to morality as central to these accomplishments. One can just as easily claim that a desperate instinct for expansion or control drives humans to do these things.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: If that were true, we would have created continent-spanning advanced civilizations much earlier than we did. Our instincts have always been the same, and those instincts resulted in mostly small hunter-gatherer tribes. A sense of ethics and morality, however, has grown over time with humanity, mostly coinciding with the rise of civilization.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Major points in history advancing the ethical treatment of people, like the creation of the [Magna Carta](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Magna-Carta) and the [Law of the Twelve Tables](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Law-of-the-Twelve-Tables), often served as catalysts for the progression of society.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: The European powers' colonialization of the other continents was done in unethical ways.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Laws allow us to live and work together in large groups or toward common goals \(cities, space flight\). Legality should not be confused with morality/justice.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Our just legal system exists only because of morality. Truly immoral beings would have only created anarchy or totalitarianism.
1.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Our legal system exists out of necessity, because people have different morals than eachother, have common morals that are not productive \(such as revenge\), or feel free to violate the rights of people they have no emotional link to \(as in large cities or other countries\).
1.1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: Major law landmarks like the [Magna Carta](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Magna-Carta) and the [Law of the Twelve Tables](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Law-of-the-Twelve-Tables) were the result of civil unrest and disagreement over customary morals.
1.1.2.2.2.3. Pro: Some things which are legal are not moral.
1.1.2.2.2.3.1. Pro: Slavery was once legal.
1.1.2.2.2.3.1.1. Con: Ethics constantly [improve over time](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/what-is-ethics/), allowing things like slavery to lose their legal status due to advancements in human ethical understanding. The bedrock of laws we have today exist largely as a result of a consensus of morality, which will continue to improve into the future.
1.1.2.2.2.3.2. Pro: Some laws have no moral point, such as ["it is illegal for a man to knit during fishing season"](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weird-laws-in-america_us_56a264abe4b0d8cc1099e1cd).
1.1.2.3. Pro: The only values displayed by animals are those that contribute to their survival. They do not value the life of their prey unless they are specifically trained to, for example.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: People who own predatory pets as well as pets that are usually the prey of the predatory pet \(such as cats and birds\) usually train the predatory animal to not attack or kill the prey animal. This is the only case in which the cat will 'value' the life of the bird, insofar as they are trained to ignore their natural instincts.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: Wild lions sometimes "[adopt](https://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/653655/video-Lion-saves-calf-from-being-attacked)" prey animals for long periods of time.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: This is certainly unusual behavior, as it seems to only have been observed in one instance. This most likely is not a behavior present in the average lion. There are, however, several recorded instances of a lion [eating the mother](https://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/653655/video-Lion-saves-calf-from-being-attacked).
1.1.2.3.3. Con: Acts of altruism in non-human animals show that survival is not their only value.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Many species of animals instinctually engage in killing, infanticide and cannibalism. You can't apply human moral standards to animals; if you do, many animals would be considered evil.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: [Male lions and Hanuman Langurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide_\(zoology\)#Infanticide_involving_sexual_conflict), for example, will kill the offspring of another male in order to mate, allowing his genes to be dominant in the pack instead.
1.1.2.4.2. Con: Killing, [infanticide](https://aeon.co/essays/the-roots-of-infanticide-run-deep-and-begin-with-poverty), and [cannibalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannibalism) are/were practiced by humans. Those acts are not inherently "evil".
1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: The indigenous Wari people use [funerary cannibalism](http://anthreligion.commons.uaa.alaska.edu/funerary-rituals/wari-funerary-rituals/) as an expression of compassion, reverence and respect for the deceased and the family of the deceased. It is seen as helping the deceased move to the afterlife more quickly. In this case, cannibalism is considered the morally good thing to do.
1.1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Funerary cannibalism is very different on moral grounds from predatory cannibalism, as is the type displayed by some animals. Predatory cannibalism is still [murder](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Cannibalism#Ethical_Reflections_on_Cannibalism), while funerary cannibalism is not.
1.1.2.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: With funerary cannibalism, also known as '[endocannibalism'](https://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/wari/865), the deceased is not murdered to be consumed. Their body is consumed by members of their tribe/community as part of a funeral ritual after their death.
1.1.2.4.2.1.1.2. Con: Funerary cannibalism still points to the existence of situations in which cannibalism is not evil.
1.1.2.4.2.1.1.2.1. Con: While this is true, it does nothing to justify predatory cannibalism, which is widely recognized as an act of evil.
1.1.2.4.2.2. Con: [Modern ethical and religious beliefs](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Cannibalism#Ethical_Reflections_on_Cannibalism) state that these actions are evil.
1.1.2.4.2.3. Pro: [Moral Relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism) is the position that moral or ethical propositions do not reflect objective or universal moral truths, but instead make claims relative to social, cultural, historical or personal circumstances.
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: Many different species of animals have been observed engaging in [cannibalism.](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Cannibalism#Non-Human_Cannibalism) For some of them, like the praying mantis, it's even ingrained in the animal's instincts.
1.1.2.4.4. Con: Humans have committed much more elaborate and worse atrocities to other humans than animals.
1.1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Humans can actively and willingly participate in [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), as to which animals do not.
1.1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Humans Perform [experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731) on other living humans, in the name of science, where animals do not.
1.1.2.4.4.3. Pro: [Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag) ration food and starve each other in mass creating artificial famines and labor camps, where animals do not.
1.1.2.4.4.4. Pro: Various [policies and plans](https://www.heritage.org/asia/commentary/the-legacy-mao-zedong-mass-murder) aimed for greatness fell short resulting in executions, labor deaths, self-inflicted famine from over-killing animals, etc. Animals are currently not capable of such policies.
1.1.3. Con: Ants, bees and plankton are vastly more important to all life on earth than humans, who have caused the extinction of thousands of species.
1.1.3.1. Con: The value of these species in relation to life on Earth is irrelevant in other regards, such as technological advancement. One cannot assume life on Earth is the most important factor.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Technological advancement is ultimately only valuable to humans. In contrast, the ecological health of bees, ants, plankton and krill directly correlates to the health of millions of other species. Clearly that is more valuable.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Technological advancement is the only thing that could possibly save any life at all in the event of a global cataclysm. That is clearly more valuable than a healthy ecosystem for animals that will all eventually be wiped out by the sun expanding.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Humans are the most important species. What is important to humans is more important than whatever is important to animals.
1.1.4. Con: To claim this for a human-animal comparison, it should be true for a human-human comparison as well. By this logic, the life of a human with more potential \(or higher intelligence\) is worth more than the life of a human with less potential.
1.1.4.1. Con: Preferring the life of a more intelligent person over a less intelligent person in the case that only one may be preserved does not mean the less intelligent person becomes devalued or treated with less dignity.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: In a life-death situation, rescuing a renowned scientist or a doctor who has saved hundreds of lives would have more potential benefit then saving a drug-addicted man who molests his family. Sure, there is a slight chance that the drug addict could turn his life around, and that the scientist/doctor could go bad, but the chance is too small to influence the decision on average.
1.1.4.2. Con: As stated above, only a relevant and huge intelligence gap should be taken into account: small variances are fluctuating costantly and can change at any time. A cow cannot become a human. An uneducated human can become an Einstein.
1.1.5. Con: Humans have the potential to drastically improve human and animal life, but also to make it drastically worse. As we cannot know which one it's going to be, the neutral impact of an animal life is a better option.
1.1.5.1. Con: Humans have much more good potential than evil, and it is in their interest to keep life growing.
1.1.5.2. Con: “Better” is subjective. The neutral option is not objectively better in any way.
1.1.5.3. Con: Humans have been responsible for massive progress in the world. The achievements of humanity outweigh the errors, which is preferable to the static, unchanging world of nature.
1.1.6. Con: Humans cause more harm than good to the environment, so animals should be preserved over humans.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Humans are causing rapid climate change that could lead to the extinction of many species.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: Humans may be the solution to solving climate change as well as save endangered species.
1.1.6.1.2. Con: We know humans cause pollution. We [don't know for sure](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/02/08/420000-years-of-data-suggestss-global-warming-is-not-man-made/) if it's humans who cause the climate change or if it's a long term trend or just some anomaly. The climate itself is not constant even without human intervention.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Humans are a main cause of habitat destruction due to [deforestation](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/deforestation/), [overpopulation](http://www.everythingconnects.org/overpopulation-effects.html), and [depletion of natural resources](http://www.brighthub.com/environment/science-environmental/articles/68899.aspx).
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Humans may eventually provide other species the means to live beyond the Earth \(which at some point will no longer be habitable\).
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: As a result of habitat destruction, humans have already killed off several [species](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/extinctions-10-years_us_585243abe4b0732b82fef55f) of animals that only hurt ecosystems, the environment, and humans.
1.1.6.3. Con: Humanity is not uniformly destructive or constructive. There are humans whose net influence on the environment and the well-being of other species is positive.
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Many species would have ceased to exist completely without human interference in the past, like the [Ginkgo Biloba tree](http://e360.yale.edu/features/peter_crane_history_of_ginkgo_earths_oldest_tree\]).
1.1.6.3.2. Pro: Humans open nature reserves and try to preserve species from extinction \(not only due to other humans, but also natural disasters or phenomena\).
1.1.6.3.3. Pro: Man has genetically modified many domesticated animals to the point where survival without human help is not possible.
1.1.6.3.3.1. Pro: [English Bulldogs](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2016/08/05/why-breeding-bulldogs-borderline-inhumane/oXkhn20QASB8dS4bu5pA1N/story.html), like many genetically modified dog breeds, have many man-created health issues \(e.g. skeletal disorder, mandatory Caesarean sections, breathing disorders\) due to selective breeding for aesthetically-pleasing traits. This breed cannot survive without human intervention.
1.1.6.3.3.1.1. Con: English bulldogs are a breed, not a species. Without human intervention, English bulldogs would mate with other dogs and the maladaptive traits would slowly breed out \(there would no longer be an "English bulldog" breed of dog\).
1.1.6.4. Con: All species play an important part in sustaining the health of the biosphere, with one being no more valuable in one role than the next, including humans.
1.1.6.4.1. Con: The only reason that species don't tend to destroy one another is because they evolved alongside, and know how to deal with, each other. Invasive species show that all species care for themselves more than anything, often this is at the expense of the ecosystem.
1.1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Invasive species have the power to completely change an ecosystem, human and non-human alike.
1.1.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: Some species of [honeybees](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-06/10-spectacular-native-bees), brought to the US from parts of Europe have played a vital role in the pollination of produce grown for human consumption. Without them, much of US farmland would be barren.
1.1.6.4.1.1.2. Con: All invasive species are introduced into an environment largely due to the actions of humans. Therefore, it could be claimed that humans are the reason for change caused by invasive species, although, not always a "single human."
1.1.6.4.1.1.3. Con: The life of a single individual of an invasive species cannot have the impact of the life of a single human individual.
1.1.6.4.1.1.4. Con: Far from being a force for good, invasive species are often very destructive and therefore should not be saved.
1.1.6.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: Invasive species are a leading factor in freshwater fish extinction in the [US](https://www.fws.gov/verobeach/PythonPDF/CostofInvasivesFactSheet.pdf).
1.1.6.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: Some [invasive species](https://www.fws.gov/verobeach/PythonPDF/CostofInvasivesFactSheet.pdf) endanger other species through predation: Burmese pythons in Florida have decimated Wood storks and Key Largo woodrats, which are both federally endangered species.
1.1.6.4.1.1.4.3. Pro: [Nutria](https://www.fws.gov/verobeach/PythonPDF/CostofInvasivesFactSheet.pdf) destroy large areas of marshlands, causing significant landscape changes and erosion that threaten pollution and storm surge control, recreational and commercial fisheries, and habitats for native species.
1.1.6.4.1.1.4.4. Con: Many invasive species have [positive effects](https://www.wired.com/2011/02/good-invasives/) on their environment. For example, by restoring foliage, or filtering water.
1.1.6.4.1.1.5. Con: This only affects the ecosystem that has been invaded, though, and the invading species has no good or bad intentions. Humans can affect ecosystems across the globe simultaneously, with deliberately good intent, something no animal can do.
1.1.6.4.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.4.4.
1.1.6.4.2. Con: Some species contribute more to this planet than others and it is an important distinction when discussing intrinsic value.
1.1.6.4.2.1. Pro: Without ants, bees and [plankton](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/215na5_en.pdf) almost all life on earth would collapse. Certainly they are more valuable than ostriches \(for example\).
1.1.6.4.2.2. Pro: Some species, such as mosquitoes, seem to serve no valuable purpose other than as a pest or health risk.
1.1.6.4.2.2.1. Con: Mosquitoes provide population control through the health risks they carry.
1.1.6.4.2.2.1.1. Con: 'Population control' is only a euphemism for mass death and destruction. It has no benefit to the planet.
1.1.6.4.2.2.2. Con: Like any life on this Earth, mosquitoes serve as a intricate part of the food web for many species.
1.1.6.4.2.2.3. Con: Just because they are considered pests to humans, does not mean they do not serve a purpose on Earth.
1.1.6.4.2.2.4. Pro: Scientists agree that the niche left behind if mosquitoes were [eradicated](https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100721/full/466432a.html) would likely be filled by other species.
1.1.6.4.2.3. Con: Many species of animals contribute significantly to functions of nature and arguably are just as important as humans for the planet. Each niche of the environment, filled with animals as well as humans, is important.
1.1.6.4.2.4. Pro: The human species contributes massive environmental damage to the planet far exceeding the contribution of any other organism.
1.1.6.4.3. Pro: Humans and many animal species have a [symbiotic relationship](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/sociology/the-relationship-between-humans-animals-and-plants-sociology-essay.php) between them, and intertwined with other species, benefiting the survival of all.
1.1.6.5. Con: Humans should be valued over animals, as we are the only ones capable of caring for Earth and resolving the damage we've done.
1.1.6.5.1. Con: Just because we are capable of resolving the damages done, does not mean we are morally obligated to do so by preserving ourselves over others.
1.1.6.5.1.1. Con: To recognise moral imperatives, humanity must recognise that it is superior in moral ability and knowledge to other species. This is not the same as saying 'because we can do something, we must do it', but instead that 'if we want to escape a sort of 'eco moral nihilist' moral philosophy \(i.e. nothing is good or bad, it is just 'ecology as normal'\) humanity must recognise it is not a part of 'ecology as normal'.
1.1.6.5.2. Con: There is no guarantee that humans will do more good than harm. The very damage that we've done \(anthropogenic climate change, factory farming, exploitation, and oppression\) suggest that humans may in the future do far more harm than good.
1.1.6.5.2.1. Con: There is no effective measure to confirm humans will do more harm than good based on the existence of things.
1.1.6.5.3. Con: The Earth doesn't need humans to take care of it.
1.1.6.5.4. Con: Humanity's only true contributions to this world are either for our own benefit, or to clean up our own messes. We don't really fit into the natural order and balance that governs most of the Earth's lifeforms.
1.1.6.5.5. Con: Our own importance does not affect how the rest of the world is affected by our actions.
1.1.6.5.6. Pro: Humanity's influence over the larger biosphere far exceeds that of all other animals.
1.1.6.5.6.1. Pro: Human technology enables an individual's influence to extend far beyond their natural, biological influence or emissions. To be the species wielding this influence automatically centralises humans in the question of the biosphere's fate.
1.1.6.5.7. Pro: Humans are intelligent enough to figure out how to help protect animals.
1.1.6.5.7.1. Pro: For example, humans may find a way to live on other planets or places in the universe to allow animals to live on earth peacefully.
1.1.6.6. Con: Animals and plants, like [oak wilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_wilt) and [mosquitoes](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/malaria-affects-animals-as-well-as-humans/3130296) both contribute to destroying the planet. It is not humans alone.
1.1.6.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.2.2.1.
1.1.6.6.2. Con: The environmental harm humans do affects many species. Oak wilt effects only oaks.
1.1.6.6.2.1. Con: Oak wilt only infects oak, but the effects of it can rapidly kill habitat for the animals who inhabit it.
1.1.6.6.3. Pro: The dynamic between humans and the rest of the environment is the same as that between any other species and the rest of the environment. It is always one of competition over resources, with specialization and symbiosis only where those bring competitive advantage.
1.1.6.7. Con: Preserving animals at the expense of humans would realistically cause the human race to die out.
1.1.6.7.1. Con: Humans are not the keystone/end line product of the world, so their survival is not essential to the survival of the earth. Therefore there is no global value in prioritising humans.
1.1.6.7.1.1. Con: There is no end line product of the Earth but that which is determined to have value by a conscious agent - that is, humans.
1.1.6.7.2. Pro: Humans test their medical advances on animals. In a world where animal life is valued above human life, that research would be seriously compromised.
1.1.6.7.3. Pro: Humans rely on animals for food - from consumption of animal meat to use of animal products for cheese and other products: in a world where animal life is valued above human life, those food sources would not be available.
1.1.6.7.3.1. Con: Global vegetarianism is far more sustainable than meat consumption. Indeed the UN [has said](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet) that a "vegan diet is vital to save the world from hunger, fuel poverty and the worst impacts of climate change."
1.1.6.7.4. Pro: Humans have relatively low reproduction rates compared to most animals. Favoring the lives of any one of the many short-lived but rapidly-reproducing animal species would likely result in a gradual diminishing of the human population, replaced by an overpopulation of such animals. This may result in a shortage of the resources and space required to sustain a major human population.
1.1.6.8. Con: Humans are the only species capable of making preserving efforts to protect other species, thus the human species value gets compounded by all the species that can be protected by them.
1.1.6.8.1. Con: By the same token, the human species value gets compounded and devalued by all the species it has destroyed, hurt, caused the extinction of and damaged irrevocably.
1.1.6.8.2. Pro: In the long term, and with the right culture, humans can protect other animals from disease, natural disasters and extinction. Animals cannot protect humans or other animals the same way.
1.1.6.8.3. Pro: Humans are the only organisms known to have developed advanced technology, and therefore are capable of saving lives of species and bringing extinct species back to life, as opposed to any other organism.
1.1.6.8.4. Pro: Many humans actively try to conserve the environment and participate in programs to improve ecological health.
1.1.6.8.4.1. Con: Plastic waste, generated by humans, is responsible for the death of [100 million](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/marine-animals-are-dying-because-of-our-plastic-trash/) marine mammals each year. Although humans have created initiatives to help resolve this, efforts are not enough currently to see a positive decrease in production and increase lives saved.
1.1.7. Pro: Civilization is a product of humanity, possible only because of human language and capacity to weigh and compare possible future states in making arrangements and in taking action.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Civilization is a unique good in that it allows a '[Lamarckian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism) ' sort of evolution, via memes and ideas which are allowed to fail or die in place of actual bodies or persons.
1.1.8. Con: By this statement, when we get to the point that AI will contribute more value than humans, it would be valued above humans.
1.1.9. Pro: Humanity currently holds the greatest potential to unravel the mysteries of our universe, traverse stars and recreate life itself with cloning technology. We are unlikely to see such great technological advances again for many millions of years, if at all, should the human race perish \(due to the time needed for another intelligent species to evolve\).
1.1.9.1. Con: It is unclear why this matters at all. Humans would consider these achievements good, but that does not make them an objective good, or good from the perspective of an animal.
1.1.9.1.1. Pro: As humans gain more knowledge over time, we often find out things that we once believed were "progress" instead had a negative effect.
1.1.9.1.1.1. Pro: Many hygiene products [used to contain radioactive substances](http://www.messynessychic.com/2015/07/02/the-radium-girls-and-the-generation-that-brushed-its-teeth-with-radioactive-toothepaste/) until we learned that radiation was unhealthy.
1.1.9.1.2. Pro: The potential to unravel universal mysteries, explore said universe, or make any other number of technological advancements is irrelevant in the eyes of non-human animals. There does not exist an animal that would voluntarily die to benefit the goals of humanity.
1.1.9.1.2.1. Con: Animals show [altruistic](http://goodnature.nathab.com/is-animal-altruism-real/) behavior, indicating that they can sometimes care for or do favors for other animals, even outside their own species.
1.1.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.2.
1.1.9.1.2.1.2. Pro: There are several reported accounts of animals [rescuing](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/stories-of-amazing-animal-heroes/) the lives of others.
1.1.9.1.2.1.3. Pro: There [are](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5048970/Parrot-saved-todlers-life-with-warning.html) [many](https://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphins-rescuing-humans/) [cases](https://www.thedodo.com/6-endearing-tales-of-animals-r-683603429.html) of non-human animals being altruistic to creatures that have no impact on their survival.
1.1.9.1.2.1.3.1. Con: There is no way to prove that the animals were consciously aware of the fact that the other creature would have no impact on its survival.
1.1.9.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Some animals' behavior shows they are aware of what actions humans and other non-human animals take and how it might effect their chances of survival.
1.1.9.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Crows](https://corvidresearch.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/swift_marzluff_crows.pdf?utm_campaign=newsletter_84&utm_medium=email&amp) scold, mob, or avoid people who kills pigeons, but not as much as they scold, mob, or avoid people who kill crows.
1.1.9.1.2.1.3.1.1.2. Con: They may be especially aware of things that impact their survival, yet they are still fallible and limited. They can be wrong. If this wasn't the case, animals would never be killed by other animals. Similarly, there may be cases where they think something benefits their survival when it actually doesn't.
1.1.9.1.2.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Both humans and non-human animals are capable of making decisions that are fallible \(negatively impact their chances of survival\).
1.1.9.1.2.1.4. Con: Altruism is often guided by survival, as an animal will seek to preserve the life of another that it deems helpful to its own survival, as is the case in [symbiotic relationships](https://www.britannica.com/science/mutualism-biology).
1.1.9.1.2.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.1.3.
1.1.9.1.2.1.5. Con: [Altruism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/) as humans know it and as animals display are not the same. In a biological sense, many acts of altruism in nature are made by creatures that are presumably not capable of conscious thought.
1.1.9.1.2.1.5.1. Con: Because we have not yet [defined consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness#Defining_consciousness), we do not know what animals are or are not capable of conscious thought.
1.1.9.1.2.1.5.1.1. Con: Consciousness most likely exists on a spectrum and value should be afforded respectively.
1.1.9.1.2.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Humans have the capacity to experience a wider spectrum of pleasure/suffering than other animals.
1.1.9.1.2.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: It is not proven that humans have any greater capacity to experience pleasure and suffering than animals.
1.1.9.1.2.1.5.2. Pro: Altruism, to be genuine, must be a conscious choice. An animal displaying altruism as directed by its instincts does not constitute genuine altruism.
1.1.9.1.2.1.5.3. Con: Animals are capable of recognizing danger and overcoming instincts to risk that danger to save others. These are the same standards we use to measure human conscious choice. Therefore, animals have equivalent conscious choice.
1.1.9.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.8.
1.1.9.1.3. Pro: Objectively speaking, what a species does has no impact on the value of their life.
1.1.9.1.4. Con: But they are subjectively good to humans, who are the ones deciding on this.
1.1.9.1.5. Pro: Like all species of life upon this planet, our potential isn't measured by what we mean to the universe, but what it means to us. Therefore 'importance' and 'potential' are relative to the species. Are we more important?  Yes, but only to ourselves. We can only buy into something we've learned the value of.
1.1.9.1.5.1. Con: Only humanity has a sense of importance and potential. Animals are incapable of even comprehending such concepts, so practically only our own perspective on the issue exists.
1.1.9.1.6. Con: Objectivity doesn’t exist, per se, as humans can only see through their point of view.
1.1.9.2. Pro: Humans may develop technologically to such an extent that we can liberate all animals from suffering, in which case it would be immoral to put an end to the human race before this occurs and thus allow animal suffering to continue indefinitely.
1.1.9.2.1. Con: This technology may never be realized before the animals are beyond a point of re-population. We cannot cause an indefinite amount of harm for a potential benefit such as this, considering both the improbability and resources that would be necessary.
1.1.9.2.2. Con: Humans are the ones who are causing the suffering.
1.1.9.2.2.1. Con: Given the amount of death and extinction that happened before humans came along, this is demonstrably false, even if humans have had some detrimental effects for some species.
1.1.9.3. Con: Not all humans are able to contribute to the world at this level, while many more humans can contribute negatively to the environment and biosphere.
1.1.9.4. Pro: Humans provide the best chance for life to spread beyond the confines of Earth, so humans are good for life in general.
1.1.9.4.1. Pro: Human life is put in danger by global extinction events as long as it resides on only one planet.
1.1.9.4.2. Con: The imperative to "spread life" implies that preserving life is moral. If preserving life is moral, then preserving animal life is moral.
1.1.9.4.2.1. Con: Harmful viruses and bacteria are life. If we are valuing all life forms equally, it would imply we should not treat sick and ailing people or animals.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1. Con: The parent claim is a reductio ad absurdum. Using common sense, proponents of animal rights will not claim that the life of viruses and bacteria are to have the same moral value as sentient beings such as mice, lizards, cats, dogs, cows, gorillas, etc. The keyword here is "moral" as this is the type of value that matters in discussions about rights and equality.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Reductio ad absurdum is a legitimate argument. To avoid it in this particular case, you'd have to find a line between "valuable life" and "invaluable life", which should prove difficult.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Life does not exist in definite categories—it is a gradient. Any line determining when minor life becomes valuable will be completely arbitrary.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Either all life is valuable, no life is valuable, or value is not equal among life and depends on the characteristics of the life in question. The final possibility precludes the idea of valuing any animal on the same level as a human, as no animals are the same as humans.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is no other creature on the planet with the self-awareness, consciousness and ability to completely ignore instinct and act with such a high degree of free will. This makes us more advanced, filled with incredible potential, and thus more valuable compared to animal life.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Many animal species experience a range of [emotions](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201306/universal-declaration-animal-sentience-no-pretending) such as happiness, resentment, joy, sadness, empathy, and even PTSD.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: While many animals can experience pain and emotion, many lack the complex problem solving capacity the frontal cortex allows in humans. Emotion is only one facet of cognitive ability and when using cognitive functions as a reason to decide value all cognitive functions should be considered.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Humans are biologically similar enough and exhibit strikingly similar behaviors \(e.g. language, laughter, jealousy, pride\), that we assume a core set of analogous experiences. Transferring this notion to animals is based on a much smaller set of evidence mostly involving microbiological inputs, as opposed to complex behavioral outputs.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Humans are not the only animals that have shown love. Elephants, for example, have shown [remorse](https://www.livescience.com/24800-animals-emotions-morality.html) for other elephants that have died.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: An average human life has more meaning and depth than an average animal life. If we use meaning and depth to evaluate life, then human life should be valued above animal life.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Humans create and execute ideas, whereas animals just breed and hunt. It's like comparing the value of complex literature to basic sentences.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: This implies that life worthiness is given by 'value' which is a simplistic view of things. Even if the 'value' scale is accepted, it does not specify in relation to what the 'value' is calculated.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: This also makes us incredibly destructive. Free will, when not combined with empathy and long-term rational planning is not necessarily better than instinct.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Something like long-term rational planning can only exist in the presence of free will. A world of instinct is naturally chaotic, and may only be destructive. Free will allows for both destructive and constructive behavior, and they balance each other out.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Humanity has done much more creating than destroying, as evidenced by the existence of so many massive cities around the world.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: It cannot be demonstrated that humans are objectively superior to other animals. "Superiority" is a relative term, similar to "well adapted". A goal must be defined in order for someone to be best at it.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Humans and fish, for example, are superior than the other in some skills. Therefore, it cannot be said that humans are superior in absolute terms to other animals.
1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Superiority, in this case, refers to dominance. This is an objective metric. Humans are at the top of the food chain, so much so that we transcend it entirely. We control the goings-on of our world to a point that no other species comes even remotely close.
1.1.9.4.2.1.2. Pro: Antibiotics are strong medicines that treat bacterial infections by killing off bacteria.
1.1.9.4.2.1.3. Pro: Historically, both humans and other species have had a rule of thumb, of 'your own species first'. This is why the life of your own species is superior. This doesn't empower you to be cruel.
1.1.9.4.2.1.4. Con: While all life is not equal, consciousness and the ability to feel pain is undeniably restricted to humans and animals. This similarity obligates humans to strive to avoid and abolish human and animal suffering alike.
1.1.9.4.2.1.4.1. Con: Abolishing suffering is utopia. Abolishing unjustified suffering is moral. Killing animals to survive is not unjustified.
1.1.9.4.2.1.5. Con: Valuing all life would still have to be considered from various ethical scales before being implied. Bacteria are not known as sensible instead of humans, and their species is not endangered by killing them.
1.1.9.4.2.1.5.1. Pro: Regarding the ecosystemic ethical scale, we have to preserve a species if its disparition endanger an ecosystem.
1.1.9.4.2.1.5.2. Pro: Regarding the species ethical scale, we have to preserve individuals if there disparation endanger them as species.
1.1.9.4.3. Con: The parent claim presupposes that life doesn't exist beyond Earth, which has not yet been confirmed and perhaps, due to the infinite nature of the Universe, can never be confirmed even if we keep looking for life and not finding it in outer space. Chances are that life exists elsewhere in the Cosmos and there is a possibility, even if a tiny one, that a more evolved species than ours exists already.
1.1.9.4.4. Pro: It is well-known that eventually the sun will expand and engulf the Earth, eliminating all life on it. Humanity is the best hope of creating the technology to ensure continued existence of the rare life on Earth far into the future.
1.1.9.4.4.1. Pro: More pressingly than the threat posed by the sun, a mass \(or even a complete\) extinction could be caused by meteors, volcanoes, viruses, or perhaps future human-like life. Currently only humankind's technology and organizational abilities could prevent or anticipate such a threat.
1.1.9.4.5. Pro: We don't know how rare life is. As far as we know, Earth may contain the only life in the universe. If humans fail to expand life to other planets, a mass extinction event could be the end of all life in the universe. It is thus imperative that humans are prioritized above all other species, as humans may be the only chance for biological life to exist into the distant future.
1.1.9.4.6. Con: That is a goal for humans. An animal doesn't care if it lives on Earth or Mars.
1.1.9.4.6.1. Con: However, an animal does care about whether it and its genetic lineage lives or dies, and having descendants on more than one planet increases the chances of this survival.
1.1.9.4.6.1.1. Con: We humans do not know what animals care about and what their opinions or feelings are because we cannot communicate properly with animals. They do not have a language that is complex enough and expressive so that they can understand and develop abstract concepts and therefore lack the ability to create thoughts that could relay what animals really want and how they reason.
1.1.9.4.6.2. Pro: If animals do not care if they are alive on Earth or Mars, it suggests that human life is more valuable than animal life. Taking a stance on such a topic requires some attributes which animals lack compared to humans.
1.1.9.4.6.3. Pro: We take "life" as something inherently good and "death" as something inherently bad. Therefore we see value in the idea of spreading to other planets to survive longer. If we see dying and living both as part of a process, there is no saying if spreading to other planets is a good or a bad thing. The extinction of the human race might as well be part of a process that we are the only beings capable of feeling anxious about.
1.1.9.4.7. Con: It will not have been worth the sacrifice if we destroy the earth or a multitude of species go extinct before we get to an alien planet.
1.1.9.4.7.1. Pro: Many humans could die before humanity's ability to spread life to other worlds becomes realised.
1.1.9.4.7.1.1. Con: If we don't properly emphasize the value of human life over non-human life, we may lose the moral ability to spread life even if we get to the technology to do it.
1.1.9.4.7.1.1.1. Pro: [Space advocacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_advocacy) have been largely based on the responsibility of mankind to preserve specifically itself.
1.1.9.4.7.1.1.2. Pro: An example may be robotic laws: if we put the animal life at the same level as the astronaut life in the program of a life-supporting machine, in case of a perilous emergency it may save 100 cattle lives and let the few astronauts die, without realizing that there is no chance to ever create a new colony or even maintain the life-supporting machine on the long term without actual humans.
1.1.9.4.7.1.2. Con: If we don't value properly human life, we may "accidentally" eliminate mankind before we get the technology to spread life to other worlds.
1.1.9.4.7.1.3. Con: "Many" is imprecise, therefore morally and politically risky to consider.
1.1.9.4.7.2. Con: That is a matter of opinion: one's opinion could be yes, if they believe intelligence or sentience to be the prime trait that confers moral worth to a being.
1.1.9.4.7.3. Con: Natural selection and natural disasters are responsible for more destruction and death \(we just call it "change"\) than humanity can ever accomplish as the dominant species on the planet. On the other hand we do actively work against the destruction/deterioration of Earth, and even keep many species of animals, that would go extinct without us, in the game for a little while longer.
1.1.9.4.8. Con: Human life spreading may not be what is best for the universe based on how we treat the limited resources we have available to us on Earth.
1.1.9.4.8.1. Con: As far as we can observe, the universe has [infinite resources](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm).
1.1.9.4.9. Con: Humans are the most dangerous species that can destroy the whole biosphere.
1.1.9.4.10. Con: Life also spreads across planets without human interference.
1.1.9.4.10.1. Pro: If the goal is simply to spread life beyond Earth, humans have the best chance of spreading life by sending germs or non-human animals such as the [tardigrade](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14690-water-bears-are-first-animal-to-survive-space-vacuum/)-- which are better adapted to variations in environment.
1.1.9.4.10.2. Pro: Technically a meteorite collision with Earth capable of propelling enough organic material out of Earth's gravity well can seed life in its most primitive to other planets in a few billion years. Admittedly not an ideal alternative.
1.1.9.4.10.2.1. Con: It's highly improbable because of the huge set of required conditions for it to appear \(survive impact, travel, get to proper place in cosmos...\) and keep those organisms alive for enough time to assure life would continue.
1.1.9.4.10.3. Con: Not in any meaningful way. Some bacterium floating through space on an asteroid will never be able to establish a society living on a foreign planet. No animal has the capacity for that either; only human beings. If there are ever to be civilizations spanning galaxies, they will exist only because of the human race.
1.1.9.4.10.3.1. Con: Evolutionary biologists generally agree that humans and other living species [descended](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100513-science-evolution-darwin-single-ancestor/) from bacteria-like ancestors about two billion years ago.
1.1.9.4.10.3.1.1. Con: The requirements for life to exist are [extremely specific](https://lco.global/spacebook/what-are-requirements-life-arise-and-survive/), which supports the theory that bacteria wouldn't be able to develop into an advanced civilization without external assistance.
1.1.9.4.10.4. Pro: Alien microorganisms have been [found](http://www.newsweek.com/russian-astronaut-says-alien-life-found-space-station-did-not-come-earth-724445) in the Earth's outer atmosphere.
1.1.9.4.10.4.1. Con: This claim has been [refuted](https://www.popsci.com/alien-bacteria-international-space-station#page-2). It is now assumed these bacteria come from earth, even if they may have attached themselves to the ISS at some point.
1.1.10. Con: Using the same rationale, humans are also making the most horrible contributions to the world through pollution, and mass destruction of life and environments. This would justify prioritising animal life over humans. So 'valuable contributions' is an arbitrary argument that should not be used to defend the claim.
1.1.10.1. Con: This is whataboutism: the damage humans cause to the planet is undeniable. However, the planet is only worth saving insofar as there are entities that are able to attribute worth to it. The extent to which other animals can do this is undoubtedly, and massively, inferior.
1.1.10.1.1. Con: The planet does not need to be saved as it had been thriving before humanity and will continue to do if humans go extinct. Humans are biological beings who rely on nature's resources and systems. Therefore, even if one claims that the ability to attribute worth to existence makes the human species superior, superiority has to manifest in rational actions that contribute to our own species' survival which undoubtedly starts by attributing worth to the existence of all species equally.
1.1.10.1.2. Con: We cannot know for sure what value other animals attribute to Earth and its environment. Possibly, such attributions of value are beyond comparison because each species experiences the world differently and according to its own biological and mental characteristics.
1.1.10.2. Con: Humans dominate the world more than ever. Population is rising continuously and our ability to survive is also improving continuously. It's safe to assume that humans make mostly successful contributions for things we care about most.
1.1.10.2.1. Con: Humans are more prosperous than other species, but that doesn't mean that human contributions to the world are better.
1.1.10.3. Pro: Humans are responsible for global warming, not exactly a valuable contribution.
1.1.11. Pro: We are dependent on our cooperation for survival and advancement, and as long as it is that way, we will value humans above animals.
1.1.11.1. Con: Humans are capable of cooperating with non-human animals and may value such a non-human animal over their own life or other human lives.
1.1.11.1.1. Pro: Houseless persons sometimes prefer to [stay outside](http://www.lifewithdogs.tv/2012/05/homeless-with-dog-man-refuses-shelter/) with their dog in severely cold weather rather than go to a shelter that does not allow dogs.
1.1.11.1.2. Pro: Some people who consider a pet part of their family often value that pet's life over humans they've never met.
1.1.11.1.2.1. Pro: A person might pay a $3,000 vet bill, but not donate $3,000 to pay for healthcare for sick or starving humans in other countries.
1.1.11.1.2.2. Pro: In a [philosophy experiment](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201308/is-dogs-life-worth-more-persons), 40% of people said they would save their pet, rather than a human foreigner, if both were equally likely to be hit and killed by a bus.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1. Con: This is a decision made from emotion, not logic. Logic dictates that the human's life is more valuable.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Humans are intrinsically, by nature, of greater value than other animals, because humans have free will and the ability to choose 'good'.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: We have no proof that 'free will' is different from the chemical processes going on in the brains of non-human animals.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Free will can be objectively determined through behavioral analysis. The key factor is the unique ability for humans to make [arbitrary decisions about abstract concepts.](https://mobile.nytimes.com/1999/07/07/opinion/l-the-chimps-don-t-have-free-will-497746.html)
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.1.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: A value of an animal is measured in what the animal can do or is for a human. Some animals are great emotional and spiritual companions, some are delicious food, others are key elements in the animal food chain, etc. In any of these cases, animals can be replaced relatively easy. A human life is irreplaceable, and the benefits another human brings to us are many and important to our well being, protection, companionship, etc.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.4. Con: Animals have free will too, but lack the intelligence and experience to practice it as often as humans.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.5. Pro: Humans intrinsically assign more value to other human lives, then to animal lives.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: In a situation where one would have to choose between saving a dear family member or close friend, or a pet one loves, most people would chose the former. So the love for a fellow human outweighs love for an animal companion.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.6. Con: Free will doesn't factor into it, we just have a better understanding of our nature and are less limited in controlling our instinctive responses to situations.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.7. Con: Animals can be trained to ignore instincts also, so the potential for free will is also present in them.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.8. Con: Elephants have been shown to mourn and remember long enough to eventually [take revenge](https://www.upi.com/Study-Elephants-might-seek-revenge/75691140108811/) on human settlements. This is an expression of free will.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.8.1. Con: Revenge, in this case, is an act of survival. It proves that elephants have long memories, but not that they took revenge by their own volition. Their instincts could have identified the human settlement as a threat to survival, so the next time the elephant encountered the settlement, its instincts directed it to attack.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.11.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Human-human relationships are generally far more enriching and full of potential than human-animal relationships.
1.1.11.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.2.1.
1.1.11.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.2.1.
1.1.11.2. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.
1.1.11.3. Con: We need to distinguish between instrumental and intrinsic value. A basic principle of ethics is that moral worth comes from intrinsic rather than instrumental worth. If we really value a friend, for instance, we value them for themselves, not for how they can be useful to us.
1.1.11.4. Pro: Animal testing, using leather for products such as shoes, consumption of meat: we do such things because it benefits us in various ways. This shows that we value the average human above the average animal. It's especially important in less developed places, where replacement is hardly available.
1.1.11.5. Con: Some people do not need to depend on cooperation for survival and advancement in their perspective due to social, economical and/or environmental factors, thus, partially negating their need to value humans life above animals.
1.1.12. Con: One can only define valuable as something good from the perspective of humans and cannot declare if our actions are equally valuable for all living beings.
1.1.12.1. Con: Since non-human animals can't judge what is valuable or not, this topic is not relevant. If only humans can make such evaluation, then only human evaluation may be considered.
1.1.12.1.1. Con: It cannot be said with certainty that non-humans can't judge value, since we do not have a proper way of communicating with other species.
1.1.12.1.1.1. Con: There are, in fact, many methods of complex inter-species communications. Through this communication, we can prove that human intelligence is still far beyond even the smartest of animals.
1.1.12.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [African Gray Parrot](http://www.allpetbirds.com/african-grey-parrot) can be taught human language with a vocabulary of up to 1,500 words, and can speak with the intelligence of a five year-old human child.
1.1.12.1.1.1.2. Pro: Apes have been taught to communicate with humans through the use of sign language. This language is well suited to apes, as they have relatively advanced hands. They are not, however, able to communicate nearly as well as humans can due to the limits of their intelligence, which all animals face.
1.1.12.1.1.1.3. Pro: A human with a limited ability to speak \(in a foreign language for example\) can still handle a complex debate about highly abstract philosophical notions \(freedom, intelligence, morality, existence...\) because he has such notions in his mind.  More than the level of communication, animals have not been able to debate with such complexity while communicating with humans, so far.
1.1.12.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Most humans cannot handle a complex debate in a language they are not fluent in. They do not have the vocabulary, grammar, or syntax.

Further, different cultures [conceive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) of abstract concepts differently, even when the same word is used to describe them.
1.1.12.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Different cultures have different ideas about how [time](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-we-make-sense-of-time/) exists in space.
1.1.12.1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Different languages have different conceptual metaphors. For example, when we say "The flat tire cost me an hour", you must already have the preconceived metaphor that "time is money" in order to understand it.
1.1.12.1.1.2. Pro: An elephant, for example, will protect its young by any means if it was faced with danger. This can communicate to the predator/danger that the elephant's young is valuable.
1.1.12.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.1.
1.1.12.2. Pro: The value of anything is relative to the point of reference. From our human perspective, the value of human life should be above any animal life.
1.1.12.2.1. Pro: Humans value human life over that of other animals simply because we are humans. If we were lions, we would value lion life above all else. Morality has little to do with it. We are not anymore or any less important than any other species out there.
1.1.12.2.1.1. Con: Many species [eat their own kind, including mating partners and children](http://theweek.com/articles/464891/7-animals-that-eat-kind). This shows that animals don't necessarily value the life of their own species any more than they would a prey animal. Humans, however, tend to favor other humans much more than animals do their own species.
1.1.12.2.1.1.1. Con: Killing one's own species is not a good test of value preference. Humans also kill their own kind, for a variety of reasons. Yet we still seem to show a preference for the survival of our own species over other species.
1.1.12.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.1.12.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.
1.1.12.2.1.1.1.3. Con: Across every society, killing is generally seen negatively, and humans make attempts to reduce it as much as possible. No animal makes any attempt to stop others of their own kind from killing each other, beyond saving themselves or their own group.
1.1.12.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Animals often relocate, go into hiding, or hunt at different times in order to avoid their group being killed. Their ways of reducing killing does not have to mirror the ways humans do for it to exist.
1.1.12.2.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Human laws prohibiting killing are also in place to save themselves and their own group, just as with non-human animals.
1.1.12.2.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Chimps perform group-[stability policing](https://www.thelocal.ch/20120309/2787) similarly to humans.
1.1.12.2.1.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: That fails to explain the willingness of police officers and soldiers to die so that people they don't even know may survive. Animals do not display this level of virtue.
1.1.12.2.1.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.
1.1.12.2.1.1.1.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.12.2.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.1.12.2.2. Con: Humans value things closer to them more. We should not mandate giving more value to either human or animal life \(Unless of course, you have promised one way or the other - like if you are a doctor or a fire-fighter\). So, it should be perfectly reasonable for you to save an animal if you love it more \(or have any other reason\) than the human. Of course, the morality of your choice will depend on how good the reason is.
1.1.12.3. Pro: Spiders would judge that webs are more valuable and therefore more important, just as bees would judge the same about honey.
1.1.12.4. Con: Human achievements may have no meaning outside humanity, but there are no animal achievements at all. Only humans are capable of making any real achievements. These are achievements that impact 7 billion sentient beings. That is no small meaning. And if we were ever to discover another sentient species somewhere in the universe, our achievements would, in fact, mean something to them.
1.1.12.4.1. Con: Achievements are subjective. Animals and aliens may have different goals than humans, so our achievements would not necessarily be 'achievements' to them.
1.1.12.4.1.1. Con: The goal of any animal is to survive. Many of humanity's achievements in the fields of medicine and technology have allowed animals to survive when they wouldn’t have otherwise.
1.1.12.4.1.2. Pro: A human achievement that uses up the habitat of a species, thus pushing it to extinction would likely not be considered a worthwhile achievement to members of that species.
1.1.12.4.2. Con: Humans, more than any other known animal, have created a net-loss in Earth's ecology.
1.1.12.5. Pro: Animals can't speak for themselves about what is more or less valuable. We are both judges and executioners for that matter. In a grand perspective, we can not declare globally for all species, if what we do is valuable equally for all living beings.
1.2. Pro: Assessing value is a uniquely human capability, therefore the human point of view determines what is valuable and should naturally preserve humanity.
1.2.1. Con: The ability to assess value is not uniquely human.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Many animals seem to [value life](https://www.thedodo.com/6-endearing-tales-of-animals-r-683603429.html). This could be seen as a universal value system.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Animals are incapable of understanding abstract concepts like value and morality. They may seek to preserve life in the case that it may benefit them, but they also show no remorse in taking a life when it benefits them. Their only values are those that contribute to their survival.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Living things do not need to understand abstract concepts to show that they value something.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There are many people who may not understand abstract concept, yet are able to express their value of something.
1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The existence of entire species across the globe is an abstract concept, and the value placed on humans or animals on this global scale is a uniquely human ability.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The same can be said of humans. The concept of shared values or morals benefits the group and in effect the individual member. Humans are thus simply somewhat more sophisticated animals.
1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: A first-time hunter often feels remorse for killing the animal, despite the benefit that killing the animal provides. Bears are not known to display any remorse the first time they kill a fish, nor are wolves when they kill a deer. This is only the tip of the iceberg into the complex \(and often conflicting\) human psyche in the case of morality and guilt; a level of complexity not remotely approached by any animal.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: This in no way proves that animals hold personal beliefs about the universal values of other species.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: The ability to value something depends on the ability to predict positive and negative experiences. Humans attribute positive or negative value to something to the extent that humans believe it brings positive or negative experiences. This ability is not uniquely human, but widespread in the animal kingdom.
1.2.1.2. Con: Religion is a system of assigning value to things outside our immediate concern, something animals are not capable of. Only humans utilize such universal value systems. Because the only belief system that can compare the value of animal life and human life is that of humans, that is the only system that may be used.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: Although animal religion may not be the same as human religion, it has been [shown](http://religiondispatches.org/what-if-animals-believe-in-god/) that certain species could be conducting religious rituals or seem to worship a deity or being, such as [chimpanzees](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/mysterious-chimpanzee-behaviour-could-be-sacred-rituals-and-show-that-chimps-believe-in-god-a6911301.html).
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Monkeys throwing rocks in tree crevices is a far stretch from ‘religion.’ If anything, they do it for fun. This does not indicate in any way that these primates are capable of moral judgement.
1.2.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.1.
1.2.1.2.4. Pro: Animals do not need religion nor a belief system in the way humans do to discern what should be valuable to them. Their instincts guide them towards what is necessary for their survival.
1.2.1.3. Pro: At least we cannot prove if value is uniquely human, as it is impossible to question animals about it.
1.2.1.4. Pro: It may well be that every living being has the capability to assess value. We haven't met living beings from other parts of the universe yet. Most people cannot communicate with trees or the Earth to gather their opinions either. That doesn't mean they have none. Nonexistence of evidence is not an evidence of nonexistence.
1.2.1.5. Con: Animals do value but only in relation to their survival/survival of the species. Selflessness \(sacrifice for a greater good\) is uniquely human.
1.2.1.6. Pro: Certain animals show clear evidence of valuing certain things, like mammals reacting poorly when separated from, or witnessing the suffering of their parents/children.
1.2.1.6.1. Pro: These reactions imply that animals value the presence and safety of their family.
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: Pets tend to show gratitude when kept comfortable and well-fed, implying that they value being given food and nurturing.
1.2.2. Con: Not all sentient humans are valuers, yet all sentient humans matter morally. So, one can matter morally without being a valuer.
1.2.3. Pro: Reflecting about this very subject - whether a human values more than an animal - is something only a human being can do.
1.2.4. Con: If value is a human construct, humans will naturally value themselves to the exclusion of others, even if that is not the correct judgement.
1.2.4.1. Con: If value is a human construct, then there cannot be a criterion that transcends humans, by which a value judgement can be said to be correct or incorrect.
1.2.5. Pro: It is our biological directive to preserve our own species at any cost.
1.2.5.1. Con: It is our biological directive to do whatever we feel is moral.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Natural does not equal moral. It is natural for an angry child to hit the person they are mad at, but we teach them not to do this. Just because we have survived that way til now does not mean we should continue to.
1.2.5.1.2. Pro: With Darwinism in mind, it makes sense to believe that our morals are selected traits. This is why we tend to act in ways that help out members of our species -- especially those in our family. However, if one's morals are wired to favor animal lives, it is his or her biological directive to do so.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: Individuals who mentally or morally deviate from the norm are often a detriment to society.
1.2.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: Some people are inclined to commit suicide, or to enjoy the pain of others. Individuals who favor animals over their own species may also have negative consequences for society.
1.2.5.1.2.1.2. Con: Individuals who mentally or morally deviate from the norm are often a benefit to society.
1.2.5.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: There are many famous examples of deviates that benefited society: [Nikola Tesla](https://www.livescience.com/46720-nikola-tesla-158th-anniversary.html), white abolitionists, Oskar Schindler of Schindler's list, [Ignaz Semmelweis](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/01/12/375663920/the-doctor-who-championed-hand-washing-and-saved-women-s-lives).
1.2.5.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Enjoying the pain of others provides an advantage to some societies. It can help in [war](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2396760/How-Comanche-Indians-butchered-babies-roasted-enemies-alive.html). It can help maintain power through [fear](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160401-how-did-evil-evolve-and-why-did-it-persist).
1.2.5.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Aggression in regards to war or self-defense is a normal and beneficial cognitive response. Purposely seeking out innocent and defenseless individuals, like children, for the sole purpose of torturing them is both detrimental and unnatural.
1.2.5.1.2.1.2.3. Con: While that may be true, it does not justify the permission of such attitudes in times when they are, in fact, detrimental.
1.2.5.1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: The beneficial behaviors of some people do not justify the detrimental behaviors of others. One goal of any society should be to allow the beneficial people to thrive, while weeding out the detrimental people who could undo the work done by the beneficial people.
1.2.5.1.2.1.2.3.1.1. Con: The "weeding out of detrimental people" often ends in genocide.
1.2.5.1.2.1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: In that case, anarchy is the only solution. All forms of government must deal with criminals and those who wish to do harm to innocents in some way or another.
1.2.5.1.2.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Some behaviors have no silver lining. There is never a one-size-fits-all solution. Some people are beyond repair, just as some bad dogs simply have to be put down.
1.2.5.2. Pro: There is a viewpoint that the natural world is ruled by evolution and 'survival of the fittest'. According to this viewpoint, if an animal life has not evolved to survive their environment, it is worth less, and should not be protected above more highly evolved animals \(e.g. humans\).
1.2.5.2.1. Con: The evolutionary 'survival of the fittest' makes no judgement on worth.
1.2.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.1.
1.2.5.2.3. Pro: Using evolutionary philosophy, the morals of how it 'should' be are fairly irrelevant. Those better at adapting survive, those worse at it die. It is not just about being better: For instance, dogs or pigs thrive as they adapted to being captives.
1.2.5.2.4. Con: We cannot be the only survivors on the planet as we are completely dependent on all other life forms on Earth. This is why we should honor animals as brothers and sisters, not as an object of economical profit.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Valuing ones species above others is how species survive.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.
1.2.5.3.2. Pro: Most species, including ours, have survived for ages thanks to that survival instinct: preserving one's own species prior to  others \(Thus valuing his own species above the others\). We should learn from them and follow that example.
1.2.5.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.
1.2.5.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.
1.2.5.3.2.3. Con: [Pigeons](https://corvidresearch.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/swift_marzluff_crows.pdf?utm_campaign=newsletter_84&utm_medium=email&amp) don't seem to notice if a person has killed a bird, even if that bird is a pigeon.
1.2.5.4. Pro: It is in our nature to try to preserve our own species as a priority, as our morality is directed by genetics/epigenetics/cultural architectures.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: Pragmatically, policies that do not prioritize human [deficiency needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) over the needs of animals are unlikely to garner sufficient support to be enacted, at least until most people’s deficiency needs are met.
1.2.5.5. Pro: [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes) told us in a natural state, [life](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/254050.html) would be nasty, brutal and short. Therefore we, as a species, need to subdue other species who could threaten us.
1.2.5.5.1. Con: Hobbes' "nasty, brutal and short" referred to life during war between humans. Using it as a reason to subdue other species makes no sense.
1.2.5.5.2. Con: Not all species are threatening to human existence and many are in fact vital to our well being. The utilization of animals to protect against the elements of starvation and inclement conditions is exerting dominance as opposed to an act of defense.
1.2.5.5.2.1. Pro: There are many animal species that contribute to the production of foods humans and other animals eat. Without them, these foods will die out.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1. Pro: There are many [animal species](https://www.thedodo.com/fellows-pitch-6-animals-the-wo-686089396.html), such as bees, that are vital to human life. It is important to preserve their lives if the human species is to survive at all. This shows that they may play a more valuable role, and therefore their lives should be valued above that of humans.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Humanity is able to replace many useful species with either human and mechanical labor or lab-developed alternatives.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Not all animal species are vital, including the bee.  In China, [human pollination](http://www.radiolab.org/story/how-important-bee__kw/) has opened up many labor jobs, and at times has proven to be more efficient than bee pollination.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Although it's currently efficient, it is [not sustainable](https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5193-Decline-of-bees-forces-China-s-apple-farmers-to-pollinate-by-hand) long-term. Farmers are forced to 'paint' pollen on every flower by hand which is proving to be tedious and more work than there are humans to complete it.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: As with most manual labor jobs, machines will eventually be developed to the point that they are able to replace both human and animal in this case, achieving greater speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.2. Pro: There is no way to test whether humans could exist without other species. Examples such as astronauts or laboratory settings are for a fixed time and supported by access to an ecosystem full of diverse species.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.2.1. Con: The majority of science is based on some kind of inference. We don't 'know' how mountains form or what the core of the Earth is made of. We don't even know if we exist. We must infer these things based on available evidence. Likewise, we may infer that we would be able to create the resources necessary to survive on our own, as any naturally occurring substance on Earth may be created artificially.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.3. Con: Most feasible initiatives to preserve bees are unlikely to threaten human life very directly. They may inconvenience humans, but opportunity cost does not have to translate into loss of life.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.3.1. Con: If time is money, and money is required to extend life \(through housing, healthcare, etc.\), opportunity cost does translate to loss of life \(mostly through length of time lived\).
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.4. Con: If bees are useful because they are vital to sustaining human life, that implies that they have less inherent worth, not more, than human life.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: One person might be sacrificed to save all bees, for instance, but only because those bees are vital for the rest of humans, not that bees are worth more than people.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.4.2. Con: There are many species of flora and animals that would also not exist if bees perished. Therefore, they are valuable to more than just humans and should be acknowledged as such.
1.2.5.5.2.1.1.5. Con: Any benefit humans get from saving animals is dependent upon humans being alive. Thus if we have to choose between saving an animal and a human we should save the human.
1.2.5.5.3. Con: This presumes any non mono-cellular life to be of serious threat to human life. This is obviously not the case. The technological gap between humans and even the most advanced animals eliminates this issue from relevant debate. Humans have sufficiently large a head-start to remain comfortably dominant.
1.2.5.5.3.1. Pro: Teeth and claws are of little effect against high-velocity projectiles and explosives. As soon as any animal species began to pose even a mild threat to humanity, it would be culled or eradicated with ease.
1.2.5.6. Con: Our biological directive is not enough to validate behavior. Our humanity takes into account moral and ethical responsibilities. Our 'natural inclination' should not be automatically considered a 'morally right' course of action.
1.2.5.6.1. Con: The extension of this would be that our biological directive does not justify the slaughter of animals for food.  While this may be true for some sections of the first world, vegetarianism is not a model that can sustain the human species worldwide.  If you are considering a new paradigm of human/nature interaction it would be built on the deaths of millions of people.  It would be immoral to trade their lives for an ideology at this point.
1.2.5.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.7.3.1.
1.2.5.6.2. Con: Morality and ethics exist for the purpose of survival, so they cannot supersede survival.
1.2.5.7. Pro: Given that humans are tribal animals who need each other to survive, it is reasonable to assert that we should place priority on our own kind.
1.2.5.7.1. Con: While it is true that we are tribal animals \(like so many others\), our ability to think and reason should instead enable us to make decisions that excede the base instincts of our own species' survival.
1.2.5.7.2. Pro: It is natural to prefer the survival of those you identify with. Human life should be valued above other life as one's family is valued above others' families.
1.2.5.7.2.1. Con: If a person considers their pet "a member of the family", this creates a moral quandry.
1.2.5.7.2.1.1. Pro: If it is true that a human naturally prefers one’s family over other humans;
And if it is also true that a human considers a pet as part of their family;
Then it would not be natural for the human to value non-family-humans more than family-pets.
1.2.5.7.2.2. Con: Abusive family members should not be valued over other humans.
1.2.5.7.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.
1.2.5.7.2.4. Pro: Even radical animal liberation fighters would call off an event if human life was in danger. This shows that they likely have a strong incentive to protect human life even at the expense of losing a battle.
1.2.5.7.2.5. Pro: It is only natural to preserve one's own kind first. In a fire, people would subconsciously rescue all the humans in the house before returning for pets.
1.2.5.7.3. Pro: Humans respecting other human lives have a better chance to have their own life respected. We cannot have the same understanding with other animals.
1.2.5.7.4. Con: There are many other animal species that need each other to survive. By this logic, priority could just as reasonably be placed on their kind.
1.2.5.7.4.1. Pro: [Elephants](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/photos/12-facts-change-way-see-elephants/elephants-need-their-elders), for example, need their elder matriarchs to pass vital knowledge down to younger members of the herd. Without this hierarchical system, younger generations would not survive.
1.2.5.8. Con: As established by geneticists and evolutionary biologists, our biological directive is to spread our own genes and reproduce. Other humans that aren't in one's own ancestry lower the chances of that particular gene line continuing on by competing for resources.  Meanwhile, a person can use animals to sustain them.
1.2.5.8.1. Con: The purpose of the reproduction instinct is to maintain a high population level. Humans already have a high population, and probably even too high. So we don't need to follow that instinct anymore.
1.2.5.8.2. Con: Other humans that aren't in your ancestry are required to mix your genes and maintain them strong. Without other humans we would practice incest, and incest leads to genetic malfunctions.
1.2.5.8.3. Con: If our directive is solely to reproduce, this implies that people who choose not to have children are somehow mentally or biologically defective. They are not.
1.2.5.8.4. Con: Other humans can enhance your gene line's survival chances by providing more mating opportunities.
1.2.5.8.5. Pro: We need to preserve other animal species in order to preserve our own.
1.2.5.8.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.5.2.1.1.
1.2.6. Pro: The human race cannot progress if time is wasted debating if other species should be valued above our own.
1.2.6.1. Con: Humans are considered to be a subspecies of the animal kingdom, so favouring humans could be [considered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism) to be irrationally favouring a specific animal.
1.2.6.2. Con: Progress won't be stopped for applying more ethical and empathetic behaviours to another species. Both can exist at the same time.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: Applying more empathy to cows, pigs, and chickens will result in lower production of meat. Taken to its implied conclusion, when food animals are treated with the same ethics and empathy as humans, there will be no more killing or eating of them whatsoever. With how much our world depends on meat to function, this could be catastrophic.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: Much of the world already depends on meat for sustenance. Should it ever become illegal \(or even morally unacceptable\) to eat meat, much of the human population will likely die of famine.
1.2.6.2.1.2. Pro: To attempt to reduce meat consumption, much time, money, and energy would need to be devoted to this task. Time, money, and energy that could be utilized to advance human technology and quality of life around the world instead.
1.2.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: This quality of life may also be applied to certain animals as well as humans. It comes at the cost of continuing to farm animals for meat, as that is what many popular carnivorous pets require to survive, like cats and dogs. These animals would also suffer as a result of reducing global meat consumption.
1.2.6.2.1.3. Pro: While good in principle, this could result in the slaughtering of millions of these animals, as there's likely to be challenges placing them elsewhere.
1.2.6.2.2. Pro: In the past, Black people were [considered animals](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-conversation-africa/comparing-black-people-to_b_9345322.html) with no rights. Including them as legal people was an improvement to the value of society, the same with the "animals" of today.
1.2.6.2.2.1. Con: Black people are still people. Their genetic information places them in the Homo Genus and Sapiens species. Animals are completely different genus from humans.
1.2.6.3. Pro: A discussion about valuing animal life over human life is laughable in a world where the majority of mankind is undervalued and oppressed by their own kind.
1.2.6.3.1. Con: "I shall have to express a very deep conviction: that until we have courage to recognize cruelty for what it is—whether its victim is human or animal—we cannot expect things to be much better in the world. There can be no double standard. We cannot have peace among men whose hearts find delight in killing any living creature. By every act that glorifies or even tolerates such moronic delight in killing, we set back the progress of humanity." ~ [by Rachel Carson​](https://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rachel_Carson)
1.2.7. Pro: From a utilitarian point of view, saving a human's life is a better option as an average human death impacts negatively a bigger number of entities.
1.2.8. Con: "Assessing value" is an inadequate description of the uniquely human capability. A better description would be that humans recognize moral responsibility.
1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.4. Con: Some human cultures and religions value animal lives above their own.
1.4.1. Con: Historical facts or religious beliefs do not necessarily represent a moral imperative or what "should" be the case.
1.4.1.1. Pro: [Vox Populi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_populi) assertions do not always reflect reality.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: The argument is a matter of value, not reality.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is no such thing as absolute value; the only value that exists is value given by some sort of agent. No animal is capable of providing value to things on a universal scale, only an immediate scale. Thus, to determine universal value, you may only consider the opinions of humans. If the majority of people follow a religion that places higher universal value on humans than animals, then, universally, humans must be of higher value than animals.
1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: But the original question is "should human life be valued above animal life?".
Even if the majority of people do currently value something, we can contend that they are wrong and they should not.
1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: When considering the value of humans versus the value of animals, the values placed on these groups by the majority is worth considering, as value is entirely subjective. It would be wrong to contend that their values are wrong, as values, much like opinions, cannot be wrong.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: People do not have complete knowledge of reality.
1.4.2. Pro: In India, the [cow](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170630-are-women-less-important-than-cows-in-india), considered sacred, is often protected more than women and girls.
1.4.3. Pro: Some schools of Buddhism recommend or require abstention from eating flesh.
1.4.4. Con: [Prevalent](http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm) religions [state](https://quran.com/31/20) that humans are directed to subdue and have dominion over the earth, including animals.
1.4.4.1. Pro: The Bible says that God gave humans dominion over the Earth. The environment exists to serve humanity's needs. [Genesis 1:28](http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm)
1.4.4.1.1. Con: “And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” \(Genesis 1:30\) This is clearly a statement in favour of vegetarianism.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: "Thou shalt not Kill" \([Exodus 20:13](https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/1/EXO.20.kjv)\) is unqualified and therefore should refer as equally to animals as it does to humans.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: “The righteous know the needs of their animals, but the mercy of the wicked is cruel.” \(Proverbs 12:10\) says that we should be compassionate towards animals. This is a far cry from killing them.
1.4.4.1.3.1. Con: As the main thesis isn't about general animal killing but about which life should be saved in a case that you have no option but having one killed, the argument that we should avoid cruelty is not suitable because there's no intention to kill.
1.4.4.1.4. Pro: Though man has a divine and sacred mandate to care for animals, the life of a man is more important than that of an animal in God's eyes.
1.4.4.1.4.1. Pro: Man was God's crowning achievement of Creation. [Genesis 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27&version=NKJV)
1.4.4.2. Pro: According to Buddhism, the Human Kingdom \(manushya\) is the first superior world of existence, and have the conditions to spiritual development. The previous 3 existences \(Animal Kingdom - tiryak, Hungry Spirits - pretas, Hell - naraka\) are very hard to progress.
1.4.4.3. Pro: From a Christian perspective, the Bible teaches that humans are the only creations made "[in the image of God](http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm)" giving them inherently more value than animals.  You can see similar themes in the way God relates to man compared to other [animals](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A26-34&version=NKJV).
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.3.
1.4.4.3.2. Con: According to [Hinduism](http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/essays/animals.asp), there is no spiritual difference between humans and other animals. A larger mass or more intelligent brain should not determine significance in the eyes of God.
1.4.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.4.
1.4.4.4. Con: Even in religions which advocate dominion [there is sufficient contradiction](https://freefromharm.org/veganism/christian-basis-veganism/), both in specific passages, and in an overall ethos of tolerance, grace, and mercy.
1.4.4.5. Con: Humans have the duty of wisely stewardship the Earth and its creatures. According to [Christian beliefs](https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zr3c7ty/revision/3) and also to the common practice of science, law and regulations.
1.4.4.6. Con: Not all religions specifically state humans have dominion over all subjects of the Earth and its land, with many advocating the contrary.
1.4.4.6.1. Pro: [Many religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_and_religion) encourage people to be vegetarian or vegan.
1.4.4.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.4.4.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.4.5. Con: Since the religions cited blur the distinction between a life and its sequel, their potential to inform general human morality on life or death choices is limited.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Many religions teach doctrines of [reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation), implying that death would not be permanent.
1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.6.1.
1.4.7. Pro: The Bible states that the earth, humans, and animals were created [at the same time](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%201.1%E2%80%935). They are all co-dependent.
1.4.7.1. Con: God made man responsible over Creation. Therefore, Creation is for man -- not man for creation. [Genesis 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2:15&version=NKJV)
1.4.7.1.1. Con: This passage of the Bible says "Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it". Notice the words "tend" and "keep". Responsibility doesn't mean privilege or power over something or somebody.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Animal rights philosopher Tom Regan [argues](http://regan.animalsvoice.com/animals-are-not-our-tasters/) that God has made humans "custodians" of His creation and so the way humans relate to animals should not be only determined by what they see as best for themselves.
1.4.7.3. Con: The Earth and humans were not created at the same time either in reality, or in the source you reference, as your reference has the Earth created on the second day and humanity on the fifth. [google.com](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=Genesis+1&version=CEB&interface=amp) [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life)
1.4.7.4. Con: Simultaneous creation does not cause co-dependence.
1.4.8. Con: Religion should not be conflated with morality.
1.4.8.1. Pro: In medicine and in so many other fields of study humans do not rely on religion as a main source of knowledge. For this reason, humans shouldn't do so in the case of animal rights.
1.4.8.1.1. Pro: When it comes to the study of animal rights, there are various scholarly works by renowned philosophers such as Tom Regan and Peter Singer who provide a solid and non-religious basis for respecting animals and their lives. Such works should not be ignored in favour of what religions have to say about animals and their rights.
1.4.8.2. Pro: Religious claims are a matter of faith, not fact. They do not provide evidence of anything.
1.4.8.2.1. Con: Codified religious writings often contain objectively useful directives that may have been based on evidence \('the right hand is the “clean” hand for shaking hands and eating with. The left hand is used for wiping yourself at the toilet'\). Therefore, it may be useful to examine the history, motivation, and efficacy of religious claims rather than dismissing them outright.
1.4.8.2.2. Con: The two religions noted in the parent account for [31.5%](https://www.google.com/search?q=percentage+of+the+world+that+is+christian&oq=percentage+of+the+world+that&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.6608j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of the world population and [24%](https://www.google.com/search?q=percentage+of+the+world+that+is+christian&oq=percentage+of+the+world+that&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.6608j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of the world population. The religious beliefs of over half the world's population deserve to be at least considered in this discussion.
1.4.8.2.2.1. Con: The arguments of religious people are considered but the opinion of a group is not an argument, nor are the settlements of the groups' holy books.
1.4.8.2.2.2. Con: The number of people believing in something doesn't make it correct. Even a large majority of people can be quite wrong.
1.4.8.2.3. Pro: Religions easily could contain bias in them towards valuing human life over animal life, especially considering that they are created and developed by humans. Since they are based on the beliefs of a human, not an animal, religions don't factually prove why humans should be valued over animals.
1.4.8.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.4.8.2.3.2. Con: Human values do not need to be proven valid, as they are inherently subjective. If you can subjectively claim that animals have more or equal value to humans, you can likewise claim that animals have less value than humans, which is the position held by the majority of the world's religions.
1.4.8.2.4. Con: All human values are matters of belief. Any claim that contains a moral imperative \("should"\) will be predicated on some unprovable value. Valuing human dominion over life is unempirical, but so is valuing animal life at all.
1.4.8.2.4.1. Pro: You cannot put an animal under a microscope and measure its value. Therefore, discarding all beliefs/value judgments would render this entire debate moot. A more fruitful counter would argue that other values are more important, relevant, etc.
1.4.8.3. Pro: Religion is full of dangerous statements.
1.4.8.3.1. Con: Dangerous statements are not inherently inaccurate.
1.4.8.3.2. Con: With the tremendous variety of religions on the earth, it is inaccurate to characterize religion as dangerous as a whole.
1.4.8.3.2.1. Con: The statement "Religion is full of dangerous statements" does not preclude other statements such as "religion is full of helpful statements".  It does not characterize religion as wholly dangerous.
1.4.8.4. Pro: Religion is a social construction, fostered by people. Therefore, it has no basis as a justifying force for people to value animal life or not.
1.4.8.5. Pro: Not all cases need be influenced by religion and therefore different cases may not have this rule factored in.
1.5. Con: This kind of value judgement cannot be generalized.
1.5.1. Pro: It should not be a general sentiment that is established. Each person should have their own ideas of worth.
1.5.1.1. Con: Worth and value is intrinsic to the individual item as given by a universal ethical and moral framework, not by one individual's perception of another.
1.5.2. Con: Objective moral truths exist and saving a human life over an animal's could be argued as such an objective moral truth. While there may be circumstantial differences the base value without further context would be true.
1.5.2.1. Con: Objective moral truth [doesn’t exist](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/opinion/sunday/how-firm-are-our-principles.html?_r=0).
1.5.2.1.1. Con: That is not what that source says, the source says that individuals are less likely to be ethically consistent. That does not refute the notion of "objective moral truth."
1.5.2.1.2. Con: The studies of [John Mikhail](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=954398) would refute the claims brought forth by the source. There may in fact be consistent frameworks that underly what "appears" to be inconsistent moralizing.
1.5.3. Pro: Values are a human invention and illusion - neither matters more than the other in the physical world.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Nothing contains intrinsic value as this would become transcendental and therefore conjecture. This makes value subjective and a personal construct that has no impact on the state of things. Any statement on one thing holding more value above another is therefore simply a game of persuasion, it is separate from what is objectively the case.
1.5.4. Pro: The statement is ill-posed without reference to the system of morality in question. For example, from a [nihilistic standpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism), neither human nor animal life should be valued above the other.
1.5.5. Pro: The value of both humans and animals is relative and cannot be simplified into absolute terms.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Whether human life or animal life should be preserved should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Too many factors play into certain situations of such that one definitive answer cannot be imposed.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: One example here could be the choice between saving the last of a \(non-human\) species and a human, in which case it might be more valuable to save a species rather than an individual.
1.5.5.1.1.1. Con: Saving the last individual \(or the last few individuals\) of a species will not save the species at all. A species needs a viable population to survive.
1.5.5.1.1.2. Con: While animal life could be more valuable than human in some special cases, there are few of those and they are not very likely. Thus, to discuss we could generalize since it doesn't really lessen the truth of the statement.
1.5.5.1.1.3. Con: This appeals to utilitarianism, in which case one must consider a human's potential. Even the most simplistic human individual could go on to functionally surpass a whole species of animals, such is the influence of humanity as Earth's dominant species.
1.5.5.1.1.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that one human would have the potential to do as much good as an entire species that has an important role in the ecosystem.
1.5.5.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The [re-introduction](https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem) of wolves into Yellowstone National Park caused a cascade effect on many other species, indicating life is interconnected.
1.5.5.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The ecosystem still existed without the wolves, it merely changed when they were reintroduced. This doesn't suggest anything about the importance of wolves. If biodiversity was that fundamental the world would end upon every extinction.
1.5.5.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Unlikely, but that doesn't mean it hasn't happened. One human has the potential to do much more good than any species on Earth as a whole, and it is this incredible potential unique to humans that makes us more valuable.
1.5.5.1.1.3.2. Con: Utilitarianism focuses on maximizing pleasure and reducing pain. The pleasure of many \(animals\) may outweigh the pain of one \(human\).
1.5.5.1.1.3.3. Con: Humans' ability to improve the world is matched by their ability to harm it.
1.5.5.1.1.4. Con: This may only be true about a very narrow selection of animal species, and even so, it is not an obvious choice because of the high capability of even one individual human. The vast majority of animal species don't provide such a crucial role that humans cannot fulfill themselves.
1.5.5.1.1.4.1. Con: The use of "crucial role" here is from a human perspective, not an objective one.
1.5.5.1.2. Con: Whereas many factors can be considered, they will always lead to the same conclusion: the human life is more valuable because of its potential and/or the moral meaning of such a consideration.
1.5.5.1.2.1. Con: Logic requires us to examine the extremes of possibilities before enacting a rule that may have unintended consequences. If there existed a choice between the life of a human mass murderer and the life of an animal, of which there was only one breeding pair, that was the source of a drug that could not be synthesized and was widely beneficial to humans, then we would be justified in choosing the animal to live. The exception negates the rule.
1.6. Pro: Humans have a moral duty to protect human lives over the lives of animals.
1.6.1. Con: Morality is defined by individuals, not the collective. What is moral for one may not be not moral for another. We cannot hold another person, let alone a non-human animal to a human moral standard.
1.6.1.1. Con: We can definitely hold another human to a human moral standard. This behaviour is prevalent in all social groups, and are called [social norms](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-norms/). In modern societies we have renamed the human moral standard to the societal acceptable actions, and we do hold people who act outside of this responsible. This is evident in the fact that all human societies have a form of legal system, and various ways of punishing those who don't conform to said system.
1.6.2. Con: If a feeling of “moral duty” isn't backed up by reason, it can be very misleading, or pure wrong.
1.6.2.1. Con: Morals are always representing the system that a given human is integrated in, and will always represent that humans best actions for short term survival, learned morals and values can represent long term solutions for the best outcome for the community. There are no objectively wrong morals.
1.6.3. Con: Morality should be assessed from an independent perspective, rather than an anthropocentric one.
1.6.3.1. Con: Assessing morality from independent perspective seems rather difficult or nearly impossible because there is very little information on what the animal's actual opinion on morals is, let alone the opinions of the plants, the planet or the universe. We simply do not and cannot know.
1.6.3.2. Con: Many if not most living beings are designed in such a way as to live at the expense of other living beings. Killing other living beings is thus to be considered an intrinsic feature of life itself. If any independent perspective exists, it is evident that from that perspective there would be no such thing as a right to life. Right to life is a human concept, and, as such, can only be assessed from an anthropocentric perspective.
1.6.4. Con: It is a human trait to preserve those with whom they hold emotional investment. This does not require the subject to be human.
1.6.4.1. Con: A human may hold an emotional investment even on an inanimate object, but this doesn't give him the right of valuing the integrity of such object above another human's life. Even a human he doesn't know.
1.6.5. Pro: Valuing human life over animal lives increases the chances a person will survive if in a life-threatening situation.
1.6.6. Pro: By the criteria which prioritizes the betterment of the species, humans should be preserved.
1.6.6.1. Con: The betterment of our species is a [sollipsistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism) argument that misses the more fundamental assertion being made: it rests on the assumption that betterment of the human species is inherently more important than betterment of another species. If we reject, or challenge this assumption, the argument falls down.
1.6.6.2. Pro: If humans are concerned, preferring human life over the other is a reasonable conclusion in most cases. The perspective is important.
1.6.7. Pro: Prioritizing human lives over animals is the response that human dignity requires. Sometimes, doing anything else would be unconscionable. For example, if food were scarce, we shouldn't choose to feed pets instead of children.
1.6.8. Con: Humans do not have any moral obligations to other animals.
1.6.8.1. Con: Morality stems from [survival](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/am-i-right/201204/society-doesnt-create-morality-and-neither-do-individuals), so humans have moral obligations to animals that assist in the survival of the human species.
1.6.8.2. Con: Humans have a moral imperative to respect the lives of animals and to reduce their suffering.
1.6.8.2.1. Con: Devaluing human life over animal life would leave a moral vacuum in which neither humans nor animals would be reliably protected.
1.6.8.2.1.1. Pro: Humanity is growing out of selfishness, learning to empathise beyond the level of the tribe.
1.6.8.2.1.2. Pro: Out-group cruelty that was acceptable 50 years ago is not today.
1.6.8.3. Con: In the same sense, we have no moral obligations towards each other, or anything, for that matter. If we decide it's wrong to cause a certain experience, a certain amount of suffering, or prevent a creature from doing what its will says, it's hypocritical to flip-flop about it, merely based on genetic similarity to us.
1.6.9. Pro: The human right to life is mutual agreement - it comes with a responsibility to preserve other humans' right to life since animals are not capable of respecting the right to life.
1.6.9.1. Con: The right-to-life could be extended toward animals: that humans not kill an animal unless that animal has attempted to kill a human.
1.6.9.2. Con: Humans extend right-to-life to other humans who are mentally incapable of themselves respecting right-to-life: someone in a coma, someone who takes a guilt-by-insanity plea, someone with severe mental retardation.
1.6.9.3. Con: Animals do respect the right to life. They probably learn it the same way we learn it as children. We do not need codified contracts. It's just the way we do it. Laws and agreements only normalize what's given.
1.6.9.3.1. Pro: There are many examples: domesticated or tamed predators \(dogs, cats, ...\) can coexist and even care for animals who would normally be their prey \(chicken, mice...\) There was a story of [a bear saving a crow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=TSPgenqMlvQ) - not for food. Dolphins saving drowning humans and so on... Dogs don't usually, most of the time, eat their owner's children either.
1.6.9.4. Con: Humans have come up with some very sophisticated and deliberate ways to disrespect the right to life and to wipe out members of their own species en mass. That's something animals are certainly not capable of!
1.6.9.4.1. Pro: Humans have demonstrated their gross disrespect for the right to life on way too many occasions. For example in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_of_indigenous_peoples#Colonialism_and_genocide_in_the_Americas), [Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide), [Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_China)...
1.6.9.5. Con: Non-human animals are not moral agents and cannot be kept to human moral standards.
1.6.9.6. Pro: Human morality is constructed/developed by and for humans. While it's true that animals cannot be judged against a human moral standard, it's equally true that there is no inherent reason why animal life should be protected under a human moral code.
1.6.9.6.1. Con: It is not necessarily true that there is no inherent reason why animal life should be protected under a human moral code.
1.6.9.6.1.1. Pro: Even if animals are considered 'lower' on the human moral code, humans can still protect animals through morals that value life/ecology.
1.6.9.6.2. Con: Our legal code contains laws against animal abuse.
1.6.9.7. Pro: If the dog wants to kill the deer, for example, it kills the deer. If we respect all animals' right to life, we would have to prevent animals from killing each other. Since this is not possible, we must protect ourselves first.
1.6.9.8. Pro: In order to build a civilized society, humans must create some form of social contract with each other. As much as we may value animal life, it is not feasible to create a social contract with animals. As such, there is no basis for equal dignity between humans and animals.
1.6.9.8.1. Con: Equal dignity is not the same as right-to-life.
1.6.10. Con: Animals cannot opt out or into dangerous situations, so it is a human's responsibility to give animals freedom from pain and anguish where they cannot themselves.
1.6.10.1. Con: Agreed, but not at the ultimate expense of another human being. Humans have a legal duty to preserve human life. If there is no legal precedent to this effect, there will be one after the first test case in a court of law. That is, saving an animal's life in lieu of a human life will have legal ramifications. Yet the converse is not true.
1.6.10.1.1. Con: While law creates a difference between the legal rights of non-human-animals and the legal rights of humans, this does not mean there is an actual, inherent difference.
1.6.10.1.1.1. Con: Law acknowledges a difference only because science proves that there is, in fact, an inherent difference.
1.6.10.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.2.
1.6.10.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.2.
1.6.10.2. Con: Animals are able to distinguish between threats and non-threats. It is not a human's duty to liberate animals.
1.6.10.3. Pro: We choose to have our pets undergo life-saving surgeries. We allow humans to choose not to have life-saving surgeries.
1.7. Con: All life should be valued equally.
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.
1.7.2. Pro: All life is made of the same [star stuff](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/144310-the-nitrogen-in-our-dna-the-calcium-in-our-teeth) and exhibits the same will to live and to hold together. Therefore, all life is sacred.
1.7.2.1. Pro: That also applies to plants and insects and viruses. The life of planets and the universe. Life of one specimen or one species cannot be taken out of context.
1.7.2.2. Pro: While killing is part of life, we can use resources in gratitude and full awareness of the miracle of life and eliminate unnecessary suffering. That is where all life is equally valuable.
1.7.2.3. Pro: Being aware of their similarity to other living beings, humans may value that similarity, as a reflection or even an extension of self, in animals.
1.7.3. Con: If animals like insects are equal to humans, then humans kill too many things and should die. Such an idea ought not to be supported.
1.7.4. Pro: Species is not a relevant trait when it comes to assessing the value of an animal's life.
1.7.4.1. Con: Species is one of the most important traits to determine how tragic a death is. An elephant's death is always more tragic than the death of a mosquito, because elephants have very strong social relationships and suffer greatly when they lose a loved one. The death of a mosquito has much less impact on others. If one death is more tragic than the other, then one life is also more valuable than the other.
1.7.4.2. Con: Species is relevant in the context of [anthropocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocentrism). Humans necessarily must value our own species over other animals to justify our very existence, let alone building our environment and sustaining ourselves with plant and non-human animal resources.
1.7.4.2.1. Con: Anthropocentrism is cultural, therefore not necessary, and must be morally examine.
1.7.4.2.2. Con: The existence of human life has not been decided by any human. Therefore its existence doesn't need any justification, only an explanation \(where do we come from?\). However its preservation needs one, and one cannot justifie the preservation of human life by the only fact that it exists.
1.7.4.3. Pro: Humans are prone to way more cruelty than animals. So, the contribution to the quality of life as a whole by a species should be taken into consideration over the value of the species.
1.7.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.
1.7.4.3.2. Pro: Because humans have more ability to control their own environment and the environment of other animals, it is statistically more likely that humans have committed more acts of cruelty than other animals. Animals have less ability to be cruel.
1.7.4.3.3. Pro: One could argue that cruelty, i.e. intentionally causing harm for no other advantage than a rush of endorphins as one enjoys the malicious outcome, is a trait only exhibited by humans as we are self-aware.
1.7.4.3.4. Pro: Speciesism is another example of human intolerance and discrimination that slides down a slippery-slope towards disrespect, apartheid, genocide, and ends with ecosystem collapse. The value of animal life in relation to a species within an ecosystem should be synonymous with the utility of a healthy ecosystem; the two are not mutually exclusive.
1.7.4.3.4.1. Con: The problem with the concept of ‘speciesism’ is the fact that humans can be objectively demonstrated to be, overall, superior to animals. In which case, valuing humans over animals is not immoral—it’s purely logical.
1.7.4.3.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.7.4.3.4.2. Pro: There is no metric that is not discriminatory to be able to say one life matters more than another.
1.7.4.3.4.2.1. Con: It's not clear how discrimination, in this case, is a bad thing.
1.7.4.3.4.3. Con: We can value humans as having a much higher potential to affect the world than a single animal, and choose a human life above an animals without the darker side of humanity coming out. One does not have to be a puppy-kicker to value human life over an animal's.
1.7.4.3.4.4. Con: Disrespect, apartheid, genocide and ecosystem collapse are much more about apathy and a lack of caring. Valuing a human life above an animal's is not straddling that line.
1.7.4.4. Con: Many highly relevant characteristics are implied in species: Mass, volume, sense capabilities, brain size and function, metabolic needs, and ecological function. All cows produce more milk than mosquitos. All humans have more complex \(and more conscious\) emotional and cognitive lives than other mammals.
1.7.4.4.1. Pro: A trivial example would be the value of an ant, which belongs to the animal kingdom, versus the value of a dolphin.
1.7.4.4.1.1. Con: The usefulness-value/superiority of an adaptation depends upon one's situation/environment.
1.7.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: If a significant gamma-ray burst would strip off parts of the atmosphere, tardigrades would survive, [while](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/07/14/these-animals-can-survive-until-the-end-of-the-earth-astrophysicists-say/?utm_term=.76aae55acd4f) humans would not.
1.7.4.4.1.1.1.1. Con: We have developed technology that would allow us to survive such an event. Our technology could allow us to survive more than any other species on Earth.
1.7.4.4.2. Con: Not "all" humans have more complex and conscious emotional and cognitive lives compared to "all" mammals. For example, some say that pigs are [as smart](https://modernfarmer.com/2014/03/pigheaded-smart-swine/) as 3 years old humans \(which would make even younger humans less smart than pigs\).
1.7.4.4.2.1. Con: Nonetheless, a fully developed pig cannot ever develop their intelligence beyond that of a 3 year old and never has agency.
1.7.4.4.2.1.1. Con: This means that a human with no agency and no chance of developing further \(for example, someone in a [permanent vegetative state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_vegetative_state)\) should be valued less than a pig.
1.7.4.4.2.1.2. Pro: A 3 year old human, being in the early stages of its life, has the latent potential to increase their intelligence and will develop agency as they mature giving way to a much more complex cognitive life than that of a pig.
1.7.4.4.3. Con: Cognitive ability and level of consciousness does not signify importance or superiority over others. Disabled people have as much right to live a life free of suffering as abled-bodied people.
1.7.4.4.3.1. Con: Life is valuable insofar as the organism that is the subject of that life is aware of its own existence and values its life. An organism with more awareness and cognitive capacity can value its life more than an organism with lesser capacity. Thus, the life of an anencephalic child or a human in a vegetative state matters less than a nonhuman animal with greater consciousness.
1.7.4.5. Con: The predator-prey hierarchy is the ultimate deciding factor to what life should be valued, thus species is a relevant trait to natural order.
1.7.4.5.1. Con: Predator-prey hierarchy is a poor measure of value.
1.7.4.5.1.1. Pro: Species die and have died for millennia. It is a natural course of a species and does not mean that species should be valued more than another.
1.7.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: Many would argue that by being to blame for an accelerated rate of extinction of many species, humans should endeavour to value animal life more, however not necessarily more than humans.
1.7.4.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.1.3.
1.7.4.5.1.3. Pro: Prey animals species often feed multiple predator species. Therefore, the loss of a prey species potentially effects more species than the loss of a predator species. The sheer number of beings effected would imply a greater impact/value of the prey species' life.
1.7.4.5.2. Con: A 'might-is-right' ranking of species' value according to the predator-prey relationship is not tenable. For example, if a species of great ape became more intelligent than humans and chose to kill them en masse, this would not be a morally justifiable action on their part.
1.7.4.5.3. Pro: Humans \(with our tools\) are currently the apex predator on the planet.  Therefore, a person may value the life of deer, but place greater value on feeding their family.
1.7.4.6. Con: Putting all species at the same level \(including human\), would mean that if a puppy and a 2 years old kid are drowning both would have the same right to be saved by a human.
1.7.4.7. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.2.
1.7.4.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.
1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.
1.7.6. Pro: Some cultures ascribe to [animism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism), which suggests that the world was once known to host a wide array of creatures in no form of hierarchy.
1.7.6.1. Con: While animism was, and is, believed throughout the world in general the public does not tend to ascribe the same rights to animals as humans \(greater than [60%](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/americans-animals-human-rights-poll) did not in a US survey\).
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: This is further supported by the fact that the vast [majority](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/americans-animals-human-rights-poll) of people still use animal products and eat meat.
1.7.7. Pro: Humans are no different than animals.
1.7.7.1. Con: Without the perceived barrier between humans and other animals, we would have no moral barrier to treating humans like we do animals, which would result in negative social consequences.
1.7.7.2. Con: We Humans have a literal distinction in words. We call one group Human and the other Animals. Based on context, Humans may be Animals but there is a distinction.
1.7.7.3. Pro: Humans are animals.
1.7.7.3.1. Pro: Humans belong to the biological kingdom Animalia.
1.7.7.3.2. Pro: All living organisms that feed on organic matter are animals. All humans are living organisms that feed on organic matter. Therefore, all humans are animals.
1.7.7.3.2.1. Con: Not only animals feed on organic matter. There are fungi, these either decompose dead organic matter or parasite on plants or animals. There are plants that parasite on other plants. And ultimately, fertilizer is also organic matter and plants consume it when growing.
1.7.7.4. Con: If humans were no different to animals, our only values would be strictly to survive and live by our natural instincts.
1.7.7.4.1. Con: Humans started out with the same basic survival instincts and value of survival as all other animals, but as humans and society evolved, their values evolved to include other, more complex, values.
1.7.7.5. Pro: Both humans and animals have the same right to be here as both lives are worth the same.
1.7.7.5.1. Con: A right to be something is subjective.
1.7.7.5.2. Con: A brain surgeon's value is far greater than that of a rat, due to the impact of their contributions on the world.
1.7.7.5.2.1. Con: Such value is subjective: A brain surgeon is valuable if one needs brain surgery. In a different situation, a camel may be more suited to saving somebody's life.
1.7.7.5.2.2. Con: This argument implies only to seldom and specific examples that do not represent humans as a whole.
1.7.7.6. Con: If humans are no different than animals then one would expect a human to value human life over an  animal's life, just as many animal species do.
1.7.7.6.1. Pro: The adult water buffalo would instinctively [protect young water buffalo](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-2891176/Moment-brave-buffalo-takes-THREE-hungry-lions-rescue-young-calf-snatched-herd.html) at the expense of the starving lion cub. If humans are no different, than they too would protect their own before that of another species.
1.7.7.7. Pro: There is no moral distinct boundary between humans and animals in evolutionary terms. The subjective experience of a human is not necessarily more valuable than that of an animal.
1.7.7.7.1. Con: There is no distinct boundary between humans and animals and rocks and burning balls of gas in atomic terms.  Differences between objects are more salient than similarities for the purpose of this discussion.
1.7.7.7.2. Con: Evolutionary terms are not the only, or most important, terms by which to classify things.
1.7.7.8. Con: There are several emotional, psychological, physical, energetic, and behavioral differences between humans and animals that distinguish the two.
1.7.7.8.1. Pro: Humans have loved ones, and fear. If you kill a human you make their relatives sad, or make other people scared that they will be killed in similar circumstances. So often killing humans is worse, even if you don't value humans above animals intrinsically.
1.7.7.8.1.1. Con: Animals also express [fear](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1559976/) and [grief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_grief).
1.7.7.8.2. Con: Some animals are more sentient than some humans.
1.7.7.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.7.7.8.2.2. Con: Some animals being more sentient than some humans is not a reason to value them above humans. Some humans are more sentient than some animals. Thus, this is more an argument for equal value of both.
1.7.7.8.2.3. Con: Sentience and awareness of your surroundings are arguably different concepts, and humans already practice euthanasia in circumstances where the quality of life is called into question: what difference is there between euthanasia and the death of animals that are less sentient than us?
1.7.7.8.2.4. Pro: Humans in vegetative states cannot suffer.
1.7.7.8.2.5. Con: Such cases are rare, as are cases where the decision needs to made to preserve either one individual animal or one individual human. The likelihood that we need to either save the life of an animal OR preserve a vegetative human is so small as to be practically irrelevant.
1.7.7.8.2.5.1. Con: Whereas such a situation is unlikely at the individual level, the healthcare cost of vegetative individuals could be considered to be better used for animal rights or care at the governmental level.
1.7.7.8.2.5.1.1. Con: It could be further argued that these costs are better appropriated to saving the lives of conscious humans by increasing healthcare resources in impoverished areas.
1.7.7.8.2.6. Con: There are no animals capable of fighting for their own rights. Therefore, human populations have a self-sentience/ self-awareness of their rights that no animal ever had.
1.7.7.8.2.7. Con: Most humans have far superior capabilities than most non-human animals.
1.7.7.8.3. Con: These differences are all subjectively experienced by humans, and it is not clear that there are meaningful, objective differences in an animal's experience compared to a human's experience.
1.7.7.8.3.1. Con: Humans have complex language describing non-physical constructs.
1.7.7.8.3.1.1. Con: Without being able to understand non-human languages, we have no way of knowing non-human animals lack this ability.
1.7.7.8.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Dolphins](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/dolphins-speak-language-human-communication-scientists-a7237791.html), for example, have a language construct similar in intelligence to humans, however it is beyond the time and frequency of hearing available to humans.
1.7.7.8.3.2. Pro: Many animal species are capable of sensing the world in ways that humans cannot intrinsically do, such as [mantis shrimp](https://www.livescience.com/42797-mantis-shrimp-sees-color.html) being able to see in more wavelengths of light, which may generate a richer life experience for those animals than humans could enjoy.
1.7.7.8.4. Pro: Genetically, humans have common traits to some animals, especially apes. But animals are unable to do the vast majority of things humans are able to do.
1.7.7.8.5. Pro: Humans have much higher cognitive faculties than are thought to exist in any other animal.
1.7.7.8.6. Pro: Humans' abilities to comprehend the future may suggest we can suffer more.
1.7.7.8.6.1. Con: While they might experience it differently, animals such as dogs, for example, have an [understanding of time](http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/can-dogs-understand-time/) and can anticipate events.
1.7.7.8.7. Pro: Humans have souls.
1.7.7.8.7.1. Con: According to the [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephesh) interpretation of 'soul' or 'breath of life' \(nephesh\), animals also have souls.
1.7.7.8.7.1.1. Con: However, this is an extension of an equally unverified assumption of the religious concept of a soul.
1.7.7.8.7.2. Con: There is no scientific evidence for the existence or presence of souls, and no measurable practical effects of souls.
1.7.7.8.7.3. Pro: In most religions/spiritual systems, humans are the only creatures which possess souls \(which are distinct from consciousnesses\), which gives each person an eternal nature- making each person intrinsically valuable.
1.7.7.8.7.3.1. Con: Something eternal is not necessarily more valuable than something non-eternal.
1.7.7.8.7.3.2. Con: There is no scientific evidence of this being actually true however, other than faith. While we should respect faith, it shouldn't be the rule by which we ever judge life as this has caused as much fury, war and injustice as religion has attempted to promote in the opposite.
1.7.7.9. Con: If this is true, pet ownership is slavery, meat is murder, and scientific testing on mice is the moral equivalent to Imperial Japanese and Nazi human experimentation.
1.7.7.9.1. Pro: Many vegan and vegetarian activists argue that industrial meat production is murder.
1.7.7.9.2. Pro: Some animal rights activists consider domesticated pets to be slaves to humans.
1.7.7.9.2.1. Pro: Two law professors from Rutgers University [argued](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/22/rutgers-law-professors-say-pets-are-animal-slaves-/) in an essay that pets are "animal slaves".
1.7.7.9.2.2. Pro: PETA [advocate](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/why-peta/pets/) not having pets.
1.7.7.9.2.3. Con: Dogs are not "slaves" to humans. Dogs most likely became domesticated in the first place because they were smart enough to realize that humans could protect them from the harsh wilderness. Dogs made a "deal" with humans: we feed them and care for them, they help us protect our shelters and herd farm animals. In this way, dogs are an asset.
1.7.7.9.2.3.1. Con: In many contexts, this is what slavery actually is. Slaves are provided for and sheltered in return for their usefulness, but ultimately the owner doesn't have any / many obligations towards them.
1.7.7.9.3. Con: -> See 1.6.10.1.1.
1.7.7.9.4. Con: The way in which many pets are treated is vastly different to the treatment of slaves.
1.7.8. Con: -> See 1.2.5.2.
1.7.9. Con: Unlike humans, other animals don't have [long-term](https://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/dogs-perceive-time2.htm) hopes, plans, and dreams they wish to achieve, so we should value survival of humans over survival of non-human animals.
1.7.9.1. Pro: A human will take another human's choice into consideration. An animal will not have this same sort of awareness.
1.7.9.2. Con: Personal hopes and dreams have no objective or inherent value.
1.7.9.2.1. Con: Hopes and dreams cause people to take action towards those hopes and dreams. They are the fundamental seeds from which virtually all human advancement has grown.
1.7.9.2.2. Con: Personal hopes and dreams are where "values" originate. There's no such thing as objective or inherent value.
1.7.9.3. Con: There are young, injured, and/or depressed humans who have no plans, hopes, or dreams.
1.7.10. Con: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.
1.7.11. Con: Some animals are endangered, and these should be valued over humans, who are not endangered.
1.7.11.1. Con: -> See 1.7.4.5.1.1.
1.7.11.2. Con: Humans play a key role in preserving some endangered species.
1.7.11.2.1. Con: This only means that humans undertaking species-preserving research should be saved in preference to members of endangered species, not in preference to most humans.
1.7.11.2.2. Con: Humans are a [cause](http://science.jrank.org/pages/2467/Endangered-Species.html) of animals being endangered. Without them, fewer animals would become extinct and species will evolve naturally.
1.7.11.2.2.1. Pro: Human populations grow far too rapidly and use way too much land and resources and as a result, many species are either already extinct, or on the verge of extinction.
1.7.11.2.2.1.1. Con: Far more species have been made extinct by nature than will ever be made extinct by human activity.
1.7.11.2.2.2. Con: Almost all life forms that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct. Extinction is not necessarily a bad thing - it makes way for new life to emerge.
1.7.11.2.3. Pro: Without human-created [genetic](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/26/biologists-genetic-modification-endangered-species) intervention technologies, many endangered species would now be extinct.
1.7.11.2.4. Pro: Humans have made valiant efforts in creating and preserving habitats for endangered species.
1.7.11.2.5. Pro: Humans are doing research to learn more about endangered species and what is necessary for them to thrive without permanent human intervention.
1.7.11.3. Pro: An example: [Poachers may lawfully get shot by rangers](https://www.savetherhino.org/thorny-issues/shoot-to-kill/) on duty if they fight back and resist arrest. Other examples could follow where such conduct, though illegal, would be considered by the actors as their moral duty.
1.7.11.3.1. Con: Any law enforcement official may shoot anyone who fights back or resists arrest. This is an act of self-defense, not valuing animals above humans.
1.7.11.4. Con: Valuing a species simply based on number is irrational. We humans have more impact on the earth than any other, and we number far less than some insect species, which can't compare to our effect.
1.7.11.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.7.11.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.12.4.2.
1.7.11.5. Pro: The chance of human extinction is much lower than the chance of endangered species' extinction.
1.7.11.5.1. Con: We are not immortal and are as much at risk of extinction as any other life form on the planet. Our importance then becomes subsequently moot.
1.7.11.5.1.1. Con: Humans are not at as much risk of extinction as every other species. It is true that humans can be wiped out by a mass extinction event \(like Earth being hit by a comet\) just as well as any other species. And yes, all species eventually die/evolve away. However, under non-catastrophic circumstances, it is statistically much more likely that [the last 2 northern white rhinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_white_rhinoceros) will all die tomorrow than it is that all 7 billion humans will all die tomorrow.
1.7.11.5.2. Pro: There are around eight billion humans alive on Earth and over [16,300](http://www.endangeredearth.com/) endangered animal species.
1.7.11.6. Con: Preserving the maximum number of species is not necessarily good.
1.7.11.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.5.1.1.
1.7.11.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.
1.7.11.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.1.1.
1.7.12. Pro: All life has value, meaning and purpose no matter what sort of life it is.
1.7.12.1. Pro: All life \(animal and plant\) has equal value where life is concerned. They are connected, even if one depends on the other to survive: the wolf to the cow, for example, or the cow to the grass. It does not diminish the value of life. All life is interconnected, even humans.
1.7.12.1.1. Pro: Intensive farming in the United States created a [desert](https://www.history.com/topics/dust-bowl) in the Midwest and Southern Great Plains.
1.7.12.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.1.1.3.1.1.
1.7.12.1.3. Con: Humans have a stronger connection to one-another than animals.
1.7.12.1.3.1. Pro: If a dog in Nigeria is sick, for example, other dogs around the world do not care or respond. Humans are more likely to feel sympathy towards other humans who are suffering and try to help.
1.7.12.1.3.1.1. Con: Dogs around the world would not care or respond because they are not aware of the existence of the hypothetical sick dog in Nigeria. Any given reader is at present unaware of a single individual somewhere who is suffering, and because of this ignorance cannot even choose to care or respond because they are not aware that this individual exists or how it is that they suffer. By the above logic, those hypothetical readers are somehow being callous or inhuman.
1.7.12.1.3.1.2. Con: By this logic, human beings must be valuable proportionate to their empathy. Ergo, sociopaths or other individuals with limited empathy are less valuable human beings.
1.7.12.1.4. Con: Humans have a stronger connection to animals than animals have to one-another.
1.7.12.1.4.1. Con: There is no way to measure the relative "strength" of connections between animals vs. the "strength" of connections between humans and animals.
1.7.12.1.4.2. Con: Many animals are capable of forming strong bonds with one another; [cows, for instance.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/07/cows-best-friends)
1.7.12.1.4.3. Con: How we conceive of "strong" connections is biased towards the ways in which humans specifically form connections. No animal connections will be perfectly analogous to human ones, but neither will they be to one another -- they're different animals.
1.7.12.2. Con: "Value", "Meaning" and "Purpose" are all human concepts. Life simply lives, reproduces, adapts and dies.
1.7.12.2.1. Pro: Because these concepts are human, they only work in a human society. So, naturally, humans assign greater value, meaning and purpose to their own lives, than they would to other animals' lives.
1.7.12.2.1.1. Pro: The value humans place on their own lives reflects basic survival instincts - if any species stopped valuing their own species more then any other, they would go extinct.
1.7.12.2.2. Pro: "Value", "Meaning" and "Purpose" sound positive and heart-felt, but don't really mean anything; they're abstract and vague.
1.7.12.3. Con: Some life solely has the purpose of sustaining itself, and doing that only causes harm to other life forms, e.g. most parasites. It is hard to perceive these as valuable.
1.7.12.3.1. Pro: Mosquitoes have little ecological value, yet kill millions with the diseases they carry.
1.7.12.3.1.1. Con: Mosquito larvae are useful as food for fish and tadpoles, as well as some species of insect and birds.
1.7.12.3.1.2. Pro: Some protozoa species are parasites. [Malaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria) and [sleeping sickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_trypanosomiasis) are caused by these, with insects like mosquitoes or flies being just a vector. The value of such life is questionable at best.
1.7.12.4. Con: The value, meaning, and purpose of humans is greater than that of animals. Even though all life has some level of value, humans being the most valuable provides the best and most fundamental reason why a human life should be prioritized over an animal life in the event that only one may be preserved.
1.7.12.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.1.2.2.1.1.
1.7.12.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.8. Con: Animals can survive without humans, whereas humans require animals to survive.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.5.2.1.1.
1.8.2. Con: Humans rely on animals and plants to survive, but it does not follow from this we must value animal life above of that of humans in order to survive.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Plants can survive without animals, whereas animals require plants to survive. If the argument above is valid, we should equally infer that plant life should be valued above animal life.
1.8.3. Con: This is true for all [apex predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_predator). This is not specific to humankind.
1.8.3.1. Pro: If great white sharks perish, other animals will go on without them, but they require seals and other sea-life to flourish.
1.8.3.2. Pro: All life is interdependent, thus the disappearance of a species will always have ecological effects. We cannot use this criteria to exalt or condemn humans.
1.8.3.2.1. Pro: Human life has intrinsic interdependence with many ecological functions, thus cannot be valued over other life absolutely.
1.8.4. Pro: Life on Earth would be just fine without humans. Evidence is apparent as we have only influenced a tiny [fraction of Earth's history](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/08/putting-time-in-perspective.html).
1.8.4.1. Con: In the case of a global disaster where [no life could survive whatsoever](https://www.businessinsider.com/sun-destroy-earth-red-giant-white-dwarf-2016-9), only humans would have the technology to preserve any life at all.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: Just like Noah's Ark, humans are capable of preserving life if need be. We have already visited Mars as a potential place to do so.
1.8.4.1.2. Con: In one billion years, there could be a few civilizations of non-human life forms to develop much more sophisticated technology.
1.8.4.1.2.1. Con: If a global cataclysmic event wipes out all life, there never will be another intelligent species on Earth. The chances are quite likely a cataclysmic event will happen long before that.
1.8.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: Given we don’t know how life started in the first place, we can’t say for sure it’d ever happen again.
1.8.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.5.
1.8.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: Even if life does manage to reappear on Earth, it’s probably safe to assume the sun will sterilize the planet before it becomes highly intelligent advanced life capable of colonizing other planets.
1.8.4.1.2.1.3. Pro: Depending on the type of cataclysm, it could leave earth uninhabitable, such as by altering or destroying the atmosphere.
1.8.4.1.3. Con: Spreading life to other planets would require simpler life forms, such as bacteria, single cell organisms, fungi, algae... more importantly than a human crew.
1.8.4.1.3.1. Con: With no means to survive outside or even travel outside our Earth, simple life forms are less important than the one species that can make all that happen.
1.8.4.1.3.2. Pro: If a spaceship should travel for thousands or millions of years and resources ran out for humans to survive except for consuming the simpler life forms, it would make more sense to let the simpler life forms reach the destination with the support of robots and artificial intelligence and for the humans to let go of their lives for the benefit of life starting somewhere else.
1.8.4.1.4. Pro: Without human activity, a global cataclysmic event may well be the end of all life in the universe, if there truly is nothing beyond Earth. Until that point, humanity should be favored above all other life as being the only species with the potential to preserve life in the case of such an event.
1.8.4.2. Pro: For preservation of life in case of a global disaster, simpler life forms are much more likely to adapt to new conditions. That is apparent from the [great dying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event), or [the dinos extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event) or the beginning of life on Earth itself.
1.8.5. Pro: Domination through control of resources only highlights our dependence upon those resources. Mismanagement through de-valuing resources \(such as animals\) is a danger.
1.8.5.1. Con: All forms of life depend on resources. It is the uniquely human ability to have total control of said resources that makes us superior.
1.8.6. Con: Humans have domesticated many animals to the point that they would be unfit to survive in the event of human extinction. As they rely on humans for survival, it is logical to not value their lives above human lives.
1.8.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.3.
1.8.6.2. Con: There are many domesticated animals, such as dogs and cats, that can revert to a feral state if left to survive in the wild.
1.8.6.2.1. Pro: Hawai'i is populated by [feral chickens](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/science/in-hawaii-chickens-gone-wild.html) that live in the wild.
1.8.6.2.2. Pro: [Feral pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_pig), which are descended from domesticated pigs, live all over the world.
1.8.6.2.3. Pro: Wild cattle live in different parts of the world. In [Hawai'i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_wild_cattle), descendants of cattle given as a present by a British officer still roam freely.
1.8.6.3. Pro: Furthermore, all animals, wild or domestic, depend on some other species for survival. Only humans are capable of surviving without depending upon any other species.
1.8.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.1.
1.8.6.3.2. Pro: We could [artificially create any substance](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/37708/can-all-compounds-that-plants-and-animals-produce-be-synthesized-in-a-lab) we would normally depend on animals for, becoming completely self-sufficient. No animal can do this.
1.8.6.3.2.1. Con: Nature does this [more efficiently](https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/37708/can-all-compounds-that-plants-and-animals-produce-be-synthesized-in-a-lab) than man can.
1.8.6.3.2.1.1. Con: Human technology advances much faster than biological systems do. Humans will eventually surpass nature in this regard.
1.8.7. Con: All life on the planet as it currently exists has evolved to depend on other life. All living organisms - human or non-human - require other organisms for food, to fertilize their food, to spread seeds, etc.
1.8.8. Con: Many species have already adapted to the presence of humans, as all species are interlinked. As such the death of humans would threaten them.
1.8.8.1. Pro: Without humans, cities would decay, which would cost numerous animals their habitats.
1.8.8.1.1. Con: A healthy planet needs the whole range of biodiversity which is created by the interrelations of millions of species. Therefore, valuing human life above other animal life will lead to a disproportionate ratio that will eventually hit us negatively.
1.8.9. Pro: The earth has been around much longer than humans, and thousands of species of animals have existed before us. Therefore, they should be valued over humans.
1.8.9.1. Con: It does not follow that 'all \(or some\) other animals' should be valued because they have been around longer than humans nor does it equate to the contrary.
1.9. Con: There are circumstances in which we must put animal lives ahead of human lives.
1.9.1. Con: This statement is only subjectively true, as the value of an animal is only determined by the value a human places on said animal. Objectively speaking, there is never a case where animal lives absolutely must be placed above human lives - we may think that way when we value an animal above a human, but such a belief has no objective truth to it.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Humans, as the only beings capable of placing value on other forms of life, are inherently of infinite value; nothing else has any value without it being given value by a human.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.9.1.2. Con: Human lives also have no objective value.
1.9.1.2.1. Con: [Sentiocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiocentrism) is a good moral system: when forced to choose, it is better to prefer the more intelligent creature. Of course, the difference in intelligence, to be relevant, has to be significant \(small variances in humans are common\).
1.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: Using their intelligence, a single human has the potential to improve the world for both humans and animals. Human lives are therefore more worth saving, as animals have no such potential.
1.9.1.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.1.1.3.3.
1.9.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: All intelligent phyla are already known to us. The most intelligent animals only approximate the average intelligence of a five year-old human child. That’s only a fraction of what an adult is capable of.
1.9.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Discoveries continue to be made regarding animal intelligence. We also do not know how many additional species we may find in the future.
1.9.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: It's only within the last decade that we discovered that [octopuses use tools](https://www.wired.com/2009/12/octopus-tools/).
1.9.1.2.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: [The earth](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/exploration.html) is 70% water and humans have only explored 5% of this. There is potential for more intelligent life to exist in the 95% we have not discovered.
1.9.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Actually, the entire ocean floor [has been mapped](http://moocs.southampton.ac.uk/oceans/2014/10/04/mapping-the-deep-and-the-real-story-behind-the-95-unexplored-oceans/). If there was a society of beings with intelligence equivalent to or greater than that of humans living down there, we'd have found them by now.
1.9.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Human civilization can already be detected](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00185.pdf) from over [25 trillion miles away](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/03/how-aliens-could-discover-life-on-earth-one-strange-rock-science/) using our current technology. It would be illogical to believe we could be oblivious to an equally advanced society of a different species living beneath our own oceans.
1.9.1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: No matter how hidden other species may be, we can logically determine that any intelligence on Earth approaching that of humans would be known to us by now. The signs of such advanced intelligence would be apparent as they would begin constructing a society, as humans have done.
1.9.1.2.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Before the New World was discovered by Europeans, whole societies of intelligent creatures \(humans\) remained "undiscovered". It is possible to build localized intelligent societies in locations not yet discovered.
1.9.1.2.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: With current technology, we could detect any such society anywhere on Earth. Obviously people in the 1400's didn't have access to such technology.
1.9.1.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.1.1.1.1.
1.9.1.2.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.4.1.1.
1.9.2. Pro: The value of a human life is not infinite, therefore there is some given number of animal lives that would be worth more.
1.9.3. Con: Sacrificing or rescuing an animal over a human is an individual decision at best, with many different factors.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.9.5. Con: Very few people would choose an animal over their own life. If you won't sacrifice yourself for an animal, it wouldn't be fair to sacrifice another human being for the sake of an animal, either. Claiming an animal life may be valued above a human life in any case is inherently hypocritical so long as the claimant is not willing to be the one sacrificed.
1.9.6. Pro: If a human is known to be an animal abuser or killer, it may be seen as justifiable to end that human's life as retribution for animals they have harmed in the past, and to prevent further harm to animals in the future.
1.9.7. Pro: It's about context. In certain scenarios, like saving the life of a trusted police dog by shooting the person attacking it, the life of an animal should undeniably be valued above that of a human.
1.9.7.1. Pro: The question of value is many-fold. The answer would be different if subjective value was examined, or if objective, universal value was the aim. Many individuals may prefer family members over neighbor, neighbor over stranger, stranger over animal. This value ladder is tied to their point of view. But if we look at life from universal perspective, there is no better or worse life worth saving. The statement is a fallacy. By omitting the point of view, it draws a [hasty generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy).
1.9.7.2. Pro: The life of a fertile individual of an endangered species would arguably be more valuable than that of their poachers, or any other human being for the matter. For example, the last male northern white [rhino](https://www.thedodo.com/rhino-guarded-day-and-night--1084636275.html) is guarded 24 hours a day to ensure his preservation. His life is considered more valuable than the poachers who set out to kill him.
1.9.7.3. Pro: In times of crisis, it is reasonable to believe people have the right to value animals over humans.
1.9.7.3.1. Con: Most animals operate at a lower level of intelligence than humans, therefore would be less likely to fully recognize, understand or appreciate such an act of sacrifice.
1.9.7.3.2. Pro: People will be distressed by decisions that leave animals to perish.
1.9.7.3.3. Pro: Saving animals can be part of a simple homeowner mission that is far safer than seeking humans in distress.
1.9.7.3.3.1. Con: This implies a negation of the ability to save the human. Therefore, the human vs animal choice is no longer in play.
1.9.7.3.3.2. Pro: It generally would not require specialized training to save animals.
1.9.7.3.4. Con: When a trade-off arises in a rescue operation that involves preferring one party over another, the rescuer has an obligation to proceed with binding preferences, which would mean saving a human person instead of an animal.
1.9.8. Pro: In specific cases, an animal could be capable of creating greater value than a human.
1.9.8.1. Pro: For example: A beloved house cat will likely create more value than a serial killer who will continue to murder.
1.9.9. Con: There are other circumstances where only humans could help. In the case of a catastrophe like a meteor or super volcano, animals can't save the world. Humans at least have a chance to try and save it. Imagine Noah's Ark: animals could not save the world in that kind of situation.
1.9.10. Pro: -> See 1.7.11.
1.9.11. Pro: -> See 1.9.7.3.
1.10. Pro: Human lives are superior to animal lives and therefore should be valued above them.
1.10.1. Pro: Humans generally live longer, so the loss would be greater.
1.10.1.1. Con: There are many species whose lifespan is longer than that of humans. No special consideration is granted to them.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: The [Galapagos tortoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galápagos_tortoise) can live into the 100s, longer than most humans.
1.10.2. Con: Humans may be unique in some aspects and animals in others. This difference in uniqueness does not equate to superiority.
1.10.2.1. Con: Some uniquenesses are more valuable than others. In the case of human intelligence being magnitudes greater than animal intelligence, one may suggest that this uniqueness is far superior to the unique ability of electric eels to discharge electricity, for example.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: Intelligence is not the only parameter of superiority on Earth, which benefits from the connected behaviors/actions of all species working in tandem with each other.
1.10.2.1.1.1. Con: The fact that humans are by far the most dominant species on Earth indicates that, as a matter of fact, intelligence is the parameter most important to determining superiority.
1.10.2.1.2. Pro: Advanced intelligence is the root cause of morality, creativity, and abstract thought, all of which are also unique to humans. All these qualities combined allow humans to do and achieve things no animal could. In this way, humans are definitively superior.
1.10.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.4.4.1.1.
1.10.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.7.4.4.1.1.
1.10.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.4.1.1.
1.10.3. Pro: A value system according to brain complexity and social intelligence is the most reasonable option we have: its a spectrum, with plants and bacteria at one end and humans at the other.
1.10.3.1. Con: Complexity of thought is not a merit. It's just a feature of humans. We could equally well optimize for other factors \(like fitness\) when comparing "quality".
1.10.3.1.1. Con: Complexity of thought is the one salient advantage that has allowed humans to become the dominant species on Earth. This alone proves how valuable a feature it is.
1.10.3.1.2. Pro: Thanks to the complexity of our thought, we've lost the advantage of natural selection, because now we can and do preserve human life and even reproduce with flaws that would have otherwise predestined individuals for certain death.
1.10.3.1.3. Pro: Complexity of thought is the one salient advantage that has enabled humans to become extremely dangerous to them selves and all life on Earth.
1.10.3.2. Pro: It is already widely agreed that mammals should be valued over simpler life forms like plants and bacteria.
1.10.3.2.1. Pro: Insects act on instinct and chemical signals alone.
1.10.3.3. Pro: Primates and dogs don't come close to the complexity of thoughts a human can have.
1.10.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.2.1.1.2.
1.10.4. Con: The idea that some lives matter more than other has lead to countless deaths, oppression and misery through out the history of the Homo sapiens sapiens \(us\). Such knowledge should makes us recognize the importance of equality.
1.10.5. Pro: Humans have a greater capacity for suffering, pleasure, and desire, the emotions relevant to moral consideration.
1.10.6. Pro: The flame of consciousness would go out with humanity. The fact we are aware of our existence brings value that was not previously present on earth.
1.10.6.1. Pro: Even though any animal species after our extinction may eventually evolve sentience, the resources necessary for another industrial revolution \(and eventually spaceflight and computer revolution\) no longer exist. Most shallow-buried fossil fuels have already been expended, so humanity is the only species that will ever reach this level of civilization.
1.10.6.1.1. Con: Fossil fuels are not the only energy source a technologically advanced species can use to sustain an industrialized and high-tech society.
1.10.6.2. Con: According to the [Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness), "humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals... also possess these neural substrates".
1.10.6.2.1. Pro: Presuming that other animals are not aware of themselves and of the world perhaps agrees easily with humans' immediate perception of reality, but it is not a self-evident truth. Descartes is known for having argued that animals are ["automata"](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/zombies/) lacking souls and consciousness. But these ideas were defied, for instance, by Voltaire who doubted that animals who show rich emotional lives, and who possess the biological means to feel, are mere machines \(check [regan.animalsvoice.com](http://regan.animalsvoice.com/animals-are-not-our-tasters/)\).
1.10.7. Pro: Humans are more intelligent than animals.
1.10.7.1. Con: Being the most intelligent animal means we might choose to save a non-human animal instead of a human in specific cases.
1.10.7.1.1. Pro: In a situation where a psychopathic human tortures and kills animals for fun, and they can only be stopped by ending their life, the case is not as clear cut as the thesis suggests.
1.10.7.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.1.1.
1.10.7.2. Con: Intelligence is a man-made marker and therefore is an unfair and biased tool for assessing the value of both humans and animals.
1.10.7.2.1. Pro: Intelligence tests are anthrocentric and cannot measure the possible features of intelligence that may exist in other species.
1.10.7.2.2. Pro: Animals observe, interact with, and learn from their environment in a different way than humans. Therefore, man-made measures of intelligence may not provide an accurate depiction of an animal's cognitive comprehension.
1.10.7.2.3. Pro: Intelligence scores are misleading and often [misinterpreted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3950413/).
1.10.7.2.3.1. Pro: A greater capacity to learn is not the same thing as being able to develop technologies and solve problems.
1.10.7.2.4. Pro: Many animals have acquired knowledge that we don't have, such as what food is poisonous or edible.
1.10.7.2.4.1. Con: Humans as a species understand far more about the world and why it works the way it does than any species of animal. Just because a specific animal knows more than a specific human does not therefore mean that animals are more intelligent than  humans generally.
1.10.7.2.4.1.1. Pro: Humans clearly understand foods that are and aren't poisonous. While animals can see this on an immediate level, humans can determine this at an immediate and long term levels.  We understand the long term effects of certain foods, down to what chemical compounds are safe and unsafe to eat.
1.10.7.2.4.1.1.1. Con: In most cases, humans cannot determine which foods are poisonous immediately/ instinctively as some animals can. Humans rely on this information being passed down through generations as verbal/written information.

Generational [teaching](http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8962000/8962747.stm) about such environmental dangers is also seen in some animals.
1.10.7.2.4.2. Pro: [Aposemantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism) describes the evolutionary process by which animals develop colorful warning signals - sounds, color, smell - to avoid predation and signal that eating them is unprofitable for the predator.
1.10.7.2.4.2.1. Pro: This adaptation has been successful enough that many harmless species [mimic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism#Mimicry) behavior or coloring of aposemantic species, resulting in less attacks from predators.
1.10.7.2.4.2.2. Pro: [Plants](http://research.haifa.ac.il/~biology/simcha/Publications/PIB20.pdf) have also adapted this strategy, sometimes mimicing aposemantic animals to scare off predators.
1.10.7.2.4.3. Pro: What counts as "intelligence" is a highly debatable concept, as explored by Ken Robinson in his [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity).
1.10.7.3. Pro: Only humans are capable of understanding art, science and philosophy.
1.10.7.3.1. Con: Human beings created art, science, and philosophy, so of course they would be privileged in understanding said subjects.This doesn't this mean that a human being who does not understand art, science, or philosophy is less valuable.
1.10.7.3.2. Con: This is untrue. Animals at the very least are able to appreciate art and music. [Many animals self-decorate](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/150610-animals-camouflage-decoration-bugs-science/), for instance, and many animals are not only [fond of music](https://www.livescience.com/33780-animal-music-pets.html), they have musical taste and exhibit a [preferences for music](https://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591\(15\)00060-X/abstract) which [caters to their species experiences.](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/09/01/rsbl.2009.0593)
1.10.7.3.3. Con: We do not yet know that animals don't have an understanding of science and philosophy, because we don't totally understand what it is that animals understand. [Many animals potentially possess a sense of self,](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/200907/do-animals-know-who-they-are) for instance, which is arguably an essential component of understanding philosophy.
1.10.7.3.4. Con: There is a lack of understanding of animal intelligence and no current method of complex inter-species communication. We are not able to perceive intelligence, but that does not mean it does not exist.
1.10.7.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.1.1.1.
1.10.7.3.4.2. Pro: Some [animals](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140723-are-we-the-only-creative-species) like gorillas, chimps, dolphins, and elephants in captivity have created [art](https://www.care2.com/causes/5-animals-who-make-art.html). To some, this capability is considered a form of [intelligence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2016/09/07/zoos-make-money-selling-paintings-made-by-animals-are-they-art/).
1.10.7.3.4.2.1. Pro: Male humpback whales in the wild have been [described](https://www.npr.org/2015/08/06/427851306/it-took-a-musicians-ear-to-decode-the-complex-song-in-whale-calls) as "inveterate composers" of songs that are "strikingly similar to human musical traditions".
1.10.7.3.4.2.2. Pro: Pigeons can [differentiate](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s100710100112) one human artist's work from another.
1.10.7.3.4.2.3. Pro: Sparrows have musical [preferences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037663579800014X) about which human musicians they want to listen to.
1.10.7.3.4.2.4. Pro: Bower birds build elaborately [decorated](http://www.core77.com/posts/26541/animal-architects-bowerbirds-design-build-showy-colorful-homes-to-attract-mates-26541) "bedrooms" to attract females. They choose specific colors of objects and arrange them in coordinated ways.
1.10.7.3.4.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.4.
1.10.7.3.4.2.6. Con: Gorillas, chimps, dolphins, and elephants in captivity have created [art](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140723-are-we-the-only-creative-species) with the help and will of humans who placed the materials \(paints/brushes\) in front of them.
1.10.7.3.4.2.6.1. Pro: In many cases, those animals have been forced to do so through [negative reinforcing](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40501667). This does not intrinsically come from them.
1.10.7.3.4.2.6.2. Con: -> See 1.10.7.3.4.2.1.
1.10.7.3.4.2.7. Con: The most artistic of animals can only create art at the complexity level of a young human.
1.10.7.3.4.2.7.1. Con: The art created by animals may be viewed as on par with [Jackson Pollock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock) and other abstract expressionists.
1.10.7.3.4.2.7.1.1. Con: Pollock's artistic intent can be proven. It can't be proven one way or the other whether animals doing something similar are intending to create art, or simply making a mess.
1.10.7.3.4.2.7.1.2. Con: If animals had artistic ability, they would be able to create other forms of art. If the one form of art that animals can create also happens to be the one that most looks like a random mess, logic dictates that it is, in fact, just a random mess.
1.10.7.3.4.2.7.1.2.1. Con: What is considered a random mess is subjective, as abstract as art has no linear form and is seen as beautiful to many.
1.10.7.3.4.2.7.1.2.1.1. Con: Computers can [randomly generate art](http://www.random-art.org/about/). Though some may consider it beautiful, that does not change the fact that it is purely random, and thus does not precisely match the definition of true art.
1.10.7.3.4.2.8. Con: Human art is a form of expression and is created with intent. There is no evidence of intent in the 'art' of animals. We would not place the scrawls of an infant alongside the work of Van Gogh because one is nonsense and the other is deeply considered and intricate, the work of a true artist.
1.10.7.3.4.2.8.1. Con: -> See 1.10.7.3.4.2.7.1.
1.10.7.3.5. Pro: Many different species have existed on planet Earth, some for far longer than humans, but none have had the engineering and technological advances humans have had.
1.10.7.3.5.1. Con: Technological advancement is not the only measure of evolved intelligence.
1.10.7.3.5.1.1. Con: It is the most salient measure of intelligence. No other product of intelligence will allow humans as a species to grow beyond the confines of our nature.
1.10.7.3.5.1.2. Con: Any other measure of intelligence would be suitable here as well. Humans excel far beyond animals in every other measure of intelligence.
1.10.7.3.6. Con: It is possible that human dominion over animals have suppressed their intellectual potential, and we have yet to see the full scale of what they can become.
1.10.7.3.6.1. Con: Complete separation already exists in many places around the world. Complex species can be found in such places. Yet, there are still no species that even come close to human intelligence.
1.10.7.3.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.9.1.2.1.1.2.1.
1.10.7.3.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.2.1.1.2.
1.10.7.3.6.1.3. Pro: The continent of Antarctica has remained virtually uninhabited by humans since the beginning of humanity itself. It is home to a great number of very complex species, many of which continue to exist in complete separation from humanity.
1.10.7.3.6.1.4. Pro: The depths of Earth's oceans are home to some of the most diverse forms of life. They exist in total separation from humans, as we don't live underwater, or anywhere near these creatures.
1.10.7.3.6.2. Con: Some animals are bred specifically for intelligence. Quite the opposite of impeding their progress; we’re actually speeding it up.
1.10.7.3.6.3. Pro: The domestication of animals and mass killing of others for food production \(e.g. chickens\) exemplifies how humans have overpowered many other animal species. It is possible that animals have only been able to develop to the point they are at by forcibly preventing them from evolving.
1.10.7.3.7. Con: The capability to understand such things does not make our lives more valuable than animal lives.
1.10.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.9.
1.10.7.5. Pro: Humans are the only species that can appreciate the beauty of the entire biosphere.
1.10.7.5.1. Pro: Our species is the only one capable of building technology beyond simple tools, and of understanding abstract concepts and planning non-instinctually \(rather than instinctive pseudo-planning behaviors such as bears going into hibernation\).
1.10.7.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.10.7.5.2. Con: Not all humans "appreciate the beauty" of the biosphere. Some wilfully harm it.
1.10.7.5.2.1. Con: Harm is a relative construct. Humans shape their environment to fit the human race better.
1.10.7.5.2.1.1. Con: In the vast majority of cases, harm to living things is objectively demonstrable.
1.10.7.5.2.2. Con: While some humans do harm the biosphere, this does not remove our ability as a species to appreciate the biosphere's beauty.

One can both recognize beauty and be willing to destroy it for personal gain.
1.10.7.5.3. Con: If we want to appreciate the beauty of the entire biosphere, we need to value animal life over human life sometimes in order to preserve that rich and diverse biosphere.
1.10.7.5.4. Con: Humans cannot directly experience the extreme deep sea, which means their relative appreciation for that part of the biosphere is less than that of the animals who inhabit it.
1.10.7.5.4.1. Con: The lack of direct experience does not represent an inherent inability to appreciate this part of the biosphere. In the future, technology might enable humans to travel the deep sea.
1.10.7.5.4.2. Con: Humans do [frequently write](https://offtheshelf.com/2015/07/11-books-to-explore-the-mysteries-of-the-ocean-deep/) and think about the beauty and otherness of the deep ocean, demonstrating their appreciation.
1.10.7.5.5. Con: There is no evidence that animals do not appreciate the beauty of Earth. It is possible that they simply appreciate it in a different way than humans measure it.
1.10.7.5.5.1. Pro: Animals have [evolved](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150511-why-are-animals-so-beautiful) an appreciation for beauty by choosing an aesthetically pleasing mate as [humans](https://aeon.co/essays/how-did-evolution-shape-the-human-appreciation-of-beauty) have, but express it differently. The same is possible for appreciating the beauty for other things necessary for survival, such as the Earth.
1.10.7.6. Con: Intelligence does not imply worth.
1.10.7.6.1. Pro: If intelligence determined worth then a severely mentally handicapped human would be less valued than a genius level African Grey Parrot, who is clearly more intelligent.
1.10.7.6.2. Con: Nowadays's established practice consists in giving a gradual range of rights to other animals, based on on their emotional and intellectual skills, as well as closeness to humans. So, in evaluating issues like this, one should remember that it doesn't have to be same rights vs none.
1.10.7.6.2.1. Pro: For example, experimenting with primates has many more restrictions than fruit flies.
1.10.7.6.3. Pro: For example, there are human beings with low intelligence quotients \(IQ\), however, it is deemed wrong to see them as less valued or worthy in society. Animals should be no different.
1.10.7.6.3.1. Con: The term mentalism covers the exact sort of prejudice where humans with lower IQs are deemed less worthy by society and discriminated against. Sometimes humans are deemed less valued or worthy by society.
1.10.7.6.3.1.1. Con: Society rewards intelligent people by having them do more important jobs and giving them higher salaries and recognition, but it doesn't value their lives more than other human beings. For example, it is not more immoral or more illegal to kill a very intelligent person than it is to kill a less intelligent person. No legal system in the world gives a higher prison sentence to someone who kills highly intelligent people.
1.10.7.6.3.1.1.1. Con: It is, however, generally considered less immoral to kill an animal than it is to kill a human. Hunting is perfectly legal in many places.
1.10.7.6.3.2. Con: Even the least intelligent functional humans are far smarter than any animal. It would be reasonable to value humans above animals on these grounds, even less intelligent humans.
1.10.7.6.4. Pro: Just because children are generally considered less intelligent than adults does not mean we value their lives less.
1.10.7.6.4.1. Con: Children have the potential to grow into individuals that may be even more intelligent than the adults raising them. They are considered by many to be even more valuable than adults, and one reason for this may be because of the potential they have when they grow up. No animal has the potential for intelligence like this, and thus should not receive the same level of value.
1.10.7.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.10.7.6.3.1.1.
1.10.7.7. Pro: At the very least only animals of a certain IQ or [Encephalization Quotient](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/encephalization-quotient) should be valued on a footing near to humans. This draws a necessary line between creatures that may be considered closer to motile, reactive nervous systems of little to no intelligence, and more sensitive, conscious organisms with greater self awareness.
1.10.7.8. Pro: Prioritizing animal above human life would be degrading to the human involved, and thus to all humanity.
1.10.7.8.1. Con: This claim is based on current human social mores: the idea that we humans are better or more important than animals is what leads to the feeling of degradation.

In the future, social mores may change to value animals, and prioritizing animal would not create a feeling of degradation to the human involved.
1.10.7.8.1.1. Pro: It was once [considered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation) degrading to white people for white people and African American people to drink out of the same water fountain.

We now understand this idea was indefensibly wrong.
1.10.7.8.1.1.1. Con: It was wrong only because humans of different races have been scientifically proven to be intellectually equal. The same cannot be said of animals, who are demonstrably inferior.
1.10.7.9. Con: Some animals are [very intelligent](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24628983/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/smartest-animals/).
1.10.7.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.1.
1.10.7.9.2. Con: -> See 1.9.1.2.1.1.2.
1.10.7.9.3. Pro: Humans have yet to fully [understand](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/humans-are-not-smarter-than-animals-we-just-dont-understand-them-9003196.html) the capacity of animal intelligence. Thus, it has yet to be discovered if they are in fact more intelligent than animals.
1.10.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.10.9. Pro: There are humans who would voluntarily die to benefit animals and nature at large, it is this singular potential to be that selfless that makes humanity more valuable.
1.10.9.1. Con: Most children have not yet developed the capacity for selflessness, and so by this logic are less valuable than adult humans.
1.10.9.1.1. Con: This is trivially false, as the original argument says it's the "potential to be selfless" that has value, and children definitely have that.
1.10.9.2. Con: There are [accounts](http://www.viralnova.com/animal-heroes/) of animals who have voluntarily risked their life to save humans as well. By this logic these animals should be valued over the humans who would not be this selfless.
1.10.9.2.1. Con: Dogs used by police, firefighters, and the military are bred and trained for their purpose. They do not voluntarily sign up for these life-threatening positions as humans do.
1.10.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.1.2.1.
