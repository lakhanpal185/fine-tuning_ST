Discussion Title: Is Jesus the Messiah?

1. Jesus is the promised Messiah of the ancient Hebrew religion.
1.1. Pro: Christianity claims Jesus was the Israelite Messiah according to the New Testament. Information about Jesus' his life, claims and mission are found therein.
1.1.1. Pro: Jesus was an outstanding moral teacher.
1.1.1.1. Con: This claim is not linked to the resolution. Not all outstanding moral teachers are messiahs.
1.1.1.2. Con: The Bible is filled with many examples of moral lessons by different teachers.
1.1.2. Pro: Jesus quoted prophecies in favour of his Messianic claim.
1.1.2.1. Pro: It was prophesied that Elijah/Elias would return before the Messiah came. [Malachi 4:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mal/4/5/s_929005) This was expected to occur literally.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Jesus explained that this prophecy was fulfilled figuratively in the person of John the Baptist. [Matthew 17:10-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/17/10/s_946010)
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Jesus explained that John the Baptist fulfilled the prophecies regarding Elijah/Elias' return. [Matthew 11:13-15](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/11/13/s_940013)
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Since Elijah/Elias has not physically returned until today, Jesus' intrepretation of this prophecy remains unchallenged.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Jesus explained certain passages which foretold his arrival. Starting from the books of Moses and onwards.[And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. Luke 24:27](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/24/27/s_997027)
1.1.2.3. Pro: Jesus quotes the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning himself.[And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. Luke 24:44](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/24/44/s_997044)
1.1.3. Pro: Prophecies made by Jesus have come true.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Jesus said to Peter, "Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times." [Matthew 26:34](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/mat/26/34/s_955034​) This was fulfilled in [Matthew 26:74](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/mat/26/74/s_955074) "Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know the man." And immediately the cock crowed."
1.1.3.2. Con: Some humans today claiming to be prophets spoke prophecies that have come to pass. However this doesn't mean they are a messiah.
1.1.4. Pro: The religious leadership subjected Jesus to various \(sincere and insincere\) trials and tests in order to judge him, Jesus passed these tests.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The Mosaic law states that false prophets must be killed. [Deu 13:5](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/deu/13/5/s_166005) The religious leaders sought to have a Jesus killed through a blasphemy charge even though they did not have any evidence.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The religious leaders of the time sought to kill Jesus by any means necessary. "Chief priests, elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none." [Matthew 26:59-60](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/26/59/s_955059)
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: After surviving the crucifixion, Jesus continued to maintain a distinction between himself and God. "Go to my brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God." [John 20:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/jhn/20/17/s_1017017)
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: "The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God." [John 19:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/19/7/s_1016007)
1.1.4.2. Pro: Jesus' religious knowledge was tested on many occasions until  [no one dared to ask him anymore questions. Matthew 22:46](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/mat/22/46/s_951046)
1.1.4.3. Pro: The religious leaders knew that if Jesus survived the crucifixion then he should be considered true in his Messianic claim. [If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.​ Matthew 27:42](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/27/42/s_956042)
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Jesus did not die on the cross and therefore passed [Deu 21:22's](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/deu/21/22/t_conc_174023) test.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: The New Testament records that Jesus was seen alive up to 40 days after being taken off the cross. [Acts 1:3](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/1/3/s_1019003)
1.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Many people saw Jesus alive and well after being taken off the cross which proves he did not die on the cross.
1.1.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: Paul the Apostle had experiences of Jesus after his death near Damascus. [Acts 9](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/9/1/s_1027001)
1.1.4.3.1.3. Pro: After being taken off the cross, Jesus denied being a spirit.[Luke 24:39](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/24/39/s_997039)
1.1.4.3.1.4. Pro: After being taken off the cross, Jesus met his followers and asked for food to eat. [Luke 24:41](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/24/41/s_997041)
1.1.4.4. Pro: A false charge of treason/sedition was leveled against Jesus. However, the governor of the time did not find him guilty rather saw him as a just man. [Mat 27:23-24](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/27/23/s_956023)
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? [John 18:35](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/18/35/s_1015035) Pilate went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. [John 18:38](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/18/38/s_1015038)
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: Pilate sought to release Jesus: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. [John 19:12](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/19/12/s_1016012)
1.1.4.5. Con: That's according to the New Testament. If we accept the New Testament, Jesus 'was' the Messiah. It's the NT we're questioning.
1.1.5. Pro: Jesus worked miracles that confirmed his divine mission.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Jesus [performed miracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles_of_Jesus#Cures) such as curing the blind, paralysis, and dropsy to name a few.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Jesus healed a blind man in John 9, Mark 8 & Mark 10. Just like Elisha healed a blind man, then caused an entire people to go blind, then caused them to see again. [2 King 6:17-19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/2ki/6/17/s_319017)
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: The first miracle Jesus demonstrated is mentioned in John 2. He turns 6 jars of water into wine \(20-30 gallons each\). Similiar to Moses' first miracle when he turned all the water in the land of Egypt into blood. [Exo 7:19-21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/exo/7/19/s_57019)
1.1.6. Pro: Jesus fulfilled many prophecies concerning the Messiah.
1.1.6.1. Pro: The prophet Daniel seems to predict the exact year of Jesus' birth as the time of the messiah's arrival.[jewsforjesus.org](https://jewsforjesus.org/publications/issues/issues-v05-n01/the-messianic-time-table-according-to-daniel-the-prophet/)
1.1.6.2. Con: The prophecy expressed in [Isaiah 2:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+2%3A4&version=NIV), "nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more" was clearly not fulfilled, since there have been many terrible wars since the time of Jesus.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: This prophecy, like much of the book of Isaiah, is dealing with the new creation: post-return of Jesus, post-resurrection of the dead.
1.1.6.3. Pro: [Psalm 22](https://www.biblica.com/bible/niv/psalm/22/) appears to describe the crucifixion of Jesus, for example in verse 16, "For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet."
1.1.6.3.1. Con: If this is prophecy, it appears to foretell the suffering an imposter would someday receive.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: There is no mention of an impostor in Psalm 22.
1.1.6.3.1.2. Pro: The idea that Jesus died on the cross disqualifies him from being a true Messiah.
1.1.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: Dying on the cross prevents him from carrying out the mission expected of him.
1.1.6.4. Pro: [Isaiah 7:14](https://www.biblica.com/bible/niv/isaiah/7/) appears to predict Jesus' virgin birth: "Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."
1.1.6.4.1. Con: The verse is mistranslated. The word for virgin in Hebrew is בְּתוּלָה bĕthuwlah. It is used 5 times by Isaiah. However, Isaiah 7:14 does not use the bĕthuwlah.
1.1.6.4.2. Con: Joseph is told to name the child "Jesus" rather than "Immanuel." [Matthew 1:21](https://www.blueletterbible.org/niv/mat/1/21/s_930021)
1.1.6.4.3. Con: If true, Jesus' birth would be the first sign in his favour. Yet [John 2:11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/jhn/2/11/s_999011) states his first sign was turning water into wine.
1.1.6.4.3.1. Con: The sign in Isaiah 7:14 came from the Lord God, the sign from John 2:11 came from Jesus, Son of God.
1.1.6.4.4. Con: The word עַלְמָה ʻalmâh is mistranslated here as "virgin". [Gesenius' Hebrew-Chaldee Lexicon states on p.634](https://archive.org/stream/hebrewchaldeelex00geseuoft#page/634/mode/2up): "The notion of unspotted virginity is not that which this word conveys"
1.1.6.5. Pro: [Deuteronomy 18:15](https://www.biblica.com/bible/niv/deuteronomy/18/) is a prophecy concerning a ministry by someone like Jesus: "The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken."
1.1.6.5.1. Con: Jesus is presented as God and the son of God rather than as a prophet as the prophecy states. Therefore he cannot be like Moses.
1.1.7. Pro: Many other figures in the New Testament identify Jesus as the Messiah.
1.1.7.1. Pro: When Jesus explained the prophecies which were in his favour people understood he was the Messiah.[And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? Luke 24:32](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/24/32/s_997032)
1.1.7.2. Pro: [In John 1:41](http://biblehub.com/john/1-41.htm), Andrew tells his brother Simon 'We have found the Messiah.', which means 'Christ'.
1.1.7.3. Pro: He was not expected to come from Galilee. ...some of the people said, "This is really the prophet." Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "Is the Christ to come from Galilee? [John 7:40-41](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/jhn/7/40/s_1004040)
1.1.7.4. Pro: After the crucifixion, Cleopas refers to Jesus as a prophet. "Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people."[Luke 24:19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/luk/24/19/s_997019)
1.1.7.5. Pro: In [John 4:25 - 4:26](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-4-25_4-26/), a woman believes Jesus to be the messiah and he verbally verifies it as being true.
1.1.7.6. Pro: [And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. Mat 21:11](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/21/11/s_950011)
1.1.8. Con: Those claims are only valid if the New Testament itself is. So far, the only reason to believe those claims to be accurate depictions of past events are based on this testament claiming them to be true.
1.1.9. Con: The writers of the New Testament \(mainly Paul and the authors of the Gospels\) could have fabricated stories of Jesus accomplishing feats that mirror the earlier prophesies.
1.1.10. Pro: God himself proclaimed Jesus was the Messiah.
1.1.10.1. Pro: According to the New Testament, "A voice came from heaven, "Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased." [Luke ‭3:22](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/luk/3/22/s_976022)‬ ‭
1.1.11. Pro: The "Star of Bethlehem" was probably real.
1.1.11.1. Pro: As seen from Babylon \(likely home of the Magi\), there was a perfect conjunction of Jupiter and Venus over Israel on June17, 2BC. It should have been the largest 'star' that anyone alive had ever seen.
1.1.12. Pro: Christianity is the largest religion in the world. Such a big 'tree' must have substantial roots.
1.1.12.1. Pro: Christianity grew enormously among the people in Judea and surrounding area while many of those alive at the time of his crucifixion were still alive.
1.1.13. Pro: For Christians, it is merely a question of faith. Historical evidence and physical proof are not required.
1.1.14. Con: The historicity of the New Testament is questionable.
1.1.14.1. Pro: The New Testament contains historical inaccuracies.
1.1.14.1.1. Pro: The circumstances of Jesus' birth are especially dubious \(with references to the Census of Quirinius occurring before the death of Herod, for example, which contradicts the historical record\).
1.1.14.2. Pro: The New Testament contains contradictions.
1.1.14.2.1. Pro: Jesus' genealogy - which must meet the conditions set by biblical prophecy - contains multiple contradictions between the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew.
1.1.14.2.1.1. Con: One of the genealogies may actually be Mary's.[zondervanacademic.com](https://zondervanacademic.com/blog/why-are-jesus-genealogies-in-matthew-and-luke-different/)
1.1.14.3. Pro: Information about Jesus is found in the New Testament. However this is a unsubstantiated resource. It is a compilation of writings by anonymous sources and in many cases forgers, all of whom had agendas.
1.1.14.3.1. Con: There are multiple outside sources that confirm Jesus actually lived. [probe.org](https://probe.org/ancient-evidence-for-jesus-from-non-christian-sources-2/) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sources_for_the_historicity_of_Jesus)
1.1.14.3.1.1. Con: Being alive does not make Jesus a messiah. It just confirms he was a living human being.
1.1.14.3.1.1.1. Pro: Having lived is necessary to being the Messiah. If he did live, he had the 'opportunity'.
1.1.14.4. Con: The historicity of the entire Bible is questionable to certain groups of people, however most who follow it have faith that what is written there is truth.
1.1.15. Con: Some Christians do not accept that Jesus was the Messiah. Pastor John Hagee argues Jesus was not the Messiah in his book, "In Defense of Isreal." [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KaDX6yjKt4)
1.2. Pro: Islam claims Jesus was the Israelite Messiah. Information about Jesus' life, claims and mission are found in the Holy Quran.
1.2.1. Pro: God himself proclaimed Jesus was the Messiah.
1.2.1.1. Pro: "The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a Messenger; surely, Messengers like unto him had indeed passed away before him. And his mother was a truthful woman." [Holy Quran 5:76](https://www.alislam.org/quran/5:76)
1.2.1.2. Pro: "When the angels said, ‘O Mary, Allah gives thee glad tidings of a word from Him; his name shall be the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, honoured in this world and in the next, and of those who are granted nearness to God."[Holy Quran 3:46](https://www.alislam.org/quran/3:46)
1.2.2. Pro: Islam teaches that Jesus was the Messiah for the Israelites while disagreeing with some Christian views about his person.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Islam does not teach that Jesus was God incarnate, or the Son of God, but rather that he was a mere human and the Messiah for the Israelite. [4:172](https://www.alislam.org/quran/4:172)
1.2.2.2. Pro: Muslims universally [believe](https://books.google.com/books?id=iJmcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q&f=false) that Jesus did not die on the cross.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Muslims universally believe that Jesus was [saved from](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=C1cQBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA14&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) the attack on his life. Though there is a difference of opinion on what happened afterwards.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Islam agrees that Jesus had a miraculous birth and that his mother was not guilty of having an illicit relationship.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.2.3. Pro: Although mainstream Judiasm rejects Jesus' Messiahship, it is necessary for ethnic Jews who accept Islam to believe in him as the Jewish Messiah, as part and parcel of their new found religion. This understanding of Jesus does not contract Jewish theology.
1.2.4. Pro: The theology taught by Jesus is consistent with Judaism.
1.2.4.1. Pro: "Said Jesus: ‘Surely, Allah is my Lord, and your Lord. So worship Him alone; this is the right path.’" [19:37](https://www.alislam.org/quran/19:37)
1.3. Pro: Some Jews claim Jesus was the Messiah. Judaism relies upon the Tanakh and Rabbinical texts for its religious teachings. Information about how to evaluate Jesus' claims and mission are found therein.
1.4. Pro: Early Israelite Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah before the compilation of the New Testament.
1.4.1. Pro: The early followers of Jesus accepted him after seeing his works, hearing his talks, or witnessing the miracles shown by him.
1.4.2. Con: Before the New Testament was compiled, many contradictory beliefs existed among Christians.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Christians disagreed on the nature of God. Some Christians believed in only one God; others, claimed that there were two Gods; yet others subscribed to 30, or 365, or more.

1.4.2.2. Pro: Some Christians accepted the Hebrew Scriptures as a revelation of the one true God, others claimed that the Scriptures had been inspired by an evil deity.[\(The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture\)](https://books.google.ca/books?id=4huzYVCcLzwC&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=In+the+second+and+third+centuries+there+were,+of+course,+Christians+who+believed+in+only+one+God;+others,+however,+claimed+that+there+were+two+Gods;+yet+others+subscribed+to+30,+or+365,+or+more.&source=bl&ots=_FpTL6mN-W&sig=SUo4bpI-R19TOVBuBHUaIn6N3LY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2-p77ydzdAhXH1IMKHfElAcEQ6AEwCXoECGEQAQ#v=onepage&q=In%20the%20second%20and%20third%20centuries%20there%20were%2C%20of%20course%2C%20Christians%20who%20believed%20in%20only%20one%20God%3B%20others%2C%20however%2C%20claimed%20that%20there%20were%20two%20Gods%3B%20yet%20others%20subscribed%20to%2030%2C%20or%20365%2C%20or%20more.&f=false)
1.4.2.3. Pro: Some Christians believed that Christ was somehow both a man and God; others said that he was a man, but not God; others claimed that he was God, but not a man; others insisted that he was a man who had been temporarily inhabited by God. [\(The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture\)](https://books.google.ca/books?id=4huzYVCcLzwC&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=In+the+second+and+third+centuries+there+were,+of+course,+Christians+who+believed+in+only+one+God;+others,+however,+claimed+that+there+were+two+Gods;+yet+others+subscribed+to+30,+or+365,+or+more.&source=bl&ots=_FpTL6mN-W&sig=SUo4bpI-R19TOVBuBHUaIn6N3LY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2-p77ydzdAhXH1IMKHfElAcEQ6AEwCXoECGEQAQ#v=onepage&q=In%20the%20second%20and%20third%20centuries%20there%20were%2C%20of%20course%2C%20Christians%20who%20believed%20in%20only%20one%20God%3B%20others%2C%20however%2C%20claimed%20that%20there%20were%20two%20Gods%3B%20yet%20others%20subscribed%20to%2030%2C%20or%20365%2C%20or%20more.&f=false)
1.4.2.4. Pro: Some Christians believed that Christ's death had brought about the salvation of the world; others claimed that his death had no bearing on salvation; yet others alleged that he had never even died. [\(The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture\)](https://books.google.ca/books?id=4huzYVCcLzwC&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=In+the+second+and+third+centuries+there+were,+of+course,+Christians+who+believed+in+only+one+God;+others,+however,+claimed+that+there+were+two+Gods;+yet+others+subscribed+to+30,+or+365,+or+more.&source=bl&ots=_FpTL6mN-W&sig=SUo4bpI-R19TOVBuBHUaIn6N3LY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj2-p77ydzdAhXH1IMKHfElAcEQ6AEwCXoECGEQAQ#v=onepage&q=In%20the%20second%20and%20third%20centuries%20there%20were%2C%20of%20course%2C%20Christians%20who%20believed%20in%20only%20one%20God%3B%20others%2C%20however%2C%20claimed%20that%20there%20were%20two%20Gods%3B%20yet%20others%20subscribed%20to%2030%2C%20or%20365%2C%20or%20more.&f=false)
1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.14.
1.6. Con: The salvation mission attributed to Jesus by Christians is foreign to the Hebrew religion.
1.6.1. Pro: Christianity introduces a godhead which is foreign to Hebrew theology.
1.6.1.1. Pro: [Judaism has always espoused a strict monotheism and had no concept of the Trinity. Our Sages' use of the term, “Holy Spirit,” never supposes a division within the Godhead.](https://www.beth-elsa.org/Worship/Sermons/Guest_Speakers/Do_Jews_Believe_in_the_Holy_Spirit_01_15_10)
1.6.1.2. Pro: [Basic to the faith of the Bible and of the Jewish People is the distinction between God and man, a distinction which is contradicted in mainstream Christianity by the belief that Jesus was the literal son of God, or even God Himself.](http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org/explanation8.html)
1.6.2. Pro: Christianity introduces “inherited sin.” This is foreign to Hebrew theology.
1.6.2.1. Pro: [The doctrine of original sin is totally unacceptable to Jews \(as it is to Christian sects such as Baptists and Assemblies of G-d\)... the dominant view by far was that man sins because he is not a perfect being, and not, as Christianity teaches, because he is inherently sinful.](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/judaism-s-rejection-of-original-sin)
1.6.3. Pro: Christianity introduces a re-purposed crucifixion. Hebrew theology states that this punishment is definitive proof of impurity, guilt and estrangement from God. A true Messiah/prophet cannot die an accursed death.
1.6.3.1. Con: Jesus being nailed to the cross was not punishment, inasmuch as it was an atonement. Because he was unblemished in the eyes of God, this was not an accursed death.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: Christians believe Jesus became accursed by dying on the cross. "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us--for it is written, 'Cursed be every one who hangs on a tree'" [Galatians 3:13](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/gal/3/13/s_1094013)
1.6.3.1.2. Con: Israelite law states in Deuteronomy 13 that a person who tries to take the Hebrew people [away from the God](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/deu/13/2/s_166002) they know is [evil](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/deu/13/5/s_166005). He should be [rejected](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/deu/13/3/s_166003) and put to death, even if the person preformed [miracles and signs.](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/deu/13/2/s_166002) This is exactly what Jesus was accused of doing.
1.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.3.
1.6.3.2. Pro: [\(Deu 21:23\)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/deu/21/23/s_174023) states that such a criminal is impure and defiles the earth. This is a description no true Prophet/Messenger/Messiah could ever have.
1.6.3.2.1. Con: It is not clear how this passage is relevant. The passage describes a proper burial rite - even one that Jesus fulfills, as he was buried in a tomb the same day.
1.6.3.3. Pro: [\(Deu 21:23\)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/deu/21/23/s_174023) states that such a criminal is accursed of God. This is a description no true Prophet/Messenger/Messiah could ever have.
1.6.3.4. Pro: Death via this punishment proved the person had committed a great sin. [Deu 21:22](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/deu/21/22/s_174022)
1.6.4. Pro: Christianity introduces concepts of atonement which are foreign to Judaism. According to Hebrew theology forgiveness, atonement and salvation were already attainable to Hebrews and other peoples through Divine Grace or prayers, fasting and sacrificial offerings.
1.6.4.1. Pro: According to Judaism,["Sin and defilement damage the relationship between creature and Creator, and the process of atonement – through repentance and reparation – restores this relationship."​](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/atonement)
1.7. Con: He was not the sort of Messiah many of his contemporaries were expecting.
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.
1.7.3. Con: The religious leadership was not honest in evaluating Jesus' claims.
1.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.7.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.
1.7.3.3. Pro: They sought to kill Jesus before hearing his own testimony.
1.7.3.3.1. Pro: [John 7:50-51](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jhn/7/50/s_1004050) - Nicodemus said unto them, \(he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,\) Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
1.7.3.3.2. Pro: [John 7:1](https://www.blueletterbible.org/rsv/jhn/7/1/s_1004001) - After this Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.7.5. Pro: In Judaism, no one is currently being awaited to fulfill the mission Christians claim Jesus came for.
1.7.6. Con: Expectation and pride are not extolled as traits of Old Testament prophets and prophecy.
1.7.7. Con: Contemporary expectation does not change prophetic anticipation.
1.7.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.1.2.
1.8. Con: We only have the testimony of Jesus' disciples to support many of the claims about him.
1.8.1. Con: Romans and religious leaders would have found his body if possible.
1.8.2. Con: The apostles kept preaching despite the danger of doing so.
1.8.3. Con: Luke was careful to explore the claims and was as close to an investigative journalist of the 1st century as it comes. [Luke 1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1%3A1-4&version=NIV)
1.8.4. Con: Many of these disciples died defending the claims.
1.8.4.1. Con: We can't be sure that the apostles actually died for their claims. Many of the stories of the martyrdom of the apostles were propogated as mere legends in the early Christian church, and these legends are even less reliable than the gospels themselves.
1.8.4.2. Con: Just because someone dies supporting something doesn't mean it's true.
1.8.5. Pro: Dedicated followers, or disciples, would be biased about the status of Jesus.
1.8.6. Pro: Some of the 11 apostles doubted Jesus' till the end. [Mat 28:17](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/mat/28/17/s_957017)
1.9. Con: The answer to this question varies depending on religious and spirituality beliefs.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.9.5. Pro: Other figures have verbally claimed to be the messiah as well, such as [Sabbatai Zevi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi) and [Bar Kokhba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kokhba_revolt).
