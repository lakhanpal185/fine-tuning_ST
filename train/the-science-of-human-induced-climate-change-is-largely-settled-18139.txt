Discussion Title: The science of human-induced climate change is largely settled.

1. The science of human-induced climate change is largely settled.
1.1. Con: It is more settled by science the fact that climate is changing very fast. The fact that is human-induced is less important and less settled.
1.1.1. Con: It is highly important that we recognise that the change is human caused, because we need to know why and how to change the way we get our energy.
1.1.2. Con: There is no significant controversy in the scientific community about whether humans are the cause of the changing climate.
1.1.2.1. Pro: [Changes in the luminosity of the sun do not account for increases in temperature](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.05397.pdf)
1.1.2.2. Pro: The hypothesis of climate change contrarians is that "Humans can enhance Earth's Greenhouse Effect indefinitely without compromising the security of our present civilisation". This hypothesis is not consistent with the facts, and is therefore false.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: This hypothesis is a 'straw man' that doesn't represent Skeptics. [The skeptics questioning the models](http://www.drroyspencer.com/my-global-warming-skepticism-for-dummies/) do believe CO2 is a GHG and that man is driving the increase in CO2 levels \(settled science\). Where they earn the title "skeptic" is from questioning the assumptions behind additional feedbacks \(H2O\) which deliver the majority of projected warming in the models \(not settled science\).
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: This is a misreading of the parent claim. The essential core of the contrarian position is that we can continue to burn fossil carbon without any adverse consequences. Their objection to models is just one argument among many.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Though contrarians criticise the scientists at every point, and often contradict each other, they share one single aim, which is that humans can continue to use fossil carbon as an energy source.
1.1.2.2.1.3. Con: Roy Spencer in the link given above says " I consider climate models as being our best way of exploring cause and effect in the climate system. It is really easy to be wrong in this business, and unless you can demonstrate causation with numbers in equations, you are stuck with scientists trying to persuade one another by waving their hands"
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: This hypothesis is refuted by consideration of [the chain of causation of AGW.](https://www.kialo.com/argument/18139.24)
1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: The Greenhouse Effect is a simple physical fact, based on the mathematics of [Black-body Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation). Earth temperature T is +15C. Without Greenhouse Effect T = -18C.
1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Nikolov and Zeller claim that the GHE does not exists, and that they can predict the surface temperature of planets \(except Triton\) using only data of atmospheric pressure.
1.1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Numerous flaws, which are set out [here,](http://paper, which are set out here,) are present in N+Z paper. It is noteworthy that the debunker, Willis Eschenbach, is himself a climate sceptic.
1.1.2.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Roy Spencer, another scientist who is on the climate sceptic side, also refutes N&Z in a very clear way without using formulae [here](http://www.drroyspencer.com/2011/12/why-atmospheric-pressure-cannot-explain-the-elevated-surface-temperature-of-the-earth/).
1.1.2.2.2.1.1.3. Con: Nikolov claims that during the ice age cycles, the atmosphere lost and gained huge amounts of gas, many orders of magnitude greater than the gains and losses which we can observe now. ‬ ‪This claim is literally incredible. Unbelievable and false.
1.1.2.2.2.1.2. Con: Many contrarians attempt to claim that the greenhouse effect violates the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics because the GHE requires that heat flows from the cool atmosphere to the warmer Earth surface.
1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con: The above claim misunderstands what is happening. Heat flows from the warm earth surface into the atmosphere by convection, conduction and radiation in accordance with the Second Law. Any infra red \(IR\) radiation that hits a GHG then re-radiates the IR, in all directions, including back to the earth surface. [This video explains this aspect in more detail.](http://Mrs Nicky Lawson Walnut House, Dolberrow, Churchill, North Somerset, BS25 5NT 01934 853606 John Penrose MP House of Commons London SW1A 0AA Thank you for your email of 18th September about fracking. The distinction between exploratory drilling for fracking and fracking itself is a fine one. After all, if the exploratory drilling gives favourable results to the corporation behind the drilling, they are not going to walk away saying, “Well that was interesting, but let’s just leave it, shall we?” To compare an exploratory drilling operation to putting up a conservatory in planning terms is simply ludicrous as I am sure you must agree privately, though I would not expect you to dare to express this thought in public. I am glad that you feel that we should not alter our existing commitments to use green energy and boost our proportion of renewables. I would stress that expansion of renewables must go hand in hand with rapid research and development of a wide variety of storage techniques – not just batter-ies, but also electrolysis, thermal, kinetic, potential and other innovative methods, in order to com-pensate for the intermittent nature of renewables. Also, of course, far more could be done in the field of energy conservation, which offers huge opportunities for worthwhile, economically produc-tive low skilled jobs. There is much more to be said about environmental and human health threats from fracking, but I want to focus on one thing that you said. “Personally, I'd only be prepared to support fracking if local communities are clear they approve of it”. Earlier this year I participated in a house to house survey of the residents of Hutton. The result was that a resounding 87% of residents \(and your constituents\) opposed fracking, declaring that they withheld their consent from fracking in their parish. Please see the full details on the attached sheet, Hutton Fracking Survey Results. I hope you will agree that this is convincing evidence that local communities do not approve of fracking, and that you will join us in opposing the Government’s plans to impose fracking, and ex-ploratory drilling, in your constituency. Yours sincerely, Yours sincerely)
1.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: If the IR radiation was unable to go back towards Earth, an electric stove would not work when pointed at the Sun. Radiation does not "know" where it will end up. It leaves a hot body when the body is warmer than its immediate surroundings.
1.1.2.2.2.1.3. Pro: The Infra-red \(IR\) radiation coming back to the earth surface from GHGs, can be observed. [See Philipona et al. 2012](https://www.gruan.org/documentation/articles/philipona-et-al-2012-grl/)
1.1.2.2.2.1.4. Con: [Casey](http://geologist-1011.net/net/greenhouse/) attempts to refute the GHE, saying "Compositional variation can change the distribution of heat within a body in accordance with Fourier's Law, but it cannot change the overall temperature of the body".
1.1.2.2.2.1.4.1. Con: Casey misunderstands Fouriers Law which describes the conduction of heat. If a body is heat-saturated in an oven and then placed un-heated in a vaccuum, the position of any insulating material will be very significant for the temperature of that body. Put a skim of high insulation over the surface and the body remains hotter than if the same insulation material is placed at the centre of the body.
1.1.2.2.2.1.5. Pro: Satellites measure Short Wave heat entering the atmosphere from the Sun, and also Infra Red heat radiated by the Earth. Analyses show that there is a downward trend in heat leaving since the 1970s, and that the frequencies being trapped are the same as those that are absorbed by Greenhouse Gases \(GHGs\). \([Harries et al 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35066553)\)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6. Pro: CO2 is a Greenhouse Gas \(GHG\), a physical fact based on its atomic structure. CO2 is responsible for 9-36% of the total Greenhouse Effect \(GHE\).
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.1. Con: Contrarians argue that CO2 is present in minute concentrations in the atmosphere.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.1.1. Con: 94.04% of the atmosphere is composed of non-greenhouse gases - Nitrogen, Oxygen and Argon. Greenhouse gases comprise just 0.52% of the atmosphere.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Pointing at small absolute numbers hides the fact that the concentration has nearly doubled.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.1.1.2. Con: But those GHGs that comprise just 0.52% of the atmosphere by weight, also comprise 100% of the Greenhouse Effect by *function*, by virtue of the physical properties of their molecular configuration.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.1.2. Con: The important aspect is not the concentration by weight, but the radiative effect of the gases, which varies with local conditions, especially cloudiness, but [ranges are given as](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2010/2010_Schmidt_sc05400j.pdf): Water Vapour ~50%, clouds ~25%, CO2~20%, with CH4, N2O, 03 and CFCs making up the remainder
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Moreover, water vapour stays in the atmosphere for only a few days, whereas [the effect of CO2 may persist for centuries.](https://skepticalscience.com/co2-residence-time.htm)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.2. Pro: The fact that CO2 and other GHGs block transmission of infra red energy can be demonstrated by laboratory experiments. There are no laboratory experiments that show that GHGs do not trap heat.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.3. Pro: The greenhouse effect of CO2 is confirmed by analysis of long-wave \(Infra-red, IR\) radiation, which confirms that CO2 and other [GHGs are causing downwelling Infrared radiation](https://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2006/techprogram/paper_100737.htm).
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.3.1. Pro: [Observations confirm](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14240) that changes in clear sky down-welling Infrared radiation are in line with changes in CO2.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.3.2. Pro: [Satellite observations by Harries et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/35066553)confirm that changes in outgoing long-wave \(Infra red\) radiation between 1970 and 1997 are due to greenhouse gases.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4. Pro: We have increased the concentration of CO2 by 40% from pre-industrial levels, and are on course to doubling those levels sometime around 2075.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1. Pro: The effect on Earth Temperature \(T\) of doubling CO2 levels lies somewhere between 1.5 and 4.5 C, with the most likely figure in the 2.5-3C range.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1. Pro: +2C for doubling is interesting because it lies at the higher end of the range agreed by AGW contrarians/skeptics, and at the lower end of the range accepted in the climatology community. Therefore it can be seen as a super-consensus figure.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: Already, at +1C above pre-industrial levels of CO2 we are able to discern serious effects on weather events. [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/10/extreme-weather-manmade-climate-change) [www.worldweatherattribution.org](https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/about/)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: If the effect of a +2C increase in T would be mild, as contrarians claim, we would not be able to observe any changes at +1C. Since we are able so to do, the contrarian hypothesis is refuted.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The 2C rise on doubling of CO2 levels is only a step on the way. If CO2 continues to be added to the atmosphere - Temperatures will continue to increase. [Here are the full expected effects of temperature rise.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/21/study-reveals-greater-climate-impacts-of-2c-temperature-rise-heatwaves)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Each extreme weather event that can be attributed to man-made climate change is a further refutation of the climate contrarian hypothesis.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The Gulf Stream is showing evidence of weakening. If it shots down completely, it will have very serious consequences for Northern Europe \(coldness\) and the eastern seaboard of the USA \(raised sea levels\) [www.cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/global-warming-is-slowing-atlantic-ocean-circulation-study-finds/)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Contrarians predict that CO2 rises will not cause water shortages, but [the Colorado River flows are diminishing, and this is attributable to global warming](http://Colorado river declining in volume https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018WR023153)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Arctic warming has produced waves in the Northern polar Jet Stream which brings cold weather southwards [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/08/summer-unending-rain)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.4. Pro: Studies have linked AGW with 4 extreme events: record temperatures, coral bleaching, droughts in Africa, and wildfires in the USA [www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/climate/climate-extreme-weather-attribution.html)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.5. Pro: The contrarian hypothesis predicts that the probability of heatwaves will not be increasing at a situation where CO2 is only 33% increased over pre-industrial levels. This prediction is refuted by the facts.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.5.1. Pro: [It is very likely that human influence doubled the probability of the European heatwave of 2003](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03089.epdf?referrer_access_token=QVA8BxgtrUzF8BF3L9GrTtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OnBzxb7ThjtOwH-zBjavvOmrkXK6aC-FB24MdRTE0LLfa-zguqGzxxAQuopWzTHQfBwMQnaU_8GSzyLoJBTmjd-v9BBhj7s7ojfQWqxWOaEAfnLYhdWP0ajQkbqD3ZNjnqdcL-h31Tc1czghhovav5giH0xx4HevK4PYYaJmFc3_fijjEj_EDDusGniIsm_3o2j706sZ6sl2dvBql64EKm&tracking_referrer=www.carbonbrief.org)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.5.2. Pro: NOAA finds that human-caused climate change made the [heatwaves of 2015 more likely](https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/scientists-strong-evidence-human-caused-climate-change-intensified-2015-heat-waves)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.5.3. Pro: [Extreme heat is defining climate change](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/extreme-heat-climate-change-19641)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.6. Pro: Here is a page showing a [large number of extreme weather events that are linked to AGW](https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world) - as well as those that are not.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.7. Pro: The contrarian hypothesis predicts that the probability of flooding will not be increased by a 33% increase of CO2 levels. This prediction is falsified by studies.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.7.1. Pro: A study shows that man-made changes to climate [increased the probability of the floods in England and Wales in 2000](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09762)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.7.2. Pro: Observed increased [rainfall intensity in the latter half of the twentieth century cannot be explained by estimates of natural climate variability - human influences must be considered](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09763)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.7.3. Pro: It is certain that extreme rainfall is increasing. This is easily measurable in rain gauges. In a simple but elegant study, [Seth Westra of the University of Adelaide looked at 8000 rain gauges from 1900 to 2009](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00502.1), and concluded that for every 1C rise in temperature, there will be a 7% increase in extreme rainfall intensity. This is in line with theoretical projections, since warmer air can hold more moisture.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.8. Pro: Contrarian hypothesis predicts that man-made climate change cannot make hurricanes more intense. Their hypothesis is refuted by the facts
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.8.1. Pro: Climate change [increased the rainfall of Hurricane Harvey](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/climate-change-study-hurricane-harvey-flood/)
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.8.2. Pro: [Here is evidence](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-09/giot-hag090905.php) for an increase in Cat 4/5 hurricanes worldwide. Doubled in 35 yrs. Total numbers of hurricanes falling, except in N Atlantic.
1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Some [extreme heat events in 2016 would not have been possible without AGW](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/publications/bulletin-of-the-american-meteorological-society-bams/explaining-extreme-events-from-a-climate-perspective/abstract/)
1.1.2.3. Pro: [Increases in CO2 are due to human activity](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/)
1.1.3. Con: Human-induced climate change is settled; the long term graphs show the data. It is also very important because the rate of change is immensely great for any animals to adapt naturally, including humans.
1.1.4. Con: [Here is a convenient summary of the 10 pieces of evidence that show recent warming to be due to human activity](https://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/Human_Fingerprints_1024.jpg)
1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.2. Con: Many of the basic components of the human contribution to changing climate, like the contribution of greenhouse gasses, are settled. The portions are are not settled are related to how much these factors are affecting a natural cycle in climatology, as we just left an ice age in the middle ages, and are part of a general upward trend in temperatures that predated it. Additionally, the techniques used to generate data often provide values that are within the margin of error for the measurement.
1.2.1. Con: Rate of recovery from a colder to warmer state is rapid initially, and then slows down as the cold event recedes into history. The observed warming of Earth is increasing as time goes on. Therefore we cannot attribute present warming simply to recovery from the LIA.
1.2.2. Con: The above claims are confused. There was a Mediaeval \(Middle Ages\) Warm Period circa 920-1250, followed by a Little Ice Age circa 1300-1850.
1.3. Con: Expert opinion is just that -- opinion. Climate scientists have a vested interest in keeping their research going. Therefore, one cannot take scientists' "word" for it.
1.3.1. Con: If you want to make the bucks and stop having to worry about funding your research, come up with a supported argument that contradicts the predominant conclusions.
1.3.2. Con: Stating that an expert opinion is the same as any opinion is fallacious and based off mis-use of the word "opinion". Scientists rarely ask for their "word" to be taken, since scientific publications must always contain data supporting their conclusions and the scientific method always requires studies to be reproducible. Not bothering to read the fine details of their data and methods doesn't mean these "opinions" are unsupported.
1.3.3. Con: Scientists do research for a living. However, they rarely have a vested interest in coming to any particular conclusion.
1.3.4. Con: Oil companies and other large corporations are funding climate research as well, so the bias actually works the other way around in some instances.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Big oil was behind the science 30 years ago, and while they may still be studying it, it is clear that most of the misinformation published about climate science is funded by people like the [Kochs](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dark-money-funds-climate-change-denial-effort/) & [Exxon Mobil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil_climate_change_controversy), who have funnelled as much as $500 Million to groups pushing denial.
1.3.5. Con: There is common opinion, and there is a separate thing, opinion that has been tested by methodical scientific research designed to falsify that opinion. If the opinion survives repeated testing, it is accepted by scientists as fact, not opinion.
1.3.6. Con: By this logic, we can't trust any professional, scientist or otherwise. Given the complexity of climate study, they have no shortage of work regardless.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Most people don't take their broken down car to a doctor or have their back pain checked by a mechanic.
1.3.7. Con: The scientist "job security" argument appears frequently when it comes to climate science, yet one struggles very hard to remember any other time when this claim was made about a group of scientists studying a particular problem. If there is a conspiracy, it would involve thousands of international scientists.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.5. Con: Increased 'radiative forcing' from higher CO2 levels is settled science, but the additional 'feedbacks' \(mostly from H2O\) are not settled science. These feedbacks account for the majority of projected warming.
1.6. Con: Some aspects of climate change are difficult to measure.
1.6.1. Pro: The degree of climate change is uncertain in some models, and specific aspects of climate change remain uncertain.
1.6.1.1. Pro: How fast [tropospheric warming](http://www.greenfacts.org/en/climate-change-ar5-science-basis/l-3/6-uncertainties-climate-change.htm) is changing is only certain with low to medium confidence.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Reading the whole article from which this uncertainty comes from at [greenfacts.org](https://www.greenfacts.org/en/climate-change-ar5-science-basis/index.htm#6), one finds all of the accepted conclusions of climate change in the first section. The uncertainties that remain are tiny details that are needed to have a hyper accurate assessment, but in no way cast doubt on theory as a whole.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Prior to 1951 changes to [precipation rate changes](http://www.greenfacts.org/en/climate-change-ar5-science-basis/l-3/6-uncertainties-climate-change.htm) are uncertain.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.1.
1.6.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.2.1.6.4.1.1.1.1.2.7.3.
1.6.1.3. Con: Models both hind-cast and forecast Earth surface temperature with skill and accuracy [www.carbonbrief.org](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming)
1.6.1.4. Con: The degree of climate change is very certain according to actual historical temperature records.
1.6.2. Con: Of course. That's what science is about - addressing uncertainties, details that exist at the periphery. But at the core of every science stand established facts that have survived repeatedly tests, and which provide a useful,[coherent picture of the state of affairs](https://www.kialo.com/argument/18139.24).
1.6.3. Con: This is a form of the [argument from incredulity](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument_from_incredulity) Just because something is difficult to accomplish does not mean it didn't happen.
1.7. Con: The relative inaccuracy of weather predictions over even the very short term undermines the idea that our current science understands climate and weather well enough to establish predictive power for climate in general, especially large scale changes in the long term.
1.7.1. Con: There is a vast difference between weather predictions and climate predictions. Weather has to depict a huge array of interwoven possibility. Climate prediction is essentially about predicting one figure, the average surface temperature of Earth.
1.7.2. Con: The path of an individual ball in a [Galton pegboard](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AGalton_box.webm) is difficult to predict, but the statistical average can be computed very precisely. The same goes for weather. Changes in the statistical average of weather are being predicted well, based on the well-supported understanding that the climate is storing energy.
1.8. Con: Several features of drastic climate changes, specifically negative and positive feedback loops, have not been observed under the predicted higher temperatures. And may well be able to offset the greenhouse gas effect. [climate.nasa.gov](https://climate.nasa.gov/nasa_science/science/)
1.8.1. Con: Negative feedback from clouds/aerosols is [smaller than previously thought](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24672). \(Easier reading, [here](https://phys.org/news/2017-12-more-severe-climate-accurate.html).\) Arguments that depended on this negative feedback have been [debunked](https://books.google.com/books?id=klerAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA69). This means that theoretical models have been underestimating future warming.
1.8.1.1. Con: CERN research has shown the assumptions behind positive cloud feedacks is also in error, [CERN CLOUD shows pre-industrial skies cloudier than we thought](https://youtu.be/8M3up6T9Zeg) This means the climate models have been over estimating warming.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Numerous studies \(including the CERN CLOUD research, itself\) have apparently now concluded that ionization from Galactic Cosmic Rays has [negligible influence on cloud formation](https://skepticalscience.com/cosmic-rays-and-global-warming-advanced.htm). GCR fluxes don't track measured changes in temperatures, nor do they explain other AGW phenomena that are well handled by GHG physics.
1.8.2. Con: It has certainly been observed that melting ice decreases the earth's albedo.
1.8.3. Con: Outgassing of CO2 from warming waters, a positive feedback, is governed by[Henry's Law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law) .
1.8.4. Con: Outgassing of methane from Arctic water and soil is observable. This is another positive feedback.
1.8.5. Con: [Cloud cover is reduced in warmer atmospheric temperatures,](http://greenerblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/cloud-cover-decreases-in-warming-planet.html)so that an increase of 0.9C causes a 14% reduction in cloud cover. If this relation is linear, a doubling of CO2 would give a 42% reduction of cloud cover. The clouds are also driven higher in a warmer atmosphere, and higher clouds have a more warming effect. Therefore clouds cannot be relied on as a negative feedback.
1.9. Pro: Natural causes of warming cannot explain the rapid increase in global mean temperatures in the 20th and 21st centuries.
1.9.1. Pro: Solar radiation has declined as global mean temperature has gone up.
1.9.1.1. Con: There is a measurable Hiatus in warming that corresponds to the decline in Solar radiation. [Who pressed the pause button?](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2014/03/06/who-pressed-the-pause-button) We are far from having the science of AGW settled.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: For a decade or so, it was possible to contrive a "hiatus" by choosing the high-point of the 1998 El Nino as a starting point. In that short time-span it was also possible to imagine a correlation with the 11-year solar cycle. As the linked article actually suggests, that correlation has fallen apart.
1.9.2. Con: That we can't explain it with what we know of natural causes doesn't prove it must all be 'man made'. It all remains uncertain until we can reliable predict.
1.9.2.1. Con: Straw man. No one claims that all recent changes are man made. We can only explain recent changes by including natural and man made inputs.
1.9.2.2. Con: "Since IPCC’s first report in 1990, assessed projections have suggested global average temperature increases between about 0.15°C and 0.3°C per decade for 1990 to 2005. This can now be compared with observed values of about 0.2°C per decade, strengthening confidence in near-term projections." [\(2007\)](https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-projections-of.html) "Estimated anthropogenic global warming is currently increasing at 0.2°C \(likely between 0.1°C and 0.3°C\) per decade due to past and ongoing emissions \(high confidence\)" [\(2018\)](http://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf)
1.9.2.3. Con: It's 'man made'. The increasing temperatures are well-explained by rising GHGs, and these are well-explained as the result of human activity.
1.9.3. Pro: [Only natural + man made factors can accurately match observed temperatures](http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/images/figspm-4.gif)
1.9.3.1. Pro: Cores extracted from sea beds and polar ice reveal a natural variation in atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the [Milankovitch cycles](https://www.universetoday.com/39012/milankovitch-cycle/). It varied regularly from 180 ppm \(Ige Age\) to 280 ppm \(Warm Phase\) over the last 8 cycles, or 800,000 years \([graph](https://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-lags-temperature-intermediate.htm)\). Recent measurements put atmospheric CO2 concentrations at [409](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/) ppm. This is nearly 50% higher than it has been in almost a million years, and no natural process can account for it. \(I'll find the links for this and add them\)
1.10. Pro: It is well established that the increases we have seen in CO2 levels since the industrial revolution are mainly due to human activity.
1.10.1. Con: While man is driving the increased CO2 levels, the correlation with temperature is poor. We saw significant warming pre WW2 when world was in recession, then climate cooling post WW2 till 70's when global Industrialization was rapid and CO2 output from man was significant. CO2 is a contributor but clearly not the main 'control knob' for temperature.
1.10.1.1. Con: [The correlation between temperature and CO2 levels since 1970 is good](http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/gistemp/from:1958/mean:13/plot/esrl-co2/normalise/offset:0.2). Temperature varies around he increasing trend of CO2 due to other inputs, i.e. Solar, ocean heat, aerosols and volcanoes
1.10.2. Pro: In 2017 the single year global CO2 output due to the burning of fossil fuels was [32.5](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-carbon-iea/global-carbon-emissions-hit-record-high-in-2017-idUSKBN1GY0RB) Billion Tonnes. If all of that gas was spread out over the contiguous United States, it would create a blanket of gas over the country about 7' high
1.10.2.1. Con: That gas was not dispersed in such a way, much of it is absorbed by different ecological niches. A more useful number would be the predicted tonnage actually to reach the ozone layer.
1.11. Pro: You can look at any scientific theory and say it's not been fully established, keep an open mind etc. The difference with this is that if we don't act immediately and make some drastic changes, we may be inflicting irreversible damage. The stakes here are so much higher than with any scientific theory before -they are global and transcend humanity. That's the difference. That's why immediate realisation and cooperation is necessary. I really hope we can get there soon. Seems not.
1.11.1. Con: The rule for high stakes games is to avoid drastic measures unless absolutely necessary. To take slow and careful action and seek consensus. If we overshoot an attempt to alter our climate, it could be worse than the current dilemna
1.11.1.1. Con: "If we overshoot ..." This is presumably saying that if we reduce CO2 levels too quickly, plant growth will suffer. In fact, if we decarbonise out economy at maximum rate, CO2 levels will still be above 280ppm for centuries. Plenty of time to make sure that we are not doing any harm.
1.11.2. Pro: About half of Americans still reject evolution, a theory which is now considered a [fact](http://www.nas.edu/evolution/TheoryOrFact.html) in the scientific community. Even so, we are still learning more and refining our knowledge. We don't know everything, but we know we have the basics right. If people choose not to believe it, it's not detrimental to the whole human race in the long run.
1.11.2.1. Con: It matters how it is presented. Virtually all do agree with the underlying mechanisms of evolution: mutation, migration \(gene flow\), genetic drift, and natural selection They don't reject the science outright.
1.11.3. Pro: It seems a perfect fit for the old adage, "better safe than sorry."
1.11.4. Pro: Unfortunately, there is a built in positive feedback loop when CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere. The oceans are the main component of the natural CO2 cycle, and as the water warms, it begins to [release](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20413-warmer-oceans-release-co2-faster-than-thought/) more than it absorbs. Thus CO2 makes it warmer, which in turn releases more CO2, which makes it warmer, etc. We could reach a tipping point where the whole thing starts to run away, and time may be shorter than we realize.
1.11.4.1. Pro: There are multiple positive feedback loops in play. [A recent study](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/07/31/1810141115) used the term ["hothouse earth"](https://phys.org/news/2018-08-earth-hothouse-state.html) to describe how a combination of ten different non-linear feedback mechanisms could "tip" the climate into a new regime that will tend to escalate temperatures far outside the historical interglacial bounds.
1.11.4.2. Con: There are also many negative feedback loops effecting the same systems
1.12. Con: Science is never certain. It requires one to keep an open mind to the possibility of error.
1.12.1. Con: Keeping an open mind is useful because that way you can come to correct conclusions. But if you never come to those conclusions and pretend like it's an open question even in the face of overwhelming evidence, there is no point in it.
1.12.2. Con: Science requires testable hypotheses that are supported or refuted by experiment. The current state of climate science is a result of that process, including numerous "skeptical" hypotheses that have failed. It has become increasingly difficult to imagine new skeptical challenges that also fit the existing data.
1.12.3. Con: The possibility of error cuts both ways. If man-made climate change "sceptics" are wrong, they are causing damage to our future and that of our descendants. If decarbonisers are wrong, we will be reducing air pollution and traffic congestion, reducing the sharpness of transition as we run out of finite fuels, and providing developed countries with access to solar energy.
1.12.4. Con: Paradoxically, because science develops by testing all hypotheses in an attempt to falsify them, it gives us the most certainty of all intellectual disciplines.
1.12.5. Pro: There is an extremely small percentage chance climate change's findings are not settled, as any other scientific claim would be.
1.12.5.1. Con: This chance is unlikely due to the [overwhelming evidence climate change is real](https://www.popsci.com/evidence-climate-change-is-real#page-5).
1.12.5.2. Con: The percentage is so small that it is not worth taking in account.
1.12.6. Con: Nothing in this life - except death and taxes - is 100% certain. It is possible to find uncertainty and to ask questions seeking more information about everything. Some people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder spend a large part of their daily life trying to be certain that their hands are washed clean of dirt. Therefore it is irrational to demand 100% certainty of climate science.
1.12.7. Pro: The science of human-induced climate change is based on a consensus of scientific opinion rather than the standards of the scientific method. This is a clear indication from a scientific point of view this is far from settled. Consensus of scientific opinion is what placed Galileo in prison for so many years. Consensus, at best, should encourage a much more robust and vigorous study of the phenomenon, but we should not be fooled into believing that we have a true understanding.
1.12.7.1. Con: My argument here is that a determination of "scientific consensus" indicates a lack of proof to move from consensus to fact. Currently we are at a "consensus" stage on the climate change induced by humans argument that does not allow us yet to establish clear, concise facts. Consensus is good enough to provide for our further study, but not good enough to determine radical changes to our global economies and societal structures. We need to act on climate change, but to also avoid over-reacting.
1.12.7.2. Con: The standards of the scientific method have resulted in multiple lines of evidence and hypothesis which are consistent and mutually supporting. The scientific community has found this overwhelming evidence to be persuasive. The consensus follows from that.
1.12.7.3. Con: This is an extraordinary argument. It implies that consensus actually is a cause of doubt; from which it would follow that the less support an idea has in the scientific community, the more likely it is to be true.
1.12.7.3.1. Con: That is what is referred to as the bandwagon fallacy, or the appeal to authority fallacy. Science itself is based on doubt and careful measurement. There is a distinct difference between opinion which is lent to aconsensus, and a scientifically disprovable theory or theoretical model which can be measured and tested.
1.12.7.4. Con: The "standards of the scientific method" - the core science itself - are laid out [here](https://www.kialo.com/the-science-of-human-induced-climate-change-is-largely-settled-18139/18139.0=18139.1+18139.34)
1.12.7.5. Con: The consensus that put Galileo in prison was not scientific, it was theological.
1.12.7.5.1. Con: Since the politics of climate change are ideological and dogmatic, the effect is much the same
1.12.7.6. Con: One does not need to take the scientist's word for it. The great thing about science is that articles about the various aspects of the theory get published and peer reviewed. To accept the science, one only needs to learn about it directly. When we look at the evidence presented, we don't need to rely on anyone else's opinion.
1.12.7.7. Con: There is a great deal of misinformation out there. Some skepticism is a good thing, but it should applied equally to the the information out there that attacks the theory, such as the idea that "it's too complicated for us to understand it." We have deep knowledge of atomic structure, they are very complex, and we can't even see them. We landed two robots on Mars, so we can understand very complicated problems.
1.12.7.8. Con: The field of climate science is now over 150 years old. There's an article in a 1912 [newspaper](https://www.iflscience.com/environment/theres-more-to-that-1912-news-article-linking-coal-to-climate-change-than-you-think/) that shows the fundamentals were known then. Scientists aren't wetting their finger and holding up to the breeze. We've been studying sea floor core samples, ice core samples, solar cycles, the effects of volcanic eruptions, what happened with CFCs and the ozone layer, and we've built satellites that are up in orbit studying the atmosphere today. This is all actual science being conducted.
1.12.8. Con: While all knowledge may be tentative, there are numerous scientific theories that are as near certain as is possible, for example: [heliocentricity](https://www.britannica.com/science/heliocentric-system), [evolution](http://www.nas.edu/evolution/TheoryOrFact.html), [cell theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cell-theory), [germ theory](https://www.britannica.com/science/germ-theory), [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory)... There are many more. It would seem a little strange to be keeping an open mind about whether the earth orbits the sun or whether our bodies are made up of cells.
1.12.9. Con: We make decisions every day based on uncertain information. In fact, we navigate our entire lives without ever being 100% positive about anything. Knowledge is probabilistic, and maybe that's the best we're ever going to do. Since 100% is not possible, we must ask ourselves how much assurance do we need to act on climate science. 90%? 95%? 98%? Would the calculation change if someone has children or grandchildren?
1.13. Pro: The mechanism of the "greenhouse effect" is largely not disputed. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases absorb more infrared light than other gaseous compounds in the atmosphere.[Howglobalwarmingworks.org](http://Howglobalwarmingworks.org)
1.13.1. Con: Increased 'radiative forcing' from higher GHG levels is not disputed. However, there is scientific disagreement on the additional "forcing" from feedbacks. Since most of the projected warming is due to "forcing", it remains an important area to be researched.[Climate Change: Where theorists and skeptics agree and disagree](https://www.commdiginews.com/health-science/climate-change-where-theorists-and-skeptics-agree-and-disagree-18567/)
1.13.2. Pro: Discovered in 1856 by [Eunice Foote](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lady-scientist-helped-revolutionize-climate-science-didnt-get-credit-180961291/). She left jars of different gasses in the sun. The CO2 was warmer than the others, and stayed warmer longer. CO2 absorbs heat.
1.13.2.1. Con: The direct warming from CO2 \(radiative forcing\) is +1C with doubling, [this is settled science between the IPCC and skeptics](https://judithcurry.com/2010/12/11/co2-no-feedback-sensitivity/). The additional projected warming of +1 to +3C from feedbacks is where the science is not settled.
1.14. Con: The chain of reasoning between human activity and global warming has not been fully established.
1.14.1. Con: The chain is this \(1\) the Greenhouse Effect is real \(2\) CO2 is a Greenhouse Gas, the second most powerful after H2O vapour \(3\) we have already increased CO2 levels in air by more than 40%. All of these points are well established.
1.14.1.1. Con: The 'feedbacks' from higher CO2 are not well established, if fact they are very poorly understood and they account for the majority of projected warming in the models.
1.14.1.1.1. Con: Positive feedbacks are: increased water vapour in atmosphere, less cloud cooling effect, increased outgassing of CO2 from warming waters, CO2 from increasing forest fires, less albedo from polar ice and glaciers and methane release from permafrost.
1.14.1.1.2. Con: Negative feedbacks are: increased CO2 uptake in some regions from a putative CO2 fertilisation effect, and the Stefan-Boltzmann effect as a warming Earth radiates more IR into space.
1.14.1.1.3. Con: The result of combining positive and negative feedbacks from a doubling of CO2 levels is termed Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity \(ECS\), and has been studied intensively from a number of different angles. The[IPCC 2007](https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-6-4-2.html) report gave ECS as likely to be between 2-4.5C, with 3C being the most likely.
1.14.2. Pro: Natural causes of warming could provide an alternative explanation.
1.14.2.1. Con: We cannot account for recent warming without including changes we have made to the greenhouse effect. [www.ipcc.ch](http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/images/figspm-4.gif)
1.14.2.2. Con: There is a 100,000 year natural climate swing from Ice Age to Warm Period called the [Milankovitch Cycle](https://www.universetoday.com/39012/milankovitch-cycle/). It is caused by Earth's axis tilt, axis precession, and orbital skewing when Earth is in near synchronous orbit with Jupiter. The jovian planet pulls on Earth and elongates its orbit. The current state of these aspects indicate that the Earth should, in fact, be [cooling](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GISSTemperature/giss_temperature2.php). The fact that we are warming instead is very significant.
1.14.3. Pro: Correlation does not prove causation. Just because global temperatures are going up does not mean that human beings are the cause.
1.14.3.1. Con: Nothing but causation can account for this particular correlation. There would have to be something else that causes both climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. There can be no such thing.
1.14.3.2. Con: Climatologists are well aware that correlation is not causation. They have studied all aspects of the problem in every way possible, and cannot explain the observed global warming without factoring in the GHG changes that we have brought about.
1.15. Pro: There is a "scientific consensus" around human-induced climate change, with more than 90% of climate scientists ascribing changes in Earth's climate to human causes.
1.15.1. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.15.2. Con: These surveys are highly flawed in how the results were represented. With proper reading of the surveys, they show a majority of scientists support their claims but it's definitely not near a 97% consensus. [Fact Checking The Claim Of 97% Consensus On Anthropogenic Climate Change](https://www.forbes.com/sites/uhenergy/2016/12/14/fact-checking-the-97-consensus-on-anthropogenic-climate-change/#37208b081157) There are valid disagreements that should be explored rather than 'shut-down' through false claims of full consensus.
1.15.3. Pro: There are approximately 150 international scientific [agencies](http://www.opr.ca.gov/facts/list-of-scientific-organizations.html) that put out statements agreeing to 1\) Climate change is real, and 2\) Human are the predominant cause.
