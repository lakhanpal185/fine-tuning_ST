Discussion Title: What Is the Best Drug Regulation System?

1. What is the best drug regulation system?
1.1. Prohibit consumption of all drugs including alcohol and nicotine.
1.1.1. Pro: All drugs, including alcohol and nicotine, cause harm to the body.
1.1.1.1. Con: Applying high taxes to legal drugs \(like alcohol and nicotine\) has proven [effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735171/) in reducing consumption and related negative effects. This may be more efficient than prohibition.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Prohibition [tends to create illegal markets](https://iea.org.uk/blog/prohibitions-create-black-markets-and-cause-violent-crime) which, once established, are harder to fight.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In this case, prohibition without raising awareness can lead to worse results.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no reason why prohibition wouldn't be accompanied by awareness campaigns.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: If taxes are so high that affording drugs becomes difficult for a substantial number of people, a black market in drugs will likely arise.
1.1.1.2. Con: Many substances cause harm to the body when consumed improperly \(including [fast food](http://www.healthline.com/health/fast-food-effects-on-body) and [sugar](http://uk.businessinsider.com/effects-of-sugar-on-your-body-and-brain-2016-10?r=US&IR=T)\), but this is not a reason to ban them.
1.1.1.3. Con: [Ecstasy](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/mar/23/constitution.drugsandalcohol) \(MDMA\) is regarded as relatively safe and harmless by scientists.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: These studies apply to pure drugs and are therefore not applicable to the drugs regular drug addicts are taking as most street drugs [do not have](http://www.drugwise.org.uk/how-pure-are-street-drugs/) a purity beyond 5-10%.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: By taking pure MDMA \(crystalline powder\) drug users can [avoid](http://sunrisehouse.com/club-drugs/molly/) the negative effects that come with taking ecstasy pills based on MDMA \(which are regularly laced with impurities\).
1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Pure drugs will likely become more widely available in a legal market where drugs can easily be tested.
1.1.1.4. Con: Consenting adults should be able to self-determine their lives. If they want to take drugs, even after they know all the risks and consequences, it is their right to do so.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Most people already know about the dangers of hard drugs so it is possible to evaluate their consent.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Anti-drug campaigns by both government and independent agencies are widespread and have an educating effect.
1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The "Ice destroys lives" campaign by the Australian Government turned [half](http://www.news.com.au/national/federal-governments-ice-advertisements-turn-half-our-at-risk-kids-off-the-drug/news-story/ff26fe90d9d82c59ceacd00bface56ad) of at-risk children away from the drug.
1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The confrontational nature of this campaign may have a [negative effect](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/shock-and-awe-ice-campaigns-a-turn-off-research-20150522-gh7as2.html) on children.
1.1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Anti-drug campaigns can have [counter-intuitive effects](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-03/science-psas-do-anti-drug-ads-keep-kids-drugs) as some kids will get curious what doing drugs would be like, even if they had never had that curiosity before.
1.1.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: The likelihood of a child only ever encountering the topic of drugs in an anti-drug campaign is very low as they will most likely eventually be exposed to them in real-world settings. The negative context of the anti-drug campaign is likely to have a more deterrent effect than the real-world encounter which can be affected by social-pressure.
1.1.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Campaigns, such as [Talk to Frank](http://www.talktofrank.com/), are informing children about the negative effects of drugs.
1.1.1.4.1.1.4. Pro: The campaign [Above the Influence](http://abovetheinfluence.com/) was found to be [effective](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-03/science-psas-do-anti-drug-ads-keep-kids-drugs) as only 8% of teenagers who were familiar with the campaign started smoking pot, versus 12% of teenagers who had not seen it.
1.1.1.4.1.1.5. Con: Anti-drug campaigns often fall back on scare tactics rather than education, such as the [DrugsNot4Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsTUHCOyVvE) campaign.
1.1.1.4.1.1.5.1. Con: Basing legislation decisions on the fact that anti-drug campaigns in the past were executed poorly seems weird. The quality and nature of anti-drug campaigns are not related to the actual legal problem at all.
1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: There are many types of drugs outside [standard categories](https://www.unodc.org/drugs/en/get-the-facts/types-of-drugs.html), such as crocodile, PCP, or N-Bomb. This makes appropriate knowledge of drugs difficult.
1.1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: As the drugs would be decriminalised and high taxes introduced, the legally sold drugs would be well-known and regulated. Illegally sold or newly discovered drugs don't really fit the scope of the debate which - by talking about taxation -assumes legal trade. Illegal trade of goods and tax avoidance is a completely different issue.
1.1.1.4.2. Con: Drugs and drug addiction have hugely damaging [social effects](http://www.medic8.com/drug-addiction/social-effects.html).
1.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Many people become violent when under the influence of drugs.
1.1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: [Several](http://www.narconon.org/blog/drug-addiction/the-most-common-drugs-that-make-a-person-aggressive-or-angry/) common drugs are known to induce anger and aggression.
1.1.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: [Cocaine](http://www.livestrong.com/article/167075-what-drugs-cause-aggressive-behavior/) and [PCP](https://www.foundationsrecoverynetwork.com/can-drugs-make-people-violent/) have both been linked to increases in violent behaviour.
1.1.1.4.2.1.3. Pro: Although marijuana makes people relaxed in the short term, continued use can cause anxiety and paranoia, which can result in [violent outbursts](http://learnaboutmarijuanawa.org/factsheets/aggression.htm).
1.1.1.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: Those who experience continued exposure to cannabis are at a higher risk to become [violent offenders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26961342) over the course of their lives.
1.1.1.4.2.1.3.2. Pro: Marijuana use hampers cognitive function that can lead to an increase in violence in conflict situations.
1.1.1.4.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Marijuana reduces the threshold that inhibits inappropriate responses \([Ostrowsky, p. 370](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2190/DE.41.4.c)\).
1.1.1.4.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: Marijuana consumption may cause premature conflict escalation \([Ostrowsky, p. 370](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2190/DE.41.4.c)\).
1.1.1.4.2.1.3.3. Con: Animal testing suggests that there is no link between marijuana use and non-intimate violence. In fact, aggression was reduced across the board \([Moore & Stuart, p. 176](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178903000867)\).
1.1.1.4.2.1.3.4. Pro: Marijuana users are slightly more likely to be violent toward their wives than non-users \([Moore & Stuart, p. 178](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178903000867)\).
1.1.1.4.2.1.3.5. Con: The vast majority of users note a positive mood when consuming marijuana \([Ostrowsky, p. 372](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2190/DE.41.4.c)\).
1.1.1.4.2.1.3.6. Con: Smoking marijuana reportedly makes users more tolerant and open to different lifestyles \([Ostrowsky, p. 372](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2190/DE.41.4.c)\).
1.1.1.4.2.1.3.7. Con: [A psychiatric study](http://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2016/02/18/Study-Marijuana-doesn-t-cause-anxiety-depression/stories/201602180095) found no evidence that marijuana consumption causes anxiety or depression in adults.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4. Con: Alcohol [can make you violent](http://www.abc.net.au/health/thepulse/stories/2014/01/30/3934877.htm), yet it is not banned.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.1. Con: Although alcohol can also get you to a point where you are more violent, it requires more alcohol to reach this point and it is therefore less dangerous.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Many people who drink also tend to frequently binge drink.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Among those underage people who drink in the US, [most](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm) have binge drunk at some point.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: One in six US adults binge drinks [four](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm) times per month.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: This is precisely why alcohol is just as risky as drugs: the frequency of binge drinking puts far more people at risk of violence than drugs.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.2. Con: This is a reason to ban alcohol as well, not legalise drugs.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.3. Pro: [Alcohol](https://theconversation.com/alcohol-leads-to-more-violence-than-other-drugs-but-youd-never-know-from-the-headlines-72281) is responsible for more violence and harm than any other drug.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: Unlike other drugs, [alcohol](http://theconversation.com/alcohol-leads-to-more-violence-than-other-drugs-but-youd-never-know-from-the-headlines-72281) negatively influences the function of the pre-frontal cortex; this part of the brain regulates social interaction and behaviour. As a result, primed individuals tend to make poor decisions and generally act more emotionally and unreasonably.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.3.2. Pro: [A study](http://aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/tandi_pdf/tandi372.pdf) came to the conclusion that alcohol consumption was involved in 47% of homicides in Australia in a six-year period.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.3.3. Con: This can be explained by the [widespread](https://theconversation.com/alcohol-leads-to-more-violence-than-other-drugs-but-youd-never-know-from-the-headlines-72281) availability and use of alcohol, as well as its legal status.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.3.4. Pro: Research suggests that [two-thirds](https://www.verywell.com/domestic-abuse-and-alcohol-62643) of incidents of domestic violence happen while the perpetrator is under the influence of alcohol.
1.1.1.4.2.1.4.3.4.1. Con: The source also argues that there is not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship between alcohol and domestic violence. In fact, some experts suggest that abusers [use alcohol as an excuse](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/svaw/domestic/link/alcohol.htm) for their actions.
1.1.1.4.2.2. Con: The same can be said about alcohol addiction or gambling.
1.1.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Alcohol and tobacco induced illnesses cost society billions of dollars per year.
1.1.1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: This means that the decision to take these is not simply a personal one, but one that affects everybody in society.
1.1.1.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Every decision a person can make has an effect on society and on those around them. This does not give society the right to arbitrarily enforce restrictions on practices that are no more harmful than unhealthy food or extreme sports.
1.1.1.4.2.2.1.2. Pro: [Second-hand smoking](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/health_effects/) is potentially more harmful to society than hard drug use induced violence. However, tobacco remains a legal drug.
1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3. Con: The widespread existence of anti-tobacco campaigns, e.g.[in the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/ex_smokers_are_unstoppable_en), clearly shows that society is working to reduce those costs.
1.1.1.4.2.2.1.3.1. Con: The legalisation of drugs would not stop society from running anti-drug campaigns to minimise their use.
1.1.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.4.
1.1.1.4.2.2.3. Pro: Gambling addiction can [devastate](http://www.lawyerment.com/library/articles/Self_Improvement/Addictions/1975.htm) your family.
1.1.1.4.2.2.4. Pro: Alcoholism [destroys families](http://www.michaelshouse.com/alcohol-addiction/how-it-destroys-the-family/) and deeply affects loved ones.
1.1.1.4.2.2.5. Pro: Only heroin has a higher social harm score than alcohol and even then these are almost the same \([Taylor et al., p. 3](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/4/e000774)\).
1.1.1.4.2.2.6. Con: This is a reason to criminalise or curtail the use of alcohol and gambling, not a justification to legalise drugs.
1.1.1.4.2.2.6.1. Con: Prohibition of alcohol would evoke the same negative effects as the current drug policy.
1.1.1.4.2.2.6.1.1. Pro: Creation of black markets will lead an increase in price, motivating criminals to participate in the trade. With no legal option to settle disputes altercations are often settled at gunpoint.
1.1.1.4.2.3. Con: Drugs harm no-one besides the person taking them. It is therefore illegitimate for the state to restrict drug use because individuals should be allowed to make that decision themselves.
1.1.1.4.2.3.1. Con: The problem with drug users is that they often harm not only themselves, but also their loved ones, dependants, friends and society at large.
1.1.1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.
1.1.1.4.2.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.1.1.1.
1.1.1.4.2.3.1.3. Pro: This can occur by [stealing](https://www.ncadd.org/about-addiction/alcohol-drugs-and-crime) from others to support a drug habit.
1.1.1.4.2.3.1.4. Pro: Drug addicts give birth to [drug-dependent babies](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36703939), who must then suffer through [Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_withdrawal).
1.1.1.4.2.3.1.5. Pro: Often, drug users hurt others while under the influence.
1.1.1.4.2.3.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.2.
1.1.1.4.2.3.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.1.
1.1.1.4.2.3.1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.4.
1.1.1.4.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.3.1.
1.1.1.4.2.5. Pro: Society should not have to pay for irresponsible self-harming behaviour.
1.1.1.4.2.5.1. Pro: Substance abuse costs the US government [$600 billion](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/frequently-asked-questions/drug-addiction-treatment-worth-its-cost) a year.
1.1.1.4.2.5.1.1. Con: The amount includes prosecution and imprisonment - extremely costly factors that would cease to exist with legal drugs.
1.1.1.4.2.5.2. Con: The same argument could be applied to extreme sports that have high rates of costly accidents and yet they are legal.
1.1.1.4.2.5.3. Con: Society does not have to pick up the bill; we should simply allow people to live how they want and accept the consequences for their own actions.
1.1.1.4.2.5.3.1. Con: A society could also say that it does not want to be confronted with the results of people abusing drugs.
1.1.1.4.2.5.4. Con: There is already a norm of society paying for the outcomes of other people's choices; the health problems caused by other irresponsible behaviours such as unhealthy nourishment cost society [billions](http://pressemitteilungen.pr.uni-halle.de/index.php?modus=pmanzeige&pm_id=2452).
1.1.1.4.2.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.1.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: Under the influence of drugs, people can forget relevant information and become unable to consent to their continued use of that drug.
1.1.1.4.3.1. Con: People need to be aware of the information when they make the decision to consume drugs, not while they are intoxicated.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1. Con: This is not the standard level of consent accepted by society; continual consent is required for an activity.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: For example, even though an individual may initially consent to having sex, they retain the right to revoke that consent during the sex.
1.1.1.4.3.2. Pro: [Ecstasy users](http://drugabuse.com/library/the-effects-of-ecstasy-use/) often consume more than the recommended dose once they are 'high' in order to avoid a 'comedown'.
1.1.1.4.4. Con: A person cannot meaningfully consent to drug use.
1.1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Many people turn to drugs because of trauma or unhappiness in their lives, which can mean they perceive themselves as having no other alternative. This is usually false, meaning they do not consent to that drug use.
1.1.1.4.4.1.1. Con: In fact, the [majority](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/habits-most-drug-users-are-happy-successful-people-with-a-taste-for-the-good-life-1292155.html) of young individuals consuming illegal substances lead fulfilling and successful lives.
1.1.1.4.4.1.2. Con: Most [drug users](http://theconversation.com/many-people-use-drugs-but-heres-why-most-dont-become-addicts-35504) can rely on supportive networks and loving families.
1.1.1.4.4.1.3. Pro: The '[Rat Park](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130910-drug-addiction-the-complex-truth)' experiment found that quality of life and living conditions have a huge influence on one's susceptibility to addiction.
1.1.1.4.4.1.4. Pro: There is a high level of correlation between [poverty](https://borgenproject.org/addiction-poverty-connected/) and substance abuse.
1.1.1.4.4.1.5. Con: Insofar as this is true, if drugs genuinely enhance their existence, that can be a legitimate choice.
1.1.1.4.4.2. Pro: Addiction [inhibits free choice](https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2015/06/addiction-disease-free-will).
1.1.1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Although addiction does not remove choice completely, it makes saying no to drugs [extremely difficult](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/addicted-brains/201208/addiction-matter-choice).
1.1.1.4.4.2.2. Con: Recent research has shown that addicts [can rationally choose](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/the-science-of-choice-in-addiction/280080/).
1.1.1.4.4.2.3. Pro: Between [40% and 60%](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/treatment-recovery) of recovered drug addicts will relapse.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4. Pro: Hard drugs are extremely addictive, but it is difficult to comprehend the extent of this before one has become addicted.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.1. Pro: It is impossible to tell whether you have a predisposition for addiction.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.1.1. Con: [Research](http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/genes/) suggests that substance addiction is genetically influenced and thus can be passed within families.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.2. Con: Other drugs, such as alcohol and tobacco, are equally addictive, but are legal.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.3. Con: Addiction is a widely known side-effect of many drugs. It is a risk people can consider before engaging.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.3.1. Con: [Cognitive dissonance](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/science-choice/201610/cognitive-dissonance-and-addiction) affects the decision to take drugs. No-one taking drugs for the first or even the tenth time really believes that they will become addicted, despite the overwhelming risk.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.4. Pro: Heroin and cocaine are the [most addictive substances](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/the-5-most-addictive-drugs-in-the-world-a6924746.html) in the world. The risk of addiction is much greater for these than for other addictive substances, such as coffee or alcohol.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.4.1. Con: Even [heroin](http://archive.samhsa.gov/data/2k8/newUseDepend/newUseDepend.htm), regarded as one of the most dangerous and addictive drugs, caused merely 13% of first-time users to develop an addiction within the first year.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.4.2. Con: According to the [parent's source](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/the-5-most-addictive-drugs-in-the-world-a6924746.html) nicotine and alcohol are almost equally addictive and directly follow heroin and cocaine in the ranking. Therefore, the addictive characteristic cannot be an argument in regard to the legal status of a substance, as the vast majority of illegal drugs are less addictive than the legal ones.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.2.3.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.6. Con: Addiction is a possible but unlikely outcome of drug consumption.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.6.1. Pro: Fewer than 10% of [first-time drug users](http://archive.samhsa.gov/data/2k8/newUseDepend/newUseDepend.htm) develop an addiction within the first year; the majority do not consume the drug anymore after one year.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.6.1.1. Con: Even if only one in ten drug users become addicted, this is enough reason to ban drugs given the massive harms of addiction.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.6.1.1.1. Con: It is highly unfair to prohibit drugs generally, just because a few cannot handle them.
1.1.1.4.4.2.4.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.2.4.4.1.
1.1.1.4.4.2.5. Con: Individuals make a choice to start taking drugs in the first place, free of physical addiction, and in many cases do so knowing about the risk of becoming addicted.
1.1.1.4.4.2.6. Pro: Addiction is so debilitating to choice that some addicts [forget](https://www.marrinc.org/legacy-parental-addiction/) to take care of their children.
1.1.1.4.4.3. Pro: Given the variety of impacts that drug consumption can have on an individual, it is unlikely that they would understand all the outcomes that it could have.
1.1.1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Users are unlikely to understand the unique ways in which different drugs react in their body.
1.1.1.4.4.3.2. Con: Presumably once drug use becomes legal, more of this information will be known and freely available so people can inform themselves.
1.1.1.4.4.3.2.1. Pro: Legalising drug use allows for more governmental regulation, such as packaging drugs with warnings and information about what one is taking.
1.1.1.4.4.3.2.2. Con: The [NIDA](https://www.drugabuse.gov/) already freely provides drug abuse related information.
1.1.1.4.4.3.3. Con: Much of the variance in impacts can be put down to the varying [composition](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/10/ecstasy-molly-purity-us-synthetic-drugs-mdma) and [potency](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/28/clubbers-warn-overdose-risk-from-superstrength-ecstasy-mdma) of drugs that are produced illegally.
1.1.1.4.4.3.3.1. Pro: The purity level of cocaine can range from [10% to 90%](http://www.unodc.org/pdf/WDR_2005/volume_2_chap7_cocaine.pdf), with little way of determining the purity of street-bought cocaine.
1.1.1.4.4.3.3.2. Pro: [Heroin](http://www.recoveryplace.com/blog/the-danger-of-impure-street-drugs/) averages approximately 45% to 50% purity. The rest usually contains paracetamol, other opiate alkaloids, sugars, and in some cases methaqualone or diazepam. Fatal overdoses are also attributed to the varying purity of heroin.
1.1.1.4.4.3.4. Pro: Drug responses vary with the person taking them. For example, different [ethnicities](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/ScienceResearch/.../UCM085502.pdf) react differently. This makes drug use and its consequences extremely complex.
1.1.1.4.4.3.5. Pro: The dosage of the same drug can affect individuals to greatly varying degrees.
1.1.1.4.4.3.5.1. Pro: A dose that makes one person high could put someone else in a catatonic state.
1.1.1.4.4.3.5.2. Con: Dosages would be more standardised and users more informed about dosage strengths under a legal market.
1.1.1.4.4.4. Con: It is not the role of the government to protect people from making poor choices, only to guarantee that people comprehend the risks involved in the behaviors they are choosing.
1.1.1.4.4.4.1. Pro: Consent can be protected through education and awareness campaigns.
1.1.1.4.4.4.1.1. Pro: It's possible that the level of education required for informed consent regarding recreational drugs is an M.D. in pharmacology. This is why governments generally require a doctor to prescribe drugs. Clearly the prevailing view is that an M.D. is the required level of education.
1.1.1.4.4.4.2. Con: Governments try to protect people from making a variety of poor choices, for example with [seat belt laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt_legislation) and [sugar taxes](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/oct/11/world-health-organisation-who-countries-tax-sugary-drinks).
1.1.1.4.4.4.3. Con: If you accept the premise of the parent claim, "a person cannot meaningfully consent to drug use" then governments cannot guarantee people comprehend the risks involved therefore government must prevent the behavior.
1.1.1.4.4.5. Con: The risks of drugs are widely known and taught. People are capable of weighing that up against the benefit they may gain.
1.1.1.4.4.6. Con: [A 2006 paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16680876/) claims that heroin adicts are able to consent to medical prescription of heroin.
1.1.1.4.5. Con: Just because adults are the only ones who are allowed to buy drugs does not prevent them passing it onto others who are not, such as children.
1.1.1.4.5.1. Pro: This is the same with alcohol. Despite strict laws around the purchasing of alcohol for minors in many countries, a [large](https://responsibility.org/get-the-facts/research/statistics/underage-drinking-statistics/) percentage of them still consume it.
1.1.1.4.5.1.1. Con: This is precisely why it is inconsistent and illegitimate to criminalise drugs and not alcohol.
1.1.1.4.5.2. Con: The legalisation of drugs would not preclude the government from banning distribution to those under the age of consent, as is done with alcohol.
1.1.1.4.5.3. Con: This can happen in the status quo as well, where adults can illegally buy drugs and pass them onto minors.
1.1.1.4.5.3.1. Con: It is easier for adults to get drugs. This changes the status quo and makes it more likely that they pass them onto minors.
1.1.1.5. Con: Nicotine is a very safe drug below its lethal dose. Harm is relative amount consumed.
1.1.1.6. Con: So does a sedentary lifestyle. Should we ban sitting for longer than an hour a day? Just because something is potentially harmful doesn't mean that everyone who does it needs to be rounded up and thrown in prison \(which would cause more harm to the body than many of the drugs currently prohibited\).
1.1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.4.3.1.
1.1.1.8. Con: High voltage electricity causes immediate death yet we do not impose a prohibition with severe punishments on using it.
1.1.1.9. Pro: Alcohol and tobacco are [responsible](http://drugfree.org/learn/drug-and-alcohol-news/who-report-smoking-and-drinking-cause-millions-of-deaths-worldwide/) for millions of deaths every year.
1.1.1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.1.
1.1.1.9.2. Pro: In the US, there were [3.2 alcohol fuelled driving deaths](https://responsibility.org/get-the-facts/research/statistics/drunk-driving-fatalities/) per 100,000 population in 2015, which represents more than 10,000 deaths.
1.1.1.9.2.1. Con: This can be addressed by [awareness raising campaigns](https://www.thecommunityguide.org/sites/default/files/assets/massmedia_AJPM1.pdf). Prohibition is not necessarily a more effective solution.
1.1.1.9.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.9.2.1.2. Con: These statistics come from a country where there are already a multitude of these awareness campaigns in existence. Even if these campaigns are effective to some extent, they clearly don't solve the problem altogether.
1.1.1.9.2.2. Pro: [One in five](http://healthland.time.com/2010/08/27/one-in-five-americans-admits-to-drinking-and-driving/) Americans admits to drunk driving at least once.
1.1.1.9.2.3. Con: The fact that some alcohol users drink irresponsibly or drive drunk does not justify banning alcohol. The same can be said for drugs.
1.1.2. Con: In the US, Prohibition in the 1920s was a [failure](http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa157.pdf). There is no indication it would be successful this time.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Although consumption of alcohol [fell](http://www.nber.org/papers/w3675) at the beginning of Prohibition, it subsequently increased.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: The subsequent increase was only to [around 70%](http://www.nber.org/papers/w3675) of the level immediately prior to Prohibition.
1.1.2.2. Pro: With Prohibition, alcohol became more [dangerous](http://time.com/3665643/deadly-drinking/) to consume.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Prohibition removed a significant source of tax revenue and greatly increased [government spending](https://www.futuresofpalmbeach.com/addiction-research/history-impact-prohibition-america/).
1.1.2.4. Pro: The growth of the illegal liquor trade under Prohibition made criminals of millions of Americans.
1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.4. Con: Most countries receive illegal drug traffic from other countries. Prohibition requires coordinated actions with these other countries to be successful, making it all the more difficult.
1.1.4.1. Pro: A single legal market in one country does not affect the organized crime's revenue significantly. A supranational project is required to successfully beat down organized crime.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: [Cartels](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/mexico-cartels-connections-abroad/) do business and transactions globally.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: An unilateral legal drug market actually benefits drug cartels as it allows them to conveniently trade their drugs.
1.1.5. Con: Prohibition of drugs is immensely costly; legalisation would benefit the economy.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Assuming that the legalisation of drugs is not adopted everywhere, the places that do legalise it [benefit](http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/09/marijuana-has-huge-influence-on-colorado-tourism-state-survey-says-2/) from drug tourism.
1.1.5.2. Con: If prohibition is the most effective in reducing the drug-related issues in society, then the cost should not be a prohibitive factor.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: A cost-benefit analysis is standard procedure in policy decisions.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Legalization means significantly reduced public spending or even increased public revenue: this could either lead to tax cuts or other forms of economic promotion.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Costs for legal proceedings would be eliminated if drug users were not held legally accountable. This would allow governments to spend that money elsewhere.
1.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Costs for court processing in New Mexico account for nearly [$8 million](http://www.drugpolicy.org/docUploads/costs_brochure.pdf) per year.
1.1.5.3.2. Pro: The cost of drug-related incarcerations is very high.
1.1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Incarcerated prisoners do not pay taxes. In New Mexico this accounts to an annual loss of [$1.5 million](http://www.drugpolicy.org/docUploads/costs_brochure.pdf).
1.1.5.3.2.2. Pro: In the US the average cost of incarceration for each federal inmate in the fiscal year 2014 was [around $30,000](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/03/09/2015-05437/annual-determination-of-average-cost-of-incarceration).
1.1.5.3.2.3. Pro: About one quarter of American inmates are non-violent drug offenders \([Schmitt et al., p. 3](http://cepr.net/documents/publications/incarceration-2010-06.pdf)\).
1.1.5.3.2.4. Pro: It costs the government far more to pay for the incarceration of a criminal than to pay for the rehabilitation of a drug user \([McVay, Schiraldi and Ziedenberg, p. 5](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/04-01_rep_mdtreatmentorincarceration_ac-dp.pdf)\).
1.1.5.3.2.4.1. Pro: It is better to spend the same money on rehabilitating drug users and creating opportunities for them out of jail, than doing the same with them imprisoned.
1.1.5.3.3. Pro: Governments would benefit from additional revenue through the implementation of a tax on drugs as is already the case with alcohol and tobacco.
1.1.5.3.3.1. Pro: Taxes on the legal use of recreational marijuana in Colorado generated a total of $135 million in additional revenue, $35 million of which was designated for school construction projects. [\(Dillis et al, p.25\)](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa799.pdf)
1.1.5.3.3.2. Pro: Drugs are among the most [illegally traded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade#Profits) goods. To receive taxes on such a product - with high demands and big sales - would bring billions to the states and communities.
1.1.5.3.3.2.1. Pro: The additional revenue can put back into health, social care and deprived areas to improve the outlook of marginalized and vulnerable people in society eventually reducing addiction and crime rates in the process.
1.1.5.3.3.3. Pro: Revenues from tobacco tax are huge. In the US they amount to [$18 billion](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/tobacco-tax-revenue).
1.1.5.3.3.4. Pro: Income from alcohol tax is significant. In the US it amounts to [$6 billion](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/alcohol-tax-revenue).
1.1.5.4. Pro: The UN estimated that the illegal drug market creates a turnover of around [$360 - $400 billion annually](http://www.worldometers.info/drugs/). A legalization of drugs enables private companies and individuals to enter this profitable market.
1.1.5.4.1. Pro: After the legalization of marijuana in some US states the [legal cannabis market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/2017/02/22/marijuana-industry-projected-to-create-more-jobs-than-manufacturing-by-2020/#416afd73fa92) created an estimated $7.2 billion in 2016 with an annual rate of growth of 17%.
1.1.5.4.1.1. Pro: A report suggests that the [cannabis industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/2017/02/22/marijuana-industry-projected-to-create-more-jobs-than-manufacturing-by-2020/#416afd73fa92) in the US will create more than 250,000 jobs till 2020.
1.1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.2.4.1.
1.1.5.6. Con: The Civil War was very costly and slavery was a benefit to the economy but human rights policies are not always based on cost/benefit analysis.
1.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.6.1.
1.1.8. Con: An analysis of Prohibition suggests that legal deterrents have little effect on limiting consumption \([Miron & Zwiebel, p. 246](https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/users/jcalhoun/Courses/Growth_of_American_Economy/Chapter_Supplemental_Readings/Chapter_22/Miron-Alcohol_Consumption_during_Prohibition.pdf)\).
1.1.8.1. Pro: After Prohibition was repealed, Americans' alcohol consumption did not substantially increase \([Miron & Zwiebel, p. 246](https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/users/jcalhoun/Courses/Growth_of_American_Economy/Chapter_Supplemental_Readings/Chapter_22/Miron-Alcohol_Consumption_during_Prohibition.pdf)\).
1.1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.2. Pursue a '[war on drugs](http://www.drugpolicy.org/facts/new-solutions-drug-policy/brief-history-drug-war-0)' with harsh policies for both the consumption and trade of drugs \(not including alcohol\).
1.2.1. Pro: Given that drugs are not necessary for a happy life, the huge harms they cause are reason to punish their use strongly.
1.2.1.1. Con: People assign different value to different types of harm. Large consumption of certain types of food can be as harmful as drugs and these are not banned.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.2.1.2. Con: Some drugs can have certain positive effects for the individual taking them.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: This ignores the highly [addictive](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/understanding-drug-use-addiction) nature of some drugs. Even if a user initially aims to take them in a responsible way, this can quickly spiral into a dangerous addiction.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: This argument could apply to any addictive substance. The correct way to approach addiction is to improve treatment programmes and make them more accessible, not to ban addictive substances.
1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.2.4.4.
1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Con: improving treatment programs and accessibility does not guarantee one is ready or willing to approach addiction.
1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.2.4.6.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: A number of recreational drugs may have [medical uses](http://www.livescience.com/41277-health-benefits-illegal-drugs.html) and health benefits.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: LSD can treat depression and other severe mental illnesses.
1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Scientists have found possible uses for LSD and other psychedelic drugs in [treating](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/oct/23/lsd-ecstacy-health-benefits) anorexia nervosa, cluster headaches and chronic anxiety attacks.
1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Harvard Medical School interviewed cluster [headache](https://clusterbusters.org/treatments-options-choices-and-more/medications-for-cluster-headache/psilocybin-and-lsd-in-the-treatment-of-cluster-headaches/) patients who used LSD to treat their condition and seven out of eight said it relieved the headaches and helped put them in remission.
1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: A study at McLean Hospital found that the quantity of the drug can be far below the psychedelic dosage in order to be [effective](https://clusterbusters.org/treatments-options-choices-and-more/medications-for-cluster-headache/psilocybin-and-lsd-in-the-treatment-of-cluster-headaches/).
1.2.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Researchers provided terminal [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy#cite_note-15) patients with LSD to see if it could help reduce their anxieties about death. One third of the patients said they felt dramatically less tense, less depressed, less afraid of death and in less pain. Another third reported these conditions reduced moderately and the last group said their condition did not improve at all, but also did not worsen.
1.2.1.2.2.1.3. Con: The use of LSD can impair decision-making and, in some cases, can [cause acute anxiety and depression](https://www.drugs.com/illicit/lsd.html).
1.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: [Ketamine](http://inventorspot.com/articles/magic_k_proves_be_magic_drug_depression) has proven to be quite adept at treating clinical depression, even in persons who have not responded to other treatments.
1.2.1.2.2.3. Con: This is a reason to provide these drugs in a controlled fashion when medically necessary, not to legalise them wholesale.
1.2.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: You can legalise marijuana for medical purposes without having to legalise recreational use of the drug, as is the case in [Australia](http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/medical-marijuana-legal-in-australia-what-it-means-for-you/news-story/b61f0238f84be843855c20605bc17ed1) and [29 US States](http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881).
1.2.1.2.2.4. Pro: [Cannabinoids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202504/) have great medical benefits.
1.2.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Marijuana contains [THC](https://patients4medicalmarijuana.wordpress.com/marijuana-info/marijuana-vs-cigarettes/), which is a bronchial dilator. It opens up the lungs, which aids clearance of smoke and dirt.
1.2.1.2.2.4.2. Pro: [Marijuana](http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2013/03/05/psychological-benefits-of-marijuana-usage/) has been found to have numerous benefits to mental health, as well as being a strong pain reliever.
1.2.1.2.2.4.3. Pro: Marijuana [increases appetite](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/07/31/keep-toke-alive-356032.html) for very sick cancer patients.
1.2.1.2.2.4.4. Pro: Medical [marijuana](http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/features/medical-marijuana-uses) is known to successfully treat pain, muscle spasms, nausea from chemotherapy and seizure disorders.
1.2.1.2.2.4.4.1. Pro: Marijuana seems to be one of the [best](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3730175/) general painkillers during cancer treatment.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5. Con: Long-term marijuana usage has negative effects.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.1. Pro: Consistent use of marijuana can have hugely damaging effects on [brain development, learning ability and mental health](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana).
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.1.1. Pro: Those who have used marijuana have [an increased likelihood](http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/cannabis.aspx) of developing mental health conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.1.2. Con: The same is true for the consistent use of alcohol or the consistent participation in boxing matches or games of[American football](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/25/health/cte-nfl-players-brains-study/index.html), yet those things are legal.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.2. Con: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27249330) in New Zealand found that consistent use of cannabis is less harmful than consistent use of tobacco long term.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.3. Pro: Long-term marijuana use can lead to [obstructive lung disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2720277/).
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.3.1. Con: Smoking isn't the only way to consume cannabis.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.4. Pro: One small study found that frequent users of marijuana had a lung cancer risk of [6 times higher](http://www.menshealth.com/health/does-smoking-pot-cause-lung-cancer) than non-users.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.4.5.2.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.4.2. Con: A more [comprehensive earlier](http://www.menshealth.com/health/does-smoking-pot-cause-lung-cancer) study found that pot smokers are not at an enhanced risk of lung cancer.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.6. Con: The majority of users worldwide smoke marijuana mixed with tobacco, which has known adverse effects especially in form of a joint without a coal filter.
Most studies rely on these combined uses, therefore the pure effect of marijuana use is understudied.
According to new studies, the combined effect of tobacco and marijuana affects the cognitive system differently, such as short-term memory.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.7. Pro: Long-term and intensive marijuana consumption can cause a only recently acknowledged clinical condition called '[Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576702/)', that causes cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.7.1. Pro: The [Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/obscure-vomiting-illness-linked-to-long-term-pot-use/) has been seen more often by emergency physicians in states with loosened marijuana laws such as Colorado and California.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.7.2. Con: The syndrome can be [easily cured](http://The syndrome can be easily cured by stopping to consume marijuana.) by stopping to consume marijuana.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.7.2.1. Con: There are [reports](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/obscure-vomiting-illness-linked-to-long-term-pot-use/) claiming that affected individuals often do not believe the physicians and keep on with marijuana consumption.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.7.3. Pro: [Affected consumers](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/obscure-vomiting-illness-linked-to-long-term-pot-use/) loose significant amounts of their bodyweight within a relatively short period of time.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.7.4. Pro: The syndrome can cause [severe consequences](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/obscure-vomiting-illness-linked-to-long-term-pot-use/) for people's lives, as this case shows: A woman has suffered physical pain for 17 years; lost jobs and huge amounts of money to cover the medical bills.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.7.4.1. Con: This claim is an argument by anecdote: The case of a single individual is neither representative, nor can it be used to establish a general rule.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.8. Con: Long-term use of many foods has an equally or even more damaging effect.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.8.1. Con: As the consumption of marijuana [stimulates appetite](http://themedicinejournal.com/articles/why-marijuana-makes-you-hungry/) \(uncontrolled "munchies"\), marijuana users are more likely to be subject to some foods' negative side effects.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.8.2. Pro: Sugar is a potentially dangerous substance with many, partly drastic and drug-like, negative effects on humans.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.8.2.1. Pro: Excessive [sugar](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-too-much-added-sugar-increases-the-risk-of-dying-with-heart-disease-201402067021) consumption drastically increases the likeliness of heart disease.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.8.2.2. Pro: Sugar is highly addictive: The consumption of sugar releases significant amounts of [dopamine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15987666), equally to the consumption of tobacco or cocaine.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5.8.2.3. Pro: Excessive sugar consumption damages the [liver](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sugar-liver-diabetes#section2).
1.2.1.2.2.5. Pro: Victims of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \(PTSD\) are showing a positive response to treatments involving [ecstasy/MDMA](http://www.mdmaptsd.org/).
1.2.1.2.2.6. Pro: Small doses of [magic mushrooms](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6210694.stm) or LSD have been known to treat cluster headaches without the psychedelic effects and are also promising in treating OCD.
1.2.1.2.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Drugs can [fuel creativity](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-04-22/do-alcohol-and-pot-really-make-you-more-creative-it-depends).
1.2.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.2.1.2.5. Pro: Drugs [are](http://highexistence.com/85/) [fun](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/doing-drugs-is-fun-paris-lees) if [used responsibly](http://www.stuartmcmillen.com/blog/breaking-silence-responsible-drug-use/).
1.2.1.3. Pro: A [75-year long study](https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/want-a-life-of-fulfillment-a-75-year-harvard-study-says-to-prioritize-this-one-t.html) came to the conclusion that good relationships are the most important factor to create sustainable and fulfilling happiness.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Some people use drugs to [enhance](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/the-case-for-using-drugs-to-enhance-our-relationships-and-our-break-ups/272615/) their relationships.
1.2.1.4. Con: Many of the harms of drug use only accrue at the point they are used to excess. Casual drug users can gain plenty of happiness at a relatively low cost to their health and well-being.
1.2.1.5. Pro: The sanctity of the human body is absolute. Nobody should put drugs and destructive substances in their bodies.
1.2.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.2.1.6. Con: Communal use of soft drugs such as alcohol and marijuana can be a bonding experience.
1.2.2. Pro: This policy has been effective where it has been practised.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Singapore has a successful track record of drug related crimes thanks to an extremely harsh policy.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: [Drug prevalence](https://www.pacsafe.com/blog/5-countries-with-shockingly-severe-drug-laws/) in Singapore is among the world’s lowest.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: In [Singapore](https://www.opendemocracy.net/drugpolicy/kirsten-han/how-discovering-truth-about-singapore-s-war-on-drugs-led-me-to-campaign-to-abolish-death), drug possession is punished with the death-penalty. This is a disproportionate punishment. It is a policy of fear, not of education.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Singapore's drug laws are harsh, but they have [saved thousands](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/05/singapore-policy-drugs-bay) from drug addiction and the resulting harms.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: In [Indonesia](http://idpc.net/alerts/2016/05/does-the-death-penalty-reduce-drug-use-and-drug-related-crime-data-from-indonesia), where execution is a frequent conviction for drug offenders, drug crime rates have not fallen. This shows the inadequacy of an overly harsh policy.
1.2.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.2.1.
1.2.2.1.5. Con: [Drug-related crimes](http://thediplomat.com/2013/11/singapore-and-the-death-penalty/) are far worse in Singapore than in countries like Turkey or Costa Rica.
1.2.2.1.6. Con: Singapore is very small which makes it easy to control. Also, there are cases of use but not reported or charged. Read Once A Jolly Hangman by Shadrake.
1.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.3.
1.2.2.3. Con: In Latin America, the war on drugs mission ['Plan Colombia'](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35491504) has been extremely ineffective.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Plan Colombia is destroying the environment without eliminating the supply of drugs.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: [Aerial eradication](http://www.aida-americas.org/project/plancolombia) of drug plants failed to reduce supplies and instead destroyed farmers' livelihoods and caused environmental damage.
1.2.2.3.1.2. Pro: The destruction of coca fields in South America forces producers to move location repeatedly, [spreading the detrimental effects](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/impact-drug-policy-environment-20151208.pdf) of their coca growing.
1.2.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Producers are often forced into remote areas or national parks, exacerbating the environmental effects by destroying more ecologically significant areas.
1.2.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: The eradication of drug plantations in one country has led to the movement of production into other countries in the region. This is known as the [Balloon Effect](http://www.coha.org/the-balloon-effect-and-displacement-part-2-of-2/).
1.2.2.3.1.3. Pro: Fumigation, the most common method of drug plantation destruction, destroys wildlife, crops and causes health problems for local people. \([McSweeney, p. 6](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/impact-drug-policy-environment-20151208.pdf)\)
1.2.2.4. Con: [Prohibition](http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/alcohol-prohibition-was-failure) showed that a policy that runs counter to a significant demand is bound to fail.
1.2.2.4.1. Pro: Prohibition just made many [criminals rich](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/26/lawless-prohibition-gangsters-speakeasies), by having them import or distill alcohol illegally.
1.2.2.5. Con: The war on drugs in the United States has been a failure.
1.2.2.5.1. Con: Cocaine use decreased by [20%](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/weekinreview/echoes-of-prohibition-20-years-of-war-on-drugs-and-no-victory-yet.html) between 1988 and 1992.
1.2.2.5.2. Pro: The US population has a serious [prescription drug abuse](https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2016/americas-addiction-to-opioids-heroin-prescription-drug-abuse) problem.
1.2.2.5.3. Pro: In 2012, the [US](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/WDR2012/WDR_2012_web_small.pdf) was one of the world's main consumers for most types of illegal drugs.
1.2.2.5.4. Pro: By 2005 half a million Americans were [imprisoned](http://today.law.harvard.edu/feature/war-drugs-succeeding/) for drug offences. This is not a sign of success.
1.2.2.5.5. Pro: The [drug-related crime rate](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/weekinreview/echoes-of-prohibition-20-years-of-war-on-drugs-and-no-victory-yet.html) increased during the US war on drugs.
1.2.2.5.5.1. Con: Correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Just because the crime rate increased during this time does not mean that it was in direct response to any of the "war on drugs" policies.
1.2.2.5.5.1.1. Con: At the very least, it implies that the War on Drugs did not succeed.
1.2.2.5.6. Pro: Most of US spending was focused on [enforcement](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/weekinreview/echoes-of-prohibition-20-years-of-war-on-drugs-and-no-victory-yet.html) rather than prevention and education.
1.2.2.5.7. Pro: Drug related [crimes became worse](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/weekinreview/echoes-of-prohibition-20-years-of-war-on-drugs-and-no-victory-yet.html) between the 1970s and the early 1990s, including machine gun battles between police and drug offenders.
1.2.2.6. Con: The war on drugs in the Philippines has been [devastating](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/28/asia/philippines-voices-drugs-war/index.html) and has had very limited positive effects.
1.2.2.6.1. Pro: Dr John Collins, an expert on drug policy, [said](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/09/philippines-duterte-killer-drug-war-160905094258461.html) of the drug war, "Targeting the supply side can have short term effects. However these are usually limited to creating market chaos rather than reducing the size of the market."
1.2.2.6.2. Pro: The government has [failed](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/asia/in-philippine-drug-war-little-help-for-those-who-surrender.html) to provide effective treatment to those who confess to drug use, meaning that demand for drugs has remained high.
1.2.2.6.3. Pro: The drug war has [compromised internal security](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/09/kill-list-phillipines-duterte-mass-murder-china-united-states-rivalry-war-on-drugs).
1.2.2.7. Con: Fighting drug trafficking by military means is [ineffective](http://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R3594.html) and has little impact.
1.2.3. Con: Policies such as mandatory minimums remove flexibility from the justice system and often incarcerate people who should not be in prison.
1.2.3.1. Pro: In the US, this disproportionately [targets](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/141027_iachr_racial_disparities_aclu_submission_0.pdf) minorities which contributes to their distrust of the police and government.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Judge Ralph Gants, the highest-ranking judge in Massachusetts, has said that the state's mandatory minimum laws [treat a drug courier the same as a kingpin](http://www.wbur.org/news/2015/06/10/mandatory-minimum-sentences-primer).
1.2.3.3. Con: Mandatory minimums and a war on drugs do not necessarily overlap.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: While they do not always occur together, mandatory minimums are a likely product of a society which views all drug use as intolerable.
1.2.4. Pro: Drugs are hugely destructive to the environment.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The production of one gram of [cocaine](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/19/cocaine-rainforests-columbia-santos-calderon) destroys four square meters of rain forest.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Dubious claim. The article cited is over 10 years old. At a production rate of 190 metric tons per year, Columbia's rain forest would surely be gone by now. \(190mt X 2200lb X 16oz X 28g X 10y X 4m / 1610m = 4.652 million miles. Thats twice the size of the Amazon rain forest.\)
1.2.4.2. Pro: Opium production in Myanmar has caused vast [deforestation and soil damage](http://frontiermyanmar.net/en/the-poppies-and-the-damage-done).
1.2.4.3. Pro: Every pound of methamphetamine produced creates [three to six pounds of toxic waste](https://www.treehugger.com/green-food/methamphetamines-pollute-more-than-the-body.html). These by-products can [destroy soil and water supplies](http://alcoholrehab.com/drug-addiction/environment-and-drug-production/) and have been known to kill animals.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Cannabis production is [immensely damaging](http://www.geocurrents.info/place/north-america/northern-california/unnecessary-environmental-destruction-marijuana-cultivation-united-states) to the environment. Indoor growing comes with a large carbon footprint, while outdoor growing necessitates the use of pesticides, rodenticides and large amounts of water.
1.2.4.4.1. Con: If cannabis were legalised, organic production would likely become more popular.
1.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: It is impossible to certify whether production is sustainable while it is illegal. Under a legal, regulated market, this would not be the case.
1.2.4.4.1.2. Pro: Marijuana production is more expensive under an illegal market because of the risks of being caught. Organic production is also more expensive than non-organic production. Growers are unlikely to shoulder the costs of illegal production and organic production simultaneously.
1.2.4.4.2. Con: With legalization indoor growing will not be necessary anymore as growers do not have to fear their plantations will be detected.
1.2.4.4.3. Con: How is this any different from growing any other plant? In the end cannabis is just a plant that grows just as well in nature
1.2.4.4.4. Con: This is partially offset by the fact that hemp production is remarkably more efficient and sustainable than traditional paper alternatives.[Uses and environmental impact of hemp.](https://hemtecusa.com/page33/page33.html)
1.2.4.5. Con: The war on drugs has done far more damage to the environment than drug production.
1.2.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.3.
1.2.4.5.2. Pro: Air fumigation of Colombian coca plantations has led to [deforestation and displacement](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718512002837;) of local people.
1.2.4.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.2.
1.2.4.6. Con: Criminalising drugs does not eliminate the demand for them, and the demand incentivises supply. Therefore criminalising drugs does little to help the environment.
1.2.4.6.1. Con: Criminalising drugs means harsh punishments for suppliers and dealers. This decreases supply and therefore aids the environment.
1.2.4.6.2. Pro: The addictive nature of drugs means that some people will always buy them.
1.2.4.6.2.1. Pro: Drug addiction is a complex [disease](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/understanding-drug-abuse-addiction) rather than a crime.
1.2.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: Addiction is a chronic disease characterised by compulsive drug use and loss of control.
1.2.4.6.2.1.2. Pro: Repeated drug use can lead to brain changes that challenge an addicted person’s self-control.
1.2.4.6.3. Pro: [9.4%](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends) of the American population is estimated to have used an illicit drug in the past month. This is [far higher](https://mic.com/articles/110344/14-years-after-portugal-decriminalized-all-drugs-here-s-what-s-happening#.9aq9vA45s) than in Portugal, where drug use is decriminalised.
1.2.4.6.4. Con: Criminalisation does reduce demand to a large extent: potential drug users choose not to consume drugs for fear of going to prison.
1.2.4.7. Con: With legalization, we can regulate production processes to be greener.
1.2.5. Con: The war on drugs cannot be won because demand for drugs will always exist.
1.2.5.1. Pro: [The use of psychoactive substances](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3202501/) has been part of human culture for thousands of years; drugs have been used for religious, medical or recreational purposes.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: The consumption of psychoactive substances creates religious and transcendental [experiences](https://www.sciencealert.com/how-religion-led-to-humanity-s-love-for-drugs): both are a relevant part of human evolution and significantly shaped human culture.
1.2.5.1.2. Con: Tradition is no proof of morality or goodness: e.g. slavery has been a human tradition for thousands of years.
1.2.5.2. Pro: There are several different [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_models_of_human_drug_use) explaining drug consumption evolutionarily, e.g. the Sexual Selection Hypothesis, and thus as part of human nature.
1.2.5.3. Con: Alcohol works as a substitute drug that replaces the demand for drugs.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: Medical marijuana has spillover effects and increases alcohol abuse in adults either as a substitute of or together with marijuana \([Wen et al., p. 21](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20085.pdf)\).
1.2.5.4. Con: The war on racism cannot be won but we fight it anyway because the decision to fight a war isn't solely based on whether or not it is winnable.
1.2.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.
1.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.
1.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.
1.2.8. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.2.9. Con: Prohibition has unintended negative consequences.
1.2.9.1. Pro: People are less likely to seek help for addiction when drug use is criminalized.
1.2.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.9.3. Pro: Black markets created by such policies tend to create violence and provide a source of revenue for gangs.
1.2.9.4. Pro: Prohibition artificially inflates the price of drugs astronomically. Addiction drives compulsive consumption. Lack of funds to support habits leads to robbery and theft. Alcoholics don't do armed robberies because their drug is legal, and therefore affordable.
1.2.10. Con: When drugs are illegal their production and distribution is not subject to any regulation and are often cut with other cheaper but sometimes more dangerous substances like Fentanyl or PMA. This is incredibly dangerous and ultimately leads to more loss of life which could have been unavoidable under a more pragmatic system.
1.2.11. Con: It is extremely hypocritical to say that all drugs should be illegal, but alcohol, which is proven to be one of the worst drugs out there, is fine and should be legal
1.3. Allow the use of drugs for medicinal purposes. Illegal consumption and trade is punished while still offering treatment for users, as seen in India.
1.3.1. Pro: Many recreational drugs have hugely beneficial medical uses.
1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.4.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Therapeutic doses of amphetamine have proven to be able to cause nerve growth in humans suffering from conditions such as [ADHD](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2670101/).
1.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.2.
1.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.5.
1.3.1.5. Pro: MDMA may be able to treat [Parkinson's](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3015-ecstasy-has-dramatic-effect-on-parkinsons-symptoms/) disease through the release of serotonin levels in the brain.
1.3.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.6.
1.3.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.1.
1.3.1.8. Con: There are no benefits in the use of the [crocodile drug](http://time.com/3398086/the-worlds-deadliest-drug-inside-a-krokodil-cookhouse/) which is extremely difficult to withdraw from and leads to near-certain death.
1.3.1.8.1. Con: [Crocodile](http://www.narconon.org/drug-information/krokodil.html) is a highly specific drug that can be predominantly found in Russia used by those who no longer are able to afford heroin.
1.3.1.8.1.1. Pro: The possibility that casual users around the globe come across crocodile is very low.
1.3.1.8.1.2. Pro: Unlike most Western countries, the Russian Federation has no opioid [replacement programs](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/3/08-010308/en/) or methadone clinics. The lack of such programs fosters the development of illegal and dangerous replacements like crocodile.
1.3.1.9. Con: [Crystal Meth](http://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/crystalmeth/the-deadly-effects-of-meth.html) has only negligible benefits when compared to its devastating consequences.
1.3.1.9.1. Con: If crystal meth is not medically useful, its use will not be legalised.
1.3.2. Pro: States can have strict punishments for distribution while also taking harm reduction measures for those affected by illness and addiction.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Government [methadone](http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/methadone) programs \(where proven hard drug addicts are provided daily methadone doses for free\) have proven to be very successful.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Methadone is safer for drug users than heroin.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Methadone programs save addicts from drug-related dangers such as [dirty needles](http://www.towardsrecovery.com/methadone-treatment-controversy/).
1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Free distribution of disposable needles does the same and is cheaper.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Heroin causes [harm](http://drugabuse.com/library/the-effects-of-heroin-use/) to the body, especially street heroin which is often cut with dangerous substances.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Methadone treatment programs have been found to reduce the level of acquisitive crime - crimes committed to buy drugs - to [one-eighth](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9494936) the level it was before.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Some drug users are forced into exploitative situations, such as forced prostitution, to feed their habits. These programs rid drug users of the need to do this.
1.3.2.1.4. Pro: Methadone programmes reduce the profit of drug dealers and criminals.
1.3.2.1.4.1. Con: Illegal drug dealing is not regulated. Dealers can adjust their overall prices or diversify their offer to match the profit margins attained prior to the introduction of methadone programmes.
1.3.2.1.4.1.1. Con: If dealers could adjust their prices or diversify their offers in order to increase their profit margins then they would have done so already.
1.3.2.1.4.2. Pro: As a result, there are fewer hard drugs in the streets as it is not profitable to sell them anymore.
1.3.2.1.5. Con: Methadone programmes have the undesired outcome of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome and [increased perinatal mortality.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apa.13046/abstract) They fail to protect the most vulnerable victims of all.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Harm reduction has been successfully integrated into [sexual health programmes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528824/)  to reduce HIV infections, unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.
1.3.2.3. Con: Medical marijuana legislation [increases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099393) the number of overall marijuana users. This leads to an increase of those abusing marijuana.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Medical marijuana legalization creates a de facto legalized environment for marijuana.
1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: Most implementations of medical marijuana legislation lacked a patient registry and renewal system. This blurred the boundary between patients and non-patient \([Wen et al., p. 5](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20085.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: Supply channels are out of state control as home growing is often allowed where medical marijuana is legalized \([Wen et al., p. 5](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20085.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3.1.3. Pro: Medical justifications for marijuana prescriptions are generally vague, such as 'chronic pain'. As pain is hard to show this makes marijuana available to nearly everyone \([Wen et al., p. 4](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20085.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3.2. Con: [Replications](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22285867) of studies that showed an increase in marijuana use and lowered risk perception failed to confirm the results and rather illustrate that consumption stayed stable.
1.3.2.3.3. Con: Comparing [40 states](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23763418), only two showed signs of increased consumption following medical marijuana legalization. This is associated with pure chance rather than causation.
1.3.2.3.3.1. Con: This study was focused on adolescents. Extending it to the population at large shows that adults are at a higher risk of abuse when medical marijuana is legal \([Wen et al., p. 24](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20085.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3.4. Pro: [A study](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/26/study-finds-increase-in-illicit-pot-use-abuse-in-s/) found strong indications that medical marijuana laws are responsible for an increase in illegal consumption and abuse of marijuana in the affected US states.
1.3.2.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.3.1.
1.3.2.4. Pro: Indian NGOs distribute [buprenorphine tablets](http://idhdp.com/media/400258/idpc-briefing-paper_drug-policy-in-india.pdf) that fight heavy opioid addictions.
1.3.2.5. Pro: [Clean needles](http://idhdp.com/media/400258/idpc-briefing-paper_drug-policy-in-india.pdf) are distributed to prevent the spread of HIV.
1.3.3. Con: This system would be open to widespread abuse.
1.3.3.1. Con: If oversight of the health system is strict, this doesn't need to happen.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Recreational drug users could feign illness or convince doctors within their social circle to prescribe 'medicinal' drugs for recreational purposes.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.3.
1.3.3.3. Pro: It would be relatively easy for people with illnesses to sell or supply drugs to others.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: This would still be illegal, with harsh punishments for those who broke the law.
1.3.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.1.
1.3.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.3.3.6. Pro: Corrupt doctors and physicians illegally prescribe drugs in order to increase their earnings.
1.3.3.6.1. Pro: A former New York assemblyman and doctor sold illegal prescriptions for more than [6 million opioid pills](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-opioids-idUSKBN17933P).
1.3.3.6.2. Con: This happens under the status quo and it is not a reason to ban prescription drugs. It therefore should not be a reason to ban any drug with a medical purpose.
1.3.3.6.3. Pro: The [DEA](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/crim_admin_actions/doctors_criminal_cases.pdf) conducts hundreds of legal cases against doctors based on violations of the Narcotics Law.
1.3.3.6.3.1. Con: This only proves that it is still possible to catch and punish those who abuse the system.
1.3.4. Con: Consumption of drugs within an official medical frame leads to the perception that drugs are harmless or even healthy.
1.3.4.1. Pro: This impression is likely intensified by pharmaceutical companies' marketing departments trying to sell large amounts of drugs.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Marketing created the image that aspirin is a harmless drug. In fact, there is evidence that points into a different direction: aspirin or medicine which contains the substance can cause considerable health damage.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3086018/) found strong indications that regular consumption of considerable doses of aspirin is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding.
1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: The [FDA](http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/08/04/daily-aspirin-side-effects.aspx) recommends not to use aspirin as preventive medication to reduce the risks of heart attacks or strokes, as the potential health risks are higher than potential benefits.
1.3.4.2. Con: Many life-saving drugs are not harmless, but they are still the best option to treat serious illnesses. The perception that drugs can be beneficial is only wrong if it isn't true.
1.3.5. Con: The use of drugs for medical purposes under current legislation has already caused negative consequences. Therefore, an extension of this practice has to be avoided.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Potent drugs such as [opioids](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/29/health/gupta-unintended-consequences/index.html) are frequently used for medical purposes with a devastating effect: those painkillers increase the likeliness of a following opioid addiction or even heroin consumption.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Opioids are generally safe if used legally and responsibly.
1.3.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.3.6. Con: Legalizing medical marijuana doesn't [change](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa799.pdf) much compared to it being illegal. Hopes for improvements of any kind do not materialize.
1.4. Decriminalise the personal consumption of drugs, while strongly punishing the illegal trade of all drugs \(such as in the Netherlands [or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_Portugal#Laws_and_regulations) [Portugal](http://www.attn.com/stories/1604/countries-with-the-most-progressive-drug-laws-world)\).
1.4.1. Pro: When drug possession is criminalised, being an addict or even using drugs casually can lead to prison. There, ordinary citizens are likely to engage in more criminal behaviour in order to survive.
1.4.1.1. Pro: This exposes people imprisoned for drug consumption to criminal organisations during their stay in prison, increasing the possibility of engaging in criminal activities post release.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Drug offenders are likely to engage in violent behaviour in prison.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: The [deprivation model](https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/188706/causes2.pdf) of prison behaviour holds that the prison environment and loss of freedom cause deep psychological trauma, and prisoners' need for self-preservation results in the creation of a deviant prison subculture that promotes violence.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: The [importation model](https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/188706/causes2.pdf) of prison behaviour holds that many prisoners have violent histories and links to criminal groups, and that this fosters the creation of a violent atmosphere within prison. Even if drug offenders were not violent before prison, it is likely that the atmosphere will affect them.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Many prisoners [join prison gangs](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/11/economist-explains-7) to gain protection from violence in prison or access to drugs.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Prison makes drug addiction worse, and introduces addiction to prisoners who have never used drugs.
1.4.1.4.1. Pro: Approximately [half](http://www.prisonerhealth.org/educational-resources/factsheets-2/incarceration-substance-abuse-and-addiction/) of all prisoners in the US meet the criteria for substance dependency or addiction.
1.4.1.4.2. Pro: The drug trade [thrives](https://www.thefix.com/content/prison-drug-dealing-oxycontin90211) in prisons; prisoners are able to easily access hard drugs inside.
1.4.1.4.3. Pro: Drug treatment programmes in prison [tend to fail](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/03/11/prisons-are-making-americas-drug-problem-worse).
1.4.1.5. Con: The same argument would apply to any other non-violent crime, such as tax fraud.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: Perpetrators of tax fraud cause damage to the economy and people's livelihoods. Unlike drug possession, this is not a victimless crime.
1.4.1.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.2.
1.4.2. Pro: A policy that decriminalizes drugs is beneficial for those who are addicted to them.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Often it is not the drugs themselves which destroy people, but the criminal activities they get pushed into.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: There is a [strong correlation](https://www.ncadd.org/about-addiction/alcohol-drugs-and-crime) between drug users and those who are exploited by the sex trade.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: As well as being a pre-determining factor in such sexual exploitation, it is also a means of coping with it. Criminalising drugs is therefore an egregious misapplication of punishment on vulnerable people trying to cope.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Young people who use drugs are [more likely](https://www.ojjdp.gov/jjbulletin/9808/why.html) to join gangs than those who do not; this often happens because gangs can offer young drug users easy access to drugs.
1.4.2.1.3. Con: Drug consumption is harmful to people regardless of whether it is associated with crime. The use of [cocaine](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/cocaine) or [heroin](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/heroin) can be very physically harmful in themselves.
1.4.2.1.3.1. Con: Maintaining the ban on recreational drugs does not alleviate those harms for addicts; they have limited ability to stop their addiction and criminalising them will not help.
1.4.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.6.2.1.
1.4.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.2.
1.4.2.1.4. Pro: Drug users are often [forced into crime](https://www.ncadd.org/about-addiction/alcohol-drugs-and-crime) to feed their habit; they are far more likely to be arrested for acquisitive crime.
1.4.2.1.4.1. Con: Drug-related crimes are often [acquisitive crimes](https://www.ncadd.org/about-addiction/alcohol-drugs-and-crime) such as theft, which users engage in to feed their habit. The need for users to commit these crimes would not change under legalisation.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1. Con: This is not the case if drugs become cheaper as they will be able to get the same drugs at a lower cost.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: There would be a greater supply of drugs which would likely decrease the cost.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: If they are legal, the demand is also likely to increase so this would be offset.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Legalisation will lead to an increase in the number of drug users and therefore drug addicts.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: With legalisation, there is likely to be an increase in services for drug users which may decrease the addiction problem.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Additionally, addicts are more likely to seek out these services if they don't feel as stigmatised.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: In [Portugal](https://news.vice.com/article/ungass-portugal-what-happened-after-decriminalization-drugs-weed-to-heroin), decriminalization was accompanied by needle exchange and opioid substitution programs.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Methadone clinics and heroine injecting rooms become viable when drug use is less stigmatised.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: There is also an incentive for legitimate companies to support the creation of these as it will protect the safety of their users and thus increase their profits.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: An increase in the number of drug users and therefore drug addicts will have extremely negative consequences for individuals and society.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.2.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: Drug addiction can [ruin a person's life](http://lastingrecovery.com/107-ways-addiction-can-ruin-life/) in dozens of different ways.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: If correctly addressed and assisted by the user's community it can be remediated and at least reduced
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.4. Pro: More than [50,000 people](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates) died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2015, even alongside harsh legislation. This number would likely increase under legalisation.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: More than 30% of those fatalities are caused by overdoses from [prescription opioid pain relievers](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates). Different drug legislation would unlikely affect this significant part.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Many deaths occur due to addiction which was initially caused by the legal prescription of drugs for medical purposes . The legality of use doesn't really make a difference here, except that addicts are very often forced to participate in black market activities - which can be inherently dangerous. [www.unityrehab.com](https://www.unityrehab.com/blog/simple-injury-can-lead-heroin-addiction/)
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.2. Pro: A considerable number of individuals use drug overdoses as a way to [commit suicide](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/avypkp/how-many-drug-overdoses-are-actually-suicides). This number is likely to increase under drug legalisation, as the drugs are more easily procured.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.4.2.1. Pro: In [South Dakota](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/avypkp/how-many-drug-overdoses-are-actually-suicides), 29 percent of overdose deaths that occurred between 2008 and 2010 were classified as suicides.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.2.4.6.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Many teenagers consume drugs in order to [rebel](https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/teenage-drug-addiction). If drugs are no longer illegal, it is unlikely that teenagers will resort to drugs in order to rebel against their parents.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: In the 1990s, a professor from Yale University [estimated](http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/debate/myths/myths2.htm) in a study that if cocaine was legally available, cocaine users would increase by 10 times.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: Legalising drugs will likely lead to cheaper drugs as a competitive industry will arise amongst drug producers. Basic economic theory suggests that a decrease in the price of drugs is likely to lead to an [increase](http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/debate/myths/myths2.htm) in the demand for drugs, simply because more people will be able to afford it without any sanction.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: [A study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_liberalization#Prices_and_consumption) about the market for cocaine indicates that a 10% reduction of the cocaine's price would lead to a 14% increase in the frequency of cocaine consumption.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.7. Con: Portugal decriminalised all drugs in 2001. [As a result](https://mic.com/articles/110344/14-years-after-portugal-decriminalized-all-drugs-here-s-what-s-happening#.UP6LxiPPt), after an initial incline, overall drug usage has declined, particularly in the 15-24 year old population; drug induced deaths have declined steeply; and there has been a decrease in imprisonment on drug-related charges alongside a surge in visits to health clinics that deal with addiction and disease.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.7.1. Con: [Drug use increased](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ondcp/Fact_Sheets/portugal_fact_sheet_8-25-10.pdf) after decriminalisation in Portugal for cocaine, LSD, amphetamines, ecstasy, and cannabis.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.8. Pro: Legal availability of addictive substances leads more people to use them than when banned or regulated.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.8.1. Con: Black markets will meet the demand for these substances.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.8.2. Con: Nowhere is it proven that legalizing causes to increase consumption. [The Netherlands](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-countries-that-smoke-the-most-cannabis/) are 30th in line of cannabis consumption. In Portugal, consumption of drugs decreased by half when they decriminalized drugs.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.8.3. Pro: This can be seen in the [legalisation](http://www.drugrehab.us/news/does-marijuana-legalization-lead-to-increased-use/) of marijuana in some US states.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.7.1.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.8.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Producing drugs illegally is hugely costly due to the fights over turf with other gangs and the cost of avoiding law enforcement. Legal production is far cheaper.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Legal consequences increase the market price of drugs because dealers add a [premium](http://www.academia.edu/2835091/Incarceration_of_drug_offenders_Costs_and_impacts). This reduces consumption.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Many young criminals see prison time as a [rite of passage](http://www.academia.edu/2835091/Incarceration_of_drug_offenders_Costs_and_impacts) and therefore do not fear it.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: As illegal drugs are not patent protected, they would likely be sold at base cost, like generics.
1.4.2.1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: If recreational drugs were legalised, they could be [patented](http://theconversation.com/pot-with-patents-could-plant-the-seeds-of-future-lawsuits-78580).
1.4.2.1.4.1.2. Con: Taxation could be spent on rehabilitation under legalisation.
1.4.2.1.5. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.
1.4.2.2. Pro: When drugs are criminalised, drug users are seen as engaging in criminal activity and are imprisoned. We are better placed to treat drug addicts as people with an illness rather than criminals.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: It is sensible to focus on rehabilitating drug users and treating addiction like the disease it is, instead of throwing people in jail.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Pro: Treating drug addiction like a curable disease can be immensely successful; as many as [40-60%](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/treatment-recovery) of recovered drug addicts never relapse after treatment.
1.4.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.
1.4.2.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.2.4.
1.4.2.2.1.4. Con: Incarcerating non-violent drug abusers will shock them and will make them think twice before taking drugs again.
1.4.2.2.1.4.1. Con: [77%](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/once-a-criminal-always-a-criminal/) of drug offenders will reoffend within three years of their release. Clearly, incarceration does not encourage users away from drugs.
1.4.2.2.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.4.
1.4.2.2.1.4.3. Con: Many drugs are addictive. When you are addicted, you do not make a rational choice, weighing all the potential downsides, before taking the drug. Thus showing them the consequences will not prevent them from using drugs again.
1.4.2.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: Rehabilitation to treat the addiction makes more sense than just being punished with the restriction of your freedom without any further support.
1.4.2.2.1.4.4. Con: It makes more sense to provide addicts rehabilitating treatment, and just incarcerate the people who profit from drug dealing.
1.4.2.2.1.5. Pro: There are countries where many crimes are less criminalized \(lower sentences\) and prisons are focused on helping troubled people rather than on being a penalty \(see Norway\). In those countries there are many fewer people in prisons and are safer places to live \(low crime rates\). It is a proof that decriminalization and focusing on help rather than on penalization works better. See [this video on youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxdgPnYyj64) for more elaborate information on this topic.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.6.2.1.
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.2.
1.4.2.2.4. Pro: Research shows that treatment is [far more effective](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/04-01_rep_mdtreatmentorincarceration_ac-dp.pdf) than prison in preventing recidivism and aiding reintegration.
1.4.2.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.4.2.2.5. Pro: Society should prioritise the reintegration of drug users, but prison makes it even harder for them to be [reintegrated](http://www.adpsr.org/home/lack_of_rehabilitation).
1.4.2.3. Pro: It is easier to justify policies to help drug addicts \(such as safe heroin injecting rooms\) when their actions are no longer seen as taboo.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: Legalising drugs will not necessarily lift the stigma of consuming drugs.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Since some US states have begun to legalize [marijuana](https://www.lakeforest.edu/live/news/8003-high-times-the-evolution-of-the-stigma-on), the negative image and social stigma connected to the drug's consumption are decreasing.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: If those who consume drugs are no longer arrested and sentenced to jail, their actions may not be perceived as taboo.
1.4.3. Pro: Decriminalising drug use would reduce government expenditures.
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Most drug related crimes are acquisitive, where people steal to pay for their drugs. This leads to huge costs for society, which could be reduced if drugs were legalised and the price of drugs was brought down.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: The [annual cost](http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/whyinvest2final.pdf) of drug related crime in the UK is £13.9 billion, with most of these crimes being acquisitive.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: Canada [spends](http://www.bcmj.org/article/health-care-and-fiscal-costs-illicit-drug-use-epidemic-impact-conventional-drug-control-stra) $426 million on drug enforcement policies.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: The price of drugs would come down dramatically, thus decreasing the profit margin for cartels enormously.

1.4.3.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.2.
1.4.3.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.3.
1.4.3.2.4. Pro: In 2015, the US [spent](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/chapter/economics) $9.4 billion on domestic law enforcement to prevent drug related crimes.
1.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.2.
1.4.4. Pro: Portugal's policy has been [effective](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11197559/Drug-laws-around-the-world-does-anyone-get-it-right.html) in improving health indicators by treating drug consumption as a public health issue rather than a criminal one.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Since decriminalisation, Portugal went from having a heroin epidemic to having [one of the lowest drug usage rates](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/portugal-drug-crisis-british-columbia-1.3962714) in the European Union.
1.4.4.2. Pro: The number of deaths from [street drug overdoses](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portugal-drug-decriminalization/) dropped from around 400 to 290 annually after decriminalization measures were put in place in Portugal.
1.4.4.3. Pro: [UN drug policy](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portugal-drug-decriminalization/) experts say that Portugal's policy 'appears to be working'.
1.4.4.4. Con: Portugal still has very strict [punitive measures](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/really-want-portugals-drug-laws/) in place for drug offences, such as confiscating one's passport.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: This is a statement of fact. It does not address the effectiveness of decriminalization for users. Nor does the article referenced talk about the effectiveness of the Portugal system. It talks mostly about the British System.
1.4.4.5. Con: In Portugal, decriminalization made it less dangerous for those who traffic drugs.
1.4.4.5.1. Pro: Decriminalization came with an increase in what is considered 'personal use' \([Laquer, p. 13](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Laqueur_\(2014\)_-_Uses_and_Abuses_of_Drug_Decriminalization_in_Portugal_-_LSI.pdf)\).
1.4.4.5.2. Pro: Portuguese courts reduced their punishments for drug traffickers as they increasingly identified them as consumers rather than traffickers \([Laquer, p. 13](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/Laqueur_\(2014\)_-_Uses_and_Abuses_of_Drug_Decriminalization_in_Portugal_-_LSI.pdf)\).
1.4.4.6. Pro: Contrary to initial fears, Lisbon did not transform into a '[drug mecca](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/portugal-drug-decriminalization/)'. Thus, the negative side effects of decriminalization are limited.
1.4.4.7. Con: Portugal's improvements in health indicators are [equally related to](http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blog/drug-decriminalisation-portugal-setting-record-straight) a more health-focused approach to drugs and wider health and social policy changes than to decriminalisation.
1.4.4.8. Pro: Portugal has seen a [reduction in the rate of HIV infections](http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blog/drug-decriminalisation-portugal-setting-record-straight) since decriminalisation.
1.4.5. Con: Decriminalisation opens the doors to the destructive effects of drugs on individuals and society.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Allowing marijuana consumption comes with public nuisance and dangers.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: The smell of marijuana is a nuisance to people. In certain places, if the smell of marijuana leaves the personal property of an individual, the marijuana user is [liable for a fine](http://www.eastoregonian.com/eo/local-news/20150519/pendleton-declares-marijuana-smell-a-nuisance).
1.4.5.1.3. Pro: The Netherlands has had so many problems relating to [drug tourism](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/6168993/Dutch-to-ban-drug-tourism.html) that they attempted to ban it.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Since decriminalization, there has been a [40%](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/really-want-portugals-drug-laws/) increase in homicides related to drugs in Portugal.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: A widely repeated claim is that, as a result of Portugal’s decriminalization policy, drug-related homicides increased 40% between 2001 and 2006. The 40% increase \(from 105 to 148\) was for all homicides, defined as any ‘intentional killing of a person, including murder, manslaughter, euthanasia and infanticide’ – they were not ‘drug-related’. In fact, there are no data collected for drug-related homicides."[Drug decriminalisation in Portugal: setting the record straight](http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blog/drug-decriminalisation-portugal-setting-record-straight)
1.4.5.3. Pro: Hard drugs like heroin or meth destroy people's lives and those of their family and rob these people of the capacity to make clear decisions.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.2.
1.4.5.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.
1.4.5.3.4. Con: Studies have shown that social rejection is a greater determinant for opioid addiction and that the drug fills a void created by the user circumstances. Given it is unemployment, social inadequacy, stigma, etc. [socialhealth.blog](https://socialhealth.blog/2017/08/27/painkillers-reduce-pain-from-social-rejection/)
1.4.5.3.5. Con: Hard drugs are often not the cause of the destruction, but rather means. People with destructive tendencies will self-destruct regardless - usually with other, legal options, such as alcohol.
1.4.5.3.5.1. Pro: Addiction to substances is [often started due to underlying reasons](https://youtu.be/ao8L-0nSYzg).
1.4.5.3.5.1.1. Pro: "[Psychological and environmental factors](https://www.healthyplace.com/addictions/drug-addiction/causes-of-drug-addiction-what-causes-drug-addiction) are thought to play a significant role \[in drug addiction\]. Rather than a single cause of drug addiction, it is likely multiple factors lead to drug addiction in any given person."
1.4.5.3.5.1.2. Pro: 86.8% of 364 young poly-drug users [cited alleviating depressed moods as a reason for taking drugs](https://academic.oup.com/her/article/16/4/457/558793). In this case, the depression is indeed the cause of the destruction, and drugs the means.
1.4.5.3.6. Con: Overindulgence/fixation in any one specific thing will likely result in despair. Money. Fame. Coffe. Sex. Spouse.
1.4.5.3.7. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.4.5.3.8. Pro: There is no such thing as a functioning healthy long-term meth or heroin user.
1.4.5.3.8.1. Con: This is not necessarily true; there may be many functional heroin addicts who cannot admit it or speak publicly about it for fear of stigma.
1.4.5.3.8.1.1. Pro: A high-earning businessman [admitted](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3342179/Meet-corporate-high-flyer-manages-hold-100-000-year-job-shooting-deadly-drug-day.html) to a highly functional 20-year addiction in an article in 2015 under a false name.
1.4.5.3.8.2. Con: There are [many 40- to 50-year olds](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-05/heroin-users/5238674) holding down jobs and taking care of families while sustaining a heroin habit.
1.4.5.3.8.3. Con: What is functioning healthy and long-term? Can a 20-year heroin or meth user who is 50 not be healthier than a drug free 50-year-old? functionality is absolutely possible for each body reacts different, and you did not suggest a specified amount.
1.4.5.4. Con: The door to these effects has already been opened: keeping drugs illegal does nothing to stop the demand for them.
1.4.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.4.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.4.5.1.
1.4.5.6. Pro: Decriminalization, rather than legalization, suggests that breaking the law is acceptable since while the act remains illegal, there is no strong deterrent.
1.4.5.7. Con: Decriminalization opens the door to treatment of the drug addicts and helping them re-integrating in society. Users don't have to resort to crime to get money for their drugs and criminals do not profit from it.
1.4.5.8. Con: The way drugs are produced is often dangerous and done by fairly innocent people. Farmers are pressed by criminals to have highly toxic XTC-labs in their barns and criminals use houses of poor people to grow feed with a big fire hazard as a result. Decriminalizing would mean far less fires, less dumped toxic waste.
1.4.5.9. Con: People will use drugs, if the war on drugs shows something, that's it. Drugs like weed and hash are grown by criminals with lots of \(illegal\) pesticides. Drugs are not be healthy, but the health hazard is getting bigger because of the pesticides. By decriminalizing \(soft\) drugs, weed and hash can be grown without hazardous pesticides.
1.4.5.10. Pro: The [crocodile drug](http://www.narconon.org/drug-information/krokodil.html) is extremely difficult to withdraw from and leads to near certain death.
1.4.5.10.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.8.1.
1.4.5.10.2. Con: Under a system of decriminalisation, it is unlikely people would choose to take this drug when other, safer drugs are more readily available to them.
1.4.6. Pro: By maintaining strong punishments for illegal trade, there is still a disincentive to become a drug trafficker.
1.4.6.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.5.
1.4.6.2. Con: Maintaining strong punishments for illegal trade \(and production?\) still comes with [huge expenses](https://www.npo.nl/de-rekenkamer/15-05-2014/KN_1656837#637df3096) for the government. The Netherlands still spends [a lot](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/10/22/red-de-economie-legaliseer-wiet-maar-kan-dat-eigenlijk-wel-a1499439) on chasing weed-plantations and trafficking.
1.4.7. Con: Without the proper system to educate and attend to people who consume drugs or possible consumers, decriminalisation creates an incentive for drug abuse and health problems.
1.4.8. Con: Banning drug traffic is not enough to stop it.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Drug traffic is illegal, but high demand still sustains it.
1.4.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.4.9. Con: Prohibition supports corruption.
1.4.10. Con: As long it makes it very profitable to sell drugs it will support organized crime.
1.4.11. Con: This does not support a healthy free market economy.
1.5. Legalise cannabis use while decriminalising the use of other drugs, as in Uruguay.
1.5.1. Pro: A majority of Americans now [support](http://www.gallup.com/poll/165539/first-time-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx) the legalisation of marijuana.
1.5.1.1. Con: There remains significant [public resentment](https://mic.com/articles/106094/one-year-after-uruguay-legalized-marijuana-here-s-what-it-s-become#.afSMgKMcG) against the legalisation of marijuana in Uruguay, where this policy has been implemented.
1.5.1.2. Con: Public opinion should not always decide policy. The vast majority of Americans support the [death penalty](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/6589), but that does not mean it is not harmful.
1.5.2. Pro: Smoking marijuana is less harmful than other, generally allowed, drugs like [alcohol](https://www.mpp.org/marijuana-is-safer-than-alcohol-its-time-to-treat-it-that-way/) [or tobacco](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/legal-pot/no-high-risk-marijuana-may-be-less-harmful-alcohol-tobacco-n312876). Thus, allowing it is reasonable.
1.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.4.5.1.
1.5.2.2. Pro: People become [mellow and relaxed](http://greatist.com/health/your-brain-on-marijuana) on marijuana, while on alcohol many people get very emotional and can become aggressive and agitated.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.3.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.4.
1.5.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.5.
1.5.2.3. Pro: A large-scale national study suggests low to moderate use of marijuana is [less harmful](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/01/11282/marijuana-shown-be-less-damaging-lungs-tobacco) to users’ lungs than exposure to tobacco, even though the two substances contain many of the same components.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: Tobacco contains [nicotine](https://patients4medicalmarijuana.wordpress.com/marijuana-info/marijuana-vs-cigarettes/), and marijuana does not. Nicotine may harden the arteries and may be responsible for much of the heart disease caused by smoking cigarettes.
1.5.2.3.2. Pro: Smoking marijuana [does not cause lung cancer](http://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/news/20060523/pot-smoking-not-linked-to-lung-cancer#1), while smoking cigarettes does.
1.5.2.3.2.1. Con: Some studies have [disputed](https://www.verywell.com/does-smoking-marijuana-cause-lung-cancer-2248991) this idea; there is not yet a clear consensus on the risk of cancer for marijuana users.
1.5.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.4.5.4.
1.5.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.4.5.2.
1.5.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.9.
1.5.2.6. Pro: Marijuana can be beneficial to those who use it.
1.5.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.4.
1.5.2.6.2. Pro: Marijuana aids relaxation, which improves health and well-being.
1.5.2.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.3.
1.5.2.6.2.2. Pro: Marijuana is a way to cope with [social anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1986747/).
1.5.2.6.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.4.5.
1.5.2.6.4. Con: Smoking marijuana reduces [neurocognitive performance](http://www.neurology.org/content/59/9/1337.short), such as psychomotor ability. This is particularly dangerous in traffic.
1.5.2.6.4.1. Con: Cannabis has no effect on the ability to [ride a bike](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00414-015-1307-y).
1.5.2.6.5. Con: It is possible to legalise marijuana for medical purposes without having to decriminalise it for personal consumption.
1.5.2.7. Con: We should assess the reasonableness of hard drugs based on their own merits and health effects, not in comparison to other substances.
1.5.3. Con: Marijuana is a gateway drug to harder drugs like heroin.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Sewage water samples indicate that hard drugs are used [more often](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/28/world/europe/wastewater-drug-tests/index.html?hpt=hp_t3) in the Netherlands than in other European countries.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: [London](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/04/cocaine-london-sewers-highest-level-europe-drug-uk) seems to have more traces of cocaine in its sewers than Amsterdam.
1.5.3.2. Pro: [Studies](http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB6010/index1.html) have shown that marijuana use increases the likelihood of using hard drugs later.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Consuming soft drugs like marijuana [increases](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol20/vol20_iss10/record2010.24.html) the risk of becoming a cocaine addict.
1.5.3.2.2. Con: It has been shown in multiple studies that marijuana is not really a gateway drug to harder drugs.
1.5.3.2.2.1. Pro: [Research suggests](http://healthland.time.com/2010/10/29/marijuna-as-a-gateway-drug-the-myth-that-will-not-die/) that though marijuana users are more likely than non-users to use harder drugs, this is because those people are more likely to try drugs in general and not because marijuana is a gateway.
1.5.3.2.2.2. Pro: The [National Institute on Drug Abuse](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-gateway-drug) say that the majority of marijuana users do not take harder drugs later in life.
1.5.3.2.3. Con: The [DPRC research](http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB6010/index1.html) demonstrates that the phenomena supporting claims that marijuana is a gateway drug also support the alternative explanation: that it is not marijuana use but individuals' opportunities and unique propensities to use drugs that determine their risk of initiating hard drugs.
1.5.3.2.3.1. Con: The research does not disprove the gateway theory; it merely shows that another explanation is plausible.
1.5.3.3. Con: -> See 1.5.3.2.2.
1.5.3.4. Pro: Once the taboo against drug use is broken you are much more likely to try other drugs as well as marijuana.
1.5.3.4.1. Con: Breaking the taboo against drugs has only shown a decrease in drug use.
1.5.3.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.7.
1.5.3.5. Con: Nearly [half](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/6-facts-about-marijuana/) of Americans tried marijuana at least once but this did not translate into frequent use of strong drugs. Statistics on [heroin](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/heroin-addiction/faq/addicted-first-time/), for example, show that only a fraction of Americans make use of it.
1.5.3.6. Pro: Dealers that sell soft and hard drugs would try to push users to the more lucrative drugs, namely hard drugs, which also make them more addicted.
1.5.4. Pro: Uruguay's government sells a gram of cannabis for [$1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/06/uruguay-marijuana-regulat_n_5276097.html), which has had a major impact on drug traffickers.
1.5.4.1. Con: The black market in Uruguay has [expanded](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-05-08/uruguay-struggling-make-legal-weed-can-compete-illegal-stuff) since legalisation, with the number of growers doubling within a year.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: The [vast majority](http://www.thecannabist.co/2016/07/06/uruguay-marijuana-pharmacies/57627/) of pharmacies in Uruguay have refused to sell state-sponsored marijuana due to safety concerns. This has left the market in the hands of illegal growers.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Con: The government could presumably force pharmacies to sell these drugs. This problem is not inherent to the policy.
1.5.4.1.1.2. Con: There would likely be fewer safety concerns if this policy was in countries with lower rates of criminal violence.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Most home-growers are [reluctant](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/13/uruguay-marijuana-cannabis-market-sale-legitmacy) to register with the government, leaving a large proportion of the market unregulated.
1.5.4.2. Pro: The low official price of marijuana has [driven down black market prices](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-05-08/uruguay-struggling-make-legal-weed-can-compete-illegal-stuff) from local growers, undercutting traffickers.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.1.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Government controlled selling of drugs eliminates a source of revenue for organized crime.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Governments would be able to sell the drugs more cheaply as they could run at a loss.
1.5.4.3.2. Con: Some people will still go through unofficial channels to get their drugs.
1.5.4.3.2.1. Pro: Those who are already indebted to drug cartels will be forced to continue to buy from them.
1.5.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: Cartels give drug users lower price drugs initially to get them hooked and then force addicts to pay back the money through [trafficking](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/the-downward-spiral-of-indebted-drug-addicts-1.2537158) for fear of the consequences.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2. Con: As most individuals will not be connected to drug cartels, they will likely buy their drugs from local street drug dealers.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.1. Con: A large number of these local [street dealers](http://www.npr.org/2016/02/15/466491812/narconomics-how-the-drug-cartels-operate-like-wal-mart-and-mcdonalds) are [connected](http://www.kevindeutsch.us/blog/bloods-crips-and-cartels-how-american-street-gangs-work-mexican-narco-kings-flood-us-streets) to [cartels](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/02/05/gang-warfare-on-streets-chicago-fueled-by-sinaloa-cartel-heroin.html). If money is owed to these street dealers, money will ultimately be owed to drug cartels.
1.5.4.3.2.2. Pro: Organised crime can produce lower quality drugs at a lower price. If someone is addicted, they are unlikely to be able to care and, once they are high, unable to tell the difference.
1.5.4.3.2.2.1. Con: The fact that someone is an addict does not mean that they cannot assess quality and decide who to buy from.
1.5.4.3.2.2.2. Con: This may only be true because criminals are not in direct competition with companies. It is entirely plausible that a pharmaceutical company could put a cartel out of business if they were.
1.5.4.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.2.
1.5.4.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: Pharmaceutical companies have extensive production, distribution and marketing infrastructure already set up; it will be very easy for them to move into the market for recreational drugs.
1.5.4.3.2.2.2.3. Pro: The legalization of marijuana in some [US states](http://www.leafscience.com/2014/04/11/marijuana-legalization-hurts-organized-crime/) has turned drug trafficking into a loss-making business.
1.5.4.3.2.2.3. Pro: In order to increase their profit, dealers [stretch](http://www.new-hope-recovery.com/center/2014/10/17/meth-ingredients-toxic-chemicals-used-in-making-crystal-meth-2/) drugs with dangerous chemicals that cannot be easily detected.
1.5.4.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: Because drugs are often connected to heavy money-laundering, drug dealers are always on the lookout for ways to make the most money off the least amount of pure drugs.
1.5.4.3.2.2.4. Con: Drugs produced at higher purities mean you need to consume less to get an equivalent high. In this way even high quality drugs can be more cost effective for consumers.
1.5.4.3.2.2.4.1. Con: The vast majority of the cost of drugs is in the active ingredient not the filler \(hence why fillers are used\). As a result, the price for an equivalent high would be similar.
1.5.4.3.2.2.5. Pro: In addition, criminal organizations do not pay tax, which helps to maintain low prices.
1.5.4.3.2.3. Pro: People will still feel stigmatised for consuming their drugs and will not want it on an official record.
1.5.4.3.2.3.1. Con: The legal status of drugs would not necessitate putting their purchase on an official record. This is not currently the case for pornography and would not need to be for drugs.
1.5.4.3.2.4. Pro: People who are addicted to drugs are likely to be naturally suspicious of governments. They would likely fear the potential of the government to inappropriately use the knowledge of drug use in future.
1.5.4.3.2.4.1. Pro: For example, if the government were to change policy in the future and criminalise the drug use, there would be a fear of retrospective justice.
1.5.4.3.2.4.1.1. Con: Retrospective laws are [prohibited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law) in most countries around the world, so this fear would be minimal, if not non-existent.
1.5.4.3.2.4.2. Pro: If the user were paranoid, they might fear that the police would simply arrest them on some other charge in order to get around the legality of drugs.
1.5.4.3.2.4.3. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.3.1.
1.5.4.3.2.5. Pro: Even if drugs are legal, their consumption may negatively affect their chances of employment in some sectors \(such as aviation or emergency services\).
1.5.4.3.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.3.1.
1.5.4.3.2.6. Con: The routes of organized crime are too expensive and thus would need to be given up.
1.5.4.3.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.2.
1.5.4.3.2.6.2. Pro: [Submarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narco-submarine) were used to smuggle cocaine. This is very complicated and expensive compared to regular shipping.
1.5.4.3.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.2.2.3.
1.5.4.3.3. Con: -> See 1.5.4.1.1.
1.5.4.3.4. Pro: One of the consequences of Maastricht's [ban on sales](https://glassroomglobe.com/2016/03/25/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-paradox-of-drug-tourism/) for foreign tourists was more street dealing. This indicates that decriminalization eradicates income for criminals.
1.5.4.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.3.
1.5.4.3.6. Con: A legal market for drugs does not eliminate organized crime. Criminals have the necessary network and transport routes and would not stop using them.
1.5.4.3.6.1. Con: Even if it did not destroy the cartels, it would at least be a source of competition which would reduce their revenue significantly.
1.5.4.3.6.1.1. Pro: It is unlikely that organized crime would be as successful as companies like Roche and Bayer at producing, quality assuring, marketing and selling drugs.
1.5.4.3.6.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.2.
1.5.4.3.6.1.1.2. Con: [Drug cartels'](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/how-much-are-mexico-s-brutal-drug-cartels-worth-1.1333213) revenue is bigger or at least comparable to that of [pharma companies.](http://www.annualreport2016.bayer.com/)
1.5.4.3.6.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.2.2.
1.5.4.3.6.1.1.3. Pro: Drug companies have an immense advantage in being able to hire experts in each area; almost all of whom would not want to work for cartels.
1.5.4.3.6.1.1.4. Con: It is unclear why these huge drug companies start producing recreational drugs, especially under the consideration that \(most\) recreational drugs likely create a niche market only.
1.5.4.3.6.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.6.
1.5.4.3.6.3. Pro: Drug dealers and gangs will be able to hide their illegal activity more easily when drugs are legalised.
1.5.4.3.6.3.1. Pro: When drugs are legal, it is harder to ascertain the source of drugs as you can no longer question individuals who are using them.
1.5.4.3.6.3.1.1. Con: There are dozens of steps between an individual drug user and the top of the supply chain. Questioning users is not a very effective way of combating cartel activity.
1.5.4.3.6.4. Pro: Gangs and cartels could easily move into the legal market for drugs, particularly if regulations on production and distribution are lacking.
1.5.4.3.6.4.1. Pro: Even when a profession is legal, organized crime will infiltrate it, as the involvement of the [Camorra](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2730494/Is-Aberdeen-really-new-home-feared-Mafia-group-EU-report-says-Camorra-controls-catering-food-retail-property-Scottish-city.html) in business illustrates. Thus, making drugs legal does not automatically break up the structures of these groups.
1.5.4.3.6.5. Con: Most people are not criminals and if given a choice, would prefer to participate in the legal market vs black/grey market. The profit motive for organized crime to stay in the market would be greatly reduced. While "bootlegging" alcohol does exist to some extent currently, it is largely due to private craft beer production and trade and not in an effort to reap profit by producing an otherwise unobtainable product.
1.5.4.3.6.6. Pro: Most of the [major organized crime groups](http://fortune.com/2014/09/14/biggest-organized-crime-groups-in-the-world/) in the world are involved in the drug trade. A government allowing drug use and import cannot easily break up their structures.
1.5.4.3.6.6.1. Con: The legalization and regulation of alcohol would suggest that when a government-sanctioned alternative is provided, prices drop and people will choose the "mainstream" over bootlegged.
1.5.4.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.2.
1.5.5. Pro: The legalization of drugs has improved the lives of [women](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/uruguay-marijuana-legalization-one-year-later/) who often worked as the weakest link in the drug supply chain and became imprisoned the easiest as traffickers or street dealers.
1.5.5.1. Pro: The female prison population has fallen from [7.9% to 5.8%](http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/uruguay) following legalisation.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: There is no concrete evidence that this is due to the new drug policy. The information shows a decrease in female prison population, and this can be due to a myriad of co-occurring factors, not necessarily because of a change in the legal status of drugs.
1.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.5.8. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.4.5.
1.5.9. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.6.
1.5.10. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.5.11. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.5.12. Pro: The price of drugs is expensive, lowering the price decreases the likelihood for people to profit, which lowers peer-pressure and pill -pushing.
1.5.13. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.3.
1.5.14. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.2.
1.5.15. Pro: Decriminalizing drugs is safer for law enforcement. The number of criminals is drastically reduced. The high marketability drops and the number of gangs able to militarize their operation lowers too as profits dwindle. The police do not have to militarize to keep up or suspect everyone in a drug laden neighborhood.
1.5.15.1. Pro: It will reduce citizens unwanted encounters with the police. Friction between police and individuals in black communities will lessen.
1.6. Legalise all drugs, requiring each purchase to be accompanied by a test to ensure the consent and health of the consumer.
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.6.2. Pro: Countries would reap socio-economic benefit from the legalisation of drugs.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Ending the War on Drugs would benefit the countries where the fight against traffickers and cartels is most active.
1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Narcotrafficking is financing parties involved in [civil wars](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/drug-trafficking-and-the-financing-of-terrorism.html) and militant groups like [ISIS](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/isis-al-qaeda-drugs-trafficking-cartels-heroin-terrorism-a7684961.html).
1.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: Investigators suspect that ISIS may be [taxing](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/italy-morocco-isis-drug-trade.html) the movement of drugs through their territory.
1.6.2.1.1.2. Con: The claim that drugs are funding ISIS has been [challenged by experts](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ppvgw8/is-the-drug-trade-really-bank-rolling-terrorists) and is not backed up by solid evidence.
1.6.2.1.2. Pro: Countries like Mexico could end their gruesome cartel fights.
1.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: Since 2006 hundreds of thousands of Mexicans have [been killed or gone missing](https://www.ncronline.org/news/global/counting-mexicos-drug-victims-murky-business).
1.6.2.1.3. Con: Ending the War on Drugs would not decrease the control and influence the cartels have over these countries.
1.6.2.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.6.
1.6.2.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.6.1.1.
1.6.2.2. Pro: A legal market for drugs will reduce revenue for organized crime.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.4.
1.6.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.3.
1.6.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.6.1.1.
1.6.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.
1.6.2.2.5. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.6.
1.6.2.2.6. Pro: Despite the fact that recreational cannabis is only legal in seven US states, it is already [making Mexican drug cartels poorer](https://www.vox.com/2015/12/31/10694644/marijuana-legalization-winning).
1.6.2.2.6.1. Con: The loss of marijuana sales for Mexican cartels since laws were loosened in the US has encouraged cartels to [push harder drugs instead](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/losing-marijuana-business-mexican-cartels-push-heroin-and-meth/2015/01/11/91fe44ce-8532-11e4-abcf-5a3d7b3b20b8_story.html?utm_term=.23c671544e56).
1.6.2.2.6.1.1. Con: This is all the more reason that these drugs should also be legalised, undercutting cartel activity further.
1.6.2.2.7. Con: Drug cartels are now involved in [a range of illicit activities](http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/06/22/legalizing-drugs-wont-stop-mexicos-brutal-cartels/) and not only in drug trafficking. Legalising drugs will not end cartel activity.
1.6.2.2.7.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.6.1.
1.6.2.2.8. Pro: Legalization of all drugs would lead to reduction in violent gangs selling drugs, because legitimate businessmen could fill the same market demand without needing a framework of thugs.
1.6.2.2.9. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.6.2.3. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.6.3. Pro: Consenting adults should be able to self-determine their lives. If they want to take drugs, even after they know all the risks and consequences, it is their right to do so.
1.6.3.1. Pro: This is no different from tobacco or alcohol consumption which also has significant personal ramifications.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: People affected by harder drugs tend to become much more violent and dangerous to other people than when consuming tobacco or alcohol.
1.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.2.
1.6.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.1.2.
1.6.3.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.4.1.
1.6.3.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.2.5.
1.6.3.1.1.5. Pro: Synthetic drugs including so-called bath salts can cause '[bizarre and violent behavior](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3517997/The-science-bath-salts-Experts-reveal-dark-compounds-synthetic-street-drugs-cause-bizarre-violent-behaviour.html)' as well as [paranoia](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/synthetic-cathinones-bath-salts).
1.6.3.1.1.5.1. Con: Those synthetic drugs are cheap and sometimes semi-legal substances supposed to [substitute traditional drugs](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/synthetic-cathinones-bath-salts) like marijuana or cocaine. Therefore, the current drug policy is, at least partially, responsible for the rise of those drugs.
1.6.3.1.1.6. Con: MDMA \(ecstasy\) - a relatively popular drug for recreational use - causes a contrary effect: it increases '[emotional empathy and prosocial behavior](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24097374)'.
1.6.3.1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.4.3.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.2.4.4.
1.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.1.
1.6.3.3. Pro: A license test would likely contain a safety check by a physician. This would guarantee that adults are physically safe to take drugs.
1.6.3.3.1. Con: This assumes that doctors are capable of determining whether or not a person is physically fit to take drugs. However, the reasons why someone should not receive drugs are not necessarily immediately apparent.
1.6.3.3.1.1. Con: Even a limited test is preferable to the complete absence of checks on illegal drug use in the status quo.
1.6.3.3.1.1.1. Con: This would be true if the proposed policy did not drastically increase the number of people taking drugs. But the actual comparison is a small number of people taking drugs without regulation versus a much larger group with a largely ineffective check.
1.6.3.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.3.3.1.2. Con: Doctors have the knowledge and experience to know the likely problems for a potential drug user - for example, pre-existing conditions - and the resources to test for them. In most cases, the reasons to limit someone's access to drugs will become apparent.
1.6.3.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.3.
1.6.3.3.2. Con: If the test is performed before every sale, it would be a huge administrative burden which could lead to some tests being done improperly.
1.6.3.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.6.
1.6.3.3.4. Con: Doctors could be bribed to hand out such a license in inappropriate circumstances.
1.6.3.3.4.1. Con: Doctors handing out a few licenses when they should not is still better than anyone being able to access illegal drugs on the street. Even if this system is not perfect, it is still far better than no regulation at all.
1.6.3.3.4.2. Con: Such instances will be few, if any, as doctors would not want to be caught and have their license stripped.
1.6.3.3.4.2.1. Pro: If someone did suffer after consuming a drug, the doctor that authorised the license would be the one of the first people the police would question. There is little incentive for doctors to take this risk.
1.6.3.3.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.6.3.
1.6.3.3.4.3. Con: If this were the case, then the doctor would be acting against the law. The same can happen today with medical marijuana, but does not happen that often.
1.6.3.3.5. Con: There are [a number of doctors](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/health/in-demand-in-clinics-and-on-the-street-bupe-can-be-savior-or-menace.html) that prescribe opiates to patients that are highly addicted and should rather go to rehab.
1.6.3.4. Pro: A drug licence test makes sure users are aware of the fatal consequences of irresponsible use.
1.6.3.4.1. Pro: Drug dealers in the illegal market have very little incentive to warn customers of the dangers of illegal drugs.
1.6.3.4.1.1. Pro: The aim of total legalisation is that people wouldn't buy their drugs from these illegal sources but would instead go through regulated channels which would provide this information and test.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: Legalization would lead to better quality drugs as a regulated industry would appear.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Legalising drugs does not guarantee that the quality of the drugs supplied is high.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.2.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Legalisation would likely come alongside regulation and oversight, to ensure that the quality is high enough to be safe.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: If someone were to suffer from adverse effects after consuming a legally produced drug, the producing company would be held liable. This legal recourse would act as sufficient deterrence to legal drug producing companies from trying to cut corners.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.6.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Measures to improve the world must not be blocked by them not having a 100% watertight guarantee of success. Even a 50% increase in quality is a step in the right direction.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.1.5. Con: Marijuana is [fairly easy](http://herb.co/2016/05/21/laced-weed/) to check for quality.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.1.6. Con: [Pill testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pill_testing) is an easy tool to identify the quality of a drug.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Drugs would be more consistent in their composition so overdoses would be less likely.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The format in which the product is sold could then ensure the concentration per dose which would mitigate the risk of administrating an improper quantity by error.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.3. Pro: The drugs would not be contaminated with harmful substances, which is one of the main risks of drug usage.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.2.3.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Impurities and contaminations are a huge health risk for drug users today.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: If drugs are close to [100% purity](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-39929619), they are extremely dangerous and potentially lethal.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: High purity is only dangerous because users do not know the strength of the drugs they are taking, and therefore take too much. Under a legal, regulated market, users would know the exact strength and purity of whatever they were taking and these deaths would not happen.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.3.3.1.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.3.3.2.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.3.2.4. Pro: Dealers are known for "testing" their impure drugs on desperate consumers who cannot afford to pay for them. This puts these addicts in great danger.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.3.2.5. Pro: [Ecstasy](http://www.recoveryplace.com/blog/the-danger-of-impure-street-drugs/) is easily disguised with other substances, leaving users blind to its potential side effects. Some pills may contain little or no MDMA and instead are composed of other drugs such as ketamine, amphetamine, caffeine and ephedrine.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.4. Pro: Users would be more likely to seek out a regulated supplier if possible as they would trust it to be more safe for them.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.2.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.2.
1.6.3.4.1.1.1.6. Con: The legal liability of the distributor or producer is somewhat unclear regarding unknown adverse health effect of a product.
1.6.3.4.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.
1.6.3.4.1.2. Con: First and foremost drug dealers are businessmen. As such, they have a vital interest to maintain a large pool of healthy customers.
1.6.3.4.1.2.1. Con: This doesn't necessarily mean they have to keep their customers healthy, simply that they need to be able to keep a large pool of customers.
1.6.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.5.
1.6.3.6. Con: It is difficult to accurately assess the consent of a person to use drugs.
1.6.3.6.1. Pro: In a short space of time, it is difficult to know exactly why the individual wants to buy the drugs.
1.6.3.6.1.1. Con: The reason someone wants to buy drugs should not be a doctor's concern; their only priority should be whether it is safe for the person to do so.
1.6.3.6.1.2. Pro: Without the knowledge of why a person wants to take drugs, it is impossible to evaluate their ability to consent to taking them.
1.6.3.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.3.2.
1.6.3.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.1.
1.6.3.6.4. Pro: Consent in drug use can be seriously impacted by mental health, which is not always possible to assess accurately.
1.6.3.6.4.1. Pro: Testing methods for mental health issues are [diverse](http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-assessment#1) and rely on the [psychologist's choice](http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/assessment.aspx) of methods and interpretation of the results. This makes it hard to standardise the assessment.
1.6.3.6.4.1.1. Con: National health services have established standards on how to assess mental health, such as in the [UK](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/AboutNHSservices/mental-health-services-explained/Pages/your-mental-health-assessment.aspx).
1.6.3.6.4.2. Pro: Certain intelligent people with a mental illness \(e.g. sociopaths, psychopaths\) may be able to pass a standardized mental stability test.
1.6.3.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.
1.6.3.8. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.
1.6.3.9. Con: Even if drug users consent to use drugs, those around them do not consent to the damaging effects of drug use on their own lives and society.
1.6.3.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.
1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.5.
1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.4.5.
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.4.1.1.1.
1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.6.8. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.6.10. Pro: This would help create a better system to regulate what drugs are being used and create rules on to how much is healthy to consume.
1.6.11. Pro: The legalisation of drugs would be beneficial for drug addicts.
1.6.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.6.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.
1.6.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.3.
1.6.11.4. Con: This has to be viewed relatively: even if we help current addicts, this could be worse in the long term if more people become addicted.
1.6.11.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.11.5. Con: Drug addicts have made a bad decision that has plenty of obvious warnings surrounding it.
1.6.11.6. Pro: John Marks developed a drug program in Liverpool where he simply supplied addicts with pure drugs in sustainable dosages. He had fathers and husbands living with addiction and holding full time jobs. When the government shut him down, addicts returned to the streets. 20 were dead within 6 months. \(from Chasing the Scream by Johann Hari pp.206-215\)
1.6.11.7. Pro: Without regulations on any substance, self-medication would be accessible to those who currently cannot receive treatment by licensed professionals.
1.6.11.7.1. Con: Medication requires expert knowledge. Accessibility of drugs as methods of treatment should remain competence of professionals.
1.6.11.7.1.1. Pro: Predicting how human organism will react to particular substance requires research that may be conducted only by qualified team of specialists.
1.6.11.7.1.2. Pro: Misinformation about some substances may occur. A person without expert knowledge is unable to test which information is true.
1.6.11.7.1.3. Pro: People might take drugs without realising dangerous side effects.
1.6.11.8. Con: Without regulations on any substance, addicts would not need to fear imprisonment or other punishment for getting help, thus making treatment for addiction more accessible.
1.6.12. Con: Meaningful tests of "health and consent" would be impractically expensive.
1.6.12.1. Con: The costs of health and consent testing would be far outweighed by the saving through legitimate regulation and taxation.
1.6.13. Pro: People being treated as responsible allows personal freedom, which endorses civil rights, eg the Bill of Rights as a whole [according to the 1st Amendment.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment)
1.6.13.1. Con: Giving people individual responsibility from the time of their birth allows for a large amount of error and immoral activity \(manslaughter, theft, vandalism\) as per [ncadd.org](https://www.ncadd.org/about-addiction/alcohol-drugs-and-crime)
1.6.13.1.1. Con: Allowing room for error allows an individual to grow as a person. When a person is prevented from making poor decisions then they have no incentive to improve their ability to make decisions in the future.
1.6.13.1.2. Con: This error would happen no matter what, but with personal responsibility, responsibility for the consequences of the error fall only on the person who made it, whereas with collective responsibility, the entire collective must take responsibility for and pay the consequences of individual error. E.g. drug addicts being imprisoned imposes high costs on taxpayers.
1.6.13.2. Pro: Mentally stable adults would use drugs in a responsible way in the same way that they do with alcohol.
1.6.13.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.6.13.2.2. Con: It is practically impossible to use a highly mind-altering substance 'responsibly'.
1.6.13.2.2.1. Pro: Flakka, a synthetic drug, causes [violent and antisocial](http://www.newsmax.com/Health/Health-News/flakka-drug-crazed-overdose/2015/04/16/id/638865/) behaviour. It is also extremely easy to take too much by accident.
1.6.13.2.2.2. Pro: Drugs can induce [psychosis](http://www.dualdiagnosis.org/drug-addiction/psychosis/).
1.6.13.2.2.3. Con: Alcohol also alters one's mental state. However a large portion of society consumes it responsibly.
1.6.13.2.2.3.1. Con: Alcohol does not alter one's mental state nearly as much as recreational drugs.
1.6.13.2.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.2.
1.6.13.2.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.1.
1.6.13.2.2.6. Con: Most drugs have a long history of responsible use within their historical context.
1.6.13.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.9.2.
1.6.13.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.4.1.1.
1.6.13.2.5. Pro: There are [many drug users](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/09/10/jonathan-caulkins/responsible-drug-use-possible) in society that already use drugs responsibly.
1.6.14. Pro: Legalization would remove legislative barriers that discourage scientific research on drugs.
1.6.15. Pro: Decriminalization of drugs will dramatically reduce the violence associated with the drug trade. If not illegal, drug distributors are not at odds with law enforcement. Without conflict, there is no violence.
1.6.15.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.15.
1.6.15.2. Pro: If drugs were not illegal distributors could call the police if someone attempts theft of their product and they could ensure their product. Legal drug manufacturers and distributors do not get into gunfights with thieves.
1.6.15.3. Pro: With decriminalization murder associated with the theft or attempted theft of drugs will be minuscule compared to present day. It will approximate the degree of murder associated with thefts or attempted thefts of other businesses.
1.6.15.4. Pro: The costs associated with of stopping and punishing thieves is shared by all of society, distributors don't have to employ their own protection which is inherently violent since it must be secret for them to continue with their business.
1.6.16. Pro: Elimination of all regulations related to substances would reduce the cost of medication due to lower barrier to entry for manufacturers.
1.6.16.1. Con: The elimination of the existing testing and approval process would lower the quality and safety of drugs which people rely on for medication. It would result in a market flooded with dangerous, unsafe, and untested substances without any reliable source of information or standards for consumers.
1.6.17. Pro: -> See 1.6.11.7.
1.6.18. Con: It is harder to crack down on cartel activity when drugs are legal.
1.6.18.1. Con: -> See 1.6.3.4.1.1.1.4.
1.6.18.2. Con: -> See 1.6.2.2.
1.6.18.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.6.3.1.
1.6.18.4. Pro: It is more difficult to portray the cartels as bad when a large part of their activities are now legitimised under the guise of 'legality'.
1.7. Abolish all laws and regulations on any narcotic drug. Treat people as responsible beings.
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.11.7.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.11.
1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.2.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.15.
1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.4.1.1.1.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.
1.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.13.
1.7.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.7.9. Pro: -> See 1.6.14.
1.7.10. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.7.11. Pro: -> See 1.6.16.
1.7.12. Con: -> See 1.4.5.
1.7.13. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.7.14. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.8. Decriminalisation of production, trade, and consumption of all drugs, while introducing high taxes.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.3.
1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.4.5.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.4.
1.8.6. Pro: The notion that only alcohol, tobacco and caffeine can be used responsibly \(and by responsible individuals\) is patently false.
1.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.15.
1.8.8. Con: "High" taxes could still be viewed as a punitive expression of moral disapproval.
1.9. Legalise drug use and manufacture imposing significant taxes on sales which is fed directly into recovery and rehabilitation services and public education. All users are subject to the full consequences of their action \(or non-action in the case of marijuana users hehe\) while affected.
1.9.1. Pro: If using a substance is legal, the individual is more likely to avoid crossing the line to engaging in the often associated anti-social behaviours.
1.9.2. Pro: The legal availability and use of substances is unlikely to increase the current or potential user pool. The same numbers of those deterred or undeterred by non-illegal negatives such as poor health or potential death, addiction and behaviour \(making a public idiot of yourself\) would be maintained.
1.9.3. Pro: When drugs are legal it is all the more important that drug users understand their own need that they accept the full consequences of their behaviour.  The development of thinking that attempts avoid consequence penalties was the exact sign of addiction developing.
1.9.4. Con: \(Sometimes marijuana uses can take normal action, but first it is required that they discern accurately the difference between their imaginations and reality, and that is clinically proven to be harder whilst marijuana effected\) Many drugs that are used as recreation substances today, have traditionally been thought of as only safe if supervised by somebody willing accept responsibility for the user, as if the user a child. That standard is the safest possible pattern of drug use.
1.10. A consistent evidence based approach, legalising all non harmful non addictive drugs, and criminalising the rest. \(Potentially legalising consuming cannabis, but banning smoking tobacco\)
1.10.1. Pro: A government should protect its populace from harm \(especially in circumstances such as addiction when the populace can't help itself\).
1.10.1.1. Con: Treating one person's addiction should not interfere with another person's autonomy.
1.10.2. Pro: Scientific evidence is the most successful discriminator of fact and fiction we have.
1.10.3. Pro: A government should not restrict its population's access to things that harm neither individuals nor society.
1.10.4. Con: If adults want to take drugs that harm them they should be able to.
1.10.4.1. Con: Addiction often removes people's power to choose, they should be protected from this
1.10.4.1.1. Con: People should have the freedom to do things that are bad for them as long as they are not harming others.
1.10.5. Pro: Governments can save money by decriminalising drugs \(both through taxes, and saving on law enforcement\).
1.10.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.4.
1.10.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.10.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.3.
1.10.6. Con: Prohibition is [generally inferior](http://www.drugsense.org/probreg.htm) to regulation as a mechanism to manage risk. It should not be applied to any substance.
1.10.6.1. Con: Prohibition effectively protects the public from many substances, including, but not limited to, chemical weapons \(chlorine & nerve gas\), biological weapons \(anthrax\)
1.10.6.1.1. Con: These are not substances anyone would knowingly choose to ingest and are therefore not in the same class as the substances under discussion.
1.10.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.14.
1.10.8. Con: Such a system would be susceptible to manipulation by interested stakeholders.
1.11. Legalise all drugs and regulate each drug according to its unique risks and benefits. Regulation should keep a balance between the interests of the consumer and the safety of the consumer in the same way as regulation of medicines, electricity, gas, transport, sports, fire and any other source of risk with benefit.
1.11.1. Con: The process of gaining scientific knowledge of the "unique benefits and risks" of each drug, is not yet being well funded in Western Medical Science, and therefore the greater knowledge is still held by various disparate indigenous groups seldom heeded by nation states.
1.11.2. Con: Much of the funding to learn of the "unique benefits and risks" might be from "big pharma", who might have their own vested interests not always aligned with drug users.
1.11.3. Pro: It is enabling of the least potential harm connected with drug use, to think of drugs as alike to other factors in the economy, such as electricity, gas, transport, fire etc.
1.11.3.1. Con: Most goods and services in the economy are not addictive in the same way as drugs are \(external source of psychoactive substance\).
1.11.4. Pro: Governments need accept their responsibilities rather than simply making any substance illegal when they find that substance too hard to write appropriate laws about.
1.11.5. Pro: Developing a written record of the unique risks and benefits of each drug, may enable and honour indigenous knowledge systems.
1.11.6. Con: Traditionally indigenous knowledge of many drugs, was inclusive of the know how that the benefits of each plant medicine can better be communicated than the risks.  Because when the risks were communicated, those risks increased, while when only the benefits were being communicated, risk diminished.
1.11.7. Con: Regulating numerous drugs, that are first legalized leaves the State with almost no power over the demand and supply, after they are legal. So is the situation with cigarettes, which have been proven to be highly unhealthy \(causing increase in costs of healthcare\) and so addictive, that any regulations concerning these had almost no impact. The more addictive the substance, the lower elasticity of the demand, and the lower effects of any regulation.
1.12. Legalize the consumption and possession of narcotics. Regulate daily purchase amounts. Trafficking narcotics is highly punishable. Unlawfully manufacturing narcotics is highly punishable. Redirect funds previously spent criminalization to individual well being. Regulate minimum age to 21. Public consumption and vehicle operation remain punishable. Failure to adhere to any of these circumstances results in education and awareness \(like traffic school\).
