Discussion Title: Should Journalists Publish Hacked Data?

1. Journalists should not publish any information that was obtained by hacking.
1.1. Con: Journalists can use their judgement in choosing what information to report on and exercising such discretion is a standard part of journalistic ethics.
1.1.1. Con: It is hard for journalists to assess whether leaks have been edited or falsified because they have nothing to compare the leaked information with.
1.1.1.1. Con: The nature of the leaked information should be highlighted in articles written about it, to ensure readers understand whether it is uncorroborated or not.
1.1.1.2. Con: This is not always the case - sometimes leaked information is confirmed by other sources, or confirms other, already known, information.
1.1.2. Pro: Journalists should have the right to do so, but at their own peril. Many tabloids print bald faced lies, in the name of entertainment, while hiding behind anonymous sources. Everyone expects that of tabloids, but recently, these tactics have spilled into the 24/7 Cable News cycle. Whether or not to publish depends on how seriously journalists want to potentially damage their credibility with their audience.
1.1.3. Pro: Journalists are a key part of our democratic system: they inform both how we are governed and our values and beliefs. If this information is in the public domain, then we need them alongside side us providing a democratising function.
1.1.4. Pro: The legality or illegality of how data was acquired does not have any bearing whatsoever on whether it should be publicly known. That decision must be made on the pros and cons of publishing it. In other words, does publishing it do more good \(public awareness of an issue\) than harm \(revelation of secret some would prefer remain secret\).
1.1.4.1. Pro: If the material was hacked, and was hidden for malicious purposes, the information needs to be released to the public. If it was supposed to be hidden \(i.e. the identity of a French spy investigating terrorist groups\) than it most remain a secret.
1.1.5. Con: In the case of information that might be harmful to the public, journalists should consult with the  appropriate \(legal\) authorities. Authorities might have better insight on the topic, therefore they can warn the journalist about possible consequences, which would otherwise not be fully considered by the journalist alone.
1.1.6. Con: Individual journalists should not act as moral arbiters for all of society.
1.1.6.1. Con: It is the public's judgement upon the released information that acts as the moral arbiter, not the journalist.
1.1.6.2. Con: The role of the media is to hold powerful actors to account: they need to act as moral arbiters because they are the ones best-placed to do so.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: There is nothing in the media's corporate charters that dictate that purpose. The purpose by law is to maximize profit.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: Corporate media entities already are powerful actors; forming oligopolies with large amounts of control over the media landscape in many cases.
1.1.6.3. Pro: Individual journalists are incapable of acting as moral arbiters for all of society, because as \(mostly\) employees of the corporate media industry they have little autonomy. Corporations by design do not allow judgement:, they are rule based systems which by law must maximize profits. They are the amoral arbiters for society.
1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.1.8. Pro: Journalists should not consider where the information originates from, unless it impacts the credibility, when making the decision to publish it.
1.1.8.1. Con: The origin of information always impacts its credibility. There is no other reliable way to gauge why that particular piece of information has come to light at any given time.
1.1.8.2. Con: Protections on privacy and on other priviledged information are important to a well-ordered society. Journalists who publish hacked information encourage and profit from the hackers' bad behavior. We all have less privacy and are less secure when journalists publish hacked material.
1.1.8.3. Pro: The act of choosing to hide information does not mean that this information should not be public.
1.1.8.3.1. Pro: The [Paradise Papers](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/08/key-revelations-from-the-paradise-papers) revealed potential corruption amongst the political elite from all over the world.
1.1.8.4. Pro: Given sources will often fiercely defend their anonymity it is not always possible to determine if a source obtained the information legally \(i.e. as a whistleblower\) or through "hacking." Thus concern about the legality of the information obtained may have a chilling effect on journalists' decisions to publish information from whistleblowers.
1.1.8.4.1. Con: While keeping sources anonymous may be key to the development of certain stories, use of anonymous sources should be used only rarely and with great care. Whether the source is anonymous or not, the journalist has an ethical obligation to investigate the story rigorously and ensure its accuracy. Unless there is a very good reason to choose otherwise, sources should be revealed. The resulting transparency ensures the story's accuracy and heightens the story's credibility.
1.1.8.5. Pro: Governments write the rules and regulations which keep information private. The incentive of political parties is to keep damaging information secret when they are in power, this distorts the democratic process.
1.1.8.5.1. Pro: The [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court) \(US\) does not permit the public to view or access records of its hearings, and so the public were not aware of the [NSA's powers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order) until the Snowden leaks.
1.1.8.5.2. Con: Governments have a democratic mandate to protect sensitive information and conduct intelligence-gathering.
1.1.9. Con: Many of the harms of publishing hacked information are long-term and diffuse: such as the erosion of private dialogue, and the encouragement of hackers. This means individual journalists are badly placed to assess whether to publish any particular set of hacked data, as while the individual case might be in the public interest the far-reaching consequences may not be.
1.1.10. Con: Sources are often offered to non-professional media agencies, particularly if the mainstream media refuses to publish it. Eventually, a less scrupulous organisation or even the hacker themself is likely to publish that source; meaning that the discretion of journalists is ultimately ineffective as a control mechanism.
1.1.11. Pro: There is no incentive for journalists to publish false information, because it will undermine their own credibility.
1.1.11.1. Con: While this is theoretically true, journalists are very rarely neutral parties, attempting to find the 'absolute truth'; rather, they supply stories and information that feeds into their publishers' expectations. Hence [Fox News](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/tv/fox/) and other politically-orientated publications can publish whatever they fancy with minimal recourse to truth.
1.1.11.2. Con: Increasingly, journalists are under pressure to be the first to break a story. This means they are less likely to be vigilant in fact-checking their sources.
1.1.12. Pro: There is no principled distinction between publishing hacked data and information gained through other dubious journalistic means.
1.1.12.1. Con: The distinction is legality. Many elements of journalism are intrinsically dubious, but hacking is ultimately illegal, where deception is not.
1.1.12.2. Pro: Hacking is simply a new method of leaking information and should not be treated differently from other forms of leaks. If laws were broken in the hacking, those acts can be prosecuted regardless of the publication.
1.1.12.3. Pro: [Undercover investigative journalism](http://archives.cjr.org/campaign_desk/the_ethics_of_undercover_journalism.php) is inherently deceptive. It involves physically breaching boundaries to get information, where hacking virtually breaches boundaries.
1.1.12.4. Pro: Journalists regularly [solicit and manipulate sources](http://observer.com/2015/04/journalisms-sourcing-problem/) in a way which disregards traditional journalistic ethics.
1.2. Con: Existing 'whistleblower' laws and protections are not sufficient to serve the public interest. Sometimes breaking the law via hacking can be for the greater good.
1.2.1. Con: Mass hacks and data dumps are not whistleblowing. The Clinton email leak, for example - which [undoubtedly affected](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/wikileaks-hillary-clinton/) the election outcome - was a massive data dump with only small aspects that could be considered 'whistleblowing'; the rest was such minutiae as [how to cook the perfect risotto](https://www.thewrap.com/hillary-clinton-email-leaks-reveal-secret-perfect-risotto-john-podesta/). Vast invasions of privacy, which would have been conducted without prior knowledge of any misdeed, are not whistleblowing but amount to attempted smear campaigns.
1.2.2. Con: Hackers are poor arbiters of whether or not a law is fair, or whether it is worth breaking it in any circumstance, as opposed to publicly-accountable watchdogs.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Plenty of hackers are motivated by political opinions, thus while the information may be important to them it is not necessarily in the public interest.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Hackers are predominantly young men, who often have disproportionately [anarchist beliefs](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/04/forget-far-right-populism-crypto-anarchists-are-the-new-masters-internet-politics). Their interests are therefore different from the median member of the public.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: It is [highly likely](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/26/us/2016-presidential-campaign-hacking-fast-facts/index.html) that a series of Democratic Party \(US\) hacks were underwritten by the Russian Government for direct political gain.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Julian Assange, from Wikileaks, in [all likelihood](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/wikileaks-motivations_us_57a2575ee4b04414d1f365b1) has an anti-US and perhaps specifically anti-Hillary Clinton bias.
1.2.2.1.4. Con: It is impossible to define what is in the 'public interest' or not. Indeed, it is arguable that all information — positive or negative — is ultimately in the public interest, as individuals have a right to pertinent information on items of importance.
1.2.2.2. Con: There is no reason to assume all hackers are poor arbiters of legal fairness, nor reasons to break laws.
1.2.3. Pro: Publishing hacked data is useful to prove the hack itself. This is important when the objective is to warn people of a insecure system they may be relying on.
1.2.4. Con: This could cause retaliation by the entities being hacked. It could include laws and security barriers that could possibly restrict freedoms of non-involved people \(like regular citizens\).
1.2.5. Pro: Far from being protected whistleblowers are often actively punished by governments.
1.2.5.1. Pro: The UK is [currently looking](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/12/uk-government-accused-full-frontal-attack-prison-whistleblowers-media-journalists) to increase the jail sentences for individuals who reveal state secrets.
1.2.5.2. Pro: [Thomas Drake](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/22/how-pentagon-punished-nsa-whistleblowers), a man who used official whistleblowing channels to report similar concerns to those raised by Edward Snowden, had his career destroyed by the Defence Department.
1.2.6. Pro: Protections for whistleblowers are very vulnerable to erosion, as it is often directly contrary to the interests of those tasked with facilitating the pathway to do so.
1.2.6.1. Con: There are [effective ways](https://www.nao.org.uk/naoblog/whistleblowing-good-practice/) of running whistleblowing programmes. Efforts should be focussed on improving these rather than using the imperfect alternative of hacking.
1.2.6.2. Pro: John Crane, formerly a high ranking employee of the NSA recalls [systemic corruption](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/22/how-pentagon-punished-nsa-whistleblowers) which both prevented whistleblowers from achieving change, and facilitated their persecution.
1.3. Con: The absolute transparency of published hacks is important in principle because it is crucial that journalists occasionally exercise their right to free speech in controversial ways. Without such tests we cannot ensure that free speech will continue to be a well-defended norm for all in society.
1.3.1. Pro: A free and candid press is required to keep the public up to date so that they can make informed decisions.
1.3.1.1. Con: Only information that is in the public interest is required to make informed decisions; absolute transparency is not.
1.3.2. Con: Free speech has to be balanced against privacy rights, which have been breached when information is hacked.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Privacy rights allow individuals to feel secure, which is foundational for human happiness.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Privacy allows people to maintain different public and personal identities, which is required for people to live fulfilling lives.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The ability to communicate privately to particular individuals is essential in maintaining specific relationships.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: The biggest hack of this nature is the [2014 iCloud leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud_leaks_of_celebrity_photos), which released 500+ personal pictures of celebrities, including nude photographs. Not a single item of 'public interest' was released.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: People's personal actions can, if publicly released, influence their employment.
1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Brendan Eich, previous CEO of Mozilla Firefox, had to step down when it was [revealed](https://www.rt.com/business/mozilla-gay-marriage-scandal-449/) that he had privately donated to a campaign against marriage reform.
1.3.2.2.3. Con: The private actions of prominent people should sometimes be revealed as they can be relevant to their public life.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: A number of prominent politicians, who have campaigned on conservative values, have been involved in [sex scandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_sex_scandals_in_the_United_States#2010%E2%80%932018). This raises questions of hypocrisy.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Con: It is unreasonable to hold all individuals to account with every element of their lives, including their private and personal lives. Regardless of prominence, individuals have an inalienable right to a degree of privacy.
1.3.2.3. Con: The importance of privacy is constructed: if society was more open, and people more used to sharing information, then it would seem far less threatening for details to be made public.
1.3.3. Con: The ability to have political and industrial conversations privately enables free and frank discourse, which in turn facilitates better outcomes.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Confidentiality is key in [building trust](http://www.littlethingsmatter.com/blog/2010/08/24/building-trust-through-confidentiality/); without trust, relationships \(professional and personal\) collapse.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Corporate information is often market-sensitive. If it is released, it can cause panic before a company has had a chance to fix a problem, destabilising crucial markets.
1.3.3.3. Con: Conversations behind closed doors often result in decisions that are not in the public interest. Political parties and corporations are fundamentally self-interested and only the knowledge that the public may learn of their motivations can temper this.
1.3.3.4. Pro: Diplomats will often communicate with their government of origin using less than diplomatic language. This is important as a real, un-sanitised awareness of the situation in other countries is valuable.
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: Wikileaks revealed diplomatic communications that alleged that Russia had become a "[mafia state](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/us-embassy-cable-leak-diplomacy-crisis)" due to the close relationship between organised criminals and the intelligence agencies. This useful diplomatic discussion might not have occurred in a world where hacks are expected to disrupt secret conversations.
1.3.4. Pro: Secrecy is used by the powerful to maintain a status quo that benefits them. The threat of absolute transparency only undermines this if journalists are not punished for revealing information.
1.3.4.1. Con: Conversely, as hacking often requires considerable resources and is anonymous, it can be used by powerful forces to benefit their interests.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: The leak of DNC emails by Wikileaks, later discovered to have been [orchestrated by the Russian government](http://time.com/4625301/cia-russia-wikileaks-dnc-hacking/), damaged the 2016 Clinton presidential campaign.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Assuming the DNC data was accurate, it was relevant to voters. It would have been a disservice to suppress the data, irrespective of its origin or its potential to sway voters
1.3.4.2. Con: People who have less power in society often value privacy extremely highly, because anonymity allows them a greater degree of freedom.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Political dissidents value online anonymity highly. For example, during the Arab Spring, the ability to hide one's identity online was [crucial](http://www.monitor.upeace.org/innerpg.cfm?id_article=816) to the spread of protests.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Many LGBT people, particularly teenagers, value their [online privacy](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/digital-freedom-lgbt-issue) because it allows them to express their identity in a safe space.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Governments write the rules and regulations which keeps information private. The incentive of political parties is to keep damaging information secret when they are in power, this distorts the democratic process.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: The UK government [hid behind the confidential intelligence](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/9937516/Iraq-war-the-greatest-intelligence-failure-in-living-memory.html) they claimed they could not reveal to justify entry into the Iraq War. It was impossible for voters to assess the strength of the case for war without access to the '[dodgy dossier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Dossier)'.
1.3.4.4. Pro: Corporations manipulate the markets by creating information asymmetries that benefit their own economic interests.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: Goldman Sachs [shorted](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) the mortgage securities market before the 2008 financial crisis, whilst advising investors to put money in their own [mortgage-backed securities](https://www.ft.com/content/5defa420-4fa9-11df-a1ab-00144feab49a).
1.3.4.5. Pro: Precisely because the parties are so powerful and can afford the highest levels of protection, hacking is the only method to uncover to what end they use this power.
1.4. Pro: Hacked information is often not obtained or released by neutral or objective sources, but is often tactically released to journalists in order to mislead or manipulate the public.
1.4.1. Con: The information from a hack is often factual material, not editorialised. As such the motives of a particular hacker are not relevant when it comes to determining the importance or meaning of a hack.
1.4.1.1. Con: Factual material can easily be manipulated and, inevitably, editorialised; hackers can choose what information they claim to have uncovered, and ignore other potentially important information if it does not conform to their biases. Hackers are in the unique position of having ultimate control of released data, and nobody can know what hackers do not wish us to know.
1.4.1.2. Pro: It is now common practice to reveal the full leak online for inspection. For example, Glenn Greenwald \(the main journalise in the Snowden case\) released the full files [on his website](http://glenngreenwald.net/#BookDocuments).
1.4.1.3. Pro: This makes the role of the journalist as a professional, ethical navigator of the information all the more important. They can also act as a professional critic by analysing the judgements applied to the data, and the potential impact of it.
1.4.2. Pro: Illegally-obtained information is difficult to verify and corroborate, meaning it is often published without rigorous fact checking.
1.4.2.1. Con: There are a variety of ways to verify and corroborate information; as data hacks grow ever more common, the internet community is [finding and promoting](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/78k8e9/hacking-reporting-verification-data-breaches-how-to) ways to ensure authenticity.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Sources who get their information from hacks have a natural fear of prosecution and so typically remain anonymous. This limits their reliability as they can't back up their information with personal verifications or corroborations.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Sources who get their information from hacks have a natural fear of prosecution and so typically remain anonymous. This makes it harder to understand their motives.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.2.3.2. Con: There may be very little motive to find; in the case of a [NASA hack](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gv5g77/the-nasa-hack-is-probably-the-most-mundane-hack-ever), it seems to have been conducted simply because the hackers could, rather than for any ulterior purpose. Anonymous or not, the hackers' motives are irrelevant in determining what to do with hacked information.
1.4.2.3.3. Pro: The motives may equally be based on an individual's moral compass; for example, the [Ashley Madison hack](http://fortune.com/2015/08/19/ashley-madison-media/) was apparently for 'moral/ethical reasons'. The logic appears to be that users 'deserve' to be hacked because they have committed adultery, an opinion that may not be shared.
1.4.2.4. Pro: If the data is hacked how do you verify the accuracy of this data? Data can be and is frequently manipulated and if the person has a grudge they can and probably will edit the information to cause greatest harm. And publishing such as fact can cause loss of reputation to the  publisher \(Dan Rathers as an example\).
1.4.2.5. Con: This is symptomatic of hidden or difficult to obtain data, illegally obtained or not; not all journalism can adhere to the highest possible standards of fact-checking. Whether or not they should is a separate matter.
1.4.3. Pro: Illegally-obtained political information is often incredibly corrupting of the political process, as it can be disclosed tactically to damage political parties or politicians.
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.
1.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.4.3.3. Con: Politics is hardly a noble pursuit; a degree of tactical damage and propaganda is expected. Hacked information is merely one aspect of a long list of potential political sabotages.
1.4.4. Pro: Given this information often comes out anyway \(e.g. via whistleblowers or investigation\), it is preferable to delay publishing until it comes from a more credible source.
1.4.4.1. Con: For time-sensitive matters, like elections or referenda, there may not be time to wait.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: The publication of hacked data derails discourse around important issues.
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Hacking can start discourse around topics that were previously undisclosed, or focus attention on neglected areas.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.3.1.
1.4.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: The [Panama Papers](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers) started a conversation about off-shore tax havens.
1.4.4.1.1.1.3. Con: Leaking hacked information can definitely start a positive discourse. However, for everyone's sake, including the leaker, discretion should be used about what to leak. Documents shouldn't be leaked just because they were hacked.
1.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: Trying to ascribe blame also diverts attention from the issues at hand. The [Clinton emails](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/wikileaks-hillary-clinton/) being attributed to Russia, and [Sony to North Korea](http://uk.businessinsider.com/north-korea-sony-hack-2016-6?r=US&IR=T), was politically divisive and drew a huge amount of attention.
1.4.4.1.1.3. Con: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. Some hacked data is very important, and a lot of unimportant news makes it to news outlets. All news, hacked or otherwise, must be evaluated on its own merit.
1.4.4.1.1.4. Pro: By publishing hacked information, journalists can make unethical actors look sympathetic or like victims.
1.4.4.1.1.5. Pro: Often, public discussion revolves around the moral question of the hacking, rather than the information it exposes.
1.4.4.1.1.5.1. Con: Even derailed public discussion of issues affecting public interest is better than that information never coming to light to be discussed in the first place.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.
1.4.5. Con: There is no reason to suppose this is true more of hacked sources than other forms of leaked sources. Journalists are well-equipped to provide caution and balance in their reportage.
1.4.5.1. Con: Other formed of leaked sources typically require inside access making their motives easier to ascertain — such as a political staffer leaking against their boss or party. However, the wide-ranging nature of hacking means that sources could have little to no ties to the information they offer; making normal approaches to caution and balance difficult.
1.4.6. Con: That information will be published anyway, so it is important that journalists give it context and explain it to the general public.
1.4.6.1. Con: If we treat hackers as criminals - which would not be unreasonable - then there is no reason to assume that information would inevitably be published. Without the implicit support of journalists who report on and spread their information, hacking would remain unacceptable and data would remain protected.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: The internet enables individuals to publish information, regardless of whether it was obtained illegally.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Pro: The perpetrator of a hack that grossly breached the privacy of a number of female celebrities, by circulating their personal files, was [arrested](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/03/jennifer-lawrence-nude-photo-hack-pleads-guilty) by the FBI. These personal files still made it onto the internet.
1.4.6.1.1.2. Pro: There have been [numerous examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing#Notable_examples) where people attempted to silence or attack other individuals by releasing their personal data on the internet.
1.4.6.2. Con: Hackers can leverage journalistic cover to gain influence. Having attained this level of fame they can then release information directly themselves.
1.4.6.2.1. Pro: The work of the Guardian, New York Times, Der Speigel, Le Monde, and El País in [all likelihood](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/28/wikileaks-julian-assange-alan-rusbridger) elevated the profile of Wikileaks, and thus the impact of their future leaks.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Many of the organisations that obtain this information are less scrupulous than journalists and don't edit it to protect people's safety \(as was the case for [Wikileaks](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/01/wikileaks-make-public-all-state-cables)\). If journalists don't release, and vet, this information then it will be released in its more dangerous raw form.
1.5. Pro: 'Data dumps' often contain overwhelming amounts of information that make publishing them incredibly risky.
1.5.1. Pro: Even if some information is of intense public interest, the entire data set often contains highly personal information that is embarrassing or privacy-breaching for innocent bystanders.
1.5.1.1. Pro: The Sony hack also publicised [private conversations](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_big_idea/2014/12/sony_email_hack_journalists_shouldn_t_publish_the_leaked_emails.html), including those where individuals were criticised or mocked, or where racist or prejudicial jokes were used. Given that no part of the hack had any real public interest beyond gossip and speculation, it is unacceptable that such data was broadly spread.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Or even dangerous; Wikileaks published information with personal, identifiable data on millions of [women in Turkey](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/zeynep-tufekci/wikileaks-erdogan-emails_b_11158792.html). This included home addresses, mobile numbers and other personal information which put a huge number of women in immediate danger.
1.5.1.3. Pro: The Sony hack [leaked 47,000 Social Security Numbers](https://www.cnet.com/news/sony-hack-said-to-leak-47000-social-security-numbers-celebrity-data/).
1.5.1.4. Pro: For example, the publication of hacked data from [Ashley Madison](https://nypost.com/2016/09/01/the-ashley-madison-hacks-deadly-aftermath/) \(a site which facilitates infidelity\) is believed to have led to multiple suicides.
1.5.1.4.1. Con: A site that facilitates behaviors that run counter to community or cultural standards is storing data that those who participate must know is of interest to those opposing that behavior and ergo at risk of exposure.
1.5.2. Pro: Responsible journalism requires redacting tertiary information and details from reports that does not serve the public interest. With so much data it is difficult to do so in a comprehensive manner.
1.5.3. Pro: With so much data it is easy to sneak in fake information amongst the real and harder to tell what information may have been deliberately omitted.
1.5.3.1. Pro: It is [immensely time-consuming](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9a3y4e/hacker-plans-to-dump-alleged-details-of-20000-fbi-9000-dhs-employees) to establish whether the majority of a data dump is even partly accurate. The finer details are even harder to confirm. As such, it is extremely unlikely that all information in such a dump will ever be thoroughly checked.
1.5.4. Con: Selectively publishing leaked sources leaves the journalist open to charges of 'cherry-picking' evidence.
1.5.5. Con: Although initially overwhelming, it is better to allow multiple media agencies the chance to examine the leak in case the original journalist overlooked or deliberately ignored something.
1.5.6. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.
1.5.7. Con: -> See 1.4.6.
1.6. Pro: To employ information obtained via hacking is to condone and even encourage an illegal and generally harmful action.
1.6.1. Con: Journalists can discourage hacks by avoiding naming the hackers while still using the information provided.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.1.
1.6.3. Pro: A culture of permissiveness for hacking can even encourage journalists to engage in the illegal activity themselves.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Journalists for [News of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal) notoriously engaged in phone hacking.
1.6.3.2. Con: In a scenario where journalists resort to illegal activities for the collection of information, they can be held accountable.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: There is a distinction between stating that a certain type of information was illegally obtained, and actually disseminating the information. So yes, knowingly passing on the illegally obtained information is technically a crime.
1.6.3.2.1.1. Con: Whether a journalist passes along illegal information or not is purely up to the journalist. They "should" do whatever their conscience tells them. Should the illegal information be shared with the public for their own good? Is the "illegal" information hiding something shady, illegal, or immoral? But the journalist should not do it just for personal fame.
1.6.4. Pro: We would not permit or encourage people to break into people's houses or offices to steal information; we shouldn't do so for hackers either.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Publishing  hacked material is to encourage illegal activity, and illegal activity leads to chaos, and a breakdown of society.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Journalists should not publish any sensitive information that breaks laws \(which are in place to protect the common good\).
1.6.5. Pro: Hackers often have ulterior motives and rarely only perform hacks that serve the public interest. By publicising hacking in general it softens the image of hacking to the general public.
1.6.5.1. Con: Some hackers, such as whistleblowers, do not have such incentives and arguably deserve to be appreciated for their efforts.
1.6.6. Pro: It’s illegally obtained. Consent of the parties involved is a necessity. If it becomes commonplace to broadcast hacked information, no person is safe from their personal lives, writings, thoughts, etc being broadcast without their consent. Anyone can claim to be a journalist to get away with What should be seen as a crime. Being a journalist doesn’t afford a person different laws or rules.
1.6.7. Con: Many tactics used by investigative journalism, for example using a false identity, are only ethical in certain circumstances. Using some information procured through hacking does not legitimise all instances.
1.7. Con: Hacking levels the playing field between individuals and powerful government or corporate entities. It is thus necessary to combat and expose their wrong doing.
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.7.2. Con: Hacking a private company in the optimistic hope of finding evidence of wrongdoing is still wrong; it turns journalism into a fishing exercise, supporting and profiting from the whims of different hackers.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Any individual or company will doubtless have data that could be incriminating, if one is inclined to try, but this cannot be used to justify invasion of privacy and theft of personal information.
1.7.3. Con: It is not desirable for governments to have equal power to other institutions. For example, intelligence-gathering requires secrecy that by necessity should not have transparent oversight.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Internal checks and balances, such as private sessions of elected bodies or closed court hearings, are sufficient to ensure power is not abused.
1.7.4. Pro: The asymmetrical nature of hacking means that individuals or small groups can often inflict serious harm on large institutions.
1.7.4.1. Pro: In hacking offence is much easier than defence: a system only need to have one identifiable flaw in order to potentially be exploited in total.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Large institutions like corporations or governments have a large 'attack surface' because of the complex and sprawling nature of their digital systems.
1.7.4.3. Pro: Important information does not become less important just because the people possessing it do not want it shared. More often the opposite is true.
1.7.5. Pro: Information that can be obtained by hacking has probably, or will probably, be obtained by foreign actors anyway.
1.7.6. Pro: Often, these powerful actors actively find loopholes in or circumvent Freedom of Information laws and other policies designed to protect the public interest. Hacking is therefore a legitimate tool in delivering the public important information which they are entitled to.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Controversial Freedom of Information requests are often [routinely stalled or obstructed](http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/audioFiles/Palmer%20Speech%20on%20Official%20Information%20Act.pdf) leading to "frustrating delays, particularly with regards to more controversial or sensitive material".
1.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.5.
1.8. Con: If the source was willing to break the law to publicise this information it is more likely to be important information and serve the public interest.
1.8.1. Con: The information may also be gleaned to titillate rather than for serious journalism. Incidents like the [Ashley Madison hack](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34041039) and the [Sony hack](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/opinion/aaron-sorkin-journalists-shouldnt-help-the-sony-hackers.html?_r=0) illustrate this: no information was 'important' and certainly did not serve any type of public interest.
1.8.2. Con: The motive may equally be monetary. The [Sony hack](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/opinion/aaron-sorkin-journalists-shouldnt-help-the-sony-hackers.html?_r=0) was described by FBI as 'being backed by a lot of money', and the journalists who then circulated the information certainly profited. The information gleaned served absolutely no purpose beyond monetary gain and titillation for readers.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Since the reporter receives payment for the story, using illegally obtained information is profit from ill gotten fruits. They have no right to use the information and should be indicted if the information was obtained through a crime \(i.e. hacking\).
1.8.3. Pro: Studying whistleblowers [has revealed](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/psychology-whistleblower_n_5889630) that it is generally the severity of the situation that determines if someone will whistleblow. It seems likely that this will hold true for other sources, such as hackers, who endanger themselves to reveal information.
1.8.4. Pro: Journalists should leverage the power of data in every form. If hacked data can help to unravel further vital information it should be used.
1.8.4.1. Pro: If the data is relevant to public health, safety, and freedom then it is vital for it be be public. People have a right to know what is going on, that which their taxes pay for, or how elected officials are acting.
1.8.5. Pro: Although release of hacked information may be damaging to the subject, the objective of informing the public, especially the voting public, should be preserved with much higher protections and regard than the subject’s contrived legal protections that enable them to lie and conceal damaging truths.
1.8.6. Pro: The high-profile prosecution of several hackers means the risk of imprisonment is obvious to those who are considering illegally obtaining classified information.
1.8.6.1. Pro: Aaron Schwartz faced [7 years in prison](https://www.cnet.com/news/from-wargames-to-aaron-swartz-how-u-s-anti-hacking-law-went-astray/) for hacking academic papers, before taking his life as a result of the charges.
1.8.7. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.9. Pro: Hacking is often used to obtain highly-protected and highly-confidential information. This information is often hugely damaging when made fully public in a way that does not serve the public interest.
1.9.1. Pro: Hacks can expose the confidential information of corporations such as unreleased earnings, trade secrets, or internal processes. Such information is sensitive but not necessary to highlight any wrong doing.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Leaks of [Apple's iPhone designs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2017/08/30/apple-iphone-8-release-date-price-design-specs-ios-11/#6d12e7a57fea) revealed information about the iPhone 8 and iPhone X that reduced their market impact when officially unveiled.
1.9.2. Con: The damage to the group that hid the information is often justly deserved.
1.9.2.1. Pro: The loss of stock market value from implication in the [Panama Papers Leak](https://panamapapers.icij.org/20161201-global-impact.html) represented a justified public reaction given the companies unethical tax practices.
1.9.3. Pro: Releasing sensitive, secret, and illegally obtained hacked information is not reliable and is not free speech. It is, in its essence of having been obtained under illegal terms, a criminal act and therefore, criminal information. There are some strategies every government should not release to the public since most people would misunderstand and panic.
1.9.4. Con: Value is a subjective concept. What one values to protect from scrutiny can be truth about activity or products actually detrimental to public or other persons good. For centuries strongmen and governments have hid their doings to avoid coming under criticism or legal action.
1.9.5. Pro: Celebrity hacks unduly expose personal information and violate privacy without serving the public interest.
1.9.5.1. Pro: Unfinished songs from Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake, Kelly Clarkson and Kesha were [hacked and sold online](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/03/hackers-steal-musicians-music) for over 10000 euros.
1.9.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.1.
1.9.6. Pro: Publishing hacked personal data can have unintended consequences, often for innocent third parties.
1.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.9.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.4.
1.9.6.3. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.
1.9.7. Pro: Much of the confidential information held by the government has the potential to threaten national security and national interests if revealed.
1.9.7.1. Con: Threatening national security was used as an emotive reason to condemn Chelsea Manning, but it became clear that she had [not in fact done so](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/chelsea-manning-leaks-national-security-us-no-damage-report-us-a7801101.html). It is often used to whip up moral panic far beyond the actual consequences of the leaks.
1.9.7.2. Pro: Most of the Snowden leaks concerned military, defence, and intelligence [programmes](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/house-committee-blasts-edward-snowden-n649146) used to gather intelligence on the USA's adversaries.
1.9.7.3. Pro: Wikileaks no longer even [attempt to edit leaks](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37165230) to protect people named in them.
1.9.7.4. Con: Leaked TSA documents helped expose past [security failings](http://www.zdnet.com/article/leaked-files-reveal-catalog-of-airport-security-lapses/) of an airport in New York and led to improved security standards.
1.9.8. Con: -> See 1.3.4.5.
