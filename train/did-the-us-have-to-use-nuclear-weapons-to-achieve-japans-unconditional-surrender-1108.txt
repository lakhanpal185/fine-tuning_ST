Discussion Title: Did the US have to use nuclear weapons to achieve Japan's unconditional surrender?

1. The U.S. had to use nuclear weapons to achieve its goal of Japan unconditionally surrendering.
1.1. Pro: Perceptions of the times were that it was necessary.
1.1.1. Pro: While this is an anecdotal observation it demonstrates the perception of the times, the views of people closest to the issue, and the views of the people who would be most affected if a different solution \(esp. invasion\) was used. This viewpoint, and others like it, provides context to the discussion.
1.1.2. Con: Too often emotional reactions to events or actions can cause extreme view changes. That doesn't mean they are the right ones.
1.1.3. Pro: Military staff was outspoken that they didn't consider any other  role for the Japanese people than annihilation.
1.1.3.1. Pro: One out of four US combatants stated that their primary goal was to kill Japanese rather than to win the war \([Dower, p.53](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\)
1.1.3.2. Pro: Half of all GIs believed that it would be necessary to kill ALL Japanese before peace can be realized \([Dower, p. 53](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.1.4. Con: It is only normal that soldiers are obsessed with annihilating an enemy. This doesn't say much about the feelings of society.
1.1.4.1. Con: About 10-13% of Americans supported the "extermination" of the Japanese people \([Dower, p. 53](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.1.4.2. Con: 22.7% of Americans regretted in December 1945 that the war ended too soon before they had the chance to drop "many more" nuclear weapons on Japan \([Dower, p. 54](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.1.4.3. Con: The British ambassador reported to London that US public opinion is "exterminationist" against Japan in 1944 \([Dower, p. 53](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.1.5. Pro: The US had to use nuclear weapons as it drew the lesson from defeating Germany in WWI that an incomplete victory would result in another war.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Admiral Halsey spoke of Japan's "100-Year-War Plans" and how everything short of destruction would leave opportunity to regain strength \([Dower, p. 56](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.1.5.2. Con: There were many better options possible to prevent repeat wars.
The UK and France especially [had many opportunities to prevent German re-expansion](https://www.historyonthenet.com/world-war-two-causes/), but politically chose not to stop him - this should be the mistake not made twice, rather than not using further force when finishing off an enemy.
1.1.5.3. Con: The [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles) was a complete victory, as would have been Japanese surrender, demilitarization, and compensation.  Extra force targeted against civilians \(or even further, completely wiping out the losing state\) is not needed to achieve a "complete victory".
1.1.6. Con: This bypasses the original question. If the US sincerely thought it had to use nuclear weapons, but was wrong in that assessment, then it did not "...have to use nuclear weapons to achieve Japan's unconditional surrender."
1.2. Con: Japan would have surrendered, [irrespective](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/08/14/historians-soviet-offensive-key-japans-wwii-surrender-eclipsed-bombs.html) of the use of nuclear weapons, because the Soviet Union joined the war.
1.2.1. Con: The Russian declaration of war was not, by itself, sufficient to force the Japanese to sue for peace.  Russia could attack Japanese forces in Manchuria and elsewhere in Asia.  However, Russia had no realistic capability to invade the Japanese mainland in sufficient strength.  The Normandy invasion \(presumably similar in size\) used 7000 ships, including 4000 transports and landing craft.  In 1945 the Russian Pacific Fleet had less than 400 ships and very few landing craft.
1.2.2. Pro: Japan had prepared for Operation Downfall by [bolstering defense in places like Iwo Jima, Formosa, and Okinawa.](https://history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1/ch13.htm)This would have drawn forces away from the north, leading to an unprepared military in the face of Soviet forces, leading to a likely surrender.
1.2.3. Pro: Japan's Supreme Council treated the bombing of Hiroshima with so [little](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/) regard that they did not even hold a special council or mention it at their next meeting amidst the bombing of many other Japanese Cities.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Japanese general and war minister [Korechika Anami](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/) commented on August 13th, that the atomic bombings were not a greater threat than the fire-bombings.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: On August 7th [Korechika Anami](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/55a.pdf) admitted in secret discussions with the military leadership that situation changed because of the Hiroshima bombing.
1.2.3.2. Con: In the evening of August 7th, Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo and Army Minister Anami [met](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/55a.pdf) secretly and agreed that defeat is imminent because of the nuclear weapon.
1.2.3.3. Con: Naval Minister [Mitsumasa Yonai](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/55b.pdf) noted that the situation is getting steadily worse, "especially after Hiroshima".
1.2.3.4. Con: They could not hold a meeting because their [time](http://www.mconway.net/page1/page15/files/Shock%20of%20Atomic%20Bomb.pdf) did not allow for an extra meeting.
1.2.4. Pro: The Soviet Union advanced quickly across Manchuria, Korea and the Kuril Islands, making an immediate invasion of Hokkaido likely.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Japanese defense efforts were directed towards Honshu leaving [Hokkaido's 5th Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Fifth_Area_Army) relatively under-equipped.
1.2.4.2. Con: It was not before Japan's surrender that the successful resistance to Soviet attacks on [South Sakhalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_South_Sakhalin#Karafuto_Line) was dropped.
1.2.4.3. Con: The Japanese resistance in Manchuria was very strong, causing considerable problems to Soviet advances.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: In the heavily wooded mountains and swampy lowlands of Manchuria, Japanese resistance was [slight](http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/LP8_AugustStormSovietTacticalAndOperationalCombatInManchuria_1945.pdf).
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: At the [Battle of Mutanchiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mutanchiang) the Japanese resisted strongly and were able to inflict severe [damage](http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/LP8_AugustStormSovietTacticalAndOperationalCombatInManchuria_1945.pdf) on Soviet forces.
1.2.4.3.3. Pro: Initial attacks on August 9th had been [repelled](http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/LP8_AugustStormSovietTacticalAndOperationalCombatInManchuria_1945.pdf) by the Japanese.
1.2.4.3.4. Pro: The Japanese fought strongly in the defense of a garrison at [Hutou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jixi#Hutou_Fortress).
1.2.4.3.5. Con: The Japanese army was completely taken by [surprise](http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/LP8_AugustStormSovietTacticalAndOperationalCombatInManchuria_1945.pdf) of the Soviet Invasion.
1.2.4.4. Pro: [Stalin](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/05/stalin_japan_hiroshima_occupation_hokkaido/) had plans to invade [Hokkaido](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=-9EBuQK-NRQC&pg=PA265&lpg=PA265&dq=stalin+hokkaido+invasion&source=bl&ots=GH1OB-upBo&sig=Rad8DYlAVa63S1FoXKfph3-NBrM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje09GtuKPKAhWIi5QKHcquAdsQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&q&f=false) and amassed [troops](http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/122335) and amphibious material to execute the plan.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Stalin's rough battle plan suggested to invade Hokkaido on [August 24th](http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/122335).
1.2.5. Pro: The Japanese ordered [martial law](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=70ZRhKAHM4oC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=%22the+people+would+gradually+get+used+to+being+bombed+daily.+In+time+their+unity+and+resolve+would+grow+stronger%22&source=bl&ots=kZYAbIjUwG&sig=aBYY0b3e7x7DzVCNr4CSt9pONGs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5-f6IkJfKAhVJFpQKHbLnALQQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=%22the%20people%20would%20gradually%20get%20used%20to%20being%20bombed%20daily.%20In%20time%20their%20unity%20and%20resolve%20would%20grow%20stronger%22&f=false) after the Soviet invasion began but remained calm after the nuclear attacks.
1.2.6. Con: The Japanese were willing to defend their home islands against an attacking Soviet Union.
1.2.6.1. Pro: [Operation Ketsu-go](http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/macarthur%20reports/macarthur%20v1/ch13.htm) provided for a planned and strategic defense of Honshu, indicating that Japan was willing and, to a certain extent, capable to counter a potential US invasion.
1.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.
1.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.
1.2.7. Con: Japanese Prime Minister Suzuki was [willing](http://www.mconway.net/page1/page15/files/Shock%20of%20Atomic%20Bomb.pdf) to surrender after Hiroshima but before the Soviet entry.
1.2.8. Pro: The Japanese hoped for [peace](http://www.indiana.edu/~psource/PDF/Current%20Articles/Fall2014/5%20Dennis%20Fall%2014.pdf) brokered by the Soviets. Once this opportunity vanished, they surrendered.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Even after [Hiroshima](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=XjW49VTRhxQC&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=the+end+of+the+pacific+war+tsuyoshi+hasegawa&source=bl&ots=JoShhJYDVW&sig=PImhjPSdxlo6tnsVzxUSvflO2bk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibpN-g0JnKAhWl6aYKHSipAskQ6AEIMjAF#v=onepage&q&f=false) was bombed, Japan inquired about Russia as a broker, indicating that the bombs had not made a difference.
1.2.9. Pro: The US was aware of the Japanese intention to - nearly unconditional - surrender since they decoded a communication on a mediating request by Japan to Moscow on [July 11](https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/2003-817-10-Hasegawa.pdf).
1.2.9.1. Pro: The eventual accepted agreement between the US offered after dropping the bombs was [identical](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_weber.html) to one offered by Japan to the US before the bombs were dropped.
1.2.9.2. Pro: The Japanese surrendered [on the same terms after the A-bombings as they had insisted on before the bombings](https://mises.org/library/hiroshima-myth). The US knew Japan wanted to surrender & had approached Russians to act as an intermediary, their only condition to total surrender was to keep the Emperor.
1.2.9.3. Pro: The US throughout the war took actions as to not bind it's hands regarding the emperor question so that they could live with keeping him.
1.2.9.3.1. Pro: In 1942, the Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens who was part of the propaganda movies the US produced was suspended because he favored a narrative that blames the Emperor \([Dower, p. 19](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.2.9.4. Con: Decoded communication lacks official confirmation and thus makes it unreliable.
1.2.9.5. Con: Nearly unconditional surrender is just not unconditional surrender - the declared goal of the USA.
1.2.9.5.1. Con: The "nearly" is only referring to Japan wanting to retain the Emperor, something that the U.S. ended up tolerating anyway.
1.2.9.6. Con: Japan showed [every indication](https://books.google.de/books?id=rlBaxUX7QhYC&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=%22dower%22+%22war+without+mercy%22+%22bitter+end%22&source=bl&ots=_eOM8X0a6c&sig=FT12FQ7PAdUwgNxc7uUMlcsFU8s&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22dower%22%20%22war%20without%20mercy%22%20%22bitter%20end%22&f=false) it would fight to the last person.
1.2.9.6.1. Pro: Japan would not have surrendered as a matter of racial pride and sense of superiority, divine right and destiny to win.  They would have fought to the last breath if not for such a profoundly superior demonstration of military strength.
1.2.9.6.2. Pro: After the [Battle of the Philippine Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Philippine_Sea) in '44, Japan had a fighter strength of 2,200. Of those two thirds were reserved for training to defend the Home Islands \([Prados, p. 43](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317598/storm-over-leyte-by-john-prados/9780451473615/)\).
1.2.9.6.3. Con: Heroism alone only can take you that far. An army with no supplies and shuttered morale would disperse eventually. Japan, in 1945, had lost most of its territory gained in previous years so resources were scarce. The war industry could not produce what was lost and most people would have to defend Japan with primitive weapons. The blockade by the US was total and Manchuria would soon fall. Facing this, Japanise soldier would surrender no matter the belief.
1.2.9.6.3.1. Con: The Japanese military might have been crippled, but the Japanese military government had planned to arm civilians under Operation Ketsu-Gō, which envisioned “The Glorious Death of One Hundred Million” before Japan would surrender to the Allies. The ‘Volunteer Fighting Corps’- a new civilian unit of the IJA  made up of all “healthy men aged 15 to 60 and women 17 to 40 for a total of 28 million people”- was mobilized for the purpose of stalling the Allied victory and forcing a bloody armistice.
1.2.9.6.3.1.1. Pro: The Japanese army had directed its efforts towards defending Honshu in an attempt to withstand an invasion.
1.2.9.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: Recent research \(e.g. Miscamble, The Most Controversial Decision, 2011\) on Japanese plans/intel and US plans/intel for the US invasion shows Japanese knew our invasion spot\(s\), fortified and massively reinforced those areas.
1.2.9.6.3.1.1.2. Pro: In May 1945 [Kamikaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_the_United_States_during_World_War_II#Kamikaze) attacks were halted in order to save fuel and airplanes for the final battle over Japanese home islands.
1.2.9.6.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: The Japanese [estimated](http://www.upa.pdx.edu/IMS/currentprojects/TAHv3/Content/PDFs/Operation_Downfall.pdf) they would be able to sink around 400 US ships during an invasion through Kamikaze attacks.
1.2.9.6.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: The [order](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/51.pdf) given by the Japanese Supreme Naval Command on July 29 was to develop an air strategy "based on total suicide attacks" for the defense of Honshu.
1.2.9.6.3.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.2.9.6.3.1.1.4. Pro: Around 1 million soldiers were [relocated](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) from the Chinese mainland to the Japanese home islands to defend against a possible US invasion.
1.2.9.6.3.1.1.4.1. Con: This million strong army would need supplies and Japan is very resource-limited country. More army mean more supplies and Japan just didn't have the needed amount.
1.2.9.6.3.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The naval blockade against Japan is considered as the 'most [effective](https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=13706) naval blockade in history'.
1.2.9.6.3.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Following the destruction of the Japanese [merchant navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_submarines_in_the_Pacific_War), \(and their failure to replace their losses\), the American submarine fleet had so little to do that the submarines were tasked to [recover downed American pilots](https://www.archives.gov/files/publications/prologue/2014/fall/lifeguard.pdf).
1.2.9.6.3.1.1.5. Pro: There were 19 infantry divisions, 7 independent mixed brigades, 2 armored divisions, and 3 tank brigades to [defend](http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1/ch13_notes.htm#e61) Honshu against an invasion.
1.2.9.6.3.1.1.6. Con: Ground [defense plans](http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/macarthur%20reports/macarthur%20v1/ch13.htm) for Honshu were not created before January 1945. This made Japanese resistance sub-optimal.
1.2.9.6.3.2. Con: Individual Japanese soldiers fought for on for decades after surrender of the country without supplies or support. Several battles effectively were fought to the last man such as Iwo Jima where nearly 99% of the of the soldiers fought to the death without reasonable hope of supply or relief.
1.2.9.7. Con: The same communication noted that under the terms so far offered, Japan would have no choice but to "fight on with all its strength for the honour and existence of the Motherland". This weakened the extent to which the US could conclude with certainty that the Japanese would ultimately surrender, or do so with any speed.
1.2.9.8. Con: There is a reason that war requires very formal communication channels between adversaries. If the US had acted on this apparent signal of Japan's intent, the US risked being caught off-guard by a senior Japanese leader rejecting this idea.
1.2.10. Con: The Japanese surrender was substantially motivated by the Russian military advances but the Japanese surrendered to the US because the Japanese did not want to split Japan like Germany.
1.2.10.1. Pro: An occupation by the Soviet Union was perceived as a bigger threat than an occupation by the U.S.
1.2.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.2.10.1.2. Pro: The Soviet Union was known to Japan for acquiring territory, while the US could be expected to leave after a while.
1.2.10.1.2.1. Pro: The main reason for a stronger position in Manchuria was to create a [buffer zone](http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520219342) against the Soviet Union.
1.2.10.1.2.2. Pro: Russia had acquired territory in East Asia aggressively in the past and the Russo-Japanese war was fought over territory both countries sought.
1.2.10.1.3. Pro: Russian [atrocities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria#War_crimes) in Manchuria could be seen as what was to be expected.
1.2.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.1.
1.2.12. Con: Emperor Hirohito gave three reasons for Japan's surrender prior to the radio broadcast, these were–
1\) Tokyo's defenses would not be complete in time for the American invasion
2\) Ise Shrine \[one of Shinto's holiest and most important sites\] would be lost to the Americans
3\) Atomic weapons used by the Americans would decimate the Japanese population
\([worldcat.org](https://www.worldcat.org/title/american-shogun-general-macarthur-emperor-hirohito-and-the-drama-of-modern-japan/oclc/62134797)\)
1.3. Con: The bombs were partly dropped due to a translation error from a report on Prime minister Suzuki's stance in Japanese media. When asked his stance, he replied 'no comment' but the translation handed to the American's stated that he held their threat in [derisory contempt](https://www.pangeanic.com/knowledge_center/the-worst-translation-mistake-in-history/).
1.4. Pro: Only the use of nuclear bombs could convince Japan to surrender and thus was necessary.
1.4.1. Pro: Japan was unlikely to surrender otherwise given that it was a crime under the 1908 Army Criminal Code and social norms saw it as ["dishonor"](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=7WiPUjgq-ZAC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=1908+army+criminal+code&source=bl&ots=HJ6CxY7L7w&sig=VXMxOoOXIvDDF-nKATmqtEq7Reg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXk__UuqjKAhUDmpQKHfU1BDAQ6AEIPzAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.4.3. Pro: Japanese leaders hoped to reach a negotiated [agreement](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/Events/1945/surrender.htm) by inflicting heavy casualties during an invasion.
1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.4.5. Pro: The nuclear attacks gave a powerful [argument](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) to those within the Japanese Supreme Council who favored surrender.
1.4.5.1. Pro: [Togo](http://www.mconway.net/page1/page15/files/Shock%20of%20Atomic%20Bomb.pdf) invoked the new external threat to counter the army.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: This was in discussions following the Hiroshima bombing and did not lead to surrender.
1.4.5.2. Pro: The military was shaken in their belief that a negotiated agreement could be reached and reconsidered their opposition to surrender.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.4.5.2.3. Con: At the Supreme Council meeting on August 9th, Army Minister Anami, Chief of Army General Staff Umezu, and Chief of  Navy General Staff Toyoda disapproved of unconditional [surrender](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/62.pdf).
1.4.5.3. Pro: The Emperor became convinced of arguments forwarded by the surrender side.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: [Yokishuni Igarashi \(needs library access\)](http://www.worldcat.org/title/bomb-hirohito-and-history-the-foundational-narrative-of-united-states-japan-postwar-relations/oclc/695209798) has suggested that the bomb was necessary for the Emperor to intervene as a *symbolic* "hero of Japan," which gave him the legitimacy \(i.e. political capital\) to overrule the military government and bring a mostly-full surrender to the table. And, to be clear, the Emperor *did* retain his seat.
1.4.5.3.1.1. Con: The emperor was internally motivated to surrender.
1.4.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: ""In February 1945, Prince Fumimaro Konoe gave Emperor Hirohito a memorandum analyzing the situation, and told him that if the war continued, the imperial family might be in greater danger from an internal revolution than from defeat." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan#Divisions_within_the_Japanese_leadership)"
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: At the Supreme Council meeting on August 8th, Hirohito [favored](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/62.pdf) the surrender side with reference to the nations survival in light of new technology.
1.4.5.3.3. Pro: On August 14th, Hirohito [dismissed](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/74.pdf) calls by those who opposed unconditional surrender.
1.4.5.4. Pro: The threat of a single bomber making it through air defenses, dropping a single bomb and achieving what otherwise would have required hundreds of bomber sorties, is an improvement of a nation's military by several orders of magnitude. The showcase of the improved U.S. military capabilities did alter Japan's leadership's perception of the threat.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: Japanese perception of a threat was already very real, and the Japanese had already made overtures for surrender.
1.4.5.4.2. Pro: Air defense can never eliminate all bombers. A single bomber with the potential to do damage of hundreds of bombers makes air attacks much more threatening and renders air defense relatively useless.
1.4.5.4.3. Pro: A country that would face bombers equipped with nuclear weapons, would have to realize that if 50 bombers made it through, all its major cities and industrial complexes could be destroyed in one night.
1.4.5.4.4. Con: The threat of the nuclear bomb was never framed in the context of one single bomber versus a hundred others. The Japanese were just impressed by American military might.
1.4.5.5. Con: For the navy minister and the former prime minister it was not only the nuclear attacks, but rather the consideration of the atomic bombs in combination with [Russian entry](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) into war that became a convincing argument to surrender.
1.4.5.5.1. Pro: Russia played a [big role](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) in the unconditional surrender to the US. After Stalin proposed to the US a plan to divide Japan, the Japanese chose to surrender to the US to avoid being occupied by the Russians, who were not known to willingly return their conquests.
1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.4.
1.4.7. Pro: Nuclear weapons brought mass destruction easily, conveniently and instantly, which made them an ideal instrument to intimidate and terrorize the enemy in war efficiently, and to cause lots of damage and a high number of casualties in Japan.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Japan would not surrender unless mass casualties ensued. Japan's Kamikaze pilots inflicted mass casualties on themselves and the Americans, as over 1 million soldiers died at the hands of the Japanese. This needed to end as Japan would continue fighting until the bitter end if they realistically could. The nuclear weapon usage prohibited the Japanese from being able to counter.
1.4.7.2. Con: As the 'kill per dollar' ratio was very low the use of nuclear weapons was not a cost-efficient way to bomb Japan.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: But it was very effective in threatening the Japanese so much that they decided to end the war, which saved a lot of money.
1.4.7.2.1.1. Pro: Fighting the Japanese several more months would have been expensive, too.
1.4.7.2.2. Pro: With $2.4 billion the production of around 4,000 [B-29 bombers](http://www.wwiifoundation.org/students/wwii-aircraft-facts/) was more destructive than the $2 billion atomic bombs.
1.4.7.2.2.1. Con: 4000 B-29 bombers need pilots and crews to fly and operate them. Furthermore a ground crew is needed to check and repair them. Then airports are needed. Finally conventional bombs are also causing costs. All this points together make the fleet of 4000 bombers more expensive than on the first regard.
1.4.7.3. Con: The total damage inflicted by conventional weapons in 1944 and 1945 was more devastating than the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nuclear weapons, therefore, did not stand out in terms of threat.
1.4.7.3.1. Con: Conventional weapons do not have the same [devastating effect](https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/2013/4132-1-nuclear-weapons-human-health-2013.pdf) like nuclear weapons do.
1.4.7.3.1.1. Con: The firebombing of Tokyo was more deadly than the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima.
1.4.7.3.1.1.1. Pro: The firebombing of Tokyo was the third largest urban conflagration in recorded history only relegated by the fires of the Kanto earthquake in Tokyo and Yokohama 1923 \([Dower, p.41](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\)
1.4.7.3.1.1.2. Con: One plane was required to drop one nuclear bomb, while hundreds of sorties, each dropping multiple bombs, were required to achieve the same effect using conventional ordnance.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3. Con: The number of casualties in Hiroshima [doubled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki) already after a short while.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: Frequent estimates are that [140,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Post-attack_casualties) people died in Hiroshima in 1945 \(38.9% of the population\).
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: This casualty figure does not take into account the number of long-term casualties caused by the bombing of Hiroshima.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Taking into consideration all causes of death, the radiation reduced average lifespan by approximately 1.3 years - [GENETICS journal \(2016\)](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-08/gsoa-lhe080416.php).
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2. Con: The radioactive impact of the atomic attack was relatively small.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Today, Nagasaki and Hiroshima are cities with [normal](http://www.rerf.jp/general/qa_e/qa12.html) levels of radiation showing that the radioactive impact did not last long.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: A comparison to Tchernobyl shows that the radioactive impact was only short lived
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: The bomb of Hiroshima detonated at [high altitude](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/patrick-takahashi/why-worry-about-fukushima_b_847250.html) preventing radioactive materials from reaching the city.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.3. Pro: After the Hiroshima bombing the radiation spread over a wide area due to strong [wind](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/kids/KPSH_E/hiroshima_e/sadako_e/subcontents_e/08higai_4_e.html).
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.3.1. Con: This is bad as well, it means that even more land has been contaminated.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.3.1.1. Con: Because the radiation disappeared very quickly, every day the particles remained in the air weakened the human impact.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The radiation quickly disappeared. One week after the blast it was down to only one millionth the original [dose](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/kids/KPSH_E/question_box/question12.html).
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Radiation cannot disappear, it just can spread out to another place.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Radiation is not dangerous within certain boundaries. Once these are reached, it does not matter if radiation disappears completely.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.4. Pro: The two bombs, Little Boy and Fat Man, used only little [fissile material](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/patrick-takahashi/why-worry-about-fukushima_b_847250.html).
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.3.1.1.1.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.6. Con: The "[initial radiation](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/kids/KPSH_E/question_box/question12.html)" \(radiation that was released the instant the bomb exploded\) did tremendous damage to human bodies. Nearly everyone who was directly exposed within one kilometer of the hypocenter received enough radiation to kill them.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.6.1. Con: Because everything within two kilometers was [destroyed](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/kids/KPSH_E/question_box/question12.html) anyway, the radiation did not add much to the devastation.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.3. Con: Out of the 100.000 atomic survivors only [853 cases](http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/04/11/11greenwire-hiroshima-and-nagasaki-cast-long-shadows-over-99849.html?pagewanted=all) of cancerous tumors can be attributed to the bombs.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.4. Pro: Survivors suffered from negative effects other than the blast.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.4.1. Pro: [Psychological](http://history105.libraries.wsu.edu/fall2014/2014/08/29/atomicbombs/) damage to the survivors included post traumatic stress disorder.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.4.2. Pro: [Survivors](http://atomicbombmuseum.org/4_survivors.shtml) were stigmatized and excluded from social life.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.4.3. Pro: A-bomb [orphans](http://atomicbombmuseum.org/4_survivors.shtml) were left without help by their parents and became homeless.
1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.4.4. Pro: Many [elderly](http://atomicbombmuseum.org/4_survivors.shtml) lost their spouses or children they relied upon for support, making them highly vulnerable.
1.4.7.3.1.1.4. Pro: [120.000 people](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/) lost their lives in the first firebombing raid on Tokyo while "only" [75.000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Bombing_of_Hiroshima) people died on the day of the Hiroshima nuclear bombing.
1.4.7.3.1.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.
1.4.7.3.1.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.3.
1.4.7.3.1.1.5. Pro: The death toll of a normal bombing campaign on Tokyo, also called a fire bombing, would have been unimaginably high. Tokyo was densely populated and wooden.
1.4.7.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.
1.4.7.3.1.3. Pro: The radiation set free by nuclear bombs causes [cancer](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/intheworkplace/cancer-among-military-personnel-exposed-to-nuclear-weapons).
1.4.7.3.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.3.
1.4.7.3.1.3.2. Pro: Between 1957 and 1987 the [liver cancer rate](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7917541) in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the highest in the world.
1.4.7.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: Radiation can cause [cancer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20793/) in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest.
1.4.7.3.1.3.3. Con: Between 1957 and 1987 the [breast cancer rate](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7917541) in Nagasaki and Hiroshima was lowest in the world.
1.4.7.3.1.3.3.1. Con: But the incidence rate has [doubled since the 1960s](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7917541).
1.4.7.3.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.3.2.1.
1.4.7.3.1.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.3.2.1.
1.4.7.3.1.3.4. Pro: Despite a gradual decrease, [gastric cancer](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7917541) remained the most common malignancy among males and females throughout the surveillance period, accounting for 24% of all cancers by the late 1980s.
1.4.7.3.1.3.5. Pro: The overall age-adjusted [cancer incidence has increased](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7917541) from 217 to 301 per 100,000 among males, and from 176 to 197 per 100,000 among females during the first 30 years of cancer registration.
1.4.7.3.1.3.6. Con: Only 9% of cancer deaths are attributable to [long term-effects](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~dinov/courses_students.dir/data.dir/AtomicBombSurvivorsData.htm) of radiation.
1.4.7.3.1.3.6.1. Con: Although mortality studies are valuable, the [accuracy](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~dinov/courses_students.dir/data.dir/AtomicBombSurvivorsData.htm#faq2) of cancer diagnoses from death certificates is limited and mortality studies provide little information about the occurrence of cancers with relatively high survival rates.
1.4.7.3.1.3.7. Pro: The [excess risk](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~dinov/courses_students.dir/data.dir/AtomicBombSurvivorsData.htm#faq2) for cancers other than leukemia continues today, and it seems likely that this excess risk will persist throughout the lifetime of the survivors.
1.4.7.3.1.3.8. Pro: Excess [cancer risk](http://www.rerf.jp/radefx/late_e/cancrisk.html) associated with radiation started to appear about ten years after the explosions highlighting the long-term effects.
1.4.7.3.1.3.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.3.2.1.
1.4.7.3.1.4. Pro: Nuclear weapons tests do have an extreme [negative effect](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/dec/12/nuclearindustry.climatechange) on climate and the ecosystem worldwide.
1.4.7.3.1.5. Pro: The genes of plants, animals and humans can [mutate](http://education.seattlepi.com/nuclear-bombs-affect-environment-6173.html).
1.4.7.3.1.5.1. Con: No genetic effects have been detected in a large sample of Hiroshima [offspring](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=KTyRjAN7btsC&pg=PT100&lpg=PT100&dq=%22No+genetic+effects+have+been+detected+in+a+large+sample%22&source=bl&ots=zYsOzAxQ3G&sig=ohrO9ge9jmyIF_jclFRcFqUKTQY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjH6vzmhODKAhUErJQKHUl7DqQQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=%22No%20genetic%20effects%20have%20been%20detected%20in%20a%20large%20sample%22&f=false).
1.4.7.3.1.6. Pro: Conventional bombs are weaker than nuclear bombs, as the amount of dropped ordnance required to get the same effect is much higher.
1.4.7.3.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.2.
1.4.7.3.2. Con: The atomic bomb [differed from previous bombs](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/kids/KPSH_E/hiroshima_e/sadako_e/subcontents_e/08higai_4_e.html) that used chemical explosives. It emitted energy at an entirely different level of magnitude, and it also emitted radiation.
1.4.7.3.2.1. Pro: Later on [residual radiation](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/kids/KPSH_E/hiroshima_e/sadako_e/subcontents_e/08higai_4_e.html) remained in the city. Because of this, even people who were not directly exposed but who came near the hypocenter for rescue and relief operations or to search for their families absorbed radiation. Many fell ill and some died.
1.4.7.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.
1.4.7.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.3.2.2.6.
1.4.7.3.3. Pro: The bombing of Hiroshima ranked only fourth in terms of destruction of [cityscape](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/).
1.4.7.3.4. Con: "...the atomic bomb was more than a weapon of terrible destruction; it was a psychological weapon." [Henry L. Stimson](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/ps/japan/stimson_harpers.pdf), former secretary of war, said, the US perceived the atomic bomb not only as physically destructive weapon, but emphasized the psychological aspects of it.
1.4.7.3.4.1. Con: The dropping of the bomb did not have a strong psychological impact on the Japanese.
1.4.7.3.4.1.1. Pro: Because it was the first ever used A-bomb the magnitude of destruction was not well understood by the Japanese.
1.4.7.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: The nuclear program of the Japanese was in its infancy with little knowledge about the bomb. Thus we can assume that the actual test was very impressive.
1.4.7.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The Japanese had a well established nuclear [research](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=MwD44jnjmmsC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=Heavy+water+and+the+wartime+race+for+nuclear+energy&source=bl&ots=QTBVHy8YWe&sig=DuNgnElf8FvZnNeL2I5w1uwpbF8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiF8df7sqjKAhUDVZQKHRazBFoQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&q=Nishina&f=false) facility, so they knew about the military potential.
1.4.7.3.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Japan managed to built the first working [cyclotron](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=MwD44jnjmmsC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=Heavy+water+and+the+wartime+race+for+nuclear+energy&source=bl&ots=QTBVHy8YWe&sig=DuNgnElf8FvZnNeL2I5w1uwpbF8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiF8df7sqjKAhUDVZQKHRazBFoQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&q=Nishina&f=false) outside the US in 1937 indicating their advances in nuclear science.
1.4.7.3.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: By May 1945 the research facilities were [dissolved](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=MwD44jnjmmsC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=Heavy+water+and+the+wartime+race+for+nuclear+energy&source=bl&ots=QTBVHy8YWe&sig=DuNgnElf8FvZnNeL2I5w1uwpbF8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiF8df7sqjKAhUDVZQKHRazBFoQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&q=Nishina&f=false) because they did not yield sufficient progress.
1.4.7.3.4.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: In 1940 top researcher [Yoshio Nishina](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=3MKRAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=Scientific+Research+In+World+War+II&source=bl&ots=Rz-q7GXDG-&sig=mqdq8WDo97OcZzOGkhUFB0X6Ib8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiiwbbGtajKAhVG2KYKHXf4BUIQ6AEIPTAG#v=onepage&q&f=false) told Takeu Yasuda, Lieutenant General, about the potential, thus the military knew.
1.4.7.3.4.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: With the Ni-Go Project and the [F-Go Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_nuclear_weapon_program#Ni-Go_Project) Japan undertook two attempts to build a bomb on its own.
1.4.7.3.4.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: The military was well aware of nuclear research as it funded the [Ni-Go Project](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=3MKRAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=Scientific+Research+In+World+War+II&source=bl&ots=Rz-q7GXDG-&sig=mqdq8WDo97OcZzOGkhUFB0X6Ib8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiiwbbGtajKAhVG2KYKHXf4BUIQ6AEIPTAG#v=onepage&q&f=false) with 2,700,000 Yen.
1.4.7.3.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: The tidings of a new, very destructive weapon is very impressive if no prior information was available. In WWI, for example, France was impressed by the destructiveness of modern warfare and quickly changed uniforms of [metal armored](http://i.imgur.com/rwcNV1y.jpg) cavalry.
1.4.7.3.4.1.1.1.3. Pro: The Japanese were [skeptical](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=MwD44jnjmmsC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=Heavy+water+and+the+wartime+race+for+nuclear+energy&source=bl&ots=QTBVHy8YWe&sig=DuNgnElf8FvZnNeL2I5w1uwpbF8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiF8df7sqjKAhUDVZQKHRazBFoQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&q=Nishina&f=false) that the US would be able to build a nuclear bomb and would have taken it for a bluff.
1.4.7.3.4.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.5.
1.4.7.3.4.1.2. Pro: After the bombing of Hiroshima, the Japanese leadership did not express serious concern and instead emphasised the need to endure.
1.4.7.3.4.1.2.1. Con: The Supreme Council in Japan met the morning of the bombing of Nagasaki to discuss surrender, [Independent of the bombing of Nagasaki](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/) and too late after the bombing of Hiroshima for either bomb to have been a reason to call the meeting for surrender
1.4.7.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.4.7.3.4.1.2.3. Pro: Foreign Minister [Shidehara Kijuro](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=70ZRhKAHM4oC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=%22the+people+would+gradually+get+used+to+being+bombed+daily.+In+time+their+unity+and+resolve+would+grow+stronger%22&source=bl&ots=kZYAbIjUwG&sig=aBYY0b3e7x7DzVCNr4CSt9pONGs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5-f6IkJfKAhVJFpQKHbLnALQQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=%22the%20people%20would%20gradually%20get%20used%20to%20being%20bombed%20daily.%20In%20time%20their%20unity%20and%20resolve%20would%20grow%20stronger%22&f=false) claimed that "the people would gradually get used to being bombed". This shows that he was not very concerned.
1.4.7.3.4.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.4.7.3.4.1.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.
1.4.7.3.4.1.3. Pro: The [public](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ElFCBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=hiroshima+dowers+embracing+defeat&source=bl&ots=Pq07H72Tdx&sig=Gf948i1NwD2NEzDCIYFsusO-D4Q&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjvhfbD-6XKAhUFW5QKHfKiBWc4ChDoAQgkMAE#v=onepage&q=hiroshima%20dowers%20embracing%20defeat&f=false) was not well informed, because the release by the war ministry only spoke obscurely of a 'new bomb'.
1.4.7.3.4.1.4. Con: The Emperor's closest adviser [Koichi Kido](http://www.mconway.net/page1/page15/files/Shock%20of%20Atomic%20Bomb.pdf) spoke of a 'psychological shock'.
1.4.7.3.4.1.5. Con: Individuals experienced [horror](http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/LastAidLifton.pdf) in the aftermath of the bombing.
1.4.7.3.4.1.5.1. Con: Individual experiences are not a good measure for the destructive power of a weapon as even rudimentary tools can cause horror to individuals.
1.4.7.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.4.1.5.
1.4.7.3.5. Pro: Before the nuclear bombs were dropped, [66 cities](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/) had already been completely destroyed by conventional bombing.
1.4.7.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.
1.4.7.3.7. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.6.
1.4.7.4. Pro: All that was needed was one well educated crew and one airplane to bring devastating destruction.
1.4.7.4.1. Con: One also needed fissile material, which was not exactly in large supply in 1945, humans only recently having learned how to make large quantities of it.
1.4.8. Con: Japan had already made attempts to surrender. The bomb in itself was not necessary but merely peace-oriented negotiation tactics.
1.4.8.1. Con: Japan had made overtures to accept peace at very different terms than what the US was offering but it was debatable whether the supreme council would even have accepted those.  Japan had to be convinced to accept the US terms and the atomic bombs, combined with Russia's entry in the war, did that.   Japan would not otherwise have surrendered on terms the US would accept.
1.4.8.1.1. Con: Japan [offered](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_Weber.html) surrender on terms that were nearly identical to the terms of the US; only saving the Emperor.
1.4.8.1.1.1. Pro: As the US occupation force followed to the initial proposal by Japan later on and kept the Emperor the difference in surrender terms between the US and Japan cannot be seen as major obstacle to finding a negotiated agreement.
1.4.8.1.1.2. Con: Japan had attacked the United States first at Pearl Harbor by order of Emperor Hirohito. The US felt the Emperor, as a Shinto deity, was personally responsible for many millions of people who had been killed in the war, and that it was immoral to allow him to continue to rule as deity and potentially be the cause of future wars.
1.4.8.1.1.2.1. Con: Some months before Pearl Harbor Hirohito is quoted to have said that an attack "[is nothing less than a self-destructive war](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/world/asia/before-pearl-harbor-japans-emperor-cautioned-against-war-with-us-documents-show.html)". Apparently he was not driven by a desire to attack the US.
1.4.8.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Although Emperor Hirohito initially opposed the war, this was unknown in the US at the time, and[he did eventually give his approval for the war and to attack Pearl Harbor](http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/meyers/controversial-wikipedia-corpus/english-html/main/main_0322.html).
1.4.8.1.1.2.2. Pro: The aerial bombing of civilian targets, the rape of Nanking, the mutilation of Englishmen in Malay and the Bataan Death March were hyped in [US media](http://www.amazon.com/Prompt-Utter-Destruction-Truman-against/dp/1442994754).
1.4.8.1.1.2.3. Pro: [The United States considered Japan's military actions to gain additional natural resources rogue.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2014/07/07/what_prompted_japan_s_aggression_before_and_during_world_war_ii.html)
1.4.8.1.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.1.1.2.1.1.
1.4.8.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.9.2.
1.4.8.2. Con: Absolute victory was necessary as a psychological purge and thereby improving the odds of a successful occupation.
1.4.8.2.1. Pro: Utter defeat illustrated that a militaristic sense of national destiny was unlikely to lead to success.
1.4.8.2.2. Pro: State Department's Hiss and leftist Asia specialist Bisson emphasized how 'total victory' is necessary \([Dower, p. 57](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\). This illustrates how widespread this opinion was in the political discourse.
1.4.8.2.3. Con: Four out of Five Japanese POWs showed "remarkable cooperation" \([Dower, p.77](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\). From this it could have been estimated that Japan as a whole would be cooperative during the occupation.
1.4.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.4.8.4. Pro: In April and May 1945, Japan made three [attempts](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_Weber.html) through neutral Sweden and Portugal to bring the war to a peaceful end.
1.4.8.4.1. Con: Yes, but at very different terms than what the US would accept.
1.4.8.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.2.
1.4.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.1.1.
1.4.9. Con: Allowing Japan to retain the Emperor would have terminated the war immediately and the Americans knew it. Thus, alternatives were available.
1.4.9.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.3.1.
1.4.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.
1.4.9.3. Con: -> See 1.4.8.1.1.2.
1.4.9.4. Con: Under Imperial rule the Japanese people had been brainwashed and trained to fight the American invaders to the last man, woman, and child. Allowing Japan to surrender and retain the Emperor was thus too dangerous to accept.
1.4.9.4.1. Pro: [Military training courses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Empire_of_Japan) were part of the general education.
1.4.9.4.2. Pro: The Japanese government issued the [Kokutai No Hongi](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1950-04-01/kokutai-no-hongi-cardinal-principles-national-entity-japan) to make the youth believe in the nationalistic cause.
1.4.9.4.3. Con: This cannot be true because this is precisely what did in fact happen: the US and the other Allies accepted Japan's surrender with the implicit reassurance given on August 12 that the Emperor will stay \("The ultimate form of government of Japan shall, in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration, be established by the freely expressed will of the Japanese people."\). This eventually enabled the Emperor and the Japanese cabinet to accept these terms.
1.4.9.5. Con: Allowing Japan to retain the Emperor was not a tenable option from the US perspective since leaving the leader of Japan intact would have been seen as principal weakness on the part of the US. Imperial Japan was not going to end if the Emperor was still formally on the throne.
1.4.9.5.1. Con: The US left the leaders of Imperial Germany in place after WWI and were victorious nevertheless.
1.4.9.5.2. Con: US leaders left the Japanese emperor in power after the war.
1.4.10. Con: The US had major military capabilities that rendered the nuclear bombs less important.
1.4.10.1. Pro: Many informed, senior officers of the US military agreed, that there was no military necessity for the use of nuclear weapons.
1.4.10.1.1. Pro: As Dwight D. Eisenhower put it, [Japan was already defeated](http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0806-25.htm) and the dropping of the A-bombs was completely unnecessary.
1.4.10.1.1.1. Con: This statement was made afterwards and is therefore not legitimate to assess the military assessment at the time of decision-making.
1.4.10.1.1.2. Con: There is no record of any senior officer neglecting the necessity before it was dropped. So there is no evidence that there was an agreement that the bomb was unnecessary from a military perspective.
1.4.10.1.2. Pro: Henry H. Arnold, Commanding General of the US Army Air Forces stated, that the [Japanese position was hopeless](http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0806-25.htm) even before the first A-bombs fell, because the Japanese had already lost control of their own air.
1.4.10.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.1.
1.4.10.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.2.
1.4.10.1.3. Pro: Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the US Pacific fleet found, that the A-bombs [played no decisive part](http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0806-25.htm), from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan.
1.4.10.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.1.
1.4.10.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.2.
1.4.10.1.4. Pro: Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Truman stated, that the use of the A-bombs was [no material assistance](http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0806-25.htm) in the war against Japan.
1.4.10.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.1.
1.4.10.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.2.
1.4.10.1.5. Pro: The [US Strategic Bombing Survey](http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0806-25.htm) reported, that certainly prior to December 1945, and in all probability prior to November 1st 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the A-bombs had not been dropped.
1.4.10.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.1.
1.4.10.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.2.
1.4.10.1.6. Con: All of Roosevelt's advisers who knew about the bomb always [unquestioningly](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) assumed that it would be used.
1.4.10.1.7. Pro: General [Marshall](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) told Secretary Stimson on May 29 that the A-bomb should first be used not against civilians but against military installations.
1.4.10.1.7.1. Con: Marshall's skepticism of using the bomb was not [decisive](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) in light of widespread unequivocal support for dropping it.
1.4.10.1.8. Con: Roosevelt's top political [aide](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered), Truman and Byrnes, had no desire to avoid its use.
1.4.10.1.9. Con: US politicians and scientists alike were [determined](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) to use it, regardless of military necessities.
1.4.10.1.9.1. Con: Calculating military necessity did play a role in deciding to drop the bomb, as the overall conduct of war changed during WWII. Broad areal bombings with many civilian casualties made crossing the line to a single broad strike very easy. [1\)](https://michiganjournalhistory.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/oh_jung.pdf)
1.4.10.1.10. Con: Of the examples that the US military leadership agreed that there was no necessity, none is from before [August 1945](http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0806-25.htm).
1.4.10.1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.7.
1.4.10.2. Pro: The bombings were part of an already [fierce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Debate_over_bombings) conventional bombing campaign. Combined with the sea blockade and the collapse of Germany, this favored the U.S. in military capabilities. The use of nuclear weapons was thus not necessary from a military perspective.
1.4.10.3. Pro: The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki could have been equally well accomplished using traditional or fire bombing.
1.4.10.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.
1.4.10.3.2. Con: Fire bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was considered likely and even expected. It would not have obviated the need for full-scale invasion of Japan costing many lives on both sides. Hence it would not have equally well accomplished the atomic bombing goals.
1.4.10.4. Con: -> See 1.2.9.6.3.1.1.
1.4.10.5. Con: After the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, there was a strategic need for a military strike against Japan. As the U.S. Navy was inferior to the Japanese one and the American ground troops were busy in Europe, the nuclear strike was a necessary move to make Japan surrender.
1.4.10.5.1. Con: The US could have waited for military support from the Soviet Union.
1.4.10.5.1.1. Con: Waiting for the Soviets would open up the possibility of a Soviet occupation. Given the impact of Soviet Policies on East Germany \(oppression, economic stagnation, suppression of human rights\), a Soviet occupation would have entailed large costs to the Japanese people.
1.4.10.5.2. Con: The US was aware of the Japanese military [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_\(cipher_machine\)), giving it a decisive intelligence advantage.
1.4.10.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.9.6.3.1.1.4.1.1.
1.4.10.5.4. Con: The US Navy had the advantage over the Japanese navy.
1.4.10.5.4.1. Pro: It took only 4 months after Pearl Harbor for the US Pacific Command to bomb Tokyo in the [Doolittle Raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolittle_Raid).
1.4.10.5.4.2. Pro: After the [defeat at Midway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway) the Japanese Navy was on the retreat in the Pacific.
1.4.10.5.4.3. Pro: The [Guadalcanal Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalcanal_Campaign) showed the strong advances of the US navy.
1.4.10.5.5. Con: At this point the Japanese Navy was [very weak](http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0806-25.htm).
1.4.10.5.6. Con: Ground troops from Europe had already been [re-deployed](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=GdO6-uSguIUC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=japanese+troops+on+honshu&source=bl&ots=IcVrQ4nbXT&sig=Rsa9d6hAu17YGK749c9bdssZ4vc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyu97ZypnKAhWEdKYKHX4_A2MQ6AEINzAF#v=onepage&q&f=false) to participate in combat in the Pacific.
1.4.10.5.7. Pro: [Dropping the A-bomb](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/mp06.asp) on the port cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had a significant strategic military purpose, i.e. greatly damaging the naval forces of Japan, because regular bombing manoeuvres had little impact on the targets.
1.4.10.5.7.1. Pro: Nagasaki was of strategic military value. It was home to major Mitsubishi shipbuilding facilities and port to coal from underwater mines such as [Battleship Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima_Island).
1.4.10.5.7.2. Pro: The city of Nagasaki had been one of the largest sea ports in southern Japan. [avalon.law.yale.edu](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/mp06.asp)
1.4.10.5.7.3. Pro: Hiroshima was a city of considerable military importance. It contained the [2nd Army Headquarters](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/mp06.asp), which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan.
1.4.10.5.7.4. Pro: [Nagasaki](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/mp06.asp) was of great war-time importance because of its many and varied industries, including the production of ordnance, ships, military equipment, and other war materials.
1.4.10.5.7.5. Con: -> See 1.4.10.5.5.
1.4.10.5.7.6. Con: The nuclear bombs hit Nagasaki and Hiroshima on land far away from sea. Thus, they did not target naval forces nor did the effects reach the [harbor](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/).
1.4.11. Con: The bombing was a diplomatic tactic in negotiating with the [Soviets](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7706-hiroshima-bomb-may-have-carried-hidden-agenda/) and had little implication for Japan.
1.4.11.1. Con: The [main target](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/10/04/atomic-bomb-used-nazi-germany/) of the atomic bomb, early on, was Nazi Germany. However, the technology was not available before Hitler surrendered.
1.4.11.1.1. Con: Japan was selected to be a better [target](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb525-The-Atomic-Bomb-and-the-End-of-World-War-II/documents/003.pdf) than Nazi Germany in 1943.
1.4.11.1.1.1. Pro: Japan was chosen, because of the [construction of its buildings](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/10/04/atomic-bomb-used-nazi-germany/). They were likely to be more damaged by the bomb than the ones in Germany.
1.4.11.1.1.2. Pro: Germany's [aerial defense](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/10/04/atomic-bomb-used-nazi-germany/) system was too strong.
1.4.11.1.1.2.1. Con: Germany's aerial defense system was not able to prevent aerial bombings which suggests that it was no more difficult to deliver an atomic bomb.
1.4.11.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: At the bombing of Berlin in 1943 only 26 of 764 bombers were lost. This percentage decreased further as the [Luftwaffe](http://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=55/Bombing-of-Hamburg-Dresden-and-Other-Cities-World-War-II-Database) lost in power towards 1945.
1.4.11.1.1.2.2. Con: That the Japanese air force might interfere with the bomber was considered a major factor by [Bernstein](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered).
1.4.11.1.1.3. Pro: Neither the [USSR nor Nazi Germany](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/10/04/atomic-bomb-used-nazi-germany/) could have been serious targets, because the US was concerned they might salvage the bomb in case of a misfire, extract the technology and put it to their own use.
1.4.11.1.2. Con: If this were true, it would not change the fact that wherever it dropped, it would be useful as a tool for negotiating with the Soviets.
1.4.11.2. Con: Japan could have been defeated through other means but the U.S. had to make a "threat" against the Soviet Union in light of the Soviet prolifeartion which was equal if not more advanced than the US; Mutually Assured Destruction meant that both sides had to threaten each other indirectly and through the power of suggestion...
1.4.11.3. Pro: The US had reasons to fear that continued war will result in a divided Japan, just like Germany. This would have created yet another source of tension during the upcoming Cold War.
1.4.11.4. Pro: The display of force helped the U.S. position itself for the approaching Cold War.
1.4.11.4.1. Con: Following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Stalin ordered Soviet scientists to [rapidly increase](https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/soviet-atomic-program-1946) the speed and scope of their own nuclear weapons program, thus diminishing the time during which America had a nuclear monopoly.
1.4.11.4.2. Pro: Bombing a city carries much more weight than launching threats.
1.4.11.4.2.1. Pro: With dropping two atomic bombs on two Japanese cities, the US did make a kind of "statement" about their commitment in winning this war by all means.
1.4.11.4.2.2. Pro: The first bomb [proved](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) its existence; the second one was proof that there were more. This is much more effective than mere threats.
1.4.11.4.2.2.1. Pro: Marcus McDilda, a captured pilot, "confessed" under torture that the U.S. had [100 atomic bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes#cite_note-100) and that Tokyo and Kyoto were the next targets. McDilda's false confession may have swayed the Japanese leaders' decision to surrender.
1.4.11.4.2.2.2. Pro: The show of force was necessary to back up the [bluff](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) that there are more nuclear weapons where in fact were none.
1.4.11.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: The Japanese navy [questioned](http://www.mconway.net/page1/page15/files/Shock%20of%20Atomic%20Bomb.pdf) "whether the United States will be able to use more bombs in rapid succession".
1.4.11.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: The army minister thought the US would posses no more [bombs](http://www.mconway.net/page1/page15/files/Shock%20of%20Atomic%20Bomb.pdf) after Hiroshima.
1.4.11.4.2.2.3. Con: The second bomb was not proof that there were more, but just that the US had two nuclear bombs.
1.4.11.4.3. Pro: To rise as a world power, the U.S. had to demonstrate the destructive force of the bomb by at least using it once.
1.4.11.4.3.1. Pro: The selection of the target was guided by the goal of making the "initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be [internationally](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=uwYAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=sherwin+how+well+they+meant+it&source=bl&ots=6ac500veqa&sig=SXcTZBjp4HclrHIqXGFoJBlJBng&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiS-M2I08vKAhWkKaYKHbutCHUQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=sherwin%20how%20well%20they%20meant%20it&f=false) recognized".
1.4.11.4.3.1.1. Con: Surely any first use of a nuclear weapon in war would grip the attention of the world, regardless of the target.
1.4.11.4.3.2. Con: The U.S. could have acheived the same effect if they had dropped the bombs in relatively uninhabited areas.
1.4.11.4.3.2.1. Con: Bombing a city is more illustrative than bombing less inhabited areas and thus makes for a more impressive demonstration of force.
1.4.11.4.3.2.2. Con: Effects of nuclear bombings in less inhabited areas are more difficult to assess because less physical destruction takes place.
1.4.11.4.3.2.3. Con: Scientists were uncertain about how many civilians would be killed by [radiation](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered).
1.4.11.4.3.2.4. Pro: The destructive powers of nuclear weapons would have been equally visible but less people would have been killed immediately.
1.4.11.4.3.2.4.1. Con: This would have removed the extent to which the public - and other countries' governments - understood the true power of the weapons.
1.4.11.4.3.2.5. Con: Just as it was doubted that the bomb is effective against armies it was not clear that it would be effective against a city without testing in a real scenario.
1.4.11.4.3.2.5.1. Pro: Even though expected, the actual test gives more certainty in the effectiveness against armies and navies.
1.4.11.4.3.2.5.1.1. Pro: The Soviet Union conducted the [Totskoye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totskoye_nuclear_exercise) nuclear exercise because Stalin doubted A-bombs would be useful on targets other than cities.
1.4.11.4.3.2.5.1.2. Pro: In the US [Operation Plombobb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbbob) the effect on actual armies was tested.
1.4.11.4.3.2.5.1.3. Pro: [Operation Crossroads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Crossroads) showed that results of nuclear destruction can stay behind expectations.
1.4.11.4.3.2.5.1.4. Pro: To be certain about the effects of nuclear explosions on submarines the US conducted [Operation Wigwam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wigwam).
1.4.11.4.4. Pro: U.S. President Truman felt that the Soviet Union did not recognize the [potential](http://www.dannen.com/decision/potsdam.html) of the nuclear bomb after Stalin answered indifferently to its revelation.
1.4.11.4.4.1. Pro: The linked accounts note that it was not described as a nuclear or atomic bomb, but just "a new weapon of unusual destructive force". Stalin may well have not realized what he was hearing about and would need to see its power to realize what "unusual" meant.
1.4.11.4.4.1.1. Con: Stalin knew that this new weapon was an atomic bomb, and he understood its capabilities, thanks to his network of [spies](https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/Events/1942-1945/espionage.htm) in the Manhattan Project.
1.4.11.4.5. Con: The fact that the US gained other benefits from the attack does not mean that they were the primary motivation in carrying it out.
1.4.11.5. Pro: [Alperovitz](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Atomic_diplomacy.html?id=81waAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y) argues that the possibility of atomic diplomacy was central to the thinking of Truman and his advisers.
1.4.11.6. Pro: After successfully testing the bomb and with that having the new weapon ready for use, the U.S. had a new way to deal with the Soviets, making Soviet involvement in Japan [obsolete and undesirable](http://www.uky.edu/Centers/Asia/SECAAS/Seras/2009/25_Yagami_2009.pdf).
1.4.11.6.1. Con: The U.S. [encouraged](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1962-07-01/soviet-intervention-war-japan) a Soviet entry into the war.
1.4.11.6.1.1. Con: The US encouraged a Soviet entry [before](http://www.uky.edu/Centers/Asia/SECAAS/Seras/2009/25_Yagami_2009.pdf) the A-bomb was developed and tested successfully.
1.4.11.6.1.1.1. Pro: Once the Manhattan Project was successfully tested Truman believed the Japanese would surrender [before](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/primary-resources/truman-diary/) the Russians could join the war.
1.4.11.7. Con: In U.S.-Soviet negotiations about Japanese surrender and composition of Supreme Command the nuclear bomb was not [mentioned](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/68.pdf).
1.4.11.7.1. Pro: The US ambassador pointed to the [sacrifices](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/68.pdf) for victory instead of power coming from the nuclear bomb as justification for post war influence.
1.4.11.7.2. Con: This was 1945 and Japan was at war. It likely would have taken more than 4 days just to produce a report on the effects of the bomb confirming it was real and devastating.[history.com](http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/bombing-of-hiroshima-and-nagasaki)
1.4.11.8. Pro: [Bernstein](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) suggests that the ability to “cow other nations, notably the Soviet Union” was a “bonus” effect to the bomb.
1.4.11.8.1. Con: Bernstein himself argued that the [major intention](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) of the bomb was to end the war quickly and not to deal with the Russians.
1.4.11.8.2. Pro: The possession of nuclear bombs was considered a diplomatic '[royal straight flush](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/7.pdf)' in negotiations with Stalin.
1.4.11.8.2.1. Pro: The intimidation of the Soviets by the bomb was a desired objective, rendering them, as Roosevelt's top aide [Byrnes](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) said, "more manageable."
1.4.11.8.3. Pro: Even if the bombs were not the sole reason for Japanese surrender, they showed the will of the US to use atomic bombs against other nations, thus putting them in a position of power \(beginning with the drop of atomic bombs\) for the following time period up to today, since every nation trying to oppose the U.S. military has to anticipate their willingness to launch atomic bombs.
1.4.11.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.4.3.
1.4.11.8.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.4.2.
1.4.11.8.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.4.3.1.
1.4.11.9. Pro: Indicating that the [Soviets](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/13.pdf) had priority in U.S. military thinking, the U.S. considered leaving Japan with Taiwan and Korea to check 'Soviet expansion'.
1.4.11.10. Con: After forcing Japan's unconditional surrender, it was known that there would be no need for diplomacy with Japan.
1.4.11.11. Con: Just because dropping the bomb had external value does not mean it was not necessary to end the war with Japan.
1.4.11.11.1. Pro: Ignoring the implications for Japan of dropping the bomb is simplistic, there were embryonic cold war concerns, but these should not be pulled into the foreground the exclusion of all others. The lives of Allied servicemen, the potential slaughter of Japanese civilians in case of an invasion, Winning the war in the quickest way possible are all important factors among many others. None should be cherry picked or ignored.
1.4.11.11.2. Pro: The claim [The bombing was a...](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1108.264), as written, is almost as irrelevant as saying "2+3=5." Thus, it does not matter how "true" it is; it has little to no impact.
1.4.12. Con: This claim is a counter-factual. It is impossible to know for sure what "could convince Japan." Neither you nor I can see all possible futures. The strongest claim you can make is that "Only the use of nuclear bombs was likely to convince Japan to surrender." But even the weaker claim is false, as every other war in Japanese history was ended without resort to nuclear power, and therefore it is likely that a non-nuclear solution was possible for this war too.
1.4.12.1. Con: Most of the past wars of Japan were not cases of [total war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_war), in which almost the entire able civilian population was mobilized through economic, cultural, and political channels into supporting the war effort.
Pithily put, your appeal to empirics ignores the new empire.
1.4.13. Pro: [Japan entered the war to obtain resources](http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2014/07/07/what_prompted_japan_s_aggression_before_and_during_world_war_ii.html) that were considered necessary for its continuing sovereign existence among world powers. Japan would not have backed down without an equally pressing existential threat.
1.4.14. Pro: The simple fact that Japan did not surrender after the *first* bomb implies that it would have taken something unfathomably extreme to get them to surrender otherwise.
1.4.14.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.5. Con: The bombs were not dropped out of necessity to end the war, but rather to justify the $2 billion cost of the [Manhattan Project](http://www.uky.edu/Centers/Asia/SECAAS/Seras/2009/25_Yagami_2009.pdf).
1.5.1. Con: Your source does not actually say this was *the* reason. In fact, your source appears to just be doing a literature review on other sources, and even the specific source for that argument \(Sherwin\) also lists three other reasons.
1.5.2. Pro: Not only that, but also using these expenses to end the war right away and not having to spend any more money on it.
1.5.3. Con: Governments rarely attempt to justify the outrageous spending costs they incur; especially military expenditures. There is no reason to think the Manhattan project would be an exception.  War by its nature is costly, and ending the war - and preventing American deaths - would have been an expense the US citizenry would have accepted regardless.
1.5.4. Con: The project was hugely expensive but so was the war in general. There is no credible evidence to suggest that the bombs would have been dropped to justify the expense had the Japanese surrendered on the US' terms.
1.5.5. Pro: Dropping the bombs on relatively uninhabited areas would have equally justified the $2-billion cost of the Manhattan Project.
1.5.5.1. Con: In uninhabited areas the full destructive effects cannot be measured.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.4.3.2.3.
1.5.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.4.3.2.2.
1.5.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.4.3.2.5.
1.5.5.2. Con: Roosevelt was considering testing the bomb in [America](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) with Japanese observers present but this was not considered a real option.
1.5.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.4.3.2.4.
1.5.5.4. Con: -> See 1.4.11.4.3.2.1.
1.5.5.5. Con: The risk of failure when dropping it in an uninhabited area was considered too great.
1.5.5.5.1. Pro: An interim committee on target selection feared that dropping the A-bomb in uninhabited areas might not adequately [impress](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) the Japanese militarists.
1.5.5.5.2. Pro: The bomb would have incinerated any Allied [Prisoners of War](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) whom the Japanese might have had placed in uninhabited areas.
1.5.5.5.2.1. Pro: Allied [POWs](http://histclo.com/essay/war/ww2/pow/pow-jap.html) were an important consideration for the US leadership given that they created a fund to support them already in 1944.
1.5.5.5.2.2. Con: There were POWs in [Hiroshima](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/world/asia/hiroshima-obama-visit-shigeaki-mori.html?_r=1) too.
1.5.5.6. Pro: The [Franck Report](http://www.dannen.com/decision/franck.html) urged that the bomb be demonstrated "before the eyes of representatives of all United Nations, on the desert or a barren island.
1.5.5.6.1. Con: Despite the arguments in the Franck Report, a [panel](http://www.dannen.com/decision/scipanel.html) composed of Oppenheimer and others found "no acceptable alternative to direct military use."
1.5.5.7. Pro: In fact, the bomb was tested in uninhabited areas prior to the bombing of Japan.  Testing clearly wasn't the purpose of dropping the bomb.
1.5.5.7.1. Pro: Alamogordo, New Mexico, July 16, 1945, [Trinity Nuclear Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_\(nuclear_test\)). Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, roughly 20 days later. The destructive power of the bomb was well established.
1.5.6. Con: The facilities built for the Manhattan Project were made for large scale [industrial production](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/05/17/the-price-of-the-manhattan-project/) and not just for two bombs. Thus, dropping them was not required to justify them but the number of atomic bombs produced served as justification.
1.5.7. Con: It is not unusual to spend more on science when in war. This does not need a justification.
1.5.7.1. Pro: During WWII the US government became the general [supporter](https://ia801407.us.archive.org/20/items/historyofscience00unit/historyofscience00unit_bw.pdf) of science; including nuclear science. Thus the Manhattan project is just one in a wider war effort.
1.5.8. Con: In light of $1.3 trillion war time [deficit](http://federal-budget.insidegov.com/l/47/1945) in between 1941 and 1945, the development costs of the Manhattan project do not weigh much.
1.5.9. Con: The Manhattan Project was authorized by Roosevelt; thus Truman could easily blame his predecessor for misappropriation of funds.
1.5.9.1. Pro: [Truman](http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/truman-is-briefed-on-manhattan-project) was not informed about the existence of the nuclear program before April 12, 1945.
1.5.10. Con: Many experimental military projects end up costing huge amounts of money and not delivering, so spending $2 billion on the Manhattan Project would have been acceptable even without a clear result.
1.5.10.1. Con: Other experimental projects, like [Bat Bombs](http://www.cracked.com/article_15983_the-10-most-bizarre-military-experiments.html), were scrapped in expectation of the Manhattan Project. This created extra pressure for the nuclear bomb to work.
1.5.11. Con: Prior to the atomic bombing of Japan, no one would have doubted the success of the Manhattan Project, given the preceding successful nuclear weapon tests.
1.5.11.1. Pro: Nobody disputed the efficacy of nuclear weapons after seeing the results of the [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_%28nuclear_test%29) test explosions, three weeks before the nuclear bombing of Japan.
1.5.11.1.1. Con: The [Trinity test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_%28nuclear_test%29#Civilian_detection) was not made public.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.4.11.
1.7. Pro: The use of nuclear weapons was necessary to limit civilian and military human costs. If the U.S. stuck with conventional military strategies, many more lives would have been lost.
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.7.2. Pro: Because every month of [warfare](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~insrisg/bookmarks/bk01/1108downfall.htm) cost 200,000 Chinese lives, prolonged tactics would cause more casualties.
1.7.2.1. Pro: In China alone, during 1937–45, approximately [3.9 million Chinese were killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes#Mass_killings), mostly civilians, as a direct result of the Japanese operations \(40,000 per month\).
1.7.3. Pro: A prolonged strategy of blockade with bombing would have killed more than the nuclear bombings.
1.7.3.1. Pro: The [naval blockade](http://warontherocks.com/2013/10/talkin-world-war-ii-blockades-and-submarines-in-the-pacific/) of Japan would have continued leading to a lack in food supplies and starvation of the mainland population.
1.7.3.1.1. Pro: A number of key Navy and Army Air Force officers [argued](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/the-final-months-of-the-war-with-japan-signals-intelligence-u-s-invasion-planning-and-the-a-bomb-decision/csi9810001.html#rtoc8) that a combination of sea blockade and aerial bombardment could produce a Japanese surrender.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: The naval blockade [destroyed](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) major food supply ships, such as the [Mamiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_food_supply_ship_Mamiya), the entire [Muroto class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muroto-class_collier), or the [Nosaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_food_supply_ship_Nosaki), indicating its effectiveness to reduce supplies to the home islands.
1.7.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.6.3.1.1.4.1.1.
1.7.3.2. Pro: A prolonged war would have taken a heavy toll on [forced laborers](https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB3.1.GIF) of whom already about 400.000 died.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Because there was no need to continue fire or aerial bombing, many civilians in major cities were saved.
1.7.3.3.1. Pro: The [firebombing of Tokyo](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/03/10/national/deadly-wwii-u-s-firebombing-raids-on-japanese-cities-largely-ignored/) was just as deadly as Hiroshima and even deadlier than Nagasaki. As a whole the firebombings cost far more lives than the nukes. It was the terror nukes inspired that caused the surrender.
1.7.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.
1.7.4. Pro: Because an invasion of Japan would have resulted in many allied casualties, an early Japanese surrender was necessary.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Because Japanese soldiers were unlikely to surrender, any invasion or anti-guerrilla operation would have been extremely costly.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: Japanese soldiers were deterred from surrendering because the US generally didn't take prisoners of war.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: The 41st Division bragged that they didn't take prisoners \([Hartfield, p. 340](https://books.google.de/books?id=gALtBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA340&lpg=PA340&dq=the+41st+didn%27t+take+prisoners&source=bl&ots=07WcCAdJZ0&sig=U2KM093EnSij_qqRjJWJecl85go&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipj8Oh3-baAhWMQBQKHRbsB8MQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q=the%2041st%20didn't%20take%20prisoners&f=false)\).
1.7.4.1.1.2. Pro: 84% of interrogated Japanese POWs expected that once taken captive they'd be tortured and executed \([Dower, p. 68](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.7.4.1.1.3. Pro: The Marine battle cry on Tarawa was "Kill the Jap bastards! Take no prisoners!" \([Dower, p. 68](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.7.4.1.1.4. Con: The US generally took POWs.
1.7.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: Japanese historian Ikuhiko Hata found that up to 50.000 POWs were taken by the US before surrender \([Moore & Fedorowitch, p. 263](http://www.gbv.de/dms/goettingen/230513034.pdf)\).
1.7.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: The [Japanese wartime POW Information Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_prisoners_of_war_in_World_War_II#Prisoners_taken_during_the_war) listed 42.543 Japanese to have surrendered.
1.7.4.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: This figure was found to be right based on accounts of the US and Australian armed forces \([Ferguson, p. 164](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1191/0968344504wh291oa)\).
1.7.4.1.1.5. Con: [This article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_prisoners_of_war_in_World_War_II)states that many Japanese had a 'fight to the death' attitude, decreasing willingness to become POWs; also evidenced by kamikaze attacks.  Therefore, if the parent post is implying that the US refused to take Japanese as POWs, vs couldn't take them, I think it's mistaken.
1.7.4.1.2. Con: The Office of War Information concluded in April 1944 that Japanese fighting men could be 'persuaded' to surrender peacefully \([Dower, p.137](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.7.4.1.3. Pro: Because of Kamikaze attacks, the US was aware that Japanese soldiers were unlikely to surrender.
1.7.4.1.4. Pro: That the [majority](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) of Japanese casualties occurred in 1945, indicating that the Japanese would fight to the last even though virtually beaten.
1.7.4.1.5. Pro: The study of [Ruth Benedict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chrysanthemum_and_the_Sword) for the US military came to the conclusion that the Japanese follow their leader and thus will not surrender independently.
1.7.4.1.6. Pro: [Japanese soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_prisoners_of_war_in_World_War_II) were told to die in combat, because to surrender to the enemy was regarded as very dishonorable and a shame for the nation and the Tennõ.
1.7.4.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson [estimated](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/ps/japan/stimson_harpers.pdf) the casualties of an invasion would reach 1.000.000.
1.7.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.7.4.4. Pro: Japan's government and Hirohito decided to [draft](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/08/14/historians-soviet-offensive-key-japans-wwii-surrender-eclipsed-bombs.html) almost the entire population. As not sufficient uniforms were prepared the differentiation between civilians and soldiers would have been obscured and likely resulted in civilian suffering.
1.7.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.6.3.1.1.
1.7.4.6. Pro: In short, yes. Here's an interesting factoid: Half a million Purple Heart medals were produced for the Pentagon in anticipation of Operation Downfall \(q.v.\) - the conventional invasion of Japan planned for the autumn of 1945.  That inventory is still servicing awards related to the current actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.[historynewsnetwork.org](http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/1801)
1.7.4.7. Pro: Prior battles had shown the high number of casualties, which could have been expected.
1.7.4.7.1. Pro: At the [Battle of Tawara](http://www.honorstates.org/index.php?page=features&tid=1643) more than 6000 Japanese, Korean and US soldiers died.
1.7.4.7.2. Pro: [Iwo Jima](http://www.tamupress.com/product/Ghosts-of-Iwo-Jima,3173.aspx) showed that the Japanese, when dug in, could withstand superior manpower and technology leading to 7.000- 28.000 US casualties.
1.7.4.7.3. Pro: The [Battle of Okinawa](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) cost nearly 13.000 US soldiers' lives and presented a blueprint for what to expect when invading the Japanese home islands.
1.7.4.8. Pro: Around 140.000 allied [Prisoners of War](https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/prisoners-of-war-of-the-japanese-1939-1945) would have been at risk in case of an invasion.
1.7.4.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.5.2.1.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.4.9.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.6.
1.7.7. Pro: The estimates of the Americans killed in action \(up to 800,000\) and among the Japanese \(over 1 million\) show that the dropping of the bomb was a military necessity.
1.7.7.1. Con: There are no set or defined  human casualty limits in history over such "necessities"
1.7.8. Con: This is a counter-factual claim. Because we did not stick "with conventional military strategies," we have no way of knowing for sure how many lives would or would not have been lost. All we have are notoriously unreliable human projections, as opposed to perfect knowledge of the future.
1.7.8.1. Pro: Nuclear weapons may have limited the deaths involved in a ground invasion, but a ground invasion was still an option and being considered at the time. How long the war would have continued without nuclear weapons will forever remain unanswered.
1.7.8.2. Con: There is nothing wrong with counterfactual claims. To have a good model of a topic means that you are able to make counterfactual claims.
1.7.8.3. Con: Past experiences allow to extrapolate the costs of alternative actions.
1.7.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.
1.7.8.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.6.
1.7.8.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.7.
1.7.8.4. Con: -> See 1.7.4.8.
1.7.8.5. Con: US intelligence rather underestimated Japanese strength. A postwar comparison with Japanese data showed that intel underestimated aircraft production and overestimated combat losses \([Prados, p. 59](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317598/storm-over-leyte-by-john-prados/9780451473615/)\).
1.7.9. Pro: Dropping the bomb can be considered a humanitarian act, because more Japanese civilians would have died otherwise.
1.7.9.1. Con: Since USSR joined the war and Japan became limited to its homeland and Japans very limited resources, the use of nuclear weapons could wait for a month so the real picture of the situation could emerge and acted upon. For some reason, weapon use was hasted.
1.7.9.2. Con: High casualties were thought to be inevitable, but nobody knew with certainty how high. Several people made estimates, but they [varied widely in numbers, assumptions and purposes, which included advocating and opposing the invasion.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall#Estimated_casualties)
1.7.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.3.
1.7.9.4. Con: -> See 1.4.11.4.3.2.3.
1.7.10. Pro: The U.S. dropped 157,000 tons of conventional bombs on Japan. While estimates vary, there were between 241,000 and 900,000 Japanese killed with conventional bombs versus the total of 120,000 killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs. This would lead one to believe that due to Japan's refusal to admit defeat, conventional bombing would have cost many more lives.
1.8. Con: There was no pressing military need for dropping atomic bombs on Japan.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.9.1.
1.8.2. Pro: American military leaders estimated the death toll of a land-based invasion of Japan to be around two million lives total. Thus they saw fit to use the bombs in order to minimize the total damage and expense of life. However, had the U.S. simply blockaded the Japanese mainland using its existing Carrier fleet, the nation would have had to surrender due to lack of coal, oil, and mineral ore, so even the comparatively small death toll of Hiroshima and Nagasaki could have been avoided.
1.8.3. Con: To definitively end a war, it is necessary for both sides to agree to the terms that end the conflict. It was believed at the time that Japan would not accept any terms of surrender without continuing the conflict.
1.8.4. Con: The US public would be angry if there was a way to reduce US casualties that was not implemented.
1.8.5. Pro: Japan had no fuel supply after the fall of Manila. It lost nearly all its airforce in the Philippine Sea & navy at Leyte Gulf.  It was no longer capable of waging war. Russia could have invaded from the west which prompted the US to seek a quick resolution & use the opportunity to test the weapon. Berlin fell without nukes. So could have Tokyo. Maybe less lives were lost or maybe not but that is beside the point. Did the US have to use nuclear weapons? No, there definitely were other options.
1.8.6. Pro: "On this occasion Inoue declared that actual peace terms were unimportant so long as the term "unconditional surrender" was not employed." - [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol9no3/html/v09i3a06p_0001.htm)
1.8.7. Con: Japan's planned [Operation Cherry Blossom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cherry_Blossoms_at_Night) represented a clear threat. Japan was planning on dropping biological weapons of mass destruction upon California, as Japan had done with China. This included plague, anthrax, smallpox, etc. I would call the need to prevent the outbreak of disease as a pressing military need.
1.8.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.2.
1.8.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.8.10. Con: -> See 1.4.10.5.
1.8.11. Con: -> See 1.2.9.6.3.1.1.
1.8.12. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.
1.8.13. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.1.
1.8.14. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.3.
1.8.15. Con: The reason to drop the bombs was more for psychological reasons than military. The goal was to force Japanese leadership to understand that unconditional surrender was the only viable option. The deadly effectiveness of the weapon was designed to accelerate this realization. The decision to surrender earlier had a powerful military impact.
1.8.15.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.4.1.
1.8.15.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.4.
1.8.16. Con: [President Truman stated in private documents that the bombs would be dropped on purely military targets.](http://www.dannen.com/decision/hst-jl25.html)
1.8.17. Con: The war needed to end quickly. The Soviets were invading Japan in the North and the US knew that any land the Soviets took, they would not give back without a fight. Japan, by all rights, may have been an Eastern analogue to Germany during the Cold War.
1.8.17.1. Pro: If the United States waited much longer, the Soviets would have been deeply involved in defeating Japan, increasing their world power, and creating a more threatening enemy to the United States and the free world.
1.9. Con: The targets of the nuclear bombs were selected by a desire to test the technical effects of the nuclear bombs, rather than by military necessity.
1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.4.10.5.7.1.
1.9.2. Pro: Dropping the nuclear bomb on a site that is not a civilian target would have sufficed to induce unconditional surrender.
1.9.2.1. Pro: The bombs may have been justified if the targets had been different. Destroy a military base and you show the Japanese that their army means nothing in the face of your arsenal. However, the Americans choose a civilian target, meaning in the past history took, the bombs were an unnecessary use of force used to force Japan's hand.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: By this logic, the entirely of the bombing campaign against Japan was wrong and should not have occurred. Factories and bases were heavily intertwined into Japanese cities, and the civilians who manned those factories became targets to reduce war production. After firebombing numerous cities, the atomic weapons were simply the next logical step to simply US War Goals.
1.9.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.
1.9.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.10.5.7.
1.9.2.2. Pro: The greater moral issue in this case is of intentionally using nuclear weapons on civilians. The visual target in Hiroshima [was a bridge in the center of the city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aioi_Bridge), many miles from the naval center. The visual target in Nagasaki was the Catholic cathedral in the heart of a vast residential neighborhood far from the naval industries in the port. Both bombs were intentionally dropped on civilians rather than military installations.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: The problem with this claim is that Japanese military, industrial, and civilian facets of life [were heavily mixed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_production_in_Sh%C5%8Dwa_Japan). The Japanese had decentralized their industry to the point that there were mini-factories in houses, and the target base was exceptionally mixed. There was no need to use a nuclear weapon 'just' on a base facility.
1.9.2.2.2. Pro: The intentional killing of nearly 100,000 innocent unarmed civilians should be a war crime.
1.9.2.3. Con: The question is not about where they were used, but whether or not they should have been used at all.
1.9.2.3.1. Con: Where they were used affects the outcome, especially in numbers of civilians killed.
It might be moral to drop a bomb on an enemy military, but not moral to drop it on civilians.
1.9.2.4. Con: Destroying a non-civilian target with a nuclear weapon is a much weaker threat than destroying a population center with hundreds of thousands of people.
1.9.2.5. Con: If bombing Hiroshima was insufficient to induce surrender, it's unlikely bombing a less horrible target would have done so.
1.9.3. Con: Several Manhattan Project [scientists](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=weECGK2rChcC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%E2%80%9CA+great+majority+of+scientists+were+opposed+to+the+sudden+employment+of+the+atom+bomb.%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=dMh5aIOC-7&sig=ZFX4Ezuf6ymnMBszbtoODRyAQDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj855aExqjKAhXoUKYKHSEJD7oQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false) urged Roosevelt not to use the bomb against Japan. It was thus not scientific spirit that drove the US.
1.9.3.1. Con: After a reconsideration of the first Interim Meeting the majority of the Manhattan Project's [scientist](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) agreed that they cannot see an acceptable alternative to direct military use.
1.9.3.2. Pro: A majority of scientists was opposed to using the bomb, as [Albert Einstein](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=weECGK2rChcC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%E2%80%9CA+great+majority+of+scientists+were+opposed+to+the+sudden+employment+of+the+atom+bomb.%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=dMh5aIOC-7&sig=ZFX4Ezuf6ymnMBszbtoODRyAQDg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj855aExqjKAhXoUKYKHSEJD7oQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false) observed.
1.9.3.2.1. Con: But scientists were not the only group that wanted to test the bomb's technical capacities. Military planners were interested in testing its technical effects.
1.9.3.3. Con: The fact that the scientists urged Roosevelt not to carry out the attack does not mean that he was not primarily motivated by a desire to test the effects.
1.9.4. Pro: The bombing of Nagasaki was, at least partially, motivated by the desire to test a plutonium device in order to see which version is better.
1.9.4.1. Pro: It was clear from the [beginning](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/6.pdf) that the plan was to drop both an uranium and a plutonium bomb on Japan.
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.4.11.4.3.1.
1.9.6. Con: The selection committee in May 1945 opted for Hiroshima "to obtain the greatest [psychological](http://www.dannen.com/decision/targets.html) effect" and not because of a desire to test the effects.
1.9.6.1. Con: It is unlikely that the selection committee would have listed "we need a target to test our new bomb" in their official statement.
1.9.6.1.1. Con: The document was Top Secret which makes it possible to discuss everything.
1.9.6.2. Pro: The dropping of leaflets with warnings over Japanese cities [was stopped](http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100928-060.pdf) in order to maximize the surprise effect of the bombs.
1.9.6.3. Pro: Henry L. Stimson, at the time the US Secretary of War, [concluded in 1947](https://inf2149decisionmaking.wikispaces.com/file/view/Stimson+-+Harper+Feb+1947+-+Decision+to+Use+the+Atomic+Bomb.pdf) that "the atomic bomb was more than a weapon of terrible destruction; it was a psychological weapon”.
1.9.7. Pro: The selection of the target was driven by considerations of how [damage](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) was to be produced, i.e. blast, heat or radiation. Thus, first came physical considerations.
1.9.8. Con: Testing effects could have been done anywhere, and tests were conducted in uninhabited areas. Thus, the bombing wasn't solely motivated by a desire to test them.
1.9.8.1. Con: Testing effects in real city on real people would not be done otherwise. Those effect had been not tested. It is not only the explosion that is destructive but also radiation and fallout. They had opportunity to get to know effects of that on people in cities that were attacked.
1.9.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.7.1.
1.9.9. Pro: The bomb should have been dropped off the coast of Japan as a demonstration to Japan of what we could do, not on a city killing innocent people.
1.9.9.1. Con: If the bomb was dropped into the water, it would not have displayed its destructive capability.
1.9.9.1.1. Con: There are plenty of uninhabited or minimally inhabited Islands off of the coast of Japan.  There are also more than a few that were solely used for military purposes.
1.9.9.2. Con: The US only had two bombs, so wasting one into the water would have prevented them from *actually* using one if the threat proved insufficient.
1.9.9.2.1. Con: [The US planned to drop 12 ​Atomic Bombs on Japan.](http://www.thedailybeast.com/us-planned-to-drop-12-atomic-bombs-on-japan)

"Archival records show a third bomb was under assembly at Tinian in the Mariana Islands where the Enola Gay and Bockscar had flown from, with the main plutonium core about to be shipped from the U.S."
1.9.9.3. Con: First and foremost, the Japanese people were willing and able to fight to the death, that is not the mark of the innocent. The idea that their was innocent victims is pure ignorance on the part of those who believe it.
1.10. Pro: Only the use of nuclear weapons gave Japan a legitimate reason to surrender while keeping face. This would not have been the case with conventional bombing.
1.10.1. Con: This implying Japan wanted to be bombed into submission through the destruction of two exclusively civilian centers of population. Any argument or truth in this is proved false by Japan's early overtures to the US to negotiate surrender, through the USSR as a mediator.
1.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.6.
1.10.2. Con: US intelligence reports had information that the Japanese were about 'to crack' and where not very interested in keeping face anymore.
1.10.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.2.
1.10.2.2. Pro: The Office of War Information found by late 1944 that civilian morale was on a path of rapid deterioration \([Dower, p.137](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.10.3. Pro: The bombings suggested that not individual mistakes but the [technological superiority](http://www.mconway.net/page1/page15/files/Shock%20of%20Atomic%20Bomb.pdf) of the US caused the defeat.
1.10.4. Con: The nuclear bombing was unnecessary because it did not alter the Japanese leadership's perception of the threat that America was posing to them.
1.10.4.1. Con: After the Nagasaki bomb the cabinet was deadlocked evenly and it took, for the first time in Japanese history, the Emperor to cast a vote to break the tie and surrender \(see [American Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Caesar)\).
1.10.4.2. Pro: Because conventional bombings were more destructive, the use of nuclear bombs did not represent a higher level of threat towards Japan.
1.10.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.4.
1.10.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.3.
1.10.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.5.
1.10.4.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.1.1.
1.10.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.3.4.1.2.
1.10.4.4. Pro: Japanese leaders were used to [messages](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/) of major destruction in the weeks before the nuclear attacks.
1.10.4.4.1. Con: These messages only told Japanese leaders that the US was willing to claim to have a particularly destructive weapon, not that they actually did, or were willing or capable of using it.
1.10.4.4.1.1. Con: Japanese [intelligence](http://www.nisa-intelligence.nl/PDF-bestanden/NISAcongresFord.pdf) was notoriously bad leading to severe uncertainties in future predictions. Relying on past experiences of US bombing thus made the best predictor.
1.10.4.5. Con: The bombing of Nagasaki was effective in changing Emperor Hirohito's mind and making him accept an unconditional surrender.
1.10.4.5.1. Pro: When announcing surrender Emperor Hirohito explicitly [mentioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewel_Voice_Broadcast) the nuclear bomb.
1.10.4.5.1.1. Con: In the rescript of Hirohito's surrender broadcast he [emphasized](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) the Russian attack as reason without mentioning the atomic bomb.
1.10.4.5.1.1.1. Pro: Russia was poised to invade Japan. Japan did not have the power to withstand the force of Russia, USA, Europe and European colonial empires.
1.10.4.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The Japanese beat the Russians in the [1905 Russio-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War).
1.10.4.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The Japanese did not achieve a total victory but had to settle with a negotiated agreement.
1.10.4.5.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.10.4.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.5.
1.10.4.5.1.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.1.
1.10.4.5.1.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.4.3.2.
1.10.4.5.1.1.1.6. Con: -> See 1.2.4.3.3.
1.10.4.5.1.1.2. Con: The Japanese Emperor's pride to save face to his people without undermining his rule is perhaps one reason why he failed to emphasize the superior power of America in his surrender speech.  What mattered to America was that the war ended, not that the Japanese people were given an honest explanation by their leaders.
1.10.4.5.1.1.2.1. Con: It is unclear why the Hirohito would choose to emphasise the superior power of the USSR rather than that of the USA instead.
1.10.4.5.1.1.2.2. Pro: One reason why Hirohito might have emphasized the power of the USSR instead of the USA includes that the people were already accustomed to hearing the "power of the USA"; this change in the environment might have shocked people into rethinking their course of action
1.10.4.5.1.1.2.3. Pro: Another reason for his doing this could be that this would cast the USA as a "sober, paternal protector" from the "evil, looming USSR," rather than villainize the country's soon-to-be occupiers
1.10.4.5.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.12.
1.10.4.5.2. Pro: Because the Supreme War Council was split, the opinion of the [Emperor](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ptgudYEFOM0C&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=Japan%27s+Delayed+Surrender:+A+Reinterpretation&source=bl&ots=H1WOeYVHZz&sig=aywixtBLFIk71ouNj6YYdukQ_n4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSyu3UyqPKAhWDHZQKHfkIC8IQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) was crucial to accepting an unconditional surrender on August 14th.
1.10.4.5.3. Pro: The Emperor noted on August 8 that "now that such a new weapon has appeared, it has become less and less [possible](http://www.mconway.net/page1/page15/files/Shock%20of%20Atomic%20Bomb.pdf) to continue the war".
1.10.4.5.4. Pro: In the crucial meeting [Hirohito](http://www.mconway.net/page1/page15/files/Shock%20of%20Atomic%20Bomb.pdf) opted for surrender arguing that "\[e\]specially since the appearance of the atomic bomb" there was no more hope.
1.10.4.5.5. Con: Emperor Hirohito changed his mind already [before](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&pg=PR1&lpg=PR1&dq=paine+wars+for+asia&source=bl&ots=amDgU-_zKf&sig=2E9deqKx7EilExkVfZu1fDpuD-0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiykMnm0JnKAhUIlKYKHeshBfcQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false) the bombing but failed to make Japan surrender.
1.10.4.5.5.1. Con: Hirohito aimed at a negotiated agreement and did not accept unconditional surrender even [after](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ptgudYEFOM0C&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=Japan%27s+Delayed+Surrender:+A+Reinterpretation&source=bl&ots=H1WOeYVHZz&sig=aywixtBLFIk71ouNj6YYdukQ_n4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSyu3UyqPKAhWDHZQKHfkIC8IQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q&f=false) the drop on Hiroshima.
1.10.4.6. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.4.1.1.1.
1.10.4.7. Con: -> See 1.4.5.
1.10.4.8. Con: The dropping of the nuclear bomb did [convince](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/55a.pdf) the military that defeat was certain.
1.10.4.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.
1.10.4.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.10.4.9. Con: -> See 1.4.5.4.
1.10.4.10. Pro: The leaders of the axis had declared this a total war. This meant that the possibility that one side or the other would use weapons of total destruction had to be taken into consideration - including a nuclear option." Thus, it could not have been considered a "surprise" forcing a country to suddenly surrender.
1.10.4.10.1. Con: Even if theoretically 'priced in' the actual use of weapons and their realization can alter perceptions
1.10.4.10.2. Pro: If Japan got caught by surprise with the atomic bombs and surrendered because of that, it was not the bomb itself, but bad planning by its leaders.
1.10.4.10.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.2.
1.10.4.10.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.3.5.
1.10.4.10.2.3. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.4.1.4.
1.10.4.10.3. Con: Atomic bombs are up until today the most devastating weapons mankind developed. Using them in a scale like the US did in Japan was unforeseeable and saying that the Japanese leaders had to "price in" this option is cynical.
1.10.4.10.3.1. Con: Military technology \(especially through arial and fire bombings\) had already reached an unprecedented level in WWII. So, in fact, there was nothing that could not be expected anymore; also not an atomic strike.
1.10.4.10.3.2. Con: It is not cynical, but necessary to calculate that way, not the least because if Japan had wanted to prevent such events they should not have waged war and enter the Axis Powers out of nationalist, expansional reasons.
1.10.4.10.3.3. Con: -> See 1.4.7.3.
1.10.4.10.4. Con: Not when taking into consideration that the US fought against Germany because of moral reasons. They fought against the Nazi regime, which gave them automatically the moral high ground. Dropping the atomic bomb made them immoral as well, which should have been avoided and did not stand up to their moral duty.
1.10.4.11. Con: -> See 1.2.12.
1.10.5. Pro: Dropping the atomic bombs helped to [mitigate](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/) Japan's global image as aggressors and to draw a more sympathetic picture of it in the world.
1.10.5.1. Pro: Japan immediately [complained](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/02/05/voices/u-s-and-japanese-apologies-for-war-crimes-could-pave-way-for-nuclear-disarmament/) about the use of the nuclear bomb as a "new crime against human culture".
1.10.5.2. Pro: Japan was able to stylize itself as the victim and appeal to the world's consciousness.
1.10.5.2.1. Pro: It was from Hiroshima that the first [World Conference](http://atomicbombmuseum.org/5_beginnings.shtml) Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs started.
1.10.5.2.2. Pro: It was from Hiroshima that a white paper on A-bomb victims for presentations to the [United Nations](http://atomicbombmuseum.org/5_perspectives.shtml) was drafted for the UN in 1968.
1.10.5.3. Con: It was not before 1981 that the first truly comprehensive [English](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki.html?id=uhhtAAAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y) report about the physical, medical, and social effects of the atomic bombings reached a wider audience.
1.10.5.4. Pro: As of 1991 there were over 20.000 individual survivors [testimonies](http://atomicbombmuseum.org/5_perspectives.shtml) written that brought the consequences of nuclear destruction to a world audience.
1.10.5.5. Pro: Hiroshima slowly became the default [comparison](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/hiroshima-usa-169079615/?no-ist) for what could happen if an atomic bomb is dropped on another city.
1.10.5.5.1. Pro: Even today explosive capability of nuclear weapons is referred to as a multiplication of the explosive of the Hiroshima bomb.
1.10.6. Con: -> See 1.10.4.5.1.1.
1.10.7. Pro: A widespread belief among US military command was that only by inflicting a crushing [defeat](http://www.amazon.com/Embracing-Defeat-Japan-Wake-World/dp/0393320278) could the Japanese accept the surrender in honor.
1.10.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.4.
1.10.9. Pro: The Japanese forced the US into a war with them the US didnt want. The US were the victims in the assault. The US had \(as all nations have\) every sovereign right and duty to its people to end any war they are forced into by their enemy, by any means they deem fit.  Perpetrators of war do not have the moral high-ground.
1.10.9.1. Con: The US didn't want that war. And the Japanese didn't want two of their cities full of civilians to be devastated by atomic bombs either. Two wrongs do not make a right.
1.10.9.2. Con: We do not have the right to end any war by any means we deem fit under [the Geneva Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions).
1.10.10. Con: The use of nuclear weapons in Japan opened a Pandora's box, inviting the use of much more deadly nuclear weapons \(including non-explosive weapons\) later. For example, the use of radioactive nuclear waste in Fallujah has resulted birth defects fourteen times that in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[\[U.S. Use of Uranium Weaponry\]](https://medium.com/\@pagenotes/uranium-weaponry-in-syria-2bf5391ca29d)
1.10.11. Pro: The reality of a nuclear world was inevitable. The horrors this reality of such needed to be displayed in order to prove their deterrent effect.
1.10.12. Pro: Japanese culture would not allow even the discussion of surrender while conventional bombs were being used. If one were to argue the point of how inhuman the atomic bombs were, one needs to consider the fact that the majority of Japanese deaths were civilians who died in the firebombing of major Japanese cities. Though the atomic bombs caused deaths after the fact through radiation sickness, the majority of deaths were instantaneous.
1.10.12.1. Con: The killing of civilians, including innocent women, children, men, etc that had nothing to do with the war effort is likely the greatest terrorism act ever perpetuated in the history of mankind.
1.10.12.2. Pro: The Japanese wouldn't have surrendered without an extreme tactic: their soldiers were so loyal to the emperor and their empire that some soldiers stayed in some of the Pacific islands for over thirty years after WW2 ended. "When the US troops entered Saipan, they witnessed a different atrocity as they saw women grabbing kids and jumping from cliffs rather than submitting to capture by the American troops[atomicheritage.org](https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/japanese-mass-suicides)"
1.10.12.3. Pro: After the war, war time Prime Minister [Suzuki](http://www.mconway.net/page1/page15/files/Shock%20of%20Atomic%20Bomb.pdf) acknowledged that "the atomic bomb provided an additional reason for surrender as well as an extremely favorable opportunity to commence peace talks. I believed such an opportunity could not be afforded by B-29 bombings alone."
1.10.12.4. Pro: Dwight Eisenhower's memoir discusses a [military briefing](http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_weber.html) from mid-July. According to Eisenhower, "It was my belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of 'face'."
1.10.12.5. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.5.1.
1.11. Con: -> See 1.2.9.
1.12. Con: The bomb\(s\) were also dropped, in part, [out of racial prejudices](https://michiganjournalhistory.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/oh_jung.pdf) against the Japanese people, which had escalated in American society following the attack of Pearl Harbor.
1.12.1. Con: The Americans fire bombed Dresden and Hamburg. Thus there is no reason to believe that without prejudice, the bombing would not have occurred.
1.12.2. Con: The Americans shared little to no such military-racial biases towards the Chinese with which they cooperated, suggesting that the relation to Japan had more to do with the Japan culture, perceived as inhumane, than with race. These two shouldn't be mixed.
1.12.3. Con: Timing, not race, determined that nukes were used against Japan. Nuclear weapons were used against the Japanese because they were still fighting and were the only enemy still in the war. Had the US developed nuclear weapons a year earlier, they would certainly have been used against the Germans. Since Germans and Americans are the same race, racism cannot be claimed.
1.12.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.1.
1.12.4. Pro: The US showed clear signs of degrading treatment towards Japanese, indicating racial discrimination.
1.12.4.1. Pro: The incarceration of 120.000 Japanese-Americans indicates that high numbers of victims were [no threshold](http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/japanese_internment/documents/index.php?pagenumber=4&documentid=62&documentdate=1946-00-00&collectionid=JI&nav=ok).
1.12.4.2. Pro: The [mutilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_mutilation_of_Japanese_war_dead) of Japanese POWs showed that human degrading treatment was not an obstacle.
1.12.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.12.4.4. Pro: The [Life](http://time.com/3880997/young-woman-with-jap-skull-portrait-of-a-grisly-wwii-memento/) magazine featured the representation of a Japanese skull as something regular.
1.12.4.5. Pro: US president [Harry Truman](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/633) justified the dropping of the bomb on racial grounds that the Japanese have to be treated like a beast.
1.12.5. Pro: There was the fear of a race war if the 'white race' wouldn't eliminate usurpers of the 'colored race' both domestically against the African American population and internationally against the colonized \([Dower, pp. 147-180](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.12.6. Pro: The Japanese were conceived very negatively in the US because of atrocities committed  during the war.
1.12.6.1. Pro: Japanese were seen as cruel and thus [deserving](http://www.amazon.com/Prompt-Utter-Destruction-Truman-against/dp/1442994754) annihilation.
1.12.6.2. Pro: The Japanese air force developed and deployed a Kamikaze program towards the end of the war, sending thousands of pilots to their certain death.
1.12.6.3. Pro: Japanese [execution](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0LHJI0lsODcC&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) of own wounded soldiers at a Japanese hospital in China indicated the willingness to commit crimes against the own population.
1.12.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.1.1.2.2.
1.12.7. Pro: In US [war propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Japanese_sentiment_in_the_United_States#World_War_II) the Japanese were displayed as rats or snakes indicating that killing them was equivalent to pest control. This dehumanization facilitated the indiscriminate killing.
1.12.7.1. Pro: General Blamey in 1942 described the Japanese as 'subhuman beasts' and must be killed unless they kill Americans \([Dower, p.53](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.12.7.2. Pro: Most notoriously the Japanese were displayed as apes. This simian image illustrate their lesser value which can be killed without the same restrain.
1.12.7.2.1. Con: Military leaders, such as Admiral Halsey, had been motivated in part by a conscious concern to discredit "the new myth of Japanese invincibility" \([Dower, p. 116](https://books.google.de/books/about/War_Without_Mercy.html?id=8himI4wNnxEC&redir_esc=y)\).
1.12.8. Pro: A 1944 [opinion poll](http://as.ucpress.edu/content/ucpfes/19/10/101) found that 13% of the U.S. public were in favor of the extermination of all Japanese. This indicates the strong racial prejudice.
1.12.8.1. Con: 13% of any population suggests a fringe prejudice only. This was a minority group, present in some form in any population.
1.12.9. Con: Truman showed signs of restraint to spare women, children and the old and new capital despite racial prejudices in his [diary](http://www.dannen.com/decision/hst-jl25.html).
1.12.10. Con: The war with Japan started, in part, due to Japanese racial prejudices against the West, which is why Imperialist Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in the first place. Thus, both sides are equally guilty/innocent of race-based military posturing.
1.12.10.1. Con: Even if we stipulate that both sides based their military posturing on race, there is no zero sum game for right and wrong.
1.12.10.2. Con: This is a clear [False Equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence). Attacking the military base at Pearl Harbor and dropping nuclear bombs on the civilian populated cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are very different things.
