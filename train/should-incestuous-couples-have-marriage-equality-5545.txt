Discussion Title: Should Incestuous Couples Have Marriage Equality?

1. Incestual parties who who cannot have children should have marriage equality.
1.1. Pro: Incestual couples are brought out of illegality if their relationships are sanctioned.
1.1.1. Con: Incestuous relationships should not be sanctioned because they are morally wrong.
1.1.1.1. Con: Gay and lesbian marriage is no longer considered immoral by many people, and interracial marriage used to be considered immoral also. Morality is always changing, so it might be possible for it to change for incestuous relationships.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: It might also be possible for it to change in regards to murder, rape, cannibalism, or pedophilia. That doesn't mean we should accept it now.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There are far fewer reasons for denying these incestual parties than reasons for denying rape or paedophilia.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Both adults would be consenting in incestuous relationships. Those who experience rape and pedophilia are either not of legal age to consent, or forced into it.
1.1.1.2. Con: What is [morally acceptable](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/15/whats-morally-acceptable-it-depends-on-where-in-the-world-you-live/) is often dependent on where one lives in the world. It is likely that incestuous relationships are not considered morally wrong in absolute terms.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The fact that incest laws vary [state-by-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_regarding_incest_in_the_United_States) and [country-by-country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_regarding_incest) is proof of this.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: [Moral absolutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism) are very debatable, and many consider them to simply not exist.
1.1.1.3. Pro: The personal business of consenting adults is not society's business to decide.
1.1.2. Pro: Their children are also not so stigmatised, if the relationships are sanctioned.
1.1.2.1. Con: This will take a long time to manifest, given how strong the current social objections to incest are.
1.2. Con: Incest should not be allowed, regardless of the infertility of the relationship, because it perverts the relationship between family members.
1.2.1. Con: 'Perversion' is just a name for something someone does not like, and holds no true value, definition, or weight. As made obvious by the legal standard of "I'll know it when I see it."
1.2.1.1. Pro: Subjective definitions like this are, by their nature, transient.
1.2.2. Pro: Relationships between a parent and their child would destroy the father/mother figure and role of the parent making the child psychologically an orphan.
1.2.3. Pro: Relationships between two family members would create an atmosphere of jealousy for affection and authority within the family.
1.2.3.1. Con: This is not a problem of incest, but of jealousy and emotional immaturity.
1.2.4. Pro: An incestual marriage could turn into a legal method for someone to deceive a family member and plot to take his/her heir.
1.2.5. Con: It should not be for society to choose what type of relationship is best for two individuals. If two individuals consent to an incestuous relationship, than they may have some reason to believe that they gain more out of that relationship than they would otherwise gain from a familial relationship.
1.2.6. Con: Incestual relationships can be strong, healthy, caring relationships, just like any other. These otherwise normal, caring, healthy families exist, as products of incestuous relationships. The primary downside in these relationships, is having to face the bigoted remarks of people opposed to such relationships. Laws regarding incestuous marriages varies widely between states, and marriage between first cousins is [allowed in approximately 20 States](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage_law_in_the_United_States_by_state).
1.2.7. Con: Because of the [Westermarck Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westermarck_effect) predisposing children to not form romantic connections to family members, a large percentage of consensual incest is due to genetic sexual attraction \([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_sexual_attraction)\) between related individuals who were raised without close proximity during childhood or having a social family relationship due for example to one partner being adopted separately, born to a different mother, conceived via sperm/egg donorship, or similar situations.
1.3. Con: Incestual relationships promote elitism and classism/racism/tribalism in society by allowing families to isolate their own limited worldviews and their family properties from other families; married infertile and incestual partners could adopt kids and raise them under that same sectarian "clan" view.
1.3.1. Con: The elitism, classism and racism spoken of here could only occur if it were possible for the incestual relationship to procreate. If everyone in an infertile, gay, or lesbian family were to become incestual, that bloodline would quickly die out.
1.3.2. Pro: Wealthy families could hoard their wealth by not allowing anyone without their lastname to take a hold on it,[just like the Rothchilds' did](http://www.anonews.co/dark-secrets-from-the-wealthiest-family/).
1.3.2.1. Con: Adoption would not always be incestuous.
1.3.2.2. Con: Hoarding of wealth along family lines "to anyone with the family name" is already promoted in patriarchal contemporary inheritance traditions by granting inheritance to sons and their non-related wives \(who take their name\). It doesn't require incest to function and so is irrelevant.
1.3.3. Con: Married couples who are not incestuous can also promote classism/racism/tribalism/elitism in this way as well. Restricting incestuous marriage is thus not a solution.
1.4. Pro: Anyone who is monogamous and wants the benefits of a marriage partner should be given those benefits if it does not threaten the life of others.
1.4.1. Con: Monogamy is not required, as long as the people are comfortable in the arrangement that they have.
1.4.2. Con: Marriage is not a right if it undermines the social or moral fabric of a society, and such things need to be considered on their merits. Simply not endangering lives is not sufficient justification if there are other major problems to be considered.
1.5. Con: Although more a problem with parental relationships, it is quite possible that the same power dynamics that we use as a basis for disallowing relationships between many professionals and their clientele could exist in these situation, creating a relation where one person has all the power.
1.5.1. Con: Historically, people who were raised together, and thus have these same power dynamics, have gotten married, or even been betrothed to one another.
1.5.1.1. Pro: This can be seen with Elizabeth, Frankenstein's adopted sister in [Mary Shelly's Frankenstein](https://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/frankenstein/Chars/eliz).
1.5.2. Pro: Older siblings, or incestuous relationships between a parent and child, may result in a power struggle.
1.6. Con: If fertility tests were misdiagnosed, a pregnancy may happen, resulting in an inbred child.
1.6.1. Pro: The closer the genetic spectrum of two mating individuals, [the easier it is for them to generate offspring with equally mutated or sick alleles](https://www.google.com.co/amp/s/m.ranker.com/amp/list/genetic-mutation-from-incest/laura-allan) which would activate mutations and diseases that were previously silent and bring about weaker immune systems \([if the incest is between 1st line relatives the chance of mental disability and severe birth defects is 50%](https://www.google.com.co/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201210/the-problem-incest%3famp)\); which would be disastrous for the children, the parents and the costs in health care.
1.6.1.1. Con: Humans could adapt to these conditions. There are [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3433984/) that indicate inbreeding can purge genetic load by “exposing” deleterious recessive expressed alleles to selective pressures.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: The price of that purge would be the suffering of those born with the mutations and vulnerabilities \(higher mortality rates and mental disability\).
1.6.1.2. Pro: Studies suggest that [20-36%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest#cite_note-WolfDurham2005-9) of parent-child or sibling-sibling children will die or have major disability due to the inbreeding.
1.6.1.3. Pro: A study of 29 offspring resulting from brother-sister or father-daughter incest [found that 20 had congenital abnormalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest#cite_note-Baird-128), including four directly attributable to autosomal recessive alleles.
1.6.1.4. Con: A 1994 study found the mean excess mortality with inbreeding among first cousins is only [4.4%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest#cite_note-127), because [cousins share only 12.5% of their DNA](https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212170668-Average-percent-DNA-shared-between-relatives).
1.6.1.5. Con: It is not illegal for people with mental disabilities like Down syndrome to have children, even though their offspring will likely have the disease too.
1.6.2. Con: This is assuming that people will stop having sex just because they can't get married, which thousands of years of LGBTQ+ history has shown to be false.
1.6.3. Con: If such event occurs, the parents have the option to abort the pregnancy.
1.6.3.1. Con: [It's almost impossible to diagnose all mutations or sickness during the pregnancy](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/genetics/services/), you can at most diagnose major heart malformations and growth issues through ultrasound, more expensive tests would be mandatory for an incestuous pregnancy which not all parents can afford, and even those tests can't discard all problems.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: If they have the money for the tests that would be necessary to ensure the risk was suitably minimal, they would probably have the money for fertility tests.
1.6.3.2. Pro: For the marriage to occur, abortion could be required in the case of an accidental pregnancy.
1.6.4. Con: This is assuming that the couple is opposite sex/heterosexual.
1.6.5. Con: This is assuming that the couple is fertile despite the question clearly indicating that they are not.
1.7. Pro: Incest has been a practice throughout history all over the world. Granting marriage equality will help recognize it, making it more acceptable.
1.7.1. Con: This is not necessarily a good thing in many people's opinions.
1.8. Pro: It is important to strive for equality. Marriage rights are an equality issue. The more we question who has the right to marry, the more we question and address equality issues.
1.8.1. Con: There are other important factors in considering who should and should not be granted access to marriage, such as the consensual nature and potential challenges of the union.
1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.
1.8.1.2. Con: This is not consistently applied now. Age disparate relationships are allowed, as are marriages between unemployed and employed people, educated and uneducated, poor and rich people, strong able-bodied people and dependent disabled people, and many other power-unequal pairings.  Additionally, legal marriage might create a more level playing field compared to non-legal cohabitation, in which there are no legal protections of joint property, etc.
1.8.2. Pro: [Article 16](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that 'men and women of full age, and without limitation due to race, nationality, or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family.'
1.8.3. Con: Most administrative marriage benefits would already be enjoyed by an incestual couple \(through other means, by virtue of being related\).
1.8.4. Pro: Previously held beliefs - in particularly regarding sexuality and gender - have been overturned in recent years. Marriage equality for incestuous couples would be a reasonable next step.
1.9. Pro: The only factually grounded objection to incestuous relation is the dangers of inbreeding and since possible reproduction is de facto excluded from the thesis, all objections to the thesis are subjective.
