Discussion Title: Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?

1. The United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union.
1.1. Pro: Membership of the EU ensures freedom of movement between all the member states.
1.1.1. Con: Leaving the EU allows Britain to be able to control the flow of immigration to its shores.
1.1.1.1. Con: Data collected and summarised by the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/migration/OECD%20Migration%20Policy%20Debates%20Numero%202.pdf) suggests that immigration is in most cases positive for the economy. Restricting immigration is equivalent to restricting economic benefit.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: The choice of the English people makes it clear that for them, the economic benefits of immigration do not outweigh the threat they pose to national identity and culture.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The choice of the English people is against the choice of the people of [Scotland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36599102) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-36614443).
1.1.1.2. Con: You can't blame UK's failure to trace and control migration on the EU. 
[eur-lex.europa.eu](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:en:PDF)
1.1.1.3. Pro: It is harder for someone from outside the EU to migrate to the UK. It would be fairer if migrants from all countries had to go through the same immigration process.
1.1.1.4. Con: Most immigration doesn't arrive at the shores but [from the sky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom).
1.1.2. Pro: By closing the borders we are also restricting British youth's opportunities of working and studying abroad, therefore, reducing the capacity for innovation and ultimately reducing the country's competitiveness.
1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3. Pro: Leaving the EU could threaten relations between UK countries.
1.3.1. Pro: If the UK leaves the EU then a border with Ireland would be reintroduced.
1.3.1.1. Con: A border with Ireland is not a prerequisite for departure from the EU. Brexit does not guarantee that a hard border will be restored.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: As long as the UK leaves the single market and abandons free movement, which the [UK government](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/02/theresa-may-says-brexit-will-reduce-uk-access-to-single-market) has stated it intends on doing, then a hard border will be required.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Assuming “a need” for a hard border - no one would dare construct it or police it.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: No one other than UK PM or Taoiseach has authority to make such decisions, and neither May nor Varadkaw would be keen to do it as this would entail political suicide.
1.3.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The EU \(as an institution\) does not have the power or prerogative to construct border infrastructure or police the borders of its member states.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: If there is no border with a hard brexit, then there is de facto free movement of people in Ireland between the EU and the UK. This result in not achieving the "control our border" brexit objective.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: If NI and the UK had different customs terms but no hard border separating them, it would immediately become a trivial smuggling route for anyone seeking to evade either set of terms.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: The border with Ireland did not come about because of the EU.
1.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: The [Common Travel Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Travel_Area) began in 1923, the year after the Republic of Ireland seceded from the UK. The EU didn't start to come together [until 1951](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union).
1.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: After the Irish Civil War, the CTA Agreement was complemented by the [1952 Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Travel_Area), when all immigration controls were removed, removing the border. But Ireland didn't join the EU [until 1973](http://www.askaboutireland.ie/learning-zone/primary-students/subjects/history/history-the-full-story/ireland-in-modern-times/joining-the-eu/).
1.3.1.1.4. Pro: Both the EU and UK have explained their willingness to make a deal and avoid a hard border.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The softening of the UK-Ireland border has been a major achievement, and major underpinning, of the Good Friday Agreement process which has brought and consolidated peace in Northern Ireland. Any change to the status of the border is likely to have an impact on the peace process.
1.3.1.3. Con: It may be that the reintroduction of a border in order to deliver Brexit is, on balance, preferred because of the relative gain from regaining control of our borders even when set against the potential consequences on the UK-Ireland settlement.
1.3.2. Pro: Leaving the EU increases the chances of a positive vote on Scottish independence, thus destroying the UK itself.
1.4. Con: With the biggest opponent of further integration gone, the EU would have a much easier way to bring its member states together under the same umbrella.
1.5. Pro: Its is the only way to weight significantly on the international scene and be able to negotiate on equal terms with today's major powers.
1.5.1. Pro: The UK is not a major power anymore. It's GDP\(nominal\) is less than [a seventh of the US's GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29) \(nominal\) and almost [a fifth china's GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29)\(nominal\).
1.6. Pro: There are good reasons to believe that the Brexit vote was manipulated by Russian influences. It shouldn't be the foundation for England leaving the EU.
1.6.1. Pro: Manipulating the Brexit vote would have served the Russian goal of separating the UK from Europe, as it was outlined by Alexander Dugin in his book [Foundations of Geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics).
1.6.2. Pro: You can read about the interference [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_Brexit_referendum) and [here](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/heres-what-we-know-about-alleged-russian-involvement-in-brexit).
1.7. Pro: Other EU states want the UK to stay.
1.7.1. Pro: Angela Merkel said she would [like the UK to stay](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/02/angela-merkel-britain-remain-eu-european-union).
1.8. Con: Leaving the EU is the will of the people.
1.8.1. Con: [Polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum#Post–referendum_polling) now suggests public opinion has changed.
1.8.1.1. Con: Polls have been consistently incorrect for a number of years and have lost credibility [www.bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40123231)
1.8.1.2. Pro: The will of the people fluctuates, sometimes they rather leave and sometimes they rather stay. Future generations did not have a vote.
1.8.1.3. Con: Upon closer inspection of [post-referendum polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum#Post%E2%80%93referendum_polling), the lead fluctuates a lot and mostly hovers between a 1 and 5% lead for wrong or pro-remain. [Pre-referendum polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum#2016) had similar pro-remain margins which suggests that poll audiences are on average slightly skewed in favour of remain when compared with real votes.
1.8.2. Con: [54%](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/20/european-neighbours-want-britain-to-remain-but-only-just) of citizens in 28 member states would like the UK to remain in the EU.
1.8.2.1. Con: There is limited basis for national decision making based on popular opinion polls in other countries.
1.8.3. Con: The people are not well informed enough to make such a decision - this choice should be left up to elected officials.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Their [majority view](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35616946) over a long period of time has been that membership of the EU is in our interests.
1.8.3.2. Pro: The role of our elected MPs is to think and act carefully in choosing the best course for the country.
1.8.3.3. Pro: Enacting a simple majority vote of the people who disagree with Parliament on this issue weakens Parliament.
1.8.3.4. Pro: The UK is a parliamentary democracy, not a direct one. The people elect representatives to carry on the business of government on their behalf.
1.8.3.5. Con: It's implicit in a referendum that voters will be less informed than experts. This does not delegitamise the result.
1.8.3.5.1. Con: It is to be expected that voters will generally not be experts on complex political issues, but the 2016 referendum packaged up a huge bundle of such issues and required a blunt yes/no answer to the question of EU membership. There is nothing wrong with non-experts having the vote, but the referendum campaigns were actively misleading and made claims that were known to be false at the time they were made. This is a deeper failing than lack of expertise.
1.8.4. Con: The party that ran on the basis of granting the EU Referendum lost its majority in the following general election.
1.8.4.1. Con: The loss of a parliamentary majority in an election must be attributable to the whole of the party manifesto, not just to the former stance on an event that has already happened.
1.8.4.2. Pro: The Conservative election campaign made great play of positioning Theresa May as the best leader to deliver Brexit and was clear that the party supported Brexit, so the result can legitimately be seen as significantly, if not wholly, expressive of the electorate's view of Brexit.
1.8.5. Pro: The victory of the Leave side on the terms set out in the referendum legislation is not in doubt; there are no suspicions about vote rigging or any other activity which would render the result illegitimate.
1.8.5.1. Con: Since the referendum revelations have emerged around [the role of Cambridge Analytica and the influence of Facebook](https://metro.co.uk/2018/03/22/eu-referendum-result-may-not-legitimate-due-facebook-scandal-warns-mep-7407581/) in the vote, which puts the result in doubt.
1.8.5.2. Con: The Electoral Commission has confirmed that the Leave campaign\(s\) [broke spending rules](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44856992).
1.8.5.3. Con: The potential involvement of [foreign agents](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy), such as Russia and certain alt-right groups, puts the result in doubt.
1.8.5.4. Con: Victory for the Leave campaign was only achieved because of misleading statements and undeliverable promises that were disingenuous.
1.8.5.4.1. Pro: For instance, the leave campaign argued that "[Turkey](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-vince-cable-vote-leave-turks-live-village-80-million-liberal-democrat-leader-church-halls-a7835891.html) is imminently joining the EU", leading to further immigration into Britain, which was an unfounded claim.
1.8.5.4.2. Pro: For instance, the campaign claimed that "£350m/week would be saved through Brexit, which could be funnelled to the NHS. The Leave campaign only [admitted that this was false](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/18/boris-johnson-350-million-claim-bogus-foreign-secretary), once the vote had been won.
1.8.5.4.3. Pro: Leave campaigners advocated  [membership of the Single Market,](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/open-britain-video-single-market-nigel-farage-anna-soubry_uk_582ce0a0e4b09025ba310fce) as part of the Brexit deal, which is now clearly in question.
1.8.5.4.4. Con: The Remain campaign also made claims that turned out to be untrue or undeliverable.
1.8.5.4.4.1. Pro: For instance, George Osborne insisted that there would be an "[emergency budget](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/14/osborne-predicts-30bn-hole-in-public-finance-if-uk-votes-to-leave-eu)" if Leave won, which was never fulfilled.
1.8.5.4.4.2. Con: This is true, but the fact that both sides campaigns were full of lies and misinformation renders the overall result meaningless especially when the vote was so close. The number of people voting differently due to misinformation likely far exceeded margin of votes between leave and remain. So it is unclear as to what the majority of the electorate really wants.
1.8.5.4.4.3. Pro: David Cameron admitted that the Remain campaign's catastrophising claims turned out to be [unfounded.](http://Brexit vote has turned out less badly than we thought)
1.8.6. Pro: The referendum was the largest single exercise in democracy that modern British politics has ever witnessed, delivering the biggest popular vote on one side in British history.
1.8.6.1. Pro: Nearly [three quarters](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2016/06/24/how-did-turnout-affect-the-eu-referendum-result/) of the electorate cast their vote, and 17.4 million people voted in favour of leaving the EU.
1.8.6.2. Con: There is no significance behind the relative size of this vote in relation to others, as it is comparing different kinds of election.
1.8.6.2.1. Pro: Unlike at a general election there were only two choices, which may have affected voter turnout.
1.8.7. Con: -> See 1.8.5.4.
1.8.8. Con: A [4% margin](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-final-result-leave-campaign-secures-official-lead-a7099296.html) should not be viewed as a sufficient mandate to fundamentally alter the United Kingdom's relationship with its closest neighbours.
1.8.8.1. Pro: It was a mistake to have a massive change mandated by mere majority. The vote to leave should have needed a clear majority like %75, for example.
1.8.8.2. Con: The results of previous UK referenda on constitutional issues with smaller margins of victory have been accepted.
1.8.8.2.1. Pro: For example, the result of the [Welsh Devolution Referendum 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_devolution_referendum,_1997) was accepted with 50.3% of votes supporting the Government's proposal.
1.8.8.2.1.1. Pro: As 51.9% of votes supporting the proposal to leave the EU exceeds this benchmark, there is sufficient mandate for British Exit from the EU based on past precedent.
1.8.8.3. Pro: [More than a quarter](http://ukandeu.ac.uk/what-if-everyone-had-voted-in-the-eu-referendum/) of the electorate didn't vote.
1.8.9. Pro: Ignoring the referendum reduces the democratic legitimacy of the UK political process.
1.8.9.1. Con: -> See 1.8.3.4.
1.8.9.2. Con: The referendum's legal status was only meant to be advisory.
1.8.9.2.1. Pro: The Conservative government's claim to enact any majority decision was just that, a political claim, and not legally binding.
1.8.9.2.2. Con: The fact the parliament passed the article 50 bill thus mandates the decision.
1.8.9.3. Pro: If the referendum is ignored the will of the people is thwarted.
1.8.9.4. Con: There is no suggestion that the referendum should be ignored: it needs to be given full and proper consideration. That doesn't necessarily mean leaving the EU, though.
1.8.9.4.1. Pro: Representatives should be advised \(but not driven\) by the result of the referendum, there are many other matters they must also consider.
1.8.10. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.9. Con: The EU is increasingly seeking to centralise power, which means the UK has less control over its own laws and practices.
1.9.1. Con: Most large countries in the EU pass sovereign powers upwards and downwards.
1.9.1.1. Pro: The UK devolves powers to local authorities, the 4 nations, and upwards to the EU, NATO, Commonwealth and WTO/WHO/UN.
1.9.2. Pro: Globally, the popular tendency is towards the distribution of power as thinly and widely as possible, which suggests that is what societies want right now.
1.9.2.1. Pro: The rise of bitcoin, social media and localisation/anti-globalisation are all examples of this trend.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: Internet based technologies are not an argument against centralisation. Regardless of how sites appear to be structured, the existence of the consumer internet depends on communications architecture which is heavy centralized and government monitored.
1.9.2.1.2. Con: Bitcoin, social media and localisation/anti-globalisation are different phenomena in substance from the European Union and the organisation of political power among governments. Indeed they could all coexist with a centralised EU - there is nothing intrinsic in those trends that has clear lessons for the future of the EU.
1.9.3. Pro: The EU is making laws uniform for over 300 million disparate people, which is likely to be ineffective as these people lead such different realities in such different contexts.
1.9.3.1. Con: The US has federal laws that cover more than 300 million people.
1.9.3.2. Con: The EU is not a federal union. Drafting of legislation is never done without the full participation of directly elected Members of the European Parliament \(who represent the diversity of local realities in Europe\) and/or the national governments making decisions themselves.
1.9.3.3. Con: Transposition of EU law into national \(or regional\) law has always been done by the national / member state authorities and therefore always adapted to specific realities in the various countries of the EU.
1.9.4. Con: The EU issues and enforces directives made to serve the interest of the EU citizens. The UK is [already struggling](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-44155590) to enforce the clean air directives on its own.
1.9.5. Pro: The EU is incompatible with English Common Law and Constitutional Monarchy. [Macarthys Ltd v Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macarthys_Ltd_v_Smith) is an example of the two conflicting. [Conflict of constitutional law in the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law#Conflict_of_laws) concisely explains how the two principles of governance can collide.
1.9.5.1. Con: The cases cited, and the Wikipedia article referenced, do not support the claim that the EU is "incompatible". On the contrary, they demonstrate that there are viable mechanisms to examine and resolve any cases where there is a conflict.
1.9.6. Con: Any ceding of power to the EU happens only as a result of conscious decisions by each member state's own legislature, through the mechanisms of the [EU Council of Ministers](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/council-eu_en). When a state agrees to grant primacy to EU regulations, the decision to do so will thus have been taken in accordance with that state's own democratic processes, and in order to further the interests of that state within the broader European and global environment.
1.9.7. Con: This is only the case for certain things that have to be done on a larger scale like import tariffs, defense, etc.
1.9.8. Con: Though there may be issues with increased centralisation, a total severance of ties is overkill and is much more destructive than healthy conversation and reformation.
1.10. Pro: Only by remaining in the EU would the UK be capable of contributing to EU reform.
1.10.1. Con: The leaders of the EU wish to lead the EU toward closer integration and has demonstrated that it does not want reform in the way that the UK voters do.
1.10.1.1. Con: UK is still one of the leading EU nations right now. Judging by the size of the population, numbers of the MEP's and size of the financial contributions.
1.10.2. Pro: In order to trade with the EU in the future the UK would need to unilaterally accept the standards of the EEA without having input on creating them.
1.10.3. Con: The EU's existence violates the concept of [Westphalian Sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty) gained from the European Wars of Religion, it is inherently bad and therefore irreformable.
1.10.3.1. Con: The [EU](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu_en) is a voluntary association of independent sovereign states. Its existence absolutely does not violate any concept of sovereignty.
1.10.4. Pro: The UK no longer has the leverage over countries outside Europe that it used to; therefore we will not be able to make deals with those countries that are equally beneficial to both sides.
1.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.
1.11. Pro: Leaving the European Union is likely to be economically catastrophic.
1.11.1. Pro: Brexit will [negatively affect](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42257277) London's talent pool.
1.11.2. Con: The EU [has expressed](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jan/20/macron-says-a-bespoke-trade-deal-between-the-uk-and-eu-is-possible) its willingness to agree both a transmission deal and a full FTA with the UK thereafter, which will mitigate the negative effects of leaving the EU.
1.11.3. Pro: The British economy is already suffering as a consequence of Brexit.
1.11.3.1. Pro: The British government is revising the country's economic growth given [evidence of downturn](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/12/uk-economy-shows-greatest-signs-of-stress-since-2012).
1.11.3.2. Pro: Reports say that leaving is already costing [£500 million a week](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-economy/brexit-has-cost-britain-500-million-pounds-a-week-study-says-idUKKCN1MA0DU).
1.11.4. Pro: The devaluation of the pound would be the most terrible blow to the heart of the UK, which is an importing nation.
1.11.4.1. Con: It would help UK exports be more competitive.
1.11.5. Con: Almost all of the 'project fear' predictions about this issue didn't come true post-referendum.
1.11.5.1. Con: The UK has not yet left the EU, so it's too soon to judge.
1.11.6. Pro: Multiple economic bodies have predicted a weaker economy for the UK, in the long term, outside of the Union.
1.11.6.1. Pro: The [OECD](https://www.ft.com/content/57773be4-d426-11e7-8c9a-d9c0a5c8d5c9) predicts weak economic growth for the UK due to Brexit.
1.11.6.2. Pro: The [EIU](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/brexit-damage-uk-economy-eiu-vote-eu-recession) warns the damage from a decision to leave the EU will be felt until at least 2020.
1.11.6.3. Pro: A leaked [UK government forecast](http://www.dw.com/en/brexit-will-leave-uk-worse-off-in-every-scenario-leaked-report-predicts/a-42360406) reportedly predicts that the British economy will suffer no matter what trade deal is struck with the European Union.
1.11.7. Con: Leaving the EU does not mean we are no longer a European country that has nothing to offer the EU. Capitalism ensures business will continue especially with what Britain has to offer.
1.11.8. Con: The EU is the [slowest growing market](https://fullfact.org/economy/global-economic-growth/) in the world today. Leaving would allow Britain to establish bilateral trade with growing markets, i.e. MERCOSUR, SE Asia, while still in their in infancy, allowing better terms to be established than with traditionally economically strong nations.
1.11.8.1. Con: Rate of growth of an economic association is not a proxy for its value to a member state. Smaller size organisations typically exhibit higher growth rates but their total increase in value may still be significantly less than that of a much larger organisation with a slower growth rate. 5% of a very big number is a bigger quantity than 50% of a very small number.
1.11.9. Pro: There is a very high cost involved in duplicating a lot of EU backed institutions on a national level \(for example European Drug Agency, or the aviation regulators\)
1.11.10. Con: Many fringe nations perform better, per capita, outside of the EU.
1.11.10.1. Con: North African nations are definitely less rich than European ones.
1.11.10.2. Con: Turkey and Belarus aren't democratic.
1.11.10.3. Con: Russia has a weaker economy than many european nations.
1.11.10.4. Con: Norway owns a huge supply of oil.
1.11.10.5. Con: Switzerland is a tax heaven and what's more it's a confederation.
1.11.11. Con: For the EU to allow such a catastrophe in the UK would transform it into a union based on economic duress rather than mutual co-operation.
1.11.11.1. Con: This is irrelevant; there is no argument here that tells us Brexit would be better for the UK.
1.11.11.2. Con: One cannot expect the benefits of being a club member without actually being one.
1.11.11.3. Con: If the UK chooses to leave the EU then there is no treaty or any other obligation on the EU to provide economic protection for a departing member state.
1.11.11.4. Pro: Article 50 exists to indicate that nations joining the EU are not trapped in it. If Brexit proved that nations were in effect trapped in the EU by the threat of economic consequences, this could be seen as federalism or imperialism by other nations with levels of Euroscepticism or a desire for EU reform.
1.12. Pro: The UK and the EU share a history and a common culture.
1.12.1. Con: We have no particular historical connection with all EU nations, such as Slovenia or Lithuania.
1.12.2. Con: We also have highly important relationships with countries outside the EU - notably the United States and the Commonwealth.
1.12.3. Pro: British alliances and wars with [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations) and [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations) stretch back hundreds of years.
1.12.3.1. Con: The UK been at war with all of these countries several times stretching back hundreds of years.
1.12.4. Pro: [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Portuguese_Alliance) was one of Britain's first allies.
1.12.5. Pro: [Cyprus and Malta](http://www.civitas.org.uk/content/files/MS.12.Cyprus-and-Malta.pdf) were British overseas territories.
1.12.5.1. Con: The ROI gained their independence a 100 of years ago as well. So what that they were British colonies if they are sovereign states today.
