Discussion Title: Should we eliminate limits on individual campaign contributions in exchange for a ban on corporate/PAC donations?

1. Should we eliminate limits on individual campaign contributions in exchange for a ban on corporate/PAC donations?
1.1. Con: In the wake of banning corporate donations, donations by groups fighting for good causes, such as unions or NGOs, would be banned too.
1.2. Pro: If individual contributions are disclosed, it would promote transparency by allowing voters to see who is supporting a particular candidate.
1.3. Pro: Removing the cap on individual limits would reduce the likelihood of constitutional challenges.
1.4. Con: Corporations and PACs are a form of free speech and free assembly.  Restricting them would be a violation of the 1st Amendment
1.5. Pro: Business owners and those who care strongly about a particular issue would still be able to speak and have influence in campaigns.
1.6. Con: Allowing unlimited personal contributions does nothing to reduce the influence of money in politics.
1.7. Con: Organizations and corporations could still have coordinated efforts to encourage people to vote a certain way.
1.8. Con: A corporation or PAC could still engage in other forms of political speech other than providing direct contributions.
1.9. Pro: Allowing corporate or union donations allows for members/shareholder's money to be used to support candidates/polcies they may not agree with.
1.9.1. Con: Many politicians are more attracted by the benefits after they left office, such as former German Chancellor [Gerhard Schr√∂der](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Schr%C3%B6der) who is now the chairman of Rosneft.
