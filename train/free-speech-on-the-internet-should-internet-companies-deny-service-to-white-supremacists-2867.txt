Discussion Title: Free Speech on the Internet: Should Internet Companies Deny Service to White Supremacists?

1. Internet companies are wrong in denying services to white supremacists.
1.1. Pro: The information posted online by white supremacists can be used for counterterrorism operations against groups that are deemed a threat, or to investigate crimes.
1.1.1. Con: White supremacists deserve privacy just like any other individual in society does. Regardless of whether they should be censored, they should not be subject to extra surveillance simply because they hold views that are objectionable to some.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Counterterrorism is orchestrated by governments, not independent companies. Governments have already made it clear - including in democracies like [the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/07/uk-intelligence-agencies-face-surveillance-claims-in-european-court) - that they consider the only way to combat terrorism is "to intercept a substantially greater volume of communications". If Internet companies comply with governments to censor and investigate even when there is [no wrongdoing](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13718768/uk-surveillance-laws-explained-investigatory-powers-bill), that constitutes an invasion of privacy on a large scale, counterterrorism notwithstanding.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Anonymity is a vital part of Internet discussions, particularly for white supremacists who may wish to conceal their \(contentious\) viewpoints from those who disagree, including employers. Free speech on the Internet is massively [facilitated by](https://www.eff.org/issues/anonymity) anonymity; regardless of personal views, anonymity should be preserved.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: The right to privacy is not absolute. If it comes at the cost of real world harms to minorities, this right should be curtailed.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Islamist terrorist factions [use the internet](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/terrorists-and-internet) for exchanging information and recruiting activities. Clearly privacy is of no relevance when it comes at the cost of lives and liberty.
1.1.1.3. Con: Publicly available information, even without dedicated surveillance, can yield important insights into the activities of white supremacists.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: White supremacist Robert Poplawski, who gunned down three police officers in 2009, had left an [easily followed trail of postings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/26/alt-america-terrorism-rightwing-hate-crimes) on the internet that gave the public a good deal of insight into his actions. Many of these were on white- nationalist websites such as Don Black’s Stormfront, where Poplawski had an account to which he regularly posted.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: In Germany, antifascist groups have long used information available online to map [extremist rightwing networks](https://www.vice.com/de/article/a334nj/mit-dem-indymedia-verbot-haben-sich-die-behorden-selbst-ins-bein-geschossen). Using this method, they were the first to catch onto a right-wing terrorist group that travelled through the country and murdered people of Turkish descent.
1.1.2. Con: White supremacists can be "shadowbanned" \(e.g. allowed to post, but the posts are not visible to others\) to allow for collection of counter-terrorism information while preventing the spread of their ideas.
1.1.3. Pro: Surveillance of terrorist organizations' Facebook and Twitter activities provides intelligence agencies with valuable access to their [digital footprints](https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-05-13/how-isis-recruits-online-using-encryption-chat-rooms-and-even-dating-sites), which provides information about the group's tactics, members, and sympathizers.
1.1.3.1. Pro: "Social monitoring" is a way of finding terrorist sympathizers and therefore protecting society.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The FBI found and arrested ISIS sympathisers by social [monitoring](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/01/isis-america-twitter-social-media-radicalisation).
1.1.3.2. Pro: Pro-ISIS posts by American and British citizens have actually been the [catalyst](http://www.thedailybeast.com/jailed-for-twitter-terrorism-supporting-isis-and-al-qaeda) for various criminal convictions. Had these people not been allowed to post on Twitter, they may never have been caught by law enforcement before it was too late.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Sometimes posts on terrorist social media accounts provide clues to upcoming attacks, which can give law enforcement an advantage in attack prevention.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: In July 2015, open-source intelligence that was gathered from social media and passed to the FBI led to the [prevention](http://www.popsci.com/terror-on-twitter-how-isis-is-taking-war-to-social-media) of a terror attack in Tunisia as well as the arrest of nearly a dozen militants.
1.1.3.4. Con: Groups like ISIS could very easily use social media to post red herrings about their operations or intended targets. If intelligence agencies chase down these false leads then it will be a massive waste of valuable time and manpower.
1.1.3.5. Pro: As long as terrorist organisations use Facebook or Twitter, Western intelligence services have a chance of tracking their activity and gathering intelligence. If their accounts start to be deleted aggressively, they might move to other less accessible platforms.
1.1.3.5.1. Con: Groups like ISIS have already begun to move most of their online interactions to [encrypted apps](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kb7n4a/isis-messaging-apps), so it will make little difference going forward should Facebook and Twitter become more or less aggressive in their account monitoring.
1.1.3.5.2. Pro: When Facebook started cracking down on extreme right-wing groups, neo-nazi groups such as the US-based  "United Aryan Front" started to use the [Russian network VKontakte](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/extremist-groups-vkontakte/483426/) instead.
1.1.3.6. Con: As of [June 2017](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/06/07/net-extremists-drop-twitter-telegram), ISIS' use of Twitter and Facebook have significantly decreased, particularly in recruitment efforts. Thus the removal of associated accounts from these sites will likely have little effect on counter-terrorist operations.
1.1.4. Pro: If users look for or spread terror propaganda on social media, they can easily be identified and [specifically targeted](http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/youtube-redirect-terrorism-searches-anti-hate-videos-1202501297/) with deradicalisation campaigns.
1.1.5. Con: White supremacists are not terrorists. To treat them as such misunderstands the ideology.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Simply holding or expressing the view that whites are superior to other races should not qualify a person as a terrorist. Only if they perform or incite acts of violence should they be considered a terrorist.
1.1.5.2. Con: Intelligence agencies describe white supremacy as an 'extremist movement', and consider it to be a domestic threat.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: The FBI has said that white supremacists "were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 … more than any other [domestic extremist movement](https://www.axios.com/fbi-and-dhs-reported-months-ago-white-supremacys-lethal-threat-2472924837.html)'. The intelligence agencies in the US clearly designate white supremacy as an extremist movement.
1.1.5.2.2. Pro: The Department of Homeland Security in the US has issued a report titled '[White Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3924852-White-Supremacist-Extremism-JIB.html)'. The Department clearly treats the movement as a threat sufficient to deem it as extremist.
1.1.5.2.3. Con: Yet the most public of white supremacists who regularly encourage violence are [not](https://www.theroot.com/why-arent-white-supremacists-on-the-terror-watchlist-1798315732) on any terrorist watch list, and have not had any action taken against them.
1.1.5.2.4. Pro: The FBI is conducting roughly 1000 investigations into white supremacists, roughly the same number of probes as those into groups driven by radical Islamist ideology. The FBI clearly considers them to be an [equal threat](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/fbi-white-nationalists-isis-threat-nazis-alt-right-trump-muslim-groups-terrorism-report-a7972136.html).
1.1.5.3. Con: The watch list requirement that defines a terrorist activity in the US [includes](https://www.theroot.com/why-arent-white-supremacists-on-the-terror-watchlist-1798315732) trying to “influence the policy of a government by intimidation ... or affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction.” Before the Charlottesville rally, white supremacists said they wanted to stop the city government’s already cemented decision to remove the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
1.1.5.4. Pro: Such speech comes from a belief that whites themselves are [oppressed](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/the-worlds-worst-support-group/536850/), and that their space in the democratic process is being taken away from them. It hardly seems fair to further oppress those who believe themselves to be victims.
1.1.5.4.1. Pro: The [National Association for the Advancement of White People](http://naawp.org.tripod.com/) \(NAAWP\) was set up by white supremacists to 'stop the genocide of people of all faiths, colors and cultures on earth', including the genocide of 'American white culture'. To suppress a group that already perceives itself to be under attack is wrong.
1.1.5.4.2. Con: Simply believing that one is justified in committing a morally reprehensible action does not excuse such actions, exempt individuals from retaliation or alleviate associated punishments.
1.1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Even if all Nazis in World War II Germany deeply believed that they were threatened by every single Jewish person and their only way to survive was to commit genocide, this would not excuse their actions or render any of the judgements for their heinous crimes any less justified.
1.1.5.4.2.2. Pro: In many jurisdictions, defendants who want to argue self-defence are required to prove that they feared for their life and that the [average person](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-to-make-a-self-defense-claim) would have acted the same way. Simply believing they acted in self-defence is insufficient.
1.1.5.4.2.3. Con: Racism need not manifest in punishable action. Simply holding racist views - or any other behaviour that does not have a negative consequence in reality, including online discussion - is not sufficient grounds to merit punishment.
1.1.5.4.2.3.1. Con: In the context of this discussion, the behaviour \(online dissemination of white supremacist ideology\) does in fact engender a negative consequence in reality \(establishing an ethno-state necessitates racial violence\). The punishment \(exclusion from the online service\) is an appropriate measure to assist in discouraging the behaviour.
1.1.5.4.3. Pro: White supremacists are [motivated](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/8/15/16141456/renaud-camus-the-great-replacement-you-will-not-replace-us-charlottesville-white) by the fear that they, their culture and their history are being replaced by foreign cultures. Preventing them from accessing online platforms simply feeds into that fear.
1.1.5.4.3.1. Pro: US Census Bureau projects that whites will be [a minority](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/12/21/white.persecution/index.html) in the US by 2050.
1.1.5.4.3.2. Pro: '[Whiteness Studies](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/12/21/white.persecution/index.html)' started to crop up in minor universities in the 1990s, and are spreading into larger universities, as a response to the perceived erasure of white history.
1.1.5.4.4. Con: People may believe that whites are oppressed, but this is clearly [not true](https://www.salon.com/2017/08/13/sorry-mr-president-white-people-are-not-oppressed-in-america/). Racism is not an opinion. There are facts and theoretical frameworks that can be used to evaluate its many dimensions.
1.1.5.4.4.1. Pro: Criteria that can be used to evaluate whether groups are oppressed [include](https://mrdevin.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/five-faces-of-oppression.pdf) exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism and violence. These criteria can also be empirically evaluated. White Americans as a group have [never suffered](https://www.salon.com/2017/08/13/sorry-mr-president-white-people-are-not-oppressed-in-america/) from any of these various aspects of oppression.
1.1.5.4.4.2. Con: Even if it is not true, it seems unfair to respond to the perception of being discriminated by actually discrimination against them.
1.1.5.4.5. Pro: The average white American believes that anti-white bias is a [bigger problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/21/white-people-think-racism-is-getting-worse-against-white-people/?utm_term=.9d10edb3b392) in the US than anti-black bias.
1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.7. Con: The use of the internet to spread irrational, radicalised speech to disenfranchised, vulnerable and/or mentally ill people is [causing a rise in terrorism,](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Gartenstein-Ross-Statement-Radicalization-9-14.pdf) which is why it is easier to catch terrorists.
1.1.8. Con: Yet an online presence also allows white supremacists to organise and carry out such acts. It is better to prevent them from ever happening, rather than to allow them to happen and hope that counterterrorism agencies will catch them in time.
1.1.8.1. Pro: There are more opportunities for random acts of terrorism, which increases the likelihood of a violent act against an individual, as [Andrew Anglin](https://www.jta.org/2017/12/05/news-opinion/united-states/neo-nazi-andrew-anglin-says-his-call-for-troll-storm-against-jewish-woman-is-protected-free-speech) did with a Jewish real estate agent in Montana.
1.2. Pro: Such a move is morally inconsistent as long as it is only applied to the far right.
1.2.1. Pro: The incitement of violence is not unique to white supremacists.
1.2.1.1. Con: Punching people is in no way comparable to directly calling for or indirectly proposing the mass murder of whole ethnic or religious groups.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Past efforts to create a white ethnostate also started with separatism, a clamp-down on immigration, and attempted deportation, before moving on to the Holocaust.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Richard Spencer has been an advocate for "[Peaceful Ethnic Cleansing](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/richard-bertrand-spencer-0)". He cites the national boundaries drawn at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference as an example of this. “Today, in the public imagination, ‘ethnic cleansing’ has been associated with civil war and mass murder \(understandably so\),” Spencer said. “But this need not be the case. 1919 is a real example of successful ethnic redistribution—done by fiat, we should remember, but done peacefully.”
1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Anti-Jewish legislation was introduced almost ten years before the Nazi government [officially began the organised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannsee_Conference) mass-slaughter of Jews across Europe, e.g. by limiting the number of Jewish students in universities and schools and excluding them from a number of professions in [1933](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007901).
1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: The German Nazi government considered deporting all German Jews to [Madagascar, Palestine or Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution) before definitely choosing to commit systematic genocide as the "final solution". All plans involving mass deportation were discarded as unfeasible.
1.2.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Since they did not consider Jews human, the Nazis treated the Jewish population as a problem to be solved in order to achieve their version of a "white ethnostate". Since they had this worldview, they simply considered systematic genocide the most efficient way of achieving this goal. Since they hold similar ideas, white supremacists are likely to go a similar route should they ever hold power anywhere.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Prominent white supremacist Richard Spencer openly advocates turning North America into a "[white ethnostate](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/richard-bertrand-spencer-0)". Given that people of colour in North America have no reason to leave, Spencer's goal can de facto only be accomplished by using violence to force them out. Thus, whoever promotes ideas such as Spencer's indirectly promotes violence.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Supporting government policies of violence is different than inciting violence directly. Supporters of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants are allowed to advocate for the government to use violence towards this end so long as they do not commit, or advocate for, acts of violence themselves.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This is a false comparison. The scale of removing all non-white Americans as well as its legitimacy \(given they are legal citizens\) makes it an entirely different issue.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Incitement of violence against white supremacists is no different than incitement of violence against other groups. If white supremacists must be censored to protect other groups, then those who endanger the lives of white supremacists must be censored as well
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: There are already suggestions of this: although it started as a more tongue-in-cheek Internet meme, it is now widespread, and articles exist [instructing people](https://www.inverse.com/article/35496-punch-a-nazi-charlottesville-rally-protest) in how to a punch a Nazi legally. In practise, this meme has now become pre-meditated assault.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Comedian Kathy Griffin was [famously photographed](http://www.tmz.com/2017/09/14/kathy-griffin-trump-beheading-photo-hot-ticket-item-prints/) with a bloodied severed head of Donald Trump; this implicit threat became mainstream news, mostly devoid of condemnation. This is indicative of the insidious mounting violence from the left that is being condoned and normalised.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: It is unreasonable to assume that a comedian using violent imagery is seriously implying that she wants to physically hurt the US president. If Griffin's behaviour could be considered a credible threat, she would have been apprehended and tried accordingly.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Con: Kathy Griffin was [criticised](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4569118/Kathy-Griffin-feels-betrayed-CNN-s-Anderson-Cooper.html) by media personalities that supposedly represent the left.
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: [Experts](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/16/533255619/fact-check-is-left-wing-violence-rising#) in political extremism are starting to acknowledge that anti-white supremacist murders are 'only a matter of time', in part because the line between mainstream and extreme is 'increasingly blurred'.
1.2.1.3. Con: Attacks on white supremacists can be understood as acts of self-defence.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The state often fails at and is historically disinterested in protecting ethnic and religious minorities from far-right violence, so combatting nazis is a necessity.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: In Germany, the terror cell NSU was able to murder people of Turkish descent throughout the country for years, partially thanks to [close contacts](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/nsu-prozess-in-muenchen-warum-die-terrorzelle-so-lange-unbehelligt-blieb-1.2215609) between the police and far-right groups.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Many of the protections [afforded by the US constitution](https://mic.com/articles/121536/this-is-who-our-constitution-doesn-t-protect-and-what-we-can-do-to-change-that#.kAkJm0VMf) in theory are not afforded to black Americans in practice.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Such calls are simply reactions to white supremacists calling for attacks on ethnic and religious minorities.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: The state has historically been complicit in the white supremacist project of oppressing people of colour, so they cannot be trusted to protect them from white supremacists.
1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: If the state cannot be trusted with the protection of minorities, there is no reason to believe that internet companies can either.
1.2.1.3.3.2. Pro: In the US, police brutality, direct state violence, primarily affects [communities of colour](https://www.vox.com/cards/police-brutality-shootings-us/us-police-racism).
1.2.1.3.3.3. Pro: The original constitution of the United States did not even consider African Americans people.
1.2.1.3.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.2.
1.2.1.3.3.5. Pro: Almost all Western states condoned the enslavement of people of colour in the past and had to be convinced to change their mind.
1.2.1.3.4. Con: Vigilante justice is always unjustified, since the state is the sole actor that can legitimately employ violence.
1.2.1.3.4.1. Con: By failing to defend its citizens against far-right violence, the state effectively forfeits this right.
1.2.1.3.5. Pro: White supremacists directly or indirectly always advocate violence, so those they target need to defend themselves against these attacks.
1.2.1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.2.1.4. Pro: The concept of 'punch a Nazi' went viral, leading many white supremacists to fear for their personal safety; yet, there are no suggestions to censor those holding that viewpoint.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: It is never acceptable for anybody to fear for their safety, or their lives, from people of different political affiliations. 'Punch a Nazi' is part of a new rhetoric that explicitly calls for the destruction of all white supremacists - however violently, or unpleasantly, that may be achieved.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: This is evidenced in the media response. An act of assault - Richard Spencer being punched in the face - would, were it anybody else from any other political minority, be seen as appalling and inexcusable. Instead, major news outlets were [vocally supportive](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2017/08/it-ok-punch-nazi), [glorifying](https://www.thenation.com/article/if-you-appreciated-seeing-neo-nazi-richard-spencer-get-punched-thank-the-black-bloc/) the assault and encouraging others.
1.2.1.5. Con: Every threat to public safety and people's lives needs to be assessed on its own merits. If white supremacists pose a threat to the public, this threat needs to be addressed, regardless of what else is out there.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: If there were threats to the lives of both babies and women, the fact that the government might first focus on protecting babies for a variety of reasons, but neglect protecting women, does not make it any less necessary to protect babies.
1.2.1.5.2. Pro: White supremacists threaten and endanger a variety of ethnic, religious and other societal groups whose members live all across the world.
1.2.1.5.2.1. Con: Censorship is ineffective in actually protecting the victims of white supremacy.
1.2.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: If restrictions on speech are implemented under conditions of inequality, these restrictions are just another tool available to those already in power for oppressing minority groups. Censorship is thus likely to harm those it is supposed to protect.
1.2.1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: If a state implements laws on hate speech, while positions of economic, political or social power are dominated by members of one social group, the definition of "hate speech" is likely to reflect their perspective rather than that of disadvantaged minority groups.
1.2.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Studies suggest that censorship is ineffective due to the [ease of circumnavigation](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78095/Ofcom_Site-Blocking-_report_with_redactions_vs2.pdf); it is a waste of time and money.
1.2.1.5.2.1.3. Pro: The act of censorship and the huge media controversy surrounding it increase white supremacists' profiles more than merely giving them a platform would. Constant reporting and analysis means that white supremacy is perpetually in the public consciousness.
1.2.1.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: Shutting down a white supremacist website or dropping a particular user [guarantees them a measure of publicity](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446920/internet-ban-nazis-white-supremacist-hosting-providers-charlottesville). Sites banned for allowing white supremacist speech were boosted by being banned when they found alternative domains.
1.2.1.5.2.1.3.1.1. Con: This increase is often a temporary one, confined to one new's cycle when the ban is making headlines. Once the immediate attention subsides, people don't visit those websites on non-mainstream domains.
1.2.1.5.2.1.3.1.2. Con: The Daily Stormer's Alexa ranking, which measures the popularity of a website, [dropped](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446920/internet-ban-nazis-white-supremacist-hosting-providers-charlottesville) from 13,000 in April 2017 to 136,000 when it went on the Icelandic domain, and then further down to 368,000 when it went onto a Catalonian domain name. Being dropped by internet companies clearly has a marked effect on the traffic of such websites.
1.2.1.5.2.1.4. Con: There is [emerging research](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/business/reddit-limits-noxious-content-by-giving-trolls-fewer-places-to-gather.html?mcubz=0) to suggest that targeting radical users on a single platform can help control their negative behaviour. For example, once kicked off one subforum on Reddit, the way users speak and behave tends to be modified when they emerge in another. This strongly indicates that censorship is vital in changing behaviours and protecting victims.
1.2.1.5.2.1.5. Pro: Censorship is dangerous for the potential victims of white supremacy: in a world where people use the Internet to meet new people, go on dates, etc, being able to identify dangerous bigots in the 'real world' is considerably easier when they aren't hiding behind Internet anonymity.
1.2.1.5.2.1.5.1. Pro: Pushing white supremacists underground could give the misleading impression that there is no longer a problem or threat. White supremacists would become essentially invisible, but it would neither reduce their numbers, nor tackle their extremist views.
1.2.1.5.2.1.5.2. Con: Yet if white supremacists are not allowed on social media or other websites which facilitate interaction between people, there is no need to identify them before hand.
1.2.1.5.2.1.5.3. Con: White supremacists, especially those who wish to attack individuals directly, often adopt anonymous profiles; identification, in such situations, never occurs.
1.2.1.5.2.1.6. Pro: Censorship only builds the sense of [persecution and paranoia](http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/what-happens-when-the-internet-tries-to-silence-white-supremacy-20170828) that white supremacist groups thrive on, increasing the likelihood of violence.
1.2.1.5.2.2. Pro: Threats of violence or death against individuals are already illegal in most countries since they are aimed at instilling fear in the victim. By the same logic, threats against groups of people should equally be illegal and companies are justified in refusing to host them.
1.2.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: In the UK, inducing fear of or provoking violence is a [statutory offence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_or_provocation_of_violence).
1.2.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: The dividing line between threats against individuals and groups is blurry, so the logic of such laws should also apply to threats against groups of people.
1.2.1.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: If someone threatened to kill all three people of colour in a small village, this is almost indistinguishable from threats against an individual.
1.2.1.5.2.2.3. Pro: Threats against groups of people are even worse, since they induce fear in a large group of individuals rather than just one specific person.
1.2.1.5.2.2.4. Con: Threats of violence against a whole section of society are much less credible than those against an individual, so they cannot be treated as if they induced the same level of fear.
1.2.1.5.2.2.4.1. Con: If these threats come from a group of people \(such as white supremacists\) or are issued in a country where individuals have access to weapons that can easily kill a high number of people \(such as the US\), they should be considered credible.
1.2.1.5.2.2.4.2. Pro: Even if a few individuals said that they wanted to physically attack all people of colour in a given country, this would be unfeasible.
1.2.1.5.2.2.4.3. Con: It is not possible to determine an acceptable level of fear for one's life. Given that most societies ban death threats and accept that no individual should have to fear for their life, all threats inducing such kind of fear can be banned or censored.
1.2.1.5.2.3. Con: Censorship of an entire political belief system is a direct attack on those who subscribe to that belief system. Going after one group to protect another is not morally justifiable.
1.2.1.5.2.3.1. Con: These two are not morally equivalent: The groups this policy aims to protect are being targeted because of innate characteristics such as their race and have done nothing wrong. White supremacists, on the other hand, are censored because they vilify and threaten innocent citizens.
1.2.1.5.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.
1.2.1.5.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.1.3.
1.2.1.5.2.5. Pro: Being able to express and defend one's ideas means power, so refusing to give a platform to white supremacists weakens them.
1.2.1.5.2.5.1. Pro: During 2014 and 2015, fewer than 20 organisations identified as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center \(SPLC\) [raised more than $20 million by using payment processors](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/08/companies-white-supremacist-customers/537390/) such as MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, and American Express. This money allows white supremacists to organise themselves and spread their ideas.
1.2.1.5.2.5.2. Con: Allowing white supremacists a platform leaves them vulnerable to more intensive criticism as their audience widens.
1.2.1.5.2.5.2.1. Pro: Parody of extreme views can cause offence and upset, manifested verbally and physically; [the vehemence](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/09/27/germany.satire.apple.front/index.html) of negative response illustrates how allowing a platform \(genuinely or satirically\) can provoke severe criticism.
1.2.1.5.2.5.3. Con: Greater visibility provokes [parody](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-shore-right-parody-20170824-story.html), thus hurting white supremacists in the long run.
1.2.1.5.2.5.3.1. Pro: Parodying extreme views encourages viewers [to think beyond](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H7OEFij0QkgC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=parodying+extreme+views&source=bl&ots=isO4rzCQi0&sig=Fsx0fzBbeY46gFgBRzpgJngXYXI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz46GBg8vXAhUMJ8AKHVg8DsEQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&q=parodying%20extreme%20views&f=false) repeated ideological clichés, and consider these views independently of usual media bias.
1.2.1.5.2.5.3.2. Pro: Parody is considered [an effective way](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/09/27/germany.satire.apple.front/index.html) to undermine support for far-right groups; it picks up on absurdities, including their dress, rhetoric and symbolism.
1.2.1.5.2.5.3.3. Con: Parody can encounter what is colloquially known as "[Poe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law)": that it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views that is sufficiently exaggerated to not be mistaken by some as a sincere expression of the parodied views. As such, parody could be considered dangerous, by unintentionally garnering support whilst intending to achieve the opposite.
1.2.1.5.2.5.3.4. Con: The effects of parody are likely to be short-lived; some people may parody ideas they disapprove of but be threatened or [hurt](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/26/mauritanian-journalist-death-sentenced-for-insulting-the-prophet_n_6380442.html) by holders of those ideas without hurting the idea. A strict censorship of white supremacism would be more effective and safer.
1.2.1.5.2.5.4. Con: Being able to express and defend one's ideas is a natural right of all people. This particular protection must extend even to non-mainstream and repugnant ideas or it does not exist at all.
1.2.1.5.2.5.5. Con: On the contrary, the more white supremacists are censored, the greater the uproar around the issue. That means white supremacists are discussed by more people in the news for a longer period of time, bringing even more exposure to their ideology.
1.2.1.5.2.5.5.1. Pro: Fox News anchor Pete Hegseth [defended](https://www.salon.com/2017/08/13/peter-hegseth-on-fox-and-friends-defends-white-nationalists-in-charlottesville/) those who attended the Charlottesville rally as simple Americans who felt that their country was slipping away from them, even though most of them were explicit white nationalists. This sort of discussion normalises white supremacy and helps spread it.
1.2.1.5.2.5.5.2. Pro: By arguing that '[mainstream media](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fox-news-charlottesville-blame-mainstream-media-neo-nazis-donald-trump-abby-huntsman-pete-hegseth-a7894786.html)' was to blame for the violence at Charlottesville, white supremacy can appear innocent of violent tendencies, increasing its appeal.
1.2.1.5.2.5.5.3. Pro: When singled out, white supremacists often [re-direct](http://uk.businessinsider.com/neo-nazis-celebrate-trumps-remarks-about-charlottesville-riots-2017-8?r=US&IR=T) the conversation towards equating themselves with antifa, or the 'violent left'. This is a discussion that undermines the uniquely horrible nature of white supremacism: believing whites are better than non-whites.
1.2.1.5.2.5.5.3.1. Pro: Such rhetoric, especially when [repeated](http://uk.businessinsider.com/neo-nazis-celebrate-trumps-remarks-about-charlottesville-riots-2017-8?r=US&IR=T) by the President of the US, can convince others that white supremacism isn't actually all that bad. It's much better to let white supremacists air their views and allow people to judge them on their own merits.
1.2.1.5.2.5.5.4. Con: The [predominant](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/13/civil-rights-inquiry-for-charlottesville-rally-death) [discussion](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/us/trump-charlottesville-protest-nationalist-riot.html) after Charlottesville and the censoring of The Daily Stormer has been [critical](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/13/politics/congress-charlottesville-white-supremacy-white-house-donald-trump/index.html) of [white](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjx58n/congresss-historic-move-forces-trump-to-condemn-white-supremacy) [supremacy](http://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2017/august/trump-evangelical-advisers-charlottesville-white-supremacis.html), painting it in a [negative](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/why-military-chiefs-are-condemning-white-supremacy/537174/) light. It is unlikely that more people will sympathise with white supremacist ideology after such scathing coverage.
1.2.1.5.2.5.5.4.1. Pro: Congress went so far as to pass a resolution which [singled out](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/13/politics/congress-charlottesville-white-supremacy-white-house-donald-trump/index.html) white supremacists, condemning them for their part in the violence during the Charlottesville rally. This is not the kind of favourable coverage which will attract anyone towards this ideology.
1.2.1.5.2.5.5.5. Con: This would be a short-term uproar. It would effectively still be harder to proclaim white supremacism, so white supremacism would surely diminish in the long run.
1.2.1.5.2.5.5.5.1. Con: White supremacists have been a [constant](http://abcnews.go.com/US/state-white-supremacy-neo-nazi-groups-us/story?id=49205764) part of American society. Lack of public visibility is not going to stem the movement.
1.2.1.5.2.5.5.5.2. Con: US intelligence agencies have been [reporting a rise in the threat](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/14/fbi-and-dhs-warned-of-growing-threat-from-white-supremacists-months-ago/) from white supremacist groups: taking them offline does not hinder their growth.
1.2.1.5.2.5.5.5.3. Con: The change in political rhetoric, especially by politicians such as Trump, has [emboldened](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/08/charlottesville-violence-gives-white-supremacist-movement-the-attention-it-wanted-professor-says/) white supremacists to take to the streets to defend their ideology. It is unlikely that this movement will simply accept mass censorship of its views.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6. Pro: Taking away this platform forces white supremacist groups to use less mainstream services. Less mainstream services have less consumers. This means that white supremacist groups can not spread their message amongst as many people as they once could.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1. Pro: This hampers the ability of white supremacist groups to organise massive rallies or protests, as they cannot advertise to a lot of people.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.1. Pro: Neo-nazi websites like The Daily Stormer [helped organise](http://www.dw.com/en/internet-companies-join-backlash-against-neo-nazi-groups/a-40129305) the rally where a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 people were injured when a man drove a car into protesters demonstrating against a white nationalist rally. By denying service to such websites, white supremacists can't organise as effectively as they otherwise can.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2. Pro: White supremacists can use Facebook to set up event pages to organise rallies and protests, and the more rallies they organise, the more attention they attract, to both themselves and their cause. Preventing them from using Facebook is crucial to limiting their organisational ability.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1. Pro: Since they own their platforms, Internet companies have the right to decide who gets to publish on them, and who does not.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.1. Pro: Any company which publishes with some editorial discretion is engaging in speech by doing so. If it is wrong to censor hate speech, it is also wrong to force a publisher to publish it.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.2. Con: Just because internet companies have the legal right to make these decisions does not mean the decisions are correct. Being able to do something is not the same as being morally correct in doing them.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Defending white supremacy could never be morally right in and of itself. Disregarding broader implications of censorship, the narrow issue of white supremacy is one where companies clearly have a moral perogative to act on their conscience.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3. Pro: Internet companies have a [moral obligation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computing-responsibility/) to censor white supremacism.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: By providing internet services to white supremacists, internet companies are [profiting off](http://bloodmoney.org/) of the activity of such groups.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2. Con: Internet companies don't have any moral obligations.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: The '[legal compliance](http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/news/corporations-moral-status-of)' view of corporations argues that corporations only have legal obligations, and have no responsibility to behave in the manner one would expect of an individual.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.2. Con: "Morality begins before the law does, and goes beyond what the law may require" \(De George, 2006\); [this view](http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/news/corporations-moral-status-of) would render all corporations full moral agents.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.3. Con: The broad criticism of companies like Starbucks for [voluntary and legal tax avoidance](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19967397) indicates the difference between corporation and individual moral responsibility; if all corporations are absolved of such responsibility, such actions would be considered beyond reproach.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.4. Con: The '[moral person view](http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/news/corporations-moral-status-of)' of corporations views all corporations as moral agents, with rights and responsibilities as such.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5. Pro: Corporations only have a duty towards their shareholders, nothing more.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.1. Pro: This is the only objective, non-arbitrary decision making calculus. If directors were allowed to deviate from shareholder wealth maximisation, they would inevitably turn to [indeterminate balancing standards](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/16/what-are-corporations-obligations-to-shareholders/a-duty-to-shareholder-value), which provide no accountability. As a result, directors could be tempted to pursue their own self-interest.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.1.1. Pro: The decision to censor speech will always be morally arbitrary. Internet companies may want to censor white supremacists, but if that authority belonged to Trump, he would have [censored](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/books/review/free-speech-hate-charlottesville.html?_r=0) the 'alt-left', whom he considers the real threat to American society. It is best to leave speech completely uncensored, otherwise society becomes subject to the whims of the few in power.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.1.1.1. Con: There is no moral ambiguity in a call for ethnic cleansing. One simple litmus test for such speech is "does this statement call for the mass subjugation or murder of humans?"
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.2. Pro: Directors owe [fiduciary duties](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/corporation-owe-fiduciary-duty-shareholders-70243.html) to their shareholders, as the shareholders invest their hard-earned money in the company, trusting that the directors will maximise their returns. For directors to take actions that betray this trust is morally wrong.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.2.1. Pro: This duty has been [recognised](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/3472) by the courts in the US.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.2.2. Pro: Stockholders often have [no control over corporate operations](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/04/16/what-are-corporations-obligations-to-shareholders/its-law-but-it-shouldnt-be), and get nothing if the corporation does not make a profit. Such a duty towards stockholders is important to protect their interests. If dropping white supremacists does not help these stockholders, then they should not be dropped.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3. Con: A corporation's primary duty is towards their consumers, as a contractual service exists between the two. If consumers are being harmed because internet companies facilitate the spread of white supremacist ideology, then this [contractual obligation](https://ethicalrealism.wordpress.com/2011/05/16/moral-issues-related-to-consumers/) is being violated.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1. Pro: By dropping white supremacists, internet companies [significantly reduce](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-protests-tech/internet-firms-shift-stance-move-to-exile-white-supremacists-idUSKCN1AW2L5) the public presence of white supremacists.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: As the experience of [The Daily Stormer](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/20/the-daily-stormer-was-back-online-for-a-quick-second/) shows, if dropped completely by internet companies, white supremacists will barely have an online presence.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.1. Con: The Daily Stormer can still be made accessible on the [Dark Web](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/daily-stormer-has-officially-retreated-to-the-dark-web/) and on mirror websites. If those of Alt-Right persuasion wish to find a platform, they will do so, and their followers will be shortly behind.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This still limits the presence of alt-right content on the internet considerably, as not everyone will access the dark web just for alt-right content.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Once published on the Internet, content can always be found: anybody can easily access [archives](https://web.archive.org/web/20170101022116/http://dailystormer.com/) of The Daily Stormer, even if the site cannot be easily updated anymore.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: If anything, the uproar around banning the site probably raised its public profile, leading more people to read its published content.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.1.3. Con: This still indicates limited accessibility, as people are unlikely to keep following a website that is not reliable and keeps shutting down. The point isn't that The Daily Stormer is not accessible at all, rather that their accessibility has simply decreased.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: This is compounded by the emergence of [Gab.ai](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-38305402), a service aiming to replace Twitter for white supremacists who have been suspended or banned.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.1.4.1. Con: This simply creates an echo-chamber for white supremacists. It still stops their ideology from reaching others, preventing further recruitment and harm to minorities.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.1.4.2. Con: Even [gab.ai has limits](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446920/internet-ban-nazis-white-supremacist-hosting-providers-charlottesville): they deleted content from Andrew Anglin, and suspended Andrew “weev” Auernheimer after he openly encouraged terrorism.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.1.4.3. Con: Larger Internet companies can still exert control over even replacement sites like Gab.ai. For example, Google [blocked the Gab.ai app](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446920/internet-ban-nazis-white-supremacist-hosting-providers-charlottesville) from their PlayStore in the days following Charlottesville.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.1.5. Pro: [Stormfront](https://www.whois.com/whois/stormfront.org), too - which is directly linked to a number of hate-related killings - has found itself a new permanent home despite being originally suspended.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.1.3.1.2.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.2. Pro: The number of active white supremacist groups declined in recent years, yet they have been replaced by a mushrooming [online presence](https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/11/alt-right-and-how-paranoia-white-identity-politics-fuelled-trump-s-rise), where users can hide behind anonymity. If Internet companies begin to censor white supremacist content, they can directly tackle this new type of far right activism.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2. Con: It will be difficult for companies to correctly identify which views are harmful enough to be censored.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.1. Pro: Ideological categories are never clear-cut and often highly contentious, so there will always be someone who disagrees with how a particular incident or act of speech has been classified.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.2. Pro: "Harm" can be defined in a variety of ways. Harm can be physical or emotional. A lot of views may potentially cause harm to varying degrees. It is very difficult, then, to decide what to censor.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3. Pro: A lot of the censorship conducted by tech companies happens through pre-programmed algorithms which can be imperfect, hypocritical and prone to the political biases of their creators.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.1. Pro: In the wake of a terrorist attack in London a U.S. congressman wrote a Facebook post in which he called for the slaughter of “radicalized” Muslims. This racist post advocating violent revenge [went untouched](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms) by Facebook workers and the auto-detection algorithm responsible for deleting offensive speech on the platform.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.2. Pro: A posting on Facebook by Boston poet and Black Lives Matter activist Didi Delgado stating that “All white people are racist. Start from this reference point, or you’ve already failed,” was [removed](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms) and her Facebook account was disabled for seven days.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.3. Pro: All tech companies have [political biases](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/course-facebook-biased-thats-tech-works-today/) that are perpetuated in their algorithms.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.3.1. Pro: It is a common misperception that algorithms are somehow rational. In reality, they can best be understood as [sets of rules determined by humans](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/upshot/when-algorithms-discriminate.html) - and since humans are irrational and biased, they often reproduce these biases when writing code.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: For instance, if programmers are liberals in US politics, they might be inclined to classify liberal media as credible sources, while not doing so for sources like Breitbart or Fox News. If they write an algorithm that is meant to show users more credible news sources, such an algorithm would perpetuate a pro-liberal and anti-conservative bias in their timelines.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.3.2. Con: Algorithms are mere mathematical functions and therewith not biased in themselves.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.3.3. Pro: If the information used to [calibrate an algorithm](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601775/why-we-should-expect-algorithms-to-be-biased/) is [biased](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kH-P9xGy6LoJ:https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/artificial-intelligence-sea-dudes-problem/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us), this bias is reproduced in the algorithm.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.4. Con: The methods through which internet companies censor are not fixed; they are constantly upgraded and improved.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.4.1. Pro: Facebook, Google and Twitter have recently come under fire for how some of their pre-programmed algorithms behave - but vitally, they [altered](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446920/internet-ban-nazis-white-supremacist-hosting-providers-charlottesville) these algorithms immediately, rather than passively allowing things to slip through the net. If companies are committed to censoring harmful views, they will adapt accordingly, as problems present themselves.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.4.2. Pro: In light of Charlottesville, [Twitter](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42402570) altered some of their terms of service to encompass 'hate symbols' as well as suppressing those who 'glorify or condone violence'. As such, several influential white supremacist users and groups have been suspended. As long as companies continue to adapt and develop their censorship rules, they can be relied upon as censors.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.4. Con: Just because something is difficult does not mean that it should not be done. This is only the case if this difficulty causes greater harm than inaction would.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.4.1. Pro: There will always be grey zones in identifying hate speech, but hate speech still needs to be combatted.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.4.2. Pro: By the same logic, governments should stop legislation because their policies will never perfectly address the issues they aim to solve.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.5. Con: Thanks to recent crackdowns on content, users know better how to identify and [report problematic content](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446920/internet-ban-nazis-white-supremacist-hosting-providers-charlottesville). This takes some of the pressure off Internet companies to single-handedly identify problematic content.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.5.1. Con: Passing the burden of identifying correct groups to censor onto the public does not solve the problem. The internal biases of the company get replaced by the biases of the public.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.5.1.1. Con: Society, when it manages to arrive at such a strong and wide reaching consensus, tends to make the correct decision about censoring certain views.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: Germany correctly prevents [holocaust denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial), as it not just flies in the face of history, but is deeply insulting towards all those who survived the holocaust.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: In Germany, it is [illegal](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/8/16/16152088/nazi-swastikas-germany-charlottesville) to use any imagery or make such speech that glorifies or celebrates the WWII Nazi regime.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.5.1.1.3. Pro: Child pornography is [banned or illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography) in most countries around the world because of the kinds of harms children in such pornography have to face.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.5.1.1.4. Con: Many seemingly self-evident truths - such as climate change - are not always subject to broad consensus. A survey in the UK illustrated that only "[11% of the UK](http://www.climatechangenews.com/2014/08/27/uk-public-ignorant-of-climate-science-consensus-poll/) public correctly identify that 'almost all' scientists" know that climate change is factual.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.5.1.2. Pro: Subjecting minority views to approval from the majority is anti-democratic in principle; white supremacism should not need public approval to exist online.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.5.1.3. Con: Not everyone reported by users will be banned by internet companies; this system simply speeds up the process of reviewing potentially harmful material online. The final decision is still in the hands of the internet company.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.6. Con: Companies are doing their best to [be balanced](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446920/internet-ban-nazis-white-supremacist-hosting-providers-charlottesville): 'antifa' \(anti-fascist\) and anarchist content is also being suspended using the same criteria as for their far-right counterparts.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.7. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.4.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4. Con: It is in the economic interest of these platforms to deny service to white supremacists.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.1. Con: Land's End, a primarily Internet-based company, recently exemplified how [politicising can cause damage](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/opinion/op-ed-can-corporations-care): after hosting an interview with a famed pro-choice feminist, they were forced to apologise on Facebook after a backlash from anti-abortion supporters. This, in turn, angered their pro-choice customer base. Land's End found themselves in a lose-lose situation through dabbling in socio-political issues.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.2. Pro: Users who are opposed to white supremacy may abandon platforms that allow it. Fewer users can lead to a [decrease](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-17/facebook-airbnb-go-on-offense-against-neo-nazis-after-violence) in the revenue generated from advertisements, leading to smaller profit margins for internet companies.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.3. Pro: Companies may [refuse](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-17/facebook-airbnb-go-on-offense-against-neo-nazis-after-violence) to advertise on websites which provide a platform to white supremacists, decreasing the number of advertisers they can generate revenue from.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.1. Pro: In 2016, a German grassroots campaign publicly shamed companies who ran advertisement on Breitbart's German website. This led to the website losing advertising deals with [almost 1000 companies](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/breitbart-advertising-activists-campaign-petition-milo-yiannopoulos-a7559441.html).
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.4. Con: By discriminating against their customers based on the content they provide, Internet companies might scare away other customers and will certainly shrink their customer base, so they will lose business either way.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.4.1. Pro: NASCAR's CEO [Brian France](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2016/06/03/why-we-dont-see-more-ceos-endorse-presidential-candidates/?utm_term=.19b09181f052), who had spent a career trying to promote diversity in his business, endorsed Trump's presidency. This sparked a furore with his sponsors and colleagues, and made people question his previous efforts regarding diversity.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.4.2. Con: Being a white supremacist is not a protected characteristic, so declining customers based on it is not discrimination in the eyes of the law.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.4.2.1. Pro: In the US, where most major Internet companies are based, ideology is [not a characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_discrimination_law_in_the_United_States) protected from discrimination.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.4.2.2. Pro: The UK, whose legal system is the basis of a number of common law countries around the world, [does not consider ideology](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/about-discrimination/equality-act-2010-discrimination-and-your-rights/) a protected characteristic.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.4.3. Con: There is no evidence that Cloudflare, Go Daddy or Google lost a financially significant number of users after refusing to provide services to the white supremacist outlet "Daily Stormer".
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.4.4. Pro: Since users will be lost either way, the morally correct thing to do is to not discriminate between political ideologies, and simply provide everyone with an equal platform.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.4.4.1. Con: This assumes that an equal number of users will be lost regardless of which decision internet companies make. This is not true, as there are fewer white supremacists than people who oppose them, as evidenced by the general backlash against the Charlottesville rally.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.5. Pro: An internet company, like any corporation, exists primarily to generate revenue for its employees. If particular customers harm the ability of these companies to generate revenue, then companies have the right to refuse them service.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.6. Con: Denying services to white supremacists limits the customer base of internet companies. While white supremacists only make up a fraction of the population, banning them from internet companies reduces economic output all the same.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.4.4.1.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.7. Con: There is market value in being censorship free when no one else is. The censorship of companies with a large market share and reach creates a demand for censorship free platforms. Recent examples in the social media space are websites like [gab.ai](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/6/16259150/gab-ai-registrar-andrew-anglin-daily-stormer-crackdown) and [minds.com](https://www.minds.com/archive/view/695336719095963651) that are heavily marketed as being censorship-free and pro free speech.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.3. Con: The level of moral responsibility corporations should adhere to is [hugely debatable](http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/news/corporations-moral-status-of).
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: Although corporations may have legal rights, [these are limited](http://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/news/corporations-moral-status-of) as compared to that of the individual - for example, humans have a 'right to life' where corporations do not. This inequity removes any compulsion for corporations to behave with the same moral responsibility as individuals would be expected.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4. Pro: All companies are legally treated under the 14th Amendment as 'persons', and therefore should behave [as individuals](https://www.npr.org/2014/07/28/335288388/when-did-companies-become-people-excavating-the-legal-evolution) would under the same moral parameters.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1. Pro: Individuals have a moral responsibility to not preach the violent and racist views of white supremacists.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.1. Con: It is our moral obligation to allow divergent opinions.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: White supremacist ideas are closely linked to the incitement of violence and promote genocide.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: If a faction of society is becoming violent, silencing and marginalizing them is not a constructive tactic.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.2. Con: Many who are being silenced are suggesting that there is a genocide occurring against them. Their opinion is as valid as anyone else's until proven otherwise through debate, which cannot happen if they are silenced.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.3. Con: Major white supremacist platforms like the Daily Stormer openly advocate for non-violence on their website through prominently placed [disclaimers](https://donotlink.it/Rqnx). They instead seek their solutions through information campaigns.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.3.1. Con: Even with these disclaimers, and guarded language, readers are still radicalized by the constant hate promoted by these sites.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Andrew Anglin, founder of the Daily Stormer has [repeatedly](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/10/us/avalanche-of-hate-daily-stormer-lawsuit/index.html) directly called upon his "Troll Army" to target minority individuals with hate speech and death threats.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.3.2. Pro: Given they clearly advocate non-violence, groups like the Daily Stormer can not be held accountable for the actions of radicals who misinterpret their message.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.3.3. Con: Prominent writers for the Daily Stormer, like Andrew “Weev” Auernheimer, [praise far-right terrorists](http://www.newsweek.com/infamous-neo-nazi-website-finds-safe-space-hong-kong-721963).
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.4. Pro: In November 2017, a white supremacist march in Poland openly called for a "[White Europe](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/12/pray-for-an-islamic-holocaust-tens-of-thousands-from-europes-far-right-march-in-poland/)".
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.4.1. Con: Europeans are white, they deserve a homeland on their native continent.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.4.1.1. Con: White Europeans already have citizenship rights in European nation-states and therefore multiple homelands on their native continent.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.4.1.2. Con: The modern history of Europe and Africa is overwhelmingly saturated with Europeans forcibly deporting Africans into European states as [slaves.](http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/black-history-europe-short-story) Having lived in these lands for generations, they can rightfully claim that Europe is their homeland too.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro: Most contemporary historians think that between 9 and 11 million people were taken out of Africa by [European slave traders](http://discoveringbristol.org.uk/slavery/routes/from-africa-to-america/atlantic-crossing/people-taken-from-africa/). These people were denied the right to form nations in their homelands and have lived in Europe for centuries.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.4.1.3. Pro: At the current rates of procreation and immigration, Europe will cease to be a predominantly white, Christian continent [by 2150](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2008/02/27/white-europeans-an-endangered-species/).
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.4.1.3.1. Con: This fact, taken by itself, does not mean that whites would no longer have a home, and does not justify racist ideologies. To treat this as a supporting argument for the claim it supports presupposes that this would be a problematic situation.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.4.1.3.2. Pro: [Reduced](http://news.gallup.com/poll/13117/Religion-Europe-Trust-Filling-Pews.aspx) [levels](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/02/7-key-changes-in-the-global-religious-landscape/) of [religiosity](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/15/europe-projected-to-retain-its-christian-majority-but-religious-minorities-will-grow/) within [western](http://www.vexen.co.uk/UK/religion.html#CensusResults) countries likely means that at some point many countries within Europe will no longer be predominately Christian.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.4.1.4. Con: Europeans are majority white but the non-white European minority is growing. They have equal claim to their homeland on their native continent.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.5. Con: Restricting speech advocating violence can be used in the long run to justify [silencing political dissent](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/why-we-must-still-defend-free-speech/).
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.6. Pro: According to a [US Supreme Court ruling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio) from 1969, the First Amendment does not protect incitements to imminent lawless action such as violence.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.6.1. Con: Promoting white supremacist ideology online generally does not meet the narrow definition of inciting imminent lawless action. For example: "Whites are the superior race" - does not incite imminent violence. Compared to: "Let's meet up on Saturday and beat up some minorities" - does incite imminent violence.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.7. Pro: Given the nature of its beliefs, to the extent that white supremacy intends or causes harm to others, to that extent its expression should be denied.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.9. Pro: [White supremacist extremists](http://www.newsweek.com/white-supremacists-islamist-extremism-charlottesville-trump-654665) were responsible for more domestic terror attacks between 2000-2016 than any other group.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.5. Pro: A refusal to condemn or reject morally unsound viewpoints, such as white supremacism, can be read as a tacit agreement.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.5.1. Con: Tacit agreement can only exist in situations where the absence of an individual's active dissent is in some way consequential. For example, you can't tacitly agree with a viewpoint that you are unaware of.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.6. Con: Both white supremacism and censorship are immoral and easily discredited. We need not indulge in one to reject the other.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.6.1. Con: This is a false equivalency between a domestic terrorist organization and a media company selectively publishing content. Clearly one is more condemnable than the other.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.4. Pro: Since they simply provide a privately-owned forum, Internet companies have no obligation to provide a platform to everyone.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: While the state has an obligation towards all citizens, private companies are only responsible to their owners and shareholders.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Every person has a right to decide who they want to listen to, and whose ideas they want to present to other people. Companies are collections of people \(workers, owners, customers\) and can collectively decide to not use their platform to help some people/ideas. Only when violence in the form of the state is used to prevent those ideas from being expressed anywhere is a moral threshold crossed. This is analogous to a group kicking out a member for being annoying.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.5. Pro: Internet companies, like all others, usually have a mission statement or a code of values that tells potential customers or investors what they believe in. If White Supremacists go against these values, then they have the right to take down their speech and deny them service.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Google publicly said that the Neo Nazi site The Daily Stormer,[violated its terms of service](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/15/tech-companies-block-neo-nazi-groups-charlottesville-rally/), and also blocked its YouTube channel.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.5.2. Pro: Facebook's [moderation rules](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/15/tech-companies-block-neo-nazi-groups-charlottesville-rally/) aim to protect all users from discrimination based on immutable characteristics. Since White Supremacist speech enables such discrimination, they have a right to deny service to those individuals.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.5.3. Pro: Internet companies deny service to people with many diverse ideologies for breaking terms of service, denying service to white supremacists should be no different.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.6. Con: One does not have an absolute right to use one's property in any given way. No constitution guarantees this.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.6.1. Con: Nobody has more rights to use property in whichever way than the owner - including discontinuation of service to all or some users.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.7. Con: It's debatable if they own their platforms, the multimedia lanes are open to all in theory, at least while [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality) is kept. This means the companies are basically using public space to broadcast on.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8. Pro: Users of any website have consented to that website's terms of service, which specify conditions such as a ban on hate speech. By extension, users have consented to not posting content violating those guidelines, and to being punished if they do.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.1. Con: Even though companies such as [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/) were acting within their contractual rights, they were at pains to qualify their decision, as they feared negative effects to freedom of speech if internet companies were given free reign to censor.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.1.1. Pro: The decision to censor by Cloudflare was [arbitrary](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/cloudflare-ceo-the-people-behind-the-daily-stormer-are-assholes/). By the CEO's own admission, he 'woke up one morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the internet'. This has nothing to do with contractual rights or obligations, but rather was an impulsive action.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.1.1.1. Con: If those kicked out believe that they were banned on unfair, arbitrary and not contractual grounds, they should have the ability to appeal this decision. This still does not mean that white supremacists should not be banned.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.1.2. Pro: As the CEO of Cloudflare said, it will now be a 'little bit [harder](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/) for us to argue against a government somewhere pressuring us into taking down a site they don't like'.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.2. Pro: Clubs can refuse entry to non-members, they can refuse membership on failure to qualify, they can suspend membership on violation of terms, what they can't do is hold non-members to terms.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.3. Con: The issue here is that there can be no legal objective definition of "hate speech". There must be an objective and balanced definition of hate speech if it is to be used in any contractual context.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.4. Pro: GoDaddy, Google, and presumably other internet companies from which The Daily Stormer and other white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups were terminated acted within their [contractual rights.](https://verdict.justia.com/2017/08/23/free-speech-issues-raised-internet-companies-denying-service-neo-nazi-sites)
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.4.1. Pro: Under the GoDaddy [Terms of Service](https://pk.godaddy.com/agreements/showdoc.aspx?pageid=REG_SA), GoDaddy has the power to terminate a domain registration based on the user’s “morally objectionable activities,” including “\[a\]ctivities designed to encourage unlawful behavior by others, such as hate crimes.”
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.4.1.1. Con: Despite this, GoDaddy is still hosting [altright.com](http://altright.com/) and a [number of other](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/17/16163960/hate-groups-banned-godaddy-cloudflare-facebook-squarespace) white supremacist sites, which contravene their terms of service in the same way as The Daily Stormer. GoDaddy's failure to act calls the validity of their censorship choices into question.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.4.2. Pro: Google’s [Terms of Service](https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/get_legal_document?ldo=16267419166080200835&ldt=domainstos&ldr=ZZ&ldl=und) document does not directly bar hate speech, but it reserves to Google the right to terminate domain registrations for violations of Google policies.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2. Con: White supremacists have a fundamental right to organize rallies and protests and attract attention peaceably.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.1. Con: As the Charlottesville rally indicated, white supremacist rallies are [more violent than peaceful](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/12/16138246/charlottesville-nazi-rally-right-uva).
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.2. Con: White supremacist rallies are [attended](https://www.vox.com/2017/8/12/16138246/charlottesville-nazi-rally-right-uva) by members of the Ku Klux Klan, the militia movement \(a right-wing movement that gained traction in the 1990s, whose members include the activists who took over a federal nature reserve in early 2016\) and the Alt-Knights, an alt-right “fight club”. These are not peaceful protestors.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3. Con: Certain ideas are fundamentally undemocratic and must be censored to protect a democracy.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Speech can in and of itself be harmful. Such speech should be banned in order to protect those affected.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Constantly being told that they are inferior can negatively impact people's [physical and mental health](http://news.berkeley.edu/berkeley_blog/what-is-hate-speech/), such as causing toxic stress or a feeling of constant fear and mistrust.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Giving one’s students a lot of homework can [do the same.](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/?utm_source=atlfb) Both practices can cause prolonged stress to others, but that does not turn them into forms of violence.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Such harmful effects only occur with [prolonged exposure](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/?utm_source=atlfb) to such speech.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: People from minority communities can easily choose to overlook such speech on the internet. This effectively means that they are usually not exposed to such speech for a long period of time.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: Even if this premise was accepted, it merely leads to the conclusion that internet companies should not allow continuous use of such speech, not ban such speech altogether.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: Many minorities suffer from "[minority trauma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747726/)", a kind of anxiety incited by [repeated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446201/pdf/10754972.pdf) challenges to their identity that culminates as trauma and is associated with symptoms of PTSD.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.2. Con: The fact that speech can cause harm does not mean that it necessarily does. Whether harm has been caused to an individual, and if yes, to what degree, is entirely subjective.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.3. Con: This is a slippery slope. If we ban one form of speech, there is nothing but interpretation to prevent other forms from being banned.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.3.1. Pro: Anyone can judge words to be harmful if they don't agree to what is said; a child could claim a mother or teacher's speech is harmful to their right of free thought.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.3.2. Con: This is the argument most often used by extremist groups, such as white supremacists. Rather than stating their ideals outright, they claim their _right_ to express their ideals is being suppressed. This places more liberal people in a moral dilemma, all the while not having anything concrete from the white supremacists that can be responded to.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.2. Con: If they are excluded entirely from democratic discourse, white supremacists are likely to lose all respect for the political system and [attack it](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/8/16/16153248/free-speech-nazi-first-amendment-democracy-hate-speech) more passionately. In the long run, this creates new threats for democracy rather than protect it.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: As long as they are part of the democratic process and have a chance of gaining power through it, white supremacists have an interest in maintaining it. Once they are excluded, they have nothing to lose.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: If they are excluded from the democratic process, white supremacists might believe that the laws decided through that democratic process [no longer apply](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/8/16/16153248/free-speech-nazi-first-amendment-democracy-hate-speech) to them.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.3. Pro: Democracy requires a reasonably peaceful society, which is based on treating individuals with dignity and fairness. Hateful white supremacist speech undermines this social harmony and thus democracy.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.3.1. Pro: The aim of democratic discourse is to resolve conflicts through peaceful debate instead of violence. This is only possible if people have a degree of personal safety.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.3.2. Pro: Democracy is fundamentally based on the idea that every individual \(and their vote\) counts equally. This presupposes that all of them be treated equally and with the dignity that every human being deserves.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4. Con: Millions of ordinary individuals [hold white supremacist beliefs](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/18/us/ordinary-white-supremacists/index.html), even if they don't have a penchant for violence. Violating the freedom of speech of such a large group is undemocratic in and of itself.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.1. Pro: White supremacists are condemned because they openly proclaim not to believe in integration or racial equality, yet almost a fifth of Europeans [wouldn't](http://www.euronews.com/2017/08/25/almost-a-fifth-of-europeans-wouldnt-want-to-live-next-door-to-a-muslim) want to live next door to a Muslim, and a majority of white Americans are [self-segregating](https://www.vox.com/2017/1/18/14296126/white-segregated-suburb-neighborhood-cartoon) from racially diverse communities.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.1.1. Pro: Around 1 in 6 Americans, or 16 percent, [strongly or somewhat agreed](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reuters-poll-white-supremacist-views_us_59bc155fe4b02da0e141b3c8) that “marriage should only be allowed between people of the same race.”
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.2. Pro: In states such as Virginia, the belief that Confederate history, and celebration of those who championed slavery, is a point of cultural pride is a [mainstream](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/8/18/16145476/charlottesville-protest-white-supremacy) one.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.3. Con: The number of people who believe in a certain speech is irrelevant; what matters is the content of the speech, and if it is tantamount to [hate speech](https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/theres-no-common-ground-with-white-supremacists/), then it should be censored.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.3.1. Con: There is no collective public entity that can apply censorship exactly according to the will of the people. We will always assign someone the responsibility, and there is nobody that we can trust to be an objective censor.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.3.1.1. Pro: As long as censorship is conducted by humans, it is prone to the same [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) that they are subject to.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.3.1.1.1. Con: If the only negative consequences of censorship are the effects of inherent human biases that already pervade all of public policy, this is an acceptable consequence, because otherwise censorship would never be legitimate. However, sometimes, as is the case in this instance, censorship is necessary to protect people.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.3.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.3.1.3. Con: No policy process will be perfect. If the only negative consequences of censorship are the effects of inherent human biases that already pervade all of public policy, this is an acceptable consequence.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.3.1.4. Pro: Falsely accusing someone of being a white supremacist could become an effective way for malicious actors to shut down someone's Internet presence.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.3.1.4.1. Pro: This goes further if we accept the premise that all supremacists must be shut down. Any opponent can simply declare a group "supremacist" as a means of shutting them down.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.3.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.1.1.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.4. Con: There is no evidence that "millions of ordinary individuals" are white supremacists, and it is not clear how one would go about establishing such a claim.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.4.1. Con: 9% of Americans - 30 million people - believe that it is [okay to hold](https://www.axios.com/9-of-americans-think-its-ok-to-hold-white-supremacist-or-neo-nazi-views-poll-1513304986-f806ae4d-41f7-4095-a4e6-a071168d4876.html) white supremacist or neo-nazi beliefs. To think that a belief in the superiority of the white race is an acceptable one is evidence of the prevalence of white supremacy itself.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.4.2. Con: 31 percent of Americans [polled strongly or somewhat agreed](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reuters-poll-white-supremacist-views_us_59bc155fe4b02da0e141b3c8) that “America must protect and preserve its White European heritage,” and 39 percent agreed that “white people are currently under attack in this country,” beliefs that are at the core of white supremacist ideology.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.4.2.1. Con: A widely believed falsehood is still a falsehood.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.4.2.1.1. Con: It is not a falsehood to believe that 'America must protect and preserve its White European heritage'; it is an opinion, and not one that necessarily discriminates against other groups.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.4.2.1.2. Con: The point is not that this belief is a falsehood, but that it is believed by millions of Americans. To censor such views is to reinforce these 'truths', and serves only to victimise those who consider themselves to be oppressed even further.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.4.3. Con: 8% of Americans claimed to [support](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/reuters-poll-white-supremacist-views_us_59bc155fe4b02da0e141b3c8) white nationalism as a group or a movement.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.4.4. Con: 11% of Americans [do not think](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/reuters-poll-white-supremacist-views_us_59bc155fe4b02da0e141b3c8) that all races should be treated equally, a clear indication in the belief of some races being superior to others.

1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.8. Con: Internet companies have no obligation to be democratic.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.9. Con: Internet companies have no obligation to reflect any particular view \("mainstream" or otherwise\).
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.10. Con: Speech can be regulated \(just like behaviours, trade, etc.\) because democracy is about the way citizens exercise power in order to keep the majority safe and to promote their well-being.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.11. Pro: It is telling that the [various sites](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446920/internet-ban-nazis-white-supremacist-hosting-providers-charlottesville) that have sprung up for banned users to relocate to - including alternatives to reddit, Twitter, GoFundMe and YouTube - all advertise themselves as being places for 'free speech'. Evidently, a large number of censored users feel disenfranchised and restricted; this is deeply undemocratic.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.5. Pro: White supremacism's promotion of inequality based on race runs counter to a fundamental pillar of democracy: equality.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.5.1. Pro: White supremacist speech and related hate speech often involve [explicitly telling](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/hate-speech-offensive-should-illegal) members of minority groups that they are inferior.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.6. Pro: The only appropriate response to intolerance is to not tolerate it. This seems inconsistent, but it really isn't. The only way to combat intolerance and hate is to make sure it does not take root by establishing a no tolerance view. So, no, hate should not be free to spread.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.6.1. Con: The only way to combat intolerance and hate is to attack it at the roots. This can only be accomplished by speech. Banning ideas does not make them go away. Talking about them can.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.6.2. Con: There are many ways to respond to intolerance, ranging from excluding intolerant people to avoiding them to engaging with them and promoting change.  There is no reason to think that suppressing intolerant people is the best way to address the problem.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.6.2.1. Con: There is no reason to assume that the intolerant cannot have their incorrect ideas suppressed on the internet while at the same time society works on helping them out of their incorrect ideas.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.6.3. Pro: This is essentially a restatement of [Popper's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance), which states that any system that is 100% tolerant of everything will eventually be destroyed by intolerant people, since that wholly tolerant system cannot act agains the intolerant by definition.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.7. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.1.1.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.8. Con: Denying free speech to a person is undemocratic, even if that person promotes undemocratic ideas.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.8.1. Con: Democracy is built on the right to express. If your expression takes the rights away from anyone inside this democracy, you by definition are acting undemocratically. Blocking "any type" of extremists is required for the healthy functioning of a democracy. The system needs to protect itself.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.9. Con: Many ideas and practices are "fundamentally undemocratic" in the sense that they attack or undermine support for democracy. These ideas and practices include direct attacks on democracy as a system, one-party Communism, and viewpoint censorship. One can justify denying service to white supremacists on grounds of undermining democracy only if one is prepared to do so to these other views.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.10. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.3.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.11. Pro: The intimidation resulting from white supremacist speech can keep minorities from voting.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.11.1. Pro: Given [widespread efforts](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/10/trump-election-intimidation-minority-voters/504059/) to suppress minority voters in the US, white supremacist speech online can contribute to a general atmosphere of intimidation deliberately aimed at keeping communities of colour from voting.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.11.2. Pro: During the 2016 US presidential elections, the Internet was used to spread specific calls for "[volunteer election observers](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-volunteer-election-observers-voter-intimidation)", aimed at keeping communities of colour from voting.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.11.3. Pro: Hate speech, by instilling fear, actively makes people [withdraw](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/solveig-horne/hate-speech--a-threat-to_b_9406596.html) from public spaces, shutting down their voices and preventing important views from being heard. Speech, on its own, can silence others, but should not be allowed to do so.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.11.4. Pro: The [Turner Diaries](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/turner-diaries?xpicked=5), probably the most widely read book amongst white supremacists, is a fictional account of a white supremacist guerrilla army which lynch 'race traitors' \(those who interact with non-whites\) and people of colour. Such speech clearly creates fear amongst people of colour. This work has been [linked](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/turner-diaries?xpicked=5) to multiple white supremacist terrorist groups, and thus used to provoke fear
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.11.5. Pro: Neo-Nazi demonstrations for example, may frighten local Jewish communities and prevent them from actively participating in public life.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.11.6. Con: Censorship is equivalent to publicly denouncing an ideology, and declaring it to be unworthy of being in a public space. This is no less intimidating for those who believe in some form of white supremacism, even the milder versions of the ideology. It is not moral to intimidate one group in the defence of another.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12. Pro: Speech that incites violence is fundamentally undemocratic and must be censored to protect democracy.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.3.1.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.2. Con: Not all "white supremacist" speech incites violence. If it does amount to a credible threat, it ought to be investigated. If it does not - for instance, saying "I hate black people" - it in no way amounts to a crime.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.2.1. Con: White supremacist speech does not need to constitute a credible threat in order to intimidate members of ethnic or religious minorities. While this intimidation may not be a crime under current legislation, it should still be prevented.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.11.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5. Pro: Historically, white supremacist speech is aimed at instilling fear in vulnerable people rather than constructive debate.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.1. Pro: There is no evidence that white supremacists are interested in mutually beneficial debate, or are willing to modify their own views in response to criticism.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.2. Pro: Some white supremacists [advocate genocide and ethnic cleansing](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/13/us/white-nationalism-explainer-trnd/index.html). The aim of such speech is to actively eliminate non-whites, preventing people of colour from living their lives peacefully.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.3. Pro: Such speech is particularly dangerous when it actively inspires violent acts.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.3.1. Pro: White supremacists often use [torches](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drsarahbond/2017/08/15/a-short-history-of-torches-and-intimidation/#91303c367629) at their rallies, a symbol of racial superiority, historically used by the Klu Klux Klan to intimidate African Americans. Their use today serves the same purpose, to instil fear in people of colour.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.3.2. Pro: Since 2001, the number of [violent attacks](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/u-s-sees-300-violent-attacks-inspired-far-right-every-year) on U.S. soil inspired by far-right ideology \(groups including white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups and anti-federalists militias\) has spiked to an average of more than 300 a year.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.3.3. Pro: People with ties to the far right were [responsible](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/13/us/white-nationalism-explainer-trnd/index.html) for 74% of homicides by extremists in the US between 2007 to 2016.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.3.4. Pro: White supremacists tried to crowdsource funds for the legal defence of James Fields, the man who murdered a woman by driving his car into counter-protestors during the Charlottesville rally. Such groups [actively defend](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-protests-crowdfunding/no-cash-for-hate-say-mainstream-crowdfunding-firms-idUSKCN1AU2HE) those who committed murder in their name.

1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.11.3.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.4. Pro: The American Civil Liberties Union \(ACLU\) [defends](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/12/16138326/aclu-charlottesville-protests-racism) the right of white supremacists to protest and speak out, as free speech rights must be universal. Society can disagree with the views of white supremacists but nonetheless support their right to say it.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.3. Con: The white nationalist rally in Charlottesville was not formally designed, nor organised, to be violent. Despite the proclivity of some members to engage in violence, most white supremacist rallies are not intended to be violent and removing the group's ability to organise peaceful protests or rallies is unreasonable.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.4. Pro: [Phone app Discord](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/charlottesville-latest-discord-chat-app-bans-white-supremacists-nationalists-alt-right-neo-nazis-a7896601.html) was found to be one of the fundamental elements in organising the Charlottesville rally. Without this app - the core of white supremacist private communication - it will be considerably harder to organise anything of that ilk again.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.2. Pro: This effectively means that white supremacist groups are less likely to frighten and bully users online who belong to minority communities.
1.2.1.5.2.5.6.3. Pro: Hosting their ideas on easily accessible prominent websites makes it easy for white supremacists to spread them and recruit new followers, thus increasing their overall number.
1.2.1.5.2.5.7. Pro: White supremacists can target and threaten specific individuals online. Denying them service on widely accessible social media platforms would make such attacks more difficult.

1.2.1.5.2.6. Con: Speech, in the absence of action, is not an active threat to anyone, no matter how aggressive it may be.
1.2.1.5.2.6.1. Con: A threat need not be active to be harmful, depending on the level of influence held by those expressing it. When a president or other head of state expresses ideas of white supremacy, it can influence others to act.
1.2.1.5.2.6.1.1. Con: That would not be an example of speech without action. The person influenced to act is now acting, and would be the person responsible for their actions.
1.2.1.5.2.6.2. Pro: It is easy to avoid interacting with white supremacists online: do not visit their websites, or interact with followers of the ideology on social media. Censorship is an unnecessary step to take.
1.2.1.5.2.6.2.1. Con: One main danger from white supremacists using online platforms is that it allows them to organise and spread their propaganda, thus endangering people of colour and religious minorities in real life.

1.2.1.5.2.7. Pro: Especially under conditions of social inequality, voices attacking groups that are already discriminated against should not be amplified further.
1.2.1.5.2.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.1.1.
1.2.1.5.2.7.2. Pro: Religious, ethnic and racial minorities already face substantial hurdles in access to public infrastructure and resources compared to their white counterparts, even in the developed world.
1.2.1.5.2.7.3. Pro: The “[marketplace of ideas](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/why-we-must-still-defend-free-speech/)” assumes a mythical level playing field. If some speakers drown out or silence others, the marketplace cannot function in the interests of all.
1.2.1.5.2.7.3.1. Con: Even if the playing field is not "level", any attempt to "fix" it by an imperfect actor would make it even less level and end up favoring one group above another. That would inherently involve favoring some ideas over others, power that can very easily lead to one ideology abusing that power.
1.2.1.5.2.7.3.1.1. Con: Given that there never will be a perfect government or people, this leads to the conclusion that nothing should ever be done to try to level the playing field. This is problematic because an imbalanced playing field leads to discrimination of certain groups.
1.2.1.5.2.7.3.1.2. Con: This relies on the assumption that all ideologies are equally important and that the government favoring one ideology over another is actually a bad thing. Some ideologies are so harmful that they do not deserve government favor to begin with.
1.2.1.5.2.7.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.
1.2.1.5.2.7.3.2. Con: The right to free speech does not rest on the presumption of a level playing field. Virtually all rights, speech included, are enjoyed unequally, and can reinforce inequality. The fundamental right to choose how to educate one’s children means little to parents who cannot afford private schools, and contributes to the resilience of segregated schools and the reproduction of privilege.
1.2.1.5.2.8. Pro: White supremacist speech can intimidate members of social minorities and inspire in them a feeling of fear, making them feel unwelcome in their home country.
1.2.1.5.2.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.4.
1.2.1.5.2.8.2. Pro: Brexit - which has been repeatedly connected with racism and/or white supremacy - saw a [41% increase in hate crimes](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/brexit-hate-crimes-racism-eu-referendum-vote-attacks-increase-police-figures-official-a7358866.html) within a single month after it was voted in.

1.2.1.5.2.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.
1.2.1.5.2.11.3. Con: Being exposed to contrary opinions is not unsafe.
1.2.1.5.2.11.4. Pro: The Internet is not necessarily expected to be 'safe': however, it is essential to [foster public confidence](http://www.thegreatdebate.org.uk/GDIntFreeProc.html) in the Internet by monitoring and tackling criminal content in a way that is obvious to users. Denying services to white supremacists falls under this remit.
1.2.1.5.2.11.4.1. Con: Ideas, absent actions, can never be criminalized in a free society.
1.2.1.5.2.11.4.1.1. Con: If ideas run the risk of inciting violence, or causing people harm in society, then they can be criminalised.
1.2.1.5.2.11.4.1.2. Con: Freedom is not bound to actions, and ideas are what motivates people to act, so they have to be regulated.
1.2.1.5.2.11.5. Con: Preventing free speech is not helpful in combating racism, or indeed white supremacist viewpoints; rather, it can prove [detrimental](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/race-and-the-anti-free-speech-diversion/415254/).
1.2.1.5.2.11.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.1.1.
1.2.1.5.2.11.5.2. Pro: Suppressing fair and open conversation prevents both sides from expressing their viewpoints adequately, and prevents potentially helpful arguments from being discussed.
1.2.1.5.2.11.5.3. Pro: Speech codes do not necessarily help persecuted groups. For example, an American university enforced a speech code to restrict racist remarks, which [backfired](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/race-and-the-anti-free-speech-diversion/415254/): racist incidents continued at the same rate, and minority students were reported under the code for small infractions like the phrase 'white trash'. The speech code was lifted eighteen months later, as administrators acknowledged the lack of a positive effect.
1.2.1.5.2.11.6. Con: If you do not debate bad ideas then people never learn, which makes the world more unsafe.
1.2.1.5.2.11.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.1.
1.2.1.5.2.11.6.2. Con: White supremacist ideals can not be subject to rational scrutiny because they are not grounded in any rational principle to begin with.
1.2.1.5.2.11.6.3. Con: Even if white supremacists were willing to debate and compromise, said compromise would necessarily harm minority communities.
1.2.1.5.2.11.6.3.1. Pro: Compromise only occurs when both sides agree to give up and agree to certain issues. Agreement on certain white supremacist policies or principles, necessarily and by definition harms minority groups.
1.2.1.5.2.11.6.3.1.1. Pro: By definition, white supremacists want more power for white people. Any concession to these demands would mean taking power away from communities of color.
1.2.1.5.2.11.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.1.
1.2.1.5.2.11.8. Pro: It has broader impact than simply the Internet platform users: white supremacists [gather funds](https://www.theroot.com/nobloodmoney-new-campaign-targets-credit-card-compani-1797900769) online. If they are denied service, their hate rallies and actions become harder to finance.
1.2.1.5.2.11.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.3.4.
1.2.1.5.2.11.8.2. Pro: The Daily Stormer needs financing to run. Since "[PayPal \(and everything else known to man\)](https://dailystormer.red/contributions/)" has banned them, they are restricted to Bitcoin and cash. Now that its founder Andrew [Anglin is being sued](https://www.splcenter.org/news/2017/04/18/splc-sues-neo-nazi-leader-who-targeted-jewish-woman-anti-semitic-harassment-campaign), their need for money [is desperate](https://dailystormer.red/splc-is-suing-anglin-donate-now-to-hold-back-the-night/), but much harder for their followers to meet.
1.2.1.5.2.12. Pro: As white supremacism is inevitably an abuse of power against non-white people, it is okay to deny service to white supremacists.
1.2.1.5.2.12.1. Pro: White supremacism calls for white people to have more power relative to others, but there is no scientific evidence that skin color is a predictor of intelligence, leadership, morality, strength or any other skill needed to rule in the collective interest.
1.2.1.5.2.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.
1.2.1.5.2.13. Pro: White supremacy is not exclusively found in the USA, although the bulk of media attention is currently focused there. The international reach of white supremacy - especially in Europe and [the UK](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/far-right-uk-identitarian-movement-alt-right-defend-europe-isd-research-nazis-national-action-a8013331.html) - is another reason to censor potential instigators before their ideas gain further traction.
1.2.1.5.2.14. Con: Allowing white supremacists a voice allows them to air dangerous viewpoints anonymously in a virtual forum rather than the 'real world'. While it is still possible to be verbally toxic, it is impossible to physically attack others online.
1.2.1.5.3. Con: Not all speech used by white supremacists directly incites or threatens violence. While it may be true that hate speech can and should be censored, it is unclear why other forms of speech that do not threaten the safety of other people should not.
1.2.2. Con: Moral consistency is irrelevant in this case. When a group, any group, advocates for the extermination of another group for arbitrary reasons they give up any right to free speech. It then becomes intimidation and threats against persons/groups.
1.2.3. Con: White supremacists directly target people of colour and religious minorities, those who are often already oppressed within society, while far left violence is inspired by the need to tackle the violence that stems from white supremacy. The two are not morally equivalent.
1.2.3.1. Pro: The overwhelming amount of [political violence](https://www.thenation.com/article/why-does-the-far-right-hold-a-near-monopoly-on-political-violence/) in the US since the 1960s has come from the far right. As of 2015, police rated them a bigger threat than Islamic extremists.
1.2.3.2. Con: It is immoral to reduce lives lost to numbers, since every life lost is one too many. Any political ideology that leads to innocent people being killed should be treated the same.
1.2.3.3. Con: These statistics may be due to [media and research biases](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/450498/domestic-terror-threats-how-media-misleads-public). Left-wing extremism is often minimised or ignored in favour of popularising the idea of violence being exclusively germane to either jihadist or right-wing groups.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: A [Governmental Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/683984.pdf) study, which tried to claim that white supremacists were responsible for the overwhelming majority of terrorist attacks, [omits to mention](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/450498/domestic-terror-threats-how-media-misleads-public) a number of left-wing attacks
1.2.3.3.1.1. Con: When categorising political violence, a certain margin of error is inevitable. The mere fact that such errors occur doesn't prove that statistics are systematically biased against the right - rather, it would need to be shown that over-attribution happens more often on the right than on the left.
1.2.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: The process of classifying violent incidents usually happens through police officials or bureaucrats ticking a particular box or not, which makes human error a likely occurrence.
1.2.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.1.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: The source cited exhibits its own bias, e.g. by denying that an attack committed by a [man collecting Nazi](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/oregon-shooting-shooter-chris-harper-mercer-was-reclusive-26-year-old-with-an-interest-in-ira-and-a6677696.html) memorabilia could be classified as white supremacist simply because the perpetrator was mixed-race. It is thus unclear how reliable its classifications of politically motivated crimes are.
1.2.3.3.2.1. Con: It is [not just his race](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/us/chris-harper-mercer-umpqua-community-college-shooting.html?_r=0) that calls his supposed white supremacism into question. The act of collecting Nazi memorabilia does not instantly make a mass murderer a white supremacist. Rather, Harper-Mercer was preoccupied with firearms, was predominantly an IRA sympathiser, and was fascinated by mass shootings: it is reductive, assumptive, and evident of a media bias to label him a white supremacist, and indeed use that as a supposed reason for his actions.
1.2.3.3.3. Pro: Many attacks have been wrongly or questionably ascribed to certain political groups. There are a number of '[right-wing attacks](http://markhumphrys.com/left.right.violence.html)' that have been labelled as such, despite the perpetrators not necessarily being so. Inflated statistics of 'right-wing' attacks then skew public opinion unfairly.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Con: This may be partially due to the difficulties in adequately defining what constitutes 'right-wing', particularly as different media or research figures are likely to have different definitions.
1.2.3.3.3.2. Pro: This also prevents people from identifying risks from different groups correctly, which could have serious social repercussions.
1.2.3.3.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.1.
1.2.3.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.1.1.
1.2.3.4. Con: Such assertions fail to take into account the large degree of violence perpetrated by far-left sympathisers.
1.2.3.4.1. Pro: Far-left sympathisers have committed [arson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/02/black-bloc-protests-return-for-trump-era-leaving-flames-broken-windows-from-dc-to-berkeley/?utm_term=.acaac8d6c9f3), [criminal damage](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/tn-dpt-me-rally-arrests-20160607-story.html), [torture](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/04/facebook-live-stream-video-man-attacked-chicago-trump), [assault](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/protesters-assault-trump-supporters-eggs-bottles-punches-after-rally-n585096), and a host of other politically motivated attacks.
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: [Antifa](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448275/antifa-protest-movement-roots-left-wing-political-violence) have been responsible for riots, arson, threatening behaviour and active violence. However, there is no current indication that any platform has any intention of suspending Antifa members or sympathisers.
1.2.3.5. Pro: White supremacists effectively and consistently try to and succeed in killing people, which the far left rarely does.
1.2.3.5.1. Pro: Right-wing extremists have killed [between 75 and 180](https://www.mut-gegen-rechte-gewalt.de/news/chronik-der-gewalt/todesopfer-rechtsextremer-und-rassistischer-gewalt-seit-1990) people in Germany since 1990, while there were [no deaths](https://www.bpb.de/apuz/32414/gewalthandeln-linker-und-rechter-militanter-szenen?p=all) caused by left-wing violence.
1.2.3.5.1.1. Pro: These numbers are likely higher rather than lower, since even events that a reasonable average person would classify as a right-wing hate crime are [often not officially classified](http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2015-06/rechte-gewalt-todesopfer-zahlen-brandenburg/komplettansicht) as such in Germany.
1.2.3.5.2. Pro: According to the Anti-Defamation League's [Center on Extremism](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/16/533255619/fact-check-is-left-wing-violence-rising), right-wing extremists were responsible for 74% of murders committed by domestic extremists in the US since 1997.
1.2.3.5.3. Pro: According to a [2017 analysis](https://www.cato.org/blog/terrorism-deaths-ideology-charlottesville-anomaly) by the libertarian Cato Institute, right-wing terrorists in the US killed ten times as many people as left-wing extremists between 1992 and 2017.
1.2.3.5.4. Con: A large proportion of hate crime goes [underreported](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/05/health/hate-crimes-tracking-history-fbi/index.html) in the USA: when national statistics are being determined by the FBI, states will often minimise their statistics, or have failures in documenting hate crimes. As such, it is almost impossible to get an accurate picture of hate crimes, let alone which groups are responsible.
1.2.3.5.4.1. Con: Statistical reporting errors are likely to affect crimes across the political spectrum equally, so the proportion of a much higher rate of hate crime from the far right is likely to be representative.
1.2.3.5.4.2. Con: There is no evidence of significant amounts of far-left hate crime being suppressed from government statistics.
1.2.3.5.4.3. Con: Reporting errors are likely to primarily lead to significant numbers of far-right hate crime being underreported.
1.2.3.5.4.3.1. Pro: Ethnic minorities, who are likely affected by far right crime, are less likely to trust the police and report crimes to them.
1.2.3.5.4.3.1.1. Pro: Many women of colour in the US [mistrust](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/25/women-of-color-police-sexual-assault-racist-criminal-justice) the police and the judicial system and thus refrain from reporting sexual assault.
1.2.3.5.4.3.1.2. Pro: Due to a string of police shootings and racist policing, the African-American community in particular [has lost all trust](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/letter-from-black-america-police-115545) in the police.
1.2.3.5.4.3.2. Pro: The police are less likely to believe ethnic minorities who report racist hate crimes.
1.2.3.5.4.3.3. Pro: Left-wing crimes such as property destruction tend to affect people who are relatively well-off, established in society and have little reason to mistrust the police, so these crimes are more likely to be reported.
1.2.4. Pro: It is unfair to treat similar ideologies differently. By doing so, one ideology is unfairly allowed to thrive while another is censored, despite both being equally harmful.
1.2.4.1. Con: In the context of this discussion we are not talking about similar ideologies. White Supremacy fosters, and often preaches, hate against those of a different skin colour.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.6.
1.2.5. Pro: The hard-left currently pose a [serious threat](https://www.dailynews.com/2017/05/30/blame-goes-left-and-right-for-hate-crimes-political-violence/) to free speech, by virtue of often violently 'no platforming' controversial speakers. Internet companies should not be facilitating the whims of one side of the political spectrum over another.
1.2.5.1. Con: White supremacism is not aligned with any side of the political spectrum.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Modern left-leaning poltics is primarily driven by liberal ideals. These ideals are grounded in the fact that everybody should be treated equally, and are therefore incompatible with an ideology like white supremacism, where the core concept is superiority of one group of people based solely on skin colour. For this reason, \(almost?\) all white supremacist movements are right- or far-right wing.
1.2.6. Con: White supremacism is unique in that it dehumanises people because of their innate characteristics as part of its core ideology. As such, it is not comparable to any other widespread ideologies.
1.2.6.1. Con: It is not unique at all. There are prominent ‘reverse’ racism groups, such as the [New Black Panther Party](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/new-black-panther-party) in the US, who discriminate primarily against Caucasian and Jewish people.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: While the exact membership size of the NBPP is disputed, it has a few thousand members according to itself \(but likely [much less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Black_Panther_Party#Membership_size)\) and can by no means be considered "widespread".
1.2.6.1.2. Con: The fact that there are other groups than White supremacists that might not like this, does not negate the claim that the move is morally consistent. This discussion is focussed on white supremacists, but similar arguments could be applied to any group that may be classed as a "hate group" \(without claiming that the NBPP is such - I know nothing about them specifically\).
1.2.7. Con: It is morally consistent. Such a move would apply basic moral values and act accordingly. The fact that only the far-right acts against those moral values does not make the move itself morally inconsistent.
1.2.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.2.8. Pro: To be morally consistent, moves to censor white supremacism must be matched with moves to censor viewpoints that are equally indefensible, such as communist totalitarianism, jihadi terrorism, pedophilia apology, and any defense of violent criminality.
1.2.9. Con: During the [Jim Crow Era](https://www.britannica.com/event/Jim-Crow-law) in the US and during Apartheid in South Africa, white supremacists denied services to others. It's appropriate to deny them services because of their hateful ideology.
1.2.9.1. Con: Nobody can be held accountable for the actions of others, so white supremacists in one country can not automatically be held responsible for the actions of supremacists in another country half a century ago.
1.2.9.2. Con: This reasoning perpetuates punishment rather than repair, and is therefore not benevolent or appropriate behaviour for internet companies.
1.2.10. Con: This claim is fallacious because it assumes the term 'far-right' merely refers to a political affiliation in the same way as the political right, therefore deserving free-speech protection. Instead, 'far-right' refers to hostile nationalist ideologies that do not reflect a legitimate political platform.
1.3. Con: Facebook and Twitter are legally obliged to delete accounts affiliated with terrorism.
1.3.1. Con: Accounts affiliated with ISIS and other terrorist organizations are protected under the [First Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) to the US Constitution which states that "Congress shall make no law \[...\] abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press."
1.3.1.1. Con: According to a Supreme Court [ruling from 1969](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/case.html), the First Amendment does not protect incitements to imminent lawless action such as violence, which is the main function of many accounts affiliated with ISIS.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Arguing that hateful speech is directly linked to violent action risks equating speech with actions.  This can lead to [chilling effects](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chilling_effect) on speech and government abuse: It could make people think twice before expressing non-mainstream views, since legal acts of speech might be equated with illegal action by the government whenever politically convenient  \([Lidsky, p. 161](http://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1216&context=facultypub)\).
1.3.1.1.2. Con: There is no proof that the hate speech and hashtag campaigns often orchestrated by accounts affiliated with terrorist organisations are "likely to produce" imminent violence as required by the so-called [Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio) test.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Its successful use of social media for propaganda and for [inciting attacks](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/11/19/fight-against-isis-reveals-power-of-social-media/) has been instrumental for the success of ISIS. Accounts affiliated with it can thus be considered an important cause of violent attacks across the world and are not protected by the First Amendment.
1.3.1.2. Con: According to a Supreme Court ruling from 2003, the First Amendment does not protect speech that has an "[intent to intimidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_v._Black)".
1.3.1.2.1. Con: Precedent on which kinds of speech have an intent to intimidate is unclear. For example, a 1977 Supreme Court decision held that the First Amendment [protected a march by the National Socialist Party of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie) through a predominantly Jewish town.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Existing case law indicates that regulation of speech needs to be viewpoint-neutral. For example, speech cannot be regulated because it is "offensive" or "[outrageous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snyder_v._Phelps)", or based on an "[undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District)".
1.3.1.4. Pro: Hateful speech is not the same as violent action and does not hurt anyone directly, it should thus be protected under the First Amendment.
1.3.1.5. Con: First Amendment rights can be restricted if necessary for an [important state interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System,_Inc._v._FCC) such as protecting national security.
1.3.1.6. Con: According to a [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holder_v._Humanitarian_Law_Project) and a [2014](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/09/mehanna_at_the_supreme_court_is_translating_jihad_texts_a_crime.html) Supreme Court case, political speech in support of terror groups can constitute [Material Support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providing_material_support_for_terrorism) for these organisations and thus be exempted from First Amendment protections.
1.3.1.6.1. Con: According to a [2010 Supreme Court case](http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/03/challenging-use-of-advocacy-as-terrorism/), the material support statute can only be applied to someone who coordinates with the relevant terror organisations. This is not the case for Internet companies, for whom white supremacists are simply regular customers.
1.3.1.7. Con: Even if the First Amendment protects white nationalists it is unclear why the U.S. has the best policy. The United States, with its extreme free speech protections, is an outlier amongst most western liberal democracies. Richard Spencer was banned in 2014 from all of the E.U. because European states [condemn](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/richard-bertrand-spencer-0) “all xenophobic and exclusionary organizations that discriminate based on religion or ethnicity.”
1.3.2. Con: [Section 230](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230_of_the_Communications_Decency_Act) of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 [protects online services](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/10/11950098/twitter-isis-lawsuit-safe-harbor-terrorism) from liability for speech published on their network.
1.3.2.1. Pro: In [November 2016](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/11/twitter-defeats-isis-material-support-lawsuit-again-fields-v-twitter.htm) and [May 2017,](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/terrorism-victims-cant-hold-facebook-liable-for-hamas-use-of-the-platform/)  two US courts respectively ruled that this law also protects Facebook and Twitter from liability for terrorist content published on their platform.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The [only established exception](https://ilt.eff.org/index.php/Defamation:_CDA_Cases#Section_230_and_Intellectual_Property) to the wide protections of Section 230 are intellectual property infringements. Thus, the section also protects networks from liability for accounts affiliated with terrorist organisations.
1.3.2.3. Con: Critics have argued that the way Section 230 is currently interpreted defeats its original purpose and should thus be updated.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Some critics argue that Section 230 has been [interpreted too favourably](http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1545&context=fclj) for Internet service providers and should be amended to include e.g. liability enabling sexual exploitation of children.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Section 230 was meant to create a space where [new platforms could grow and experiment](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-law-that-gave-us-the-modern-internet-and-the-campaign-to-kill-it/279588/) without impediments and thus contribute to the US economy. However, platforms like Facebook or Twitter have long ceased being fragile young startups and could easily bear the cost of taking more responsibility for the content hosted on their websites.
1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: Facebook turns a [profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) of more than $1 billion every year.
1.3.2.3.2.2. Con: Twitter is actually [struggling](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-results-metrics-idUSKBN15O2ZB) to become a profitable venture. Adding a significant new legal and thus financial burden might shut down the platform for good.
1.3.2.3.3. Pro: Section 230 is based on the assumption that platforms are neutral intermediaries that simply host their users' content. However, given the influence platforms have on [which content](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/opinion/the-real-bias-built-in-at-facebook.html) their users actually see, this assumption clearly does not reflect reality anymore.
1.3.2.3.3.1. Pro: All tech companies have [political biases](https://www.wired.com/2016/05/course-facebook-biased-thats-tech-works-today/) that are perpetuated in their algorithms.
1.3.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: It is a common misperception that algorithms are somehow rational. In reality, they can best be understood as [sets of rules determined by humans](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/upshot/when-algorithms-discriminate.html) - and since humans are irrational and biased, they often reproduce these biases when writing code.
1.3.2.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: For instance, if programmers are liberals in US politics, they might be inclined to classify liberal media as credible sources, while not doing so for sources like Breitbart or Fox News. If they write an algorithm that is meant to show users more credible news sources, such an algorithm would perpetuate a pro-liberal and anti-conservative bias in their timelines.
1.3.2.3.3.1.2. Con: Algorithms are mere mathematical functions and therewith not biased in themselves.
1.3.2.3.3.1.3. Pro: If the information used to [calibrate an algorithm](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601775/why-we-should-expect-algorithms-to-be-biased/) is [biased](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kH-P9xGy6LoJ:https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/artificial-intelligence-sea-dudes-problem/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us), this bias is reproduced in the algorithm.
1.3.2.3.4. Con: Given the enormous costs of thoroughly eliminating all accounts associated with terror organisations, even large corporations like Twitter and Facebook still deserve the protection of Section 230. Otherwise, they would not be able to concentrate on their core tasks anymore.
1.3.2.3.4.1. Pro: Eliminating all accounts linked to terror organisations would be burdensome for both Twitter and Facebook.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1. Pro: Eliminating terrorist accounts would be technically difficult for both Facebook and Twitter.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.1. Con: ISIS' social media accounts are managed by a relatively small and manageable group of [between 500 and 2,000](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/isis_twitter_census_berger_morgan.pdf) individual users.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: Terrorist accounts are close to impossible to identify before some revealing information is posted. Wiping them out before something can be posted would require to screen nearly all users.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Algorithms have been developed for Twitter that can efficiently predict new extremist users prior to posting content as well as identify the new accounts of previously suspended users. Applying these would significantly lessen the burden placed on Twitter's staff and its users to identify terrorist content [\(Klausen, Marks, and Zaman, p. 36\)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06242.pdf).
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.2.2. Con: Terrorist accounts are harmless before they have posted any information. Waiting until that happens is not a problem.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: Facebook and Twitter have to hire a large number of staff to develop artificial intelligence and fight terror organisations online, which will be very costly. For instance, specialised anti-terrorism moderators are usually based in countries like the US, where median yearly income is [$30,240](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_income_in_the_United_States), or [Ireland](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/04/conor-mcgregor-floyd-mayweather-fight-paulie-malignaggi), where average yearly salaries are [37,000€](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_average_wage).
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: Facebook hired [150 developers](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40290258) to improve the AI so that it can identify terrorist content.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: Facebook and Twitter need to hire more moderators to fight terrorism effectively. Just recently Facebook hired [3000](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/05/24/terrorists-can-easily-bypass-facebook-censorship-leaked-documents/) new moderators to fight terrorism on its page.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.3.3. Con: Facebook often outsources moderators to providers such as [PRO Unlimited](https://www.inverse.com/article/31130-facebook-live-murder-moderators-part-time-contractors) or [oDesk](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/9118778/The-dark-side-of-Facebook.html). This makes these moderators substantially cheaper, as it allows Facebook to circumvent labor laws in the US and hire cheap and flexible part-time workers in other countries.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.3.3.1. Con: The moderation of terrorist content requires special expertise and training, so it cannot simply be outsourced like more basic tasks.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Terrorist content is not comparatively more difficult. Facebook has equal problems to find the right balance with regard to [child pornography](http://fortune.com/2017/03/07/facebook-child-pornography/).
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: In order to effectively identify terrorist content posted by Indonesian users, the messenger app Telegram had to create a dedicated team of people familiar with [Indonesian politics and culture](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/16/telegram-blocks-terror-content-after-indonesia-threatens-ban.html).
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.4. Con: Creating a [database](http://nypost.com/2017/03/01/facebook-accepts-blood-money-from-terrorist-activities-lawsuits/) that compares terrorist posts and automatically deletes them, as is done with child porn, is a simple and cost-effective method to handle terrorist content.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft established such a database in [2016](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-counterterrorism-idUSKBN1962F8) and in Europe the AI deletes matching posts automatically.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.4.2. Con: In the case of child pornography, content can be easily matched and deleted because it takes the form of images and videos. Automated tools can very easily compare groups of pixels to identify duplicates, but doing so for text is incredibly difficult as it requires computers to understand the semantics of a message. Automatic matching against a database of content is much less likely to be effective in the case of terrorism.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, Facebook is already working to improve its algorithm in areas more complex than simple image matching, for example [language understanding](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/06/how-we-counter-terrorism/).
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.4.2.2. Con: Terror propaganda on social media has a strong audiovisual focus and is primarily based on the dissemination of photos and videos, so image matching is exactly the right tool for combatting it.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.4.2.3. Pro: Matching patterns and even objects between images is a task that technology is now capable of [performing to the level of a monkey](https://www.wired.com/2014/07/cadieu/) — which is more than enough to establish similarities between two images. Yet [advances in natural language processing have been much slower](https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/the-two-paths-from-natural-language-processing-to-artificial-intelligence-d5384ddbfc18) and find higher-level meanings difficult to parse.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.5. Con: Facebook identifies about [1300](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/05/24/terrorists-can-easily-bypass-facebook-censorship-leaked-documents/) terrorist posts per month but only deletes around 300. More stringent moderation guidelines are an easy way to fight terrorism online.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.6. Pro: Terrorist organizations can easily replace blocked accounts with new ones with fake names.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.6.1. Pro: Even if Facebook demands an official ID, these are not currently difficult to acquire.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: A reporter got an [official ID](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3235320/PASSPORT-TERROR-MailOnline-reporter-buys-Syrian-papers-sold-ISIS-fighters-sneaking-Europe-hidden-refugees.html) for as little as $2000.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.6.2. Con: One Twitter-based study found that even after a suspended account returned and was not immediately re-suspended, user activity decreased and rarely reached its previous heights. So although new accounts can be created, suspension/deletion clearly has a positive effect on curbing online terrorist activities [\(Berger, p. 9\)](https://cchs.gwu.edu/sites/cchs.gwu.edu/files/downloads/Berger_Occasional%20Paper.pdf).
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.1.2.1.
1.3.2.3.4.1.1.6.4. Con: Even if terror organisations could replace accounts at the same rate that they are deleted, this would at least take time, attention and other resources away from their other social media activities.
1.3.2.3.4.1.2. Con: Facebook and Twitter also ban other accounts. This did not hurt their business model either.
1.3.2.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: Facebook and Twitter delete content that is considered illegal already, e.g. [revenge porn](https://www.bustle.com/p/facebook-is-fighting-revenge-porn-with-these-important-new-tools-49513), [copyright infringements](https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2012/10/05/facebook-confirms-it-shut-down-the-cool-hunters-facebook-page-over-copyright-infringement/) or [hate speech](http://time.com/4150296/facebook-google-hate-speech-germany/).
1.3.2.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: Facebook deletes many fake news accounts, e.g. in [France](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/13/facebook-cracks-down-on-30000-fake-accounts-in-france.html).
1.3.2.3.4.1.3. Pro: Blocking terrorist accounts requires asking users to look for and report accounts they notice or interact with.
1.3.2.3.4.1.3.1. Con: There are groups of social activists and "hacktivists" who do this willingly, thus it is not putting an unwanted burden on anyone.
1.3.2.3.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: The infamous hacking collective [Anonymous](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/13/anonymous-hackers-islamic-state-isis-chan-online-war/) has been waging an online war against ISIS, during which they have dismantled hundreds of ISIS-linked websites and flagged well over 100,000 Twitter accounts.
1.3.2.3.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: Other social media sites have capitalized on this phenomenon; for example, YouTube has [deputized](http://www.popsci.com/terror-on-twitter-how-isis-is-taking-war-to-social-media) some human-rights groups as “trusted flaggers” to identify ISIS content. Facebook and Twitter could similarly delegate these duties to willing third parties.
1.3.2.3.4.1.3.2. Pro: Although Twitter uses proprietary spam-fighting tools to supplement the identification of extremist accounts, the majority of account identification is based on reports
from its users [\(Klausen, Marks, and Zaman, p. 2\)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06242.pdf).
1.3.2.3.4.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.1.2.1.
1.3.2.3.4.1.3.4. Con: These sites have been increasingly working to create alternatives to user policing. [For example](https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-terrorist-propaganda-still-a-challenge-for-tech-companies-1496712112?mg=prod/accounts-wsj), Twitter said internal technology flagged 74% of the 376,890 accounts it suspended for promoting terrorism between July-December 2016.
1.3.2.3.4.1.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.1.2.1.
1.3.2.3.4.1.4. Pro: Eliminating terrorist accounts would be costly for Facebook and Twitter.
1.3.2.3.4.1.4.1. Pro: A harsh crackdown could cost social media platforms users.
1.3.2.3.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: Facebook is already being harshly criticised by [the](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/02/05/facebook-censorship-and-the-war-on-free-speech/) [right](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/435185/facebooks-war-conservative-free-speech) for deleting conservative content and for [attacking freedom of speech](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/insider/why-i-quit-twitter-and-left-behind-35000-followers.html). Other societal groups are likely to follow suit if it starts deleting other content.
1.3.2.3.4.1.4.1.2. Pro: One of the main reasons people leave Twitter is not finding what they consider [useful information](https://qz.com/191524/why-people-quit-twitter/). Deleting content is likely to exacerbate this development.
1.3.2.3.4.1.4.1.3. Con: People of color who are attacked by white supremacists might leave these websites if they allow room for white supremacist propaganda.
1.3.2.3.4.1.4.1.4. Con: Twitter and other internet companies will come under public scrutiny if they give space to harmful views. This can also lead to people leaving these platforms.
1.3.2.3.4.1.4.1.5. Con: Losing some users is better than allowing potentially harmful content online.
1.3.2.3.4.1.4.2. Con: Twitter's [revenues](https://ycharts.com/companies/TWTR/revenues) have not changed significantly over the past years although it already deletes accounts with terrorist content. In fact, moderating abusive content was cited as a [reason](http://www.businessinsider.de/twitter-reports-q1-earnings-results-2017-4?r=US&IR=T) for why Twitter had a higher than expected growth.
1.3.2.3.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: As of August 2016, Twitter had already shut down over 360,000 ISIS-related accounts [\(Klausen, Marks, and Zaman, p. 2\)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.06242.pdf).
1.3.2.3.4.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.1.3.
1.3.2.3.4.1.4.4. Con: These sites are already creating new and more cost effective methods for removing terrorist content. For instance, 74% of the 376,890 accounts suspended by Twitter for promoting terrorism between July and December 2016 were [flagged by internal technology](https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-terrorist-propaganda-still-a-challenge-for-tech-companies-1496712112?mg=prod%2Faccounts-wsj).
1.3.2.3.4.1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.1.2.1.
1.3.2.3.4.1.5. Con: Removing terror organisations' accounts is a burden Facebook and Twitter can carry.
1.3.2.3.4.1.5.1. Pro: Facebook and Twitter are mature companies and can handle losses incurred.
1.3.2.3.4.1.5.2. Pro: Facebook has shown a remarkable [stable growth](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/) of accounts with no significant downturn in growth rates. It does not look like too much of a problem to lose a few terrorist accounts.
1.3.2.3.4.1.6. Con: Facebook and Twitter are moving into the direction of removing accounts already.
1.3.2.3.4.1.6.1. Pro: Facebook is removing content of terrorist organizations in [Europe](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40290258) already. Extending this to specific accounts is not a big step further.
1.3.2.3.4.1.6.1.1. Con: Blocking accounts is considerably different from removing content. Blocked users cannot reengage while users whose content was removed can post it again.
1.3.2.3.4.1.6.1.2. Pro: If an account only posts content that will be removed this is equal to a blocked account.
1.3.2.3.4.1.6.2. Pro: Twitter deletes terror accounts at an [increasing rate](http://myfox8.com/2017/03/23/twitters-purging-terror-accounts-at-a-dizzying-rate-tmwsp/): in the second half of 2016 they deleted more than three times the number of accounts that they had deleted in previous years.
1.3.2.3.4.1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.4.2.1.
1.3.2.3.4.1.6.4. Con: Just because an action is already underway does not mean that it should necessarily continue.
1.3.2.3.4.2. Pro: Thoroughly deleting all accounts affiliated with terror organisations requires heavy surveillance of user activity, which can lead to [chilling effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect).
1.3.2.3.4.2.1. Pro: Given that there are a lot of grey areas and that determining an account's degree of affiliation with a terror organisation is a judgement call, users might restrict their activity online out of fear of having their accounts deleted.
1.3.2.3.4.2.2. Con: If deleting certain accounts also leads to less extremist propaganda being spread on Facebook and Twitter overall, these chilling effects are a good thing.
1.3.2.3.4.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.3.4.
1.3.2.3.5. Pro: In Europe, platforms are already being held responsible for the content they host, e.g. through court rulings such as the so-called "[right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten)", and this has not led to their demise.
1.3.2.3.6. Con: Whether Section 230 is being interpreted correctly is up to the courts and they have [consistently](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/11/twitter-defeats-isis-material-support-lawsuit-again-fields-v-twitter.htm) [defended](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2017/06/section-230-protects-googles-decision-not-to-de-index-content-bennett-v-google.htm) [platforms'](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2017/03/section-230-protects-grindr-from-harrassed-users-claims-herrick-v-grindr.htm) [exemption](http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2016/03/big-win-for-free-speech-online-in-backpage-lawsuit-forbes-cross-post.htm) from liability.
1.3.2.3.7. Con: Any changes to Section 230 would effectively encourage content hosters to act as censors. This is politically and socially undesirable.
1.3.2.3.8. Con: Holding platforms responsible for the content they host would stifle innovation since small, up and coming platforms [do not have the resources](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/09/the-law-that-gave-us-the-modern-internet-and-the-campaign-to-kill-it/279588/) to actively police everything that happens on their websites.
1.3.2.3.8.1. Pro: Such a policy would unfairly advantage big companies that can afford to hire large groups of lawyers and effectively eliminate the fair competition of a free market.
1.3.2.3.8.2. Con: If such a policy can save lives by lowering the number of terror attacks, this would be worth having slightly less innovation.
1.3.2.3.8.2.1. Con: The actual danger of dying from terrorism tends to be vastly exaggerated, especially in the [US](https://qz.com/898207/the-psychology-of-why-americans-are-more-scared-of-terrorism-than-guns-though-guns-are-3210-times-likelier-to-kill-them/) or [Europe](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nice-attack-do-you-feel-like-youre-more-likely-than-ever-to-be-hit-by-a-terror-attack-this-is-why-a7140396.html), so it is questionable whether this policy would actually save any lives and if so, whether that number would be meaningful.
1.3.2.3.8.2.1.1. Pro: Between 2005 and 2015, only 94 US Americans died in terrorist attacks, while 301.797 were [shot](https://qz.com/898207/the-psychology-of-why-americans-are-more-scared-of-terrorism-than-guns-though-guns-are-3210-times-likelier-to-kill-them/). Consequently, innovation leading to stricter gun laws might for example save many more lives than combatting terror organisations online.
1.3.2.3.8.2.1.2. Pro: Only the years [1998 to 2006](https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism/) saw a a marked increase in terror incidents. Before and after the number was low.
1.3.2.3.8.2.2. Con: The link between holding online platforms legally responsible for terrorist content and saving lives is tenuous. Technological innovation, on the other hand, is projected to save a significant number of lives, e.g. through [remote medicine](https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/oct/21/technology-key-saving-lives-thousands-medicine).
1.3.2.3.8.2.3. Pro: If only some of the tens of [thousands of people](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2016/11/18/countries-most-affected-by-terrorism/#32a0010d30d9) killed in terror attacks every year can be saved, there is a moral obligation to do so.
1.3.2.3.8.3. Pro: For smaller platforms, such as [Kialo](https://www.kialo.com/), this would not be possible as they lack the ability to police everything on their website.
1.3.3. Con: Legislation limiting freedom of speech is a sensitive issue in US politics. Previous attempts at creating some legal obligation to combat terrorist speech online more effectively such as the Combat Terrorist Use of [Social Media Act of 2015](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2517) have all [failed](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr3654).
1.3.4. Pro: A number of countries have laws against terrorist content online. Since they are accessible worldwide, social media and other Internet companies need to comply with these laws.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Germany has strict anti-hatespeech laws that [criminalise "incitement to hatred"](http://cco.ndu.edu/News/Article/780274/chapter-13-recruitment-and-radicalization-the-role-of-social-media-and-new-tech/) and recently introduced [high fines for social media platforms](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/06/30/germany-fine-facebook-youtube-50m-fail-delete-hate-speech/) that do not effectively combat hatespeech. Both of these laws could be used to justify deleting accounts linked to terror organisations.
1.3.4.2. Pro: The [UK and France](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-france-may-idUSKBN1942XJ) are in the middle of developing stricter laws combatting terrorist content online. Among other things, the UK government has [threatened to fine](http://news.sky.com/story/britain-and-france-vow-to-stamp-out-evil-online-extremism-10913864) social media companies that do not become more active in removing terrorist content.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Legal reasons aside, commercial interests compel companies to comply with local laws since they would like to continue operating globally.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: Although contradictory to its stated principles of openness, Facebook has been accused of bowing to [government pressure in Thailand](http://mashable.com/2017/05/09/facebook-thailand-censorship/#O282YP5yikqn) and censoring certain posts.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: Governments can exert pressure on companies by threatening to block them if they do not comply with local laws.
1.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: Nondemocratic countries \(including [China](https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/28/6859993/instagram-reportedly-blocked-in-mainland-china-following-hong-kong-protests), [Turkey](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/facebook-twitter-whatsapp-turkey-erdogan-blocked-opposition-leaders-arrested-a7396831.html), [Russia](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tecnent-wechat-russia-idUSKBN18204J) and [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Iran)\) regularly block websites for not complying with local laws or hosting content incompatible with the ruling government's views.
1.3.4.3.3. Con: Internet companies like Facebook or Twitter are powerful commercial actors that can stand up to government pressure if they decide to do so.
1.3.4.3.3.1. Pro: In Brazil, Facebook-owned WhatsApp has for years [refused to hand over](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-vice-president-latin-america-arrested-brazil-diego-dzoda-a6907291.html) information demanded as part of criminal investigations.
1.3.4.3.3.2. Pro: After being heavily criticised for its involvement with US intelligence services, [Twitter publicly announced](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/13/why-twitter-chose-to-do-battle-with-the-cia.html) it would not let the CIA access its users' information any longer.
1.3.4.3.3.3. Pro: Twitter rejected to share information of users who shared anti-Semitic content in [France](https://gigaom.com/2013/03/27/why-twitter-is-doing-the-right-thing-by-refusing-to-identify-users-who-posted-anti-semitic-comments/).
1.3.4.3.3.4. Pro: Twitter [identified](https://gigaom.com/2012/05/08/twitter-were-still-the-free-speech-wing-of-the-free-speech-party/) itself as "free speech wing of the free speech party". Cooperation with the intent to cut down free speech is unlikely.
1.3.4.3.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.6.2.
1.3.4.3.3.5. Con: Internet companies are not the correct actors to make the definitional judgement calls on who counts as a terror organisation.
1.3.4.3.3.5.1. Pro: If someone is categorised as a terror organisation, they effectively also lose the right to freedom of speech. Tech executives lack the political legitimacy to make such important decisions, they should only be made by political representatives.
1.3.4.3.3.5.1.1. Con: Since there is no world government, there are no political representatives who do have the legitimacy to make such far-reaching decisions for two global platforms.
1.3.4.3.3.5.2. Con: With almost [2 billion](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/01/technology/facebook-earnings/index.html) and [319 million](https://www.recode.net/2017/2/9/14558890/trump-twitter-user-growth) users respectively, more people voluntarily subject themselves to decisions made by Twitter and Facebook than those of any government.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3. Con: Governments all around the world publish lists of officially designated terror organisations. Facebook and Twitter can base their decisions on those lists and delete accounts affiliated with any organisation on those lists.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.1. Con: Since Facebook and Twitter are legally registered in the US, only US law should be applied to them.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.1.1. Pro: If Twitter or Facebook have no company representative in a given country, it is impossible to hold them liable for not complying with local laws.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Brazilian courts have long tried to legally hold WhatsApp accountable for not complying with court orders as part of a criminal proceedings. This has been a complicated and messy process, at one point leading to the arrest of a Facebook executive, since WhatsApp itself does not have a [legal representative on Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/01/brazil-police-arrest-facebook-latin-america-vice-president-diego-dzodan). To public knowledge, the Brazilian government has been unsuccessful so far.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.1.2. Pro: According to the [two main theories](https://hbr.org/2006/10/the-rise-of-corporate-nationality) of corporate nationality, a company's nationality is either defined by its place of incorporation or its main seat of business. Under both of these definitions, Twitter and Facebook are US companies.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.1.3. Con: US-based Internet companies are already forced to comply with non-US laws under existing jurisprudence.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: In 2014, a German court ruled that Facebook had to comply with [German data protection laws](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2098720/facebook-must-comply-with-german-data-protection-law-court-rules.html) despite its EU headquarter being located in Ireland.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.1.3.2. Pro: In 2000, a French court decided that Yahoo! had to [comply with French laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LICRA_v._Yahoo!) when it distributed content to French users, regardless of where the company was based.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: The French court ruled that it [had jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LICRA_v._Yahoo!#Competence_of_the_French_court) because the content in question was accessible in France, violated French law, while Yahoo! was aware of French users accessing it.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: US courts later ruled that the French court's decision only applied to France and [could not be enforced in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LICRA_v._Yahoo!#Proceedings_in_the_United_States), thus reinforcing the idea of different regulatory regimes for users in different countries.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2. Con: Complying with the laws of every single country where the services of Internet companies are accessible would be impractical.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.1. Con: Using geolocation and the [wealth of information](https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2017/04/26/ever-wonder-what-facebook-knows-about-you-heres-how-to-find-out/) social media companies like Twitter or Facebook possess about their users, it would be easy for them to apply different regulatory regimes based on the jurisdiction users are based in.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: Facebook uses a [specific combination](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/facebook-pride-reaction/531633/) of users' interests and their location to decide whether they can use "Pride" reacts.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.1.2. Pro: [Facebook](http://www.dw.com/en/countries-with-the-most-blocks-on-facebook-content/a-36023902) and [Twitter](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170927) already geo-block or withhold content in France and Germany to comply with national laws.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.2. Pro: Facebook and Twitter sell inherently global rather than regionalised products - no matter whether someone uses the platform in German or in Bahasa Melayu, they all have access to the same content and can follow the same people.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.2.1. Pro: The inherently global nature of multinational companies makes it effectively impossible to only apply EU laws to EU customers. As a result, many multinational companies have restructured their whole business to comply with [EU privacy laws](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106574949477122300).
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.2.2. Con: Facebook has been accused of cooperating with governments in [Israel](https://theintercept.com/2016/09/12/facebook-is-collaborating-with-the-israeli-government-to-determine-what-should-be-censored/), [Russia](https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/22/7433277/facebook-blocks-alexei-navalny-protest-page-russia-putin) and [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/technology/facebook-censorship-tool-china.html) to censor content these governments did not want to be accessible in their respective countries.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.3. Con: Even if it is difficult to comply with the laws of every single country, striving to protect people from harm is more important and is necessary.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.2.1.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.3. Con: Showing users different content based on their geolocation or country of origin would undermine Twitter's and Facebook's nature as open and transnational platforms.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.3.1. Con: Facebook and Twitter already show filtered content. Adding a geographic location as an important variable in the algorithm is no unknown approach. [Google](http://www.webpresencesolutions.net/7-reasons-google-search-results-vary-dramatically/), for example, provides results based on location.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.1.1.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.3.2. Con: Yes, it would undermine the open nature of Facebook and the internet. But the blame for this should fall on the shoulders of those specific countries and their political processes that created these policies.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4. Con: Since there is [no internationally agreed upon definition](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/defining-terrorism-in-international-law-9780199295975?cc=us&lang=en&) of terrorism, countries can exploit the concept to label political opponents as 'terrorists'.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.1. Pro: The Tibetan government in exile and Tibetan independence activists are considered [separatist agitators](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tibet-idUSKBN16H0RB) by the Chinese government, but freedom fighters by others. The Chinese government could plausibly argue that they qualify as a terror organisation that would need to be combated online.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.2. Pro: The [Gülen Movement](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36855846) \(known as "Hizmet" in Turkish\) was designated a [terrorist organisation](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-gulen-idUSKCN0YM167) by the Turkish government, but is considered simply a civic or religious movement by most other countries.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3. Con: Organisations like ISIS are an exception in that they fundamentally challenge the basis of the international order. Hence, it is clearly in the interest of every single nation state to combat them.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.1. Con: ISIS is simply a modern repetition of old patterns: its basic propaganda and military strategy are comparable to that of many other [insurgent guerrilla movements](http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/523/html) such as the Chinese communists during the Chinese Civil War.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2. Con: Nation building was and often still is an inherently repressive project that disadvantages minorities, and should be challenged.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: During the Turkish nation state building project, sizeable and established non-Muslim minorities such as Jews and Greeks were [not accepted](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870701491937?src=recsys&journalCode=rers20) as part of the new Turkish society.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.2. Pro: Nations are [imagined communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_community) that can only exist because they are based on a broad notion of an ingroup that is defined against an [outgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups). Hence, the process of nation building is inherently exclusionist.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.3. Pro: In Myanmar, the ongoing contention over who can legitimately claim being a citizen has led to [violent internal conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Myanmar) and the oppression of particularly vulnerable minority groups like the [Rohingya](https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21654124-myanmars-muslim-minority-have-been-attacked-impunity-stripped-vote-and-driven).
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4. Con: Nation-building is often constructed using geographic borders, rather than majoritarian identities, to define the outgroup. Doing so means that nationalism is focused on the differences between that country and other ones, rather than the process of exacerbating divisions within a country that often ends up excluding minority identities.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.1. Pro: States often develop distinct national identities by focusing on values that appeal across ethnic divisions such as sport or historic events.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: For example New Zealand emphasises its rugby prowess to differentiate itself from Australia and to present a wider cultural narrative of punching above its weight.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.1.2. Pro: For example, post-apartheid South Africa emphasised its rugby team as a point of national pride that symbolised the nation’s embrace of multiculturalism.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.1.2.1. Con: It is easy to celebrate symbols in isolated instances, but South Africa is no unified, multicultural utopia. Instead, it is based on a deeply colonial history, where people continue to [perpetuate racist tropes](https://academic.oup.com/afraf/article/111/445/551/47260) from the Apartheid era and black South Africans are clearly disadvantaged on a [socioeconomic level](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/06/chart-of-the-week-how-south-africa-changed-and-didnt-over-mandelas-lifetime/).
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.2. Pro: At the time of its founding Singapore was demographically similar to Malaysia but developed a separate, and much more [tolerant](http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/the-race-issue-how-far-has-singapore-come), identity through national education programs that emphasised multiculturalism \(e.g. by teaching in English\).
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.2.4.2.1. Con: Despite this multicultural ideal, in reality, [Chinese Singaporeans](http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/the-race-issue-how-far-has-singapore-come) remain the [dominant majority](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-respect-all-races-but-racism-still-an-issue-survey) and there is still [discrimination](https://qz.com/768706/the-racist-reality-of-house-hunting-in-singapore-sorry-your-wife-is-indian/) against ethnic minorities.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.3. Pro: Even if nation states have different political systems, the current international order is based on the agreement that its basic units are sovereign nation states whose territory is inviolable. ISIS' attempt at establishing an Islamic caliphate is a fundamental challenge to this widely agreed upon order \([Krasner, p. 59](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/problematic-sovereignty/9780231505413), [Bartelson, p. 210](https://books.google.de/books/about/A_Genealogy_of_Sovereignty.html?id=yokespTH2G4C&redir_esc=y)\).
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.3.1. Pro: The current international order is largely based on the respect for [states' territory](http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-i/). ISIS is based on [transnational ideology and practice](http://www.e-ir.info/2014/08/21/the-islamic-states-challenge-to-the-international-system/) aimed at undermining this fundamental organising principle.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.3.2. Pro: ISIS challenges existing borders in the Middle East, which [nationalist movements](http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/isis-and-world-order-139021644) used as the basis of their fight for political independence.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.3.3.3. Con: The international order can change and is already doing so with the consent of many of its members. This is evidenced by the creation of transnational entities like the European Union.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.4. Con: There are cases where there is widespread agreement that a specific organisation is a 'terror organisation'. For [example](http://www.globalresearch.ca/muslim-leaders-worldwide-condemn-isis/5397364), the Arab league, the Vatican, or Nahdlatul Ulama, one of the largest Islamic organisations, condemn ISIS.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.4.1. Con: Even global unity can be a unreliable metric for determining who counts as a terrorist, since the majority is not necessarily in the right.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: During the era of decolonisation, the dominant narrative perpetuated by colonial powers cast most national liberation movements as terrorists. Nowadays, they are celebrated as heroes.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.5. Con: Oppressive regimes will always label political opponents as “terrorists” — removing social media accounts selectively draws attention to which regimes have legitimate claims and which do not.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.4.5.1. Con: Even if this attention is created, it is ultimately ineffectual. For instance, extensive reporting on Twitter's compliance with Turkish government demands for censorship has not done anything to undermine it. On the contrary, [it has gotten worse](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/twitter-censorship-journalists-turkey-coup/).
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.5. Con: This would be a questionable way of defining terror organisations since it would enable individual governments, democratic and authoritarian alike, to censor the Internet and undermine freedom of expression all over the world. They would simply need to designate an entity as a terror organisation and all their accounts would be deleted entirely.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.6. Pro: Facebook and Twitter do not have a 'terror definition unit' and, so far, follow what states would classify as 'terror organization'. Facebook blocks content according to [French law](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/09/french-law-blocking-terrorist-and-child-abuse-sites-comes-into-effect) for example.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.6.1. Con: Facebook and Twitter do not uncritically follow the laws of every single country they operate in.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.6.1.1. Pro: One of the reasons [Twitter](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/168607/20160706/twitter-is-banned-in-china-so-how-does-it-have-10-million-users-there.htm) is blocked in [China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinas-scary-lesson-to-the-world-censoring-the-internet-works/2016/05/23/413afe78-fff3-11e5-8bb1-f124a43f84dc_story.html?utm_term=.f67f8880a087), North Korea and Iran is that the company refuses to censor content according to the will of these countries' governments.
1.3.4.3.3.5.3.6.2. Pro: In Turkey, Twitter follows even questionable laws and [blocks content extensively](https://www.buzzfeed.com/burcukarakas/how-turkey-became-the-top-censor-of-twitter-accounts-worldwi?utm_term=.kqDYNgqx6#.dl74oKGzX).
1.3.4.3.3.5.4. Pro: Determining which accounts are actually affiliated with terror organisations requires special expertise which Facebook and Twitter do not have.
1.3.4.3.3.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.1.3.3.1.2.
1.3.4.3.3.5.4.2. Con: A normal human being is capable of seeing the evil of those who advocate for murder and mass genocide. Twitter and Facebook are comprised of human beings.
1.3.4.3.3.5.5. Pro: Facebook and Twitter are companies ultimately responsible primarily to their shareholders and investors. Being responsible to investors allows economic incentives to influence definitional judgement calls.
1.3.4.3.3.6. Con: It is not within the ability of Internet companies to assess what constitutes a terrorist organisation or content.
1.3.4.3.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.3.5.3.
1.3.4.3.3.7. Con: However powerful they may be, internet companies will always be less powerful than states. [Pakistan](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1568051/1-twitter-reacts-faizabad-crackdown/) banned the likes of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and Pakistan by no means has the strongest state apparatus in the world.
1.3.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.2.2.
1.3.4.3.5. Pro: For years, Facebook has been trying to get unblocked in China in order to access the enormous Chinese market. In the process of this, Facebook executives have been quite willing to [cozy up to the authoritarian Chinese government](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/20/facebooks-mark-zuckerberg-meets-china-propaganda-chief-in-beijing) and allegedly offered to censor content for Chinese users.
1.3.4.4. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.3.5.3.1.
1.3.4.5. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.3.5.3.2.
1.3.4.6. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.3.5.3.3.
1.3.5. Con: Requiring them to delete all accounts affiliated with terrorist organisations places an [undue burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undue_burden_standard) on Facebook and Twitter.
1.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.1.
1.3.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.1.4.
1.3.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.4.1.4.
1.3.6. Pro: The [USA PATRIOT Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act) obliges Facebook and Twitter to delete terror accounts by making it illegal to provide material support to terrorists.
1.3.6.1. Pro: A number of lawsuits \(most recently in [January 2017](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-lawsuits-social-media-terror-20170119-story.html)\) have argued that Facebook and Twitter are "providing material support" to ISIS by letting the organisation use their platforms. The same principle applies to violent white supremacist organisations.
1.3.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.6.
1.3.6.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.6.1.
1.3.6.4. Con: The Patriot Act is only relevant in the US, while social media and internet companies provide content and services globally.
1.3.6.5. Con: The Patriot Act also [enables government surveillance on virtually all internet traffic and abuses have been well documented](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23123964), thus, it follows not everything authorized by the law is moral, and it could be the case here.
1.3.6.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.3.7. Con: This is an appeal to authority due to its reliance exclusively on current law rather than a merit- and evidence-based argument. If moral judgments were reliant exclusively upon current law as it is purported to be in the context of this claim, nothing would ever change in society. As such, this is an invalid claim.
1.3.7.1. Con: Since every legal system represents the legislated version of a system of morality for all of society, it is a possible metric for assessing whether a certain act was moral according to the standards of that society.
1.3.8. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.3.9. Pro: There are kinds of [Right-wing terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_terrorism) supported by some white supremacy groups. While not all white supremacists are supporting terrorism it might be required for SOME content or accounts to be deleted.
1.3.10. Pro: In Germany a new law the [NetzDG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/netzdg/BJNR335210017.html) forces big social networks \(like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube\) to remove or block "obvious illegal" content within a given time-frame after they have been informed.
1.3.10.1. Pro: Given German laws banning [Holocaust denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial#Germany) and against [Volksverhetzung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung) \(the incitement of hatred against segments of the population\), substantial amounts of White supremacist speech are likely to be illegal and thus fall under this new law.
1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.
1.5. Pro: White supremacists, like followers of any other political ideology, deserve to have their voices heard.
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.4.1.
1.5.2. Con: White supremacy isn’t a real or plausible political ideology – it’s simply the unnecessary hatred of another person because of their ethnicity and the belief that one race is superior.
1.5.2.1. Pro: This kind of backwards, dangerous thinking has no place in politics. If an ideology's message is one of unprovoked hatred, then these voices have surrendered the right to be heard.
1.5.3. Pro: White supremacist viewpoints are not intrinsically violent. Many white supremacists advocate separatism in the first instance, a clamp-down on immigration, and in many cases deportation. They may organise non-violent marches or demonstrations. Violence against others is not a prerequisite, despite the frequent correlation.
1.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Even some of the most [extreme white supremacist](https://natall.com/about/what-we-believe/) groups very strongly emphasise that they are non-violent. While their followers may act as they wish, the groups are at pains to distance themselves from any illegal action.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: Statements by white supremacists that they are non-violent are deeply dishonest and often belied by the actions of the same people who made those statements.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: [Christopher Cantwell](http://www.complex.com/life/2017/08/emotional-white-supremacist-from-vice-news-charlottesville-doc-says-hes-terrified-in-video-to-police) epitomises this – filmed in the midst of the Charlottesville rally, he openly stated: "We're not nonviolent. We'll fucking kill these people if we have to." After the fact, he tried to claim they were trying to be 'law-abiding' and 'peaceful'.
1.5.3.3. Pro: Organisations like the National Association for the Protection of White People \([NAPWP](http://napwp.org/)\) exist for the protection of white people, and is adamant that it is not - nor would ever support - violence.
1.5.3.3.1. Con: The NAPWP has explicitly used forums such as [Stormfront](https://donotlink.it/qRBr), which clearly identifies as white supremacist and has been nicknamed the "murder capital of the Internet" due to the disproportionate involvement of its members in [lethal hate crimes and mass killings](https://www.splcenter.org/20140331/white-homicide-worldwide).
1.5.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.5.3.5. Pro: [An Alt-Right manifesto](https://altright.com/2017/08/11/what-it-means-to-be-alt-right/), which focuses strongly on aspects of white supremacism, at no point advocates violence. It asks for reform, separatism and free speech and is transparently sexist and racist, but avoids any and all mention of violence. Consequently, there are no valid grounds for censorship.
1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.
1.5.5. Con: Part of the problem with allowing white supremacists a voice is not merely that they will shout racist slogans; the real concern is how they rally people to their cause, and use clever, considered rhetoric to manipulate and strengthen their support base.
1.5.5.1. Pro: The Daily Stormer achieves this by facilitating action without explicitly endorsing violence or intimidation: they lambaste certain individuals and link their social media accounts. This allows followers to act of their own volition \(often with violence or intimidation\) without the Daily Stormer technically being responsible. They are entirely aware of this manipulation and state as much in their '[Daily Stormer Style Guide](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/daily-stormer-nazi-style-guide_us_5a2ece19e4b0ce3b344492f2)'.
1.5.5.2. Pro: [The Daily Stormer Style Guide](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/daily-stormer-nazi-style-guide_us_5a2ece19e4b0ce3b344492f2) is concerned with ensuring their tone and approach is light, so as not to put off those still dabbling in white supremacism. 'Genuine raging vitriol' is offputting for the 'overwhelming majority' of readers; they design their content to quietly, gently indoctrinate people to more extreme views.
1.5.5.3. Pro: The rhetorical propaganda techniques utilised on [The Daily Stormer](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/daily-stormer-nazi-style-guide_us_5a2ece19e4b0ce3b344492f2) include constant repetition of key ideas, hidden in 'naughty humour' and applied indiscriminately to current events to slant people's perception of different situations. They want to target new readers and constantly expand their numbers; this is an evident societal danger, modelled on Hitler's propaganda techniques in Mein Kampf.
1.5.5.4. Pro: [The Daily Stormer](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/daily-stormer-nazi-style-guide_us_5a2ece19e4b0ce3b344492f2) is designed to dehumanise human beings, to the point that 'people will laugh at their deaths'; there is a 'Daily Stormer Style Guide', which states that dehumanisation is only permissible in light-hearted articles, so it can pass by unnoticed.
1.5.5.5. Con: Every political movement can potentially make use of "clever, considered rhetoric" to "manipulate and strengthen their support base", not only white supremacists. Considering this, denying white supremacists a voice would be denying every other political movement a voice in this instance.
1.5.5.6. Pro: White supremacists can be innovative in their recruitment methods. Even something as ostensibly innocent as [Pokemon GO](http://www.vocativ.com/357002/alt-right-pokemon-go-nazi-challenge/index.html) was targeted by white supremacists, who may have handed out flyers to children as young as ten. Andrew Anglin openly stated that this was intended to 'brainwash' younger children, who would then be 'Nazi\[s\] for life'. With this in mind, restricting the platforms and means available to them is imperative.
1.5.6. Pro: These actions violate the right to freedom of speech of those whose content is removed.
1.5.6.1. Con: Most countries rightfully allow private corporations to censor speech in certain situations.
1.5.6.1.1. Pro: The [First Amendment](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/27/politics/first-amendment-explainer-trnd/index.html) only applies to the US government, not to private companies.
1.5.6.1.1.1. Con: The First Amendment is not synonymous with the broader natural right of free speech, so its parameters and limitations are entirely irrelevant to the question.
1.5.6.1.1.2. Pro: At its core, the First Amendment is aimed at protecting citizens from government censorship.
1.5.6.1.1.3. Con: Given the importance of social media in our lives and the power of many Internet companies, states also need laws protecting citizens from censorship through powerful private companies.
1.5.6.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.
1.5.6.1.2. Pro: [Article 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights) of the European Convention on Human Rights protects free speech, but does note that censorship may be necessary for democracy, security, safety, authority, health and/or morality. As such, companies who choose to remove content are protected under these terms.
1.5.6.1.3. Con: The [Bill of Rights of the South African Constitution](https://verdict.justia.com/2017/08/23/free-speech-issues-raised-internet-companies-denying-service-neo-nazi-sites) applies to private corporations, thus preventing them from arbitrarily restricting free speech.
1.5.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.
1.5.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.
1.5.6.4. Con: Internet companies are private entities. They are not bound to provide freedom of speech to others. In fact their right to shape and form their content is their protected free speech.
1.5.6.4.1. Pro: "Free speech" only means the government cannot hold you criminally liable for your speech. Just as an employer could fire someone for using racial slurs at work and not face a free speech lawsuit, private businesses like internet service providers are under no obligation whatsoever to do business with white supremacists, and should be able to reserve the right to refuse service.
1.5.6.5. Con: Free speech does not forbid the censoring of particularly offensive content within a particular forum, rather it protects a person from criminal consequences from what they have expressed within a forum where it is allowed
1.5.6.6. Con: Freedom of speech exists only to facilitate the manifestation of our society based on moral principles. Civil rights, is one of those principles. So discrimination based on ethnicity \(and religion, gender, ability, and age\) is determined to be immoral. White supremacists disagree with this and have only one goal: a society in which civil rights is not one of those principles.  If we don’t want to allow them to achieve that goal then we should not tolerate or permit arguments in favor of it.
1.5.6.7. Con: Freedom of speech is a [liberty right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claim_rights_and_liberty_rights), which means that nobody can prevent anybody from speaking. However, it is not a claim right, so it does not confer an obligation on anyone to provide a platform for other people's speech.
1.5.6.8. Pro: The only legitimate reason for removing content is illegality. As such, nobody has a right to remove legal content - neither private companies nor any other body.
1.5.6.8.1. Pro: The Daily Stormer was not posting illegal content, '[just terrible content](https://www.ft.com/content/c68751f0-82cc-11e7-94e2-c5b903247afd)' rendering its removal unjustified.
1.5.6.9. Con: White supremacists are still free to use private platforms which tolerate their views or to create their own platforms.
1.5.6.9.1. Con: Due to high rates of internet vigilantism, major platforms can be the only safe space for controversial groups.
1.5.6.9.1.1. Pro: ["The size and scale of the attacks that can now easily be launched online make it such that if you don't have a network like Cloudflare in front of your content, and you upset anyone, you will be knocked offline."](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-we-terminated-daily-stormer/)
1.5.6.9.2. Con: If a person is denied any serious platform, it is tantamount to denying freedom of speech. An analogy could be drawn from segregation. As in employing black people used to be legal, but in practice many people couldn't find a job because no one would hire them.
1.5.6.9.3. Pro: White supremacists have a right to air their views, but not an unlimited right to be granted every platform possible on which they can air their views.
1.5.6.10. Pro: Freedom of speech means that nobody, neither the government nor private enterprises, should have the right to decide who gets to speak and who does not.
1.5.6.10.1. Pro: It is virtually impossible to [articulate a standard](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/09/28/why-we-must-still-defend-free-speech/) for suppression of speech that would not afford government officials broad discretion and invite discrimination against particular viewpoints.
1.5.6.10.1.1. Pro: Like white supremacist speech, speech against affirmative action policies and speech supporting the viewpoint that men and women are genetically different can also be perceived as extremely offensive and can lead to the violation of some liberties for specific demographic groups. However, there are clear differences between the two. A government's decision to censor speech will always be inherently arbitrary.
1.5.6.10.2. Pro: Repercussions for illegal speech should be reactive, not preemptive. Internet companies should not censor before the fact, but only once an act violating the law or their terms of service has actually occurred.
1.5.6.10.2.1. Pro: Even if one is a white supremacist, they can take part in all forms of speech, and campaign for various causes which have nothing to do with white supremacy. To deny someone a service they could use for other purposes just because of an ideology they may never even bring onto the platform is unfair.
1.5.6.10.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.2.
1.5.6.10.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.
1.5.6.10.3. Con: Freedom of speech is not an unlimited right, and therefore can be curtailed.
1.5.6.10.3.1. Con: Accepting that freedom of speech is not completely inalienable \(threats, state secrets, slander\) doesn't in itself negate the fact that someone's right to freedom of speech is being violated.
1.5.6.10.3.1.1. Pro: As a comparison, we may accept that the right to freedom is not inalienable, since we imprison criminals. But that doesn't justify imprisoning whomever we please.
1.5.6.10.3.2. Pro: White supremacist's ideology limits other people's freedom. Their right to free speech is less important than the right of the targeted minorities not to be accused on the basis of how they are born.
1.5.6.10.3.3. Con: Freedom of speech can only exist in absolute form.
1.5.6.10.3.3.1. Pro: Censoring any speech is the equivalent of telling individuals what they are allowed to think, and subsequently passing moral judgement on their thoughts. This should never be allowed as this undermines an individuals ability to think freely.
1.5.6.10.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.1.1.
1.5.6.10.3.4. Pro: If a particular type of speech prevents others from voicing themselves, then that type of speech should be restricted.
1.5.6.10.3.4.1. Con: Taken as a universal principle, this could also support an argument for allowing white supremacists to "voice themselves" in any chosen forum, as publishers and platforms also rely on free speech when they engage in editorial discretion to restrict what is published within their domains. Even if we accept it for argument's sake, it is at best ambivalent support for the issue at hand.
1.5.6.10.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.
1.5.6.10.3.6. Pro: Most countries place limits on freedom of speech.
1.5.6.10.3.6.1. Pro: In [many jurisdictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat), it is illegal to threaten someone else's life.
1.5.6.10.3.6.1.1. Pro: Much of the rhetoric coming from White Supremacists involves establishing an ethno-state, which requires the forceful removal or termination of non-white races. That is violent speech, which is not covered by current interpretations of the US First Amendment.
1.5.6.10.3.6.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.4.1.2.6.1.
1.5.6.10.3.6.2. Pro: Speech that is designed to encourage illegal acts is not protected by the first amendment. There are laws on labor discrimination, housing discrimination and anti hate crimes that supporters of these causes encourage.
1.5.6.10.3.6.3. Con: That laws currently exist is not evidence of their morality.
1.5.6.10.3.6.4. Pro: In Canada, free speech is a right. However – consequences from speaking freely are not protected in areas that harm others, specifically [libel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_defamation_law) and [hate-speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_Canada).
1.5.6.10.3.6.5. Pro: Speech that [incites hatred, discrimination, slander and racial insults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_by_country#Germany) is illegal in nearly all European states, as that causes direct harm to individuals.
1.5.6.10.3.6.6. Pro: Speech that incites panic is also not protected under freedom of speech, as determined in [Schenck vs US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States) in 1918: "The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic".
1.5.6.10.3.6.6.1. Con: The point of Schenck v. US is that a person cannot use the first amendment to escape legally liability for the direct consequences of his/her speech. Simply shouting the word "fire" is protected speech, but the shouter is liable for inciting a panic if one ensues.
1.5.6.10.4. Con: -> See 1.5.6.1.1.
1.5.6.11. Pro: In the 21st century, the Internet has become so central to public discourse that being able to use it is necessary for having freedom of speech.
1.5.6.11.1. Pro: The same principle applies here as in net neutrality: Since the Internet has de facto become the [public square](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/06/attack-net-neutrality-attack-free-speech) in which all public debate takes place, companies have an obligation to not discriminate who can participate in that discourse based on content.
1.5.6.12. Con: -> See 1.5.6.10.3.
1.5.7. Con: Nobody inherently 'deserves' to have their voice heard. They may choose to speak. Others may choose whether or not to listen. Nobody is owed a platform, and denying a platform is not the same thing as denying free speech.
1.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.5.6.9.2.
1.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.4.
1.5.9. Pro: The beliefs of white supremacism are [embedded](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/the-language-of-white-supremacy/542148/) in American culture; to censor those that are more explicit in their views, such that they are labelled as racists, is to misunderstand the ideology.
1.5.9.1. Pro: Recent trends in American politics, specifically within the Republican party, indicate white supremacist views moving towards the mainstream. This ideology does not exist at the fringes of American society, and hence should not be censored.
1.5.9.1.1. Pro: Trump [pandered](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/13/16140504/trump-charlottesville-white-supremacists) to white supremacists throughout his campaign, refusing to condemn them until he was completely backed into a corner. This gave helped bring white supremacists to the fore of political debate during the 2016 Presidential election.
1.5.9.1.1.1. Pro: Trump [cultivated](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/08/14/donald_trump_s_ties_to_alt_right_white_supremacists_are_extensive.html) white supremacists for years, and now sits in the White House. An ideology that has some support in the White House should not be censored, but engaged with in political discussion.
1.5.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: Donald Trump has [retweeted](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-tweets-alt-right-leader-who-praised-white-supremacist-richard-spencer-650852) alt-right figures like Richard Spencer.
1.5.9.1.1.2. Pro: [Steven Bannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon#Political_career), chief executive of Donald Trump's presidential campaign and former chief strategist and senior counsellor in the White House, ran Breitbart news, an organisation he proudly called the '[platform for the alt-right](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/magazine/breitbart-alt-right-steve-bannon.html)'.
1.5.9.1.1.2.1. Con: The conservative publication has [pushed back](http://thehill.com/media/347266-breitbart-pushes-back-on-alt-right-label) against the label that it is alt-right.
1.5.9.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Regardless of what Bannon has said since coming under fire, Breitbart has certainly given extremely favourable coverage to the alt-right, including this [glowing profile of the movement](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/) written in 2016.
1.5.9.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Racist people can claim that they are not racist, that does not change the fact that they are. A buzzfeed [expose](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/10/06/breitbart-expos%C3%A9-confirms-far-right-news-site-platform-white-nationalist-alt-right) of the inner workings of Breitbart solidifies the far-right outlet’s reputation as a platform for the white nationalist “alt-right.”
1.5.9.1.1.2.2. Pro: Under Bannon's leadership, the site published an article that [celebrated](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/) the work of several white supremacists, including Richard Spencer, who was one of the leaders of the Charlottesville rally and who made [headlines](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/alt-right-salutes-donald-trump.html?_r=0) for using Nazi slogans and gestures at a Washington celebration of Trump's inauguration.
1.5.9.1.1.2.3. Pro: Bannon has [reportedly praised](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/03/16/steve_bannon_is_at_it_again_and_by_it_we_mean_nazism.html) a far-right French writer named Charles Maurras who was sentenced to life in prison after World War II for collaboration with Nazi occupiers.
1.5.9.1.1.2.4. Con: The alt-right is [not a monolithic or cohesive movement](https://therationalists.org/2016/03/23/an-honest-look-at-the-alt-right/) and in fact has many different groups within that range from moderate to extremist viewpoints. It is therefore not appropriate to conflate Bannon with the more extremist group.
1.5.9.1.1.2.4.1. Con: The article linked in the above claim itself states that the most common thread running through the alt-right is white nationalism. Even if Bannon does not associate with the most extreme alt-right tendencies, it is still fairly damning that he would associate with such an ideology at all.
1.5.9.1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: White identitarianism is of course no different from the other identitarian movements that surged out of the left. When even one group begins an identitarian movement based on race, like BLM, then the logical conclusion would be that everyone will want an identitarian movement as well including white people. The fact is that Bannon is [not willing](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40958329) to associate himself with the farther right wing movements, it is therefore unfair to categorize him as such.
1.5.9.1.1.2.4.2. Con: Bannon has [repeatedly and publicly endorsed](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/03/06/steve_bannon_and_the_camp_of_the_saints.html) The Camp of the Saints, a novel popular in white-pride circles in which black Americans, "dirty Arabs," and feces-eating Hindu rapists \(among others\) destroy civilization.
1.5.9.1.1.2.4.2.1. Con: He never endorsed it, not even in the link provided, he simply mentions it as an analogy for the crisis in Europe.
1.5.9.1.1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: He [compared](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/03/06/steve_bannon_and_the_camp_of_the_saints.html) the refugees flooding to Europe as feces-eating, dark-skinned immigrants overrunning "the white world." It's not about endorsing the book as much as it is about being explicitly racist and white nationalist.
1.5.9.1.1.2.4.3. Con: When "[moderate](http://This type of assistance will not necessarily always be readily accessible or affordable to suffering women.)" views include racial purity, antisemitism, and "white genocide" then they're not really moderate at all. The alt-right exists on a spectrum from extreme to very extreme viewpoints.
1.5.9.1.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Many segments of the alt-right do fear a white genocide or at the very least [racism against white people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp0uq-QafYQ).
1.5.9.1.1.2.5. Con: Bannon was [eventually fired](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/steve-bannon-chief-strategist-breitbart-forced-out-resigned-fired-president-donald-trump-white-house-a7901841.html) from his position in the White House.
1.5.9.1.1.2.5.1. Con: Bannon was fired [due to](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/18/16145188/steve-bannon-fired-resigns) internal friction with other members of the administration, not his white nationalist beliefs.
1.5.9.1.1.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.1.1.2.4.2.
1.5.9.1.1.3. Pro: 31 percent of Americans [believe](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-poll-white-nationalism-support-charlottesville-alt-right-more-americans-believe-president-in-a7896981.html) Trump supports white nationalism, a subset of the broader white supremacy ideology. Censoring an ideology that nearly a third of Americans believe is supported by the President would not be democratic.
1.5.9.1.1.4. Con: Even with their "dogwhistles" for political support, candidates like Donald Trump are still far removed in ideology from the types of groups internet companies consider banning, such as the Daily Stormer.
1.5.9.1.1.4.1. Pro: Trump [strongly supports Israel](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/mike-pence-israel-visit-jerusalem-trump-backlash-embassy-netanyahu-a8173301.html) and has [Jewish staffers](https://www.timesofisrael.com/white-supremacists-dont-know-what-to-make-of-jared-kushner/) in high places in the White House. This is very different from the Daily Stormer's [constant anti-semitism](https://donotlink.it/Rqnx).
1.5.9.1.1.4.2. Pro: Even if it was late, Trump has [openly condemned White Supremacists](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/14/trump-doj-has-opened-civil-rights-investigation-into-virginia-car-attack.html).
1.5.9.1.2. Pro: Trump's election win [emboldened](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-a-white-supremacist-told-me-after-donald-trump-was-elected) many white supremacists, as they feel he condones - even supports - white supremacy. Regardless of whether this is true, white supremacists cite Trump in their rhetoric and continue to draw parallels between his and their beliefs.
1.5.9.1.2.1. Pro: Trump's history of [racist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/01/11/trumps-candidacy-and-presidency-have-been-laced-with-racist-rhetoric/?utm_term=.fa4705ea5269) rhetoric is [praised](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-shithole-comment-white-nationalists-praise-779958) by white supremacists.
1.5.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: Trump opened his campaign referring to a large portion of Mexicans as [criminals and rapists.](http://time.com/4473972/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-insult/)
1.5.9.1.2.1.2. Pro: Long before the election Donald Trump espoused racist views, including his taking out of a full page ad calling for the death penalty for the [Central Park Five](http://theweek.com/articles/653840/donald-trumps-30year-crusade-against-central-park-five).
1.5.9.1.2.2. Con: The fact that white supremacists support an individual does not in itself make that individual a white supremacist. The KKK has [supported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/29/for-decades-the-ku-klux-klan-openly-endorsed-candidates-for-political-office/?utm_term=.8c381887d169) a number of candidates in its history many of which have not been white supremacists themselves, such as Ronald Reagan.
1.5.9.1.3. Pro: Roy Moore had [close ties](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/12/9/1722666/-Direct-Roy-Moore-Ties-To-White-Supremacist-Groups-Linked-To-Domestic-Terrorism) to white supremacist groups, claimed that America was great during the slavery era, and has argued that Muslims should not be allowed to sit in Congress. Despite these links to white supremacist groups and [ideological similarities with the group](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/11/16761348/roy-moore-racism-sexism), Moore won the Republican primary in Alabama and barely lost the run-off to his Democratic opponent.
1.5.9.1.4. Pro: Steve Bannon has declared an [open war](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/09/11/stephen-bannon-is-threatening-to-blow-up-the-republican-party/?utm_term=.881249ea15a1) against the GOP, threatening to unseat all those Senators in 2018 he thinks won't back Trump's agenda. Crucially, he backed Roy Moore in Alabama, and plans on running more candidates like him, who have ties to white supremacy. An ideology with such presence in the American political landscape is not something that should be censored, but rather should be engaged with.
1.5.9.1.5. Con: Polls indicate that [roughly 10%](https://www.reconsidermedia.com/lastestblogposts/finally-an-estimate-of-the-size-of-the-alt-right-movement-5nbxa) of the United States population identifies as "alt-right" \(even fewer identify as white supremacist\). It is important to remember that during the Obama presidency even more Americans \([roughly 13%](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/02/no-12-million-americans-dont-believe-the-country-is-run-by-shape-shifting-lizards/)\) indicated that Barrack Obama was the antichrist. The size of the "alt-right" and white supremacist movement does not mean it isn't at the fringes of American society, or in itself warrant engagement.
1.5.9.2. Con: Censoring white supremacists for their explicit racism is still valid; the degree to which a belief is embedded in a culture, and the number of people who hold to that belief, is not a reason to allow such beliefs to perpetuate.
1.5.9.2.1. Con: Regardless of the size of the white supremacist movement, the number of supporters, in liberal democracies, has to be a reason to listen to view points to some extent. This is because to actively block them becomes difficult once they reach critical mass. As more people perpetuate a belief, actions to silence them become pointless and can only give them the rhetorical weapon of status as an oppressed group to new potential recruits.
1.5.9.2.1.1. Pro: A failure to discuss the issues of relevance to voters results in a misapprehension of voter sentiment. Stopping discussion of real issues does not change people's standpoint on those issues. Voters who cannot air their views in public will instead do so in the voting booth where they have perfect anonymity and right to do so.
1.5.9.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.9.2.1.1.
1.5.9.3. Pro: Before the 1960s, many American politicians openly advocated white supremacy. These beliefs have not disappeared; they have simply begun to use a level of [symbolic remove](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/donald-trump-white-supremacy-and-the-discourse-of-panic.html), and still hold wide-spread appeal in America.
1.5.9.3.1. Pro: Much of the opposition towards Barack Obama was [based](https://www.thoughtco.com/blatant-acts-of-racism-against-obama-2834896) on his race: those who believed in Obama not being an American were almost [entirely](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/29/16713664/trump-obama-birth-certificate) white, mostly Republican, and reported high levels of racial resentment. The birther movement became a cover for racist opposition towards an African American President.
1.5.9.3.2. Pro: The Ku Klux Klan had major traction in many American communities for most of the 20th century. On August 8th, 1925, the Klan organized [one of the largest marches on the capital](https://qz.com/887192/the-largest-marches-on-washington-dc-topped-one-million-people/) in American history.
1.5.9.4. Pro: The Republican electoral coalition after the 1960s was partly based on [opposition](https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2016/8/30/12697920/race-dividing-american-politics) to the civil rights laws that Democrats had passed: Republicans capitalised on white frustration with issues such as housing and school desegregation. This anger and resentment is still alive today, and is nothing but a subtler form of white supremacism.
1.5.9.4.1. Pro: The civil rights laws created a [backlash](https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2016/8/30/12697920/race-dividing-american-politics) among Southern white Democratic conservatives and Northern working-class whites who were most directly affected by them. A historical coalition based on opposition to laws institutionalising equality between whites and people of colour is a coalition based on white supremacist beliefs.
1.6. Pro: Censoring any view from the market place of ideas limits public debate and thus undermines the democratic process.
1.6.1. Pro: [Suppressing free speech encourages extremism](https://thoughtcatalog.com/joshua-goldberg/2014/11/why-censoring-speech-creates-extremists-and-causes-atrocities-instead-of-stopping-them/) by establishing echo chambers where we only hear the opinions we agree with. Such environments result in groupthink, where no one is free to think outside the confines of the hive mind, resulting in self-reinforcing purity spirals that crush Freedom of Thought.
1.6.2. Con: Forcing a communication platform or online publication to include speech they don't support goes against their freedom of speech.
1.6.3. Con: The market place has no requirement to be democratic.
1.6.4. Pro: People should be able to judge the quality of different ideas for themselves and then choose the best ones, not be told by Internet companies what is acceptable.
1.6.4.1. Pro: The freedom to explore good and bad ideas and to be exposed to and fully informed by the source material is vital to making informed decisions.
1.6.4.2. Pro: What constitutes a good or bad idea is not up to democratic majority or peer-pressured by society.
1.6.4.3. Con: The public aren't the best judge of much of anything, while each person may specialise in a certain or select few academic fields the vast majority of society doesn't and can't be expected to meet the same level of expertise as world leading scholars and institutions.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Censoring people from ideas you do not think they can handle infantilizes them.
1.6.4.4.1. Con: White supremacists actively threaten, and carry out acts of violence, [against](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/26/opinions/white-supremacy-is-terrorism-ifill-opinion/index.html) minorities. It is not infantilising to protect minorities from such people and their speech.
1.6.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.
1.6.4.5. Con: It is not always a case of 'choosing' ideas; the presence of white supremacism actively crowds out minorities and prevents them from speaking.
1.6.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.11.3.
1.6.4.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.
1.6.4.6. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.
1.6.5. Pro: Excluding certain ideas from the public debate makes it difficult to engage with or refute them.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Driving unpopular views underground only strengthens them. We should allow bad ideas to be exposed to the light of public scrutiny.
1.6.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.
1.6.7. Con: White supremacist speech doesn't contribute to, and sometimes even undermines, democratic debate.
1.6.7.1. Pro: Radical groups use factually false arguments to freely manipulate public opinion and therefore undermine democracy, especially if there is no way to sue against false claims.
1.6.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.
1.6.7.1.2. Pro: US president Donald Trumps consistently uses [blatantly false statements](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) to stoke fear of immigrants and people of colour.
1.6.7.2. Con: Controversial idea's are the very essence of public debate. White supremacists bad ideas need to be heard, so one can distinguish them from good idea's.
1.6.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.12.5.
1.6.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.11.
1.6.7.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.4.
1.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.2.1.1.
1.6.9. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.7.3.
1.6.10. Pro: Censorship is inherently biased, as it is a decision based on a person's opinion; it is undemocratic to have one opinion dictating how others should think.
1.6.10.1. Con: If there is a broad mutual consensus that a group or idea is extremely damaging in any way, then censorship can be justified; the decision from Internet companies to censor white supremacists was preceded by extensive campaigning and canvassing of opinion.
1.6.10.1.1. Pro: This is termed 'the politics of consensus', referring to mainstream political thinking, and taking into account the 'body of opinion to which it is believed most reasonable citizens subscribe'. Under this thinking, white supremacy is outside the consensus, and so can be censored. \([Censorship: A World Encylopaedia](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gDqsCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2395&lpg=PA2395&dq=censoring+non+mainstream+views&source=bl&ots=_6CT4nMvZJ&sig=eoggWYtLFUY5ddoiLORyTrvE_Yg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiN07jZ1v_XAhULLsAKHdpaDD0Q6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&q=censoring%20non%20mainstream%20views&f=false), p. 2395\)
1.6.10.1.2. Con: Even a large mutual consensus cannot guarantee fairness; minority groups may be outnumbered, even if their voices deserve to be heard.
1.6.10.1.3. Con: There is no wide-spread consensus that white supremacism should be censored.
1.6.10.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.
1.6.10.1.4. Con: Morals should not be exclusively based on the majority consensus; if this were the case, many developments in social liberties would likely have collapsed. Minority viewpoints must always be considered on their merits, not quantity of supporters.
1.6.10.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.5.1.1.
1.6.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.3.1.
1.6.11. Con: The democratic process in representative democracies is one where the debates to change laws are had by representatives of the citizenry, not the citizenry themselves. Thus - online debates in a public forum, such as this one, do not form part of the democratic process.
1.6.11.1. Con: Unless people are allowed to freely express themselves on all platforms and influence and convince others of their beliefs, their ability to elect representatives is limited. This is nothing short of skewing the democratic process against groups not allowed to use these online platforms.
1.6.11.2. Con: -> See 1.5.9.2.1.1.
1.6.11.3. Con: Even in representative democracy, online debates are part of the democratic process as citizens representatives ought to represent citizens' debates and viewpoints, which includes such online debates.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.
1.9. Con: It is in the interest of Internet companies to deny services to white supremacists.
1.9.1. Con: Internet companies risk assuming liability for any and all user content if they make a practice of censoring white supremacists. They can no longer claim to be neutral conduits for information expressed by users.
1.9.1.1. Con: Any type of censorship conducted by internet companies can result in them assuming a degree of liability. The protection of people is far more important in this case.
1.9.1.2. Con: Internet companies, at least in the US, are [not legally liable](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/twitter-isis-lawsuit-dismissed/) for the content expressed on their platforms. Taking voluntary action to prevent the spread of dangerous speech is not going to change the opinion of courts on what the legal duties of internet companies are.
1.9.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.
1.9.3. Pro: By providing a platform to white supremacists, internet companies can be seen as condoning their ideology; white supremacy is not something internet companies want to have attached to their public image.
1.9.4. Pro: Users can directly attack and shame employers and founders of internet companies for providing services to white supremacists.
1.9.4.1. Con: Many white supremacists have formed organized, [well funded](https://www.google.hu/amp/s/www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/neo-nazi-sympathizers-crowdfunding/), groups that are also capable of [harassing](https://www.google.hu/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/12/03/neo-nazi-argues-that-troll-storm-against-jewish-woman-is-free-speech/) internet providers who censor them, through legal and illegal means.
1.9.4.2. Pro: Public shaming was [directed](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/08/charlottesville-employment/536838/) towards the employer of Cole White, a white supremacist who had attended the Charlottesville rally, till the employer fired White. Reputational damage aside, such public shaming can be harmful to employees at internet companies who are pressured in such a way.
1.9.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.4.3.1.
1.9.5. Con: Whether an agent commits an action in their own interest has no bearing on whether that action is right or wrong.
1.9.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.
1.9.6. Pro: Providing white supremacists with a platform to promote their views may intimidate targets of their hate into not sharing their views or leaving the platform—effectively censoring them. Thus if a company aims to host a diversity of views, censorship of some may allow for the proliferation of the many.
1.10. Pro: Internet companies are the wrong actors to decide which speech should be censored.
1.10.1. Pro: The incentives of tech companies which are primarily to increase profit and their number of public users are misaligned with bringing about the social change desired when censoring White Supremacists.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Facebook's [hate-speech rules](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms) have been reported to tend to favor elites and governments over grassroots activists and racial minorities. In doing so, they serve the business interests of the company, which relies on national governments not to block its service to their citizens.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: Facebook’s [content reviewers](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms) have deleted posts by activists and journalists in disputed territories such as Palestine, Kashmir, Crimea and Western Sahara.
1.10.2. Con: Internet companies are increasingly identifying as '[corporate citizens](https://workfamily.sas.upenn.edu/glossary/c/corporate-citizenship-definitions)', with a strong emphasis on 'corporate social responsibility'. They have the ability, and moral obligation, to positively effect society by exemplifying certain behaviours and inspire positive responses from consumers.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Particularly internet companies, with technological advances at their fingertips, have the opportunity to behave as moral agents. They can be an example of good moral behaviour to their consumers, e.g. by censoring white supremacist viewpoints.
1.10.2.2. Con: They are under no obligation to do so. Internet companies can choose to remain impartial to socio-political matters.
1.10.2.2.1. Con: If a bartender remained impartial during and after a racial attack, they would be actively be favouring the attacker and validating their behaviour. When you operate in public, you will take a side even if you claim not to.
1.10.2.3. Con: Corporate personhood is only a valid concept in America. Though corporations may believe in or enact social responsibilities in other countries, the concept of a "corporate citizen" is strongly rooted in North American culture, and so might not be applicable everywhere.
1.10.2.4. Con: Companies may be citizens, but citizens are free to make their own moral judgements on issues, meaning that they could easily disagree with any judgement on what constitutes a moral obligation or social good.
1.10.2.5. Con: [Older consumers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/datafreaks/2015/03/12/brands-take-a-stand-when-speaking-up-about-controversial-issues-hurts-or-helps-business/#a730010352d4), who comprise a huge part of the market, are less concerned about the socio-political status of the companies they engage with.
1.10.2.5.1. Con: This indicates ambivalence towards the attitude of internet companies, not an active desire for them to be neutral. This is not a reason for why internet companies should not exert their influence.
1.10.2.5.2. Con: Not caring about the position of internet companies on certain issues does not preclude older citizens from being positively influenced by the actions of internet companies.
1.10.2.6. Pro: This is particularly pertinent for groups targeting [younger consumers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/datafreaks/2015/03/12/brands-take-a-stand-when-speaking-up-about-controversial-issues-hurts-or-helps-business/#a730010352d4), who tend to be more affected by the socio-political status of large companies.
1.10.2.6.1. Pro: A [higher percentage](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/opinion/sunday/the-power-of-ceo-activism.html?_r=1) of young consumers would buy from Apple when informed of their political position compared to those who did not. Apple have already made several moves to [combat white supremacy](http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/08/16/apple-disables-apple-pay-for-websites-selling-white-supremacist-goods) and are increasing their consumer base whilst still remaining morally consistent.
1.10.2.7. Pro: Individuals are perfectly happy to introduce politics into business: a 2017 survey in the US indicated that [68% of respondents](http://uk.businessinsider.com/private-companies-politics-2017-8?r=US&IR=T) believe it is "important for corporations to take a stand on important political issues".
1.10.2.8. Pro: This is not exclusive to white supremacist censorship: Twitter have blocked advertising revenue from two Kremlin-backed companies. In an indication of their commitment to moralisation, they are [donating advertising revenue](https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/twitter-bans-kremlin-backed-news-outlets-roger-stone.html) from those companies into "research\[ing\] fake news and the civil impact of Twitter". If all companies were to do similarly for white supremacists, this would be a huge moral leap forward.
1.10.2.9. Con: [Studies are divided](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0267257X.2014.974658) on how far this positive effect extends. It is not a particularly well-researched area, and further information is needed to state categorically what the positive impacts are.
1.10.2.9.1. Con: Internet companies should still positively influence the people they can; this influence does not need to extend to all of society for it to be a worthwhile endeavour.
1.10.2.9.2. Con: The moral obligation on internet companies exists regardless of how many people are influenced by their actions.
1.10.3. Con: Consumers both want and expect these companies to respond actively, particularly those claiming to be '[values-orientated](https://www.fastcompany.com/3067944/political-neutrality-can-be-costly)'. This makes them the right parties to make such decisions.
1.10.3.1. Con: For companies who are '[results-based](https://www.fastcompany.com/3067944/political-neutrality-can-be-costly)' - adapting to the market situation rather than acting upon a given set of values - taking a political stand was detrimental, indicating that consumers weren't interested in them taking public stands on political issues.
1.10.3.2. Pro: If a company is '[guided by core values](https://www.fastcompany.com/3067944/political-neutrality-can-be-costly)', consumers find it hypocritical if they abstain from opinion; it is read as 'deceptive' by the consumer.
1.10.3.3. Pro: Uber did not respond emphatically to Trump's executive order regarding immigration; the inaction seemed to contradict the company's [purported ideals](https://www.uber.com/en-GB/our-story/), and led to such [widespread removal](https://www.fastcompany.com/3067944/political-neutrality-can-be-costly) of the app that they had to develop a new automated process to handle the deletions.
1.10.3.4. Pro: In 2014, the Southern Poverty Law Center published a list of white supremacist hate bands that were available on the iTunes platform. This led to Apple removing them from the software. More recently, Spotify was [singled out](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2017/08/14/white-supremacist-hate-spotify/) as still hosting these bands, after which they removed them from their platform as well.
1.10.3.5. Pro: The decision to censor white supremacists was ultimately made because of [public pressure](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-17/facebook-airbnb-go-on-offense-against-neo-nazis-after-violence): internet companies only censored white supremacy because people wanted them to censor it.
1.10.3.5.1. Pro: GoDaddy dropped the neo-nazi Daily Stormer from its services [in response](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-registration-site-godaddy-delists-neo-nazi-site-in-wake-of-charlottesville-violence/2017/08/14/3edcdd14-811a-11e7-902a-2a9f2d808496_story.html?utm_term=.0dfd714e8994) to an appeal from a Twitter user.
1.10.3.5.2. Pro: After nearly a year of [pressure from activists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/web-registration-site-godaddy-delists-neo-nazi-site-in-wake-of-charlottesville-violence/2017/08/14/3edcdd14-811a-11e7-902a-2a9f2d808496_story.html?utm_term=.0dfd714e8994), payment processor PayPal and Patreon canceled accounts for some right-wing figures.
1.10.3.5.3. Pro: The Color of Change launched a website called '[Blood Money](http://bloodmoney.org)', which highlights how credit-card companies online profit from white supremacists, and lobbies for them to take action. Many companies have therefore dropped or banned white supremacists from using their companies.
1.10.3.6. Pro: [79% of Americans](http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/07/11/the-broader-context-of-online-harassment/) believe that Internet companies have a responsibility to step in when harassing behaviour occurs, giving Internet companies the power and expectation from consumers to deal with it appropriately.
1.10.3.6.1. Con: Pre-emptively removing white supremacists from their platforms and removing them when they have actively harassed someone are two entirely different things. The latter is justifiable as it involves protecting vulnerable people, the former is judging someone to be guilty before they have even done anything.
1.10.3.6.2. Con: Not all white supremacists harass people; removing those who engage in harassment is simply not the same as removing all white supremacists.
1.10.4. Pro: Momentous decisions such as taking away someone's freedom of speech can only be made by democratically legitimised actors, not private companies.
1.10.4.1. Con: Democratically legitimised institutions lack the resources to actually make and implement such decisions. Private companies are the only actors equipped to implement them, so they should do so.
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: State authorities lack the necessary financial resources for efficient Internet monitoring, which can be incredibly [expensive](http://certmag.com/the-great-firewall-how-china-polices-internet-traffic/). Private companies are in a [better financial position.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/21/the-guardian-view-on-censoring-the-internet-necessary-but-not-easy)
1.10.4.1.1.1. Con: China has, arguably, [managed to do so](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/25/asia/china-internet-censorship-kristie-lu-stout/index.html): the government remains in absolute control of content, and Internet companies in the area are thriving.
1.10.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that one country can do this does not mean all countries have the ability to do so.
1.10.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: In China, around two million people are employed as censors, known as '[public opinion analysts](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/07/world/asia/china-internet-monitors/)'; this keeps citizens in employment, sustaining their economy, and also illustrates that it is financially viable to exert such control if desired.
1.10.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If the aim of such censorship is to protect liberty, China with its record of [violation of fundamental freedoms](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/china-cracks-down-dissent-tiananmen-anniversary) is hardly the country to follow.
1.10.4.1.2. Pro: Governments have a limited amount of time on their hand, which should be spent on combatting real crimes rather than offensive speech. Internet companies can take care of the latter.
1.10.4.1.3. Pro: Many governments lack the [digital expertise](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/07/19/lack-of-digital-talent-adds-to-cybersecurity-problems/?utm_term=.18f7c46ad937) that would be necessary for effectively combatting censorship online.
1.10.4.1.3.1. Pro: Given the significantly [higher salaries](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cybersecurity-dhs/homeland-security-struggles-to-tempt-retain-cyber-talent-idUSBREA3P05O20140426) in the private sector, experts in cyber policy or security rarely choose to work in government jobs.
1.10.4.1.4. Pro: [Private companies](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/how-companies-are-using-big-data-and-analytics) have been making great strides in big data analytics and artificial intelligence, which could both be employed in the service of effectively censoring hate speech.
1.10.4.1.5. Con: Private companies, especially on a mainstream media platform, controlling public discourse to suit their company mission and political narrative is not only legally dubious but potentially catastrophically dangerous.
1.10.4.2. Pro: Even if there were laws on what content to censor, there will always be grey areas, where the censors need to make judgement calls. Internet companies are not democratically empowered to make these judgement calls.
1.10.4.2.1. Con: There are grey areas in any moral issue. This does not excuse a company's failure to address them.
1.10.4.3. Pro: The definition of white supremacy is fluid and like all equality and discrimination issues is dependent on the view of the recipient. Non-elected and unrepresentative bodies such as internet providers decide on definitions arbitrarily based on external claims both real and vexatious. There is a risk of curtailing any discussion of a white cultural nature in the future based on false perception, innuendo or malice.
1.10.4.4. Con: By using their website, more people have arguably agreed to e.g. behave in accordance with Facebook's terms of service than have agreed to abide by the laws of any single country.
1.10.4.5. Con: By definition, one does not necessarily have freedom of speech in a private forum.
1.10.4.5.1. Con: One can qualify social media as crossing the line from the private sphere to the public, placing the company in the civil domain, entitled to a number of powers and rights as administrator but ultimately answerable to civil law.
1.10.4.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.1.1.
1.10.4.6. Con: Declining to assist someone in expressing their ideas is not the same thing as denying them freedom of speech. There are many outlets for public discourse. A government can make laws to stop speech with which it disagrees. An internet company has no such absolute power; it can't stop ideas it prohibits from being published elsewhere. It's not the disapproval of certain ideas by individual companies that should worry us, but blanket governmental censorship.
1.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.
1.10.6. Con: Companies like Facebook - with over two billion users - are larger than any single government. With such wide reach, it would [be negligent](https://qz.com/989416/facebook-has-a-government-size-censorship-responsibility-without-the-structure-to-handle-it/) for them to enforce no censorship, due to the extreme negative social impact this may have.
1.10.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.
1.10.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.1.1.
1.10.6.3. Con: -> See 1.10.4.2.
1.10.7. Pro: With large companies, it is hard to remain internally consistent: [YouTube](https://theconversation.com/the-responsibilities-of-social-media-companies-over-free-speech-9632) has a ban on violent videos, but makes exceptions for some videos showing human rights abuses \(which, by their nature, may contain violence\). This indicates the difficulty in 'fairly and consistently arbitrat\[ing\] free speech'.
1.10.7.1. Pro: Any censorship risks over-blocking sites that are perfectly acceptable. In Australia, for example, a list aimed to tackle child pornography [incorrectly blocked](http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/web-blacklists-innocent-victims/news-story/4e15e924734b0b378ea4871302c2ed00?nk=9bda6ec104eda5c8fc288d1cf5d56223-1513807068) a dentist, tuckshop and kennel.
1.11. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.
1.12. Pro: Denying service to white supremacists might lead to extensive online censorship of non-mainstream views.
1.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.1.1.
1.12.2. Pro: The decision of who falls into what political group leaves room for false association. In other words the rights of others could be unfairly restricted due to being incorrectly labelled as white supremacists.
1.12.2.1. Con: Online platforms are not targeting groups but rather content.
1.12.3. Con: Companies are only likely to censor non-mainstream views which are harmful.
1.12.3.1. Pro: Companies have no reason to ban non-mainstream views that are not harmful. Doing so just leads to fewer users and less traffic for no good reason at all.
1.12.3.1.1. Pro: Losing users is harmful to companies as that makes them lose advertisement revenues.
1.12.3.2. Con: Once companies start bowing to public opinion or political pressures in democratic countries \(such as the USA\), it will be much more difficult not to agree with censorship demands in authoritarian counties such as Turkey, China or Russia.
1.12.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.3.
1.12.3.2.2. Con: It is unclear why companies will have to or will be likelier to do this. Companies can still pick and choose which views to censor.
1.12.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.8.1.2.
1.12.3.2.4. Con: Companies can hold an ideologically consistent position that they, and they alone, determine which content is allowed on their site. They can be happy to listen to arguments as to what should or shouldn't be allowed, but they won't obey orders, from "the public" or from a government. It isn't a logical given that willingness to self censor makes accepting imposed censorship more likely.
1.12.3.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.3.7.
1.12.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.1.3.2.5.3.2.
1.12.4. Pro: Since the decision which content to censor is entirely up to the Internet companies' discretion, nothing will stop them from denying services to other groups they disagree with.
1.12.4.1. Pro: The process for the deletion of content or accounts, and for appealing those decisions, is extremely [intransparent](https://alexaobrien.com/archives/3647) and difficult to navigate.
1.12.4.2. Con: Internet companies can presumably already do this; banning white supremacist speech will have no bearing on their decision to ban other speech.
1.12.4.3. Pro: Internet companies are in a position where they can secretly censor anything they like. Such a lack of transparency makes it reasonable for consumers to be concerned about the extent and bias of this unknown censorship.
1.12.4.3.1. Pro: Facebook has been challenged for how it [mediates the news articles](https://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006) users see in the "trending news" section. Employees suppressed news that was either right-wing or critical of Facebook, and artificially promoted left-wing news, rather than accurately collecting actual "trending" news.
1.12.4.4. Pro: Some Internet companies are already censoring non-extremist views.
1.12.4.4.1. Con: If doing so falls within the company's bylaws, code of ethics, and does not violate a fiduciary duty, suppressing conservative views--or any other set of views--is the reasonable right of Google's management within their corporate purview.
1.12.4.4.1.1. Con: The main claim does not say that internet companies should not have the right to censor speech, but that they should not censor speech. Google's policy may be wrong, which is the subject of this overall debate.
1.12.4.4.2. Pro: [James Damore](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/08/google-fires-employee-behind-anti-diversity-memo-perpetuating/) published a 3,000-word [memo](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/15/tech-companies-block-neo-nazi-groups-charlottesville-rally/) titled "Google's ideological echo chamber" where he claimed conservative views are suppressed in the tech company, and was subsequently fired for it.
1.12.4.4.2.1. Con: This '[echo-chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber)' was about the need for diversity, and the belief that biological differences between men and women did not affect their ability to serve as employees of Google. This is hardly an echo-chamber; if anything, it is trying to make the tech world a more comfortable space for women.
1.12.4.4.2.1.1. Con: It is an echo chamber because it prioritized ethnic and sexual diversity over ideological diversity. James Damore did not even criticize the goal of Google's diversity program \(making women feel safer\), but disagreed with its methodology and core beliefs, as well as suggesting other ways to promote diversity. He was fired, more or less proving his own point.
1.12.4.4.2.1.1.1. Con: By keeping Damore, Google would have allowed the spread of gender stereotypes that threatened female inclusivity, or they could have fired him which, while shutting out the opinion that females are worse engineers than males, made women more comfortable. Google was in a [double bind](https://www.wired.com/story/google-manifesto-puts-executives-in-a-bind/) where they had to choose between the two. The fact that Google prioritised one over the other is not relevant, as it would have to pick one either way.
1.12.4.4.2.1.1.2. Con: Damore argued in favour of [harmful](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/google-fires-engineer-who-crossed-the-line-with-diversity-memo/) gender stereotypes. It is completely acceptable for Google to prioritise protecting its female employees over an ideology that would have harmed a sizeable portion of its workforce.
1.12.4.4.2.2. Con: There is a difference between the ideological make-up of Google's employees and the ideological diversity of the views it hosts. Just because the former may be restricted does not mean the latter is.
1.12.4.4.2.2.1. Con: Although this is true, there is plenty of evidence that conservative viewpoints are being discriminated against on platforms like Youtube. [PragerU](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/prageru-sues-youtube-says-it-censors-conservative-videos/) is fighting a lawsuit about deleted videos, and many moderates and conservatives like [Dave Rubin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4D0TBPd3JU) are being demonetized for apparently political reasons.
1.12.4.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Youtube's strategy equally affects content creators associated with the [opposite end](https://theoutline.com/post/2258/youtube-is-leaving-its-creators-in-the-dark) of the political spectrum, e.g. by restricting access to [feminist and queer content](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/prageru-sues-youtube-says-it-censors-conservative-videos/).
1.12.4.4.2.2.1.2. Con: Certain groups believing Youtube and other platforms censor conservative views isn't proof of these platforms actually censoring such views. Anyone can file a lawsuit; they need to win for the argument to stand.
1.12.4.5. Pro: Permitting discrimination based on belief endorses discrimination and establishes precedent that gives companies like Facebook and Kialo license to refuse service to groups like Jews, Republicans, Feminists, or Communists.
1.12.4.6. Pro: As can be seen by [OK Cupid's](http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/08/okcupid-bans-white-supremacist-chris-cantwell.html) decision to suspend the account of Christopher Cantwell - a violent white supremacist who gained a degree of notoriety after the Charlottesville riots - Internet companies may censor individuals in contexts where there is no clear or apparent harm.
1.12.5. Con: It is unlikely that constitutionally-protected free speech will be eroded by denial-of-service policies that are strictly limited to targeting unlawful hate speech or promotion of ongoing lawless action, both of which are illegal and characteristic of white supremacist ideology.
1.12.6. Con: Censoring non-mainstream views may not be a bad thing; if this extended into sites like [Return of Kings](http://www.returnofkings.com/) - a legendarily misogynistic, male supremacist, racist proponent of extensive hate speech - it would indicate a broad rejection of such viewpoints, with a corresponding positive impact on society.
1.12.6.1. Con: The fact that sites like the one cited are not considered mainstream indicates the broad rejection of their viewpoints. Censoring them would instead signal complete rejection of their viewpoints, which is clearly inaccurate since people both visit and create such sites.
1.12.6.2. Pro: Men's rights activism - as seen on sites like Return of Kings - has been cited as a "[gateway drug](https://www.thecut.com/2017/08/mens-rights-activism-is-the-gateway-drug-for-the-alt-right.html)" for Alt-Right views and white supremacy. Suspending such sites could be very effective in restricting the development of white supremacist views.
1.12.7. Pro: Authorities already [censor legal material](http://www.thegreatdebate.org.uk/GDIntFreeProc.html) on the Internet, and this cannot be permitted to continue nor spread. If it is legal, there is no valid justification for removal.
1.12.7.1. Pro: The [Internet Watch Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Watch_Foundation) \(IWF\) removes a substantial amount of information, often [invisibly](https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Internet_Watch_Foundation), and with little or no appeals process.
1.12.7.1.1. Pro: The Internet Watch Foundation draws up blacklists, which British ISPs rely on for blocking inappropriate or mature content. This has indirectly conferred on the IWF the power to determine which content will be censored.
1.12.7.2. Pro: The risk is in the potential normalisation of censorship. Legally, enhanced surveillance and censorship laws tend to be legislated one by one, rather than all at once. In practice, censorship is permitted to grow, [year on year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_the_United_Kingdom), without an appropriate degree of [transparency](https://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/dcssproject/files/2015/11/Public-Feeling-on-Privacy-Security-Surveillance-DATAPSST-DCSS-Nov2015.pdf).
1.12.8. Con: Criminalizing and denying service to pedophilia material online has not led to widespread suppression of other forms of speech.
1.12.8.1. Con: [Australia has banned pornography](https://www.crikey.com.au/2010/01/29/has-australia-really-banned-small-breasts/) wherein adult actors portray characters who are under-18, or whose actors appear under-18, regardless of the real ages of actors. This shows that governments can stretch the definition of censored subjects to expand the list of censored material without a full public discussion.
1.12.9. Con: There is as yet no evidence for this slippery slope. If there is a further move in the future to censor another, less harmful form of speech, then we should consider that situation when it arises on its own merits.
1.12.9.1. Con: Censorship can be conducted invisibly, through a practise known as [shadow banning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banning). Internet companies have few obligations to be transparent in their censorship, and so it is feasible for them to censor as they wish without common knowledge.
1.12.9.1.1. Pro: [Twitter](https://www.basecreative.co.uk/opinion/shadowbanning/) and [Instagram](https://later.com/blog/instagram-shadowban/) are known to shadowban extensively.
1.12.9.1.2. Pro: In 2017, Youtube introduced Restricted Mode, which simply delisted LGBTQ* related content since it had arbitrarily been classified "[mature](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/19/youtube-updates-its-policies-after-lgbtq-videos-were-blocked-in-restricted-mode/)".
1.12.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.8.
1.12.9.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.5.2.5.6.1.2.2.3.4.3.1.
1.12.10. Pro: Internet companies, by censoring white supremacists, can inspire vigilante hackers to take down websites that they personally disagree with. It is exactly this form of censorship, undertaken by private entities, that should be avoided.
1.12.10.1. Pro: Vigilante 'doxxers' traced individuals from the Charlottesville rallies, published their names and addresses, and put pressure on employers to fire any such individuals. Several lost their jobs. This is [not acceptable](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/08/thinking-strategically-about-free-speech-and-violence); what people elect to do in their free time should not be grounds for dismissal in a work context, and it is not the job of random individuals to dictate another's livelihood.
1.12.10.2. Pro: In response to the Indian government blocking file-sharing websites, the group Anonymous India [hacked into more than 15 sites](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18371297), including the Indian Supreme Court, two political parties and the Indian telecoms providers. It is easy to imagine such hacking efforts being made to support censorship as well.
1.12.10.3. Pro: The post-Charlottesville censorship included a good amount of [vigilante hacking](https://www.buzzfeed.com/pranavdixit/godaddy-has-kicked-white-supremacist-website-the-daily?utm_term=.pevdZJAy1#.maz2wPbWj). Anonymous \(allegedly\) hacked "The Daily Stormer", "Red Ice" was hacked and its users threatened with doxxing. There is a definite link between increased censorship from Internet companies and subsequent action from individual hackers.
