Discussion Title: Is the Muppet Christmas Carol the best Muppet Movie?

1. Muppet Christmas Carol is the best Muppet Movie.
1.1. Con: The Chicago Tribune, Dave Kehr reviewed the film as "a talky, plodding film that seems likely to bore children and adults in equal measure."
1.1.1. Con: One review of the film does not mean it is the only opinion, professional or otherwise.
1.1.2. Con: This seems to contradict the bulk of opinion, rendering it perhaps simply incorrect.
1.2. Pro: Michael Cane gives one of the best depictions of Ebenezer Scrooge.
1.3. Con: Other Muppet films have different special places in other peoples' hearts; it is impossible to be objective.
1.3.1. Con: It is possible to judge a movie as objectively good or bad, not personal basis but on an aggregate basis
1.4. Pro: It is the most accurate adaptation of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens that there has ever been.
1.4.1. Con: This doesn't necessarily make it better than any other Muppets movie, however.
1.4.2. Con: There are [many other accurate adaptations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptations_of_A_Christmas_Carol), so one cannot claim that this one is the best.
1.5. Con: Its not the most profitable, with [The Muppet Movie](http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Box_office_grosses) being way out in front.
1.5.1. Con: Profitability does not equal superiority.
1.5.1.1. Pro: The only reason it didn't do so well at the box office was that it was up against Home Alone 2: Lost in New York and Disney's Aladdin.
1.6. Pro: It has some of the most memorable songs of the Muppet franchise, with AllMusic giving the soundtrack album [4.5 stars out of 5.](https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-muppet-christmas-carol-original-soundtrack-mw0000089924)
1.6.1. Pro: The soundtrack was done by [Miles Goodman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Goodman), who also did the soundtrack for Little Shop Of Horrors; Frank Oz, director of Little Shop of Horrors, voiced a variety of characters in the Muppets. Their collaboration would have contributed to the success of the soundtrack.
1.7. Pro: It was one of the last movies to be directly attributed to Jim Henson, who died during pre-production. This means it would still contain the original "magic" that is associated with the great man himself.
