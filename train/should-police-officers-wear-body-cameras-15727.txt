Discussion Title: Should Police Officers Wear Body Cameras?

1. Police officers should wear and operate body cameras during all civilian-police encounters.
1.1. Con: Police body cameras expose the faces of child victims.
1.1.1. Con: Exposure would only happen if the videos are made public.
1.1.1.1. Pro: All faces can be blurred away before publishing the videos.
1.1.2. Con: As does CCTV
1.2. Con: With the viewing angle being limited, information can be limited or misleading which would do more harm than good.
1.2.1. Pro: Helmet cameras would be much more effective and accurate. The camera is closer to the officers eyes and viewpoint.
1.2.2. Con: With no evidence showing more harm than good, the viewing angle argument is just an argument for upgrading body cameras to use wide angle lenses.
1.3. Pro: Police body cameras protect civilians from police misconduct.
1.3.1. Pro: Body cameras will record police-civilian interactions, deterring misconduct by providing strong evidence.
1.3.2. Con: A [7-month study](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/upshot/a-big-test-of-police-body-cameras-defies-expectations.html) where over 2000 police officers in Washington, D.C., were randomly assigned body cameras indicates that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of use of force or civilian complaints.
1.3.2.1. Con: The researchers speculated that it is "possible that D.C. officers are comparatively [better trained than other police forces that had been studied](http://dcist.com/2017/10/dc_body-worn_camera_studys_surprisi.php), which could account for the differing results \[compared to other studies\]".
1.3.3. Pro: A study of about [1000 police officiers for 12 months](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-014-9236-3) indicated that police-civilian relations improved.
1.3.3.1. Pro: The likelihood to use force is cut by [half](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-014-9236-3) when police officers use body cams.
1.3.3.2. Pro: [Civilian complaints](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-014-9236-3) dropped from 0.7 per 1000 contacts to 0.07 per 1000 contacts when officiers wore body cameras.
1.3.4. Con: Many police departments do not have a policy in place to [review possible officer misconduct](https://www.bwcscorecard.org/). This limits how much footage is accessible and can be used against officers.
1.3.5. Pro: The police are an instrument of the public; therefore their activities should be available to the public, within the law.
1.4. Pro: The police want body cameras.
1.4.1. Pro: [19%](https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rvnT.EAJQwK4/v0) of police departments have 'fully operational' body camera system in place already.
1.4.2. Pro: [77%](https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rvnT.EAJQwK4/v0) of police departments intend to adopt body camera systems.
1.5. Pro: Police body cameras provide courts with more clear and accurate depictions of encounters between police and civilians.
1.5.1. Pro: Mandating always on body cameras creates an environment where the expectation is of full audio/visual disclosure of police engagements which itself reinforces positive behavior change in both sides.
1.5.1.1. Pro: It makes both parties more accountable.
1.5.2. Con: Since the angle of the camera is limited information gathered from the video can be misleading or even missing.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Though the angle of one camera tells part of the story, it also provides a picture of what that particular officer saw or believed was occurring.
1.5.2.2. Con: The audio is actually more important than the video; provided the video has a reasonable field of view, it's the faithful recording of the audio that provides the important timeline of an event.
1.5.2.3. Con: Missing camera footage is of its self an indicator of shady business.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: At least the audio keeps recording regardless of angle. Some unbiased and reliable evidence is still better than everyone’s recollection.
1.5.3. Pro: Police body cams protect the officers from unfounded allegations of misconduct.
1.5.4. Pro: Video evidence from body cameras can prevent the public expense of police attendance at trials.
1.6. Pro: Body cameras protect policemen from false accusations of misconduct.
1.7. Con: People can respond violently to being filmed.
1.7.1. Con: If they're sufficiently subtle it will not provoke this type of ire.
1.7.1.1. Con: Making cameras standard issue will be publicly known so hiding them will do nothing. It is more likely to cause trouble for any police personnel not using them since civilians can't be sure whether they are being filmed or not.
1.7.2. Con: Making it mandatory to delete the video if not relevant for any ongoing investigation or after closing could be easing.
1.7.3. Con: People should not act violently in modern society, otherwise need to be pacified. People could act violently to policemen wearing firearms or being present at all just as well.
1.7.4. Con: Knowing that they are filmed inhibits aggressive behaviour as they have a harder time to dispute their behaviour.
1.7.5. Con: As do police, which is one of the reasons they should have them.
1.8. Pro: Footage from body cameras can be a unique tool to train officers on best practice and professionalism.
1.8.1. Pro: Police body cameras aids crime researchers.
1.9. Con: Police body cameras invade civilian privacy.
1.9.1. Pro: Some countries prohibit filming individuals without consent which makes it illegal in general.
1.9.1.1. Pro: [Brazil, Spain, and Switzerland](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Country_specific_consent_requirements#France) require consent for all photos involving people. In several other countries consent is only required in certain situations.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: In Switzerland, you are [still allowed to take public photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/5rekrh/photography_laws_in_switzerland/), but people in the photos have the right to ask you to obscure them or delete the photo afterwards.
1.9.1.2. Con: [Most countries](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Country_specific_consent_requirements#France) only require consent when publishing content, or using it commercially.
1.9.2. Con: All recordings can be sealed and released only with a Judicial review.
1.9.3. Con: Police themselves invade privacy, so the body cameras are significantly less of an issue.
1.9.3.1. Con: True for any person being an active part. However, any bystanders have neither say nor reason to be filmed.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: The public could be generally aware that police wear body cameras, and therefore know that if they are nearby, they are being filmed.
1.9.3.1.2. Con: The footage would then be helpful in identifying witness, which is important for later investigation.
1.9.4. Con: If the use of the recordings is well regulated \(no public broadcast unless consented\), then there should be no break of privacy.
1.9.4.1. Pro: In Washington recorded footage is automatically deleted within [90 days](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/upshot/a-big-test-of-police-body-cameras-defies-expectations.html) unless there is a special reason to keep it.
1.9.5. Con: It's perfectly legal to record videos in public because there is a thing called [reasonable expectation of privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_of_privacy), which states that people cannot reasonably expect privacy in public.
1.9.6. Pro: Confusing [privacy rules](https://www.bwcscorecard.org/) by police department make procedures intransparent.
1.9.7. Con: Security cameras are already common place, and police body cameras run along the same vein of thought. So if security is acceptable then so too should body cameras.
1.10. Con: Police body cameras are too expensive.
1.10.1. Con: If deemed necessary for the common good, no item can be considered too expensive.
1.10.2. Con: This doesn't negate their necessity, but merely means that priority for police funding ought to be addressed.
1.10.3. Con: So are prolonged legal procedures due to inconclusive evidence. Probably even more.
1.10.4. Pro: Technological gaps prevent the full implementation of body worn cameras.
1.10.4.1. Pro: [70%](https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rvnT.EAJQwK4/v0) of police departments do first need to expand their IT departments before they can implement body worn cameras.
1.10.4.2. Pro: Often there is inadequate bandwith or network capability.
1.10.4.2.1. Con: Body cameras do not need to be network connected \(ie streaming live\) to be useful, they can be offline and synchronise when docked to charge overnight, for example.
1.10.4.3. Pro: Police departments lack safe data storage opportunities.
1.10.4.4. Pro: [45%](https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rvnT.EAJQwK4/v0) of police departments do not have a clear understanding of what they actually would have to do to implement body worn cameras.
1.10.5. Con: The federal government already assigned [$40 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/upshot/a-big-test-of-police-body-cameras-defies-expectations.html) to equip police officers with body cameras.
1.10.6. Con: Given that the main manufacturer of body camera is the US based company [Axon](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/upshot/a-big-test-of-police-body-cameras-defies-expectations.html), investment into body cameras would work as stimulus package and secure the nearly [700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon_\(company\)) employees there.
1.10.7. Con: It is said in one of the [Nottinhamshire, UK](https://www.nottinghamshire.police.uk/sites/default/files/documents/files/FOI%20005829%2012%20Costs%20of%20recruiting%20and%20training%20a%20Police%20Officer%20and%20a%20Police%20Community%20Support%20Officer.pdf) police reports that on average it cost £12,900 to train a police officer and average salary for a police officer is £30,520 per annum. Compared to that camera is really cheap.
1.10.8. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
