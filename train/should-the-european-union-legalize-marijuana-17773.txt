Discussion Title: Should the European Union legalize marijuana?

1. The EU should legalize marijuana for medical and recreational use.
1.1. Con: The European Union should not interfere with policies on a national level.
1.1.1. Pro: The legalisation of drugs is not an area the EU has competency on. [eur-lex.europa.eu](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3Aai0020)
1.1.2. Pro: Too much interference by the EU in national policy may [increase Euroskepticism](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-juncker-idUSKCN0XG2MU).
1.1.3. Con: The EU [already](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/netuf/2018/08/06/warning-shots-fired-the-ecbs-recent-interference-in-national-politics/) influences national politics via the ECB's control of monetary policy.
1.2. Con: Legalizing marijuana would require a prior treaty change to give the EU the competences to legislate on marijuana policy.
1.2.1. Con: If drug legislation falls under the [Ordinary Legislative Procedures](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers), member states cannot veto a legislative proposal.
1.2.1.1. Con: From [the European Commission's website,](http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/competences/faq#q1) w/relevance to health policy: 'Legally binding EU acts in these areas cannot imply the harmonisation of national laws or regulations.' This is assuming the EC & Parliament will vote on an issue they don't have full or shared competence on.
1.2.2. Con: If drug legislation is done via the means of a [regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_\(European_Union\)), member states are forced to implement it one-to-one.
1.2.2.1. Con: From [the European Commission's website](http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/competences/faq#q1), w/relevance to health policy: 'Legally binding EU acts in these areas cannot imply the harmonisation of national laws or regulations.'
1.2.3. Con: If drug legislation is done via a [directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_%28European_Union%29), then member states are obliged to implement it in faith.
1.2.3.1. Con: [From the European Commission's website](http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/competences/faq#q1), w/relevance to health policy: 'Legally binding EU acts in these areas cannot imply the harmonisation of national laws or regulations.'
1.2.4. Pro: Drug legalisation is a reserved matter for individual member states; the countries which democratically support cannabis legalisation can do so, and those against it can do so as well. Health issues are [area of exclusive competence for the EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12016E003) \(EU makes laws\), or an [area of shared competence](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12016E004) \(EU laws have primacy\).
1.3. Pro: Criminalization of cannabis is funding the organized crime syndicates in the EU.
1.3.1. Pro: If everywhere in Europe cannabis is allowed as it is in e.g. Netherlands, the selling is controlled and out of the criminal environment.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Legalizing marijuana would strongly hit the drug market of the Italian Mafia.
1.4. Pro: Cannabis medicine is a healthier alternative to opioids.
1.4.1. Pro: The use of opioids for pain management in the US has created a [crisis](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/18/health/opioid-crisis-fast-facts/index.html) which is killing tens of thousands of individuals per year.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Some research [suggests](https://www.rti.org/infographic/prescription-drug-abuse-europe) that rates of opioid abuse in the European Union could catch up with US rates in the future.
1.4.2. Con: Opioids and cannabis are not a binary choice. One can live without either and still be healthy.
1.4.2.1. Con: There are diseases that are best treated by the use of cannabis. [Check here](https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/news/20180516/low-dose-of-cbd-oil-eases-epilepsy-seizures#1)
1.5. Pro: Restricting use of cannabis violates [bodily integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity) which is a human right.
1.6. Pro: Legalising cannabis will increase tax revenue, as it will likely not receive an exemption from VAT.
1.7. Pro: While medical marijuana is legal in one member state, people with the need for medical marijuana in another state are not being treated equally as people in legal states.
1.7.1. Pro: Legal, EU-wide medicinal marijuana would help eliminate shortages in specific states, such as when [Italy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aurora-cannabis-italy/canadas-aurora-to-sell-medical-marijuana-to-italy-idUSKBN1F72EC) was forced to buy marijuana from Canada.
1.7.2. Con: EU citizens have freedom of movement, and can travel to member states where cannabis is legal.
1.7.2.1. Con: If somebody is using cannabis medicinally for pain relief, then travel could worsen their condition.
1.8. Pro: Legalizing cannabis will create more opportunities for research to be done
1.9. Con: Cannabis can negatively impact health.
1.9.1. Pro: Smoking cannabis often requires one to consume nicotine.
1.9.1.1. Con: Legal vendors would be able to sell products that are blended with alternatives to tobacco. There would be no need to blend legal cannabis with nicotine.
1.9.1.2. Con: Alternatives to tobacco are easily available and tobacco is just a popular choice. Furthermore, the fact that it is often consumed alongside an already legal drug is not a strong argument against the legalisation of cannabis itself.
1.9.2. Con: Cannabis consumers tend to be [thinner](https://herb.co/marijuana/news/smoking-weed-lose-weight/) than non-consumers.
1.9.3. Con: Cannabis is a useful treatment for individuals with [epilepsy](https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/involved/campaigns/cannabis).
1.9.3.1. Con: Already marketed \([Sativex®](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/602/smpc)\) cannbinoids are dosed more accurately than Cannabis plant matter, rendering cannabis plant a less favourable solution due to harmful health effects such as cardiovascular damage, lung cancers and the precipitation of psychosis to name but a few which result from the inhalation of either combusted plant matter.
1.9.4. Con: Cannabis can be of benefit to individuals with a [variety](http://time.com/4573129/marijuana-cannabis-mental-health/) of mental health issues, including social anxiety, depression and PTSD.
1.9.5. Con: Cannabis is already easily available everywhere in the EU. A significant proportion of the population already uses cannabis. These users are already exposed to the potential risks. Legislation will reduce the risks by regulating the supply chain and enabling users to be properly educated about risk minimization.
1.9.5.1. Pro: In 2016, an estimated [17.1 million](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/6343/TI_PUBPDF_TD0117699ENN_PDFWEB_20171009153649.pdf) young Europeans \(aged 15–34\), or 13.9 % of this age group, used cannabis.
1.9.6. Pro: Long-term consumption of cannabis can affect negatively and irreversibly both mental and physical health.
1.9.6.1. Pro: One study [showed](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana) that people who started smoking marijuana heavily in their teens and had an ongoing marijuana use disorder lost an average of 8 IQ points between ages 13 and 38.
1.9.6.2. Pro: Long term cannabis use negatively affects the [memory](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201536).
1.10. Pro: Other currently legal substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and prescription opioids have far less positive impact on users health.
1.10.1. Pro: An estimated [88,000 people](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics) in the US and [195,000 people](https://ec.europa.eu/health/archive/ph_determinants/life_style/alcohol/documents/alcohol_factsheet_en.pdf) in the EU die from alcohol-related causes annually.
1.10.2. Con: That other substances are harmful is an argument to make them less accessible, not necessarily an argument to make other drugs legal.
1.10.2.1. Con: Making alcohol and cigarettes illegal would create a black market and stimulate drug trafficking. See [Al Capone](https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/america-1918-1939/prohibition-and-the-gangsters/)
1.11. Pro: Legalizing cannabis will free up space in courtrooms and prisons.
1.11.1. Pro: Incarceration for minor possession of marijuana is possible in [more than half](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/topic-overviews/cannabis-policy/html_en) of European countries.
1.12. Con: Legalization will hike up prices.
1.12.1. Con: This does not appear to have happened thus far in the new legal markets. Indeed would be counter-productive in terms of replacing a black market with a legal market.[Marijuana prices after legal growers enter the market](https://grizzle.com/marijuana-prices-legal-growers-market/)
1.12.2. Pro: Prices will include the Europe's generally high [tax rate](https://www.vatlive.com/vat-rates/european-vat-rates/).
