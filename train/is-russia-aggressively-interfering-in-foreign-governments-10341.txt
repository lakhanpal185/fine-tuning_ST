Discussion Title: Is Russia Aggressively Interfering In Foreign Governments?

1. Russia is aggressively interfering in foreign governments.
1.1. Con: Most news is judgemental and under-investigated, and prone to political motives. Russia is an obvious target to allow certain international forces to move towards their own economic imperialism.
1.2. Pro: Russia's attempted [assassination](https://news.sky.com/story/how-the-spy-poisoning-unfolded-in-salisbury-11288348) of Mr Skripal and Ms Skripal in the UK proves their interference.
1.2.1. Con: Retired US Ambassador to Uzbekistan, [Craig Murray](https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/03/the-novichok-story-is-indeed-another-iraqi-wmd-scam/), says that the accusation of Russia using Novichok in targeted assassinations is a lie. Murray should know: he worked in the former Soviet region where Novichok is alleged to have originated from, and says that all chemical stock piles were found and destroyed by the US while he was ambassador.
1.2.2. Con: Russian military stockpiles of all chemical weapons [were destroyed](https://www.opcw.org/news/article/opcw-marks-completion-of-destruction-of-russian-chemical-weapons-stockpile/) as per international agreements; Russia would not have access to military-grade novichok.
1.2.3. Con: Mr Skripal has paid for his crimes, and his daughter travels freely to Russia regularly. Their relationship with Russia is normal, meaning there is no motive nor benefit to Russia attempting assassination.
1.2.4. Con: UK’s Prime Minister Theresa May and UK’s Foreign Minister Boris Johnson [categorically stated](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/12/russia-highly-likely-to-be-behind-poisoning-of-spy-says-theresa-may) that Russia is responsible for having carried out a chemical attack using a nerve agent in Salisbury. [Boris Johnson](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-russia-nerve-agent-attack-novichok-porton-down-responsible-false-statements-a8290546.html) said that scientists at England’s top chemical laboratory had identified the nerve agent Novichok as having come from Russia. 

However, these scientists have stated they cannot verify where the Novichok came from. Therefore the UK is accusing Russia with a bare faced lie.
1.2.5. Pro: Several countries have expelled foreign diplomats in response to evidence that Russia was culpable for the poisoning.
1.3. Con: Russia is not aggressively interfering; it is the product of a propaganda campaign again Russia. The campaign, and what the ensuing investigations did not want to investigate, are explained here: [www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/FoxNewsVoices/videos/932254773589745/)
1.4. Pro: Russia [is meddling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/01/05/russia-has-been-meddling-in-foreign-elections-for-decades-has-it-made-a-difference/?utm_term=.428b760fd120) in foreign elections.
1.4.1. Con: If a foreign nation is about to elect a leader whose policies will significantly impact your nation, It is not unreasonable for your nation to seek a "vote" in a foreign election. Most of the time, this is just called "lobbying."
1.5. Pro: Russia is directly interfering with the governance of other countries through [assassination](https://www.rferl.org/a/uk-russia-montenegro-coup-election-plot/28318082.html), coup d'etats and intimidation.
1.5.1. Pro: In [2016](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/06/29/russian-hacks-john-mccain-column/436354001/), Russian intelligence operatives plotted to overthrow the democratically elected government of Montenegro and murder its prime minister.
1.6. Pro: Russia is using [cyber warfare](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/610543/america-has-accused-russia-of-cyber-attacks-on-us-infrastructure/) to undermine and attack the institutions of foreign governments.
1.6.1. Pro: Russia has used cyber attacks to target [Montenegrin](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/russia-s-fancy-bear-hacks-its-way-into-montenegro-03-01-2018) institutions as well as stealing important military information.
1.6.2. Pro: Russia has used cyber attacks against neighbouring [Georgia](https://www.cfr.org/report/renewed-confrontation-georgia) to intimidate the country into bending to its will.
1.7. Pro: Russia is using [social media](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/politics/russian-disinformation-aids-fake-news.html) to disseminate fake news.
1.7.1. Con: People who are qualified to vote in national elections should have well-developed critical thinking skills. The existence of fake news is less of a problem than people who cannot distinguish between real and fake news.
1.7.1.1. Con: Regrettably, in a world where we depend on news stations to give us an accurate - albeit biased - report of what occurs worldwide, no amount of critical thinking can see through it. We can only work with what we are given.
1.7.1.2. Pro: There is an onus of responsibility on individuals to not take a single news source as gospel. It is perfectly possible to weigh up the evidence given on different news platforms and come to a more nuanced and personal conclusion.
1.7.2. Pro: Russia used social media to interfere in the UK's [2016 Brexit referendum](http://www.euronews.com/2018/02/12/new-report-concludes-russian-social-media-interfered-in-uk-s-eu-referendum) in order to weaken the European Union - one of Russia's primary adversaries on the world stage.
1.7.3. Con: While social media activity on the part of the Russian government is likely, there is [little evidence](https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/tom-junes/russian-interference-in-virtual-world-is-not-problem) that Russia's social media presence alone could have swung important elections such as the Brexit referendum or the 2016 US presidential election.
1.7.4. Pro: Russia used social media to influence [energy markets](http://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/113574-russia-used-social-media-to-influence-us-energy-markets-since-2015-lawmakers-say).
1.7.5. Pro: Russia used social media to influence the US elections [in 2016](https://www.wired.com/story/did-russia-affect-the-2016-election-its-now-undeniable/).
1.7.6. Con: There is no proof that the Russian government was involved. This is likely the result of private groups.
1.8. Con: Russia, a sovereign nation, has legitimate national interests around the world and should therefore be able to represent their interest in any way they deem appropriate.
1.8.1. Pro: The only source to prove that Russia is interfering in foreign governments is the propaganda from their opponents; as such, any accusations should be considered sceptically.
1.8.2. Con: International law and treaties exist that place limits on the actions of all nations. Whether the nation deems it appropriate or not is irrelevant when the action is in violation of international law. For instance: murder by any nation is illegal, either within or beyond their borders, yet Russia \(and many other states\) 'deem it appropriate' in certain circumstances.
1.9. Con: Russia is acting no differently than other countries.
1.9.1. Pro: The US has regularly [interfered](https://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/complaints-about-foreign-meddling-in-american-elections-are-hypocritical-for-the-us-is-one-of-the-worst-culprits-1.706505) in the elections and governments of foreign states consistently throughout its history: in [Latin America](http://listverse.com/2009/07/11/10-cases-of-american-intervention-in-latin-america/), the [Ukraine](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/americas-ukraine-hypocrisy-21803) and [Russia](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/the-us-has-a-long-history-of-election-meddling/565538/) to name just a few.
1.9.1.1. Con: Unlike Russian [electoral meddling](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/03/12/is-u.s.-hypocritical-to-criticize-russian-election-meddling-pub-75780), U.S. democracy promotion does not seek to exacerbate sociopolitical divisions, systematically spread lies, favour particular candidates, or undercut the technical integrity of elections.
1.9.1.2. Con: Russia is interfering on a scale that is unprecedented in comparison to other countries. The next biggest culprit - the US, has massively [scaled down](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/03/12/is-u.s.-hypocritical-to-criticize-russian-election-meddling-pub-75780) its interference since the end of the Cold War.
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.9.1.1.
1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.9.1.2.
1.9.4. Con: This is irrelevant to the discussion. The action of other countries doesn't change the fact that Russia is or isn't aggressively interfering.
