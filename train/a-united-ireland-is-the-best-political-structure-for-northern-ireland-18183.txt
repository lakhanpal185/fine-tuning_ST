Discussion Title: A United Ireland is the best political structure for Northern Ireland

1. A United Ireland is the best political structure for Northern Ireland
1.1. Pro: A United Ireland solves the Brexit problems with Northern Ireland.
1.1.1. Pro: A United Ireland would end the possibility of a hard border following Brexit.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Northern Irish citizens could maintain their EU citizenship status and all of the rights and benefits that entails.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Northern Irish citizens already have access to EU citizenship, as they are entitled to Irish passports in the current situation.
1.1.1.2. Pro: If Northern Ireland remains within the UK then a trade boarder at least is [unavoidable.](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/trade-border-between-ireland-and-uk-now-inevitable-1.3410435)
1.2. Pro: An all Ireland economy would be stronger.
1.2.1. Con: The public sector accounts for over [30%](https://www.nerinstitute.net/blog/2015/03/12/employment-in-the-public-sector/) of employment in Northern Ireland. This represents a huge additional burden that would be placed on public expenditure in the Republic.
1.2.2. Pro: A united Ireland allows for [increased](http://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/48211) economies of scale when developing infrastructure. This would boost economic growth.
1.2.2.1. Con: There are already shared economies of scale between North and South when developing infrastructure, such as the [SEM](https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/energy/topics/Electricity/commission-for-energy-regulation-\(cer\)/Pages/Single-Electricity-Market-\(SEM\).aspx).
1.2.3. Con: Northern Ireland's economy relies upon UK [subsidies](https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/opinion/northern-ireland-would-plunge-to-the-level-of-a-developing-nation-if-we-lost-uk-subsidies-1-8598687). Removing these and unifying the country would lead to huge shortfalls.
1.2.3.1. Con: This assumes no deals would be made as a substitute for the previous subsidies.
1.3. Con: The Northern Irish population does not want a united Ireland.
1.3.1. Pro: Public opinion polling shows [most in Northern Ireland](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/new-poll-finds-just-21-support-for-a-united-ireland-despite-fears-about-post-brexit-irish-border/) would like to remain in the UK.
1.3.2. Pro: A united Ireland can never be the best structure for Northern Ireland if its population is against it.
1.3.2.1. Pro: The [Good Friday Agreement](https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/alldfawebsitemedia/ourrolesandpolicies/northernireland/good-friday-agreement.pdf) enshrines the right of the people of Northern Ireland to decide their constitutional status.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The risk of political antagonism, obstructionism and even violence from Unionists is massively increased if they can justify their actions as representative of the Northern Irish population.
1.3.3. Con: Already as many as [42%](http://www.thejournal.ie/united-ireland-poll-3-4059433-Jun2018/) of people would like to see a united Ireland. As the number of Nationalists [grows](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/catholic-majority-in-northern-ireland-to-present-dilemma-for-britain-and-republic-1.438788) relative to the number of Unionists, it seems that soon the majority will want a united Ireland.
1.4. Pro: A United Ireland would reconnect and rejuvenate shared cultures.
1.4.1. Pro: The cultural identity of Ireland, particularly international impressions, exists in both Northern and Southern parts; it would be ultimately positive to unite the two.
1.4.2. Con: The vastly different entrenched religious and sociocultural disparities make this unlikely.
1.4.3. Con: Uniting Ireland would make the unionist community feel under attack, even [besieged](http://www.judecollins.com/2017/08/siege-mentality-joe-mcveigh/).
1.4.4. Pro: The Irish state invested [â‚¬130,000](https://www.chg.gov.ie/minister-madigan-approves-over-e130k-in-funding-for-cross-border-cultural-projects-under-cooperation-with-northern-ireland-scheme-2018/) in cross boarder cultural initiatives. a unified political structure is simply not necessary in order to rejuvenate shared culture.
1.5. Con: A United Ireland could result in renewed conflict.
1.5.1. Con: Conflict has generally been settled in Ireland.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Terrorism by the IRA has become so marginal that sex abuses by priests are perceived as [worse](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/world/europe/francis-ireland-sexual-abuse-catholic-church.html).
1.5.2. Pro: Even if it was an overall positive experience, entrenched beliefs are difficult to overcome; it will take a very long time, if ever, for full cessation of conflict.
1.6. Pro: A United Ireland would create a more efficient and effective public service.
1.7. Con: A United Ireland could cripple the ROI economy.
1.7.1. Pro: Northern Ireland's GDP per capita is [38%](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/a-united-ireland-would-be-worse-off-than-the-republic-1.3010177) lower than the Republics. Overall, reunification would lead to an 11% drop in GDP per capita for the Republic.
1.7.2. Con: The unification of East and West Germany has not lead to economic collapse of the nation.
1.7.3. Pro: The fear of the return of conflict that would occur with a united Ireland [would scare off much needed FDI.](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/the-case-for-and-against-a-united-ireland-1.3013466)
1.7.4. Pro: Northern Ireland has an [inflated number](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/united-ireland-would-mean-huge-job-cuts-for-northern-ireland-says-the-academic-hailed-by-sinn-fein-35154942.html) of public sector workers in comparison to the Republic. The Republic would either be forced to shoulder the burden of additional government expenditure, or Northern Ireland would face significant job losses.
1.7.5. Pro: Northern Ireland [spends more tax](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/northern-ireland-public-spending-highest-in-uk-14020-per-head-35747632.html) than it earns, Republic of Ireland cannot afford to maintain this and would need to cut spending.
1.8. Con: A United Ireland could see the end of NHS provision for citizens of the North.
1.8.1. Con: They could install a parallel service that operates independently of the existing NHS.
1.9. Pro: A United Ireland could see the end of 800 years of injustice and conflict.
1.9.1. Con: It is this exact history that makes a United Ireland impossible: the injustices and conflicts are too deep-set to be put aside.
