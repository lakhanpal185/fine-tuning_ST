Discussion Title: Should Drinking Water Be Fluoridated?

1. Drinking water should be fluoridated
1.1. Con: Water fluoridation is no longer necessary, since fluoride is now present in many other sources.
1.1.1. Con: Some of these sources are just secondary results of water fluoridation. 

["Quantifying the diffused benefit from water fluoridation"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0528.2001.290206.x/abstract)
1.1.2. Pro: Fluoride does not really need to be in water, as it exists in toothpaste and mouthwash that we do not swallow.
1.1.2.1. Con: Fluoride in water works in addition to fluoride toothpaste, mouthwash, and toothpaste.  A most recent [study](https://healthjournalism.org/blog/2018/06/study-of-decade-of-data-confirms-effectiveness-of-community-water-fluoridation/) confirms that in current conditions, fluoridation is still relavent.
1.1.3. Con: As recently as 2015 the Department of Health and Human Services [reaffirmed](https://www.ada.org/~/media/EBD/Files/PHS_2015_Fluoride_Guidelines.pdf?la=en) the benefit of fluoridation in reducing cavities. It looked at current "evidence of fluoride intake" \(pg.  1 and pg. 3\)
1.1.4. Pro: [Foods already contain fluoride](http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-000146000000000000000.html?categories=19,10,8), so eating those will allow fluoride to attach onto teeth.
1.1.4.1. Con: A recent review by [HHS](https://www.ada.org/~/media/EBD/Files/PHS_2015_Fluoride_Guidelines.pdf?la=en) looking at diet found that fluoridation continues to work in addition to other available sources.
1.1.4.2. Con: One of the reasons that food had a small amount of fluoride is due to community water fluoridation. Without community water fluoridation, foods would contain less fluoride and those benefits would be reduced.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: The amount of Fluoride in all foods would be reduced.  Then the public can eat more of the reduced fluoride food to get a similar amount of fluoride.  The person will also benefit from eating more vegetables and fruits in their diet.
1.2. Con: Sodium Fluoride was once used as rat poison and insecticide.  \([Rodenticide Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2390848)\)
1.3. Con: 95% of all fluorides ingested are deposited in your bones, brain and other organs.  When the concentrations reach peak levels it can also invade you muscle tissue and ligaments.  This chronic accumulation will cause many and various problems.   \([Source](https://www.fluoride-class-action.com/fluoride-interferes-with-calcium)\)
1.3.1. Con: "Approximately 99% of the fluoride in the human body is found in bones and teeth" and, "Soft tissues do not accumulate fluoride" [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/fluoridation/en/l-3/2.htm)
1.4. Con: Many of the claims and early trials concerning fluoridation were misread, misinterpreted, mishandled and major factors ignored.  \([Source](http://cof-cof.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Sutton-Fluoridation-Errors-And-Omissions-In-Experimental-Trials-Melbourne-University-Press-1959-1960.pdf)\)
1.5. Pro: Lack of dietary fluoride [leads to health problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine_deficiency).
1.5.1. Con: Excess fluoride can cause neurological problems \([Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/08/22/does-fluoride-in-drinking-water-hurt-your-brain.html),  [Science Study](https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/9)\). 
[Med News](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154164.php),   [Web MD](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1068/fluoride)
1.5.2. Con: Excess fluoride can cause thyroid damage \([Scientific Study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20696-4)\).
[Med News](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154164.php),    [Web MD](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1068/fluoride)
1.5.3. Con: The lack of fluoride in a diet does not cause any illness or disease, it only makes your teeth less resistant to decay.  It is the decay that causes health problems.  [Fluoride deficiency](http://preventative and protective properties).
1.6. Con: Sodium Fluoride is highly corrosive.  \([Hazard page](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sodium_fluoride#section=GHS-Classification&fullscreen=true)\)
1.6.1. Con: ["The concern that using fluorosilicate additives to fluoridate drinking water causes water system pipes to corrode is not supported by science."](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/engineering/corrosion.htm)
1.7. Con: The Nazis added fluoride to the concentration camps to make the people more docile and less likely to revolt.  [\(Link\)](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111202061928AAH01qP)
1.7.1. Con: This is an urban myth [www.politifact.com](https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/oct/06/critics-water-fluoridation/truth-about-fluoride-doesnt-include-nazi-myth/)
1.8. Con: Fluoride calcifies the Pineal Gland which can cause reduced melatonin production.
1.9. Con: Sodium Fluoride is used as an insecticide.  \([Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sodium_fluoride)\)
1.10. Con: The CDC should not be trusted.  They are corrupt and vaguely have the public health as its main concern.
1.10.1. Pro: They took 30 years to recognize the use of lead was toxic \(although it has been known for hundreds of years\), They admitted to giving biological agents to foreign countries \(Botulinum toxin, West Nile virus, Yersinia pestis and Dengue fever virus\), they sprayed DDT on more than six and a half million homes....
1.10.2. Pro: "[Grandfathered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clause) in" chemicals wreak of error and corruption, which both the EPA and CDC support.
1.11. Con: Fluoridating water is bad for the environment.
1.11.1. Pro: Water fluoridation is harmful to wild animals [iaomt.org](https://iaomt.org/resources/fluoride-facts/fluoride-pollution-environment/)
1.11.1.1. Pro: "[Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4213386/)" is study that found that fluoride from runoff in a isolated pond caused infertility and weak bones in geese.
1.11.1.2. Con: Wild animals do not drink from public water systems regularly, therefore would not be impacted by any form of community water fluoridation.
1.11.1.3. Con: Oceans have a greater fluoride content by volume than what is provided through community water fluoridation.
1.11.2. Con: Research reported by the Center for Disease Control showed levels of fluoride present in water are [safe](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/pdf/pollick.pdf) for the environment, including plants and animals. \(pg. 6\)
1.11.3. Pro: If water fluoridation leads to CFCs by means of the hydrogen cycle it would contribute to the loss of O3 in the upper atmosphere. Freeing fluoride from its bonded element or compounds would mean it bonds with something else. If hydrocarbons are made into fluorocarbons it would require higher temperatures to metabolise or remove from the environment.
1.11.3.1. Con: Fluoride in water is a fluoride ion \(from rock\) that incorporates readily into tooth enamel.  It is not a gas.  Therefore, this fear is unjustified.
1.12. Pro: Fluoride prevents tooth decay, including cavities.
1.12.1. Con: [Scientists](http://www.newsweek.com/fluoridation-may-not-prevent-cavities-huge-study-shows-348251) have found insufficient evidence to support that fluoride prevents tooth decay.
1.12.2. Pro: Researchers believe fluoride [reduces](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-does-the-fluoride-in/) the solubility of enamel in acid by converting hydroxyapatite into fluorapatite, a less soluble compound.
1.12.3. Pro: According to the [Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/pdf/natures_way.pdf), fluoridated water in community drinking water has played a major role in the declining rates of tooth decay.
1.12.3.1. Con: Advances in dentistry \(ex: Tooth Paste, Tooth Brushes, Dental Drills...\) could have skewed the results. [dental.nyu.edu](https://dental.nyu.edu/aboutus/history-of-nyucd/technology-in-dentistry-through-the-ages.html)
1.12.4. Con: [Silica](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150916112604.htm), one of the most prominent natural chemical compounds on earth, also prevents tooth decay, and has not been shown to be harmful like fluoride.
1.12.4.1. Pro: Silica is more individualized which is a benefit, those who want added cavity protection can get it.  As apposed to a forced medication onto the public.
1.12.4.2. Con: There are not enough long term studies on the affects of silica on dental health to suggest it over fluoride.
1.12.4.3. Con: Community water fluoridation is one of the most proven methods to improve oral health \(70 year safe track record\). Silica, is a new method as per the article, as recent as 2015.
1.12.4.4. Con: Silica has promise as an expensive individually focused preventative treatment that does not improve the public's health, but is being marketed for consumers.
1.12.5. Pro: Cavities impact [quality of life](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/83/9/editorial30905html/en/) and can even result in [death](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/27/AR2007022702116_2.html), therefore, finding solutions to prevent cavities is a public health imperative
1.12.6. Pro: Oral health is part of [overall health](https://www.dentalhealth.ie/dentalhealth/causes/general.html) and should be prioritized for that reason.
1.13. Con: Fluoridated water has negative health effects.
1.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.
1.13.3. Pro: A [study found](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/fluoride-childrens-health-grandjean-choi/) that fluoride negatively impacts cognitive development in children.
1.13.3.1. Con: In a [statement](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2012/07/Media-Statement_Fluoride-9-12-12-Revised2.pdf) by the authors, "These results do not allow us to make any judgment regarding possible levels of risk at levels of exposure typical for water fluoridation in the U.S."
1.13.3.2. Con: Subsequent studies show [no impact](https://ilikemyteeth.org/new-study-no-neurotoxic-effect/) to IQ.
1.13.3.3. Con: A study published in February 2018, was conducted by a team of environmental scientists with the support of the National Toxicology Program \(NTP\) Division of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences \(NIEHS\) and showed [no neurotoxic effects](https://ilikemyteeth.org/new-study-no-neurotoxic-effect/).
1.13.4. Con: Community water fluoridation has been a proven method to improve health for over [70 years](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/basics/70-years.htm). "One of public health's greatest success stories".
1.13.5. Con: Community Water Fluoridation is supported by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/index.html), the [American Dental Association](https://www.ada.org/en/public-programs/advocating-for-the-public/fluoride-and-fluoridation/ada-fluoridation-policy), the [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/American-Academy-of-Pediatrics-Supports-HHS-Fluoride-Recommendations-for-Drinking-Water.aspx) among many many other agencies we rely on for our health.
1.13.5.1. Con: The [CDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention) is corrupt and vaguely have the public health as its main concern.  They took 30 years to recognize the use of lead was toxic \(although it has been known for hundreds of years\), They admitted to giving biological agents to foreign countries \(Botulinum toxin, West Nile virus, Yersinia pestis and Dengue fever virus\), they sprayed DDT on more than six and a half million homes....
The ADA and AAP only follow what the CDC says and even "cut and paste" quote them directly.
1.13.6. Pro: Fluorine is highly reactive and without knowing its cycle, saying no toxic fluorides will occur after the heating of compounds in tap water is impossible.
1.13.6.1. Pro: [Here](https://www.fluoride-class-action.com/fluoride-interferes-with-calcium)is an in depth study showing the adverse effects of acute and chronic fluorides in the body.  Calcium Fluoride is found naturally in water sources and is deemed safe.  Fluorosilicic acid and Sodium Fluoride is synthesized by industry and added to the water supply.  Fluorosilicic acid and Sodium Fluoride are both highly toxic and react/combine with many other chemicals inside the body, especially calcium.
1.14. Pro: Water sources naturally contain fluoride.
1.14.1. Con: Arsenic is also "[Naturally occurring](http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/En-Ge/Fresh-Water-Natural-Contaminants-in.html)" in water sources. It has the health benefit of reducing breast cancer by 50% and other benefits.  Does that mean we should also add more Arsenic to our water supply?
[History study](https://www.ozy.com/acumen/arsenic-the-health-benefits/37180),
1.14.2. Con: The industrial fluorides added to the water supply are \(Fluosilicic acid, and Sodium Fluoride\) which are not found in natural water sources.  These man made fluorides are unstable and bind to the calcium in your body.  Calcium Fluoride is found in natural sources and is more stable and less harmful when ingested.
\([Scientific Studies](https://www.fluoride-class-action.com/fluoride-interferes-with-calcium)\)
1.14.2.1. Con: Sodium fluoride and calcium fluoride cannot exist in water. Both dissolve completely into ions.  The fluoride ions from calcium fluoride are identical to the fluoride ions from sodium fluoride.
1.14.3. Pro: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [recommends fluoride levels of 0.7 ppm](https://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/6427a6b7538955c585257359003f0230/86964af577c37ab285257811005a8417!OpenDocument), while surface water [naturally contains 0.01 to 0.3 ppm](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2012/403835/).
1.14.4. Pro: Rivers and lakes generally exhibit concentrations of
less than 0.5 mg/l = 0.5 ppm [www.who.int](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/fluoride_drinking_water_full.pdf)
1.15. Pro: We maintain water as a [public good](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/ap-consumer-producer-surplus/ap-externalities-topic/a/public-goods-cnx) in that no one can be excluded from its use and it is nonrivalrous such that one person's use does not preclude another person's use. As such, it is an ideal method for distributing the health benefits of fluoridation.
1.15.1. Pro: The impact of broad distribution of community water fluoridation and its cavity reduction effects reduced the size of the dental industry and their private services. [\(page 17\)](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15056.pdf). This is an example of where a 'public good' reduced the need for private services.
1.15.2. Pro: The practice of community water fluoridation improves health equity.
1.15.3. Con: As the water is a "public good", it is even more important to not modify it or change it in ways others do not agree with. If one wanted to be excluded from fluoride treatment, it is impossible since their "public good" has become tainted and unavoidable.
1.16. Pro: Water fluoridation saves money spent on dental treatments.
1.16.1. Con: The amount of money saved \($38\) with a [average dental procedure of](https://www.mykoolsmiles.com/content/average-dental-costs-without-insurance) \($500\) is not worth the health risks \(Higher doses are UNSAFE and can weaken bones and ligaments, and cause muscle weakness and nervous system problems. High doses of fluoride in children before their permanent teeth come through the gums can cause tooth discoloration.[WEBMD](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1068/fluoride)\) associated with adding more fluoride to your life.
1.16.2. Pro: For most cities, [every $1 invested in water fluoridation saves $38 in dental treatment costs](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/statistics/cost.htm).
1.17. Con: Water fluoridation violates the right to consent to medication.
1.17.1. Con: Water that has been fluoridated is similar to fortifying salt with iodine, milk with vitamin D, orange juice with calcium and bread with folic acid.
1.17.1.1. Con: The fortification of foods with iodine, vitamin D, and calcium is different in that it is avoidable. Tap water being fortified means one cannot avoid it unless there is another way to bring running water into the household.
1.17.1.1.1. Con: A reverse osmosis filter can be installed to remove fluoride from tap water.  But families who want adequate fluoride to prevent cavities in their tap water, cannot do it on their own.
1.17.1.1.1.1. Con: These systems are yet another expense for families. If fluoride is inexpensive and abundant, it should be up to families to fluoridate their own waters, instead of installing products to remove some of it out.
1.17.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no system on the market or permitted by regulators to allow for personal water treatment to adjust for adequate fluoride.
1.17.2. Pro: People should have the right to choose what substance they ingest. When drinking water is fluoridated, this right is removed.
1.17.2.1. Con: People are not forced to drink their community's water. Alternatives are available.
1.17.2.1.1. Con: When you put fluoride in the water system it becomes unavoidable.  It gets into the foods we grow/ wash, it gets absorbed through our skin when we bathe/ wash, it is present in almost every soft drink or alcoholic beverage and it also goes into the environment from run off.
1.17.2.1.2. Con: Fluoride can be absorbed through [skin](https://www.des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/pip/factsheets/ard/documents/ard-ehp-14.pdf). There are no practical alternative to this, as water is needed in other ways than ingestion.
1.17.2.1.2.1. Con: This assertion is false. In fact, the [European Union’s Scientific Committee on Environmental Risks](http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/fluoridation/en/about.htm#7) concluded that “the fluoride ion will not readily pass through the skin and this pathway is not likely to contribute to people’s fluoride intake.”
1.17.2.1.3. Pro: Rainwater can be collected and used for drinking.
1.17.2.1.3.1. Con: [Rainwater](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/rainwater-collection.html) often contains contaminants that are typically purified from drinking water.
1.17.3. Con: There is already fluoride in all water supplies. Some have enough to prevent cavities. Fluoride at the amount we are talking about brings the concentration up to a level found naturally in the environment in many places, therefore, it is not a medication. It cannot violate a "right of consent to medication" if it is not one.
1.18. Con: Fluoride is not an essential nutrient.
1.18.1. Pro: Although there are many non-essential nutrients that humans use on a daily basis.  Our bodies have evolved to handle the low amounts of fluoride naturally in water sources, higher levels and the accumulation of fluoride in a being is known to cause many problems \([WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1068/fluoride), [IcelandStudy](http://www.savingiceland.org/tag/fluoride/)\).
1.18.2. Pro: A [review](http://www.newsweek.com/fluoridation-may-not-prevent-cavities-huge-study-shows-348251) show fluoride may not be essential in cavity prevention.
1.18.2.1. Con: That [review](http://www.cochrane.org/CD010856/ORAL_water-fluoridation-prevent-tooth-decay), despite its [failings](https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2016.257), reaffirmed that community water fluoridation reduces cavities in children: "Our review found that water fluoridation is effective at reducing levels of tooth decay among children."
1.18.3. Pro: Fluoride is an industrial byproduct.
1.18.3.1. Pro: Sodium Fluoride and Fluorosilicic acid are synthesized by industry and added to the water supply.  Both of these chemicals are "classed as rodenticides, insecticides, and pediculicides with acute oral lethal doses in experimental animals comparable to arsenic and lead"  \([Study](https://www.fluoride-class-action.com/fluoride-interferes-with-calcium)\)
1.18.3.2. Con: All fluoride products used in the USA are certified by [NSF standard 60](http://www.nsf.org/services/by-industry/water-wastewater/water-treatment-chemicals/nsf-ansi-standard-60) for use in public water supplies.
1.18.3.3. Con: Fluoride is mined and sold as a [by-product](https://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/minerals-mining-and-metallurgy/metallurgy-and-mining-terms-and-concepts-60#1O13byproduct) to mining for phosphorus as ore mined for phosphorus often has fluoride as well, but there is a much higher demand for phosphorus. Using this term distorts the [purpose](https://ilikemyteeth.org/fluoride-from/) of community water fluoridation to protect the public's health.
1.18.4. Con: There are many non-essential nutrients that humans use on a daily basis. This is no reason for fluoride to be removed from drinking water.
1.18.4.1. Con: It is not that the natural calcium fluoride should be removed.  Sodium Fluoride and Fluorosicilic Acid should not be added.
