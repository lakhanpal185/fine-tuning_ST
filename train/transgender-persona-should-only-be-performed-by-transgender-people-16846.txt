Discussion Title: Transgender persona should only be performed by transgender people

1. Should a transgender persona only be performed by transgender people?
1.1. Con: That would be gender based discrimination, which is illegal. The gender of the performer is not in direct correlation with their performance.
1.1.1. Con: In acting it is common for 'casting calls' to have criteria, including ethnicity and gender, that they are looking for to fill a particular role. Queer actors not having preference for queer roles is the exception rather than the norm.
1.1.2. Pro: Transgender actors and actresses could portray cisgender characters just as well.
1.2. Pro: Not giving transgender roles to transgender people is a form of discrimination.
1.2.1. Pro: Giving cisgender men the roles of trans* women and cisgender women the roles of trans* men reinforces the idea that trans* individuals are not 'real' men or women.
1.2.2. Con: It is anti-discrimination legislation that makes it [illegal](https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2009/09/casting_calls_theres_no_legal_exception_for_showbiz.html) for casting decisions to be considered exempt from equality of employment opportunity.
1.2.3. Pro: Itâ€™s like when black skinned roles were performed by white people.
1.2.3.1. Pro: When white people portrayed black people in blackface they perpetuated stereotypes about how black people acted and what they looked like - reversing progress on racial understanding. Cisgender people playing transgender people risk doing the same thing.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: [Evidence](https://cboulton2013.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/the-glee-effect-by-robert-j-dimaio/) suggests that LGBT representation was instrumental in [shifting](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20140924-the-biggest-ally-of-gay-rights) how LGBT people were viewed by society and [paving](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/05/glee-modern-family-hollywood-reporter-gay-tv-poll_n_2077149.html?guccounter=1) the way for better LGBT rights.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Stereotypes more likely come from social biases that are reflected in the written script, not from the interpretation that the actors perform.
1.3. Con: A role should be given to the best actor, regardless their gender. A transgender man was assigned female at birth, hence some see no problem in casting a female actor for the role.
1.3.1. Con: If Hollywood made major casting decisions based on who truly suits a role best, it wouldn't be a problem. But they don't make decisions that way. They make them by considering not just suitability for a role but also by the actor's bankability. Trans actors who lack name recognition would fall short of bankability criteria. For now and the foreseeable future, Hollywood should cast trans actors for trans roles.
1.3.2. Con: A cis woman has not had the same lived experiences of a trans man.
1.3.3. Con: A transgender man is a man. You wouldn't cast a woman to play Buck Angel.
1.4. Pro: Only transgender people could know the deep psychological intricacies of a transgender persona and express them.
1.4.1. Con: A pirate would be the only person familiar with the intricacies of being a pirate and yet Johnny Depp has gone through 5 movies uncontested.
1.4.1.1. Con: A profession or occupation is in no way as important psychologically and socially to someone as their gender identity.
1.4.2. Con: In that case no heterosexual actor should play a homosexual role, like Jared Letho and Mathew McConaughey did on Dallas Buyers Club. Homosexuals also have deep psychological intricacies of a homosexual persona.
1.4.3. Con: Transition is not a universal experience. Every transgender person lives the transition differently and with various deep psychological implications. It's unfair and simplistic to assimilate two people just because they lived similar experiences and assume they would feel the same way about it.
1.4.4. Pro: A trans* person can give a more accurate portrayal of experiencing body dysmorphia, or other elements of a trans* life, because they have lived through those experiences in a way that may not be possible to explain to a cis actor.
1.4.4.1. Con: Over time, the trans* actor may get used to their lived experience, meaning the cis actor could be better placed to objectively study and portray that experience.
1.4.5. Pro: Transgender people would be more aware of how to portray transgender people authentically and sympathetically, particularly as there is limited mainstream knowledge of transgender people.
1.4.5.1. Con: It may be the case that a trans person could play the part better, assuming equal acting skills. However, the argument is not "which could in theory play the role better"... it's whether only trans people should play the role.
1.4.6. Con: An actress/actor's skill is precisely to be able to perform someone she/he is not.
1.4.7. Pro: A transgender actor lends credibility to the role. A great female actor plays a transgender character in Bold and the Beautiful. However, the audience must mentally trick itself into seeing the female as a trans woman.
1.5. Pro: There is no shortage of transgender actors in the film markets where this debate is taking place.
1.5.1. Pro: However, these actors face a [shortage of roles](http://www.playbill.com/article/trans-actress-activist-laverne-cox-talks-oitnb-dream-roles-and-starting-a-casting-revolution-on-stage-and-screen-com-322592) that they are cast in, and trans* roles being given to cis actors further limits the earning potential of trans* actors.
1.5.1.1. Pro: In her early career, Laverne Cox was [repeatedly told](http://www.playbill.com/article/trans-actress-activist-laverne-cox-talks-oitnb-dream-roles-and-starting-a-casting-revolution-on-stage-and-screen-com-322592) she would not be able to make a career as a trans* actor.
1.5.2. Con: There is a shortage of well known trans* actors forcing production teams to choose between having a famous/ 'top tier' lead for their production, having one of a handful of not-quite-so-famous trans* actors play the lead, or take a risk on a less-known trans* actor, who has less experience and may not be received well by the general public.
1.5.2.1. Con: This situation would be in part resolved by offering more roles to trans* people. Actors usually become famous when landing lead roles.
1.5.3. Con: Actors who have played roles in long term series may object to being required to kiss someone whom they consider to be of the opposite sex. It would make it more difficult to write transgender roles into series with this restriction.
1.6. Pro: It is disrespectful to any real-life figures who transitioned to be portrayed by the gender they did not identify with.
1.6.1. Pro: When a trans* character is played by a cis actor \(e.g. [Eddie Redmayne](https://www.indiewire.com/2015/11/eddie-redmayne-talks-backlash-trans-representation-and-the-power-of-the-male-gaze-in-the-danish-girl-50373/) playing Lili\), we still talk about his performance, and his awards. The trans* community has real concerns that it [reinforces a stereotype](https://mic.com/articles/153149/actress-jen-richards-just-nailed-the-problem-with-casting-cisgender-actors-in-trans-roles#.ljvflXcYz) that trans* people are 'performing' a gender, rather than 'being' that gender.
1.6.2. Con: Art is not a work of fact, it is the artist's vision, however accurately or inaccurately they portray characters. By only ever casting trans* artists for trans* roles, it reinforces the marginalizing of trans* identity, by suggesting that trans* people are so different to everyone else that even in art they should be treated differently to other minority groups.
1.6.3. Con: It is the job of an actor to portray a character. By this line of reasoning, any characteristic of an actor that does not reflect the characteristics of the real-life figure must be considered disrespectful.
1.7. Pro: It might give a chance to a new talent to be known.
1.7.1. Con: This might take the chance from a talent who isn't transgender.
1.7.1.1. Con: There are countless roles out there for cis performers. Those selected for trans* roles are often 'big name performers' who do not face anything like the struggle trans* actors have in securing employment in the acting industry.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Hollywood and Broadway have [yet to cast](http://www.playbill.com/article/trans-actress-activist-laverne-cox-talks-oitnb-dream-roles-and-starting-a-casting-revolution-on-stage-and-screen-com-322592) an openly trans* actor into a cis role. Yet, it remains equally common to give cis actors trans* roles. This denies employment opportunities to trans* actors in the casting of both cis and trans* roles, while cis actors have better likelihood of being cast for both cis and trans* roles.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Acknowledging talent exists whether trans* or not is what equality looks like.
1.7.2. Pro: For every Laverne Cox and Jamie Clayton out there, there are countless other trans actors/actresses waiting to get their big break.
1.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.7.2.2. Con: The fact that Laverne Cox and others managed to make big careers for themselves despite the disadvantages they faced suggests that talent is what determines their career path and not whether certain roles are reserved for the trans* community.
1.8. Con: If so cis-gender heterosexual characters should not be accessible to LGBTQIA+ actors.
1.9. Pro: Being portrayed in movies and tv series can be a huge boost in visibility for the trans* community. This visibility is necessary in order to normalise them, and break down barriers to their acceptance within mainstream society.
1.9.1. Con: Visibility is only useful to normalise and break down barriers if the visibility of trans* characters and actors shows them as normal, everyday characters. However, trans* roles continue to be overwhelmingly '[other](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-is-why-we-need-trans-actors-playing-everyday-roles_us_5963e3b8e4b0911162fc2e44)' rather than 'mainstream' roles: trans* characters are criminals, in prison, or sex work, or their transition is the focal point, rather than their humour, talent, occupation, beauty, personality, achievements etc.
1.9.2. Pro: It is not necessary for trans* characters to be played for trans* actors in order to have this effect. The trans* community right now needs the normalisation and acceptance they can get from trans* characters played by cis actors that reach mainstream audiences.
1.9.2.1. Con: The community does not have to choose between representation and visibility. The success of actors like Laverne Cox in 'Orange Is The New Black' show that it is possible to get both visibility and representation.
1.9.2.2. Con: For a young trans* kid, a less-mainstream production that has a trans* actor playing a trans* character could create a role model for them. Given [40%](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brynn-tannehill/the-truth-about-transgend_b_8564834.html) of trans* people today have attempted suicide, the impact of positive role models far outweighs potential benefits of visibility for future generations.
1.9.3. Con: Movies and TV exist to entertain audiences and to make money for the companies. This statement assumes the premise that they exist to further social agendas.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.
1.10. Con: Limiting who is allowed to play a role on a gender basis rationale limits artistic liberty \(Cate Blanchett could not have played Bob Dylan\).
1.10.1. Pro: A producer may have a particular vision for a movie, and the best fit for the personality/ voice/ appearance of the character may not be a trans* actor. Limiting their available pool may compromise the artistic vision of the work.
1.11. Con: There can be grey lines between who does and doesn't identify as transgender. If our understanding of our own gender is fluid, then it doesn't make sense to impose gender-based limits.
1.12. Con: This restricts transgender people to being typecast, and restricted to transgender roles, keeping them out of work, or creating token trans characters, which ultimately harms trans people.
1.13. Con: It is counterproductive for transgender people's acceptance in society.
1.13.1. Pro: Movie projects often need a popular actress/actor to draw investors.
1.13.1.1. Pro: If employing trans actors makes a movie or series more difficult to make and less popular, it will not contribute to give transgender people more visibility.
1.13.2. Pro: Denying rights to perform to non transgender people gives a closed minded image of transgender people.
1.13.2.1. Con: Not giving a role to someone who does not fit that role is not denying a right.
1.13.2.1.1. Pro: Men are not generally given women roles and vice-versa, that does not deny any rights.
1.13.2.2. Pro: Given society's misconceptions of trans* people and '[PC culture](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/30/political-correctness-how-the-right-invented-phantom-enemy-donald-trump) [gone mad](http://rsbnetwork.com/2016/12/pc-culture-gone-mad-whatever-happened-to-laughing-at-ourselves-sometimes/)', reserving trans* roles for trans* performers could harm how trans* people are perceived by society.
1.13.3. Pro: Denying the freedom to perform to non transgender people gives a closed minded image of transgender people.
1.13.4. Con: Transgender individuals would be seen as stars when they perform the main roles.
1.13.5. Pro: -> See 1.9.
1.13.6. Pro: A movie performed by a non transgender but popular actress/actor would a have a far broader audience.
