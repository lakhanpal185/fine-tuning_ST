Discussion Title: Should Schoolchildren Wear Uniforms?

1. Kids in schools should wear uniforms.
1.1. Pro: Uniforms are more aesthetically pleasing.
1.1.1. Con: Many school uniforms are unfashionable, particularly in [China](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/932652.shtml), where they have a reputation of being ugly and poorly made.

1.1.2.1. Con: This assumes all students wear the uniform in the same way; this is often not enforced.
1.1.3. Con: This is often untrue; most schoolchildren would not argue that uniforms are in any way aesthetically pleasing.
1.2. Pro: School uniforms make the decision of what to wear easier compared to the thousands of options created by leaving options.
1.2.1. Pro: The competitive element of choosing one's own clothing can lead to bullying and division in schools.
1.2.2. Con: Choosing clothing is hardly a world-ending decision insofar as difficulty.

1.6.1. Con: Not really. If schools still foster creativity in other ways there will be no issues with creativity.

1.10.1.2.2. Con: The [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/feb/29/schools.uk4) ranks worst for school bullying in europe despite widespread school uniforms.
1.10.2. Con: They also can cause antipathy through small things like skirt length or how 'fashionable' one can look in a uniform; 'belonging' in school is more complicated than just wearing uniforms.
