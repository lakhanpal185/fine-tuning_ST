Discussion Title: Should US K-12 schools adopt a 12 month schedule?

1. US K-12 schools should adopt a 12 month schedule.
1.1. Con: A full k-12 school schedule will be very stressful for students.
1.2. Pro: A full-year K-12 educational schedule would create a stronger work ethic in children.
1.3. Pro: A full-year K-12 schedule would raise US standard of education.
1.3.1. Con: [Finland](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/11-best-school-systems-in-the-world-a7425391.html) has the best school system in the world, and they do not have a 12-month schedule. This suggests there are better ways to raise standards of education.
1.3.2. Pro: The loss in skills over the summer duration would be reduced or eliminated due to continuous learning
1.4. Pro: A full-year K-12 schedule would reduce stress for parents.
1.4.1. Pro: Full year schedules would allow all parents to work full time since they wouldn't have to take off work to take care of the children.
1.4.2. Pro: Long summer vacations give children more chances to get in trouble.
1.4.3. Pro: Year-round school would reduce need for daycare, hence parents could save money.
1.5. Pro: A full-year K-12 schedule would better prepare students for college.
1.6. Con: A full-year K-12 school schedule would increase school taxes.
1.6.1. Pro: Facilities would need to be upgraded for air conditioning
1.6.1.1. Con: Air Conditioning is already needed in NY in order for the terms to go until [June 30th](https://www.holiday-weather.com/new_york_city/averages/june/).
1.6.2. Pro: Teachers would need to be paid more.
1.6.3. Con: Assuming the same amount of teaching days it should be a net wash for costs, just a different timeline.
1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.7. Con: A full-year K-12 school schedule would reduce parent-child interaction.
1.8. Con: A full-year K-12 school schedule would reduce the child's recreational opportunities.
1.8.1. Con: Recreational activities could be incorporated into the national curriculum.
1.8.2. Con: It depends on the structure, 2 weeks off every quarter instead of 8 weeks off in the summer, if the same teaching amount is spread over 12 months then there is no loss of interaction, just more opportunities to do different things \(with refreshed parents\). I believe this is the Japanese structure.
1.8.3. Con: For those without means, the long summer is spent in front of a screen, away from the structured gym class in school
