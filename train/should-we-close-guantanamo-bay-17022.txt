Discussion Title: Should we close Guantanamo Bay?

1. Guantanamo Bay should be closed.
1.1. Pro: Guantanamo Bay has done little to make the United States safer.
1.1.1. Pro: The majority of terrorist attacks on US soil have been committed by [far-right nationalists](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/terrorism-right-wing-america-muslims-islam-white-supremacists-study-a7805831.html), who are not combatted by Guantanamo Bay's existence.
1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that the existence of Guantanamo Bay does not prevent all types of terrorism is not a reason to close it; even if it only prevents some attacks, it makes the United States a safer place.
1.1.1.2. Con: Guantanamo exists due to the legal complexities of trying enemy combatants largely captured outside the United States. Far-right nationalists can be adequately dealt with using domestic law enforcement mechanisms.
1.1.2. Pro: No Guantanamo Bay [detainees](https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/03/politics/trump-guantanamo-bay/index.html) have ever been captured on US soil; the material danger these detainees pose to US citizens is there for quite small.
1.1.2.1. Con: While they have been captured outside the US, many detainees have planned operations within the US which have endangered American citizens.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Khalid Sheikh Mohammed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/11/will-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-come-to-trial-9-11-attacks), one of Guantanamo's most notable detainees, likely orchestrated the 9/11 attacks.
1.1.2.2. Con: Guantanamo Bay detainees such as Abdel Rahim al-Nashiri have been accused of carrying out [attacks](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/18/world/meast/uss-cole-bombing-fast-facts/index.html) on US military personnel outside of the US.
1.1.3. Pro: Only a [minority](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13184845) of all detainees at Guantanamo have been deemed to be highly dangerous, and many have been innocent.
1.1.3.1. Con: Many detainees who were released [committed subsequent violent acts](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/jan/25/cory-gardner/how-many-released-guantanamo-bay-prisoners-commit-/), meaning it is likely that a number of people were kept safe for the period of time these detainees were in custody.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Governments could eliminate crime by simply imprisoning the entire population, but the rights of the imprisoned are considered more important.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: This is not analogous to the government imprisoning the entire population. There are individuals at Guantanamo Bay who can be reliably determined to be highly likely to commit future violent acts against innocents. The rights of those innocents must be protected.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The purpose of imprisoning criminals and suspected criminals is to prevent them from infringing on the rights of the innocent.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: It is likely that the inhumane conditions to which prisoners of Guantanamo Bay were subjected contributed to some of the violent attacks by former prisoners.
1.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Being held captive and tortured by US officials reinforces an anti-US sentiment already held by many terror suspects.
1.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Ex-prisoners would likely want to seek revenge for their time in captivity.
1.1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: If this is true, it suggests that it may be too dangerous to close Guantanamo Bay and risk the possibility that former detainees would seek revenge.
1.1.3.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Keeping Guantanamo Bay open makes the problem cyclical; as more detainees are added to the prison, the chance that some will seek revenge upon their release increases.
1.1.3.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: This is an argument for limiting the detainee population at Guantanamo to those who are highly likely to be guilty and therefore remain incarcerated, rather than for its closure.
1.1.3.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Many detainees have been released from Guantanamo Bay already \(and more are likely to be in the future\) despite its continued existence. Given this, the continued existence of Guantanamo Bay does not necessarily guarantee the safety of the United States.
1.1.3.2. Con: While the selection of detainees in the past may have been flawed, this is an argument for reforming those procedures, not for releasing the most dangerous of detainees.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: The closure of Guantanamo Bay does not mean the release of the most dangerous prisoners, there are alternatives to this particular facility.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The United States has multiple federal supermax security prisons, from which [no inmate has ever escaped](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/21/barack-obama/obama-correct-no-inmate-has-ever-escaped-supermax-/). These prisons are up to the task of detaining terror suspects.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: These detainees cannot be be imprisoned on US soil without being [convicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_Clause) of a crime.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: This would have the added benefit of ensuring that these detainees are given a fair trial before being sent to these prisons \(or, where appropriate, released\).
1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Guantanamo Bay prisoners can be released to a variety of [host nations](http://time.com/3624445/guantanamo-detainees-uruguay/) under specifically negotiated agreements, as has been the practice so far.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Some prisoners released so far have [returned to terrorism](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-isis-attacks-arrests-terror-plots-islamic-state-guantanamo-inmate-bordeaux-paris-raids-a7764336.html), proving that the release of detainees is unsafe.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Director of National Intelligence [released a report](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/GTMO_Reengagement_Summary_CDA_-Response.pdf) that stated that 30.1% of individuals who had been released from Guantanamo Bay have since resumed terrorist activities.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: [Abdallah Saleh Ali Al-Ajmi](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-wisely-keeping-really-bad-dudes-in-guantanamo-bay) was released from Guantanamo Bay by the Bush administration. After release, he killed 13 soldiers and wounded 42 others in a suicide bombing attack in Iraq.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: The Obama administration released [Ibrahim al Qosi](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-wisely-keeping-really-bad-dudes-in-guantanamo-bay) from Guantanamo bay in 2012. After release, he became a senior leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1.4. Pro: ISIS claimed that Abu-Zakariya al-Britani a British citizen formerly held at Guantanamo Bay, [detonated a car bomb](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/22/europe/blair-guantanamo-bay-iraq-bombing/) at an Iraqi army base southwest of Mosul, killing many.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1.4.1. Con: This man was sent to Guantanamo Bay by extrajudicial methods. It came at the [expense of the rule of law](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/23/opinions/why-closing-guantanamo-is-essential-opinion/index.html) and the traditional criminal justice system. He was never proven to be a terrorist before he went to Guantanamo. It is therefore possible he was radicalized in the prison system.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: This might be a reason not to detain further suspects in Guantanamo Bay, but cases like this prove that the release of the facility's current population is unsafe, regardless of the source of their radicalism.
1.1.4. Pro: The inhumane conditions at Guantanamo Bay are used as a recruitment device and propaganda tool by terrorist organisations.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The Taliban and Al Qaeda have featured Guantanamo Bay [prominently](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/04/how-guantanamo-bays-existence-helps-al-qaeda-recruit-more-terrorists/274956/) in their recruitment literature.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Figures such as Colin Powell, John Brennan and David Petraeus have all [echoed](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/Quotes-National-Security-Leaders-Support-Closing-Guantanamo.pdf) the view that Guantanamo represents a threat to US national security by assisting in the production of anti-American propaganda.
1.1.5. Pro: Because of the torture inflicted on inmates in Guantanamo Bay, a lot of the victims have given [false testimony](https://www.newsweek.com/2016/05/20/science-shows-torture-doesnt-work-456854.html), unhelpful to America's security interests.
1.1.5.1. Pro: People who are tortured are in such severe pain that they will provide false information simply to make the torturing stop.
1.1.5.2. Pro: False testimony directs police to false locations and leads. It wastes police time and resources.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Apart from resources, false testimony that implicates an innocent individual or group could cause a gross miscarriage of justice.
1.1.5.2.2. Pro: False testimony may prevent the police from tracking down authentic leads - making the country they are protecting even more unsafe than before.
1.2. Con: Guantanamo Bay is needed to keep innocent people safe from terror suspects.
1.2.1. Pro: Only [41 individuals](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/gtmo-by-the-numbers.pdf) are still held in Guantanamo Bay. They are still detained because it would be[too dangerous](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-wisely-keeping-really-bad-dudes-in-guantanamo-bay) to release them.
1.2.2. Con: By putting “suspects “ in jail without trial you risk radicalising their families against potential injustice . Without a robust justice system , your society is broken .
1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.1.
1.2.4. Pro: It would be unsafe to detain international terrorist suspects on US soil.
1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.3. Pro: Guantanamo Bay's continued use is unethical.
1.3.1. Pro: Many prisoners are held [without trial](https://www.hrw.org/guantanamo-trials).
1.3.1.1. Pro: Indefinite detention in the manner used at Guantanamo is a violation of [international law](https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/01/24/us-prolonged-indefinite-detention-violates-international-law).
1.3.1.2. Pro: A right to a due process \(i.e. a fair trial\) is a constitutional right which is fundamental to the American justice system.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The fourth and fifteenth amendments of the United States' Constitution each contain a [due process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_Clause) clause which prevents the United States' government from being able to imprison people outside of the rule of law.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Many detainees of Guantanamo Bay are not American citizens.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: At least [99 detainees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_detainees_at_Guantanamo_Bay) of Guantanamo Bay have been American citizens.
1.3.1.2.2.2. Con: The due process clause applies to both citizens and non-citizens. It stipulates that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property outside of the rule of law", not merely "no citizen".
1.3.1.2.3. Con: Guantanamo Bay is located in Cuba, and as such its detainees are not unconstitutionally held on US soil.
1.3.1.2.3.1. Con: While it might not be technically unconstitutional, it is in essence unconstitutional.
1.3.1.2.3.2. Con: Due process applies to Puerto Rico, which is not a US state but rather a territory, like Guantanamo Bay.
1.3.1.2.3.3. Con: The constitution is a set of ideals to hold a nation to; to only apply these rules based on technicalities is ethically inconsistent.
1.3.1.2.3.4. Con: The US Supreme Court has [found](https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/06/12/us-landmark-supreme-court-ruling-detainees) that Guantanamo detainees have the right to petition federal courts over their detention, indicating that Guantanamo is not exempt from US law.
1.3.1.2.3.4.1. Con: If detainees have the right to petition federal courts about their detention then their detention in Guantanamo is comparable to being remanded without bail pending trial, as often happens in the US and is not considered to be a violation of their right to due process.
1.3.1.2.3.4.1.1. Con: Many Guantanamo detainees are held indefinitely without prospect of a trial, including a substantial number who are in fact [innocent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13184845).
1.3.2. Con: The most important responsibility of the United States government is to ensure its citizens’ safety. Thus, Guantanamo Bay's continued use is not unethical.
1.3.2.1. Con: A responsibility doesn't necessarily make the associated action moral.
1.3.3. Pro: Many individuals who have been released from Guantanamo Bay [continue to suffer](https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/20/after-13-years-in-guantanamo-tortured-for-a-crime-i-didnt-commit-i-will-never-be-free-from-suffering-7727173/) from anxiety and post traumatic stress syndrome. This suggests that the methods used within Guantanamo Bay are deeply unethical.
1.3.4. Pro: The UN has [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guantanamo-torture/u-n-expert-says-torture-persists-at-guantanamo-bay-u-s-denies-idUSKBN1E71QO) that the practice of torture is widespread at Guantanamo.
1.3.4.1. Con: Even if the use of torture is widespread at Guantanamo, this is not necessarily problematic. Information that helps to save American lives can be obtained via the use of torture.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's 2014 report into the use of torture and 'enhanced interrogation' by the CIA found that it was [not an effective means](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/29/us/cia-torture-report-fast-facts/index.html) of extracting information or cooperation from suspects.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.3.4.2. Con: The US [banned](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/jun/16/senate-passes-torture-ban-republicans) torture in Guantanamo Bay.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: There are eye-witness and [first hand accounts](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/10/guantanamo-detainee-abu-zubaydah-cia-torture-hearing) of the CIA perpetrating torture on inmates.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Eye witness and first-hand accounts are not irrefutable evidence, given that they can be fabricated.
1.3.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Similarly, accounts from the US claiming that torture is not taking place are also difficult to prove and can be fabricated.
1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US has an incentive to claim it doesn't torture prisoners as it has received criticism from[international bodies](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15406&LangID=E) for its use of torture.
1.3.4.2.1.2. Pro: [Over 200](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/detention/guantanamo-numbers) FBI agents reported the use of torture in Guantanamo Bay.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: The 2017 [UN report](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guantanamo-torture/u-n-expert-says-torture-persists-at-guantanamo-bay-u-s-denies-idUSKBN1E71QO) found that torture was ongoing in Guantanamo Bay long after the passage of this ban.
1.3.4.3. Con: The US has [denied](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guantanamo-torture/u-n-expert-says-torture-persists-at-guantanamo-bay-u-s-denies-idUSKBN1E71QO) the allegations that they still use torture in Guantanamo Bay.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: An [independent U.N. human rights investigato](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guantanamo-torture/u-n-expert-says-torture-persists-at-guantanamo-bay-u-s-denies-idUSKBN1E71QO)r claimed that inmates were still being tortured at Guantanamo Bay.
1.3.4.4. Con: The solution to the problem of torture in Guantanamo Bay does not necessitate the closure of the facility; a thorough crackdown on torture would be enough.
1.3.4.4.1. Con: 'Enhanced interrogation' and 'torture' have both been banned in Guantanamo, to no meaningful effect.
1.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.2.
1.3.5. Con: Violence against innocent civilians is worse than violence against enemy combatants, so if the use of Guantanamo prevents terror attacks it is on-balance a moral good.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Combatants consent into the possibility of harm when choosing to take part in the conflict. Civilians never opt in to the conflict.
1.3.6. Con: The US military detention facility \(not a “prison” or CF\) at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is legal, moral and ethical. According to Geneva Conventions and Law of War even lawful combatant POW’s may be held without charge or trial “until the end of hostilities.” 731 unlawful combatant detainees have been released from Gitmo and not one has been executed or harmed. 30% Are known or suspected recidivists. Gitmo is a small piece to a big puzzle of how we win the Global War on Terror.[amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GTUTVW/ref=pe_180020_133701680_em_1p_0_ti)
1.3.7. Pro: Military prisons were designed to prevent deaths in war and to speed up the conclusion of conflict. In the absence of direct violence, it is unethical to continue the use of Guantanamo Bay.
1.3.7.1. Con: The US is engaged in an [ongoing and wide-ranging](https://www.thenation.com/article/american-special-forces-are-deployed-to-70-percent-of-the-worlds-countries/) military conflict against terrorist organisations across the world. This form of warfare may be untraditional, but it justifies the use of military prisons.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: In the context of the War on Terror, Guantanamo Bay is necessary both as a way to detain dangerous individual suspects and as a site to interrogate them for valuable information which could save lives.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.3.7.2. Pro: The use of [military commissions](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/29/another-blow-justice-guantanamo-bay-military-commissions) instead of conventional trials at Guantanamo is inefficient and unaccountable, leaving justice in the hands of the military rather than the general judiciary.
1.3.8. Pro: The existence of Guantanamo Bay undermines the principle of due process - which is a pillar of the American nation.
1.3.8.1. Con: Closing Guantanamo Bay is politically unpopular.
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: A [majority](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/04/politics/guantanamo-bay-poll-north-korea/index.html) of the American public believes that the facility should not be closed.
1.3.8.1.1.1. Pro: Politicians have an obligation to represent their constituents. If the majority of Americans oppose Guantanamo Bay being closed, politicians should ensure that it remains open.
1.3.8.1.2. Pro: Members of Congress from both the [Democratic](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/close-guantanamo-funding-senate-obama) and [Republican](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/272294-republicans-move-to-oppose-closing-gitmo) parties have opposed the closure of the facility.
1.3.8.1.3. Con: Whether an action is popular does not affect the morality of that action.
1.3.8.1.3.1. Con: Morality is what people decide it to be, since moral properties do not appear to exist outside of human consciousness. This is particularly true in a democracy where the will of the people has, by definition, legitimacy.
1.3.8.1.3.2. Con: It is legitimate for citizens of the US to choose how they prioritise their own collective sense of safety \(real or merely perceived\) over an immorality which, when looked at in relation to the larger population of the US, is minuscule in scale.
1.3.8.1.3.2.1. Pro: There have been approximately [780 detainees](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/guantanamo/detainees) held for varying periods of time since Guantanamo Bay opened in 2002. 780 people is approximately 0.000002% of the population of the US, which is currently estimated to be at approximately 326 million people.
1.4. Pro: Keeping Guantanamo Bay open is expensive.
1.4.1. Pro: There are also [secondary costs](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/cost-guantanamo) to maintaining Guantanamo as well, such as review boards or Department of Justice and CIA salaries involved in detention.
1.4.2. Pro: The actual cost of Camp 7, for high-value detainees, [is actually classified,](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/cost-guantanamo)meaning we don't even know how expensive operations are.
1.4.3. Pro: The [annual cost](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/01/guantanamo-bush-era-officials-warn-keeping-prison-open-may-be-6bn-error) of imprisoning a detainee in a federal supermax prison is $78,000 per year, vastly less than at Guantanamo.
1.4.3.1. Pro: This cost would be even lower if illegal detainees were handed over to their countries of origin for imprisonment.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: The United States cannot outsource imprisonment to foreign countries for security reasons.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: This principle ought not apply if the prisoners are not of American origin, or were imprisoned without probable cause and due process.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: Past Guantanamo detainees handed into the custody of other states have been released and returned to terrorist activity, as in the case of [Ibrahim al-Qosi](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/31/ibrahim-al-qosi-released-from-guantanamo-emerges-a/) in Sudan.
1.4.3.1.1.2.1. Con: While there may be limited examples of malpractice after release, America's foreign allies play a [central role](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/05/17/how-foreign-intelligence-services-help-keep-america-safe/) in the War on Terror and can, in general, be trusted with custody of suspects.
1.4.3.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.2.1.
1.4.4. Con: The financial cost of protecting American national security from devastating attacks should not matter.
1.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.4.4.2. Con: It matters when the [annual savings](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/cost-guantanamo) that could be made by moving prisoners to US prisons would be more than enough to solve issues like the [Flint water crisis](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/22/flints-crisis-can-be-fixed-with-55m-in-new-pipes-lansing-mayor.html).
1.4.4.2.1. Con: The amount of money required to run Guantanamo is minuscule in the larger scale of the federal budget.  If money is not being put towards other such projects, it is likely for political reasons rather than due to a lack of resources. As such, the financial benefit of the money from Guantanamo going to worthwhile causes cannot be guaranteed.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: In 2013, it cost [$454 million](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/313239-pentagon-guantanamo-2013-costs-more-than-450-million-) to run Guantanamo for the year, which only amounted to approximately 0.00013% of the federal expenditure of [$3.5 trillion](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/45278) dollars that year.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1. Con: The average wage in the U.S. is [$48, 642.](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html) Even if this is a small proportion of the total federal budget, it is still more than the average American would make working for 9000 years.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Given that Guantanamo Bay is in place for the safety of all citizens, it does not make sense to compare it to the potential earnings of a single citizen.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2. Con: A lot of federal expenditure goes to helping people and countries outside of the United States - in the form of financial and military aid. It is unfair to suggest that American citizens see all the benefits of federal spending.
1.4.5. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.1.
1.4.6. Pro: It cost approximately [$11 million](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/detention/wasted-opportunities-cost-detention-operations-guantanamo-bay) per detainee to keep Guantanamo Bay open in 2013.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Transferring prisoners from Guantanamo Bay to other facilities could reduce costs and thereby allow the government to spend more in other areas.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: There is little evidence to suggest that government spending in other areas would increase greatly if Guantanamo Bay was closed.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Con: Government spending is zero sum. One dollar spent in funding Guantanamo Bay is a dollar that could have been spent on some other public good.
1.4.6.1.1.1.1. Con: It is not true that money not spent on Guantanamo would necessarily be used in a socially valuable way. Saved government expenditure is often spent on [tax cuts](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/business/dealbook/tax-bill-wealthy.html) which benefit only a tiny, ultra-wealthy minority.
1.5. Con: There is no suitable solution for dealing with many current prisoners if Guantanamo Bay were to close.
1.5.1. Con: Many nations are willing to [release American hostages](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/04/us/gitmo-detainees-history/index.html) in exchange for Guantanamo bay inmates from their nation being returned to them.
1.5.1.1. Con: Making deals with other nations for the release of American hostages in exchange for Guantanamo detainees will only increase the likelihood of those states taking hostages in future, as it will signal that such actions will secure concessions from the US.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: The US frequently makes [limited diplomatic concessions](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/09/politics/us-political-prisoners-iran-north-korea/index.html) in exchange for the release of American prisoners abroad. The release of less dangerous Guantanamo detainees under such an arrangement would be a fair trade.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: The United States under Bush and Obama already made deals for the release of prisoners; if this argument is true, the train is already out of the station.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Obama [traded 5 Taliban commanders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/06/02/bowe-bergdahl-was-traded-for-5-taliban-commanders-heres-who-they-are/?utm_term=.4f057eedcc03) for the release of Bowe Bergdahl in 2014.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.
1.6. Pro: Closing Guantanamo Bay will improve American diplomatic relations.
1.6.1. Con: Given the amount of soft power America holds in international diplomacy and the extent to which foreign governments are dependent on American goodwill, America can afford to keep Guantanamo Bay open if it creates a benefit to itself, without having to worry about the diplomatic implications of the same.
1.6.1.1. Con: American diplomatic standing abroad is a far from unlimited resource, [especially](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/03/how-trump-has-weakened-the-worlds-view-of-the-us.html) under the Trump presidency. America cannot afford to alienate its allies further.
1.6.1.2. Pro: With the growing geopolitical power of states like Russia and China that are far worse on human rights issues, American allies are unlikely to translate their distaste for Guantanamo Bay into actually cooperating less with the United States.
1.6.2. Con: If the alternatives to hosting detainees at Guantanamo, such as the use of [CIA "black sites"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/01/25/what-are-black-sites-6-key-things-to-know-about-the-cias-secret-prisons-overseas/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ac476001f7d9) are just as controversial, then it's unlikely that closing Guantanamo would be good for diplomatic relations.
1.6.3. Pro: Guantanamo Bay [is a major sticking point](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/21/raul-castro-demands-return-guantanamo-bay-obama-visit) in Cuba-U.S. relations.
1.6.3.1. Con: It does not matter much to the US whether they have a good relationship with Cuba or not.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Cuba is not in a position to hold sway with the US, as their [economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-economy-un/u-s-trade-embargo-has-cost-cuba-130-billion-u-n-says-idUSKBN1IA00T) depends upon the US continuing to relax the heavy trade restrictions previously placed upon Cuba.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: Given Cuba's geographical proximity to the US, it would be wise for the US to have friendly relations with the country.
1.6.3.1.2.1. Con: Proximity means little in terms of making good international relations necessary. The US remains a global superpower, regardless of how their close but small neighbours view them.
1.6.3.2. Con: -> See 1.6.3.1.1.
1.6.4. Pro: Guantanamo Bay [weakens American soft power](http://guantanamo bay diplomacy) when advocating against human rights abuses abroad.
1.6.4.1. Pro: When the Ethiopian government was questioned about its use of[torture](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/26/torture-and-ethiopias-culture-impunity) against ‘militants' Ethiopia responded by accusing the West of hypocrisy.
1.6.4.2. Con: It is disingenuous to claim that regimes which commit human rights abuses will stop doing so if the United States closes Guantanamo Bay.
1.6.4.3. Pro: The maintenance of international legal norms against torture and indefinite detention, one of the key means of enforcing human rights around the world, depends upon compliance by a large number of countries.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: The development of customary international legal norms against human rights abuses requires [many states](http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1393) to participate. The US is undermining this process at Guantanamo.
1.6.4.3.2. Pro: By refusing to comply with its obligations under the [Convention Against Torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_against_Torture) at Guantanamo, the US makes it easier for other countries to do the same.
1.6.4.3.2.1. Pro: A global superpower ignoring the remit of an international convention sets a precedent for other nations to follow suit.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Russian officials have [condemned](https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2018/02/28/russia-expresses-concern-u-s-decision-keep-guantanamo-prison-open/) the use of Guantanamo Bay, which makes US critiques of Russia's human rights record less impactful.
1.6.4.4.1. Con: As the US and Russia are, broadly speaking, diametrically opposed in terms of their current geopolitical interests, it is unlikely that either will pay heed to the other's condemnation; since Russia were unlikely to ever respond positively to the US condemning them, there is no real loss in soft power in this instance.
1.6.4.4.1.1. Con: Russia and the US have shared geopolitical interests on the specific issue of terrorism, and both have [noted](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/putin-and-trump-agree-to-keep-fighting-isis-in-syria-1.3288620) the importance of working together to defeat it. The War on Terror presents an opportunity for US-Russia cooperation.
1.6.5. Pro: American allies [have opposed](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/09/guantanamo-bay-international-criminal-court-fate-beatles-jihadis/) Trump's plan not to close the facility.
1.6.6. Pro: The existence of Guantanamo Bay limits cooperation by American allies in the War on Terror.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Britain paid [millions of pounds in compensation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/22/what-became-of-the-guantanamo-britons-jamal-al-harith) to British nationals that had been imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay.
1.6.6.2. Pro: The [Organization for Security and Cooperation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/international-body-calls-on-u-s-to-close-guantanamo-bay-1447177486) - a body that comprises European states, including all members of NATO, called on the United States to close Guantanamo Bay on the grounds of Human Rights abuses and international cooperation.
1.6.6.3. Pro: Many American allies currently [refuse](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/us/politics/trump-guantanamo-executive-order.html) to hand over captured terror suspects to the United States without a guarantee that they will not be sent to Guantanamo.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.3.8.1.
1.8. Con: The alternatives to Guantanamo Bay are both less safe for the United States and less humane for terror suspects.
1.8.1. Pro: Extraordinary Rendition, where a suspected terrorist is forcefully moved to a state that will torture them, [has been used by the CIA before](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/02/14/outsourcing-torture) and might become more prominent if Guantanamo Bay detention is not an option.
1.8.1.1. Con: If torture is being used in Guantanamo Bay, as it seems likely to be, then it is unclear why Extraordinary Rendition is worse, particularly when there is no guarantee that such a policy would be implemented if Guantanamo Bay were to be closed.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: The United States [currently uses Extraordinary Rendition.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13642987.2017.1397634) If Guantanamo closes, the U.S. will continue to want information from suspected terrorists and will simply obtain it through the other available channels, extraordinary rendition chief among them.
1.8.2. Pro: Political pressure over Guantanamo led the Obama administration to [preference](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/world/asia/origins-of-cias-not-so-secret-drone-war-in-pakistan.html) killing terror suspects with drone strikes rather than attempting to capture them, leading to a [massive expansion](https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/14/kill-capture-obama-drone-pakistan-cia-policy-special-operations/) of the drone program.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Killing terror suspects in the field rather than capturing them means that they cannot be interrogated for useful information.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: Captured terror suspects often provide information which can lead to the successful capture of [other suspects](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2013/10/10/captures-vs-drones/).
1.8.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Drone strikes have led to high numbers of [civilian casualties](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-civilian-deaths-syria-iraq-middle-east-a7649486.html), depriving innocent people of their lives.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: While innocent people [have been detained](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13184845) at Guantanamo, they can be released once their innocence is proven. The fatal impact of drone strikes is irreversible.
1.8.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
