Discussion Title: Hosts outside of Westworld

1. Why are there seemingly no hosts outside of Westworld?
1.1. The park's creators exclusively hold the intellectual property to create hosts.
1.1.1. Pro: Delos - the park owner - tried to smuggle out confidential information about the creation of the hosts.
1.2. There are unclear risks involved with hosts being in the "real world".
1.2.1. Pro: The park is a strictly controlled environment. Any host malfunctioning \(which we have seen plenty of\) is a much bigger risk to humans if it lives outside the park.
1.3. There is no "outside of Westworld".
1.3.1. Con: Westworld appears to be an island as Maeve's narrative consist of a task '[Mainland Infiltration](https://moviepilot.com/p/things-you-might-have-missed-in-westworld-episode-ten/4161266)'.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Obviously the park has a beach and an ocean.
1.3.2. Con: The guests obviously come from "somewhere else".
1.3.2.1. Pro: In episode 2 the new guests enter Westworld by train. They are talking about Westworld being different, so they must have come from somewhere else.
1.3.3. Pro: We have not seen any "outside".
1.3.3.1. Con: The fact that the "outside" has not been seen does not necessarily mean it does not exist.
