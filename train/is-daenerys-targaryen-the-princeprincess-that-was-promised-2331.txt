Discussion Title: Is Daenerys Targaryen the Prince/Princess that was Promised?

1. Daenerys Targaryen is the Prince/Princess that was Promised
1.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that the prophecy of the Prince that was Promised is anything more than a myth.
1.1.1. Pro: George R. R. Martin has [suggested](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Religion) that there is no single "true" religion in Game of Thrones. Thus, there is little reason to believe that the prophecy of the Prince is true
1.1.1.1. Con: The prophecy is not necessarily tied to one religion being more true than others. Different religions might merely offer different perspectives on and interpretations of the same prophecy.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The prophecy of the Prince that was promised has a Valyrian origin; Azor Ahai is a tale from the religion surrounding R’hllor. The two originated in different geographical and cultural contexts yet they likely refer to the same prophecy.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: George R. R. Martin usually describes Azor Ahai as the one who wields the sword Lightbringer. On a [different occasion](https://youtu.be/DIe0Q3PgcOw?t=7m3s), he also described the Prince that was Promised as the one who owns Lightbringer. This indicates that both names refer to one and the same person.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Melisandre uses the names interchangeably.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Melisandre even directly mentions the two names in a single piece of dialogue: "It is the war for the dawn you speak of, my lady. But where is the prince that was promised?” “He stands before you,” Melisandre declared, “though you do not have the eyes to see. Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai come again, the warrior of fire. In him the prophecies are fulfilled."
1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Melisandre's opinions about the prophecy should not necessarily be trusted. She has been wrong about it before, namely believing that it referred to Stannis Baratheon.
1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Although Melisandre has been wrong about a particular application of the prophecy \(Stannis\), it is unlikely Melisandre would be wrong about the nature of the prophecy itself.
1.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: When Aemon asks Melisandre about the Prince that was promised, she answers by saying that "Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai come again". Among the characters most educated on these matters, the two names are thus treated as interchangeable.
1.1.1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.2.2.
1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The Westerosi myth of the [Last Hero](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Last_hero), who lived during the Long Night, could also refer to the Prince/Azor Ahai.
1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Maester Yandel made it clear that many cultures have mythical heroes who are presumably references to Azor Ahai: "How long the darkness endured no man can say, but all agree that it was only when a great warrior - known variously as Hyrkoon the Hero, Azor Ahai, Yin Tar, Neferion and Eldric Shadowchaser..."
1.1.1.1.2. Con: This could simply reflect the spread of similar myths among different cultures over a long history.
1.1.1.2. Con: George R. R. Martin could simply mean that all religions in Game of Thrones are rough and somewhat inaccurate approximations of real magic and prophecy. This leaves open the possibility that the Prince prophecy is true.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Martin is [an atheist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDaHSet6-SM) who discusses religion from a secular perspective.
1.1.1.4. Con: The Prince that was Promised is a secular prophecy. Magic exists in the world and some of it is clearly independent of divinity, and the rest is ambiguous in its connection. George R. R. Martin has said he's not sure if the Gods people believe in in Westeros actually exist, but magic certainly does, including prophecy.
1.1.2. Pro: Prophecies are a favourite cliche of epic fantasy stories - George R. R. Martin's tendency to deliberately abandon cliche and expectation could mean that the prophecies in Game of Thrones have no real significance.
1.1.2.1. Con: George R R Martin doesn't only abandon cliches, he also loves to subvert them. His other works show subversion of expectations, but generally not a simple empty rejection of them.
1.1.3. Con: Some prophecies in Game of Thrones have come true.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Melisandre makes various predictions which turn out to be true.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: She [predicts](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Melisandre#A_Storm_of_Swords) the deaths of Balon Greyjoy, Robb Stark, and Joffrey Baratheon.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: During the War of the Five Kings, it was a safe bet to say that many of the kings would die. This does not necessarily reflect magical foresight.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: She [predicts](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Melisandre#A_Dance_with_Dragons) the deaths of several of Jon's rangers, and the arrival of Alys Karstark to the Wall.
1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Melisandre [predicts](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Prophecies/Entry/5438) Jon's murder, warning him repeatedly of "daggers in the dark."
1.1.3.1.4. Con: Melisandre also makes all sorts of false predictions. She falsely believes that Stannis is the Prince, and fails to foresee major events like Stannis's loss at Blackwater Bay.
1.1.3.1.4.1. Con: Melisandre has a vision of someone in green armor \(she thinks it's Renly\) defeating Stannis's forces at King's Landing. This vision does comes true, even though the person in the armour is actually Garlan Tyrell.
1.1.3.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.4.1.
1.1.3.2. Pro: The woods witches have a good record in terms of correctly predicting future events.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Maggy the Frog accurately predicted to Cersei that she would marry Robert and not Rhaegar \("the King and not the Prince"\), and that she would have three children and outlive them all.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: The Ghost of the High Heart prophesizes the deaths of Renly Barathon and Balon Greyjoy, the resurrection of Catelyn Stark, as well as the Red Wedding and the Purple Wedding.
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Mother Mole predicts that ships would carry the wildlings from Hardhome to safety across the sea, which does in fact happen after Jon Snow and Tormund arrive there.
1.1.4. Con: The faith of R'hllor refers to the Prince, and priests of R'hllor have performed many magical acts. This suggests that there is some truth to their religion.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Melisandre resurrects Jon Snow and Thoros of Myr resurrects Beric Dondarrion.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Melisandre makes magical illusions: for example, the illusion she uses to conceal her old age, or the illusion she uses to make the wildling Rattleshirt look like Mance Rayder.
1.1.4.3. Con: Even if priests of R'Hllor can perform acts of magic, this does not necessarily indicate that the religion is true. They could simply be tapping into some kind of magical power, and interpreting it as coming from a god.
1.1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.1.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.1.5. Con: Many sources, from different religious traditions, speak of similar prophecies. This might indicate that it is more than a myth.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Azor Ahai is a mythical figure from the faith of R'hllor. The term is assumed to refer to the same figure as the prophecy of the Prince.
1.1.5.2. Pro: There is substantial evidence that the prophecy of the Prince originated in Valyria.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Knowledge of the prophecy is [most common](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Prince_That_Was_Promised) in the eastern parts of Essos, which is geographically near Valyria.
1.1.5.2.2. Pro: The prophecy refers to House Targaryen, which at the time was a Valyrian house.
1.1.5.2.3. Pro: The prophecy is usually recited in High Valyrian.
1.1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.4.
1.1.6. Con: A recurrent theme of Game of Thrones is that supposed "myths" which are dismissed by most characters turn out to be true.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Most characters south of the Wall initially dismiss claims about the existence of White Walkers or wights. People like Old Nan, who are seen as spouting old myths, turn out to be right.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: When Jeor Mormont first mentions the sightings of White Walkers, Tyrion Lannister dismisses this and refers to Merlings instead, to make fun of Jeor's suggestion.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Characters even refuse to believe direct testimony about White Walkers. When Luwin, the Maester of Winterfell, is told by captured wildlings about the White Walkers, he dismisses these reports as he assumes that they are all dead.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Eddard Stark, though ruling over the North, believes that the White Walkers "are as dead as the Children of the Forest, gone eight thousand years".
1.1.6.2. Pro: Old Nan's children's tales about the Long Night \(the initial war between the White Walkers and humans\) and the ancient history of Westeros are actually surprisingly accurate. The prophecy of the Prince is a similar story about the history of the Long Night; it is therefore plausibly also true.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Even if the Prince was a real historical figure, this does not imply that a prophecy about his resurrection is true.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: Many elements of the Azor Ahai \(who is supposedly the same person as the Prince\) prophecy are clearly fantastical: for example, that he laboured over the creation of his sword Lightbringer for 50 days and 50 nights.
1.1.6.3. Con: This is true about pieces of folk wisdom, not prophecy or religions' claims. The overarching theme could be: oral traditions of recounting history are accurate, but religious claims are not.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.1.6.3.2. Con: [Worshippers](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Priestess) of the [Lord of Light](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/R%27hllor) can bring back people back to life if the Lord of Light wishes it so. Regardless of whether there truly is a Lord of Light, resurrection through a rite of fire is a religious myth that turns out to be true. This prophecy is given a lot of merit and adherence in this religion, where at least Melisandre is confirmed to be able to look into the future.
1.1.6.4. Pro: Many characters dismiss reports about the existence of Daenerys's dragons as myth.
1.1.6.4.1. Con: There is little reason to dismiss the existence of dragons as a myth as they feature prominently in the lore of Westeros, for example during Aegon's conquest.
1.1.6.4.1.1. Con: Dragons had been extinct in Westeros since the reign of Aegon III Targaryen in 157AL. This meant that when Daenerys' dragons were born no dragon had been seen alive in well over a century meaning their reappearance was certainly surprising even if their existence was not unprecedented.
1.1.7. Pro: There are various thematic narratives that could support the prophecy being a myth. For example, the message might be that instead of trusting in a single mythical hero, humanity needs to collectivize to defeat threats.
1.1.8. Con: Quotes from George R. R. Martin suggest that the prophecy is true in some sense.
1.1.8.1. Pro: George R. R. Martin [himself said](http://www.adriasnews.com/2012/10/george-r-r-martin-interview.html?spref=tw) "Prophecies are, you know, a double edge sword. You have to handle them very carefully; I mean, they can add depth and interest to a book, but you don’t want to be too literal or too easy."
1.1.9. Pro: George R. R. Martin approaches religion from a secular, anthropological perspective. Different faiths, like the Faith of the Seven, the faith of the Lord of Light, or the faith of the Old Gods, rise and fall for sociological and historical factors, not factors relating to their truth.
1.1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.2. Pro: Several characters in the books and the TV series support this interpretation.
1.2.1. Pro: Maester Aemon concludes that "Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it."
1.2.1.1. Con: Maester Aemon previously believed that Rhaegar was the Prince that was Promised. The fact that he has changed his mind on who it is throughout his life may take away from his final claim.
1.2.1.2. Con: Aemon spoke these words on his deathbed. They may merely be the last mumblings of a dying man.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: The last words of the dying are typically expressed as a high form of wisdom in fiction.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Aemon apparently experienced hallucinations while dying, talking to his dead brother Aegon \(to whom he refers by his youth name "Egg"\).
1.2.2. Pro: Melisandre expresses that either Daenerys or Jon Snow could be the Prince that was Promised.
1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.4.
1.2.3. Con: Characters in the series are easily fallible, and may only be making these proclamations for personal or political gain. Their opinions are not strong evidence.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Game of Thrones is known for the complex political games its characters play; none of them should be assumed to be genuine or honest on the face of it.
1.2.4. Pro: Benerro, the high priest at the Red Temple of Volantis, proclaimed Daenerys to be Azor Ahai returned.
1.2.4.1. Con: This characteristic refers to the prophecy of Azor Ahai. It is by no means clear that Azor Ahai is the same as the Prince that was Promised.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.2.
1.2.4.1.3. Pro: While talking to Stannis, Melisandre explicitly says that the Prince that was Promised will stand against the Others: "You are he who must stand against the Other. The one whose coming was prophesied five thousand years ago. The red comet was your herald. You are the prince that was promised, and if you fail the world fails with you."
1.2.4.1.4. Pro: The Azor Ahai reborn prophecy has different prerequisites: that it happen after a long summer; that there will be a bleeding star; and that the warrior draw Lightbringer from fire. While the two are commonly associated, if the two were in fact separate prophecies, they could apply to different people and help resolve the ambiguities around the multiple contenders for who is the Prince.
1.3. Con: Daenerys being the Prince is the most obvious outcome; this actually makes it less likely to be the case.
1.3.1. Pro: George R.R. Martin is known for surprising readers and for subverting traditional narratives. Having Daenerys, one of the series' primary main characters, be the Princess that was Promised would be perhaps the most conventional outcome, and is, therefore, less likely.
1.3.1.1. Con: The fact that Daenerys is the obvious outcome indicates that there is substantial evidence for Daenerys being the Prince. George R. R. Martin would be unlikely to disregard all of this evidence simply in order to be contrarian.
1.3.1.2. Con: Game of Thrones, vaguely [based](https://www.livescience.com/44599-medieval-reality-game-of-thrones.html) on [medieval](http://www.historyextra.com/article/premium/game-thrones-based-on-real-medieval-inspiration) times, has been dominated by powerful male characters. The fact that a female character ends up being the Princess is, in this particular narrative and in most, a surprising reversal of narrative tropes.
1.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.3.2. Pro: Melisandre and Tyrion both warn against interpreting prophecies too clearly. That Daenerys so obviously fits the criteria makes its truth suspect.
1.3.3. Con: If Daenerys being the Prince would be the obvious outcome, it would have made little sense for George R. R. Martin to spend significant space and effort on important characters coming to different conclusions, for example Aemon, Melisandre and Stannis. Daenerys being the Prince, thus, was anything but an obvious outcome.
1.3.3.1. Pro: For characters like Aemon and probably the audience it was a surprise to realize that the prophecy of the Prince does not necessarily refer to a male prince but can also be understood as referring to a princess.
1.3.3.2. Con: On the contrary, to avoid the story being too obvious, it is fair to assume that Geroge R.R. Martin used other characters as red herrings to mask his ultimate intention of making Daenerys the Princess.
1.3.4. Con: The revelations about Jon Snow’s origins make him the most obvious character to be the Prince.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Jon is the only one who, metaphorically, unites ice and fire: he is the only descendant of both House Stark and House Targaryen, who formed the so-called Pact of Ice and Fire during the Dance of the Dragons.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: The words of the two houses are direct references to ice and fire: "Winter is Coming" for House Stark and "Fire and Blood" for House Targaryen.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: Melisandre states that she has "done \[her\] part; I've bought ice and fire together” when Jon meets Daenerys; clearly referring to those phenomena as representing each person.
1.3.4.2. Con: Daenarys and Jon both fit the prophecy the best out of the characters in the books. Due to the development of their relationship there is the possibility their child could be the Prince that was Promised.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: If this were to be the case the books would have to skip ahead a number of years in order for the child to be old enough to aid in the fight against darkness.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Their child would be from the correct lineage for the prophecy, from the bloodline of Rhaella and Aerys II Targaryen.
1.3.4.2.3. Pro: Their child would be born of a song of Ice and Fire, Jon being Ice and Daenarys being Fire.
1.3.4.2.4. Pro: The child would be born at the beginning of a winter after a long summer.
1.3.5. Pro: Daenerys fits too neatly into the prophecy and her rebirth happens too early on for her to be The Prince that was promised. It does not fit into the Game of Thrones style to be predictable.
1.3.6. Con: It's an obvious outcome because the TV series is building up to that outcome in its last season. The TV series needs lengthier predictability than the novels do to safeguard [suspension of disbelief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief).
1.4. Pro: The woods witch, in a separate prophecy, mentions that the Prince would be born from the bloodline of Rhaella and Aerys II Targaryen.
1.4.1. Con: The woods witch may be mistaken; she is not the source of the original prophecy.
1.4.2. Pro: Daenerys is the daughter of Rhaella and Aerys II Targaryen.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Furthermore, Daenerys is the only living person of direct descendancy from Rhaella and Aerys. In the case of Jon Snow, who is also part of their bloodline, Rhaella and Aerys are merely the grandparents \(with Rhaegar in-between\).
1.4.2.1.1. Con: A grandchild is part of the bloodline of his/her "mere grandparents."
1.4.2.1.2. Con: This proposition is weakened by the other characters it could apply to just as well as Daenerys. Rhaegar Targaryen, Jon Snow \(son of Rhaegar\), and Aegon Targaryen \(if he's legitimate\) would also be of the proper bloodline.
1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: Aegon is probably alive in the books.
1.4.2.1.2.2. Pro: This is also true of Jon Snow. Because Jon's true father was Rhaegar Targaryen, his paternal grandparents are Rhaella and Aerys II.
1.4.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: At least in the show, Jon is [confirmed](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/game-of-thrones-season-7-hbo-confirms-jon-snow-s-parents-with-family-tree-infographic-a7110511.html) to be the son of Rhaegar.
1.4.2.1.2.3. Pro: It is also possible that Tyrion is a secret son of Aerys II.
1.4.2.1.2.3.1. Con: While this might connect Tyrion to Aerys II, it does not establish a link to Rhaella. The prophecy mentions the Prince as being born from the bloodline of both. Yet Tyrion's mother is Joanna Lannister \(and not a Targaryen\).
1.4.2.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Rhaella and Aerys II were siblings; thus they each have identical bloodlines. Being the son of only one of them could still be interpreted as being of that same bloodline.
1.4.2.1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Jaehaerys II Targaryen arranged the marriage between Rhaella and Aerys II once he heard that the Prince that was Promised would be born from their line. If being the child of one of them would be sufficient, there would have been no need to arrange their marriage.
1.4.2.1.2.3.2. Con: Tyrion has no direct connection or interest in the fight against the White Walkers. It would moreover be contrary to his cynical, nihilistic character for him to be a grand, save-the-world hero.
1.4.2.1.2.3.2.1. Con: Tyrion's character arc has been edging towards being less cynical and nihilistic. His allegiance with Daenerys seems premised on a trust that her rule would be best for Westeros.
1.4.2.1.2.3.3. Pro: Tyrion was able to face down Daenerys' dragons. Being able to tame dragons is a trait that requires \(or is strongly helped by\) having Targaryen ancestry.
1.4.2.1.2.3.3.1. Pro: The use of magic is strongly tied to bloodlines, such as the Stark's ties to the First Men and their associated warging ability.
1.4.2.1.2.3.3.2. Pro: The introduction to the Sworn Sword contains "The lords freeholder of Valyria ruled the greater part of the known world; they were sorcerers, great in lore, and alone of all the races of man they had learned to breed dragons and bend them to their will."
1.4.2.1.2.3.3.3. Pro: Aemond Targaryen tamed a full-grown dragon as a ten year old; a feat that is improbable without some sort of affinity deriving from his ancestry.
1.4.2.1.2.3.3.4. Con: There are plenty of other explanations for why the dragons did not attack Tyrion.
1.4.2.1.2.3.3.4.1. Pro: The dragons are described as intelligent by Tyrion himself. Thus, they might be able to differentiate between friend and foe.
1.4.2.1.2.3.3.4.1.1. Pro: In fact, Tyrion assures them that he is a friend of Daenerys and came to help them.
1.4.2.1.2.3.3.4.2. Pro: Missandei, before Tyrion's encounter with the dragons, told him that they had never hurt her. This indicates that they are not necessarily aggressive.
1.4.2.1.2.3.3.4.3. Pro: Tyrion did not pose any threat to the dragons whatsoever.
1.4.2.1.2.3.3.4.4. Pro: The dragons had been kept in captivity for some time and were not well-fed. This leaves the possibility that they were in a weak state.
1.4.2.1.2.3.3.4.4.1. Con: This would also mean that they would be especially likely to devour any visitors for sustenance.
1.4.2.1.2.3.3.5. Pro: Tyrion also could be considered as having "woken the dragons from stone" when he released them from their captivity inside the \(presumably stone\) ziggurat.
1.4.2.1.2.3.4. Pro: There is textual evidence of an affair between Aerys II and Joanna: "... the marriage between Aerys II Targaryen and his sister, Rhaella, was not as happy; though she turned a blind eye to most of the king's infidelities, the queen did not approve of his turning my ladies into his whores. \(Joanna Lannister was not the first lady to be dismissed abruptly from Her Grace's service, nor was she the last\)".
1.4.2.1.2.3.5. Pro: Dwarf babies are indistinguishable from non-dwarf babies, yet Tywin hated Tyrion from the start: "The day that you were born I wanted to carry you in to the sea and let the waves wash you away, Instead I let you live, and I brought you up as my son"
1.4.2.1.2.3.6. Pro: Tywin's last words were "You are no son of mine." Earlier he said: "Men’s laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors, since I cannot prove that you are not mine."
1.4.2.1.2.3.6.1. Con: Tywin could instead be using his last words as a rhetorical way of expressing the fact that Tyrion has unforgivably betrayed him and the Lannister family.
1.4.2.1.2.3.6.2. Con: Tywin's earlier statement is compatible with Tyrion being his son; it is not conclusive proof.
1.4.2.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.4.2.1.2.5. Pro: [George R. R. Martin](https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Rhaegar-Targaryen-Azor-Ahai-Game-Thrones-Theory-43888003?utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=US:IE&utm_source=www.google.ie) has talked about wanting to write a fantasy novel where the hero dies or loses at the beginning and the rest of the story is the aftermath. If this is to be taken as true for Game of Thrones Rhaegar may have been the Prince that was Promised but died before the books began.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1. Pro: Under this interpretation Rhaegar becomes a likely candidate for being the Prince, if we interpret Jon as the weapon. Like Azor Ahai, Rhaegar in effect sacrificed his wife to bring forth Jon/Lightbringer.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Jon was Rhaegar's third child and so his third attempt just as Lightbringer was Azor's third attempt.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.3. Pro: If Jon eventually comes to ride Rheagal into battle this could be interpreted as Rheagar going into battle with Jon, Azor with Lightbringer.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: Rhaegal could be a reincarnation of Rhaegar.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: When Daenerys was brought into the tent where the blood magic was happening, Daenerys had access to the world of the dead through the shadows dancing. Rhaego died and Daenerys could have been a vessel for the souls of Rhaegar, Viserys and Rhaego. With her sacrifice she may have transfered the souls of her dead relations to the dragons.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The idea of Drogon having Rhaego's soul fits in with Daenerys's prophetic dreams. If he was brought into Drogon the other dragons would have needed a soul/spirit too. Dead blood relatives of Daenerys's would have had a closer connection to her.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: In one of Daenerys's dreams her tights are red with blood and a dragon which greatly resembles Drogon appears covered in her blood. This forshadows the death of Rhaego and connects it with Drogon's birth.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: The Dosh khaleen also have prophesied this; they told Daenerys she would birth the stallion that mounts the world. Drogon acts as Daenerys's stallion and has the potential to mount the earth.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Daenerys dreams often of Rhaegar which could point to a connection between the two of them which would have allowed her to use his soul in this way.
1.4.2.1.2.5.1.3.1.1.3. Con: The possibility of such a 'soul transfer' is highly speculative and is without precedent in other parts of the Game of Thrones story.
1.4.2.1.2.5.2. Pro: Rhaegar was born at Summerhall on the same day it burned down, meaning he was born amidst salt and smoke. Smoke from the fire and salt from the tears of the people.
1.4.2.1.2.5.2.1. Con: There was no star bleeding when Rheagar was born.
1.4.2.1.2.5.3. Pro: Rhaegar is literally a prince and so fits the prophecy perfectly. He is a prince who was promised.
1.4.2.1.2.5.4. Pro: Maester Aemon believed that Rhaegar was Azor Ahai. It is mentioned in the books that even Rhaegar was convinced of this for some time.
1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.
1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.5. Pro: The prophecy mentions that the Prince would be born "when the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers".
1.5.1. Con: Jon Snow could also be considered as reborn under these circumstances.
1.5.1.1. Pro: "The darkness gathers" is very easily interpreted as the presence of the White Walkers who were very close to Jon when he was reborn.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Ser Patrek's sigil contained stars, and his body was bleeding as he was killed while Jon was being born.
1.5.1.3. Pro: During his resurrection, Melisandre wears her red necklace which could be considered as a 'red star'.
1.5.2. Con: The prophecy states that Azor Ahai will only be reborn after the end of a "long summer" and when "an evil, cold darkness descends upon the world". At the time of Daenerys' birth/rebirth neither had come to pass.
1.5.2.1. Con: Daenerys' rebirth happens around the time when the Night's Watch becomes aware that the White Walkers are approaching. This fits the idea behind the phrase "darkness gathers".
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Khal Drogo dies in 298 or 299 AC; Daenerys is reborn shortly afterwards. The same year, the Night's Watch loses several hundred men to wights commanded by the White Walkers in the [Fight at the Fist](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Fight_at_the_Fist).
1.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.5.2.3. Con: All events within Game of Thrones happen within several years of Daenerys's rebirth. This seems like a a sufficiently close time frame for the prophecy to apply.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: The prophecy is about the rebirth of a hero from thousands of years ago. A few years should not make much difference to the timing.
1.5.2.4. Pro: The original Azor Ahai obtained his heroic status, and forged Lightbringer, in the middle of an invasion of the Others. This indicates that the rebirth of Azor Ahai should happen once the Others have invaded, not several years before.
1.5.2.5. Pro: In the TV series, the White Walkers just breached the Wall, and Daenerys and Jon Snow just had sex. This timing may indicate that the prophecy is about their future child, who could be considered a song of fire \(Daenerys\) and ice \(Jon\).
1.5.2.6. Pro: The White Walkers — presumably the "evil, cold darkness" — have yet to seriously threaten Westeros itself, or at least only did so after Daenerys was born or emerged from the funeral pyre.
1.5.2.6.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.1.
1.5.2.7. Pro: The official arrival of winter in Westeros happened long after Daenerys was either born or reborn.
1.5.2.7.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.1.
1.5.2.7.2. Pro: Only at the end of season 6 does Sansa declare that "winter has come". This implies that the arrival of winter takes place much later than Daenerys' birth or rebirth.
1.5.2.8. Pro: If/when Azor Ahai is reborn into one of the existing characters it would likely be an obvious event in the text. Until that happens no character can be reliably said to be the 'prince that was promised'.
1.5.3. Con: If Daenerys' birth is taken to be her initial birth on Dragonstone, then she satisfies the "salt and smoke" component of the prophecy, but not the "red star" one. Alternatively, her rebirth from the pyre satisfies "red star" but not "salt and smoke." Either way, she does not satisfy all of the conditions.
1.5.3.1. Con: Daenerys is reborn as the Mother of Dragons out of the smoke of Khal Drogo's funeral pyre with salty tears in her eyes.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: There is precedent for the idea that tears are sufficient to satisfy the saltwater requirement. Maester Aemon [believed](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_prince_that_was_promised) that Rhaegar was the Prince, with the tears of those at Summerhall being the saltwater.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Daenerys was also reborn in the sense that she changed from being a follower to being a leader and having undergone this rite of passage.
1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.5.5. Con: The prophecy has been shared over a long period of time. We cannot be certain that we and the characters in the books have the correct wording and understanding of it.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Melisandre repeatedly reinterprets sections of the prophecy when her favoured candidates, like Stannis, turn out not to be the Prince. This indicates that the prophecy does not have a single clear or straightforward meaning.
1.5.6. Pro: During Daenerys' rebirth on the funeral pyre of Khal Drogo, a red comet crosses the sky.
1.5.6.1. Pro: The Dothraki refer to the comet as "shierak qiya", which translates as "Bleeding Star" and matches the words of the prophecy.
1.6. Pro: According to the prophecy, the Prince would be born out of "salt and smoke".
1.6.1. Pro: Daenerys was born on Dragonstone, a volcanic island \(smoke\) in the middle of the sea \(salt\).
1.6.1.1. Pro: According to Stannis Baratheon's maester, Dragonstone is "a lonely citadel in the wet waste surrounded by storm and salt", which sounds a lot like smoke and salt.
1.6.1.2. Con: At least metaphorically, the same logic can apply to Stannis Baratheon. While he was not literally born on Dragonstone, he was made Prince of Dragonstone - and thereby "reborn" as the traditional heir of the Iron Throne.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: Viewing an appointment to an office as a "rebirth" is a stretch of interpretation.
1.6.1.3. Pro: Melisandre argues in a conversation with Davos that "Dragonstone is the place of smoke and salt".
1.6.1.4. Pro: There was a storm raging when she was born; adding credence to the 'salt' part of her birth prophecy. She is even called Stormborn.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.
1.6.3. Con: Tyrion could also be considered as having been reborn amidst salt and smoke during the Blackwater battle.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Even if not literally reborn, the battle was a turning point in Tyrion's character arc where he chose bravery and direct action: "As they need to hold the river at all costs, Tyrion decides to lead the next sortie himself. Shamed into action by the dwarf's display of courage, several defenders gather to Tyrion's side."
1.6.3.2. Con: Tyrion's experiences on the Blackwater are just a wound and a period of unconsciousness — they are nowhere near as significant as the rebirths experienced by Jon and Daenerys.
1.6.4. Con: Jon Snow could also reborn out of "salt and smoke" when revived at Castle Black or when initially born.
1.6.4.1. Pro: At the time of his resurrection Bowen Marsh was crying \(salt\) and Jon's wounds were described as 'smoking' \(fire\).
1.6.4.2. Pro: At the time of his birth Ned Stark was teary and the smoke could be considered as the concealment of his true parentage.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.1.
1.6.4.3. Pro: We have little information about the exact circumstances of Jon's initial birth in the Tower of Joy. For all we know, it could have involved salt and smoke.
1.6.4.4. Con: Salt is at best tangentially related to the circumstances of Jon's birth \(or rebirth\).
1.6.4.5. Pro: The Tower of Joy \(where Jon was born\) is near the sea.
1.6.4.6. Pro: Melisandre very deliberately burns some of Jon's hair during her resurrection spell.
1.6.4.6.1. Con: The prophecy is probably about naturally occurring conditions, not deliberately manufactured ones.
1.6.4.6.2. Con: Fire is important to most rituals involving R'hllor; the use of fire need not relate to the prophecy.
1.6.4.6.3. Con: Both of these things were done by Melisandre who has a habit of creating the conditions of the prophecy such as with Stannis. It would be stronger proof if these aspects had naturally occurred.
1.6.4.7. Pro: At the time of his resurrection his hair was scorched \(fire\) and his body washed with water \(salt\).
1.6.4.7.1. Con: The water was probably not saltwater, given the abundance of freshwater and the distance from Castle Black to the sea.
1.6.4.7.1.1. Con: The spell itself could have explicitly required salt water.
1.6.4.7.1.2. Con: If the water melted off the wall there is reason to believe the wall itself is salted to lower its freezing point or to ward off evil. Bran, while at the base of the wall, notes: "The door's upper lip brushed against the top of Bran's head and a drop of water fell on him ... it was strangely warm, and salty as a tear."
1.6.4.7.1.2.1. Con: Saltwater cannot freeze; only the water part freezes, and the salt is pushed out.
1.6.4.7.2. Con: -> See 1.6.4.6.3.
1.6.4.8. Pro: At the time of his resurrection Melisandre \(fire\) and Ser Davos \(salt\) were present.
1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.5.3.
1.6.6. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.6.7. Con: This characteristic could refer to a great many characters who are connected to the sea, which obviously provides salt and smoke \(possibly in the form of fog\), for example Ser Davos.
1.6.8. Pro: The prophecy never says that the salt and smoke have to be at the same time. Daenarys has been born twice. Her original birth could be salt, when she is born at Dragonstone surrounded by salty seas and her rebirth is the smoke when she emerged from the funeral pyre unburned.
1.6.9. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.7. Pro: The prophecy describes the Prince as the one to "wake dragons out of stone".
1.7.1. Con: "Waking dragons" has been used metaphorically in the past \(most notably by Viserys, to refer to his own anger\). It need not be taken literally.
1.7.2. Pro: For Aemon, the dragons are the one crucial proof for Daenerys being the Prince: "Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it."
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.7.4. Pro: Melisandre also states that "only a king's blood can wake the stone dragon" which seems obviously tied to this prophecy. In which case Daenerys' sacrifice of Khal Drogo ties into that requirement and thus the wider prophecy.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.3.3.5.
1.7.6. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.7.7. Con: This part of the prophecy is very literal and can be easily tied to a major and obvious event \(i.e. Daenerys' dragons\). Prophecies are rarely that easily interpreted.
1.7.8. Pro: Daenerys receives three fossilized dragon eggs from which she hatches her three dragons.
1.7.9. Con: "Dragons" can also be interpreted to mean "Targaryens" rather than the literal creatures.
1.7.9.1. Con: It is not clear what "waking Targaryens out of stone" would involve.
1.7.9.1.1. Con: "Waking dragons out of stone" could refer to simply bringing the Targaryen house back from the brink of ruin.
1.8. Con: The prophecy describes the Prince as forging and wielding a flaming weapon: the Lightbringer. Daenerys does not wield a weapon.
1.8.1. Pro: 'Lightbringer' could also be interepreted as referring to the Night's Watch — their oath includes "I am the sword in the darkness" as well as "\(I am\) the light that brings the dawn."
1.8.2. Pro: Jon Snow had a dream where he was fighting White Walkers while "his blade burned red in his fist."
1.8.3. Pro: Sandor Clegane, who shares [some of the characteristics](https://winteriscoming.net/2017/07/21/game-of-thrones-theory-is-the-hound-the-true-prince-that-was-promised/) of the Prince that was Promised, serves in the Brotherhood without Banners, alongside Beric Dondarrion, who uses a flaming sword. Given some of his other characteristics and his proximity to this weapon, he has a chance of being the Prince that was Promised.
1.8.3.1. Pro: The Hound's redemption story arc makes him particularly suitable to be a surprise candidate for the role of the Prince that was Promised.
1.8.3.2. Con: The Hound is a relatively mundane character, with no special family background or abilities. This makes it unlikely that a supernatural prophecy refers to him.
1.8.3.3. Con: The same logic could be used to support the argument that Jon is the Prince. After all, he has teamed up with Clegane and Beric, thus fighting alongside the man with the flaming sword.
1.8.4. Con: Lightbringer could be interpreted as being a person, rather than as a literal weapon.
1.8.4.1. Pro: Prophecies are meant to be mysterious, and as such their components shouldn't be interpreted literally. It is likely that the reincarnation of Lightbringer will not be a literal weapon.
1.8.4.2. Con: The legend of the Lightbringer involves a relatively lengthy story of how the sword was forged. This makes it likely that the legend does refer to an actual sword.
1.8.4.3. Con: Melisandre, who is familiar with the prophecy, equipped Stannis Baratheon with an actual sword when she believed him to be the Prince. This indicates that the prophecy refers to an actual sword.
1.8.4.3.1. Con: Given Melisandre was wrong about the recipient of that sword, she could easily be wrong on this front also.
1.8.4.3.2. Con: Melisandre was only recently corrected in her translation of the prophecy in the TV show. The sword may be another example of differing translations.
1.8.4.4. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.5.1.
1.8.4.5. Pro: If Daenarys gets pregnant and dies in childbirth, the child of Jon and her could be the sword. The sword must be infused with someone's soul and someone must die in its creation.
1.8.5. Pro: Daenerys has also never received training in martial weapons, so it is unlikely that she will use a sword in the future.
1.8.5.1. Con: While she may not be wielding an actual sword, Daenerys is still a warrior queen who commands armies and a flotilla and has captured numerous lands and cities. Thus, she wields a different kind of weapon.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: The prophecy seems to refer to a literal weapon, not a metaphorical exercise of military power.
1.8.5.2. Con: Daenerys is around 22 in the show at this point - hardly too old to pick up a new skill.
1.8.5.2.1. Pro: Plenty of other fantasy series have characters developing substantial proficiency with a sword around a similar age - for example, Rand al'Thor in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, or Garion in David Eddings' Belgariad.
1.8.6. Pro: Beric Dondarrion wields an actual flaming sword, which he uses to fight the undead, and is more likely to be the Prince than Daenerys.
1.8.6.1. Pro: Beric has been repeatedly resurrected by the Lord of Light, indicating that he occupies some sort of special religious purpose.
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: Thoros, the priest who repeatedly resurrects Beric, states that "the Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
1.8.6.2. Pro: Beric is a relatively minor character, so having him be the Prince would fit George R. R. Martin's typical practice of subverting expectations.
1.8.6.3. Con: Beric has already experienced his final death in the books. It is unlikely that he would fill a central role for the story line in the TV series after being written out of the plot by George R. R. Martin.
1.8.6.3.1. Con: Beric's death in the books occurs a few days after the Red Wedding when he gives his life to resurrect Catelyn Stark. This point has long passed in the series, hence it can be assumed that Beric plays a different role on TV than in the books.
1.8.6.3.2. Pro: While the show has regularly diverted from the books, it would be an unprecedented diversion for the two works to have such radically different heroes and endings.
1.8.6.3.2.1. Pro: The show has largely cut plotlines, rather than changing those it has kept.
1.8.6.4. Con: Beric has no connection to either dragons or the Targaryen bloodline, both of which are assumed to be a central characteristic of the Prince.
1.8.6.5. Con: Beric is a relatively minor character who might not even be instantly familiar to many who watch only the series. This makes it unlikely that he fulfills a role as important as that of the Prince that was Promised.
1.8.6.6. Con: Thoros also wields a similar flaming sword; this indicates that Beric's powers are not particularly unique.
1.8.6.7. Pro: Unlike other characters like Jon or Daenerys, who have many other motives and goals, Beric seems singlemindedly devoted to destroying the White Walkers. This fits the persona of the Prince.
1.8.6.8. Con: George R. R. Martin has stated [in an interview](http://uproxx.com/tv/game-of-thrones-fire-wights/) that Beric is de-facto not any different from the undead he fights, only that his body is animated by fire rather than ice. It is unlikely that a undead character would be the storyline's savior.
1.8.7. Con: It's entirely possible that Daenerys will forge — either literally or figuratively — her own Lightbringer, and she simply hasn't yet.
1.8.7.1. Pro: If Lightbringer is to be a literal sword it has yet to make an appearance in the books. So it can be assumed it has not been forged yet.
1.8.7.2. Pro: If this is the case Jon could be her Nissa Nissa. He's got Kingsblood and as a likely fire [wight](https://www.google.ie/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview) he's got fire magic in his blood, so it makes sense for him to be a prime sacrifice for a magical enchantment.
1.8.7.2.1. Pro: In [interviews](http://time.com/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview/) George R. R. Martin has talked about Beric and Jon's coming back from the dead as similar. Beric is a confirmed fire wright and so it could be assumed that Jon is also.
1.8.7.3. Con: -> See 1.8.5.
1.8.8. Con: -> See 1.5.5.
1.8.9. Pro: Jon Snow is an experienced swordsman and already wields a special weapon that could be interpreted as \(or could become\) [Lightbringer](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer).
1.8.9.1. Pro: Jon's sword is Valyrian steel, which has special White Walker-killing properties. This makes it a good candidate for a mystical sword that fights White Walkers.
1.8.9.2. Pro: Jon's sword is passed down to him by the previous Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, an organisation dedicated to fighting White Walkers. This imbues the sword with special significance regarding White Walkers.
1.8.9.2.1. Con: Jon's sword is a Mormont family sword; it has not been in the Night's Watch for very long.
1.8.9.3. Pro: The thing which makes Lightbringer magical is what it was tempered in. If Jon uses his sword to kill Euron \(the water\), Cersei \(the lion\) and then Daenerys \(his wife\) he would be able turn his sword into a new version of Lightbringer.
1.8.9.3.1. Pro: Daenerys as someone associated with fire could plausibly give a sword fire powers if her soul was infused in it.
1.8.9.3.2. Con: Jon has not killed any of those three characters, making this highly speculative.
1.8.9.4. Pro: In the prophecy, the Prince is foretold to "pull a sword named Lightbringer from flames". Before his sword \(at the moment named [Longclaw](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Longclaw)\) was given to Jon, it was in a [fire](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Longclaw#A_Game_of_Thrones), after which the hilt was replaced to portray a wolf.
1.8.10. Con: A flaming weapon could be interpreted as a reference to Daenerys' fire-breathing dragons.
1.8.10.1. Con: The original Lightbringer was only forged after two failed attempts. Daenerys did not have a similar experience hatching her dragons.
1.8.10.1.1. Con: The part where Lightbringer is forged from the sacrifice of a loved one might be the more relevant part of the prophecy than the failed attempts.
1.8.10.1.2. Con: Neither did Stannis Baratheon have this experience when he received the sword that was supposed to be the Lightbringer - crucially, under the guidance of Melisandre who is familiar with the prophecy.
1.8.10.1.3. Con: Daenerys places the eggs in the fire on at least one earlier occasion, only for nothing to happen. This would reflect attempts without sacrifice failing, only to succeed when she sacrificed her spouse.
1.8.10.1.4. Con: One of her dragons has died already. If a second dragon dies, this could be interpreted as two failed attempts; rendering the last dragon to serve as the Lightbringer.
1.8.10.2. Pro: Xaro Xhoan Daxos, a trader whom Daenerys meets in Qarth, describes the dragons as "death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world".
1.8.10.2.1. Con: There is no reason to assume that Xaro has any particular insight into the nature of dragons or the myth of Lightbringer, and that this quote is more than a figure of speech.
1.8.11. Con: Azor Ahai forged Lightbringer by killing his wife. Daenerys' dragons were also brought into the world by the sacrifice of Khal Drogo and her unborn child.
1.8.11.1. Con: Daenerys didn't deliberately sacrifice Khal Drogo. If anything she did the opposite: tried to keep him alive no matter the cost.
1.8.11.1.1. Con: While he is dead when the pyre is lit, he is dead at her hands.
1.8.11.2. Con: The ritual involving Daenerys's child was probably not related to the religion of the Lord of Light, which the prophecy relates to.
1.8.11.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.9. Con: In Daenerys' vision Rhaegar Targaryen describes the story of the Prince that was Promised as "The Song of Ice and Fire". This does not fit Daenerys.
1.9.1. Con: Rhaegar's words are of dubious value as they were probably more driven by wishful thinking than actual insight.
1.9.1.1. Pro: In Daenerys' vision, Rhaegar describes his son Aegon as the Prince that was Promised. This was obviously not the case as Aegon was murdered while still a child.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.1.
1.9.1.2. Pro: Rhaegar initially believed that he would be the Prince. When no indications for this surfaced, he came to believe that the prophecy of the Prince referred to three people, hence he named his first two children after the three dragon-riders of the Targaryens. This indicates wishful thinking on his side.
1.9.1.3. Con: The words are not necessarily Rhaegar's actual words; they are just part of a vision. It could be that the illusion of Rhaegar is just being used as a visual tool to transmit information.
1.9.1.3.1. Pro: Rhaegar speaks these words in a vision that Daenerys has while in the House of the Undying. After she has the vision, the Undying Ones attack Daenerys. It is unclear whether the visions she has are reliable, and specific details in the visions should not carry much weight.
1.9.1.3.1.1. Con: While most of Daenerys' visions in the House of Undying are vague, some did present actual events and even foreshadow the future, for example the upcoming Red Wedding.
1.9.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: The vision predicts the Red Wedding with incredible specificity: it predicts a slaughter at a feast, and shows a dead man with a wolf's head. The Freys cut off the head of Robb's direwolf and sewed it onto Robb's neck at the actual Red Wedding.
1.9.2. Con: Daenerys fights the White Walkers with her dragons North of the wall, burning hundreds of them. This event can be interpreted as representing the "Song of Ice and Fire".
1.9.2.1. Pro: There is potential for future events to further reflect a "Song of Ice and Fire": for example, the interplay between the White Walkers' dragon and Daenerys's.
1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.9.4. Con: Rhaegar refers to his son Aegon by saying that he "is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire". This does not necessarily mean that the Prince and the song go together. Rhaegar might see these characteristics as both present in Aegon yet independent of each other. Thus, it is questionable whether the this is a hallmark of the Prince.
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.9.1.3.1.
1.10. Con: The Prince that was Promised could be the 'three headed dragon' rather than Daenerys herself.
1.10.1. Pro: There are multiple parallels between Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys that match the conditions of the prophecy.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Daenerys, Jon, and Tyrion all, at once point, were involved in the death of their loved ones \(Drogo, Ygritte, Shae\) in a similar manner as Azor Ahai had to kill his wife.
1.10.1.2. Pro: Tyrion, Jon, and Daenerys all had their mothers die in childbirth, and were considered outcasts from their families.
1.10.1.2.1. Con: Daenerys was never an outcast from her family; the rest of her family was killed, and she was an outcast from Westeros.
1.10.1.2.1.1. Con: Being an outcast from Westeros meant being an outcast to her family's legacy and her birthright.
1.10.1.3. Pro: Daenerys, Tyron, and Jon could all be considered as princes or princesses at various points.
1.10.1.3.1. Con: Jon is a bastard, and therefore cannot claim hereditary titles.
1.10.1.3.1.1. Con: It is entirely possible that Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark married before his birth.
1.10.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: High Septon Maynard's logs indicate that he annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia and married him to someone else, likely Lyanna.
1.10.1.3.1.2. Con: The series contains examples of bastards being legitimised - for example, Ramsay Bolton - so this is clearly a possibility.
1.10.1.4. Pro: All could be considered as having been \(re\)born in a manner that fulfils the prophecy.
1.10.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.
1.10.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.
1.10.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.10.1.5. Pro: All three are \(potentially\) descendent from the Targaryen line.
1.10.1.5.1. Pro: Assuming that Tyrion is in fact the offspring of Targaryen blood, the three are the last living Targaryens.
1.10.1.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.1.
1.10.2. Pro: In a vision, Daenerys sees a scene that directly links the prophecy of the Prince that was Promised to the 'three headed dragon'.
1.10.2.1. Pro: 'The woman asks him if he will make a song for the child, and he replies that he has a song and that "He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.". He appears to look at Daenerys then, as if seeing her, and then he adds that "There must be one more," and "The dragon has three heads.".'
1.10.2.1.1. Pro: The use of "he" and the apparent reference to Daenerys as the "one more" \(more than the Prince\) suggest that Daenerys is not the Prince.
1.10.2.2. Con: -> See 1.9.1.3.1.
1.10.2.3. Con: The only proponent of the idea that the prophecy of the Prince refers to the three-headed dragon was Rhaegar. He saw his children as these persons, none of whom is Daenerys. And he was wrong multiple times about who the Prince would be.
1.10.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.1.
1.10.2.3.2. Pro: Rhaegar is unlikely to have been correct as two of his children - Rhaenys and Aegon - were murdered as children. Only his third child, Jon Snow, is still alive.
1.10.2.3.3. Con: Arguably, Rhaegar is instead saying that the three heads of the dragon are his son Aegon \(who is still alive in the books\), Daenerys, and someone else.
1.10.2.3.3.1. Pro: When Rhaegar speaks about Aegon being the Prince in Daenerys's vision, he then looks at her and adds: "There must be one more" and that "The dragon has three heads". Rhaegar, thus, could be implying that Daenerys is part of the three-headed dragon as well as part of the Prince.
1.10.2.3.3.1.1. Con: The same section in the book explains about Daenerys that "though whether he was speaking to her or the women in the bed she could not say." Thus, it is unclear whether Rhaegar refers to Daenerys here.
1.10.2.3.3.2. Con: Rhaegar addressing Daenerys directly might be due to the fact that this conversation takes place merely in a vision of Daenerys. There might be no deeper meaning to this.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.10.2.3.
1.10.4. Con: The Prince is fairly clearly referred to as an individual \(singular pronouns like "he" are used\).
1.10.4.1. Con: The grammar used to refer to the Prince is not necessarily indicative. After all, it was also revealed that the prophecy can be read as referring to either a Prince or a Princess.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: Ambiguity with reference to gender is substantially different from ambiguity with respect to the number of people involved in being the Prince.
1.10.4.1.2. Pro: If there has already been one mistake found in the translation and the way the prophecy was changed throughout time, it is conceivable that the singularity of the pronouns may be another mistake.
1.10.4.2. Con: Prophecies are metaphorical, and their wording is not meant to be taken literally.
1.10.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.10.5. Con: The 'three headed dragon' could also refer to the different roles that Daenerys fulfils, or the different aspects of her character. For example the triumvirate could be made up of her role as the mother of dragons, her role as the conquering Khaleesi, and her role as benevolent Queen.
1.10.5.1. Con: Those three roles are typically seen as part of the unifying characteristic of being a "mhysa," or mother. They are not distinct roles.
1.10.5.2. Con: There is no particular reason to believe that Daenerys has only three aspects of her character - one could just as easily cast her as a loving wife, a grieving widow, a vengeful protector.
1.10.6. Pro: Jon Snow and Danaerys could both be the prince who was promised. Azor Ahai could be two persons instead of one.
1.10.7. Con: Daenerys is a 'dragon' \(that's her house\) who had three dragon\(head\)s. Even if you only count the two still live dragons, she herself could act as the third one.
1.10.8. Pro: The requirement that the Prince that was Promised have a song of "Ice and Fire" is more easily fulfilled by an amalgamation of different characters.
1.10.8.1. Con: Ice and fire only require two characters; it would be awkward to have a third one be part of the Prince.

1.10.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.2.
