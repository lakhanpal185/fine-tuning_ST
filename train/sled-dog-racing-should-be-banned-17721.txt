1.3.5. Pro: It is the celebration of Alaskan unity and community, coming together to help those in need, regardless of personal danger.

1.4.7. Pro: This is especially true for smaller, less-regulated races \(the Iditarod is a widely-watched and popular race. The debate is about more than the Iditarod\).
1.4.8. Con: Race organizers investigate instances of dog mistreatment or death to ensure that it doesn't ever happen again.

1.5.6. Pro: Most tourism takes place happens during the summer months; sled dog racing provides an important economic boost during the winter months when tourists would not otherwise visit.
1.5.7. Con: People today would much rather watch the Iditarod in 4K from the comfort of their warm living room in the lower-48.

1.10.2.1. Con: Dogs may be excited to race at first, but become exhausted later.
1.10.2.2. Pro: Dog researchers can understand when dogs are happy and sad by their facial expressions and their body language. We can use this to tell what dogs want to do.
1.10.3. Pro: Using dogs to entertain the public and provide a source of revenue without their ability to consent an equivalent to slavery.
