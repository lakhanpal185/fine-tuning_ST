Discussion Title: Should Trump be impeached?

1. Donald Trump should be impeached.
1.1. Pro: Impeachment is the only way to stop Trump from taking future actions that could be damaging.
1.1.1. Con: The decision of what is "good" or "bad" for the country is made at the election booth. Ethical and moral determinations are made by the electorate. Shifting those functions to an impeachment proceeding nullifies the system of democracy.
1.1.1.1. Con: All aspects of an impeachment proceeding are carried out by the people's elected representatives, so a credible threat of impeachment makes the system more democratic than simply allowing the Executive branch to act for a 4-year period without contemporaneous accountability.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Contemporaneous accountability for moral and ethical policies is made through normal legislation.  Impeachment is intended hold the President accountable for acts of treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors.  Not for policy decisions.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: No specific grounds are required to impeach any president. [Legal opinion](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html) holds that "high crimes and misdemeanors" is expressly political. Congress has the power to impeach a President for political reasons.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This is a political view over a legal view. In order to [file a successful impeachment](http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/100/standards-for-impeachment), a legal clause must be violated, specifically at the federal level, that applies to the President, from "High Crimes to a Misdemeanor" \(which can be as simple as a procedural violation\), a formal charge must be in place. "Not liking" the president is not viable, and claiming hurt feelings or being insulted is also not viable.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Impeachment is a hybrid of legal and political process. Legal because the reasons for the process to be started are written in law, and political because the "judge" is the congress, not a magistrate who studied law and passed the BAR exam.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This is far from established. For example, articles of impeachment against [Andrew Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson) included [noncriminal violations of civil and administrative statutes and political claims such as making speeches with the intent to disrespect Congress](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Impeachment_Johnson.htm#7). Because law enforcement is not a congressional power, [adopting articles of impeachment is seen as a legislative process and not a judicial or administrative process.](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm)
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: [Andrew Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson) was impeached for violating the Tenure act, while other citations were in the articles, this was the only rule violation noted
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: [Each "article" is a co-equal, enumerated charge](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Impeachment_Johnson.htm#7). [The Senate process tried individual articles separately, not the full bill.](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/treasures_of_congress/Images/page_14/48a.html) This clearly implies that any one article could be tried on its own and found to be grounds for removal by a 2/3 vote of the senate.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: In Federalist number 65, Alexander Hamilton explained that impeachment is an inherently political process designed to address "[injuries done immediately to the society itself](http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/fedimpeachment.htm)."
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Alexander Hamilton is citing branches of government in the linked document for handling impeachment. That does not change the fact that a legal precedence is required in order to file articles of impeachment. At no point is the thread talking about or insinuating another branch of government is required. You cant impeach because of a political opinion which means this claim is also incorrectly filed
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Legal scholars appear to agree that indictable offenses [cover far more](https://books.google.com/books?id=_ZSUH83kBt4C&lpg=PA103&ots=5Ur9-Yg668&dq=%E2%80%9CThe%20major%20disagreement%20is%20not%20over%20whether%20impeachable%20offenses%20should%20be%20strictly%20limited%20to%20indictable%20crimes%2C%22&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CThe%20major%20disagreement%20is%20not%20over%20whether%20impeachable%20offenses%20should%20be%20strictly%20limited%20to%20indictable%20crimes%2C%22&f=false) than conduct prohibited by criminal statutes. A president can be impeached for misconduct that is entirely legal.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: "High crimes and misdemeanors" under the British Common Law means an abuse of the power of an office.  It needn't be a criminal violation, but it should bevan abusive use of the power of a Constitutional office.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: The pattern of protecting Flynn, firing Comey, pressuring Sessions not to recuse, publicly attacking the FBI, and seeking assurances of loyalty from Rosenstein easily fits this definition.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.2. Con: The book is not wrong, but the interpretation is. Indictment \(felony level charges\) or misdemeanors is the specific language. An indictment isnt required, but some form of charge is. a misdemeanor level charge is also acceptable.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.3. Pro: Federal Judges have been successfully removed from office for non-criminal acts including [conflicts of interest, intoxication, and abuse of power.](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/impeachments-federal-judges)
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5. Con: A determination of whether the grounds for impeachment exist is [solely in the hands of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_v._United_States), a political branch, and not the judiciary, the legal branch, due to the [Political Question Doctrine](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/political_question_doctrine), effectively making any impeachment political.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: While it is within the power of Congress to determine what is or is not a high crime or misdemeanor, the separation of powers in the US system also relies on norms of behavior that parties should not abuse there prerogatives.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Even if Congress can choose to impeach a President for political reasons, such a precedent would be dangerous.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: The impeachment process removes him from office, it does not convict him of a crime.  A separate criminal trial would have to be held where all the rules of law apply. Without evidence of a crime, he can not be convicted. If he were found innocent, that would lead to significant civil unrest.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: It is certain that any identified felony or criminal act would be pardoned by the incoming president. This statement alone invalidates the claim that the president would be found innocent following an impeachment
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A pardon is not certain, especially if the evidence is weak,  and does not have to be granted before a trial. Trump's personality indicates he would demand his day in court, along with all the media attention it would attract.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: There is a real danger that impeachment occurs and trump is found “innocent”. If that occurs, it could lead to civil unrest. On the other hand, impeachment, removal, conviction, and other punitive steps could also result in civil unrest. This is not a rhetorical question:  How would the outcome impact the decision to proceed or not at the outset?
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: While not technically an impeachment, this was the [logic behind Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon and the alleged Watergate conspirators:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/ford-pardons-nixon-in-1974/2017/07/21/c83efd54-6e3b-11e7-abbc-a53480672286_video.html?utm_term=.37f799b5042b) to "write an end" to an "American tragedy, in which we all have played a part."
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Ford is also on record as a proponent of an essentially political impeachment process: "[What, then, is an impeachable offense? The only honest answer is that an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers to be at a given moment in history; conviction results from whatever offense or offenses two-thirds of the other body \[the Senate\] considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.](http://www.scotusblog.com/2006/12/commentary-gerald-fords-impact-on-the-court/)"
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Allowing Congress to remove a president for political reasons threatens the separation of powers that protects the US from tyranny by any individual branch.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Impeachment would be more dangerous for the stability of the nation: the American legal system is based on the Common Law so devising a system to make him fall would create a dangerous precedent usable in the future to affect presidents who are making right but unpopular choices.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.2.2. Con: Impeachment is the Constitutionally prescribed method by which the legislative branch of government is empowered to check the President. It is the way the system is designed to work.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Legislation is the prescribed method of keeping the Executive political power in check.   Impeachment is an extreme measure intended to be used for the removal of a sitting president for enumerated reasons.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: Broadening the allowable reasons for impeachment to include political views or supported policy would allow Congress to theoretically impeach down the succession list \(vice president, senate president, etc.\) until they reached someone they politically aligned with, which would give congress a great power unchecked by the Executive or Judicial branches.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.4. Pro: Impeaching a President purely for political reasons would cause unnecessary political division in the United States.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.5. Pro: Breaking the taboo of frivolous or excessively political impeachment would likely produce a destructive cycle of partisan retribution that would hurt both sides in the long run.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.5.1. Pro: This arguably has already begun, as every president since [Ronald Reagan has had at least had a hearing held on his impeachment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_investigations_of_United_States_federal_officials#George_H._W._Bush)
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.2.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2. Con: The Political Question Doctrine applies to the [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_question), not the House where impeachment presides. The Supreme Court can lay charges, which the senate can then take up in order to proceed with impeachment but the PQD only applies if it's a topic political in nature. for example,[conduct charges](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/246/297/) against the president or items with the [responsibility of another](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/369/186) branch.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1. Con: The basis for the Court applying the political question doctrine to impeachment is that impeachment is a political matter to be determined solely by Congress. Thus, while the Doctrine only applies to the Court, the basis for its application indicates that impeachment is inherently political rather than legal.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.1. Con: The basis was not on it being a "political matter" but nonjusticiable, as in not the jurisdiction of the supreme court. Issues of this type are handled by the "Senate Judiciary Committee", a legal arm of the senate.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: The impeachment process is not ["handled" by the Senate Judiciary Committee](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/3_1986SenatesImpeachmentRules.pdf). While certain committees in either chamber may make non-binding recommendations, the only actions relevant to an impeachment outcome are [\(1\) the entry of draft articles of impeachment into the hopper, \(2\) a simple majority vote of the House to adopt those articles, then \(3\) a 2/3 majority vote of the Senate to remove the President based on any one article.](https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/98-806.pdf)
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Because the impeachment process is nonjusticiable, no aspect of it can be challenged on legal grounds or reversed by the judiciary. Thus, even if a "defendant" had legitimate reason to feel a duly adopted article of impeachment were unconstitutional or illegal, he/she would have no recourse in the matter. The effect is that the process is solely governed and constrained by congressional politics.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: The PQD is only about [justiciability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justiciability), as in the limits upon legal issues with relation to the law over which a court can exercise its judicial authority. It by no means designates anything political, it just applies as a rule of jurisdictions related between the branches. cases like [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:United_States_political_question_doctrine_case_law) show examples of where it applies \(or not\).
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2.1.2.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.3. Con: Technically Speaking, even the Supreme Court is a [Political Branch](https://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/teacher_lessons/3branches/1.htm) of the US government, which by the WB definition of [political](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/political) means they all are, but [impeachment](https://definitions.uslegal.com/i/impeachment/) is still a law presided over by the senate
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.3.1. Con: Generally, experts [distinguish](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1366&context=faculty_publications) between the political branches \(the executive and legislature\) and the judiciary \(e.g., the Supreme Court\).
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.3.1.1. Con: Based on the included [publication](https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1366&context=faculty_publications), the separation of the three political branches is about jurisdictions of authority. also per the linked publication: "\[s\]carcely any political question arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial question"
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.3.1.1.1. Con: However, due to long-established [nonjusticiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_v._United_States) of impeachment proceedings, impeachment is one of those "scarce" exceptions.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton) was impeached for lying to investigators
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.7. Pro: While Nixon was not successfully impeached, it's believed he would have, where the articles that were drafted cited the Watergate scandal \(DNC headquarters break in\), specifically citing the "obstruction of justice" for Nixon not turning over the tapes as ordered
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.2.
1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.
1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: From the article cited in the above claim,"The Constitution sets specific grounds for impeachment ... To be impeached and removed from office, the House and Senate must find that the official committed one of these acts."
1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: The constitution states “The president, vice-president, and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” Given there is no greater specificity given, misdemeanours can be read as misdeeds or bad behaviour and need not refer to an illegal infraction.
1.1.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.
1.1.1.1.1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.
1.1.1.1.1.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.
1.1.2. Con: No impeachment proceeding has ever successfully removed a president. A failed removal effort in this case would likely backfire politically and/or in terms of Trump's post-impeachment behavior in office.
1.1.3. Pro: The appointment of multiple justices during his term can have an enduring and[irreversible effect](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/30/trump-judge-appointments-roe-v-wade-courts) on the country in the future, even when he doesn't get reelected.
1.1.4. Con: There are multiple ways of preventing a President from taking harmful actions. Significant action requires the approval of Congress. Actions can be challenged in court.  We elect a President, not a King.
1.1.4.1. Con: As the current Congress has a Republican majority, President Trump won't have much difficulty pushing his policies through.
1.1.5. Pro: Trump must be impeached to protect the homeland from the influence of foreign adversaries.
1.1.5.1. Pro: According to the Fusion GPS transcript, Donald Trump has "clear" long-time relationships to Russian organized crime. This poses a significant national security threat that could possibly spill over to diplomatic issues.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Glenn Simpson claims that he went to the FBI with this information because he believed then candidate Donald Trump was at risk of being blackmailed.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: The[Fusion GPS Steele dossier](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html) is more than conjecture and accusations.  There have been more than 31 separate meetings between Russian actors and the Trump campaign with everyone of the meetings having initially been denied.  The dossier mentions a number of meetings\(12+\) that have been confirmed by other sources.  The dossier correctly predicted the privatization of Rosneft\(unknown to CEO\).  And finally, there have been a number of linked FSB and GRU arrests and one murder within Russia.
1.1.5.1.3. Con: This is conjecture and accusation driven by a political campaign supported by the previous Administration in power. Conjecture that causes hysteria and overreaction are threats to our electoral system and should not be indulged.
1.1.5.1.3.1. Con: Many aspects of the dossier have been widely reported [\(since Feb 2017\)](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jasonaleopold/us-intelligence-has-confirmed-parts-of-the-dossier-about-tru?utm_term=.pn6bzPZB7#.vodNbap1y) to have been confirmed by intelligence sources.
1.1.5.2. Con: Trump is advancing US interests and rebuilding the country. His broader political success counteracts any political misdemeanours Trump may be accused of. Impeaching him would put a stop to this good work.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Claim to virtues or accomplishments do not excuse one from obeying the law.  If some action of the President would be grounds for impeachment were he not effective or advancing U.S. interests, it constitutes similarly valid grounds even if he is.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: He has lost the confidence of the public since taking up office.
1.1.5.2.2.1. Con: Removing Presidents based on the shifting whims of public opinion would destabilize our entire government.
1.1.5.2.2.2. Con: There have been less popular presidents who still weren't impeached.
1.1.5.2.2.3. Pro: The latest [Gallup polls](http://news.gallup.com/poll/201617/gallup-daily-trump-job-approval.aspx) show that 60% of American citizens disapprove of Trump's work so far.
1.1.5.2.2.3.1. Con: We've seen how accurate these polls can be based on the election
1.1.5.2.2.4. Pro: [A CNN poll](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/08/politics/cnn-poll-trump-one-year-later/index.html) shows that whereas 81% of Republicans surveyed last year thought Trump could unite the country, this year the figure has dropped to 65%.
1.1.5.2.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.2.3.1.
1.1.5.2.2.5. Pro: The [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/26/worldwide-few-confident-in-trump-or-his-policies/) has published data that shows levels of confidence in Trump are low worldwide.
1.1.5.2.2.6. Pro: American's perception of Trump, 6 months into his presidency, was [historically low](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/six-months-in-trump-is-historically-unpopular/).
1.1.5.2.2.6.1. Con: Trump's approval according to [Rasmussen](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/prez_track_feb09) has risen since his State of the Union speech. His approval is currently higher then Obama's at the same time of his presidency.
1.1.5.2.2.6.1.1. Con: Rasmussen polls trend more conservative than most.  RealClearPolitics averages polls together to be more indicative of a president's approval ratings.  They put Trump's approval/disapproval on Feb. 21st of his second year at [41.9/54.2](http://dyn.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html) \(-12.3\).   At the same point in his presidency, Obama's spread was [47.1/46.0](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html) \(+1.1\).
1.1.5.2.2.6.1.2. Con: Rasmussen uses a combination of landline polling and voluntary online surveys to get their data.  They are routinely an outlier. [rasmussenreports.com](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/about_us/methodology)
1.1.5.2.2.6.1.3. Con: [Other sources](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) that take an aggregate place him lower than anyone other than Carter and Truman .
1.1.5.2.3. Pro: Jobless claims are at a [50 year low](https://www.upi.com/US-jobless-claims-hit-near-50-year-low/1431519923735/).  Tax revenues are yielding revenue surpluses, counter to the claims that his tax cuts would contribute to a larger deficit \(it's actually helping to lower the deficit with surpluses\), [cbo.gov](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53821). The labor force participation rate has stabilized, [data.bls.gov](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000).
1.1.5.2.4. Pro: Unemployment is at an [18 year low.](http://time.com/5298560/us-gains-jobs-unemployment-low/)
1.1.5.2.5. Pro: Trump's shift in strategy has largely seen ISIS's territory [dramatically shrink](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/452868/trumps-isis-victory) since he was in office.
1.1.5.2.5.1. Con: These campaigns were well underway during the [previous administration](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/26/donald-trump/trump-takes-full-credit-gains-against-isis/).The blunder in this case was [forcing the hand](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/us-to-arm-kurds-for-assault-on-raqqa-despite-turkeys-objections/article/2622551) of the Iraq and Turkey government by announcing the formation of a largely Kurdish security force on the Syrian side of the Iraq and Turkish border.
1.1.5.2.5.2. Con: Trump didn't 'shift strategy' - he just abandoned the situation.
1.1.5.2.5.3. Con: The Syrian people are now experiencing an even worse situation as a result of all of these dynamics.
1.1.5.2.5.4. Con: America has lost any ability to steer the situation in any way \(toward our 'interests'\) - either regarding justice or democracy for Syrians, greater geopolitical stability, or US business interests.
1.1.5.2.6. Pro: The US economy is going through an all-time high, [with 70 Dow Records](https://www.bespokepremium.com/think-big-blog/a-record-for-record-highs/).
1.1.5.2.6.1. Con: Trump has not been in office long enough to credibly claim significant positive impact from his leadership.
1.1.5.2.6.1.1. Pro: It is [too early](http://fortune.com/2017/07/20/donald-trump-economy-stock-market-jobs-reports-credit/) to determine whether or not these changes will stick. It's possible the markets reacted to Trump's campaign promises, but may not exhibit continual growth.
1.1.5.2.6.2. Con: Economics, even if one could claim that sustained stock-market price rises indicated economic strength, is but one aspect of a country's wellness.
1.1.5.2.6.2.1. Pro: This is akin to claiming that a dishonest, wife-beating husband who throws trash around and insults all his neighbours is a "keeper" because he runs a thriving business.
1.1.5.2.6.3. Con: DOW is not a reliable measure of US citizens' interest or well-being, it merely reflects the trading value of an elite group of companies.
1.1.5.2.6.3.1. Pro: The DOW is just the trading value of a few top companies, and their high values may have come from things that are bad for Americans. The Dow is high because investors expect this profiteering to increase under Trump.
1.1.5.2.6.3.1.1. Pro: \(e.g., Walmart raids small businesses, CocaCola/McDonald's encourages a nation-wide obesity epidemic, Visa/AmEx levy transaction taxes across the economy, Chevron/Exxon pollute our commons, etc.-vulture capitalism\).
1.1.5.2.6.4. Con: The stock market [fell dramatically](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/us-stocks-powell-fed-trump.html) in March of 2018, a direct result of Trump's economic policies and ongoing scandals.
1.1.5.2.6.5. Pro: GDP has [averaged 2.9%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/188165/annual-gdp-growth-of-the-united-states-since-1990/) under his administration, almost double Obama's 1.5% average.
1.1.5.2.6.6. Con: None of the improvements to the economy are the result of anything that Donald Trump or the Republican Administration have done.
1.1.5.2.6.6.1. Pro: In particular, the [Dow Index](https://www.google.ca/search?q=INDEXDJX:.DJI&tbm=fin#scso=uid_gW9_WrnoEqOE5wLQtpSoBQ_5:0,uid_R3N_Wrv6KcmOsgHLrJTYBw_5:0) and the [S&P 500 Index](https://www.google.ca/search?q=INDEXSP:.INX&tbm=fin#scso=uid_i29_WufOMaLJ5gLZ0IvIBA_5:0,uid_ZnN_Wu__H4T-sQHPoYqADQ_5:0) were already increasing before Trump took office.
1.1.5.2.6.6.1.1. Con: According to the sources given, and applying that same logic, noting the rate of growth and recovery suggests that Bush started the recovery and not Obama.
1.1.5.2.6.6.1.1.1. Con: Noting the rate of growth/recovery, the economy improved more under Obama in any 5 years than under Bush from October 2002-2007 \(between the two recessions\). The difference between the improvement since Trump's inauguration and the improvement in the previous year is not unusual variation for a single year.
1.1.5.2.6.6.1.1.2. Con: Whether or not Obama caused the stock market to improve is irrelevant to the claim that Trump caused the stock market to improve.
1.1.5.2.6.6.1.1.2.1. Con: If one places a ruler on a [DJI chart](https://www.google.com/search?q=dji+chart&rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS787US787&oq=dji&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0j69i59l2j0.3523j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) at the start of Obamas term \(6,627\) to the end \(20,810\), one can see that the rise under Trump to March 5, 2018 is a continuation of the rise under Obama as that rise is almost exactly where it is now \(24,875\).
1.1.5.2.6.6.1.1.2.2. Con: Its relevant in the case of the logic you applied where it pertains to "not giving trump credit". Either Obama's recovery started with Bush and Trump's recovery was due to Obama, or neither is the case.
1.1.5.2.6.6.1.1.3. Con: Unlike the Obama/Trump comparison, the economy was not already improving before Bush left office.
1.1.5.2.6.6.1.1.3.1. Con: Incorrect. The US started a [recovery](https://www.cfr.org/report/quarterly-update-us-economic-recovery-historical-context) late 2007, and have been on the same rate of growth since. This is an issue given the rate of recovery being so slow, tied with additional bureaucratic regulatory controls like [DF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act) , creation of complex [health insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act) bureaucratic rules and the push for the [quantitative easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing) that artificially inflated stocks \(filling the 1%'s bank accounts while ripping off the lower/middle class\)
1.1.5.2.6.6.2. Con: The massive corporate tax cuts will increase share earnings and have already [boosted stock prices.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/dec/19/stock-markets-record-highs-us-tax-reform-vote-business-live)
1.1.5.2.6.7. Pro: Tax restructuring has encouraged [companies](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/tax-reform-reaction-att-is-giving-bonuses-to-200000-employees.html) to re-invest into the US
1.1.5.2.6.8. Con: At the point when Trump made this claim, [the market](http://fortune.com/2017/12/19/justin-wolfers-donald-trump-stock-market-returns/) had risen 17.5% so far in the Trump presidency. It rose 37.5% over the equivalent part of the Obama presidency. It is therefore not a record.
1.1.5.2.6.9. Con: The 1.5 trillion dollar tax cut will lead to massive deficits and debt, leading to automatic spending cuts in medicare and other entitlement programs greatly impacting the medical industry as well as Americans' general well being which will affect worker productivity.
1.1.5.2.6.9.1. Pro: The [2010 PAYGO act](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/29/upshot/paygo-medicare-cuts-tax-bill.html) mandates automatic cuts to programs such as Medicare in the case of rising debt, created by the tax cuts.
1.1.5.2.6.9.2. Pro: The Congressional Budget Office [estimated that](http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/27/politics/cbo-score-senate-tax/index.html) the Nov 27 version of the bill would add 1.44 trillion to the debt over 10 years, assuming some growth from the tax cuts. 
Later versions to secure votes would add additional tax breaks.
1.1.5.2.7. Pro: Trump's recent tweets countering North Korea's Leader seem to have made him settle down and open up [communications](http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/03/asia/north-korea-south-hotline/index.html) to South Korea. This may be attributed to Trump's "no nonsense" attitude to North Korea and China.
1.1.5.2.7.1. Con: This appears to be conjecture.
1.1.5.2.7.1.1. Con: Using the word "seem" implies cautious uncertainty in the author's opinion.  The forthcoming meetings following Trump's series of actions are observable data, and enough to formulate an opinion about.
1.1.5.2.8. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.2.6.
1.1.5.2.9. Con: The presidency should be held by someone who is a moral and intellectual example to the rest of the nation, which Trump is not.
1.1.5.2.9.1. Con: Trump's morals and intellect were known prior to the election.  The electorate judged him worthy of the position.
1.1.5.2.9.2. Pro: Trump has made racist and derogatory comments about other nations.
1.1.5.2.9.2.1. Con: The above claim conflates Race and Nationality. Disparaging a country and its citizens is not the same as disparaging a race.
1.1.5.2.9.2.1.1. Con: Derogatory generalizations about any class of people are both false and immoral. They are products of amorality and a weak intellect, unfit for the high office of President.
1.1.5.2.9.2.2. Pro: Trump is blatantly alienating our allies and befriending our "enemies"- i.e. dictators who stand against everything our country stands FOR. This is weakening our country, our safety and the world order for democracy.
1.1.5.2.9.3. Con: The U.S. public has often lauded a ["Superhero President"](https://www.geopolitica.ru/en/article/superhuman-american-national-myth), which would encompass all virtues of the American public. Unfortunately this superhuman is not real, [and few presidents have held close to this ideal.](http://all-that-is-interesting.com/shocking-presidential-quotes)
1.1.5.2.9.4. Con: The Constitution clearly lays out who is allowed  to run for president. There is no "should be" such and such requirement.
1.1.5.2.9.5. Pro: Trump is a [creator](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/us/politics/trump-divisiveness.html) of divisive political drama.  His actions and tweets in his first year have created enough division already, impeachment would relieve this political stress.
1.1.5.2.9.5.1. Pro: [Many families](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/donald-trump-election-hillary-clinton-half-my-family-torn-apart-hatred-animosity-between-racism-a7424651.html) have fallen out over the divisiveness of the recent US election. Bringing an end to this administration would enable families to come back together again.
1.1.5.2.9.5.2. Pro: Trump is at the centre of the [divisive Kaepernick controversy](http://www.courant.com/sports/hc-jacobs-column-trump-sports-0926-20170925-column.html) in football and sport in general.
1.1.5.2.9.5.3. Pro: Trump refused to call out the divisive white supremacists rally in [Charlottesville](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/08/13/us/charlottesville-heather-heyer-profile/index.html), which resulted in the death of Heather Heyer.
1.1.5.2.9.5.4. Pro: [A poll](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/24/trump-polls-division-unity-243063) shows that a majority of Americans find Trump to be a divisive figure.
1.1.5.2.9.5.5. Con: This is just an opinion or a "who started it" argument. Based on the history of the division here in the US, the articles are selective in filtering out that Trump came in with the most divided country in history. Even [PEW](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/07/americas-political-divisions-in-5-charts/) covered the division with a "unknown if trump can fix it"
1.1.5.2.9.5.6. Con: Trump is not the cause of such division. The unfair and biased liberal monopoly on the media has caused this division.
1.1.5.2.9.5.6.1. Pro: Trump had received [3 times](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/12/26/17-striking-findings-from-2017/) more negative media coverage than Obama in his first 60 days, with only 5% positive coverage.
1.1.5.2.9.5.6.2. Pro: Organizations such as the [Media Research Center](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/rich-noyes/2018/05/08/media-get-trumped-presidents-polls-improve-despite-90-negative) have found that the media's coverage of Trump was just as severely biased and negative in 2018 as it was in 2017.
1.1.5.2.9.5.7. Con: Divisive political drama has always existed, and this current trend started a decade ago with the advent of social media.
1.1.5.2.9.5.7.1. Pro: Social media creates echo chambers, whereby people only encounter material that supports their view and are never challenged by arguments against them.
1.1.5.2.9.5.7.2. Con: [A study](http://pablobarbera.com/static/barbera_polarization_APSA.pdf) showed that social media actually reduces mass political polarisation, by exposing people to messages from more distant individuals, which are more likely to provide novel information.
1.1.5.2.9.5.8. Con: [Polarization has been increasing for many years](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/7-things-to-know-about-polarization-in-america/).  This is a trend that began long before President Trump took office and polarization has increased over many past presidents.  Impeachment of Trump would not resolve this trend because he is not the cause of it.
1.1.5.2.9.6. Pro: The Office Of President of the United States is one that the people of other nations look to in order to understand the attitudes and direction that the government and people of the United States are embracing, so by upsetting the global perception Trump is affecting how US citizens are perceived.
1.1.5.2.9.6.1. Pro: Impeaching Donald Trump communicates to the public, the world, and future presidents, that the actions he has taken thus far are unacceptable for the post.
1.1.5.2.9.6.1.1. Pro: Monkey see monkey do. If a president is allowed to behave any way not acceptable legally his [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_affairs_of_Donald_Trump) poisons the presidency for the future.
1.1.5.2.9.6.2. Con: All over the world, countries put themselves first when considering immigration applications, international trade, defense, global welfare, world policing, etc. The US is not the first or most nationalistic country in the world.
1.1.5.2.9.6.2.1. Con: Part of putting one's self or one's nation first is doing right by others in order to gather friends and allies on whom you can count to come to your assistance in times of need and not to try to steal from or take advantage of you when times are good.
1.1.5.2.9.7. Pro: Trump has been accused of sexual harassment and has been recorded describing lewd behaviour towards women.
1.1.5.2.9.7.1. Pro: Trump admitted to sexual harassment [on tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape), and confirmed the tape is real.
1.1.5.2.9.7.1.1. Pro: He is heard saying: "I'm automatically attracted to beautiful \[women\]—I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything."
1.1.5.2.9.7.1.2. Con: Talking about it is not actually doing it
1.1.5.2.9.7.1.2.1. Con: The claim was that Trump admitted to doing it, not that he did it by means of talking about doing it.
1.1.5.2.9.7.2. Pro: That he is president yet hasn’t been cleared of multiple sexual offence allegations sends a message that sexual abuse is not a serious issue, that powerful men will escape accountability and that it’s not worth coming forward about abuse.
1.1.5.2.9.7.2.1. Con: The crimes he is accused of took place prior to the Presidency and came out before he was even elected or sworn in. As such, they cannot form the basis of a Presidential impeachment.
1.1.5.2.9.7.2.2. Con: Allegations are not a serious issue. Allegations do not require any sort of judicial review or supporting evidence. Anyone can make any allegation towards any person at any time. No citizen of the United States is guilty of a crime until they have been given the due process of law.
1.1.5.2.9.7.2.3. Con: He hasn't been charged with any sexual offences
1.1.5.2.9.7.3. Pro: Trump's [feud](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/12/politics/trump-gillibrand-feud-layers/) over Senator Gillibrand's call for him to resign is adding pressure to the GOP to act on previous allegations.
1.1.5.2.9.7.3.1. Con: Senator Gillibrand calls for resignation based on uninvestigated, unsubstantiated  accusations, thus unconstitutionally, bypassing due process.
1.1.5.2.9.7.3.2. Pro: Over 100 members of Congress are calling for an [investigation](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/12/16766800/democratic-congress-members-trump-investigation-women) into the allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump.
1.1.5.2.9.7.3.2.1. Con: This is not the jurisdiction of the Oversight Committee. It's just a political maneuver to stir the pot. The Oversight Committee is for government spending, taxation and things that happen while in office. Cases like Bill Clinton's activities while in AK were ruled out of jurisdiction during the whole Lewinsky incident as an example.
1.1.5.2.9.7.3.3. Con: Based on Senator Gillibrands statements, she should resign immediately due to making defamatory remarks and stated unproven allegations as fact.
1.1.5.2.9.7.4. Con: Trump has accusations against him but he has not admitted to sexual harassment.
1.1.5.2.9.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.9.7.1.
1.1.5.2.9.7.4.2. Pro: What Trump admitted to in the Access Hollywood Tape is not sexual harassment. Sexual harassment must involve a quid pro quo or a hostile work environment. The revelation of these discussions was embarrassing to candidate Trump but it is not sexual harassment and it is not a crime.
1.1.5.2.9.7.4.2.1. Con: If we assume that Trump committed these actions in New York, they are a crime.  New York state law would define "grabbing a woman by the p*ssy" as [forcible touching](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-130-52.html), a class A misdemeanour.  If Trump makes a habit of this behavior, it could be [persistent sexual abuse](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-130-53.html), a Class E felony.  It is likely that other states also criminalize this sort of behavior.
1.1.5.2.9.7.5. Con: He has not been convicted in the court of law of anything having to do with sexual harassment.
1.1.5.2.9.7.6. Con: This is not an impeachable offense. One need only go back as far as Bill Clinton to acknowledge this. His attempted \(and failed\) impeachment over the Monica Lewinsky scandal was because he lied, not because he actually had an inappropriate relationship.
1.1.5.2.9.7.6.1. Con: Having an affair is not akin to sexual harassment and abuse. They are two very different things.
1.1.5.2.9.7.7. Pro: Donald Trump [admitted in 2005](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2016/oct/18/allegations-about-donald-trump-and-miss-teen-usa-c/) to walking into women's changing rooms before pageants, bragging about how he can "get away with things like that". This was verified by former contestants. It is not a crime to do this, but it is not moral character fitting of a president.
1.1.5.2.9.7.7.1. Con: Men in the changing rooms is "common place" in the fashion and modeling world
1.1.5.2.9.7.7.1.1. Con: Being commonplace does not make it right.
1.1.5.2.9.7.7.1.1.1. Con: Being commonplace, even while the view or positioning of the action is being deemed "perverted" without evidence, and taking into account we have people suing schools to allow boys in the girls changing/bath rooms, does not make it illegal, wrong or unethical.
1.1.5.2.9.7.8. Pro: Trump is [accused of sexual assault by 19 different woman.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/what-about-the-19-women-who-accused-trump/547724/)
1.1.5.2.9.7.8.1. Con: Accusations do not constitute either high crimes or misdemeanors
1.1.5.2.9.7.8.2. Con: Because all of these incidents occurred before Trump was elected, they are not grounds for impeachment
1.1.5.2.9.7.8.2.1. Con: Partially true. While the constitution has no condition related to it, in some states, being convicted of a crime blocks you from being on the ballot. It is a far reach, as it would require actual felony charges to be applied for it to happen though.
1.1.5.2.9.7.9. Con: Harassment of an individual must be [continual](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/harassment). If it is not alleged by the individuals that Trump's unwanted advances were continual over multiple instances, the allegations cannot be considered harassment by definition.
1.1.5.2.9.7.9.1. Con: When a person engages in serial activity to harass multiple individuals, thus establishing a pattern of harassing behavior, it does not matter if each victim is distinct or if the behavior is repeated and impacts an individual victim multiple times. Harassment can be applied as a label to the perpetrator of patterned behavior, even when the perpetrator victimizes each person a single time.
1.1.5.2.9.7.9.2. Con: A [single, egregious act](https://www.tlnt.com/court-finds-it-only-takes-one-incident-to-have-a-hostile-work-environment/) can suffice to establish harassment.
1.1.5.2.9.7.9.2.1. Con: Technically that court decision said the single act “rendered the workplace hostile”, not strictly that the offending behavior was “harassment,” although the case was categorized under the broad phrase “sexual harassment”
1.1.5.2.9.8. Pro: He demonstrates little to no acceptance of the basic values the US is founded on, such as freedom of speech \(the free press\), freedom of religion, and immigration. Values who happen to be consistant with global human rights values, and thus he is not fit to lead the worlds most powerful country.
1.1.5.2.10. Con: How well someone is doing as president should not preclude them from facing justice for legal crimes.
1.1.5.2.10.1. Con: There are no grounds to impeach the president as he has not committed a violation of a federal law.
1.1.5.2.10.1.1. Pro: Thus far, all claims that would qualify for impeachment have not been proven. Even the majority of democrats agree based on [this vote](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/12/house-impeachment-vote-goes-down-big.html).
1.1.5.2.10.1.1.1. Pro: Unless there is undeniable proof, a wild call for impeachment will not fly.
1.1.5.2.10.1.1.2. Con: No grounds have been proven false; they simply haven't been proven true yet. Time will tell.
1.1.5.2.10.1.1.2.1. Con: This logic applies the "guilty until proven innocent" reasoning. In the US we require a conviction to lay this kind of claim.
1.1.5.2.10.1.1.2.2. Con: It is impossible to prove something does not exist.  [Forcing a political opponent to try is a common political tactic.](http://blog.dilbert.com/2018/01/20/make-opponents-try-fail-prove-negative/)
1.1.5.2.10.1.1.3. Con: Trump has [refused to acknowledge](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-denies-he-denied-russian-medd/) that the United States has been attacked and [has refused to take steps](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-is-ignoring-the-worst-attack-on-america-since-911/2018/02/18/5ad888f2-14f3-11e8-8b08-027a6ccb38eb_story.html?utm_term=.a4f00ad88e68) to protect the country from future attacks.  This violates his [oath of office](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Oath_of_office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States) and is an ideal qualification for his impeachment
1.1.5.2.10.1.1.4. Con: Articles of impeachment presented by the minority party are manifestly DOA and therefore not taken seriously.
1.1.5.2.10.1.1.5. Con: All individual claims for Impeachment have been declined by Congress to pursue.  So hearings or judgments will not be proceed until formal accusations have been proffered. No Impeachment is underway period.
1.1.5.2.10.1.2. Pro: Impeachment at this point is premature without sufficent evidence and would trivialize the significance of the impeachment process.
1.1.5.2.10.1.3. Con: Trump's team is guilty of bribery.
1.1.5.2.10.1.3.1. Pro: Trump's personal lawyer [has received](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44215656) hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for a diplomatic meeting with the Ukrainian president.
1.1.5.2.10.1.3.2. Pro: Trump likely took a [bribe from China](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/opinion/trump-china-bribe-national-security.html). After banning sales of the phone on military bases on the grounds that China was using them for espionage, Trump turned around and said that he was working with President Xi of China to help save ZTE — “Too many jobs in China lost.” This occurred after a Chinese owned company invested a large sum of money in a project in which the Trump Organization has a substantial stake.
1.1.5.2.10.1.3.3. Con: Trump has not been convicted of bribery.
1.1.5.2.10.1.4. Con: Trump is guilty of [violating campaign finance law](https://www.newsweek.com/michael-cohen-says-donald-trump-directed-him-violate-campaign-finance-laws-1084213).
1.1.5.2.10.1.5. Pro: If a blatantly impeachable offense is uncovered it is likely Congress would act.
1.1.5.2.10.1.5.1. Con: The likelihood of Congress acting against their own party is not supported by historical evidence.
1.1.5.2.10.1.5.1.1. Pro: The last three presidential impeachment proceedings, against Andrew Johnson in 1867, Richard Nixon in 1973, and Bill Clinton in 1998, only took place while their opposing party held both chambers of Congress. In fact, the [majority of impeachments overall](https://www.infoplease.com/history-and-government/us-government/impeachments-federal-officials) have only been initiated by members of an opposing party.
1.1.5.2.10.1.5.2. Pro: One would think they would have to, in order to keep the public from possibly revolting.
1.1.5.2.10.1.5.3. Con: Representative Devin Nunes has been [recorded](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/9/17670930/devin-nunes-tape) claiming his goal is to keep Trump in office whatever the circumstances rather than see justice upheld.
1.1.5.2.10.1.5.4. Con: The current administration can and would insist to everyone who would listen that the "blatantly impeachable" offence either does not exist or is not impeachable, if they believe that doing so would serve the party.
1.1.5.2.10.1.5.5. Con: Republican partisan loyalty could preclude impeachment regardless of how egregious or blatant the offenses are.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6. Con: President Trump’s personal and business holdings present untenable conflicts of interest
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.1. Pro: By using taxpayer money to provide accommodations for his staff and secret service for his frequent visits to his own resorts he is funneling taxpayer money directly into his family’s business. The taxpayers should be demanding his removal for this alone. [slate.com](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/09/documents_show_national_security_council_spent_taxpayer_money_at_trump_s.html)
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.1.1. Pro: Housing facilities have been established for the office of the president, yet Trump chooses to force the Secret Service to [lease](http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-secret-service-maralago-new-years-eve-costs-783831) his [properties](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/08/04/trump-tower-evicts-secret-service-over-rental-dispute.html) for profit, which is akin to profiteering off of the office of the President.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.2. Pro: [It is increasingly clear](http://time.com/5109253/trump-organization-money-laundering-russians-russia/) that the President, [by refusing to fully divest himself from his business](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/11/news/trump-conflicts-press-conference/index.html), is either directing or willfully ignoring [massive amounts of money laundering](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-schiff/trump-organization-money-laundering-alleged-in-fusion-gps-testimony-house-democrat-idUSKBN1F739D) going on [through the acquisition and sale of real estate](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article152934589.html) by his direct business reports. Money laundering is a federal crime.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.3. Con: [The FEC](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2838696-Trump-2016-Financial-Disclosure.html) has evaluated Trump's supposed conflicts of interest and deemed it not an issue.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.3.1. Pro: Based on filing disclosures and a Trust, the president has cleared the Ethics Committee's requirements to avoid the [Emoluments clause](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-retains-assets-worth-at-least-14-billion-new-disclosure-shows/2017/06/16/c0bc4caa-52b9-11e7-be25-3a519335381c_story.html?utm_term=.3a3319df6018)
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.4. Pro: Trump has [the means](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-blackmail-bribe-foreign-government-philippines-japan-taiwan-turkey-argentina-a7473811.html) to receive an anonymous bribe through his companies.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.10.1.3.2.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.5. Con: Conflicts of interest are gross and should be handled, but they are not [grounds for impeachment](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html)
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.3.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.6. Pro: The [Presidential Compensation Clause](https://impeachdonaldtrumpnow.org/resources/faqs/#grounds-for-impeachment) prohibits serving US Presidents from receiving emoluments outside of their Presidential compensation, as a way of preventing corruption. Trump's domestic businesses violate this clause.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.6.1. Con: It refers to any payment derivative from his direct actions as president, not from payments received from business made outside of his presidency. We can clearly note that this claim has no historical background.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.6.2. Pro: Trump continues to own businesses that receive government [subsidies and tax breaks](https://impeachdonaldtrumpnow.org/resources/faqs/#grounds-for-impeachment). It is in his interest, therefore, to keep this in place regardless of what that means for the country at large. This is corruption.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.7. Pro: Trump has [conflicts of interest](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/tracking-trumps-web-of-conflicts/#foreign_properties) based on his private holdings, several of which violate the U.S. Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause, which alone, is grounds for impeachment.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.7.1. Con: [Conflicts of interest](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_7.1), once disclosed or contracted handling is absolved are no longer within the conflicts of interest category for charges.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.7.2. Pro: For instance, by Trump's own admission, his business investments in Istanbul pose a [conflict of interest](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/tracking-trumps-web-of-conflicts/#foreign_properties) when dealing with Turkey politically.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.7.2.1. Con: Once disclosed and contracted control distributed, this is no longer applicable. [The law](https://www.oge.gov/Web/OGE.nsf/Resources/18+U.S.C.+%C2%A7+208:+Acts+affecting+a+personal+financial+interest) also exempts a large portion of potential conflicts of interest from being applied to the president/ vice president. [Even politifact covered this when Giuliana made the claim](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/16/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-president-trump-will-be-exempt-conflict-i/)
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.7.3. Pro: The Commercial Bank of China \(CBC\) is a[major lender to Trump](https://www.vox.com/2016/12/9/13799904/trump-corruption-conflict-of-interest) and the primary tenant in Trump Tower. This obviously conflicts with Trump's ability to separate his personal interests from those of the country when dealing with issues involving the CBC.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.8. Con: The US has never had a President who was a businessman like Trump. This would prevent anyone with businesses or private holdings domestically and abroad from becoming President.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.8.1. Con: [Jimmy Carter](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=4pF9x-cDGsoC&dat=19770104&printsec=frontpage&hl=en) turned his peanut farm and warehouse over to a blind trust when he became president, so people with assets or businesses have become president without contravening ethics rules.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.8.1.1. Con: Trump has also turned his business\(es\) over to a combination of his family and blind trusts. If you take Jimmy Carter's word for it, you cannot say you disbelieve Trump without cause.  Hillary Clinton also promised not to allow her Foundation to interfere, but she continued to accept very large donations from foreign leaders at times coinciding with key decisions affecting those leaders. Uranium One is under investigation.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.8.2. Con: [Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/trumps-conflict-of-interest-problem) all placed their assets in blind trusts while serving as President.
1.1.5.2.10.1.6.9. Pro: Trump has [reportedly](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40639370) booked people, including foreign dignitariesl into his Trump hotels and Mar-a-Lago resort for Presidential events.
1.1.5.2.10.1.7. Con: There are multiple reps raising the motion to impeach based on Trump [violating regulations](http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/15/politics/cohen-articles-of-impeachment/index.html).
1.1.5.2.10.1.7.1. Con: Without evidence to process these claims, this is a procedural motion with no hope of passing given no charges filed. This means, as a procedural motion, it is political
1.1.5.2.10.1.7.2. Con: The political nature of the claims inherently implies organized efforts to impeach. Therefore, multiple sources of motions to impeach aren’t proof of independent action, to the contrary, they bolster the statement regarding the political nature of the attacks.
1.1.5.2.10.1.7.3. Con: The violations have yet to be proven and as such are unproven allegations.
1.1.5.2.10.1.7.4. Con: The proposal for impeachment was denied by both parties under the grounds of unfounded.
1.1.5.2.10.1.8. Pro: In recent history there have been [2 criteria](http://www.dividist.com/2017/06/what-it-takes-to-impeach-president-and.html) that led to the threat of impeachment of a US president: a co-conspirator and corroborating physical evidence. Given neither has been found of Trump, it is too early to call for impeachment.
1.1.5.2.10.1.8.1. Con: We shouldn’t have to be constrained by precedent to decide what constitutes an impeachable offense at the best of times, and even less so when the President’s actions and potential conflicts of interest have no precedent either.
1.1.5.2.10.1.8.1.1. Pro: [No Presidential impeachment case has ever been successfully prosecuted.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment#History_of_federal_impeachment_proceedings_in_the_United_States) The furthest congress has ever gone is adopting articles of impeachment twice. Thus, it is impossible to say that there is any legal precedent aside from past judicial impeachments and examples from England.
1.1.5.2.10.1.8.2. Pro: Clinton has a co-conspirator in Monica Lewinsky and had corroborating physical evidence to prove his crimes.
1.1.5.2.10.1.8.2.1. Con: Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury by a hostile Congress.  Oral sex and adultery are not crimes nor do they qualify as conspiracies.
1.1.5.2.10.1.8.3. Con: [The articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton](https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-resolution/611/text), which are the only articles of impeachment adopted in recent history, cite perjury to a grand jury and making false statements to a federal investigator. The alleged impeachable actions were Bill Clinton's alone, so there could be no "co-conspirator."
1.1.5.2.10.1.8.4. Con: The only other articles of impeachment ever adopted were against Andrew Johnson and [related to public actions Johnson took that displeased Congress.](https://www.nps.gov/anjo/learn/historyculture/the-articles-of-impeachment.htm)
1.1.5.2.10.1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10. Con: Trump has tried to take actions that are [unconstitutional](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ivan-eland/trumps-ban-on-muslims-is_b_8804284.html). For this, he should be impeached.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.1. Con: The constition is a living document and therefore subject to interpretation and change. Judging whether an action is constitutional or not is the responsibility of the supreme court,  not congress where an appeal for impeachment would be initiated.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.2. Con: Not only is that the legislative process, which is not unconstitutional, the bills were not unconstitutional. If you read through the Judge actions around the TRO, they held a Temporary order based on requests or opinions, not based on a legal matter. The closest to having a legal matter was the first version of the ban, which Trump himself retracted when issues were discussed.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.3. Pro: Trump's [actions](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aclu-donald-trump-constitution_us_57878e2be4b08608d3331493) have [repeatedly](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/2016-donald-trump-constitution-guide-unconstitutional-freedom-liberty-khan-214139) [been](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/donald-trump-one-man-constitutional-crisis) [found](http://thehill.com/homenews/media/367911-publisher-trump-effort-to-stop-book-flagrantly-unconstitutional) to [violate](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/25/politics/4th-circuit-travel-ban/index.html) the [U.S. Constitution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/11/21/federal-court-rules-that-trumps-executive-order-targeting-sanctuary-cities-is-unconstitutional/) by [numerous federal courts](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-court-of-appeals.html), and he has generally shown a disregard for the [rule of law](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2017/08/25/trumps-pardon-of-sheriff-arpaio-could-spark-a-constitutional-crisis/#1f558699351e).
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.3.1. Con: None of the links show a disregard for the law. It seems in each case we've seen procedural blocking \(suspension based on feelings\) and not legal blocking \(citing a law that was violated\). Even the SC ruling to block the travel ban was "[based on previous comments](http://thefederalist.com/2017/03/16/5-problems-with-hawaii-judges-halting-trumps-travel-ban/)", not the law itself.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.3.1.1. Con: Courts [routinely look to context](https://books.google.com/books?id=1DxEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA717&lpg=PA717&dq=ways+to+show+impermissible+motivation+constitutional+law&source=bl&ots=mhXRqdW-oB&sig=RG4bpWm2BQjA6660RYvK61QXsJg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwin_OHg6MvYAhUI0WMKHR-IC2wQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&q=ways%20to%20show%20impermissible%20motivation%20constitutional%20law&f=false) surrounding government actions, as the motivation for the action is relevant to its constitutionality.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.3.1.1.1. Con: Example of "Feelings" as per the previous post. and per the [court's](http://documents.latimes.com/read-hawaii-judges-order-blocking-trumps-new-travel-ban/) notes. specfically, the newest TRO \(recently overturned\) was passed based on the grounds of "Trump has never renounced or repudiated his calls for a ban on Muslim immigration.". This is nothing but an opinion for the grounds to issue a TRO rather than citing an actual issue with the EO
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.3.1.2. Con: "Procedural blocking" is not a legal doctrine.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.3.1.2.1. Con: Yes, it is, and the [procedural blocking](http://documents.latimes.com/read-hawaii-judges-order-blocking-trumps-new-travel-ban/) was on the grounds of "feelings", which, as a matter of fact, have been overturned
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.3.1.3. Con: All of the cited cases ruled against Trump on the basis that his actions were likely in violation of the Constitution.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.3.1.3.1. Con: Based on [feelings](http://documents.latimes.com/read-hawaii-judges-order-blocking-trumps-new-travel-ban/), not a citation of a specific law. Procedural blocking as well, which as a matter of point have been overturned.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.4. Con: Trying to pass unconstitutional bills isn't illegal.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.4.1. Pro: While true, the bills were not unconstitutional either
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.4.2. Con: It is a sign of his unfitness for office.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.5. Pro: The Muslim Ban, for instance, was seen by many as unconstitutional.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.5.1. Con: The term "Muslim Ban" is incorrect and used by the political left to vilify the president.  He placed a ban on all travel to and from several countries.  Despite the President's personal views towards the religion, there is nothing in his executive order that targets Muslims.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.5.2. Con: The Supreme Court which is the highest court in the nation has [upheld the ban](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court.html) temporarily until they can come to a conclusion.  This in and of itself suggests the President has a strong case for the executive order to be upheld.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.5.3. Con: The Muslim "Ban" is a temporary halt on Islamic immigration and [Section 1182](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182) of The Constitution gives him the power to do such.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.5.4. Pro: A Federal District Court and two Federal Appeals Courts have ruled that [the ban is illegal](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-court-of-appeals.html), one of which was on the basis that it broke the First Amendment’s prohibition of government establishment of religion.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.5.4.1. Con: The federal court did not rule it was illegal. they ruled in favor of a TRO \(Temporary Restraining Order\), based on a stay/hold of implementation pending review over comments and requests. In addition, the TRO expired and the ban was allowed to progress for this reason.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.5.5. Con: Issuing executive orders that are found to be unconstitutional is not a crime.
1.1.5.2.10.1.10.5.5.1. Pro: [FDR, Bill Clinton, and Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_\(United_States\)) have all issued executive orders that were subsequently overturned. While enforcing an overturned EO is certainly legally dubious, issuing executive orders is well within the President's purview.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11. Con: It is likely that Trump and his administration colluded with Russia.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.1. Con: The only politically valid reason to impeach President Trump would be if he is found to have colluded with Russia to influence the election. But you can only impeach a President for acts committed while in office, so this wouldn't be a constitutionally valid reason
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.2. Pro: Trump's administration has been caught in several iterations of lies about meetings with Russian agents, first saying they never happened, then that they were about adoption, and later that they were about "getting dirt" on Clinton. [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/us/politics/trump-tower-meeting-donald-jr.html)
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.3. Con: Evidence has emerged that the FBI \(McCabe, Strzok, Page, etc\) conspired with British intelligence to frame Trump for Russia collusion. Mr. Trump has called for declassification of documents that prove this, but the DOJ is deliberately delaying the release of the documents under the false claim that doing so would reveal intelligence sources and methods.[Russia Hoax](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062872753/the-russia-hoax/)
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.4. Pro: It is unlikely that Trump would allow his [staff members](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a53134/trump-administration-russia-ties/) to [conspire](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/a-timeline-of-the-trump-russia-scandal-w511067) with [Russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-30/trump-s-ex-campaign-chairman-manafort-told-to-surrender-to-u-s) without his consent.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.4.1. Con: That Trump would now allow his staff to conspire does not necessarily mean that the Trump campaign actually did conspire with the Russians.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.4.2. Pro: [Trump tweeted](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/12/02/trump-faces-watergate-era-question-what-did-he-know-when-did-he-know-it/915482001/) suggesting he knew Flynn lied to FBI when he fired him.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5. Pro: The Russia Special Counsel Investigation would not have been commissioned and carried through if there was nothing untoward to be suspicious of.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.1. Pro: The body of lies, exaggerations, and misleading statements by Trump, which is enormous and well-documented \(for examples, [wapo.st](http://wapo.st/2BSWxdv)\) naturally leads one to the conclusion that attempts to obstruct justice \(an impeachable crime\) are VERY likely.  The lack of concrete evidence at this moment in time is a consequence of Mueller's need to proceed quietly until such time as he deems the evidence either insufficient, or sufficient, to prosecute with.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.2. Pro: [Several members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Counsel_investigation_\(2017%E2%80%93present\)) of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted as a result of the investigation, which suggests there was more than mere media frenzy to spark the investigation.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.2.1. Con: The indictments were not related to the campaign or collusion with Russia
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.2.1.1. Con: The [indictment of George Papadopoulos](https://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download) directly relates to knowing attempted coordination between parts of the campaign and Kremlin operatives.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.3. Pro: The previous head of the FBI, Comey, was [dismissed by Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismissal_of_James_Comey#Comey_memos) upon failing to drop enquiries into National Security Advisor Flynn, who later pleaded guilty of lying to the FBI about his links to Russia.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.3.1. Con: Speculation as to the reason, even though the [Democrats](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/the-conversation/sd-before-trump-fired-fbi-director-james-comey-democrats-wanted-his-dismissal-20170510-story.html) were calling for his dismissal as well before he was actually dismissed.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.3.1.1. Con: The Democrats who wanted James Comey dismissed wanted it solely because of how he handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton. If Trump had wanted to fire Comey for the same reason, he would not have waited six months to do it. Regardless of Trump's reasons, his decision had nothing to do with the Democrats' opposition to Comey.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Trump once [praised James Comey](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/trump-democrats-change-position-on-comey/index.html) for his handling of the Clinton email case.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Trump criticized [Comey](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/12/factchecking-trumps-criticism-fbi/) and highliged several things he felt were done wrong
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.3.1.1.2. Con: Given the nature of investigations, the news media's opinions and what is public, it is understandable that it took 6 months for Trump to get enough information to make the decision
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.3.2. Con: Incidents like Comey's mishandling of the  [Clinton e-mail scandal](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/363194-former-fbi-agent-changed-comeys-language-of-clinton-email-use-to), amongst [other shortcomings](https://texasscribbler.com/2017/05/12/comeys-failures/) were more than likely justification for the decision to fire him as they became known.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.3.2.1. Con: Trump has admitted that [Comey's handling](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/03/giuliani-trump-fired-comey-because-he-wouldnt-tell-him-he-wasnt-a-target.html) of the investigation into Flynn and the whole [Russia conspiracy](https://themoscowproject.org/collusion/trump-cites-russia-investigation-motive-firing-comey/) was foremost on [his mind](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/politics/trump-comey-russia-investigation/index.html) when he fired him.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.5.4. Con: The investigation was created out of conspiracy theories that were constructed through political organizations \([DNC Emails](https://nypost.com/2017/10/26/how-team-hillary-played-the-press-for-fools-on-russia/)\), essentially creating a conflict of interest for self investigation and a political catch 22 which only had the option to allow a special counsel.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.6. Pro: Michael Flynn, Trump's National Security Adviser, [pleaded guilty](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/michael-flynn-guilty-russia-investigation.html) to lying to the F.B.I..
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.6.1. Con: The subject of Flynn's lies - interfering with foreign diplomacy - [hasn't been cause for prosecution since the creation of the Logan Act in 1799](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html?utm_term=.7d865f68ffce)
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.6.1.1. Con: Just because a law hasn't needed to be enforced, does not mean that it can be ignored.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.6.1.2. Con: Michael Flynn was not being investigated for Logan Act violations, but for collusion with a hostile foreign power.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.6.2. Con: Trump fired Flynn [for lying to Pence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-021417/).Unless there is evidence that Trump instructed Flynn to lie to the FBI, Trump is not responsible for the crime.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.7. Con: There is no definitive evidence to suggest the Trump campaign colluded. The investigations have moved on to investigate whether there was obstruction of justice - which implies that they aren't going to find collusion evidence.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.7.1. Con: Based on business ties the president has motive to collude, which despite evidence is enough to compromise his motives. In addition, not 'finding' evidence does not prove it never existed, only that we could not present it to the satisfaction of a court. The investigation seeks to prove beyond doubt, not present any and all discovered controversial materials.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.7.2. Pro: The investigation has persisted for a very long time with no announcement of definitive evidence
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.7.2.1. Con: A number of [indictments, confessions and convictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Counsel_investigation_\(2017%E2%80%93present\)#Table_of_charges) would disagree
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.7.2.2. Con: [Watergate](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/complete-watergate-timeline-took-longer-realize) took over [2 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Watergate_scandal) to produce results. And that was only a resignation due to the spectre of impeachment. The investigation was then ended a month later by a pardon before criminal charges could be pressed, which would have taken longer still.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.7.3. Con: The investigation has expanded to include obstruction.  Collusion has not been abandoned, as evidenced by recent reports by [Sam Nunberg](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/03/former-campaign-aide-sam-nunberg-says-trump-may-have-colluded-with-russia) and [Michael Caputo](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/collusion-trump-adviser-details-interview-special-counsels-team/story?id=54895701) of what the Mueller team asked them about.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.7.4. Con: There is no evidence that the investigation has 'moved on'--Unless a public report is released we wont know the full scope of the investigation or all of the angles Robert Mueller is pursuing.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.8. Con: Misbehavior by Trump's associates is [not grounds](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section4) to impeach him.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.8.1. Con: Trump could be considered to have [imputed knowledge](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=493006020002127025071017092108064122055021026063030057104020113005083029097060027048108120037005112022123076066009029092045044003004021110027094124113065070090080034116069020009122123021118117019118091108070109095122125079113122088093127119099&EXT=pdf) of \(and thus legal liability for\) misdeeds of his subordinates in the course of campaign duties if those misdeeds were done for the benefit of the campaign.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.9. Con: "Collusion" is very much in the eye of the beholder.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.9.1. Con: Collusion is not in the eye of the beholder at all. It is a provable pattern of interaction, communication, and efforts to reach a goal common to the parties in collusion.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.9.2. Pro: It could be argued that politics is full of collusion and is therefore effectively no different to anything the Democrats did.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.9.2.1. Pro: Democrats are equally guilty of collusion, after coordinating with the chair of the democratic national committee to receive [pre-debate information](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/07/donna-brazile-is-totally-not-sorry-for-leaking-cnn-debate-questions-to-hillary-clinton/?utm_term=.92d65c8dd789) to help prepare for it.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.9.2.2. Con: Collusion itself is not a crime. [However](https://globalnews.ca/news/4362409/is-collusion-a-crime/), [working with a foreign powe](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7/31/17634146/trump-collusion-crime-russia-mueller)r to sway an election is a crime in both campaign finance, election fraud, hacking, and even wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud the United States, which actually meets the standards for Treason.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.9.2.2.1. Pro: [Any citizen of the United States](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/953), wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States...
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.9.2.2.2. Pro: For example, if someone sought “dirt” on a candidate from the Russians \(a foreign power\), he might be charged with conspiring to violate the election laws of the United States, which prohibit foreign nationals from contributing any “thing of value” to an electoral campaign.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.9.2.2.3. Pro: Although the term Collusion is often used, and itself is [not a legally recognised crime](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/12/what-is-collusion-215366), the actual legal term would be "Conspiracy", which is indeed a crime.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.10. Pro: Trump [publicly asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UutkJGJaMxE) for Russian help to hack Clinton at a rally.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.10.1. Con: [Experts agree that](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/us/hillary-clintons-email-was-probably-hacked-experts-say.html) Clinton's private server had probably been hacked by Russia. Trump was speaking on this when he made his remark. His [exact quote](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/elections/100000004554702/trump-urges-russia-to-locate-clinton-emails.html) is "I hope that you are able to find the 30K emails that are missing." When the quote was made the servers were already offline and [in possession of the FBI](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clintons-e-mail-server-turned-over-to-fbi/2015/08/12/aba5feea-4160-11e5-8ab4-c73967a143d3_story.html?utm_term=.3cb5d508306e). The only possible way Russia could find the emails is if they had previously hacked Clinton's server. Asking Russia to return stolen information is not the same as asking them to steal.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.10.1.1. Con: Asking them, a foreign power, to publicly disclose them, to boost or improve his own campaign, would be a violation of campaign contribution laws, which prohibit a foreign power from making any substantial contribution to a electoral campaign.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.10.1.1.1. Con: In-kind contributions are ["Goods or services offered free or at less than the usual charge"](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/types-contributions/) There is no usual charge for the release of politically damaging information.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.11. Pro: If the election was tampered with he may truly be an illegitimate president.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.11.1. Con: Election tampering would not have occurred at a time when Trump was President. As impeachable conduct can only occur within the scope of the Office of the Presidency, such tampering, even if discovered, would likely not be impeachable.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.11.1.1. Pro: Trump was informed of the tampering by our intelligence officers and disregarded the proof which means he is guilty of obstruction of justice and High Crimes and Misdemeanors
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.11.2. Pro: Trump requested that Russia 'find the emails' on live TV and that night his political opponent's had her party's emails put out into the public to make her look un trustworthy. He directly conspired with Russia to create mistrust in his opponent. During the campaign.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.11.3. Con: "Tampering" would be preventing votes from being cast or counted, or casting and counting illegal votes.  There is no evidence to suggest that occurred.  A "Misinformed" vote is still a legal vote.
1.1.5.2.10.1.11.11.3.1. Pro: There is proof that actual voting machines were remotely hacked and that voter rolls were hacked and deleted.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12. Con: Trump is guilty of obstruction of justice.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.1. Pro: It appears that Trump has interfered with the investigation of the Russian Hack of the 2016 election.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.1.1. Con: An appearance of interference is not proof of interference.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.1.1.1. Con: An appearance of interference is sufficient grounds to investigate underlying circumstances and assess whether a legal criminal case for obstruction of justice is appropriate
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.2. Con: While the appearance is there, there has been no legally acceptable proof of obstruction yet. A proceeding cannot be started on accusation alone, no matter how strong the implications may be. Once court admissible evidence is introduced, then actions can proceed.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.2.1. Con: In a breach of long-standing norms of ethical behavior, Trump has repeatedly and publicly stated that he fired the head of the FBI to obstruct an investigation into collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russian foreign agents.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.3. Pro: Trump admitted to firing Comey because of the Russia investigation in an [interview with Lester Holt](https://www.vox.com/2017/5/11/15628276/trump-comey-fired-russia).
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.3.1. Pro: The fact that Trump told FBI director James Comey to drop the Flynn investigation is supported by Comey's contemporaneous memos: [www.documentcloud.org](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4442900-Ex-FBI-Director-James-Comey-s-memos.html)
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.3.2. Pro: Trump obstructed justice by threatening Comey to stay silent about his conversations with Trump with the specter of tapes of their conversations.  This is relevant because Comey’s conversations with Trump are evidence of obstruction of justice on Trump’s part, so Trump was obstructing an obstruction investigation into him.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.3.3. Pro: Trump’s lawyer [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/03/trump-fire-comey-reason-rudy-giuliani-566043) told Sean Hannity that Trump “fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation.  He’s entitled to that. Hillary Clinton got that and he couldn’t get that. So he fired him and he said, ‘I’m free of this guy.’"
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.3.4. Pro: The [original draft](https://www.wsj.com/article_email/trump-drafted-letter-on-why-he-wanted-comey-out-1504303851-lMyQjAxMTA3MTA1MTcwNTE1Wj/) of Trump’s letter firing Comey makes clear that the reason for the firing was the Russia investigation.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.3.5. Pro: The official White House [minutes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/us/politics/trump-russia-comey.html) of Trump’s Oval Office meeting with the Russian ambassador and Russian foreign minutes say that Trump told them “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.4. Pro: Trump obstructed justice by [dictating Don Jr](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/02/us/politics/trump-legal-documents.html).’s misleading statement about the June 9 Trump Tower meeting.  The dictation of the statement was admitted by Trump’s own lawyers in their letter to the Mueller team.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.5. Pro: Trump obstructed justice by [forcing Rosenstein](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-orders-doj-campaign-infiltrated/story?id=55309163) to disclose certain details about confidential human sources in the Russia investigation to Devin Nunes and other House Republicans.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6. Pro: Donald Trump [committed obstruction of justice](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/flynns-plea-raises-new-questions-about-whether-trump-obstructed-justice/547328/) by asking the FBI not to investigate Michael Flynn. It is therefore likely that Trump knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI about the campaign's contact with Russian officials, but still suggested that the FBI drop its investigation.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.1. Pro: The obstruction statute does not require the person doing the obstruction to know that the person under investigation is guilty, but such knowledge strengthens an obstruction case.  And we have evidence of such knowledge in this case, because Trump tweeted that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI and that's why he fired him: [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/937007006526959618)
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.2. Pro: The fact that Trump told FBI director James Comey to drop the Flynn investigation is confirmed by Comey’s contemporaneous memos: [www.documentcloud.org](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4442900-Ex-FBI-Director-James-Comey-s-memos.html)
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3. Con: President Trump has not obstructed investigation on Flynn. The investigation has not stopped.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.1. Con: The obstruction statute is about *attempts* to obstruct justice, it does not require an investigation to actually be stopped.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.1.1. Pro: [Here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1503) is what the obstruction statute says: “Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, endeavors to influence, intimidate, or impede any grand or petit juror, or officer in or of any court of the United States, or officer who may be serving at any examination or other proceeding before any United States magistrate judge...”
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.2. Con: The investigation has not stopped because there is evidence that may contradict this claim directly. Trump asked Comey to "Let the Flynn thing go", testified to by FBI Director James Comey. Investigation will examine this action to see if it meets the legal definition of obstruction.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.2.1. Con: Unfortunately due to the evidence of [Comey letters being altered](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/363194-former-fbi-agent-changed-comeys-language-of-clinton-email-use-to) based on political motivations, this becomes a he said argument, which will likely not hold up in court.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.2.1.1. Con: The linked story is not about the [Comey memos](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4442900-Ex-FBI-Director-James-Comey-s-memos.html), but about Comey’s statement exonerating Hillary Clinton.  That is what Peter Strzok edited.  There is no evidence that anyone ever edited the Comey memos.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.2.1.2. Con: This has nothing to do with what will hold up in court.  The Department of Justice does not believe it has the authority to indict a sitting President.  So if Mueller finds sufficient evidence that Trump is guilty of federal crimes, the procedure he would follow would be to report those crimes to Congress so they can begin impeachment proceedings.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.2.1.3. Con: The Inspector General [found](https://www.justice.gov/file/1071991/download) that the editing of Comey’s statement exonerating Hillary Clinton was not influenced by improper considerations.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.2.2. Con: Comey himself during an interview stated that at no point did he feel pressured to "[let Flynn go"](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/02/531116018/did-james-comey-lie-about-interference-in-the-russia-investigation)
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.2.2.1. Con: Comey [was speaking about](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jun/06/context-james-comeys-past-comments-interference-fb/) whether or not he was being pressured by senior officials in the Department of Justice, not about the President of the United States.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.3. Con: "I wasn't successful" isn't a legitimate defense against an obstruction of justice charge
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.4. Pro: It is [Muller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Counsel_investigation_\(2017%E2%80%93present\)), not Comey, who was directly running the investigation into Flynn's actions.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.4.1. Con: The investigation nevertheless fell within Comey's jurisdiction, for he was [the director](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Comey) of the organisation conducting the investigation.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.4.2. Con: Mueller was not appointed at the time.  Mueller was only appointed by Rod Rosenstein [after Trump fired](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231/download)Comey. So when Trump told Comey to drop the Flynn investigation, he was talking to the person overseeing it.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.4.2.1. Pro: In fact, part of the reason that Mueller was appointed was because of reports that Trump had told Comey to drop the Flynn investigation.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.4. Con: The view posted here is an opinion that does not align with [Comey's](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/02/531116018/did-james-comey-lie-about-interference-in-the-russia-investigation) own testimony related to the matter, where he stated he was not pressured or asked to stop the investigation. The accusations are based on politics and not the standing or commentary from the individuals
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.4.1. Con: [Comey's testimony](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html) suggests that Trump told him "I hope you can let this \[- the investigation into Flynn - \] go", which can be read as a thinly-veiled request that the investigation be dropped.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.3.2.2.1.
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.5. Con: A president can not be charged for exercising his constitutionally granted powers.  [This includes firing subordinates for any reason or no reason at all.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers_v._United_States)
1.1.5.2.10.1.12.6.5.1. Con: It is true that Trump had the constitutional authority to end the Flynn investigation and to fire Comey.  But exercising your constitutional authority for a corrupt purpose can still run afoul of various federal laws including obstructrtion statutes.  See this whitepaper by the Brookings Institution: [www.brookings.edu](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/presidential-obstruction-of-justice-the-case-of-donald-j-trump-final.pdf)
1.1.5.2.10.1.13. Con: Trump has twice violated [Article II](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/articles/article-ii/article-ii-section-3-by-saikrishna-prakash/clause/38) of the Constitution, which requires the President to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed", by failing to execute bills passed by Congress to their legal letter.
1.1.5.2.10.1.13.1. Pro: Trump [changed](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/10/17/16489526/take-care-clause-obamacare-trump-sabotage-aca-illegal) his enforcement of the ACA in an avowed attempt to destroy the law.
1.1.5.2.10.1.13.2. Pro: Trump f[ailed to institute](https://www.thedailybeast.com/congress-trump-wont-implement-russia-sanctionsand-he-wont-tell-us-why) any of the sanctions against Russia that were passed by Congress and signed by Trump in early August.
1.1.5.2.10.1.13.3. Con: While this is true and certainly a good reason for Congress to impeach a President, we have seen the same behavior from the last several Presidents who blatantly refuse to enforce laws with which they disagree. Impeaching a President now, based on this behavior would be a stunning change in precedence.
1.1.5.2.10.1.13.4. Con: Sanctions [were implemented](https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Foreign-Assets-Control.aspx). The only proponent of the sanctions that was not implemented were military pieces that would have stopped activity with Syria.
1.1.5.2.10.1.13.5. Con: Congress passed the bills associated with [ACA](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-gop-senate-tax-reform-bill-health-care-impact-2017-12) that impacted it. Trump's actions were only related to [EO's](https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/healthcare/), which he is authorized/legally allowed to override.
1.1.5.2.11. Con: Trump has been making damaging changes to the makeup of government agencies. This is likely to continue if he is not stopped, with serious and long term damage to the nation.
1.1.5.2.11.1. Con: These claims are subjective, as it is not generally agreed that these actions are negative for the country. Criminality, and not policy opinion, should determine whether or not a president is impeached.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1. Con: Since some of these administrative agencies are created to enforce duly adopted law, attempting to undermine their functions violates the [President's Constitutionally mandated oath to "faithfully execute the office."](http://americanhistory.si.edu/presidency/1b2.html)
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1. Pro: Hypothetically, a pacifist President who chose to use his/her office to unilaterally disband or inhibit the function of particular branches of the American military would expect to face calls for impeachment as well.
1.1.5.2.11.2. Pro: Trump has [hollowed out](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/29/567133958/a-diplomat-on-the-reported-hollowing-out-of-the-state-department) the State Department.
1.1.5.2.11.3. Pro: Trump has [downsized the EPA](https://www.propublica.org/article/brain-drain-at-the-epa), as well as many other agencies.
1.1.5.2.11.4. Con: None of the provided information is against the law to the extent that they could result in impeachment nor do they have any defined negative impact
1.1.5.2.11.4.1. Con: The information challenges the claim that Trump's actions have been primarily positive.
1.1.5.2.11.5. Con: With relation to the "state department", it appears the department's actions and activity over the past year have been largely [proactive](https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2017/12/276570.htm) without showing any negative impact in accordance to "hollowing out". this reduction may actually be more akin to a "cutting the fat/waste". In addition, the hollowing out is based on [Tillerson's](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/12/politics/tillerson-state-department-town-hall/index.html) call, not Trump
1.1.5.2.11.6. Con: The EPA reduction \(per the provided link\) was a departure based on a new administration taking over, which is typical. Additionally, the EPA's job over the past 12 years has [expanded](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/us/critics-hear-epas-voice-in-public-comments.html) way outside it's bounds. from a regulatory rule provider to define state requirements to a police force and bureaucratic agency. Frequent issues around the EPA stepping on FBI and OSHA's toes mean it needs to be [reined](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/245201-drowning-by-epa-overreach) in.
1.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.10.1.11.
1.1.6. Con: This argument could be used for every future president.  All presidents have the potential to make a poor decision, therefore all should be impeached.
1.1.6.1. Pro: This argument could also be made for every person. The claim in question holds as much influence as the statement 'The only way to prevent insider trading is to prematurely fire everyone with the opportunity to share insider information'. Impeachment on grounds of the opportunity to commit a misdeed is a ridiculous proposition especially considering how much power the president of the United States is granted. Not to mention that it is [not grounds for impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment#Impeachable_offenses).
1.1.7. Con: It's not a decision the public get to make, it's system protocols, overruling protocols by popular pressure is more dangerous than he is.
1.1.8. Con: People should not be held accountable for "potential actions."
1.1.8.1. Pro: The [presumption of innocence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence) is still a fundamental right in the legal systems of most countries.
1.1.8.1.1. Con: Impeachment is not a criminal proceeding, per se, so the strict presumption of innocence is not as important as the credible check on Executive power.
1.1.8.1.1.1. Pro: Both protections and liabilities are drastically different for an impeached President than for a criminal defendant, indicating that impeachment is a peculiar institution, bound by its own norms, rather than an extension of criminal or civil justice.
1.1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: An impeached president is not tried and convicted by a unanimous decision of a jury of his peers, but by a [2/3 vote of the Senate](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm).
1.1.8.1.1.1.2. Pro: Punishment for impeachment is [limited to removal from office \(and a bar from future office-holding\)](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3-), and an impeached president is not arrested, arraigned, or indicted \(in the criminal sense\).
1.1.8.1.2. Con: A presumption of innocence doesn't hold up when someone expresses the intent to take harmful or illegal actions
1.1.8.2. Con: Cautionary measures sometimes need to be taken to prevent potential damage
1.1.8.3. Con: Having a criminal report weekly to his or her parole officer is a pretty solid example of holding someone accountable for potential actions.
1.1.8.3.1. Con: In this example, the person has already been found guilty of a crime by a jury, so the reporting requirement is an extension of the prior punishment.
1.1.8.4. Con: In many cases it is a benificial strategy to predict using past actions.
1.1.8.5. Con: As a society, we often hold people accountable for their potential actions.
1.1.8.5.1. Pro: If someone is at risk of harming themselves or others, we arrest or hospitalize them.
1.1.8.5.2. Pro: If a judge believes someone accused of a crime might be a flight risk, the judge will deny them bail.
1.1.8.5.3. Pro: If an employee says things that suggest he or she might be harmful to the company, his or her employer will fire that employee.
1.1.8.5.4. Pro: If another nation threatens our safety, we may pre-emptively attack that nation.
1.1.9. Pro: It takes more time, money, and effort to undo the effects of bad policy than it does to implement the policy in the first place. Therefore, nullifying potential damage is an important issue.
1.1.9.1. Con: An impeachment would leave the rest of the legislative and executive policy-making apparatuses intact. Unless you contend that Trump himself is the fount of all bad policy, impeachment does little to solve the problem.
1.1.9.1.1. Pro: Evidence shows going back 10+ years the dysfunction has been [escalating](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/opinion/nicholas-kristof-americas-political-dysfunction.html) . Trump has little to do with it other than being the guy in front right now.
1.1.10. Pro: Donald Trump's hardline approach has posed significant danger to the rest of the world. Impeaching him would stop him from taking it too far.
1.1.10.1. Pro: Donald Trump's disregard for the value of the work of the previous administration, and drastic shift from it, has eroded longterm international confidence in the USA as a reliable partner on trade, military support, and other international interests, and has resulted in lost investor confidence of its bond holders and closest trade partners[International view of the USA](http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/06/26/u-s-image-suffers-as-publics-around-world-question-trumps-leadership/). Impeachment may restore international confidence in the stability of the USA.
1.1.10.2. Con: Impeaching Trump while the United States is involved in  serious confrontations with other nations could put our national security at risk.
1.1.10.2.1. Con: Since many of these confrontations are driven by Trump's comments, removing him will also remove the threat to national security.
1.1.10.2.2. Pro: If the Congress and Senate would agree that Trump is a threat and act as the "checks and balances" they should be, then America could stabilize. The government needs balance and neither branch is stepping up.
1.1.10.3. Con: Trump is taking what appears to be extreme measures to set America up for success in the 21st century.
1.1.10.3.1. Con: While reform is probably long overdue in the US, whether Trumps actions will yield success or not are no grounds for impeachment. Illegality and misconduct are.
1.1.10.4. Pro: Donald Trump's decision to move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem led to [riots and deaths](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/08/palestinian-shot-dead-in-gaza-as-protesters-clash-with-israeli-troops-in-west-bank) overseas.
1.1.10.5. Pro: [Trump's antagonising](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/10/trump-continues-to-tease-a-war-with-north-korea.html) of North Korea could bring the two countries closer to nuclear confrontation, which would be devastating.
1.1.10.5.1. Con: Trump's lack of tact associated with communicating with individuals does not change the last several years of threats from North Korea and the North Korean government, along with their actions against the US.
1.1.10.5.2. Con: Trump's 'peace through strength' is a viable way to achieve security on the peninsula.
1.1.10.5.2.1. Pro: Trump is [putting pressure](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/19/us-and-china-agree-to-maximise-pressure-on-north-korea) on China to act because a stronger and more forwarded military posture by the US is seen as a threat in Beijing.
1.1.10.5.2.1.1. Con: China is simply appeasing Trump and establishing its position on North Korea for its own independent needs. China has [no intention](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-china-isnt-ready-to-put-pressure-on-north-korea) to fully follow the US's policy of 'strategic strangulation'.
1.1.10.5.2.2. Pro: Under Obama's '[strategic patience](https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2017/09/04/on-north-korea-strategic-patience-has-enabled-strategic-blackmail/)' policy North Korea was allowed to develop nuclear technology.
1.1.10.5.2.3. Pro: Provocation is a legitimate tool of diplomacy that has been used throughout history.
1.1.10.5.3. Pro: His method of communicating with potentially dangerous countries such as North Korea, is a senseless and nothing more than an immature display of provocation.
1.1.10.5.3.1. Con: Fear is not a position to negotiate from. As the US is the most powerful nation on the planet, placating dictators and aggressors because of their capabilities is a poor practice and belies this fact.
1.1.10.5.3.1.1. Con: Fear does not need to be the stance to operate from; however needlessly provoking the enemy to act in ways that might put innocent lives in danger, is not rational and is more risky than just letting things play out. Being firm and confident if fine, but being immature and cocky is unreasonable.
1.1.10.5.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.5.2.2.
1.1.10.5.3.2. Con: His communication style is not an impeachable offense.
1.1.10.5.4. Con: There is no direct link between Trump's "antagonism" and a Nuclear War. North Korea [has made progress with it's missle program](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-missile-tests-a-timeline/) for many years under many presidents.  This has been a consistent policy across presidents [of both political parties](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/26/us-developing-missile-shield-to-guard-against-nuclear-attack-fro/).  Impeaching Trump likely wouldn't change this strategy.
1.1.10.5.5. Pro: The amount of capability that North Korea has displayed with their [ICBM program](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/latest-north-korean-icbm-capable-of-reaching-us-so-now-what/), is staggering. They are becoming more of a possible threat, for the US mainland and allied countries. This is something serious to consider when you are The President of the United States.
1.1.10.5.6. Con: North Korea is a very oppressive country and the US therefore has a responsibility to take a strong stance against them.
1.1.10.5.6.1. Pro: North Korea has been a rogue state for 70 years and [severely oppresses](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/north-korea) its own people while its leader reportedly lives a [very lavish life](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jong-un-spent-over-600m-in-a-year-while-north-korean-citizens-starved-to-death-9145059.html).  Trump came along and said enough is enough so this is in no way grounds for impeaching Trump.
1.1.10.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.5.
1.1.10.7. Con: To say his presidency is dangerous is somewhat ambiguous as all actions have plausible results which are dangerous.
1.1.10.7.1. Pro: Danger is inherent in our world
1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.10.1.
1.3. Pro: Some people believe he has committed treason.
1.3.1. Pro: Former intelligence chief john Brennan [believes Trump committed treason](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/john-brennan-donald-trump-treasonous-vladimir-putin/index.html) by [saying things Brennan didn't like](https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-backs-vladimir-putin-against-us-intelligence-agencies-over-election-meddling-claims-11439065) about US intelligence agencies during a press conference with Vladimir Putin.
1.3.1.1. Con: John Brennan is a [political](https://andmagazine.com/us/1527014711.html) [hack](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-09-08/untold-truth-about-obamas-former-cia-director-john-brennan)
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Part of that is written by Sam Faddis a retired CIA operations officer, published author, \(civilian\) military consultant and national security commentator...who happens to be running as a pro-Trump Republican senate candidate for Maryland. Hardly an impartial source himself.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Sam Faddis headed the Counter Terrorism Center \(CTC\)’s Weapons of Mass Destruction unit charged with pursuing terrorist weapons of mass destruction programs worldwide in 2003, specifically in Iraq. That turned out so well.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Sam Faddis has published a book "[Beyond Repair: Decline of the CIA](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Repair-Decline-Fall-CIA-ebook/dp/B0030GGFPU/)" attacking the very organisation he served and left. While not attacking the people working for it, he believes it needs to be replaced as it cannot do its job. Noteably he is extremely critical and disdainful of non-field agents and the leadership of the CIA.
1.3.2. Pro: CNN has committed [over 7 hours in one day](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/geoffrey-dickens/2018/07/19/obsessed-cnn-devotes-over-7-hours-trumps-summit-treason) to discussing whether Trump has committed treason.
1.3.2.1. Con: That does not support the argument that he committed treason - it is just an air-filler.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: CNN could spend 7 hours discussing whether Trump is secretly a lizard, but that doesn't make Trump a lizard.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: CNN could spend 7 hours discussing whether Trump is secretly a member of the illuminati, but that doesn't make Trump a member of the illuminati. And/Or a lizard.
1.3.3. Con: The people who believe Trump has committed treason, the penalty for which is death, appear to be suffering from a [cognitive dissonance](http://blog.dilbert.com/2018/05/26/episode-81-how-to-spot-cognitive-dissonance/) disorder that therapists are calling Trump Anxiety Disorder \([TAD](https://palmettonews-opinion.com/therapists-are-coining-the-phrase-trump-anxiety-disorder/)\) also known by some as [Trump Derangement Syndrome](http://blog.dilbert.com/2018/05/17/episode-69-how-to-guide-a-victim-out-of-trump-derangement-syndrome-tds/),
1.3.3.1. Con: Many [therapists claim](http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/07/30/psychiatrist-debunks-trump-anxiety-disorder-says-it-partisan-pop-psychology) there is no such thing as TAD or [TDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Derangement_Syndrome) and it is instead "partisan pop psychology". It is [not an official,](https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/38179-trump-anxiety-disorder) recognised diagnoses. Even if there were anxiety, many would consider it [justifiable](https://www.rt.com/uk/435026-icymi-trump-anxiety-disorder/) given the presidents actions.
1.3.3.2. Con: Accusing his political critics of mental illness is a tactic used to absolve Trump of any guilt and distract from the issue
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Ironically this is precisely what Trump's critics [allege](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_of_Donald_Trump) of him.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Donald Trumps behaviour has become increasingly Paranoid and Erratic of late, with frequent alleged examples of memory lapse.
1.3.4. Pro: Rachel Maddow believes it "[feels very palpable ... that the President is subordinate to a foreign power."](https://www.breitbart.com/video/2018/07/21/maddow-feels-very-palpable-that-the-president-is-a-foreign-agent/)
1.3.4.1. Con: One journalist's "belief" does not prove the truth of the matter.
1.3.5. Pro: [Siding with](https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-backs-vladimir-putin-against-us-intelligence-agencies-over-election-meddling-claims-11439065) a hostile foreign government over our own intelligence agencies is considered treason.
1.3.6. Pro: President Trump has been implicated in several [Federal Crimes](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/21/politics/michael-cohen-plea-deal-talks/index.html) that could be considered [Treason](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/cohen-implicated-trump-court-how-he-did-it-could-be-n902761), such as [criminal conspiracy](https://www.newyorker.com/news-desk/swamp-chronicles/the-president-has-been-implicated-in-a-criminal-conspiracy) to mislead the American Public, election tampering, [election interference](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-michael-cohen-trial-campaign-us-president-impeachment-a8502421.html), deliberate and malicious [campaign finance violations](https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/donald-trumps-former-lawyer-implicates-him-in-campaign-finance-crime/news-story/be59fdd7b533d243871a7db113b001ab) with the intent to "mislead and influence the election."
1.3.7. Pro: The Trump campaign \(and thus Trump himself\) is under investigation for Conspiracy \(the legal correct term for Collusion\) and Election tampering with ties to a foreign government \(Russia\).
1.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.10.1.11.
1.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.10.1.11.
1.3.9. Con: And some people think that the earth is flat. That doesn't make it true.
1.3.10. Pro: Notable left wing TV talkshow personality Joy Behar [has proclaimed](https://grabien.com/story.php?id=191763) Trump committed treason in his meeting with Putin in Helsinki.
1.4. Pro: He is guilty of bribery.
1.4.1. Pro: Trump has paid money or favor to people to influence their conduct - that is the [definition](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bribe) of bribery.
1.4.1.1. Pro: He [paid Stephanie Clifford](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/trump-hush-payment-stormy-daniels.html) \(Stormy Daniels\) to stay silent about their sexual relations.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Trump has been recorded discussing a silencing payment to [Karen McDougal](http://abc11.com/politics/trump-recording-secretly-made-by-personal-attorney-released/3819006/) to prevent her from discussing an alleged affair with him.
1.5. Pro: Trump may well be a pathological liar, [according to his own Lawyers](https://secondnexus.com/news/trump-mueller-practice-session-lies/?utm_content=inf_10_1164_2&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_5776e9f0b08511e8872dc93302272904).
1.5.1. Pro: Since he took office, President Trump [has made](https://secondnexus.com/news/donald-trump-bob-woodward-credibility-problems/1/) more than [4229](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) factually inaccurate claims or comments.
1.6. Con: Attempting to impeach President Trump would be a waste of time, money, and effort that could be spent on more important issues.
1.6.1. Con: The current situation could be a chance for democratic education: people will finally see that this type of politics is bad - like a vaccination, so no impeachment now
1.6.2. Pro: Impeachment is a distraction from other efforts and legislation where there is a possibility making progress and creating value.
1.6.3. Pro: Trying to impeach Trump with a Republican controlled House would be a waste of time.
1.6.3.1. Con: The "Party in charge" has nothing to do with valid articles of impeachment being presented.
1.6.3.2. Pro: The party in charge has the majority vote so they do have more control over the Impeachment proceedings, but any members of Congress can recommend charges as has already been done in the case of Donald Trump.
1.6.4. Pro: Seeking impeachment now, before the conclusion of Mueller's investigation, would be premature and therefore unlikely to succeed.
1.6.4.1. Pro: There is probably only one real shot to impeach Trump.  A failed impeachment attempt while the GOP controls the House and Senate would likely prevent a more likely impeachment after the midterm elections.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: This is a tactical argument, and it's worth noting that any early impeachment attempt - while the GOP controls Congress - would be brought to order by the GOP-led Congress.  This scenario is highly unlikely to occur unless the GOP-led Congress plans to impeach, and if they don't the claim becomes moot.
1.6.4.2. Pro: The special prosecutor should be allowed to finish his investigation, to protect future US elections from meddling by foreign agents. Impeaching Trump too soon might end the investigation.
1.6.4.3. Con: Impeachment could be sought for grounds outside of the core purpose of the Mueller investigation.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: Impeachable offenses, such as confessing to obstruction of justice before a national television audience or dereliction of duty to defend the citizens of the US, have been plainly observed by Members of Congress, which is the presiding body over impeachment proceedings.
1.6.4.3.2. Con: Impeachment requires charges, not the presence of an investigation
1.6.4.3.3. Con: Specific charges imply a legitimate reason for initiating impeachment. Shopping for charges does not.
1.6.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Attempting impeachment before the outcome of the midterms \(and proportion of sympathetic congress seats\) in the House and Senate could also make the timing poor.
1.6.5. Con: Under that logic arresting people for petty crimes would also be a waste of time, money and effort.
1.6.6. Con: That it would take effort and resources from another place is not alone a good enough reason to not attempt impeachment proceedings. The [opportunity cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp) may very well be worth it.
1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.1.9.
1.6.8. Pro: Activists and voters have [limited time, energy, and emotional capacity](https://www.npr.org/sections/theprotojournalist/2014/07/25/334101621/the-diagnosis-politics-fatigue-syndrome). Focusing on impeachment will necessarily detract from other efforts.
1.6.9. Pro: Impeaching Trump would result in Pence becoming President. There is little difference in the policy preferences of Trump and Pence, so impeachment would accomplish little.
1.6.9.1. Con: If the president engaged in unlawful activity worthy of impeachment, he/she should be impeached, regardless of how good/bad the vice president is. Your opinion of the next in line for office is irrelevant when considering whether an impeachment is called for.
1.6.9.2. Pro: Pence will become president, which is worse than a Trump presidency.
1.6.9.2.1. Pro: It will result in an open seat when Pence chooses a VP.
1.6.9.2.1.1. Con: Pence is not required to select a sitting congressman as [Vice President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States#Succession_and_the_Twenty-Fifth_Amendment).  He can appoint anyone as long as it meets the approval of half both houses of congress.
1.6.9.2.2. Con: There will probably be grounds for removing Pence as well \(he is complicit [slate.com](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/05/mike_pence_is_complicit.html)\)
1.6.9.2.3. Con: Whether that is desirable or not, it is still ostensibly better than a continued Trump Presidency.
1.6.9.2.4. Pro: Pence is more likely to pass legislation. Given he has expressed oppressive views on gay rights, amongst other things, this would be more dangerous than a Trump administration.
1.6.9.2.4.1. Con: Mike Pence is less unpredictable than Donald Trump, and more likely to compromise on his views to keep popular support.
1.6.9.2.4.2. Pro: Pence has the intellect and support from his Republican peers to pass significant conservative legislation.
1.6.9.2.4.3. Pro: Despite Trump's voracity, he has fewer conservative allies and has yet to pass significant legislation.
1.6.9.2.4.3.1. Con: Beyond legislation, Trump has been active by making major appointments to positions such as the supreme court.
1.6.9.2.4.3.2. Con: Trump passed the highly significant [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act_of_2017) in December.
1.6.9.2.4.4. Con: While Pence is more likely to succeed in the harmful agenda he would be likely to pursue, Trump is more dangerous because of his chaotic and unpredictable behavior. There is a far higher chance with Trump of, for example, inciting other nations to war by thoughtlessness than with Pence.
1.6.9.2.5. Con: Mike Pence, being Trump's running mate, might also turn out to be involved in whatever gets Trump impeached \(e.g. collusion with Russia\), and thus may also be removed from office. A Paul Ryan presidency would not be worse than a Trump presidency.
1.6.9.2.6. Pro: Some policies supported by Pence are more extreme than the ones held by Trump, which could have more negative effects than under Trump.
1.6.9.2.7. Con: -> See 1.6.9.2.4.4.
1.6.9.3. Con: There are [significant differences](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/4/13162996/mike-pence-donald-trump-disagree-issues) in policy preferences.
1.6.9.3.1. Con: It is true that Trump’s “true beliefs” differ in a lot of ways from Mike Pence’s beliefs, but Trump’s actual policies and decisions as President are largely the same ones that Pence would pursue if he were President.  Trump has basically outsourced his decision making to Republican advisors and members of Congress.
1.6.10. Con: The decision of "worth it" \(waste\) is a reflection of an individual's personal values. The argument makes an assumption of risk vs reward, which is inherently personal and thus indeterminate.
1.6.11. Con: This is the [fallacy of relative privation](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/155/Relative-Privation). It attempts to cast anything other than a perfect solution as a poor one by virtue of requiring investment that could go towards the \(hypothesised\) perfect one. Following to the conclusion, any time, money, or effort invested in anything less than the ideal course of action are wasted, even though they may achieve results.
1.6.11.1. Con: There is no logical fallacy. Relative Privation is "Trying to make a scenario appear better or worse by comparing it to the best or worst case scenario." No such comparison is made in the claim.
If Relative Privation is applied as suggested any evaluation of how resources should be allocated would be a fallacy.
1.6.12. Pro: There are other ways to hold Trump accountable for his actions that do not require something as tumultuous as impeachment.
1.6.12.1. Pro: When a President's party does poorly in a midterm election, [it is generally seen as a rejection of his presidency](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/politics/democratic-wave-election-2018/index.html). Therefore, dissatisfied voters can hold Trump accountable by voting for Democratic candidates in the 2018 election.
1.6.12.2. Pro: People who were wronged by Trump can bring civil suits against him to be compensated for the harm.
1.6.12.2.1. Con: [Nixon v. Fitzgerald](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/731) established a doctrine of "Presidential Immunity" whereby Donald Trump cannot be held personally liable for his actions within the scope of presidential duties. People who suffered damages due to Trump's actions as President cannot sue him.
1.6.12.2.1.1. Con: [Nixon v. Fitzgerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_v._Fitzgerald) and the presidential immunity doctrine do not protect the President from acts committed prior to his tenure as President. Given that he has harmed many people prior to assuming the presidency, the Presidential Immunity Doctrine does not apply to those cases.
1.6.12.2.1.1.1. Pro: A woman was able to [proceed with a sexual harassment lawsuit against President Bill Clinton](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/28/opinion/the-limits-of-presidential-immunity.html), while he was in office, arising from his conduct while Governor of Arkansas.
1.6.12.2.1.1.2. Pro: The Presidential Immunity Doctrine only covers actions of the office of the president. It does not protect him if he were to do something illicit in office that is not part of the duties of the president.
1.6.12.2.1.1.2.1. Con: The problem here is that Nixon v. Fitzgerald \(and the Constitution\) are fuzzy on where exactly the "duties of the President" end. There are legitimate [legal opinions which interpret these duties so broadly as to effectively immunize any sitting president from any lawsuit](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/presidents-immune-civil-lawsuits-state-court-private-conduct), and the courts have not really settled many questions on the matter. [Zervos v. Trump](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellefabio/2017/12/06/ny-judge-to-decide-whether-defamation-lawsuit-against-trump-can-move-forward/#15d8b28d68fd), for example will set precedent on whether a sitting president can be sued in a state court.
1.6.12.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Trumps lawyer is trying to classify the statement of "liar" as political opinion, additionally the "cousin" of [Zervos](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/301156-trump-campaign-releases-statement-from-accusers-cousin)has come forward to refute her previously.
1.6.12.2.1.1.3. Con: While Presidential Immunity is undoubtedly limited in scope, it does mean that not all people who are wronged by Donald Trump have legal recourse outside of impeachment. People can be wronged within the scope of Presidential duties and powers.
1.6.12.3. Pro: Important executive appointments and all federal judicial appointments must be [approved by the Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent). Congress can hold Trump accountable by refusing to approve his nominees.
1.6.12.4. Pro: Trump can be held accountable by voting him out of office in 2020.
1.6.12.4.1. Pro: Trump is [unlikely to be reelected anyway](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/). It may not be worth the effort, and [impeachment is no guarantee of removal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States), because it is just an indictment, not a conviction. No U.S. president has ever been removed from office after impeachment. Jackson and Clinton were acquitted, and Nixon resigned on his own before being impeached.
1.6.12.4.2. Con: If he deserves to be impeached, it should be done immediately.
1.6.12.4.2.1. Pro: If you run with that premise, any elected official could do whatever they pleased regardless of the law, untill their next election.
1.6.12.4.3. Con: An election every four years does not provide enough of a check on a president who is unfit and abusing the power of the office.
1.6.12.5. Pro: Impeachment should only be used in the most dire circumstances.  The checks and balances in the government are working, just like the worked when Obama was President or when Bush was President.
1.6.13. Pro: It is likely that impeachment would not achieve the goal of holding Trump accountable for his wrongdoings.
1.6.13.1. Con: The purpose of impeachment is removal from office, not the administration of justice.
1.6.13.2. Pro: Like President Gerald Ford, a President Pence would likely use his executive power to [pardon his predecessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon).
1.6.13.3. Pro: Impeaching Donald Trump would not bring about the justice he or his associates deserve. Instead we should focus on the special council investigation. The entire administration needs to be brought down. This presidency cannot stand as it is a threat to our democracy as a whole.
1.7. Pro: Trump should be impeached because he is mentally and physically unfit to serve as President.
1.7.1. Con: The [25th Amendment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-could-be-removed-for-political-incompetence--using-the-25th-amendment/2017/09/12/b6c62380-9718-11e7-82e4-f1076f6d6152_story.html?utm_term=.630756bb30d9) provides a separate process for removing a physically or mentally unfit President.  Impeachment is not necessary.
1.7.2. Con: There is no evidence that President Trump is mentally or physically unfit to serve as President. Only the opinions of people who are politically liberal and don't like what he says and does.
1.7.3. Pro: [Senility is apparent](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/donald-trump-brain-health) in his speech patterns. He is the most aged person to serve as President of the USA.
1.7.3.1. Con: Trump has been exhibiting the symptoms compatible with senility such as "memory loss," poor judgment, impaired concentration, and confusion since he was much younger \(at least before the election\). The evidence of memory loss, in particular, may actually just be Trump deliberately misrepresenting his memories.
1.7.3.2. Con: The opinions being laid as claims do not meet the needs to provide a medical diagnosis of [dementia or any other mental condition.](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_steps_to_diagnosis.asp) given the lack of a medical exam by those laying the claim.
1.7.4. Pro: The fact that Donald Trump is unable to start work [before 11 am](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-working-day-start-time-11am-us-president-beginning-george-w-bush-barack-obama-a8147366.html) shows that he is unable to fulfil the duties of the office of the president.
1.7.5. Pro: [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/president-trump-unstable-danger-nuclear-war-psychologists-warn-685029) had an article in October where a licensed psychologist and psychotherapist, ostensibly experts in their field\(s\), claimed that Trump is unstable and dangerous.
1.7.5.1. Con: For a therapist to make such a public claim would violate his training and credentials. It is irresponsible to diagnose a person one has not treated.
1.7.5.2. Con: -> See 1.7.3.2.
1.7.6. Pro: Trump is a [pathological liar](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html).
1.7.6.1. Con: All American politicians engage in purposefully misleading rhetoric. Impeaching one particular politician on these grounds would be a meaningless gesture
1.7.6.2. Con: -> See 1.7.3.2.
1.7.7. Pro: Trump has been claimed to have dementia by top psychologists across the Globe, and on various occasions leaked information he should not have. These claims come from prestigious establishments, such as[Yale Conferences.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-0/donald-trump-dangerous-mental-illness-yale-psychiatrist-conference-us-president-unfit-james-gartner-a7694316.html)
1.7.7.1. Con: -> See 1.7.3.2.
1.7.7.2. Con: [The Whitehouse](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Summary-of-Physical-Exam-for-President-Trump-12-Jan-2018.pdf) released Trump's medical review by the White House Physician, which reports Trump's mental health is fine.
1.7.8. Con: -> See 1.7.3.2.
1.7.9. Con: U.S. President Donald Trump passed a test for signs of dementia and is in  [overall excellent health  ​](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-medical/trump-is-fit-for-duty-but-should-hit-the-gym-white-house-doctor-idUSKBN1F52OR)
1.7.9.1. Con: The test for dementia was carried out by the president´s doctor and not by an independent group.
1.8. Con: After the division of the 2016 election America does not need another divisive political drama.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.1.
1.8.2. Con: If the nation survived Bill Clinton's impeachment, it would survive Trump's impeachment.
1.8.2.1. Con: There are too many different variables to make the two situations comparable.
1.8.2.2. Con: The fear of some is not the fate of the country itself, but rather the opinions of those who govern it, as almost every president who has been impeached faced an immediate surge in popularity from their base and sympathetic non-partisans.  Liberals are trying to avoid empowering him politically.
1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.9.5.
1.8.4. Pro: The proper course is to fight to limit the damage, then strip as much power to disrupt from the presidency without harming the checks and balances system to prevent future anxiety caused by a politically divisive president with a large amount of power.  This can be achieved by legislatively removing much of the war time powers given to the presidency during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, as well as moving the nuclear arsenal into congress's purview, much like the power to declare war.
1.8.5. Pro: Trump's base of support would cause havoc and riot if Trump was impeached, while the liberal left would rejoice. This would create an even greater divide between these two sides of America.
1.8.5.1. Con: Trump's approval rating is so low, that the "riots" you speak of would not be impossible to manage.
1.8.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.2.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Donald Trump rose to prominence as a demagogue for the blue-collar communities of America. If he was impeached, these communities would likely see him as a martyr who stood up for their beliefs.
1.8.5.3. Con: This reasoning is an example of the post hoc fallacy. While an impeachment could possibly be the "tipping point" for such protests, they wouldn't be the cause. That has been fermenting for much longer.
1.8.5.4. Con: It riots and rejoice are the response to each side respectively divide is already great.
1.8.5.5. Pro: This would radicalize each party to form new platforms and disrupt the status quo in Washington
1.8.6. Pro: The debate to impeach Donald Trump is designed to further divide Americans within the bipartisanship.
1.8.7. Con: Politics is, by its nature, divisive.  That's not a reason not to impeach a President.
1.8.7.1. Con: Trumps approval ratings are not an accurate measure of how willing people are to take an action, or what actions they may take.
1.8.7.1.1. Pro: His ratings were negative before the election, but enough people came out to get him elected.
1.8.7.1.2. Pro: A small percentage of the population can still make a impact large enough to cause extreme damage.
1.8.8. Con: Trump's [ability to be a polarizing force](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump) is only enhanced by the fact that he is president. If he were impeached, the Republican party would revert back to being less polarizing, and Trump would just be another internet troll.
1.8.8.1. Con: This is not a "one party" issue when it comes to polarization. Both sides are in the wrong and taking a "my way or the highway" attitude. In addition, the polarizing force started near the middle of bush's second term, and has escalated non stop since then.
1.8.9. Pro: Impeachment proceedings without broad popular support for removing him may just cause entrenchment of "Trumpism".
1.8.9.1. Pro: "Trumpism" should be defeated at the ballot box, not by impeachment. Using a political process rather than an electoral process to defeat an political ideology is authoritarian and not democratic.
1.8.9.1.1. Con: If the president has committed treason or a substantiated impeachable offense, he/she should be impeached. When laws are broken, there are consequences. The rule of law spells out those consequences. Wishing for Trump to only be defeated in a democratic voting process is nothing more than that, wishful thinking for the future \(assuming he has committed an impeachable offense of course\)
1.8.9.2. Pro: The country needs an impeachable offense and a sweeping emotional public sentiment around which to rally in order to defeat Trumpism writ large, not just impeach the man Trump \(on a technicality that may or may not resonate with many Americans\).
1.8.9.3. Pro: Impeaching Trump would only fuel the conspiratorial mindset of his base, making the already divisive presidency far more symbolic, and dangerous.
1.8.9.4. Pro: Clinton's allegedly impeachable offence was easily understood by the masses. Trumps', as of yet, are not.
1.9. Pro: Trump should be impeached on political grounds.
1.9.1. Pro: It is in the Republicans' interest to impeach Trump as this reduces the chances that the Democrats would take power in the next election.
1.9.1.1. Pro: [A poll](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/29/politics/poll-2020-trump-democrats/index.html) revealed that more than half of Americans think Trump will lose in 2020.
1.9.1.2. Pro: [Just 36 percent](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/23/trump-democrats-2020-election-603421) say they would vote to reelect the president in 2020, compared with 44 percent who would pick the Democrat.
1.9.1.3. Con: 20 months in, Trump has more or less the [highest ever](https://qz.com/1295674/donald-trump-now-owns-the-republican-party/) approval ratings in the republican party for a republican President in the modern era during peacetime. Impeaching him would be catastrophic for republican party
1.9.1.3.1. Con: However, he has, [on aggregate from multiple sources](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/), the lowest public approval and highest public disapproval ratings of a sitting president in the last century, with the exception of Truman. This is dangerous for the Republican party from a voting perspective.
1.9.1.3.2. Con: It's unclear how that number \(a majority of a minority of the percentage of Americans who vote\) is affected by the people who have left the Republican party because of Trump, or never joined, or would carry over to the next Republican president.
1.9.1.4. Con: Impeaching someone for political alignment not being with party would not be a legal grounds for impeachment
1.9.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.9.2. Con: Any political malfeasance can be stopped or reversed by the other branches of government. Trump is a President, not a King.
1.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.2.2.
1.9.2.2. Con: The branches of government don't check every action of the President - the President is responsible for a set of duties, and political malfeasance in those duties \(also known as dereliction of duty\) is grounds for impeachment.
1.9.2.2.1. Pro: Impeachment is one way the Congress 'checks' the executive office.
1.9.2.2.2. Con: The other branches can check every action of the executive.  Failing to do so is dereliction of their duty, not the executives.
1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.1.
1.9.4. Con: Impeachment \(with no proof of wrongdoing\) is an attempted shortcut to avoid the electoral process.
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.9.7. Con: Politically, it would be a more impactful social rejection of Donald Trump's movement for him to lose a fair election badly.
1.9.7.1. Con: If he deserves to be impeached, it should be done expeditiously. Waiting for an election could risk him repeating his misdeeds.
1.9.7.2. Con: Given the historical frequency and follow-through of impeachment proceedings, impeaching Trump would have a far greater social and political impact than a landslide loss.
1.9.7.2.1. Con: The most recent president to be impeached, Bill Clinton, enjoyed a [jump in popularity](https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/20/impeachment.poll/) and positive [congressional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_1998) [electoral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2000) results for his party.
1.9.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.2.
1.9.9. Pro: Removal of Trump will help global perception of the US.
1.9.9.1. Con: While this would be politically expedient, it is not a grounds for impeachment.
1.9.9.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.9.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.9.2.
1.9.9.3. Pro: Trump was [booed at the WEF](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/trump-booed-davos-2018-jeered-fake-news-media-speech-us-president-wef-latest-a8179471.html) in Davos.
1.9.9.4. Pro: Trump's "America First" mentality will continue to isolate the US. Allies will regain trust that America is for them.
1.9.9.4.1. Con: Other countries are for themselves, as been shown over the last several years in the policies related funding, trade and resource distribution. The US should not be any different as it would be detrimental to the economy.
1.9.9.4.1.1. Pro: Russia's geopolitical actions slowing the US's countering of NK's nuclear arms and Syria's government actions
1.9.9.4.1.2. Pro: China's continued trading with NK to provide resources which allow for NK's continued arms growth
1.9.9.4.1.3. Pro: EU's continued oil purchases from Syria, countering the US's sanctions
1.9.9.4.2. Pro: President Trump is presenting a picture of a nation that is abandoning its commitments to other nations and seeking only its own wellbeing. He is showing the world a nation that rejects refugees and others in need, even when those populations add great value to our society.
1.9.9.5. Pro: Trump's anti-immigrant stance has been received very negatively abroad, changing the way the world sees America, the supposed 'land of the free'
1.9.9.5.1. Con: Most countries abroad have strict immigration rules of their own. Spain has a double sided fence with barbwire, they beat the people bloody trying to stop them, Libya is selling [captured immigrants](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/world/africa/libya-migrants-slavery.html) as slaves and [most countries](http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-italy-migrants-20170704-htmlstory.html) guard their borders with machine guns.
1.9.9.5.2. Con: Even Europe protects its own borders and are is distracted with an [immigration](http://thefederalist.com/2017/07/18/unable-confront-migrant-crisis-europe-committing-suicide/) [crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/opinion/hungary-is-making-europes-migrant-crisis-worse.html) to even have an opinion on American immigration.
1.9.9.5.2.1. Pro: Many European states [failed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/30/europe-trumps-travel-ban) to criticise Trump's travel ban.
1.9.9.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.9.4.2.
1.9.9.6. Con: Trump is known as a man of strength after his most recent visit to China. He has stood before the UN and stated without shame that the US's top priority is its people. This will only hurt the US' reputation among those who sought to use the US for financial gain of their own.
1.9.9.6.1. Con: "Man of strength' is not an objectively verifiable claim.
1.9.9.6.2. Con: Trump's global reputation as thin-skinned, incompetent, regressive, and dangerous, based on his actions and behaviour throughout his campaign and presidency, was not reversed by something he said at one meeting in China. Many people are not even aware that he said that.
1.9.9.7. Con: Perception of the U.S. on a global level will always be percieved only through the media in which it is permitted, filtered by the owners of that media
1.9.9.7.1. Pro: There is evidence that media outlets are biased in favor of impeachment. They are [misreporting facts and presenting false information](https://gop.com/the-highly-anticipated-2017-fake-news-awards/) about Donald Trump.
1.9.9.7.2. Con: While media plays a large part in foreign perception of the US, tourism another significant factor, which can be extremely difficult for consolidated entities to control.
1.9.9.7.3. Con: Perception of Trump is perceived primarily from recorded video or audio, from his official statements, and from his tweets.
1.9.9.8. Con: The perception of the US globally was formed by previous administrations. Middle East policies for example.
1.9.9.9. Con: To impeach Trump would send a huge message to the world that the USA citizens are uneducated voters AKA "stupid" and that is not what the US need the world to think.
1.9.9.10. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.7.
1.9.9.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.9.6.
1.9.9.12. Con: We cannot sacrifice a democratically elected leader for a popularity contest.
1.9.9.12.1. Con: The Impeachment process is integral to the United States Constitution's separation of powers and put in place for a person like Donald Trump.
1.9.9.12.2. Con: Democratic election is more accurately described as a popularity contest than impeachment.
1.9.10. Pro: Trumps has appointed unfit subordinates who seek to destroy the very agencies they have been appointed to administer, which results in an abuse of power.
1.9.10.1. Con: The President appoints his cabinet and can choose whomever he wants. In some cases it requires Congress to approve the appointees. Some being a "threat" is a subjective point of view.  The President may want to fundamentally change everything, that it his prerogative to proceed as he chooses. Only the next election or Impeachment can change that.
1.9.10.2. Pro: While the president can choose whomever he wants, he must choose someone.  It appears that Trump's lack of appointments may [violate time limits](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/acting-trump-brass-who-ve-stuck-around-too-long-may-draw-rebuke) on enacting appointments.   This inability to faithfully execute the office of president is further grounds for impeachment.
1.10. Pro: Trump should be impeached on ethical and moral grounds, in part for harming the wellbeing of US citizens.
1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.10.2. Pro: Trump's communication encourages [discrimination](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hate-on-the-rise-after-trumps-election) of women and minorities amongst the American population.
1.10.2.1. Con: There is documented evidence of abuse directed towards Trump supporters following the election. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9snWgbVt5w) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJV41gS2c8M) and [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-1j8upKo6Y)
1.10.2.1.1. Con: Abuse towards Trump supporters in no way discredits that Trump's words and actions encourage discrimination.

In fact, since racial tension often lead to violence, it does the opposite.
1.10.2.2. Con: The link cites statistics gathered by the [Southern Poverty Law Center](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/reminder-the-southern-poverty-law-center-is-a-fraud-and-nobody-should-treat-them-as-responsible-actors/article/2631852), a political action group well known for its left leaning bias.
1.10.2.3. Con: There is simply no evidence of an epidemic of abuse towards minorities and women as a result of Trump's election.
1.10.2.4. Pro: According to [FBI data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/03/23/hate-crimes-rose-the-day-after-trump-was-elected-fbi-data-show/?utm_term=.db02185c21bd), hate crimes rose the day after Trump was elected.
1.10.2.5. Pro: Trump was invoked in [20% of hate crimes](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/saalt-hate-crimes-report_us_5a7390fee4b01ce33eb12ae4) against South Asians and Middle Easterners.
1.10.2.6. Pro: There’s a [strong correlation](https://bigthink.com/brandon-weber/dog-whistles-indeed-twitter-encourages-hate-crimes-study-shows) between accounts with high numbers of followers \(such as Trump\) tweeting hate speech and racist remarks, and follow-up violence and hatred in public and even in private settings.
1.10.3. Con: There are no clear examples of Trump placing US Citizens in harm's way or decreasing the well being of US Citizens. Without a clear and distinct act, there is no grounds for impeachment.
1.10.4. Pro: Trump has repeatedly attacked the first amendment to freedom of speech by attacking the free press. This is unconstitutional and worthy of impeachment.
1.10.4.1. Con: President Trump has made no effort to abridge freedom of the press. This is strongly supported by how [negative](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/02/555092743/study-news-coverage-of-trump-more-negative-than-for-other-presidents) his press coverage is.
1.10.4.2. Con: Trump has thrown personal disdain for certain groups he considers fake news but has not made an effort to take away their rights.
1.10.4.3. Con: It would be unconstitutional for Trump to be impeached for exercising his first amendment right to speak his mind and defend himself against a press that frequently attacks him.
1.10.4.3.1. Pro: Furthermore, even if he outright advocated that we censor the press, it would not be unconstitutional, given how even speech like that is protected by the first amendment \(which guards free speech, not some speech\).
1.10.4.4. Pro: Trump's anti-press rhetoric is a means of breaking down the important [democratic role](https://www.thenation.com/article/donald-trumps-attacks-press-attack-democracy/) it plays in keeping the presidential power and authority in check.
1.10.4.5. Pro: [Trump's ban](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/24/media-blocked-white-house-briefing-sean-spicer) of press that is critical of his actions is an infringement on the freedom of speech.
1.10.4.6. Con: Trump's criticism of 'fake news' stories in the media is [entirely justified](https://gop.com/the-highly-anticipated-2017-fake-news-awards/).
1.10.4.6.1. Con: Trump tends to label anything negative about himself as "Fake news", while doing nothing to discourage or attack other sources of fake news. I.E. [Pizzagate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory#Responses)
1.10.5. Pro: Trump's views on immigration are harmful to people.
1.10.5.1. Pro: Trump's [border wall](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37243269) between the US and Mexico will not stop immigration, meaning it is a wasteful use of tax payers' money, which could instead be used more efficiently on other, more pressing citizen needs.
1.10.5.1.1. Con: Wasteful spending and inefficiency are not grounds for impeachment, as they are not in and of themselves high crimes or[misdemeanors](http://www.crf-usa.org/impeachment/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors.html).
1.10.5.1.2. Con: Equally important is the message it sends. Just Trump getting elected alone and talking tough on immigration has resulted in [significant reductions in immigration rates.](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/9/illegal-immigration-southwest-border-down-70-pct/)
1.10.5.1.3. Con: It is debatable on whether or not the wall will be effective.
1.10.5.1.3.1. Pro: Other countries, [like Turkey](http://uk.businessinsider.com/turkey-is-building-a-wall-along-its-border-to-keep-out-isis-militants-2015-7?r=US&IR=T), have walls for national security to combat IS.
1.10.5.1.4. Pro: [Texas smugglers](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/25/texas-smugglers-say-trumps-border-wall-wouldnt-stop-immigrants-drugs-p/) have said that the wall will be ineffective in stopping drugs and immigrants from making it over the border.
1.10.5.1.4.1. Con: The argument relied on by the cited smugglers is that US officials can be bribed. Although no doubt true to an extent, this argument is intrinsically flawed because such bribery can only happen relatively rarely without getting caught. It is totally implausible that there could be enough bribery to allow illegal aliens to flood the border in their current numbers.
1.10.5.1.5. Pro: The wall would do little to stop the [inflow of heroin](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2017/11/13/why-donald-trumps-wall-wont-keep-heroin-out-of-america) into the USA, as most heroin that comes across the Mexican border is transported by vehicle and smuggled through official entry points because it is a low-volume, high-value commodity.
1.10.5.1.5.1. Con: The inflow of heroin is not what the wall is primarily intended to stop.
1.10.5.1.6. Con: [51% of Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/06/27/what-do-americans-think-about-the-wall-the-answers-may-surprise-you-only-if-you-read-drudge/) believe building a wall with Mexico is a good thing, indicating it is a pressing need for citizens and so should be constructed.
1.10.5.1.7. Con: Mexico will ultimately pay for the wall and enjoy it, [according to Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/may/30/mexico-will-pay-for-border-wall-and-enjoy-it-says-trump-video), and so the cost to tax payers will be minimal in the long run.
1.10.5.1.7.1. Con: Trump still has not proposed exactly how Mexico will pay for it and they keep repeatedly denying that they will. Nor is there any evidence that they will "enjoy" it.
1.10.5.2. Pro: Trump's administration is [splitting up families](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-children/exclusive-trump-administration-considering-separating-women-children-at-mexico-border-idUSKBN16A2ES) at the Mexico border, thereby causing immeasurable distress.
1.10.5.2.1. Con: The fault of that distress lies on the illegal aliens themselves for breaking the law, not on the government for enforcing the law.
1.10.5.2.2. Pro: This policy is illegal and is considered a war crime by the UN[Taking Migrant Children From Parents Is Illegal, U.N. Tells U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/world/americas/us-un-migrant-children-families.html)
1.10.5.3. Pro: Trump's [deportation plans](https://www.forbes.com/sites/fernandafabian/2018/03/04/undocumented-entrepreneurs-how-deportations-could-hurt-the-u-s-economy/) could negatively affect US industries.
1.10.5.4. Con: There will always be negative consequences to significant political action.  Trump's action on immigration, particularly illegal immigration will hurt some families but help the country.  Illegal immigration [threatens our democracy](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/did-votes-by-noncitizens-cost-trump-the-2016-popular-vote-sure-looks-that-way/), [places american workers at a disadvantage](https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/at-major-northwest-side-bakery-labor-issues-pit-blacks-vs-hispanics/), and threatens [safety of americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/ms-13-is-taking-over-the-school-one-teen-warned-before-she-was-killed/2018/03/09/93ed7c9c-2083-11e8-86f6-54bfff693d2b_story.html?utm_term=.ef49ad493d46).
1.10.5.5. Con: Trump's views are far less harmful than Obama's indiscriminate killing of people through drone strikes. In one strike, for example, Obama killed [twenty-one children, 10 of whom were under five, and twelve women, five of whom were pregnant.](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush) . Obama did not face impeachment for this, and so it is hypocritical to call for Trump's impeachment for treatment of foreigners breaking US laws that does not involve indiscriminate death.
1.10.6. Con: The Constitution calls for this only for "High crimes and Misdemeanors." Misdemeanors in that context refers to breaches of public trust. No such crime has been proven.
1.10.7. Pro: Trumps [moral character](https://secondnexus.com/news/trump-liquor-license-international-hotel/?utm_content=inf_10_1164_2&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_c908b450b60611e8872dc93302272904) is being called into question by former Judges and several religious leaders for various reasons.
1.10.8. Pro: Trump's tax proposal will further the wealth gap.
1.10.8.1. Con: A wealth gap in and of itself does not reflect that citizens are having their well-being harmed. It is simply a numerical difference between the poorest and richest in a country and not reflective of current or changing [living standards](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/09/how-americans-compare-with-the-global-middle-class/).
1.10.8.2. Con: As an experienced businessman Trump is applying his knowledge to promote a corporation friendly environment in order to keep jobs in the US.
1.10.8.3. Con: Breaking apart the tax proposal, there is no direct benefit to only the wealthy. Some may benefit overall, but given the [caps](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/here-are-the-finalize.html) being implemented, the wealthy "benefit least" out of all wealth groups.
1.10.8.3.1. Pro: interest paid on loans for vacation homes is no longer deductible - surprisingly, this one hits Trump pretty hard given his real estate standings
1.10.8.3.2. Pro: Property, state and local income taxes face a combined $10,000 deduction limit - overwhelmingly hits the high wealth areas with overblown tax rates. specifically, high income land owners in NY and CA that dont qualify for systems like STAR in NY due to income.
1.10.8.3.3. Pro: deduction limit pertaining to mortgage interest drops to $750,000 of debt on your primary residence - overwhelmingly hits people like Trump that are real estate investors with millions in mortgage debt and leverage.
1.10.8.4. Pro: The budget bill proposes cutting [$473 billion](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/22/opinions/trump-tax-cuts-opinion-obeidallah/index.html) Medicare over 10 years, which leaves those who rely on the program to cover their health costs at risk.
1.10.8.5. Con: The tax plan was authored by congressional Republicans. Trump had little to do with it. He probably doesn't really understand it. Any problem with the tax plan needs to be taken up by those who voted to pass it.
1.10.8.6. Con: This is an incorrect assumption. Please note the [wealth gap](https://www.statista.com/statistics/219643/gini-coefficient-for-us-individuals-families-and-households/) changes in the US have had the largest separation in 93 to 95 and 08 to 11. note who was president at those times
1.10.8.7. Pro: Trump's tax plan includes weakening and then eliminating the [federal estate tax](http://fortune.com/2017/11/03/trump-gop-tax-plan-cuts-2017/), which is paid only by America's wealthiest households.
1.10.8.8. Pro: Trump's tax plan drops [corporate tax to 20%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/03/trump-gop-tax-plan-cuts-2017/), which primarily benefits rich corporates.
1.10.8.8.1. Con: Enacting an unpopular policy is not grounds for impeachment.
1.10.8.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.10.8.8.2. Con: Wealth is not a factor in the US tax system as we pay tax based on income. Wealthy typically have a "low" income as the money they make is based off investments.
1.10.8.8.3. Con: US Corporations pay taxes based on income, not wealth. Higher income tax rates hurt startups far more than large wealthy businesses.
1.10.8.8.4. Con: This is a tax to incentivise industry growth, which in turn will trickle down and create jobs for less wealthy classes.
1.10.8.8.4.1. Con: [Corporate tax](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/corporate-tax-cuts-skew-to-shareholders-and-ceos-not-workers-as-administration) cuts skew to benefit shareholders and CEOs, not workers lower-down the chain.
1.10.8.8.4.1.1. Con: This is only true with large publicly traded companies, as in NOT small/medium businesses
examples: [Small Business Tax Impact](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/rs343tot.pdf) , [Tax rate based on income](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/effective-tax-rate-size-income) - taking note that large businesses use carrying debt as a way to hide income. small/medium businesses cannot do that.
1.10.8.8.4.2. Con: "Trickle-down economics" is flawed.  It only works if the extra profits a corporation makes due to lower taxes cause the corporation to pay higher wages, hire more people and lower their prices. Basic corporate theory tells us that a corporation will do none of those things unless they have to, since the golden rule is to maximize shareholder value. Corporations therefore re-invest most extra profits back into the corporation, and the rest are distributed as dividends.
1.10.8.8.4.2.1. Con: Re-investment and increased dividend payouts spur more economic activity, not less.
1.10.8.8.4.3. Pro: Lower corporate taxes will make American companies more competitive and discourage them from moving abroad. This means the companies are able to offer more jobs to American people.
1.10.8.8.4.4. Pro: Trickle down economics is at work right now. [125 companies](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/1023848001) have announced pay raises or bonuses specifically correlating to the adopted tax plan.
1.10.8.8.5. Pro: The non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation within the Congress has shown that the tax bill will accelerate income inequality \(see Distributional Effects report\) [www.jct.gov](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html).  Most of the cuts for those earning under $70k expire whereas they do not for higher earners.  \(compared 2019 to 2027\).  This does not include effects due to loss of healthcare, corporate or estate tax effects which will add to the income disparity.
1.10.9. Pro: Trump's polarising effect is negatively affecting US citizens.
1.10.9.1. Con: Removing any president who causes division is not a feasible political principle. The nature of polarization means that most people will tend to excuse this quality in any President they tend to agree with.
1.10.9.2. Con: Impeaching Trump, particularly if it's perceived to be politically motivated, would increase the polarization of the country.
1.10.9.2.1. Pro: The Trump presidency is a symptom of a broken American government and/or political system. Removing Trump for any reason while allowing that system to remain unchanged would be counterproductive.
1.10.9.2.1.1. Pro: Trump's [inept administrative leadership](https://www.brookings.edu/research/why-is-trumps-staff-turnover-higher-than-the-5-most-recent-presidents/) undermines foundational American institutions, and his divisive politics mobilize [a sizable internal resistance](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/09/resistance-trump-blossoming-movement-la-kaufmann). This may be enough to enable some sort of revolutionary backlash against the American system to succeed.
1.10.9.2.1.1.1. Con: A "revolutionary backlash" should be prevented, as it would likely cause considerable suffering and destruction.
1.10.9.2.1.1.2. Pro: Social psychologists posit "[false uniqueness / false consensus](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-15558-001)" as [keys to maintaining an entrenched social condition that would otherwise be economically or socially untenable](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/Monin_Norton_2003.pdf). This includes everything from simple social taboos to complex repression \(i.e. minority rule, economic exploitation, etc.\). The more vocally aggrieved people there are, the less power these biases have to stymie social change.
1.10.9.2.1.2. Con: The costs of letting the Trump presidency continue are too consequential to justify any potential benefits that might be borne of the crisis. It is unfair to ask the individuals and classes that Trump harms to simply "take one for the team."
1.10.9.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.10.9.2.1.3. Con: Whether it would be subjectively "better" or "worse" has no effect on the process on impeachment.
1.10.9.2.1.3.1. Con: As impeachment is a primarily political institution designed to check the power of the presidency, "better/worse" should be the primary consideration when weighing impeachment.
1.10.9.2.1.3.1.1. Con: This is incorrect. [Impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_4:_Impeachment) is designed to remove all civil officers who are convicted of Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.
1.10.9.2.1.4. Pro: If Trump is a result of a broken system, that system will inevitably give rise to someone else who is as bad or worse.
1.10.9.2.1.5. Pro: Although there may be grounds on which to impeach the president, he should remain in office as it is more important for the US electorate to learn the consequences of voting for someone without due experience.
1.10.9.2.1.5.1. Con: The public should have the power to change its mind.
1.10.9.2.1.5.2. Con: It should be up to the public to define "Due experience."
1.10.9.2.1.6. Con: Trump's actions may send America into a spiraling decline, both at home and abroad, from which no revolutionary backlash, 'lessons learned', or future efforts could recover.
1.10.9.2.1.6.1. Pro: Trump's actions may damage important security and economic relationships with key allies and, during the time of Trump's tenure, these allies are forced to continue making economic and security decisions and relationships.  Trump's tenure at this time may force key allies to move toward other partners and away from America in ways that have permanent impacts on our security and prosperity.
1.10.9.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.5.
1.10.9.2.1.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.9.4.
1.10.9.2.1.6.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.9.5.
1.10.9.2.1.6.2. Pro: Many [scientists](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-08-04/urgent-action-needed-in-light-of-new-climate-change-studies-scientists-say) believe we are within a critical window to address climate change and, as the world's largest per-capita polluter, Trump's failure to take needed action on this issue may result in permanent, irreversible climate impacts.
1.10.9.2.1.6.3. Pro: Experts warn and history shows that democracy is fragile, and Trump critics believe he exhibits [authoritarian](http://www.newsweek.com/harvard-political-science-professor-donald-trump-authoritarian-how-democracy-778425) tendencies.  If Trump undermines democratic processes and institutions, rule of law, and public expectations, America may plunge into authoritarian control, of which it may take centuries to recover from if we ever do.
1.10.9.2.1.7. Pro: Impeaching Donald Trump undermines the power foundations of those who supported him.
1.10.9.2.1.7.1. Con: If impeaching Trump becomes the will of the majority of the American public as expressed by its elected representatives, our system dictates that Trump supporters' wishes should be overruled.
1.10.9.2.1.7.1.1. Con: Contrary to the above claim, our system does not dictate the [Tyranny of the Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority) outlined above.  Our system was established with safeguards against such abuses.
1.10.9.2.1.7.1.1.1. Con: [Impeachment was established as a systemic check on the Presidency in the original text of the Constitution.](http://constitutionus.com/#a1s2c5) Carrying out that procedure as designed can hardly be considered an abuse. Rather it is the system working as it was intended.
1.10.9.2.1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: The preceding claims that "Trump should be impeach if it becomes the will of the majority" are not attempts to follow the Impeachment process as designed.  Applying it for purposes other than those enumerated \(Treason, bribery, crimes\) is a clear abuse of power.
1.10.9.2.1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.10.9.2.1.7.2. Pro: Many within the Republican party who supported Trump will suffer when the president is impeached.
1.10.9.2.1.7.2.1. Con: The Republican Party chose Trump.  He is what they wanted.  If he is bad for them, then they should reap what they have sown, politically-speaking.
1.10.9.2.1.7.2.2. Pro: The impeachment of a Republican president would permanently tarnish their reputation.
1.10.9.2.1.7.2.3. Con: Impeaching Trump would be politically expedient for the Republicans.
1.10.9.2.1.7.3. Pro: Impeaching Trump without any evidence of illegal activities would only prove to his supporters that their opinions and vote doesn't matter, further dividing the nation
1.10.9.2.1.7.3.1. Con: Not impeaching Trump tells his voters that their candidate and our president can get away with impeachable offenses just because we are worried they might feel like their vote and opinions don't matter.  We should choose law and order over opinions and bad votes.
1.10.9.2.1.7.4. Pro: He was democratically elected and many Americans still support him.
1.10.9.2.1.7.4.1. Con: Both the Republican party and the Democrats have lost confidence in the president’s ability to govern.
1.10.9.2.1.7.4.2. Con: Although he was elected, he did not win the popular vote.
1.10.9.2.1.7.4.2.1. Con: The popular vote is not currently, nor ever has been, the way the USA has elected a president.
1.10.9.2.1.7.4.3. Con: Neither of these conditions historically precludes impeachment.
1.10.9.2.1.7.4.3.1. Pro: None of the other things Trump has done has been historically used to impeach a President.
1.10.9.2.1.7.4.3.1.1. Con: As [only two Presidents](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/presidential-impeachment-usa-often-has-happened/) have ever been impeached, binding historical precedent has not been established.
1.10.9.2.1.7.4.4. Pro: Given his impeachment is debatable at present, impeaching Trump now could rupture the American democracy, which is one of the few in the world which is stable after centuries.
1.10.9.2.1.7.4.4.1. Con: This argument makes the assumption that Trump has not committed any crimes to justify impeachment.
1.10.9.2.1.7.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.2.
1.10.9.2.1.7.5. Con: Impeachment is not an act of subversion.  It's every bit as legal, valid, and constitutional as the Electoral College.
1.10.9.2.1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.10.9.2.1.5.
1.10.9.2.1.7.7. Con: The Republican voters would not be undermined should the President be impeached; seeing as the Republican Party's ideology will stand as the ambitions for the still-GOP presidency.
1.10.9.2.1.7.7.1. Con: This assumes a blind tribalism among all Trump voters, many of whom were independent or voted for Trump because he did not campaign as a traditional Republican. Trump clearly delineated himself as something different than the status quo.
1.10.9.2.1.7.7.1.1. Con: Given their continued support in the face of a [mess of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSE-XoVKaXg) [self-contradictions](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/01/ranked-donald-trumps-foreign-policy-contradictions/513635/) in Trump's [public policy actions](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-denies-reached-daca-deal-democrats-article-1.3495117) and [stances](https://www.elitedaily.com/news/politics/much-needed-reddit-finds-trumps-contradictory-tweets-dont/1955264), it is reasonable to conclude that committed Trump supporters could only be blind adherents to a cult of personality.
1.10.9.2.1.7.8. Con: -> See 1.9.9.12.
1.10.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.9.5.
1.10.9.4. Con: The act of polarizing requires two entities with opposing interests. In this case, two political parties. These parties have always been at odds. Trump is not the polarizing factor, politics are.
1.10.9.5. Con: You can not blame Donald Trump for how people choose to respond - or in many cases unthinkingly react - to what he says or does.
1.10.9.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.9.5.8.
1.10.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.9.
1.10.11. Con: The President must commit a violation of a federal law in order to be impeached and this is not a federal crime.
1.10.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.11. Con: The alternative to a Trump presidency is worse than having him in power.
1.11.1. Con: -> See 1.10.9.2.1.3.
1.11.2. Pro: Leaving Trump in place gridlocks the system. With the current congress held by Republicans, political gridlock stops the legislature from passing more extreme laws.
1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.9.2.
