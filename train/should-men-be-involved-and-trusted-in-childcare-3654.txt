Discussion Title: Should Men Be Involved And Trusted In Childcare?

1. Men should be involved and trusted in childcare.
1.1. Con: Some parents are too paranoid to allow this to happen.
1.1.1. Con: America has, actually, become [much safer](https://www.hg.org/article.asp?id=32164) in recent years.
1.1.2. Pro: Some parents are uncomfortable with the idea of a man working with children.
1.1.2.1. Con: That's because of the media's [constant coverage](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/12/us/pennsylvanias-sandusky-appeal/index.html) of and attention on child abuse perpetrators.
1.1.2.2. Con: Perpetrators of child abuse are [way more likely](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/somatic-psychology/201105/who-are-the-perpetrators-child-abuse) to be the child's parents.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: The parents are around them most of the time, though.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The media makes it seem like the parents are the safest, though.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: Or the [unmarried partner](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/somatic-psychology/201105/who-are-the-perpetrators-child-abuse) of the child's parent.
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: Mostly [the mothers](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/somatic-psychology/201105/who-are-the-perpetrators-child-abuse), too.
1.1.2.3. Con: Prejudice is never justification to discriminate
1.1.3. Con: Paranoia breeds paranoia and infuses a sense of self distrust in other people, furthering the gap.
1.1.4. Con: This is an explanation for why it happens, not a reason why it should happen.
1.2. Pro: Stigmatizing an entire gender because of the perpetations of a few individuals is sexist and bigoted and has little connection with reality.
1.2.1. Pro: We cannot and should not allow the criminals to have this much control over our lives.
1.2.2. Pro: By setting a precedent of only female caretakers, we are enabling the stereotype of the dumb dad, the deadbeat dad, and the mother who has sole responsibility for the household.
1.2.3. Pro: Plenty of female caretakers have taken of advantage of boys in their care or physically abused them. Just like women should be encouraged to enter male dominated fields, men should be encouraged to enter female dominated ones. Distrusting someone based on gender is sexist.
1.2.3.1. Con: Hypocritically, when women sexually abuse boys it's "nice"; incorrect though it is, that is what some people think.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Not all people believe this, and there is a growing understanding for the inherent sexism in de-legitimising sexual abuse towards males.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Indeed, female paedophiles are [more prevalent](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-28/female-paedophiles-prevalent-says-leading-forensic-psychologist/6428710) than most people realise.
1.2.4. Pro: Continuing the norm \(women as caregivers, nurturers, etc.\) perpetuates people identifying women as the only ones suited to this role, and pigeonholing women automatically into the role of nurturer and caregiver. This perpetuates gender inequality. Integrating men into childcare would foster a more egalitarian society.
1.2.5. Con: The statistics speak for themselves: [nearly 90%](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/newcastle-grooming-scandal-exploitation-victims-sarah-champion-race-a7890106.html) of convicted child sex offenders are white men. It is more of a statistical risk to allow them a large role in childcare.
1.2.5.1. Con: 85% of Munchausen by Proxy cases involve mothers abusing their children [\(source\)](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/munchausen.html). Therefore, the same guilty-by-risk reasoning would support banning mothers from raising children.
1.3. Pro: All childcare should be subject to rigorous checks and controls to ensure the safety of the children. With these in place gender is no longer an issue.
1.3.1. Pro: It's discriminatory to suggest that males simply because of their gender are immediately to be suspected of heinous intent.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.3.3. Pro: The media has ruined childcare for men.
1.3.3.1. Pro: If you watch the media all the time, they make it seem like the world is much worse than it is.
1.3.4. Pro: Absolutely. Everybody should be free to pursue whatever career or calling they wish, without discrimination. Childcare and education providers are required to have rigorous procedures that safeguard children, so safety is no longer an issue. Many men are wonderful with children and increasingly men take more of an equal share in raising their own children and find they love it.
1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.2.5.
1.4. Pro: Men are [great role models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a8fvbkNLWQ), energetic, and understanding of the needs of boys.
1.4.1. Pro: It is very important to build relationships when dealing with children.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Children will respond better if you have a good relationship with them.
1.4.2. Con: Women can also be energetic, and understanding of the needs of boys.
1.4.3. Pro: Boys need men in their lives, other than their fathers.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Having strong, positive [role models](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/nov/11/school-role-models) at home and school helps children with their sense of self, self-esteem and growth.
1.4.4. Con: Women can also be great role models.
1.5. Con: Wages for traditionally-male jobs \(not childcare\) are biased in favor of men, so men should generally take those jobs instead of childcare.
1.5.1. Con: Money is not a good reason to get into any specific field.
1.5.1.1. Con: Although that would be a preferred belief, our system often pushes people into fields they feel will best provide for them, even if it negatively affects their career happiness.
1.5.2. Con: Everyone should be free to choose their occupation, regardless of wage or salary.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.7. Con: Men are generally worse at taking care of children than women.
1.7.1. Pro: When they’re young, men don’t get as much training in childcare as women because of traditional gender roles.
1.7.1.1. Con: Through formal education and on-the-job training, men can learn about childcare later in life.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Because children's' brains are far more malleable than that of an adult, children, both boys and girls, should be taught essential life lessons at the earliest possible age.
1.7.1.2. Pro: By allowing young men to get guided experience working with children, we can help raise men who are more equipped and trusted to handle childcare, which will lead to a change in the stigma.
1.7.2. Con: Men are good at playing with children.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Men are stronger than women
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Men can wrestle with boys
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Boys can "climb" on men much easier
1.7.2.1.3. Pro: Men generally have wider frames than women, so they can give more simultaneous piggy-back rides.
1.7.2.1.4. Con: This has no bearing on their childcare abilities.
1.7.2.2. Con: There is more to child care than playing.
1.7.3. Con: Some women aren't very good at taking care of children either.
1.7.4. Con: There is no established metric for determining who is "good" or "bad" at taking care of children.
1.7.5. Con: It depends on the person, not the sex.
1.8. Con: Men are more likely to [maltreat](http://www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/176/567) children.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.9. Pro: Given the current number of single mums \(single dads exist but are relatively rare - the proportion of single parents who are fathers in the UK has stayed at around 10 per cent for over ten years according to ONS \(2017\) Families and households, 2017\). A male role model would probably be a good thing for lots of girls and boys.
