Discussion Title: Should people be free to choose the country in which they live?

1. Should people be free to choose the country in which they live?
1.1. Con: Receiving countries and their citizens should have the possibility to say 'no' to a prospective immigrant.
1.2. Pro: Integration of cultures is beneficial to all concerned.
1.2.1. Pro: Immigrants bring valuable perspectives and ideas to their new communities.
1.2.2. Con: Culturally distinct newcomers often do not integrate, and instead keep to separate sub-cultures.
1.2.2.1. Pro: A multicultural society will not necessarily integrate, unless all sides see value in the others.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Cultures do not integrate with one another. There is not a seamless merging of ideas when one culture encounters another. Generally speaking one culture will subsume the other culture keeping only the parts that the larger culture likes in the smaller culture. 

Which culture "wins" is not always reflective of which culture is most generous, kind and protective of human rights.
1.2.3. Pro: As long as immigrants benefit the country they chose. If it was mandatory for them to participate in social projects, they would not only integrate faster but also create empathy and understanding for their situation and home they fled from.
1.2.4. Con: A good chef understands the value of regional cuisine and pure traditional culture preserved by a homogenous people.
1.2.5. Con: Integration results in the diminishing of certain cultures.
1.2.6. Pro: Intergration of cultures results in more understanding and empathy, effectively destroying biases.
1.2.6.1. Con: When people have the choice, they move to neighborhoods of their own ethnic group. For example, self-segregation is still going on between blacks and whites in the U.S. in spite of growing up in the same culture, and migrants to Europe in the last decades have concentrated in small areas where they largely stay among themselves instead of integrating in the larger society.
1.2.7. Con: [On the contrary](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2007.00176.x), ethnic heterogeneity leads to multiple problems: reduced trust in and contact with neighbors, reduced community cooperation and altruism.
1.3. Pro: People should have a right to live and work with others who share their values, so they are not marginalized or discriminated against.
1.3.1. Con: Nobody can have a right to association, because that would contradict freedom of association.
1.4. Con: Mass migration can be [a threat](https://www.channelstv.com/2018/01/17/trump-warns-immigration-threat-national-security/) to national security.
1.4.1. Pro: Freedom of movement makes it easier for people intending to damage a country to get in.
1.4.1.1. Con: If border controls and checks are scaled up with the increase of migration, this can be negated.
1.4.2. Con: Freedom to choose your country is not absolute, so reasonable restrictions can be placed upon it.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Freedom to choose your country would be a Positive Right \( eg right to [Education](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_education) or [Health](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_health)\), and these positive rights all have appropriate restrictions. This is opposed to an negative right \(eg Right to Freedom from slavery / Torture\) which is absolute, and should be strictly applied.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Restricting dangerous individuals from accessing a positive right is acceptable.
Freedom of movement could therefore be restricted for dangerous or criminal persons.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Positive rights can be limited if a country is unable to fully provide them. For example, many countries set age limits for free public education, to ensure it can exist sustainably. Freedom of movement could be similarly limited as necessary to ensure its existence.
1.4.3. Con: National borders are obsolete in the era of globalization.
1.5. Con: Allowing free immigration poses a question around how immigrants contribute before benefiting from others' investment.
1.5.1. Con: Newborns, children, and people with disabilities do not contribute immediately to society either. Therefore we don't necessarily have to contribute to benefit from the good side effects of others investments.
1.5.2. Con: Past investments were made to defend a minority of people, while new investments should help people to freely move across borders.
1.5.3. Con: It poses a question that can and should be answered: a country can have its own protective policy to minimize the risk of its investments being eroded even with immigrants inside.
1.5.4. Con: Restrictions could still easily apply, for example migrants can only stay if they are working or self-sufficient.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The EU is an example of freedom of movement which is [restricted](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/what-eu-freedom-movement) to those who can pay their taxes.
1.5.5. Con: Most migrants would start contributing as well upon their arrival, it shouldn't matter that they started contributing later than native born citizens.
1.5.5.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that in the absence of any immigration restrictions only people who can and will contribute would come.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Even with immigration restrictions, current migration from the Third to the First World is already a net loss for host countries, because the people coming often have nothing to offer but unskilled labor, and need additional resources for language and job training in order to contribute anything, while being eligible for government assistance.
1.5.5.1.1.1. Con: Studies show that immigration benefits destination countries. At least, that is the case in [France](https://journals.openedition.org/e-migrinter/385).
1.5.5.1.1.1.1. Con: This report is about all immigration, and does not distinguish between countries of origin. Even so, the net contribution of immigrants is lower on average than that of the native population \(fig. 3\) - and this is only an average. Typically, immigrants from other First-World countries are a net benefit, whereas Third-World immigrants are a loss.
1.5.5.1.1.2. Con: Abuse of welfare it is generally perceived as way bigger than it actually is.
1.5.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Fraud actually represents the [2.1%](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/may/13/welfare-fraud-error-universal-credit) of the overall benefit expenditure. From that, only 0.7% id due to actual fraud, while the rest  is due to claimant errors \(0.9%\) and to officials errors \(0.5%\).
1.5.5.1.1.2.2. Pro: While the British public thinks that around 27% of welfare Budget is lost to fraud, the levels are [way lower](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/may/13/welfare-fraud-error-universal-credit) and are out weighted by errors from citizens and officials alike.
1.5.5.1.1.3. Con: [Data](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/immigration-uk-economy-what-are-the-benefits-stats-theresa-may-amber-rudd-tory-conference-speeches-a7346121.html) in the UK contradicts that immigrants are not productive or consume more resources than contribute to the economy.
1.5.5.1.1.3.1. Con: As the chart shows, immigrants from the EU have a slightly higher employment rate than natives, while that of immigrants from the rest of the world is significantly lower. This is hardly surprising, as EU citizens \(and people from the rest of the First World\) will mostly migrate for career opportunities, often in high-income jobs, whereas immigrants from the Third World often have little to offer but unskilled labor, and have an improved standard of living even when on welfare.
1.5.5.1.1.4. Pro: In Germany, [43,1%](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article166743394/Jeder-zweite-Arbeitslose-in-Westdeutschland-hat-Migrationshintergrund.html) of all recipients of unemployment benefits are migrants or have at least one immigrant parent, while only being [22,5%](https://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/zahlen-und-fakten/soziale-situation-in-deutschland/61646/migrationshintergrund-i) of the population.
1.5.5.1.1.5. Pro: Migrants coming to Europe in the 2015 'refugee crisis' predominantly chose Germany, where they are eligible for the [same government benefits as citizens](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/fluechtlinge-in-europa-asylrecht-der-ziellaender-im-vergleich-a-1053345.html) as soon as they are granted refugee status, and can bring their families.
1.5.5.1.1.6. Pro: If the masses of refugees were perceived as net benefit, countries would be fighting over who gets them, not about who must take them, and the EU would not be paying Turkey to keep them, but to send them on their way.
1.5.5.2. Pro: As unaccompanied minors are a fraction of the migrant percentage, major investments to the making of a citizen are already made \(like cost of baby delivery, childcare, early years education and health and university costs\). Hosting countries can profit from the start.
1.5.5.3. Pro: Immigration can be economically beneficial.
1.5.5.3.1. Con: It's only beneficial if it is controlled. In case of free movement, the receiving countries' safety nets will collapse under the pressure. Also, mass immigration lowers the wages for low-earning jobs.
1.5.5.3.2. Pro: [Economist](https://wol.iza.org/articles/freedom-of-movement-for-workers/long) suggests that open borders could [increase](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/klaus-zimmermann/what-if-there-were-no-nat_b_7917800.html) the world's GDP substantially.
1.5.5.3.2.1. Pro: The [OECD](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/international-migration-outlook-2013_migr_outlook-2013-en) found that migration in the UK contributed +0.46% of GDP.
1.5.5.3.2.2. Con: The IZA paper uses notoriously unreliable economic models to make a case for free movement of workers.
1.5.5.3.2.2.1. Pro: The paper rests on the assumption that workers from less developed countries can become instantly as productive as the host country's workers.
1.5.5.3.2.2.2. Pro: The paper completely ignores the cost of migration: welfare programs, which immigrants tend to rely on disproportionately, and additional cost for infrastructure due to the increased number of people.
1.5.5.3.2.3. Con: The IZA paper points out the benefits for immigrants, not for the host economy. For native workers, it predicts that wages are unaffected.
1.5.5.3.3. Con: Increased applications for migration will add a huge administrative cost.
1.5.5.3.4. Pro: The European Union \(EU\) successfully [has Freedom of Movement](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/41/free-movement-of-workers) as part of it's [Single Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Single_Market).
1.5.5.3.4.1. Pro: There is no reason that this Free movement zone could not scale up to cover more countries.
1.5.5.3.4.2. Pro: The Single market [increased](https://www.kommers.se/Documents/dokumentarkiv/publikationer/2015/Publ-economic-effects-of-the-european-single-market.pdf) EU GDP.
1.5.5.3.4.3. Con: EU Freedom of movement is [often limited](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/what-eu-freedom-movement) \(or applies restrictions\) for those who are not contributing economically \(ie not working\). Therefore it is not a full example of Open Borders/Freedom of Movement.
1.5.5.3.4.4. Pro: The OECD estimated that European Union \(EU\) freedom of movement has lowered the average unemployment rate across Europe by [up to 6%](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/free-movement-of-workers-and-labour-market-adjustment_9789264177185-en#page1).
1.5.5.3.4.5. Con: Brexit shows that [many do not like](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/01/why-its-time-end-eu-free-movement) Freedom of Movement.
1.5.5.3.5. Pro: Migrants and asylum seekers can benefit the economies of their host nations. As shown in the data analysis of 30 years of data from 15 countries in Western Europe, migrants [positively affect the economy within a year of arrival](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/6/eaaq0883), continuing to have significant impact for 2+ years. Asylum seekers have a significant impact after 3-7 years since arrival, but it is not as strong an impact as that of other migrant groups.
1.5.5.3.6. Pro: An American [20 year study](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=23550) found that over the long term, the impacts of immigrants on government budgets are generally positive at the federal level.
1.5.5.3.7. Con: A [report](https://www.ippr.org/files/images/media/files/publication/2011/05/Paying%20Their%20Way_1352.pdf?noredirect=1) from the Institute for Public Policy Research \(IPPR\) in 2005 found that expenditure attributed to immigrants grew by more than the revenue from them, resulting in a negative impact of -£0.4 billion in 2003-4.
1.5.5.3.7.1. Con: During this time period the report found that the UK born population also had a negative fiscal impact, and their [impact was higher](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/) than the immigrant impact.
1.5.5.3.8. Con: [MigrationWatch UK studies show](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefing-paper/7) that depending on how you account for dependent children or the elderly, migrants give a negative net contribution.
1.5.5.3.8.1. Pro: A Migration Watch UK [paper](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefing-paper/381) looking at the 2014/15 period found that if you look at the Working Age population only, the UK-born population was the only group that \(out of EEA, Non-EEA, UK Born\) [did make a positive fiscal contribution](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/).
1.5.5.3.8.1.1. Con: It is fairer to look at the whole age range than a narrow one, as increases in dependents/the elderly has a significant effect, and all effects of migration should be considered.
1.5.5.3.8.2. Pro: If costs from children born to one immigrant and one UK-born parent are [shared between both categories](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/), MigrationWatch estimates show that the net fiscal impact of immigrants was negative \(-£1 billion for 1999-2000 and -£5 billion for 2003-2004\).
1.5.5.3.8.2.1. Con: These UK born children should count as fully UK born, not half immigrant, because they are UK citizens.
1.5.5.3.8.2.2. Pro: Alternative estimates allocating all children of mixed couples to the immigrant group show the fiscal cost of migrants to be [much higher](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/) \(around -£3.8 billion in 1999-2000\).
1.5.5.3.9. Pro: In 2013 the UKs Office for Budget Responsibility \(OBR\) predicted that in the long term \(50 years\) higher net immigration would [reduce pressure on government debt](http://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/2013-FSR_OBR_web.pdf).
1.5.5.3.10. Pro: Researchers generally agree that recent immigrants are, as groups, [more likely to have a positive net fiscal impact](https://fullfact.org/immigration/how-immigrants-affect-public-finances/).
1.5.5.3.11. Pro: In the US, is is reported that even refugees can represent economic and financial [benefits](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/refugees-may-be-good-for-the-economy/): they pay $20,000 more than they receive in benefits.
1.5.5.3.11.1. Pro: This part of the study only looked at adults \(18-45\). If children were taken into account, the net gain over 20 years would be much higher, as the study shows child refugees attain better economic outcomes than adults.
1.5.5.3.11.1.1. Pro: A 20 year US study [found no difference](http://www.nber.org/digest/aug17/w23498.shtml) in economic outcomes between refugees who arrived as children and U.S.-born citizens.
1.5.5.3.11.2. Con: The underlying source only takes into account direct financial aid, completely ignoring added infrastructure costs for schools, health care, public transportation etc.
1.5.5.3.11.3. Con: Refugees in the U.S. are not a representative sample of potential immigrants.
1.5.6. Pro: The existing residents of a country will have invested in its social wealth through taxation, sometimes over many years.
1.6. Pro: Nations are social constructs and not absolute truths, so the existence of borders is something politically questionable.
1.6.1. Pro: People should be able to live where they want, under the simple condition that they try to be a benefit to the place where they want to live.
1.6.2. Con: Geographical borders between different social/ethnic groups have always existed. Borders on maps are a recent phenomenon, but different groups have always physically separated themselves.
1.6.3. Con: A country is a survival organism, and it's border has both cultural and economical meaning.
1.6.4. Con: The assumption of the existence of absolute truths can output any possible sentence. The existence of country borders is as real as the borders between pros and cons in Kialo.
1.6.5. Pro: Borders are arbitarary constructs, often a product of wars which took place centuries ago, other times with reasons which are no longer valid or without any justification at all.
1.6.5.1. Con: Regardless of the way current borders formed, they now separate different distinct cultures. This makes them now well defined, meaningful, and no longer arbitrary.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Borders between countries may be less important than non-geographic cultures, which can be national or international due to globalisation and the internet.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: [LGBT Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_culture) is not tied to any geographical area and is a very impactful culture, bringing improved rights, inclusion, and acceptance.
1.6.5.2.2. Pro: Due to modern media, there is no need for immigration in order to exchange ideas and challenge cultural norms in other countries.
1.6.5.2.2.1. Con: There are many ways that [face to face interactions are more impactful](https://www.fastcompany.com/3051518/the-science-of-when-you-need-in-person-communication) than internet interactions. This suggests that cultural exchange may be increased when cultures are physically near each other, when compared to internet/media based exposure.
1.6.6. Con: The fact that different peoples have created different and easily distinguishable countries clearly demonstrates that we are not "all one". A country is much more than just a territory or a political system: its people have a shared heritage and history that shaped the country and its success \(or lack thereof\). Letting people settle who have no intention to adopt the host country's culture as their own dilutes the culture and diminishes the diversity of human nations.
1.6.7. Con: The existence of borders is fundamental to preserving the security of a country.
1.6.7.1. Con: The huge amounts of money dedicated to controlling borders and keeping people out could be used to more policing to make citizens safer.
1.6.7.1.1. Con: Given that the border is a much smaller area to police than the whole country, it is obvious that keeping bad people out is much more efficient than trying to catch them once they are inside.
1.6.7.1.1.1. Pro: This is also the reason why building security focuses on not letting people in who have no business being there, instead of monitoring the whole building, and only acting when somebody is caught doing something they are not supposed to do.
1.6.8. Pro: As John Lennon put it, you can imagine a world without borders where everyone lives in peace.
1.6.8.1. Con: I cannot actually imagine this. Imagine living in a ghetto without a door you can lock.
1.6.8.2. Con: This is poetic, but it is unrealistic and dangerous.
1.6.9. Pro: Countries in which we are born are like a lottery. There is no reason why people have the right to remain where they were born since it was a random accident.
1.6.9.1. Con: There is no lottery of birth. Every individual is a product of his parents' genes and the environment into which he is born, not a well-defined entity that is randomly assigned to a woman's womb. Every one of us is only here because our ancestors successfully reproduced, and inherits his starting position from that unbroken line of ancestry that goes back to the beginning of life on earth. We are individuals, but we are also links in a chain of reproduction and inheritance.
1.6.10. Pro: On the higher lever we are all one. Humans have created all these Countries, States, Boundaries, Castes, Religions, etc. Let every human being live their best possible life as required and as best fit for them.
1.6.10.1. Con: -> See 1.6.6.
1.7. Con: It would require a whole system of regulations, laws, legislations and a general change of goverment.
1.7.1. Con: While this affects how hard it is to implement, it doesn't affect if it is the right thing to do. Many worthwhile actions in human history have required these things, for example ending slavery or religious/patriarchal rule.
1.8. Con: NO! If that was allowed, there would be massive over-crowding in certain regions of the world. Each nation should have a screening process to deny entry to foreigners who have contagious diseases, violent, political ideologies, past criminal offenses, etc. And they should also be sure that immigrants have some meaningful goals: education goals, career goals, or some kind of goal that will contribute something of value to others INSTEAD OF GETTING ON WELFARE.
1.9. Con: Free migration does not work well when migration flows go to socialist or welfare-heavy countries. Those who work end up supporting a greater population of unemployed people and the country becomes poorer as a result.
1.10. Pro: Freedom should be the default. People who are against freedom in any instance have to show how they are right.
1.10.1. Con: Even if the state was abolished, there would still be borders, because private property borders are enforceable. While there would be no state territory to enter, entering an area would still require the permission of the owners. In a conflict between the will of the individual who wants to enter and the will of the land owner to wants to deny entry, the latter prevails.
1.10.1.1. Con: [Trespass laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass_to_land) already protect land owners from unwanted intruders, and are not mutually exclusive with open borders at a country level.
1.10.1.2. Con: There is no reason to abolish the state, or to abolish country level borders, to give everyone the freedom to choose which country to live in.
1.11. Con: Some countries are more attractive and with better prospects than others. Free movement could result in some countries being over-populated and thus worsen financially.
1.11.1. Con: It doesn't look like people migrate because life is better elsewhere, but just because life is not possible where they are born. Free immigration would not necessarily result in a lot of more immigration just because some countries are more attractive than others.
1.11.2. Con: And then according to the theory people of the newly overpopulated countries could migrate back. An equilibrium will thus be found.
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.11.4. Con: -> See 1.5.5.3.
1.11.5. Pro: Not all countries in the world are attractive places for human beings in terms of the [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index).
1.11.6. Pro: Since overpopulation and resource saturation, we almost live in a zero-sum economy. This means that you have to compete for resources. A country is like a unit competitor.
1.11.6.1. Con: The economy is still positive-sum, and people in the Third World are lifted out of absolute poverty at record rates, while First World countries still create new wealth.
1.11.7. Pro: We already see in current migration patterns that immigration to rich/developed countries from the rest of the world is [much higher](http://www.global-migration.info/) than the other way around.
1.11.8. Con: It is impossible to predict what future movement fluxes while be. However, available data does not support massive migrations.
1.11.8.1. Pro: In EU, where there is freedom of movement and relative inequality among countries, only [3.8%](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_citizens_living_in_another_Member_State_-_statistical_overview) of EU-born citizens of working age were living in another member state in 2017.
1.11.8.1.1. Pro: Additionally, many European states with bigger [populations](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Share_of_non-nationals_in_the_resident_population,_1_January_2016_\(%25\).png) of citizen from other EU states or abroad are [economically](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:Share_of_non-nationals_in_the_resident_population,_1_January_2016_\(%25\).png) stronger.
1.11.8.1.1.1. Con: That is not a good indicator. Those countries may be economically stronger per se and thus attract more immigration, not be economically stronger thanks to immigration.
1.11.8.1.2. Con: The EU has strict rules against internal welfare shopping, so only productive workers can migrate to another country. These people are often not motivated enough to move, because of the language barriers and little improvement to their standard of living.
1.11.8.2. Pro: About [97% of the world population](https://books.google.es/books?id=OvfsBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT95&lpg=PT95&dq=\(97%25+of+the+world%E2%80%99s+population+remain+in+the+countries+where+they+were+born&source=bl&ots=xr_0V9rnjW&sig=o3x45ROWm7iLqLdFpLMoV3Ab8FY&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNtZbwwJncAhVLPRQKHZzvAGYQ6AEIRTAE#v=onepage&q=97%25%20&f=false) live in the same country they were born, and that percentage ration has been steady since [1900](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/klaus-zimmermann/what-if-there-were-no-nat_b_7917800.html).
1.11.8.2.1. Con: This is the way it is precisely because there are no open borders, or only among countries of relatively similar wealth. If people already cross borders illegally, removing all restrictions and threats of punishment would certainly increase the number of migrants.
1.12. Con: A country's identity and culture may be eroded by massive migrations.
1.12.1. Con: This is not necessarily bad. Immigrants bring an outside view on existing bad cultural practices, which may lead to better ways to do things.
1.12.1.1. Pro: Chinese culture was hugely infulened and driven by foot binding, a voluntary mutilation of female feet, an immensely painful process leading to inability to walk. It affected all levels of Chinese culture, contributed to male dominance, changed sexual norms, stunted exploration, and even infulened architecture/city planning. Because chinese culture was isolated from external Infulences, this practice [continued for a thousand years](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-footbinding-persisted-china-millennium-180953971/).
1.12.1.2. Con: Immigrants criticizing the host country's culture can be easily dismissed based on the fact that they chose to come and can go back if the do not like it.
1.12.1.3. Con: In order to enact social change, one has to be an opinion leader, i.e. have status and influence. Immigrants typically start with low social status, because they are outsiders.
1.12.1.4. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.2.
1.12.2. Pro: Ideally, people would live in societies where they fit in. If one believes in American values, they should move to the US and those values wouldn't be threatened. In reality, however, people migrate for economic reasons which can destroy a country's cohesion.
1.12.3. Con: -> See 1.6.5.2.
1.12.4. Pro: There are relations of belonging and identity, such as language and cultural habits, which must be preserved and may be not totally compatible with multiculturalism.
1.12.4.1. Con: Culture just evolves, and it should never be an argument against the price of the life of an immigrant.
1.12.4.2. Con: They are absolutely compatible. London has an immensely high immigrant population. Does this mean London has no language or no culture? More languages =/= No languages; More culture =/= No culture.
1.12.4.3. Pro: Disrespect for the values of countries hosting immigrants is proof that multiculturalism does not work.
1.12.4.3.1. Con: Resentment of the host country is usually founded in resentment of the host country's religious beliefs.
1.12.4.4. Pro: Immigrants are often intolerant and wish to impose their culture on the host countries.
1.12.4.4.1. Con: Probably there are some, but it has hardly ever been successful, except in cases of literal invading armies, which shouldn't be considered immigration. Hence, there is nothing to worry about.
1.12.4.5. Pro: Multiculturalism can be a contributing factor in terrorism.
1.12.4.5.1. Con: Terrorism is not a function of multiculturalism by any stretch of the imagination. It is about religion, politics, economics, and other things.
1.13. Pro: If we accept a liberal view, property rights, liberty, and life precede the existence and power of the state. Thus, the will of the individual exists before the existence of the borders.
1.13.1. Con: By accepting the liberal view, as John Locke put it, we end up consenting to a state. Now the state to exist implies a territory and one of its most basic functions is to defend the freedom and property of its citizens against potential dangers.
1.13.1.1. Con: People wanting to live in a country and contribute are not a potential danger.
