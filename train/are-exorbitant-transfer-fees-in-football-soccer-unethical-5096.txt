1.4. Pro: Poorer clubs benefit when they sell players on for fees.
1.5. Con: Transfer fees for footballers are perverse in a world full of poverty

1.9. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.10. Pro: They fees paid are determined by the market. If a club is willing to spend Â£X million on a player then it is because both parties are happy that this deal is fair. In this sense it is as ethical as much as market economics is ethical.
1.11. Con: Putting a monetary price on humans is unethical.
1.11.1. Con: The transfer fee is compensation for ending a contract early; factors affecting the fee include how long the contract had left to run. It's therefore not correct to term this purely as a value placed on the player themselves.
1.12. Pro: Discussions about potential fees make football more exciting.
