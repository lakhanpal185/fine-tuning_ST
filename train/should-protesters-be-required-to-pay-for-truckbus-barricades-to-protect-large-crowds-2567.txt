Discussion Title: Should protesters be required to pay for truck/bus barricades to protect large crowds?

1. Should protesters be required to pay for truck/bus barricades to protect large crowds?
1.1. Pro: This would ensure safety to the crowds attending protests from vehicle attacks.
1.2. Con: Sport matches, fairs, concerts and other open-air festivities also draw large crowns and extra police forces or even vehicle barricades may be necessary, yet no one expects individuals to pay for it.
1.2.1. Con: These types of events should also have to pay for additional barricades.
1.2.2. Con: Great point. However, keep in mind that these types of events you've mentioned typically add revenue to the community where as protests either typically do not add additional revenue to a community or, in some cases, cost the community money via vandalism or when the protests turn into riots. Maybe the burden of added protection should be on them rather than the community at large?
1.3. Con: It is the duty of the state to ensure that people can protest safely.
1.3.1. Con: Great point. However, what about when the protesting group is one that often advocate or participates in violence to certain groups? \(Ie. KKK, ANTIFA, Black Live Matter, Neo-Nazis\)
1.4. Pro: Legally making protest organisers think carefully about safety might encourage them to take other measures to promote participant safety.
1.4.1. Pro: Protestors sometimes find themselves [at risk](https://abcnews.go.com/US/sexual-assaults-occupy-wall-street-camps/story?id=14873014) of sexual assault, something which the organisers or protest could take more steps to combat.
1.5. Con: Groups who cannot afford to pay for safety measures should still be allowed to protest safely.
