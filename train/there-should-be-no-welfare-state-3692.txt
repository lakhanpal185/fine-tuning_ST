Discussion Title: There should be no welfare state.

1. There should be no welfare state.
1.1. Con: The state has a moral obligation to fight inequality.
1.1.1. Con: A moral obligation to protect inequality does not necessitate becoming a caregiver to people.
1.1.2. Con: No matter how much inequality there is, the state ought not intervene.
1.1.3. Pro: Income inequality makes people [unhappy](https://hbr.org/2016/01/income-inequality-makes-whole-countries-less-happy).
1.1.3.1. Pro: [Research](https://www3.nd.edu/~adutt/activities/documents/GrahamInequalityAndHappiness2.pdf) In Latin American establishes that "inequality has significant effects on well being", so those with more income report being 5% happier than the average and those in the lowest end of income report being 3% less happy.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: While the study shows that people with high income are happier than those with low income, it does not support the initial claim that "inequality makes people unhappy", because there is no claim about how equality would affect overall happiness.
1.1.3.2. Pro: It is resonable to think that money has a decreasing marginal utility hence redistributing money or free and sometimes essential services from richer to poorer increases happyness as a one dollar bill increases happiness more for a poor person than for a rich person. Hence if a welfare state reduce inequality without reducing productivity it also increases happiness.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Redistribution might have more negative consequenses for society than the redistribution of money creates e.g. reduce incentives to be productive
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Higher welfare \(e.g. better health\) seem to often also lead to higher growth \(measured as GDP per capita increases\) [blogs.imf.org](https://blogs.imf.org/2018/03/07/welfare-versus-gdp-what-makes-people-better-off/)
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Welfare states do not have [lower GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita) per capita than other types of states.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Welfare, or protection for the worst-off, is what every rational person would want if their social station is not known in advance.
1.1.3.4. Con: The [source](https://hbr.org/2016/01/income-inequality-makes-whole-countries-less-happy) presents correlations, but fails to establish causation. Life-satisfaction is generally lower in countries with high income inequality, but the U.S. are on par with Sweden in that measure. Italy, France, Spain and Mauritius are worse off than the U.S. in all three measurements. This suggests that it is not about income inequality per se; Colombia and South Africa significantly drag down life satisfaction on the unequal side.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.1.3.5. Pro: The 2017 UN [World Happiness Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report) lists the happiest countries in the world as Norway, Denmark and Iceland. All three countries have very large and expansive welfare states, as do the other 7 countries in the top 10.
1.1.3.5.1. Con: There are many factors that influence on this ranking, we can't just think these countries owe their happiness to welfare states. On the same ranking you can see how dimensions such as trust, freedom to make choices, generosity and healthy life expectancy have an impact on this. You can also see that many countries with high social support are not well positioned on the list.
1.1.3.5.2. Con: This implies that happiness trumps the morality of not stealing since welfare systems are generally supported by taxes.
1.1.3.5.2.1. Pro: Taxation is coercive and theft. No one should have their ius naturale to property violated; whatever the goal is. Charity must be voluntary.
1.1.3.5.2.1.1. Pro: Taxation is theft because it involves the appropriation of a citizen's wealth and prevents them from using their wealth as they freely choose.
1.1.3.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Taxation is payment for society as a service, it is not appropriation.
1.1.3.5.2.1.1.2. Con: Hidden in this argument is the premise that a private individual can make judicious use of all the technological advances and infrastructure and human connections made available through a society believing in social investment, and derive from these a pre-tax profit that solely belongs to them despite the severe dependencies on socialized institutions. It is common convention to believe this, even amongst those who don't believe taxation is theft, but it is fallacious.
1.1.3.5.2.1.2. Con: The individual is not duty bound to acquire wealth by the state, so the payment of tax is only in response to a freely made decision to attempt to do so and therefore cannot be considered theft.
1.1.3.5.2.1.3. Con: If people want to live in a state, they consent to the rules and regulations. Tax rules are part of this and cannot be divorced. If someone does not want to pay taxes, they should move somewhere else and not avail of any services, like roads, hospitals, etc.
1.1.3.5.2.1.3.1. Con: There is no such place and you cannot steal people just because they were born in "your" land.
1.1.3.5.2.1.3.2. Con: Taxes and welfare state are not needed to build roads or provide health care. You did not provide an argument.
1.1.3.5.2.1.4. Pro: The welfarestate is financed with taxes, which is money taken from the people under threat of violence or imprisonment.
1.1.3.5.2.1.4.1. Con: The state having 'the monopoly of the legitimate use of [violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence)' is a core concept of public law that applies to most, if not all, countries. Through legitimization, the state ensures that it can use violence when necessary to guarantee social peace and to prevent crime.
1.1.3.5.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: Without coercive measure like prison or economic fines, and without the legitimate use of force, a state is not able to uphold the rule of law.
1.1.3.5.2.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.5.2.1.3.
1.1.3.5.2.1.5. Con: Paying money for a welfare state is the price of living in a society.
1.1.3.5.2.1.5.1. Con: Many people have lived in many societies that do not pay money for a welfare state.
1.1.3.5.2.1.5.1.1. Con: The majority of modern societies that have no social expenditures are undesirable places to live at best. Whereas the [wealthiest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita) and [happiest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report#International_rankings) countries tend to have [robust social expenditures](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?datasetcode=SOCX_AGG) and/or [sovereign funds that provide a basic income](https://www.swfinstitute.org/sovereign-wealth-fund-rankings/).
1.1.3.5.2.1.5.2. Con: Paying money for a welfare state is the price of assuaging ones conscience while accomplishing little to nothing of actual charitable value
1.1.3.5.2.1.6. Con: There does not seem to have been any successful human society where there has been no sharing of resources. In traditional hunter-gatherer societies, refusing to share the rewards of your foraging or hunting is considered anathema. [For example](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/29/why-bushman-banter-was-crucial-to-hunter-gatherers-evolutionary-success), the Ju/’hoansi of the Kalahari desert are fiercely egalitarian.
1.1.3.6. Pro: Inequality is bad for everyone.
1.1.3.6.1. Con: Inequality, by its very definition, is not bad for everyone. Equality of outcome, however, is \(due to scarcity\), equally bad for everyone.
1.1.3.7. Con: There are many theoretical models regarding happiness, like [PERMA](https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/perma-model/), psychological [well-being](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/making-change/201001/the-big-three-the-foundation-lasting-happiness) and self-esteem, the [Ryff Scales](http://www.liberalarts.wabash.edu/ryff-scales/) or [self-determination theory](http://psych415.class.uic.edu/Readings/Ryan,%20Happiness%20-%20well%20being,%20AnnRevPsy,%202001.pdf), none of these models include income as a significant variable for predicting happiness.
1.1.3.7.1. Con: If lack of income is likely to make basic needs not covered, and failing to meet [basic needs](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/making-change/201001/the-big-three-the-foundation-lasting-happiness) can lead to “neglecting health care and experiencing a sense of helplessness in life” therefore there is a meaningful connection between income \(at least, at the lower end\) and happiness.
1.1.3.7.2. Con: Self-determination theory and other [research](http://psych415.class.uic.edu/Readings/Ryan,%20Happiness%20-%20well%20being,%20AnnRevPsy,%202001.pdf) around happiness also concludes that in poorer nations, "the value of money for satisfying needs may be more critical" than in a "nation where most citizens have access to some basic resources for pursuing their goals".
1.1.3.7.2.1. Pro: The same [authors](http://psych415.class.uic.edu/Readings/Ryan,%20Happiness%20-%20well%20being,%20AnnRevPsy,%202001.pdf) also point to different values to achieve happiness, yet once "a person is beyond poverty level \(and thus has sustenance and security\)".
1.1.3.8. Con: [Research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/making-change/201001/the-big-three-the-foundation-lasting-happiness) also points that lasting happiness is more difficult if basic needs are not satisfied, thus it is not income inequality what causes unhappiness, but not being able to cover basic needs.
1.1.3.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.7.1.
1.1.4. Pro: Too much inequality will result in violence. Since governments are there to protect their citizens, they should prevent that.
1.1.4.1. Con: Relative poverty does not excuse violence. The state shouldn't encourage this violations by redistribution, but instead protect poverty rights.
1.1.4.2. Con: It is not inequality that leads to violence, but perceived injustice.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Inequality is at the root of perceived injustice.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: In a system, which is perceived as fair, failure will be attributed to oneself. Thus a lower incentive for violence towards others is given.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Welfare can reduce crime.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Welfare states give the poor a stake in society, and this makes them less inclined to become terrorists or support extreme political causes that might destabilise or overthrow democratic society.
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: Welfare states promote public order by ensuring citizens do not feel the need to commit crimes in order to maintain a basic standard of living.
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: For the years of [2008-2012](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5137) the US Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that persons in poor households at or below the Federal Poverty Level had more than double the rate of violent victimization as persons in high-income households.
1.1.4.3.3.1. Con: This shows a correlation, but not necessarily a causative link. It is also possible that more violent people are less likely to succeed in a civilized society, or potentially that less educated people – who would as such be less successful as well – might be more violent.
1.1.4.3.4. Pro: A country with a GDP per capita of $250 has a 15% possibilities of [violent conflict](http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/Articles/When-do-inequalities-cause-conflict) in a span of five years while a country with a GDP of $1250 per person has only a 4% chance.
1.1.4.3.4.1. Con: Wealth is [highly correlated](http://www.heritage.org/index/download) to economic freedom and vice versa. Therefore civil war might be about freedom not poverty.
1.1.4.3.4.2. Con: A welfare state has more to do with reducing inequality \(measured by [Gini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient), for example\), not making everyone richer \(which would be measured by GDP\). Redistribution does not change the average Per Capita GDP.
1.1.4.3.5. Pro: A study by [Akee et. al \(2010\)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.2.1.86) shows that a government cash transfer might significantly increase education for children coming from poor backgrounds as well as decreasing the probability of minor criminal offences.
1.1.4.3.6. Pro: Gated communities do not exist in countries with highly functional social welfare, because the rich have nothing to fear.
1.1.4.3.7. Con: Many crimes do not occur due to economic problems. For instance many crimes stem from issues with [drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug-related_crime), [mental illness](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854807312851), or [relationships](http://law.jrank.org/pages/1177/Family-Relationships-Crime-General-socialization-crime.html).
1.1.4.3.7.1. Con: There is a [positive relationship](https://borgenproject.org/addiction-poverty-connected/) between poverty and substance \(drugs\) abuse.
1.1.4.3.7.1.1. Con: Positive relationship aka correlation doesn't imply causation. The second sentence in the linked above article states: " The direction of causation is unclear". The strongest claim that article makes is that poverty cause drug abuse is: "...and perhaps even some causal effect." Also it completely ignores that the can be no casual effect in any directions i.e. that there is other hidden factor\(s\) that has casual relation to both poverty and drug abuse.
1.1.4.3.8. Con: There is a higher correlation between unemployment and crime than between income level and crime \([Hooge et al, 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262933140_Unemployment_Inequality_Poverty_and_Crime_Spatial_Distribution_Patterns_of_Criminal_Acts_in_Belgium_2001-06)\).
1.1.4.3.8.1. Con: Unemployment leads to crime due to economic desperation and alienation. A wealthy unemployed person is not likely to commit crimes.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Welfare may reduce civil unrest and war.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: [Research](http://ftp.iza.org/dp1450.pdf) on inequality and development support that for a democracy to be able to sustain the rule of law and avoid conflict, inequality in resource endowments and income needs to be sufficiently low.
1.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: On the other hand, strong economic inequality can only sustain the social contract under an oligarchic ruling system.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.4.1.
1.1.5. Pro: At least everyone deserves equal opportunities.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Affordable education for anyone is necessary for equal opportunities.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Public education produces net economic and social benefits for the whole society.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.elc-pa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/BestInvestment_Full_Report_6.27.11.pdf) concludes that quality education leads to more employable individuals who, in turn, are active and productive citizens.
1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Educated individuals are also less likely to commit [crimes](https://www.elc-pa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/BestInvestment_Full_Report_6.27.11.pdf).
1.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: Providing good quality education makes citizens less likely to rely on other forms of [welfare](https://www.elc-pa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/BestInvestment_Full_Report_6.27.11.pdf).
1.1.5.1.1.4. Pro: [Studies](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/12/fixing-public-schools-for-a-better-economy/419526/) link an increase in GDP \([Gross Domestic Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product)\) with good quality education.
1.1.5.1.1.4.1. Pro: Economists predict that if all students in the US had a  basic mastery as defined by The National Assessment of Educational Progress \([NAEP](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/)\), the  GDP of the US would increase by [$32 trillion](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/12/fixing-public-schools-for-a-better-economy/419526/).
1.1.5.2. Con: This doesn't support the notion that the state should fight wealth inequality via welfare. Equal opportunities does not mean equal outcomes. There can be complete equality of opportunity and still there would be rich people and poor people because people behave differently.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: However, if the conditions to ensure equal opportunities are not met, one may argue that state intervention is necessary so citizens have a similar start, even if the final outcome is differs.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Inequality and injustice hurts both, people and the economy. Welfare is a highly needed tool to compensate for [The Price of Inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_of_Inequality).
1.1.6. Con: The state does not have this moral obligation for several reasons.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Not all inequality is bad. It can be beneficial for a society.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Inequality is partly a consequence of individual performance. Fighting this inequality attacks the incentives to higher performance.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Inequality is partly a consequence of individual choices. Fighting this inequality attacks the responsibility of the individual.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: People with unhealthy habits can subsidize their bad behavior with the medicine bills, which are payed for by the welfare state. This increases the incentives for unhealthy live-styles.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: There are forms of inequality that no one tries to erase. For example: No one demands equal audience sizes for different singers.
1.1.6.1.4. Pro: Inequality is partly a consequence of people differing vastly in their talents and abilities to create value for others, it is only just that those who create more value can enjoy more material comforts.
1.1.6.1.4.1. Con: Wealth is currently often unrelated to talent and ability to create value for others. Where capital growth rate is greater than wage increases, wealth is related primarily to access to capital and thus primarily inheritance.
1.1.6.2. Pro: There is no formal definition of equality that is robust enough for government officials to act upon without the risk of personal / group preferences.
1.1.6.3. Pro: The state should only protect rights and not provide rights. Everyone has the right to be protected from thievery, but nobody should have a right to free stuff.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: States not only protect rights, they are also instrumental in providing them. For example, the right to vote, the right to express opinions freely, the right to have freedom of religion or the right to have a fair and public trial.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: All the above stated examples are protections of rights. Voting is there to protect from tyranny. Freedom of speech and religion are also protections for attacks on your personal freedom. Fair trails protect you from thievery etc.
1.1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Organising and carriyng out elections, creating and mantaining a judiciary system or even implementing law enforcement through a police force are possible thanks to governamental structures that, not only conceptually protect rights, but offer tangible instruments to provide those said rights to their citizens.
1.1.6.3.1.1.2. Pro: Welfare state also protects rights: it protects the right to equality.
1.1.6.3.1.1.2.1. Con: For something to be a right, it must pre-exist government. Equality not only does not pre-exist government, it requires government enforcement and coercion. Therefore, there is no such thing as a right to equality. There are many things we see as desirable or as necessary that are not rights.
1.1.6.3.2. Con: This is a semantic argument. Any state action can be phrased as a protection or as providing. e.g. Everyone should be provided safety from thievery, or everybody should be protected from lack of stuff.
1.1.6.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.1.1.2.
1.1.6.3.4. Con: The state, through the democratically negotiated rights enshrined in law, protects all rights, whether that is the right to be protected from theft or the right to freedom from poverty. The rich always privilege law and order in discussions of this nature, but there is no reason why theft is different from targeted poverty. Both are violations towards the dignity of members of society.
1.1.7. Con: The welfare state does not succeed in fighting inequality.
1.1.7.1. Pro: An individual that receives welfare benefits would have less incentive to seek out wages and save for the long-term, increasing inequality.
1.1.7.2. Con: Most studies about inequality and welfare do not account for in-kind benefits and thus may produce misleading results.
1.1.7.3. Pro: There is a huge welfare state in western countries, but still a concentration of wealth.
1.1.7.3.1. Con: The fact that we can't cure something doesn't mean we shouldn't mitigate it. This is the same concept with medication for symptoms, firefighters for fires, and police for crime.
1.1.7.3.2. Con: Welfare is intended to mitigate poverty, not income inequality. Other methods are required to address that issue.
1.1.7.3.3. Con: The welfare state should be even bigger to address the problem.
1.1.7.4. Con: The concentration in wealth and "wealth gap" is less in countries with robust welfare systems. It alleviates the problem \(even if not solves\).
1.1.7.4.1. Pro: With an average social expenditure of [7.4%](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare%27s_effect_on_poverty) of the GDP \(on non-elderly citizens\), countries achieve a reduction of poverty of 60.9%. Therefore, there seems to be a clear link between a strong developed welfare state and the reduction of poverty.
1.1.7.4.1.1. Pro: A country like Sweden that has a social expenditure of 11.6% of the GDP manages to [reduce poverty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare%27s_effect_on_poverty#)byv77.4% while a country like the US with a expenditure of 2.3% only manages to reduce it by 26.4%.
1.1.7.4.2. Pro: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \([OECD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD)\), which is an organisation comprised by 35 countries, asserts that [welfare](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/14/wealth-gap-widens-austerity-inequlity_n_3275538.html) spending is key to reduce economic inequality and poverty.
1.1.7.5. Con: There is a distinction between "solve" and "mitigate". Someone might not "succeed" in stopping the problem of the land being of lower elevation than the ocean, but they might "succeed" in mitigating the problem by building a dike.
1.1.7.6. Con: It does stop people from starving.
1.1.7.7. Con: The moment a government taxes a wealthy person and gives the money to a poor person, inequality has been solved.
1.1.8. Con: The welfare state is immoral.
1.1.8.1. Con: The state is already a welfare state by favoring the richest and most powerful.
1.1.8.2. Pro: It is immoral to force people to help someone.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: Many traditional ethical or religious frameworks do not endorse this view. For example, the ancient Jewish ethical practice of gleaning was a legal obligation. Jesus backed up failure to help one's neighbors with the threat of hell \(Matt. 25:41-45\), which would imply that alms given by his followers are in fact made involuntarily. Zakat, or the giving of alms to the poor is one of the 5 pillars of Islam, and is likewise considered a punishable offence and is mandatory in many Muslim countries.
1.1.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.1.8.2.3. Con: It is immoral to allow others to die preventable deaths while you sit by and watch.  It is immoral to not give if someone asks you for help and helping them wouldn't hinder you.
1.1.8.2.4. Con: [Catholic Social Teaching​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rerum_novarum) tells us that it is a moral imperative to create a society where the dignity of all people is protected.
1.1.8.2.5. Con: What one "must" do \(aka the imperitive, what one "is forced to do," or "the law"\) is the defining characteristic of morality/ethics.
1.1.8.2.6. Con: Currency gained from work is a representation of ones contribution to society. All people contribute to society as consumers, family, or by otherwise adding to the human experience of those around them. People should be compensated in some way for their more abstract contributions.
1.1.8.2.6.1. Pro: When the amount of money one can earn is decided by the market, whose sole purpose is to generate wealth, those whose talents lie in areas which are not directly profitable suffer, although profitability is not necessarily linked to value.
1.1.8.2.7. Con: Under Ethical philosophies like [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) it is in fact not immoral to force someone to help others if there are net pleasures involved
1.1.8.2.7.1. Con: Utalitarism has no objective standard to measure wether there are net pleasures or losses.
1.1.8.2.8. Pro: The means can't be justified by the end alone. Amoral methods can't become moral only by pointing towards moral goals.
1.1.8.2.8.1. Con: Welfare is a moral means to a moral end.
1.1.8.2.9. Con: A society in which a CEO can make an eight or nine figure salary whilst the people at the bottom of the company ladder can work full time and not be able to pay the bills is more immoral. By taxing the richest just a little more and using this to help people down on their luck we achieve a more equal society that looks after one another.
1.1.8.2.9.1. Con: It is better if the CEO voluntarily gives his money to poor people.
1.1.8.2.9.2. Con: It is better if people stop buying from companies with wage policies that they think are immoral
1.1.8.2.10. Con: It is more immoral to fight not to help someone and letting him die.
1.1.8.2.10.1. Con: People might want to help, but voluntarily and in freedom
1.1.8.2.11. Con: It is moral to force people to help someone
1.1.8.2.12. Con: There are no morals, only laws which express the will of the people.
1.1.8.2.12.1. Con: There are universal morals, created by God.
1.1.8.2.12.2. Con: 51% of the people can be wrong
1.1.8.2.13. Con: Criminal negligence, criminal recklessness, criminal endangerment, willful blindness and other related crimes are punishable by law.
1.1.8.2.14. Con: A welfare system is not necessarily a system that forces people to help someone. Paying a tax under a welfare system is essentially a payment for services provided by the state.
1.1.8.2.14.1. Con: People are forced to pay for the services that the state has choosen to provide.
1.1.8.2.14.1.1. Con: The state derives its authority to provide those services and levy those taxes from the consent of its governed. While a minority of people may feel oppressed by having to participate in society, most consent to some form of social contract because it is in their long-term best interests.
1.1.8.2.14.2. Con: A person who earns a high income almost always does so through hard work or exceptional skill. A person who is poor may be poor because of his/her own failings. Taxing higher earners to pay for laggards is taking from the best elements of society to subsidize the worst.
1.1.8.2.14.2.1. Con: It is very common for one's income to have no correlation to one's hard work or skill.
1.1.8.2.14.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.2.4.
1.1.8.2.14.2.3. Con: Many people acquire wealth through inheritance, settlements, selling mineral rights, and other circumstances not associated with skill or hard work.
1.1.8.2.14.2.3.1. Pro: More than 20% of those in Forbes 400 most rich, [inherited](http://www.faireconomy.org/press_room/2012/report_says_forbes_400_misleads_about_wealth_and_opportunity) enough wealth to just make it to the list.
1.1.8.2.14.2.4. Con: A person who works hard for minimum wage is less of a laggard than a person who solely lives off of capital gains and literally makes money while they sleep.
1.1.8.2.14.2.4.1. Con: Just because a person is "earning money while they sleep" does not mean that they work less than a person on minimum wage.  Perhaps the wealthy do not need to work, but this does not mean that the wealthy do not work.  On the contrary, looking at [the richest men in the world](http://time.com/money/4746795/richest-people-in-the-world/), most of them inexplicably continue to work full-time.
1.1.8.2.14.2.4.1.1. Con: Wealthy people have little incentive to work at all while nearly every poor person must work hard out of necessity. Comparing the two groups, it's likely more poor people are hard working compared to wealthy people who are hard working.  'Hard working' is a trait of necessity for the poor.
1.1.8.2.14.2.4.1.2. Con: The exceptions do not illustrate the norm.
1.1.8.2.14.2.4.2. Con: [Warren Buffet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett) is considered the third richest man in the world.  As the world's most successful investor, most of his wealth comes from capital gains while he sleeps.  Despite this, Warren Buffet continues to work full-time at the age of 87 when nearly everyone else would have long retired.
1.1.8.2.14.2.4.2.1. Con: Warren Buffet is exceptional.
1.1.8.2.14.2.4.3. Con: Many [millionares](https://www.forbes.com/sites/larissafaw/2013/01/29/why-do-the-mega-rich-continue-to-work/#630d27c17e2f) continue to work, even if economically they don't need to.
1.1.8.2.14.2.4.3.1. Con: Many millionaires don't work because it not not necessary for them to do so.
1.1.8.2.14.2.5. Con: Only [35%](https://inequality.org/research/selfmade-myth-hallucinating-rich/) of Forbes 400 most rich people come from low-income backgrounds \(with similar circumstances to 95% of Americans\) while 60%  grew up in substantial privilege.
1.1.8.2.15. Pro: Any taxation or regulation is bad for the economy by definition.
1.1.8.2.15.1. Con: Taxes are not universally bad for the economy. Under certain conditions, taxation can lead to economic growth via the [expenditure multiplier](http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&c=dsp&k=expenditures+multiplier).
1.1.8.2.15.1.1. Pro: The expenditure multiplier can be expressed as 1/\(1-MPC\), MPC being the "[marginal propensity to consume](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalpropensitytoconsume.asp)" or how much of each dollar of income is spent on average. If a tax transfers income 1:1 from a class with a lower MPC \(i.e. wealthy individuals\) to a class with a higher MPC \(i.e. poor and middle class individuals\), it increases the global expenditure multiplier, which drives economic growth.
1.1.8.2.15.2. Pro: Taxes remove money from the economy, losing money to pay public workers, and injecting the money artificially in any sector that, because it has grown artificially, may fall.
1.1.8.2.15.2.1. Con: Neither paying public workers nor making public investments removes any money from the economy.
1.1.8.2.15.3. Pro: For example, policies to help low income citizens make important services artificially more expensive and lower quality.
1.1.8.2.15.3.1. Pro: For example, healthcare regulations known as [Obamacare](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-24370967) made healthcare more expensive.
1.1.8.2.15.4. Con: It may be bad for the economy, but good for the people. There are proven circumstances where the interests of the economy and the individuals are not aligned \(Giffen goods: [economist.com](https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2007/07/as_price_goes_up_so_does_deman), environmental or labor regulation...\).
1.1.8.2.16. Pro: The simple lack of wealth does not give a person the entitlement to someone else's wealth.
1.1.8.2.16.1. Con: Wealth only exists as a means to maintain a social contract, thus it is reasonable for us to look for ways to keep a more stable society through redistribution of wealth, if necessary.
1.1.8.2.16.1.1. Pro: There is some threshold level of concentration of wealth at which it becomes economically advantageous for the "have not" classes to violently upend the social order. It is in everyone's best interests \(including the "have" classes\) to avoid reaching that point.
1.1.8.2.16.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.
1.1.8.2.16.2. Con: It is not the lack of wealth that gives such an entitlement, but rather the basic respect due to the mere existence of the person, as established in the [Human Rights Declaration](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/).
1.1.8.2.16.3. Con: One may doubt the origin of all wealth is the individual; in many cases, it was at least partly inherited or made possible by the state's infrastructure \(cf. "You didn't build that."[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_didn%27t_build_that)\).
1.1.8.2.17. Con: While it may be wrong to force individuals to assist people, this is the role of the government to ensure a thriving society. People pay taxes to allow the government to do this.
1.1.8.2.17.1. Con: People do not pay taxes voluntarily. If forcing people to pay something is amoral for an individual, it should be considered as amoral for the government, too.
1.1.8.2.17.1.1. Con: People agree on a social contract by using government resources, which allows the government to tax them. These taxes can be used for welfare.
1.1.8.2.17.1.1.1. Con: The existence of a social contract can argue for the legitimacy of taxes but not argue for the legitimacy of a welfare state. These are separate questions.
1.1.8.2.17.1.1.1.1. Pro: This logic would allow to use taxes for anything. E.g. building useless and empty cities, where no one wants to live.
1.1.8.2.17.1.1.1.2. Con: Society is a contract between individuals which took us from primitive hunter gatherers to today. The contract means that we agree to operate collectively for the good of all. We collectively protect our roads \(signage, repairs\), protect our houses and properties \(fireman, police\) , and also protect the poorest & sickest in our society.
1.1.8.2.17.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The concept of a social contract where we agree on maintaining a civil society bound by the Rule of Law or, at least, good manners suggests that we should look after those who can't look after themselves.
1.1.8.2.17.1.1.2. Con: This is circular reasoning. People are using government resource because they've got subsidised by taxes in the first place. That way private solutions can't compete with the price, although they might have been more efficient.
1.1.8.2.17.1.1.3. Pro: The social contract means - that we can buy a boat without buying a dud \(government safety / standards bodies\) we move it safely to a port \(roads, signage, speed limits, traffic enforcement\), we can be assured it wont be stolen \(police, laws\), and if it is we get resolution \(courts, laws, jails\), and if it sinks \(rescue services\). All social contract government resources - and yet we never say lets do without those because they're more efficient in a free market.
1.1.8.2.18. Con: It is only not moral if you subscribe to pure individualism where your personal needs are put ahead of the community.
1.1.8.2.18.1. Con: Someone might want to put others' needs before his own, but voluntarily and in freedom.
1.1.8.2.19. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.5.2.1.
1.1.8.2.20. Pro: The welfare state is an impersonal, unloving and cold way of caring for people. Care among family, friends, neighbors and other caring people, voluntary and free is better and more humane.
1.1.8.2.20.1. Con: Family and friends can give moral and psychological support, however, they may not have the tools to offer structured help \(e.g. an education system, healthcare\) and they may not have enough money to assist those in need in practical ways.
1.1.8.3. Pro: The welfare state will make people dependent on itself.
1.1.8.3.1. Pro: The welfare state [subsidizes](http://www.economicsjunkie.com/us-poverty-rate-how-the-great-society-programs-reversed-its-decline/) poverty and actually [creates](https://fee.org/articles/if-you-accept-this-raise-you-fall-off-the-welfare-cliff/) poverty.
1.1.8.3.1.1. Con: The welfare state doesn't enforce \(or prolong\) poverty. Poverty is prolonged by the disparity between welfare and a liveable minimum wage \(when the government adjusts benefits to match inflation and living costs and the job market doesn't, welfare recipients take a dangerous hit to their income when getting back on their feet\)
1.1.8.3.1.2. Con: There is a calculable threshold over which the welfare recipient could work and be better off; it varies by state and locality, but is always only marginally above the local poverty level, or in some cases below it.

If this threshold, which is pegged to the poverty level, is so high as to be insurmountable by the private sector, this proves that the private sector can't provide a better deal for the poor and that state action is needed to prevent families from going under the poverty line.
1.1.8.3.2. Con: The state subsidises wealthy interests through a great number of market interventions. If it can afford to make the rich dependant on it, it can certainly afford to fund the poor.
1.1.8.3.2.1. Pro: For example, the EU has a long list of grants and subsidies for [industry](https://www.welcomeurope.com/european-subsidies-sector-Industry.html#afficheTexte) development.
1.1.8.3.2.2. Pro: In the US, industries receive government aid via tax breaks, grants, loans and other subsidies. In the last 15 years the federal government has given [$68 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/03/17/the-united-states-of-subsidies-the-biggest-corporate-winners-in-each-state/) to business, and two thirds of the otal have been handed out to large corporations.
1.1.8.3.3. Con: The state is the people. People depending on themselves is the definition of self-reliance.
1.1.8.3.3.1. Con: The state is created by people, to protect the people, from people. The argument is, that the sate is there to guarantee the rights of the indviduals, not to look after them, in an ethical sense.
1.1.8.3.4. Con: While the welfare state fails when it generates people depending on it, it is a very powerful tool to ease the pain of anyone's misfortune. When you made a bad decision or had your share of bad luck, some kind of "social trampoline" that springs you back to normal life is enormously useful for the whole society.
1.1.8.3.5. Pro: A welfare state creates a dependent society.  The dependents will then vote for candidates who will continue to provide for them.
1.1.8.3.5.1. Pro: The state is not a perfect entity. It is disconnected from the actual needs of the population and is ineffective, thus perpetuating a welfare trap for generations of a single family stuck relying on the state.
1.1.8.3.6. Con: People are dependent on the state regardless of welfare. Without the enforcement of law, the protection of the public good, the infrastructures, the education and, arguably, the military, no modern society is possible. We may eventually emancipate from the need of state-like structures, but this dependency is present in any given modern state, regardless of welfare.
1.1.8.3.6.1. Con: Relying on the services provided by the state, such as a court system, law enforcement and military defense, must not be equated with dependency on welfare programs for basic needs. The state can only provide those services because there are people who produce enough surplus value that they can be taxed; they have a moral claim to get something in return. Welfare dependents, on the other hand, do not even produce enough to support their own lifestyle, and still use state services.
1.1.8.3.7. Con: Absence of welfare will make people absolutely dependent on their families and employers.
1.1.8.3.8. Con: Some welfare provision are time limited or subjects to previous contributions.
1.1.8.3.8.1. Pro: In some EU countries, [unemployment](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/10391238/Benefits-in-Europe-country-by-country.html) benefits are time limited, therefore recipients cannot rely on them indefinitely.
1.1.8.3.8.1.1. Pro: Most targeted unemployment benefits have time limitations. Across Europe, only Belgium guarantees unlimited unemployment benefits. In other countries the benefits last from 3 to 24 months for a worker with 22 years of contributions \([European Commission, pg. 5](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/european-semester_en)\).
1.1.8.3.8.2. Pro: Welfare programs like unemployment benefits are or can [contributory](http://www.rights4seniors.net/content/benefits-beginners), meaning that only those who have worked and paid taxes before can receive them.
1.1.8.3.9. Con: Forcing individuals to compete for their minimum needs such as medical care, housing, and food, decreases their ability to take on meaningful and socially significant labor and develop as individuals.
1.1.8.3.9.1. Con: Forcing individuals to compete for their minimum needs such as medical care, housing, and food, increases their desire to take on meaningful and economically significant labor and develop as societal contributors
1.1.8.3.10. Pro: The welfare state subsidizes the development and procreation of employment-resistant personalities \(low in conscientiousness and agreeableness\), who otherwise would have to control their impulses in order to remain gainfully employed, or would have no resources for children.
1.1.8.3.10.1. Con: There is no clear scientific cause for personalities. The prevailing Behavioral and Freudian theories are widely [disputed](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/13/news/la-ol-blowback-pscyhology-science-20120713) and reserach in [epigenitics](https://www.whatisepigenetics.com/fundamentals/) is not mature enough to offer answers.
1.1.8.3.10.2. Con: The ability of an individual to find employment is not determined by personality alone, but by many factors including education and the state of the economy.
1.1.8.3.10.3. Con: If true, the humane thing would be to correct these flaws, either through counseling, therapy, or some other means. The alternative would be to allow people with these negative traits to become desperately impoverished, and thus more likely to commit crimes.
1.1.8.3.11. Pro: People may lack motivation to find roles which allow them to support themselves and be part of a community if they know they can rely on the government to provide them with what they need.
1.1.8.3.11.1. Con: Germany has a very sophisticated [welfare state](https://www.internations.org/germany-expats/guide/15984-social-security-taxation/social-security-in-germany-15970), with a variety of public payments and benefits that enable citizens to live at least a humble life without work. Nevertheless, the [unemployment rate](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/unemployment-rate) is very low.
1.1.8.3.11.2. Con: In 2011 Iran established a [program](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income) that guaranteed citizens cash payments of equivalent to third of the nation's median income. A report found no evidence for the hypothesis this unconditional income reduced the willingness to work.
1.1.8.3.11.2.1. Pro: People engaged in the Iranian [service industry](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income) worked more than before the implementation of the payment program.
1.1.8.3.11.2.2. Pro: Iranian business people started to expand their [businesses](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income).
1.1.8.3.11.2.3. Pro: There is [evidence](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income) that citizens started to pursue more satisfying kind of work instead of leaving the labor market for good.
1.1.8.3.11.3. Con: The incentive to work is not to survive, but to obtain wealth. People don't want to be poor.
1.1.8.3.11.4. Pro: The free market naturally pays people for being productive. People may opt to do work that does not benefit the economy in any way and use their time for other pursuits.
1.1.8.3.11.4.1. Con: It is hard to see why people should be forced to work with absolutely no qualifiers.
1.1.8.3.11.4.2. Con: Under our current system, some people commit crimes. The general consensus is that crime — although it is work that enriches the individual — is not to the benefit of the economy. Yet still, the free market encourages it.
1.1.8.3.11.4.3. Con: In an increasingly global economy, there is very little work that can objectively be deemed 'non-beneficial to the economy.' The online entertainment, gaming, and creative market through Platforms such as patreon, youtube, and twitch allow individuals to contribute to the economy and get paid by playing video games, creating art and music, or simply being likeable on camera.
1.1.8.4. Con: Inherent information asymmetries between players in a market inevitably give rise to monopolies that could result in tyranny. Redistribution prevents that.
1.1.8.4.1. Pro: Unregulated sectors of human activity \(political or financial\) inevitably lead to power being accumulated in the hands of the few. This phenomenon has been observed in a variety of contexts, and is variously referred to as the[Pareto Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution), [80/20 Rule](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwivysa-hcXXAhUnslQKHXbfCOYQtwIIKDAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DF-I-BVqMiNI&usg=AOvVaw0wEtTOA70fg_IJgI9GxUoC), or the [Mathew Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect).
1.1.8.4.1.1. Con: "The hands of the few" means a small percentage of the population. Which individuals, in flesh and blood, this percentage consist of, however, does change over time. Hence, the underlying idea that some specific group of individuals will gather the riches, is inherently misleading.
1.1.8.4.1.2. Con: [There is no known effective method for combating this tendency](https://youtu.be/TcEWRykSgwE?t=2m50s).
1.1.8.4.1.2.1. Con: Because the underlying condition cannot be addressed, some degree of redistribution to soften the results \(i.e. welfare\) is warranted.
1.1.8.4.1.3. Pro: [The Nordic System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model) adopted by many European countries has measurably reduced income inequality and limited poverty. Therefore, measures can and have been taken to mitigate the natural accumulation of wealth to the upper echelons of society.
1.1.8.4.1.3.1. Con: You still see income inequalities across the different group spans. This is because, when you give people the freedom of choice, as in equality of opportunity, [people make different choices](http://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/arbetsmarknad/sysselsattning-forvarvsarbete-och-arbetstider/yrkesregistret-med-yrkesstatistik/pong/statistiknyhet/yrkesregistret-med-yrkesstatistik-2016/). As such, [women are, for example, much more likely to study nursing and childcare](https://www.google.se/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.uka.se/download/18.5d85793915901d205f9a852/1487841854015/rapport-2016-10-14-kvinnor-och-man-i-hogskolan.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiDz5-Wzp_eAhUjl4sKHXUwDMYQFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw19_qKwWIW2k7PM0Ra8F2Ea), which are underpaid occupations, leading to more inequality of outcome.
1.1.8.4.2. Con: Inherent information asymmetries also exist in the democratic mechanisms that vote welfare into existence. Superior knowledge can benefit one side unjustly or create ineffective/inverted welfare programs.
1.1.8.4.2.1. Con: The difference is that, in a democratic government, the welfare system is accountable to voters who may vote their own interests. A private monopolist, on the other hand, may only be accountable to a subgroup of shareholders or close ownership, whose interests may diverge wildly from those of the greater society.
1.1.8.4.3. Con: While a market of competing players might result in a monopoly, that might be tyrannic, the welfare state is deemed to be tyrannic due to its coercive financing.
1.1.8.4.4. Con: Redistribution simply shortcuts straight to tyranny and government sponsored monopolies, rather than preventing the same
1.1.8.4.4.1. Con: The negative aspects of a monopoly in private industry are results of coercive and absolute price-setting power. This power allows an unaccountable entity to profit by abusing its buyer and supplier classes. If a state is democratically accountable to its people and has no profit motivation, a state monopoly does not present the same fundamental problem.
1.1.8.4.4.1.1. Con: State actors have repeatedly displayed the very behavior described, using its price-setting power as a bludgeon against suppliers and buyers within a market.
1.1.8.4.4.1.1.1. Con: In democratic systems, buyers and suppliers who feel unjustly burdened by the government have recourse: they can achieve redress through the right to petition the government and lobby legislators and regulators, and they can work politically on behalf of candidates for office who share their interests.
1.1.8.4.5. Con: Monopolies can only come about by companies socializing the cost of monopoly enforcement through the state. Conversely, enforcement of a monopoly would be prohibitively expensive without the state. Therefore state coerced redistribution leads to monopolies rather than preventing them.
1.1.8.4.5.1. Con: While it is accurate to say that almost any given monopoly can be traced to one government policy or another, this does not mean that all government policies necessarily give rise to monopolies.
1.1.8.4.6. Con: The state has a necessary monopoly on services like the judicial system, security and law enforcement. The welfare state is an attempt to expand its monopolies into other areas of its citizens' lives \(e.g. healthcare, social security, etc\).
1.1.8.4.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.4.4.1.
1.1.8.4.6.2. Con: There are many [forms](http://www.cas.ed.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/89033/Ebbinghaus_-_Stream_2.pdf) of welfare state. Some are hybrid or liberal, like New Zealand. Services such as universal healthcare are funded by tax revenues but there is also a free market for people who prefer to choose. The consent to fair taxation is offset by a first-world health system that saves costs in other parts of the economy.
1.1.8.5. Con: Government \(and ideally a majority of voters\) have made the decision that forcing people to pay in for a safety net  is more moral, than an unstable private safety net.
1.1.8.5.1. Pro: If everyone is forced to help the poor to some degree, the burden is shared with everyone in society. Erasing force completely creates a higher burden on a less amount of people. This is, a self-sustaining spiral, [such as which create and force governments to subsidize high-risk insurance pools](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/02/18/514991567/gop-leaders-urge-return-to-high-risk-insurance-pools-that-critics-call-costly).
1.1.8.5.1.1. Con: "Everyone being forced to help the poor to some degree" is the entire point of the welfare system. In practice, this duty falls to the government because it is the only institution with coercive power over every citizen.
1.1.8.5.2. Con: Living in a state, and legitimising that state by voting and using its resources and benefits mean you have consented to be governed. Therefore it is not force, it is tacit consent.
1.1.8.5.2.1. Con: Being born into a state and growing up there as a child, making use of the resources made available to you by your family, wherever they originate, is not consent to be governed by a state. At what point is one supposed to leave, if they do not consent to the power of the state being used against them?
1.1.8.5.3. Con: Where there is no safety act there is a ripple of affect that affects others in that state - so you aren't just providing a safety net for others but also for yourself.
1.1.8.5.4. Con: A private safety net can also be stable, and even more stable.
1.1.8.6. Con: What is deemed moral or immoral is relative and changes over time and place.
1.1.8.7. Con: The absence of a welfare state is immoral.
1.1.8.7.1. Pro: It is immoral to force those who, through no choice of their own, were born into a specific position within \(a capitalist\) society, and who lack either the will, the ability, or both to meaningfully participate within it, particularly when the options to leave are linked to the position of birth, and are more platitude than reality. Those with the volition and ability to participate in dominant culture add to that domination, and therefore hold personal responsibility towards those less capable.
1.1.8.7.1.1. Con: It is immoral to force those who, through no choice of their own, were born into a specific position within \(a welfare\) society, who lack either the will, the ability, or both to meaningfully participate within it \(etc., etc.\)
1.1.8.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.3.9.
1.1.8.7.3. Con: The absence of a welfare state is to raise the moral of private property above that of equality
1.1.8.7.4. Con: To call the absence of something immoral is to raise the requirement of positive obligations. Positive obligations are most infamously contained in the Marxist claim "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need," which have led to the greatest [atrocities](http://communiststats.com/) in the history of the world.
1.1.8.7.4.1. Con: Post hoc ergo propter hoc. Atrocities are a constant and recurring theme in human history. No single economic \(or political\) system can be considered a necessary precursor for their occurance.
1.1.8.7.4.1.1. Pro: "Mercantilist/Colonialist economics killed millions worldwide." If one counts famines due to misallocation as an atrocity \(as is typically done to inflate death tolls in the cases of China and the USSR\), the [British empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_major_famines_in_India_during_British_rule) starved somewhere between 16-35 million people to death in South Asia, including 2-5 million Bengali people deliberately left to [starve](http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/1279/1/U062489.pdf) in just one year as resources were diverted to provision British troops during World War II.
1.1.8.7.4.2. Pro: The [10 planks](http://laissez-fairerepublic.com/tenplanks.html) for communism all require positive obligations -- \(e.g. abolition of private property require everyone to give their property to the state\).
1.1.8.7.4.3. Con: To consider a positive obligation that a state provides a minimum living standard to its citizens, so they do not starve or die of preventable deaths, is not Marxist or communist.  In fact, European forms of welfare were enacted by [conservatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state#History_of_welfare_states) in the 19th century to disengage workers from unions and socialism.
1.1.8.7.4.4. Con: In human rights law, a [positive obligation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_obligations) refers to a State obligation to carry out activities to secure “the effective enjoyment of a fundamental right”.
1.1.8.7.4.5. Con: The Marxist defense of those atrocities was the concept of "the dictatorship of the proletariat" – not "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"
1.1.8.7.4.6. Con: The slope is not slippery. Most countries that have welfare states are not Marxist dictatorships.
1.1.8.7.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.5.
1.1.8.7.5. Pro: The welfare state is necessary to ensure our rights as human beings.
1.1.8.7.6. Con: Income redistribution provides the greatest good for the greatest number by taking wealth from those who need it least and giving it to those who it will benefit most.
1.1.8.7.6.1. Con: Income redistribution is fundamentally unjust, and simply theft, by a different name. It requires a class of elites to act as judge over the rest of the populace, with arbitrary values like "need" as there only standards
1.1.8.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.3.1.
1.1.9. Con: The state has no moral obligations.
1.1.9.1. Con: This is not the case in a Democracy. In America, the state has the moral obligations of a super-majority of citizens \(Constitutional majority\).
1.1.9.1.1. Con: In America, the state has the legal obligation to enforce its constitution, its laws, and to propagate the things necessary to remain as a state like preventing hostile foreign powers from invading and harming its citizens and by enforcing the natural laws of the country. Not a moral obligation.
1.1.9.1.2. Con: The obligation a state has to its citizens in a democracy is not a moral one, it is a legal one.
1.1.9.2. Pro: The state may not have moral obligations yet the state is the instrument of the people. If people want welfare, then the state must provide it.
1.1.9.2.1. Con: The state is an instrument of the people but not the only instrument of the people. If the people want to help the poor, they do not need the state to provide it.
1.1.9.3. Con: The State has the moral and legal obligation to take care of its citizens.
1.1.9.3.1. Pro: Every citizen has a right to clean food, water, shelter and internet which the state has a moral obligation to fulfill.
1.1.9.4. Con: [Catholic Social Teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rerum_novarum) tells us that the state has the moral obligation to protect human dignity and promote the common good.
1.1.9.4.1. Con: Most liberal democracies favour the [separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state) of church and state, are [secular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_state) and/or do not endorse an official religion, therefore most governments do not have a mandate that steams from Catholicism.
1.1.9.5. Con: The "state" is neither moral nor immoral.  The people possess morality \(or a lack thereof\).  Rather than look to the state to provide this or that for moral purposes, we should be looking within ourselves and those around us to provide for those who cannot provide for themselves.  The state is not responsible for morality - the people are.
1.1.9.6. Con: The government has the obligation to respond to its citizens, on basic human rights and by what its citizens perceive as rights for the taxes they pay and for what types of candidates and the platform they present on elections and get chosen. Democracy has it flaws, but is one of the best systems out there.
1.1.10. Con: Equality is not the reason for welfare. Welfare is meant to serve as a safety net, not a ladder.
1.1.10.1. Con: The people who implement welfare can do it for any reason they want.
1.1.10.2. Con: Welfare intends to protect all people from the broader impact that inequality has on a few.
1.1.11. Con: Whenever people are left free to make their own choices, inequality will always arise – thus inequality will eventually exist in any free system.
1.1.11.1. Con: Inequality shouldn't strip people of their rights.
1.1.11.2. Con: The state exists only because the people consent to government. If the people don't consent to inequality then the legitimacy of government is undermined.
1.1.12. Pro: There are institutional injustices in the system that create an unequal playing ground for citizens. Welfare helps to even things out.
1.1.12.1. Pro: A state that legalises the private ownership, which is to say the possibility to accumulate tons of products while letting your neighbour without anything, as well as the ability to take someone else's added value through companies and entrepreneurship, thus creating inequality, has the moral obligation to help those who are left behind.
1.1.12.2. Pro: Technology improvements and the concentration of political, social, and economic power is increasing inequality, and pushing people to marginals positions in the socio-economic system.
1.1.13. Pro: A society is just when it is as equal as possible.
1.1.13.1. Pro: [John Rawls's Theory of Justice](http://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/ethics/matrawls.htm#op) puts forth the idea that a just society must be constructed so that a rational individual would accept citizenship even with the possibility of occupying the most disadvantaged position in that society.
1.1.14. Con: There is no greater inequality than between people vs the state.
1.1.14.1. Con: The people collectively legitimise and consent to the state through participating in e.g. elections. Consent corrects inequalities.
1.1.15. Con: The state has an obligation to allow freedom of competition which inevitably leads to inequality. The state is only obliged to "fight" criminality and not all inequality is caused by criminality.
1.1.15.1. Con: An obligation to promote competition is not a necessary role of the state.
1.1.15.2. Pro: At best, the state would have to choose a very narrow scope of inequality to combat, as there is such a vast range of inequalities in the world. This means the state would be unequally fighting inequality, which would be, and is under the current models,  fruitless.
1.1.16. Con: Equality and inequality are two sides of the same coin. You can't have equality of outcome without inequality of opportunity, and vice-versa.
1.1.16.1. Con: Less equality of income leads to less equality of opportunity, as poor children are denied access to high quality healthcare and education
1.1.17. Pro: Money is power, and an unequal distribution of money thus means an unequal distribution of power
1.1.17.1. Con: There are more efficient ways to address an inequality of political power than to attempt to reduce economic inequality. \(For example, expanded public funding of elections would be far less costly than implementing or significantly expanding a welfare state\).
1.1.17.1.1. Con: From an economic perspective, reducing economic inequality is more than efficient – it is downright profitable \(source: [www.economist.com](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2015/06/15/how-inequality-affects-growth) \)
1.1.17.1.2. Con: Those other means are unlikely to be implemented or to stay implemented as long as there is great economic inequality.
1.1.17.2. Con: Unequal distribution of power is a good thing. Unequal distribution of ability is unavoidable, and having the power in the hands of those that are successful at managing it is preferable to equality of power, regardless of ability.
1.1.17.2.1. Con: "Being successful at managing power" in this case means "being successful at inheriting or otherwise acquiring and keeping wealth", not "being able to use power fairly or ethically".
1.1.17.3. Pro: Preventing power from concentrating in too few people, is an important part of preventing tyranny.
1.1.17.4. Pro: An unequal distribution of power means society changes for the good of those few in power, at the cost of everyone else.
1.1.17.5. Pro: The American political system is a good example of this. Solid democratic institutions, hijacked by the interests of the few and wealthy.
1.1.17.5.1. Con: Economic inequality is not the only possible explanation, and may not be the most important one.
1.1.17.5.2. Pro: A statistical analysis, based on 1,779 policy issues, and published in a peer reviewed [article](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf), shows: "When the preferences of economic elites and the stands of organized interest groups are controlled for, the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy" and "the net alignments of the most influential, business-oriented groups are negatively related to the average citizen’s wishes."
1.1.18. Con: It's impossible to protect individual liberty and equality simultaneously. People's intrinsic right to liberty can't be stripped in the promotion of equality.
1.1.18.1. Con: It is impossible to protect individual liberty without protecting equality of opportunity. Societies without equality of opportunity only provide genuine liberty for those on top.
1.1.18.2. Con: The welfare states that are in place in modern liberal democracies are designed to ensure equality of opportunity, not outcome.
1.2. Pro: The welfare state is inefficient.
1.2.1. Con: The efficiency of the 'welfare state' is highly subjective.  Yet, any inefficiency in the 'welfare state' hasn't prevented it from doing good and, in general, most people believe welfare programs are more valuable than any negatives resulting from 'inefficiency' \(percieved or actual\).
1.2.2. Pro: Including a welfare arm expands the scope of government. This makes it more difficult for voters to be well informed about all issues pertaining to the state, creating additional opportunities for corruption and weakening overall \(informed\) consent of the governed.
1.2.3. Pro: A centralized system is expected to be less efficient than a market solution, because of the lack in competition. The issue of poverty is for most people very important. Therefore it shouldn't be solved by a centralized system.
1.2.3.1. Pro: There should be no welfare state because implementing anything, including charity, via a government bureaucracy is inherently inefficient. Taking away the welfare state wouldn't remove welfare, it would just move it into the more efficient and more caring private non-profit charities. This would allow for more innovation in the distribution of charity.
1.2.3.2. Con: US programs are proven to work and [reduce poverty](https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/nov/12/social-welfare-programs-food-stamps-reduce-poverty-america), according to research.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: [Research](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2014/10/28/how-the-safety-net-cuts-poverty-rates) in the US supports that without welfare, the poverty rate among senior citizens would be more than 50% instead of being just 14.6 %.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Food stamps cut the [poverty](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2014/10/28/how-the-safety-net-cuts-poverty-rates) rate by about 10% and  reduce poverty among minors even more.
1.2.3.2.3. Pro: [Refundable tax credits](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2014/10/28/how-the-safety-net-cuts-poverty-rates), which help the working poor, reduce the poverty rate among children by more than a quarter.
1.2.3.2.4. Con: Trump’s Tax Reform [benefits](https://www.vox.com/2017/12/20/16790040/gop-tax-bill-winners) large corporations and is likely to increase income ineguality. The [rich](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tax-plan-rich-people-benefits-2017-11?IR=T) are getting richer, the poor poorer.
1.2.3.3. Con: The huge amounts of [money and resources](https://www.thebalance.com/welfare-programs-definition-and-list-3305759) and the high number of recipients of welfare would make a private solution almost impossible to finance and manage.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Additionally, private companies and charities may devote money to what gives them tax breaks or has better appeal at rising money, but without a centralized effort, many welfare areas \(and those who rely on them\) can be left behind.
1.2.3.4. Con: Decentralized systems preceeded the government.  They were lawless, violent brutal, and bad for markets [\(Beaud, p. 178\)](https://books.google.com/books?id=X-BWCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=american+capitalism+1500&source=bl&ots=EMG4W4mU0s&sig=BoMMPLc11bLlTDMntK6emXc-8u4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiArvqP1bDXAhWF4CYKHSQQBycQ6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&q=american%20capitalism%201500&f=false).
1.2.3.5. Pro: 70% of money in the welfare spending is kept in by the government in the US according to the [Cato institute.](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-handbook-policymakers/1995/9/104-18.pdf)
1.2.3.5.1. Con: The Cato Institute is an American libertarian think tank  founded as the [Charles Koch](https://www.thenation.com/article/independent-and-principled-behind-cato-myth/) Foundation which ideology is defined as '[market liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute)' and may be subject to [conservative](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cato-institute/) bias.
1.2.3.5.1.1. Pro: Scholars and professionals related to the Cato institute have [described](https://www.thenation.com/article/independent-and-principled-behind-cato-myth/) the Koch brothers as "venal Republican Party warmongers out to crush the Cato Institute’s nonpartisan and independent scholarship".
1.2.3.5.1.2. Con: Some fact-checkers consider Cato's factual reporting as "[high](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cato-institute/)".
1.2.3.5.1.3. Pro: The Cato Institute has been linked monetarily and ideologically with the US Republican Party, putting in questions its claimed [independence](https://www.thenation.com/article/independent-and-principled-behind-cato-myth/).
1.2.3.5.2. Con: The paper of the Cato instute was written in 1994 and could be outdated.
1.2.3.6. Pro: Man does not possess the cognitive capacity to compute the needs of others. Thus, socialism can only result in shortages and overproduction. In contrast, however imperfect the outcome might be, decentralizing decision making to be present on an individual level creates the best possible analysis of the societal demand, and therefore also the best possible supply of goods and services.
1.2.3.7. Pro: There is no such natural state that will create an equal outcome among anything in the universe. Hence, empowering the state to fight against "inequality" is like giving someone a sword to fight against the ocean. Any socialist government will therefore only result in an ever expanding colossus, which confiscate more and more resources.
1.2.3.7.1. Con: The idea that a socialist government will continue to devote ever-increasing resources to inequality simply because inequality persists, is unsupported. Most current socialist governments' welfare systems try to establish reasonable living standards for the poor, not equal living standards to the rich.
1.2.3.7.2. Con: The idea is that while a battle cannot be won, it needs to be fought. To continue with maritime analogies, a man in a leaky boat should be encouraged to keep bailing water.
1.2.3.8. Con: That's only true if there's unlimited money. However, if there's is a finite amount of money, then the last thing you want to do is waste it having people compete, or run services in competition to each other.
1.2.3.8.1. Pro: For example, the US has only one army, not more than one competing to see which is better at fighting wars. There is still competition at the stage of building planes or tanks, yet not multiple armies.
1.2.3.9. Con: There is no incentive to solve poverty in capitalism -- the "competition" referred to is driven by efficiency in profit rather than efficiency in improving quality of life.
1.2.3.9.1. Con: Incentives are subjective. If people want to help the poor, capitalism will solve the problem efficiently. Without a culture of people wanting to help the poor, no system will work in the long run. In that case even a social democracy would not solve it. Because if people didn't want to help the poor, the welfare state would become abolished by elections.
1.2.3.9.2. Con: Keeping people poor reduces the buying power of consumers and thus the profits that a company can make.
1.2.3.9.3. Con: The are a number of capitalist institutions that do not act solely to maxamise profits. Social enterprises, co-operatives, non-for-profits all act with a broader aim but still within a capitalist structure.
1.2.3.9.4. Con: The "profit maximisation" agenda was only introduced in recent decades and is not necessary for a definition of capitalism. Today, there are many directors of privately and publicly held companies who have never signed articles requiring that they maximise profits \(i.e it is not codified\)
1.2.3.10. Con: In practice market solutions are not efficient at solving poverty since the government always interferes at some level. Powerful elites use such [intervention](https://deanbaker.net/books/the-conservative-nanny-state.htm) to enact policy that causes upward wealth distribution and thus poverty and the need for a welfare state.
1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.3.
1.2.5. Pro: Charity is a better way to fight poverty.
1.2.5.1. Con: Charity can discriminate due to the beliefs of the charity in question. For example a religious charity may not help LGBT people in the same way it helps heterosexuals, or may not wish to help people of other faiths.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: Sure, it can. But there is nothing to prevent a competing non-discriminating charity from emerging. Indeed since many people believe in equal rights for all individuals including LGBT and people of any faith, donors are very likely to demand such charities into existence on the philanthropic "free market".
1.2.5.2. Con: Both welfare and charity can coexist.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: A welfare system, for example, does not decrease the participation in charity, according to [research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16301115).
1.2.5.3. Con: Many charities have large administrative costs and are run very inefficiently - the same problems many people have with government systems, but without the ability for citizens to directly impact them.
1.2.5.4. Con: Charity assumes that the interest of a few must always be the same as the interest of all.  This is false.
1.2.5.5. Con: Charity might not be distributed in the same manner as the welfare state would.

In the [UK for instance](http://www.npt-uk.org/philanthropic-resources/uk-charitable-giving-statistics) - animal welfare gets about as many donations as donations towards young children.
1.2.5.5.1. Con: Current donations are skewed towards less worthy causes because people reasonably assume that the welfare state will take care of people, whereas animal welfare depends on charitable donations.
1.2.5.5.2. Con: Charity can discriminate between the deserving and the undeserving poor. Some people are in need despite their best efforts, and through no fault of their own, so they only need temporary monetary support. Others may have caused their predicament but are repentant; they need money and some supervision. Still others are unwilling to learn from the consequences of their bad decisions; these people cannot be helped with money - in fact, enabling them to continue would make things worse.
1.2.5.5.2.1. Con: Welfare programs with strict rules and time limitations are better equipped to make that distinction than charity organisations.
1.2.5.5.2.2. Con: No objective criteria exists for "deserving" vs. "undeserving" poverty.  Many types of "undeserving" poverty are the result of health problems that could happen to anyone.
1.2.5.5.2.2.1. Con: -> See discussion #2799: Health care should be voluntary and market provided, not mandatory, nor provided or regulated by government.
1.2.5.5.3. Con: There is no reason to assume that the distribution of government welfare is a better way to distribute.
1.2.5.6. Con: The state is what makes charity as effective as it is through its support. With a smaller state charities would be less effective thereby negating this argument.
1.2.5.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.5.
1.2.5.7. Pro: Since charity can be given or withheld, people cannot rely on it. Therefore, there is an incentive to work in order not to need charity. This is in contrast to the welfare state, where you have a legal claim to other people's money, and thus can rely on it, which offers no incentive to work yourself out of poverty.
1.2.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.3.8.1.
1.2.5.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.3.8.2.
1.2.5.8. Con: -> See 1.1.8.5.1.
1.2.5.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.5.2.
1.2.5.10. Con: Charity is an inefficient and ineffective method of redistribution of wealth to fight poverty. The numbers required to fight poverty aren't possible through the volunteering of funds. Charity as an alternative just suits people who don't want to pay money to either taxation or charity.
1.2.5.11. Con: Charity organisations cannot scale to deal with poverty that is not of a transitional or marginal nature. Only the welfare state can absorb the massive costs of \(for instance\) a national disability insurance scheme.
1.2.5.12. Con: Private charity is even more inefficient.
1.2.5.12.1. Pro: [Studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16301115) suggest that women, religious people and more educated individuals are more likely to actively participate in charities. That leaves a high number of population who not that likely to do so.
1.2.5.12.2. Pro: [Where the money goes](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/how-efficient-is-private-charity/) in a private charity system is a big question. How much of the donor's money goes to the actual issue they are seeking to ameliorate is highly dependent on the organization, and many people do not know this information about the charities they donate to.
1.2.5.12.3. Pro: Private charities do not always have access to the same infrastructure or resources government organizations do, and so their responses can be uneven, ad hoc, or completely insufficient to meet material needs.
1.2.5.12.4. Pro: Private charities rely on private donations, which are not often given with the full knowledge of a community's needs, or how the charity is run and organized. For instance, this has been talked about in relationship to food banks for some time, as noted here: [Stop Donating Canned Goods.](http://nationalpost.com/opinion/im-begging-you-stop-donating-canned-goods-to-food-banks)
1.2.5.12.5. Pro: Fund raising can also be an issue for private charities, especially in areas with competing non-profits. It costs money for these charities for raise money, as exemplified here: [The inefficient chase for funds](https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2005/10/31/story4.html)
1.2.5.12.6. Pro: There is no guarantee that a private donor will direct their charitable giving towards organizations or populations most in need.
1.2.5.12.6.1. Con: There is no guarantee that a centralized socialist government will direct tax payers money towards organizations or populations most in need.
1.2.5.12.6.1.1. Con: At least, a centralized government in a democracy has a mandate to look after all of its citizens. Private donors do not have that obligation.
1.2.5.12.6.2. Pro: A centralized government is more likely to have the tools, structure,  knowledge and global information to make sure which citizens or organization are the ones most in need.
1.2.5.12.6.2.1. Con: This flies in the face of Hayek's[local knowledge problem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_knowledge_problem). According to this, citizens themselves would be better equipped than a centralized government with the distributed knowledge and information about the various needs present throughout society.
1.2.6. Pro: Removal of barriers for an entry in to the labor market is way better to fight poverty in the long term. This way poor people start to accumulate their own wealth.
1.2.6.1. Con: [In most OECD countries](https://data.oecd.org/unemp/unemployment-rate.htm) unemployment is in the [desirable range](http://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262013635.001.0001/upso-9780262013635-chapter-6) of 3-5%. Entry into the labour market is not currently an issue, and efforts to reduce it more would be inflationary.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: The [Phillips Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve) shows that with decreases in unemployment inflation will rise because workers do have higher income.
1.2.6.2. Con: If there are more unemployed people than there are jobs available, it is mathematically impossible for everyone to enter the labor market. No matter how much the barriers of entry are lowered, there will still be unemployed individuals.
1.2.6.3. Con: The removal of barriers to entry does not fix problems like perpetual disenfranchisement. This can be resulting from lack of confidence in job seeking, alcoholism, drug abuse, and many other social problems. The free market doesn't solve the issues, as charities don't perform well without state support. Therefore to solve these issues a 'welfare state' needs to exist.
1.2.6.3.1. Con: Government grants to private charities create the well studied ["Crowding Out"](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15004.pdf)  effect, which decreases the amount of private donations.
1.2.6.3.2. Con: The US government spending and taxation rose [from 1965 to 2003](https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/wp/2007/2007-012.pdf) with a negative correlation to the donations to charities. A smaller government might cause more charity.
1.2.6.3.3. Con: The welfare state does not solve this issues, because it creates bad incentives for some individuals.
1.2.6.3.3.1. Pro: Guaranteed government checks undermine the ability of family and friends, as well as charities, to put on the pressure needed to enact change in those self-destructive individuals.
1.2.6.3.3.2. Pro: Charities create better incentives by withholding or conditioning their support individually.
1.2.6.3.3.3. Pro: Charities create better incentives, because of their responsibilities to its donors to succesfully help people out of poverty.
1.2.6.4. Con: The welfare state actually [improves](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/30/labour-welfare-state-economic-growth) entrepreneurship and economic growth, which are in and of themselves means to remove barriers of entry.
1.2.6.4.1. Con: Government programs which are designed subsidize start-up businesses are not generally considered "welfare".
1.2.6.4.1.1. Con: General welfare programs can allow a safety net that can make citizens  feel more confident riskying their time and economic recources to start their own business. If their venture fails, they know at least their basic necessities can be covered.
1.2.6.4.2. Pro: A strong welfare state provides a safety net that allows citizens to take more risks in their business ventures, which promotes entrepreneurialism.
1.2.6.4.2.1. Pro: High [taxation](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/why-does-sweden-produce-so-many-startups/) and Sweden’s social safety net means that entrepreneurs are more free to take risks.
1.2.6.4.3. Con: While welfare may have helped to bring about some businesses, the tax burden required to fund the welfare state has certainly quenched more enterprises than welfare programs promoted.
1.2.6.4.3.1. Con: Corporate tax is voluntary. If the price of incorporation outweighs its benefit then entrepreneurs need not incorporate
1.2.6.5. Con: The ability to work is not only dependant on willingliness, there are many other constrains like health \(people are injured daily in accidents or fall prey to diseases which are no fault of their own\) or personal circumstances, like going through a divorce, being between jobs or caring for an elderly parent, among many other number of reasons.
1.2.6.6. Pro: The problems with 'capitalism' as it currently exists arise due to government intervention not in spite of it. The problems of monopoly and monopsony only arise due to government enforced restrictions to free enterprise.
1.2.6.6.1. Con: There are many barriers to entry which are not government created or mandated, such as increasing returns to scale or network effects.
1.2.6.6.2. Con: It is highly unlikely that government restrictions like those precisely requiring [monopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law#Monopoly_and_power) to be broken up possibly lead to more monopolies being created.
1.2.7. Con: The absence of a welfare state increases poverty.
1.2.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Countries with big welfare states have less poverty.
1.2.7.2.1. Con: There is no consensus about that statement.[en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare%27s_effect_on_poverty)
1.2.7.2.1.1. Con: There seem to be some consensus among political and economical authors in Europe about the links between welfare state and poverty reduction. It is mainly in the [US](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare%27s_effect_on_poverty#) that that link is questioned.
1.2.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.4.2.
1.2.7.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.7.4.1.
1.2.7.2.2. Con: This is putting the cart before the horse. Wealthy countries can afford a big welfare state, at least for a few generations, while poor countries cannot. In order to be able to redistribute purchasing power, there have to be people creating massive surpluses that can be taken away and redistributed.
1.2.7.2.3. Pro: Most developed [countries](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/01/05/america_s_poor_vs_the_rest_of_the_world.html) that have less poor citizens at the bottom of the economic distribution also have [stronger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state#By_country) welfare states than the US.
1.2.7.3. Pro: Free enterprise leaves many people behind.
1.2.7.3.1. Con: The most successful countries \(i.e with lowest poverty levels\) use the wealth generated through capitalism by means of taxation to fund social programmes. Capitalist systems are historically proven as a means to reduce poverty and in the last [20 years the number of people who are in extreme poverty has almost halved thanks to capitalism](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21578665-nearly-1-billion-people-have-been-taken-out-extreme-poverty-20-years-world-should-aim).
1.2.7.3.2. Con: Private industry has an obligation to pay a living wage when it profits from goods and services its employees produce. Industry has way too much influence in setting wages and tying labor cost to reduced profits. The welfare state should have the ability to challenge the wages companies pay if they are not sufficient to maintain  basic needs, esecially when companies consistently make healthy profits. Employees should not need or qualify for welfare benefits because of low wages.
1.2.7.3.3. Pro: A welfare state provides a safety net to give people a second chance after severe difficulties.
1.2.7.3.3.1. Pro: Keeping people out of abject poverty is beneficial for the society -- and not offered by free market alternatives. It allows individuals to enter the workforce after a break \(instead of finding themselves homeless after a break, or too sick to be productive\) and allows people to go into training and education and thus be a more skilled workforce.
1.2.7.3.3.2. Pro: Many of those experiencing poverty, for instance the old or the very young, do so through no fault of their own and cannot change their circumstances by working. It is morally unacceptable to allow them to suffer or expect unreliable charity to provide for them.
1.2.7.3.3.3. Pro: People that live in poverty cannot invest in long-term development because their mind is occupied with short-term concerns. The welfare state seeks to provide in their short-term well-being and as such enables people to realize their potential.
1.2.7.3.3.3.1. Con: If it were true that having to take care of immediate concerns is what holds people back from becoming successful and the welfare state relieved that stress, we would expect to see only temporary use of welfare benefits. However, welfare dependency does exist in significant numbers.
1.2.7.3.4. Pro: Without welfare systems, people who are unable to get a job will have an extremely low quality of life. If there are more people unemployed than job openings, it will be inevitable that there are people in this situation.
1.2.7.3.4.1. Pro: During times of high unemployment many people will not have the means to support themselves and could end up living below the poverty line if the government does not assist them.
1.2.7.3.5. Con: Only people who are unwilling or unable to produce enough value to live comfortably would even be in danger of poverty. Those unwilling deserve to be poor, while those unable are so few that charity can undoubtedly take care of them.
1.2.7.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.2.
1.2.7.3.5.2. Con: Automation might increase the number of people that are unable to produce enough value.
1.2.7.3.5.2.1. Pro: With technological advancements, human workers are becoming obsolete. As this process takes place programs need to be in place to assist struggling families.
1.2.7.3.5.2.2. Pro: If a machine can provide goods and services more efficiently than a human worker, this represents a net good for society, and is responsible for dramatically increasing the availability of some goods/services. Automation is not negative, the need for people to "work or starve" under capitalism makes us fear losing human jobs. Wealth distribution systems would solve this problem.
1.2.7.3.5.2.3. Pro: As human labor becomes irrelevant, it is necessary to have a provision for the affected portion of society.
1.2.7.3.5.2.4. Con: There are no historical examples of automation making a larger portion of the population poorer in the long run. In fact, the opposite has always been the case.
1.2.7.3.5.2.4.1. Con: New types of automation, advanced robotics and artificial intelligence, could replace jobs in an unprecedented manner.  They are unlike anything seen before in their potential for adaptability and efficiency.
1.2.7.3.5.2.5. Con: Automation frees labor, so that it can be used to produce other things than it does now, and which are not produced at this time. Therefore, automation will increase total wealth, as long as people whose labor is freed put it to use in other ways.
1.2.7.3.5.3. Con: The right to basic provisions \(food, water, shelter\) shouldn't be dependent on the individual's ability to produce value for an economic entity. Thriving citizens should be the goal of their government, not thriving corporations.
1.2.7.3.6. Pro: -> See discussion #4751: Socialist Programs Are Necessary to Make Capitalism Sustainable.
1.2.7.3.7. Pro: -> See discussion #4066: Socialism is a better alternative to capitalism
1.2.7.3.8. Con: -> See discussion #2881: Capitalism is democratic.
1.2.7.3.9. Pro: Market forces alone cannot capture externalities. Consider Pigou's example of railway works and forest fires.
1.2.7.3.10. Pro: In 2016, [14%](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/acs/acsbr16-01.pdf) of the US citizens lived with an income below the poverty level. That means 45 million people are poor in one of the world’s [richest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)#Lists) countries.
1.2.7.3.10.1. Con: "Poor" in the US actually means a very comfortable lifestyle when compared to the rest of the world today, or even to the rich of past eras. Relative poverty can never be eliminated except maybe by the most repressive and totalitarian governments.
1.2.7.3.10.1.1. Con: However, when comparing US poverty throughout the bottom of the economic distribution with other developed countries, poor people in the US still fare way [worse](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/01/05/america_s_poor_vs_the_rest_of_the_world.html).
1.2.7.3.10.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.2.3.
1.2.7.3.11. Con: Free enterprise is the freedom to be enterprising and the freedom to start a business and be independent, it is also therewith the freedom to be able to help people \(i.e. by offering them a job\). There can be no wealth in society whatsoever without enterprise.
1.2.7.3.12. Con: Free enterprises are made by free people who are interested in it, anyone that may be "left behind" just has chosen not to work on it, and that is ok, people have the right to choose, the only thing necessary are options.
1.2.7.3.12.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.2.
1.2.7.3.12.2. Con: -> See 1.2.7.3.3.1.
1.2.7.3.12.3. Con: You can be "left behind" by a free enterprise by arriving too late or not being the absolute best. It can be the case that neither is the fault of the individual.
Being "left behind" is not only the result of having 'opted out', it is also being competed out.
1.2.7.3.12.4. Con: "Free enterprise" is a 'winner takes all' situation, where being better than someone by a 'hair's breadth' \(figuratively speaking\) affords you all the prizes of that minor advantage, and the near-identical competitor faces failure.
This is true at applicant level \(recruitment\) and at enterprise level \(think: Google Vs Ask Jeeves\).
1.2.7.3.13. Pro: Markets are nearly blind to human suffering while politicians are not. Therefore, it is necessary to give them the tools to fight it.
1.2.7.3.14. Con: The welfare state should be the primary focus of the government, including healthcare, care for the elderly, development of deprived areas, along with national infrastructure. Otherwise the ruling class is only serving commercial interests and that would leave a large section of society with nothing to gain from voting in a democracy.
1.2.7.3.14.1. Con: The 'ruling class' does not only serve commercial interests. They engage in many charitable/altruistic projects as well. In fact, all of [the world's top philanthropists](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/the-20-most-generous-people-in-the-world-a6757046.html) are wealthy individuals.
1.2.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.5.1.
1.2.7.5. Con: There is some chicken-or-egg here. One might argue a welfare state leads to less poverty, but another would argue welfare states are a luxury only affordable by wealthy countries.
1.2.8. Con: The welfare state can be beneficial when endogenous circumstances make large numbers of people unemployable.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Depends of the societal model. If the society has less opportunity for labor, despite having means of production to be used, social programs are necessary and beneficial for the economy by increasing overall purchasing power in favor of capitalists.
1.2.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.3.5.2.
1.2.9. Con: Efficiency is not the only standard one can use to determine the right or wrong course for a nation, so simple inefficiency is not sufficient reason to reject the possible benefits of a welfare state.
1.2.9.1. Pro: Any inefficiencies in welfare programs, perceived or actual, do not undermine the need or value of these programs.
1.2.9.2. Con: Whilst efficiency may not be the only way, it is an important factor in considering how and if you have ensured effective rebalance of inequality. For instance, an efficient system is likely less corrupt.
1.2.9.3. Pro: The [maximin criterion](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/#ArgMaxCriTJSec262) suggests that the best course is the one in which the worst outcome is better than the worst outcome in all alternatives.
1.2.9.3.1. Pro: "The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering the prisons" - Fyodor Dostoyevsky
1.2.9.4. Pro: Quality measures outside efficiency are also valid and powerful reasons to keep welfare.
1.2.9.4.1. Pro: People in countries with strong welfare \(Denmark, Norway, and [Sweden](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Sweden/United-States)\) live [longer](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Sweden/United-States/Health) than people in America, they earn more, they do not have student [debt](http://www.eenee.de/eeneeHome/EENEE/Policy-Briefs.html), and they have [better](http://nordic.businessinsider.com/the-nordics-have-the-best-pension-systems-2016-10/) [retirement](http://nordic.businessinsider.com/norway-is-the-best-country-in-the-world-to-retire-2016-7/) benefits.
1.2.9.4.1.1. Con: There are many more factors in play that decide whether Denmark, Norway and Sweden are considered successful and are not necessarily tied to them being a welfare state.
1.2.9.4.1.1.1. Pro: Low corruption, deregulation and budget self-restraint with cuts also explains Sweden’s good and innovative [economy](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/why-sweden-beats-most-other-countries-at-just-about-everything/).
1.2.9.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Gender equality, good reputation, a high quality education system \(than excels in foreign languages\) as well as income security and good pensions, all factors linked to a [Nordic welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model) model, are also [reasons](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/why-sweden-beats-most-other-countries-at-just-about-everything/) for Sweden's success.
1.2.9.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Start-ups and an innovative economy have also been possible thanks to big investments from the [government](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/why-does-sweden-produce-so-many-startups/) to allow fast internet access almost everywhere.
1.2.9.4.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.2.1.
1.2.9.4.1.1.2. Con: However, most of the factors quoted, healthcare, student debt or retirement are necessarily tied to welfare.
1.2.9.4.1.2. Con: The reduction in "life expectancy" in the US is not related to welfare, but [drug abuse](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/19/health/opioids-life-expectancy-study/index.html) \(both legal and illegal\) as noted in [several](https://interface.williamjames.edu/topic/substance-abuse-addictions) [research](http://dailyfreepress.com/2017/09/26/recent-study-attributes-national-drop-in-life-expectancy-to-opioid-overdose/) papers.
1.2.9.4.1.2.1. Con: One of the goals of welfare policies is to prevent and combat social risks. Drug abuse is a social problem that could be diminished by investments in free education, free health, activisation of free time policies etc. Scandinavian countries also face the drug-use problem, but instead of impridonment, they provide free assistance, rehab centers, etc
1.2.9.4.1.2.2. Con: People in other countries also abuse drugs and alcohol and comparative [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4112220/) has concluded that "Americans lead shorter and less healthy lives than people in other high-income countries" and while "multiple causes are implicated, crucial differences in social policy might underlie an important part of the US health disadvantage".
1.2.9.4.1.3. Pro: According to [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4112220/), Americans have shorter and less healthy lives than people in other high-income countries due to different factors, yet "crucial differences in social policy might underlie an important part of the US health disadvantage".
1.2.9.4.1.4. Pro: Countries with social safety nets have an overall higher level of health of their citizens in terms of life expectancy and incidence of chronic illness. Healthy people increase productivity, and are less of a burden on society as a whole.   [The American Healthcare Paradox \(Book\)](http://bioethicsjournal.hms.harvard.edu/autumn-2017/american-health-care-paradox)
1.2.9.4.1.5. Pro: There are four Scandinavian countries in the top seven in the studies done by The [Legantum Prosperity Index](http://www.prosperity.com/rankings).
1.2.9.4.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.5.
1.2.10. Con: The welfare state is indeed inefficient. But having no welfare state is even less efficient.
1.2.10.1. Pro: Even if government bureaucracy is inefficient, abolishing the social welfare state without replacement, essentially  throws people to the streets and to their own devices, not caring what happens to them. That is not the mark of a civilized society
1.2.10.2. Pro: In the U.S health services are much more [expensive](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/health-spending-u-s-compare-countries/#item-start) and less good than in other first world [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita).
1.2.10.2.1. Pro: In America where a record number of people lose their homes or suffer insurmountable debts due to situations outside of their control. The insurance companies would have you believe that competition improves costs, but Americans pay twice the amount that governments pay for the same service in Europe. Nobody can seriously defend American health insurance costs - they do so for political reasons not economic.
1.2.11. Con: -> See 1.2.5.12.
1.2.12. Con: Some forms of welfare also include private market actors and some forms are considered efficient or, at least, efficient enough to fulfill their goals.
1.2.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.4.6.2.
1.3. Pro: The welfare state hurts the economy.
1.3.1. Con: Providing a welfare state allows people to leave positions that are harmful and detrimental to their long term health.
1.3.2. Con: Having a welfare state provides a minimum 'cost' of employment, by forcing employers to pay more than someone could make by not working at all.
1.3.3. Pro: A welfare state would means the state would be handling more money, the more money the state got the higher chance it has of becoming more corrupt
1.3.3.1. Pro: Politicians might choose to take some of the budget money meant for welfare for other programs/budgets instead or even decide to give themselves higher salaries.
1.3.4. Pro: No social system means no social security payments, which in turn create more incentive to hire workers rather than relying on machinery.
1.3.4.1. Con: In situations where machines replace humans, they are often orders of magnitude more efficient. Reducing the cost of hiring employees by some percentage is unlikely to significantly impact the adoption of machines.
1.3.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.7.3.5.2.2.
1.3.4.3. Con: Those machines need to be designed, programmed, tested, built, installed, supervised, maintained and eventually improved upon and replaced by human workers.
1.3.5. Con: By providing income support and unemployment support then even those who are struggling in terms of income are able to feed their families. This helps to stimulate the local retail economy which in turn gets fed back to the community.
1.3.6. Con: A populace with money in their pockets stimulates an economy which is in a rut: supply creates its own demand.
1.3.7. Pro: Welfare does not incentivize labor. Labor should be incentivized.
1.3.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.7.3.2.
1.3.7.2. Con: There are many incentive schemes possible under welfare state. Incentivizing labor is not inherently at odds with the principles of a welfare state.
1.3.7.3. Con: In a free market, each individual chooses how much to work based on supply and demand.  Forced labor is illegal and ethically wrong.  As technology, productivity and efficiency  lower production costs, the same standard of living can be maintained with less work.  No incentive can force people to work.
1.3.7.4. Con: Starting to build up experience in a line or work or enterprise is inherently risky and risk is a disincentive. Therefore the presence of welfare incentivises people to work.
1.3.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.3.10.
1.3.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.3.11.
1.3.8. Con: In an era of rising human labor productivity through advances in computing/automation, we absolutely have the means to support a welfare state.
1.3.9. Con: The welfare state ensures that excess wealth, generated by workers, is kept in circulation to benefit society and not in the possession of a shrinking group of wealthy individuals who have no obligation in improving society.
1.3.10. Con: Healthy, educated people contribute better to the economy.
1.3.10.1. Pro: Having a bad job \(E.G abusive bosses\) is more harmful [than having no job at all](http://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/why-having-a-bad-job-is-worse-for-your-health-than-having-no-job-at-all).
1.3.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.4.1.4.
1.3.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.
1.3.11. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.
1.3.12. Con: The welfare state is an alternative to emergency room visits, property crimes and crimes against people.  A state that pays for healthcare, education and the safety of the elderly and disabled is more cost effective than a police / prison state.
1.3.12.1. Pro: The cost of welfare is significantly less than the costs of not providing welfare for the economy.
1.3.12.1.1. Pro: This assumption \(the welfare hurts the economy\) has been thoroughly disproved. The economic cost of welfare is disproportionately small compared to the cost of its absence. Increased crime, poverty, homelessness, drug abuse, are the obvious increased costs, it also further undermines the economy as it has a negative impact on commercial revenue across a swathe of industries.
1.3.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.4.
1.3.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.2.
1.3.12.4. Pro: While research shows that a 10% increase in high school graduation rates results in a 9% decline in crime, in the last decades the US budget for the [correction system](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-us-spending-on-prisons-grew-at-three-times-rate-of-school-spending-report-2016-7) have risen dramatically \(from $17 to [$81 billion](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/money.html)\) and funding for education has remained flat or in some cases decreased.
1.3.12.4.1. Pro: The US [murder rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#United_States) \(4,88\) are higher than most high income countries, its spending in [policing](http://www.heuni.fi/material/attachments/heuni/papers/6KtlkZMtL/HEUNI_papers_20.pdf) per capital is considerably high and yet countries with higher spending in [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_spending_on_education_\(%25_of_GDP\)) and less spending in policing \(like Denmark, Belgium, Australia or Sweden\) have lower murder rates.
1.3.12.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.4.1.4.
1.3.13. Pro: The welfare state may make countries apply stronger rules for migrant workers to avoid fraud and abuse therefore hurting foreign workers' ability to acquire wealth.
1.3.13.1. Con: This is a fake paradox. Helping foreign workers should not forbid us from helping poor people. Both are important.
1.3.13.2. Con: Welfare can be and is different for different categories of residents. E.g. in [Germany](https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/germany/working/unemployment/unemployment-benefits) only certain categories of foreign residents can apply for unemployment and other benefits, in Sweden, Denmark and [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Scotland#Higher_Education_in_Scotland) universities are [free](https://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/studying-abroad/where-can-you-study-abroad-free) of tuition fee for nationals or EU/EEA students, but international students have to pay quite a lot.
1.3.14. Con: We are born for life, not to be economical entities only. Not everyone gets the same talents at birth and may need support at some point in life. Insurance is based on this principle. No welfare support lead to a lower standard society.
1.4. Con: The state has a moral obligation to fight poverty.
1.4.1. Pro: Government was naturally instituted for the well-being of its citizens.  The entire point of government is to look after the welfare of its people, and thus, if those people are economically constrained it belongs to the role of government to take action and fix the situation.
1.4.2. Pro: Governments are founded on ethical models not economic models, Capitalism only claims to efficiently distribute resources not dictate right from wrong. Setting a minimum standard of living for those who are unable or even unwilling to engage with the economic system is the ethically right thing to do rather than leaving them to suffer or even starve.
1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.
1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.4.5. Pro: The state has a moral obligation to provide for the basic needs of its citizens. Perhaps  the welfare state could be reformed and curtailed to more specifically fit this purpose, instead of abolished.
1.4.6. Pro: With a little thought, all of us must be able to imagine a situation where we ourselves would be needing support financially and unable to get it from elsewhere. That support if it is to be guaranteed, fair, and the costs evenly spread must come from government.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Welfare state reduce fear among individuals in society
1.4.7. Pro: [Welfare](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2017/05/09/is-there-enough-redistribution/) funds prevent poor people from dying. Diminishing [marginal utility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134519/) dictates that saving lives is worth more than possible revenue growth.
1.4.7.1. Con: Most of the [wealthiest](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/opinion/how-did-the-democrats-become-favorites-of-the-rich.html) places in the U.S. are solidly democratic and in favor of welfare.
1.4.8. Con: The welfare system creates dependence on the government. Poverty should be combated by helping people find work and become self-sufficient, as opposed to simply giving them money, which allows them to contribute nothing to their society, living on the government’s money forever. As more and more people become dependent on the government, it will eventually collapse under the burden.
1.4.9. Con: [Capitalism](https://www.heritage.org/international-economies/report/2017-index-economic-freedom-trade-and-prosperity-risk) \(free trade\) is the best way to fight poverty.
1.4.9.1. Con: All people want to have money. People who have a lot of money also have a tool for consolidating their position and gaining more money through investment – the result is, all else being equal, steadily increasing inequality.
1.4.9.1.1. Con: Inequality is not the same thing as poverty. The claim does not argue the point that capitalism fights poverty, only that it might result in inequality.
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.6. Con: The welfare state is necessary to sustain the system.
1.6.1. Pro: History has proven the necessity of a welfare state.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Most civilizations in human history have required welfare to prevent [popular](http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Wat-Tyler-the-Peasants-Revolt/) [revolts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcellions) [and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_the_Copper_Hand#cite_ref-ODB_1-3) [uprisings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquerie). Sumerian and Mesopotamian [rulers](https://books.google.com/books?id=lliTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT536&lpg=PT536&dq=hubullum+masaum&source=bl&ots=KLRVkhZZh-&sig=Vc-uWHtn4ACCEE1uoy4MwQyVysI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWwcnB97TXAhVIrlQKHWBHDNgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false) issued cyclic washing away of debts called "Hubullum Masa'um". [Rome](https://fee.org/articles/poor-relief-in-ancient-rome/) required hand-outs of bread to poor Romans when conquest was insufficient called the "Cura Annonae". The [Byzantines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanos_I_Lekapenos) raised taxes on rich while preventing poor families from selling themselves into debt bondage. The [US](http://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-14-3-a-how-welfare-began-in-the-united-states.html) established welfare when the country was in the throes of the Great Depression.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Through history, there was always a necessity of the state maintenancing the market  economically and structurally. It happened in 1929 and in 2008, as well. As capitalism crisis happen often, the state act as lifesaver trough [injecting trillions](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/business/economy/19fed.html) from the treasury in the market. That happedend similarly in [1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929), trough [Roosevelt](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/america-1918-1939/the-new-deal/) reforms.
1.6.1.3. Pro: When economies transition \(from industrial to information for example\) subsidies and resources for displaced workers are needed to keep them competitive. Especially in market economies, social safety nets are absolutely important.
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.5.1.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.3.5.2.
1.6.4. Pro: Capitalism incentivizes predatory economic practices. Welfare is a check on unbridled markets.
1.6.4.1. Pro: The market, by definition, is an irrational and inherently inefficent entity \(because it wastes energies and resources in competition\) that rewards behaviours that are not necessarily good for the society, while the wellbeing of individuals and communities is the ultimate goal of the state.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Markets fail and have inefficiencies only the state can manage in a manner that prevents unnecessary human suffering.
1.6.4.3. Pro: The welfare state includes unemployment insurance. Gutting programs like this gives workers less bargaining power and grants employers much greater control over people's lives.
1.6.5. Pro: Welfare is a form of insurance for society
1.6.5.1. Pro: The more you regulate society the less likely you allow abnormal events from affecting it. For example, in a pure capitalist society nothing protects you from becoming obsolete especially if don't see it coming. The Welfare state protects you by giving you time to adapt to changing conditions.
1.6.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.3.
1.6.5.3. Pro: The state should, at the very least, provide for those who can't provide for themselves : orphans, disabled, unemployed... There can be no freedom for these people without some kind of  exterior help.
1.6.5.3.1. Con: Just because the state doesn't intervene doesn't mean there won't be help for people in difficult circumstances. People can turn to family, friends, generous strangers and relevant organizations in the non-profit/philanthropic sector when they are in need.
1.6.5.3.1.1. Con: The key difference is that the state has a structure and budget and it is mandated by law to help. Making those in absolute need rely on the conditional prospect of help \(from family, strangers or the private sector\) is likely to be insufficient.
1.6.6. Pro: The welfare state could stimulate the economy through government spending in times of economic difficulty.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Welfare state has democratized the markets, expanding demand for goods, thus boosting the economy and promoting production
1.6.6.2. Pro: The welfare state has Keynesian stabilizing effects during recessions. Providing more stimulus automatically during recessions.
1.6.6.3. Pro: Programs like [SNAP](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap) provide money to the poor that they immediately spend, helping drive the economy. Cutting these payments will significantly decrease the poor and lower middle class's ability to spend, thus creating less demand, and thus hurting the economy.
1.6.7. Con: Without a welfare state, the limit would be on keeping trust, order, peace and civility. It is clearly seen by the governments monopoly on violence. There might be other organisations better suited to establish whatever additional needs required by the public.
1.6.7.1. Con: Other systems  will indeed find a way. Based on the experience of Victorian England they will include the following: Debtors prisons, poor houses, the Irish famine, petty stealing leading to prison overcrowding resulting in poor people sent to Australia, a considerably worse life expectancy for the poor, alcoholism increases on a massive scale, riots, a 'dickensian' nightmare as it is now known.
1.6.7.2. Con: In countries such as Russia where the welfare state has been dramatically reduced in scope, this rebalancing of power has not occurred.
1.6.7.3. Con: Welfare can be more effective if it isn't under governmental control.  Privatized welfare will alleviate many of the abuses associated with it, and in the long run will be more effective and less costly.  Privatized welfare would promote exchange of services, and reduce the need for monetary exchange \(people helping people, and exchanging ideas to uplift those who need help\).  Gofundme is a good example of welfare assistance functioning outside of the governmental entity.
1.6.7.3.1. Con: Since the outcomes of charitable giving in general and GoFundMe campaigns in particular are heavily dependent on the emotional state of the giver at the time the gift is made, such giving is highly susceptible to media frenzies and good storytelling, not the actual needs of potential recipients of charity.
1.6.7.3.2. Con: Some individual needs must be met at an equal minimum level across the entire society, because failure to meet these needs is individually catastrophic. Leaving basic social needs to the free market means that some individuals would fail to meet those minimum needs and thus be subject to undue suffering. The GoFundMe example does not work for an individual without internet access or contact with wealthier friends. That individual should not suffer or die for lack of those things.
1.6.8. Pro: Welfare encourages stability and respect for the social contract.
1.6.8.1. Pro: All of the world's most successful societies have always been defined by a high degree of social mobility, and social constructs to provide feedback against the negative outcomes of generational poverty and destitution. These social constructs make societies more stable and enhance the general state of peace and prosperity in society.
1.6.9. Pro: Welfare is necessary to uphold democracy.
1.6.9.1. Con: In a constitutionally limited republic, people do not adopt programs simply because a majority believe they are necessary.
1.6.9.1.1. Pro: A majority of people believed slavery to be necessary but it was was deemed unconstitutional and overruled nonetheless.
1.6.9.1.2. Pro: A majority people \(or lawmakers\) believed the [Defense of Marriage Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act) \(or [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8_\(2008\))\) was necessary but it was deemed unconstitutional and overruled nonetheless.
1.6.9.1.2.1. Con: In many democracies, the Constitution remains the highest law, one that sets the basis framework and is agreed upon by all citizens, therefore, even if a majority of lawmakers believed a program or a law was necessary, it cannot be approved or maintained if it contradicts the Constitution which represents the bigger majority.
1.6.9.1.2.2. Con: Societies change and evolve and therefore laws change accordingly. At some point, there may not be a sufficient political and social majority to pass a bill or implement a program, yet that is subject to change with time.
1.6.9.1.2.2.1. Pro: [Public opinion](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/) on social issues changes: the perception on same-sex marriage has completely shifted in 15 years, with more people accepting it than opposing it. The US has followed the path of other liberal democracies and has [legalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage#Same-sex_marriage_around_the_world) same-sex marriage. Therefore, whene there is a social and political majority big enough, laws can be changed.
1.6.9.1.3. Con: If that many people represent a majority of voters and they support candidates who want to implement those programs, chances are those programs are indeed implemented.
1.6.9.1.3.1. Con: It takes more than a simple majority of voters to implement a program that is deemed unconstitutional. For example, the U.S. can't implement a mandatory [foster care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care) program even if a majority of voters wanted it.
1.6.9.1.3.2. Pro: There have been majorities to approve [welfare programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States#Federal_welfare_programs) in the US, as they were recognized as necessary by a political and social majority. First, in 1935 with a federally sponsored retirement program and then as Social Security Act. Since then, aside from Medicaid, there are 13 large categories that include [welfare](http://federalsafetynet.com/us-welfare-programs.html) programs in the US.
1.6.9.2. Con: Democracy held up just fine for 160 years \([1776](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#Independence_and_expansion_\(1776%E2%80%931865\))-[1935](https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/public-welfare/origins-of-the-state-federal-public-welfare-programs/)\) in the U.S. without a national welfare system.
1.6.9.3. Pro: Arguably minority rights has been an important democratic development to prevent democracy from becoming the tyranny of the majority, and people needing welfare services could be considered minorities, the poor, sick, unemployed…

This is not a strong argument. The philosophical underpinning of the welfare state is its universality. Everyone, minority as well as majority, should have the right to an agreed minimum standard of living.
1.6.9.4. Pro: Destruction of the welfare state would cause the governmental model to devolve backwards towards feudalism or towards "Might makes right" as shown in failed states in Africa. The poor would be forced toward crime in order to survive \(as full legal employment is almost impossible\) and this in turn would create a massive black economy that could not be taxed or regulated.
1.6.9.5. Pro: For education to be available only to those who can afford it would be a waiste of human capital. If protection by the law is only available for those who can afford it this would lead to \(social\) injustice and anarchy for all others. Also the others would probably seek safety in numbers by forming gangs or mobs to protect themselves which would lead to violence and bloodshed.
1.6.9.6. Pro: The welfare state is a prerequisite for a democratic capitalist system. Without access to education and healthcare we can not assume that the average citizen will have the education or energy to participate in a system that is based on the electorate keeping themselves informed. A system that does not grant its citizen equal access to these two basic human rights can therefore not be considered democratic or moral. In such cases "democracy" becomes a moral cover for an entrenched plutocracy.
1.6.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.
1.6.9.7. Pro: As long as it is not replaced by another system of wealth redistribution, it should be kept. 
The state guarantees its own existence in the long-term by avoiding power the accumulation of power in a subset of its population.
1.6.9.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.3.14.
1.6.9.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.
1.6.9.10. Pro: -> See 1.6.5.3.
1.6.9.11. Con: Welfare is the antithesis of meritocracy, a system far more moral than democracy.
1.7. Pro: The welfare state attracts abusers
1.7.1. Con: Abuse of the welfare state, to whatever degree it exists, does not undermine the need for or value of welfare programs.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Even if the system is being abused by some, removing it completely will cause innocent children and elderly people to die. It is inhumane to let needy people starve in the streets.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Abuse isn't a sufficient cause for abolition: if something you value is being abused, you fix the rules/policing. Abuse is a pretext for abolishing something you don't like for other reasons.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: For example, roads are full of drivers engaging in all manner of antisocial behavior behind the wheel, but no one calls for the asphalt to be taken up. Same with private insurance of all kinds; we are sure that abuse is endemic, but no one calls for it to end.
1.7.2. Con: Every organized society attracts abusers.
1.7.3. Pro: The welfare state may draws in illegal aliens.
1.7.3.1. Con: Undocumented Immigrants do not qualify for and cannot receive welfare. In most cases, they are drawn to the United States to flee violence, or lack of opportunity in their home country, not for a welfare system they cannot benefit from. [In fact, all illegal immigrants who hold a job pay taxes, even though they are not eligible to receive welfare.](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/sep/28/tom-delay/tom-delay-says-most-illegal-immigrants-draw-welfar/)
1.7.4. Con: The attraction of non-abuse to an easily accessible system of affluence is greater and generally overcomes reliance on welfare.
1.7.5. Con: People should have an inherent right to a living wage and the basic necessities of life. If we are so callous as to the needs of others and support corporate greed over people, what kind of society are we? If we create a society that helps people become self sustaining through education, access to proper healthcare, making sure they have affordable housing etc. then we are actively preventing, as opposed to encouraging, inappropriate leeching off of the system.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Human beings move on contexts where we make decisions every moments of our lifes. Some call it "free will", but actually we decide based upon our present knowledge. And as we learn by time, we make decisions supported by that learning. If the state makes efficent calls in policy making, like described above, the population will be taught \(by example\) how to value institutions \(public/private\) that contribute to the welfare of its citizens.
1.7.6. Con: The welfare state is flawed, but despite this, a form of social safety net is necessary. Re-vamping the welfare system to ensure that people who deserve welfare get it, and those who do not deserve welfare don't get it would be ideal.
1.7.7. Con: There is evidence in e.g. UK that people's perceptions of abuse are massively distorted to the reality - where abuse is low.
1.7.7.1. Pro: While the British public thinks that around 27% of welfare Budget is lost to fraud, the levels are [way lower](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/may/13/welfare-fraud-error-universal-credit) and are out weighted by errors from citizens and officials alike.
1.7.7.2. Pro: Fraud actually represents the [2.1%](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/may/13/welfare-fraud-error-universal-credit) of the overall benefit expenditure. From that, only 0.7% id due to actual fraud, while the rest  is due to claimant errors \(0.9%\) and to officials errors \(0.5%\).
1.7.8. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.
1.8. Con: Nations with strong welfare states \(e.g. Scandinavia\) have less inequality and higher quality of life.
1.8.1. Pro: The welfare state inherently benefits everyone in the state. Even if a particular person never needs to use a particular welfare service \(such as food stamps, public education, free health clinics\), they benefit from living in a society where all of their fellow citizens have access to the things those services provide.
1.8.2. Con: While Sweden had the highest greatest improvement of social fluidity during the 50's and 60's, Sweden had the second largest deterioration during the 70's, when the welfare state was mostly founded by social democrat Olof Palme [eurofound.europa.eu](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_publication/field_ef_document/ef1664en.pdf)
1.8.3. Con: The timeline of Sweden's social experiment has not yet run its course.
1.8.3.1. Con: The reforms that led to the Swedish welfare state are over 150 years old, and continuously adapted to new developments and needs. It is not an "experiment" and not a static model.

1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.4.1.5.
1.9. Con: A society without equality of opportunity is not just, per John Rawls principle of [Justice as Fairness](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/#JusFaiJusWitLibSoc).
1.9.1. Pro: The primary duty of a state is the welfare of all its citizens. By their nature all states should be welfare states.
1.9.1.1. Con: The primary duty of a state may be to guarantee their citizens safety, however, what accounts for welfare or not is a much more subjective matter.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: For example, some countries consider healthcare, education or a military force to be part of their duty or mandate while other do not.
1.10. Pro: There should be no welfare state, so a more just system could emerge.
1.10.1. Con: There is no clear or obvious way welfare is preventing a more just system from emerging.
1.10.1.1. Con: [Food sharing bans](http://www.newsweek.com/illegal-feed-criminalizing-homeless-america-782861) are one clear and obvious way that government interference is preventing alternative welfare systems from emerging.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: The ban is not a case of welfare, but of local government not wanting homeless people in that neighbourhood.
1.10.1.2. Con: Money taken in the form of taxes to fund the welfare state could otherwise be going to the voluntary non-profit/philanthropic sector, which is both a more just and more effective system for promoting human welfare.
1.10.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.12.
1.10.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.10.2. Pro: A welfare state is an acknowledgement of a broken economic model rather than a solution in itself.
1.10.2.1. Con: In an economy with huge number of people, it's impossible to expect welfare to naturally arrive from the interactions. Thus, the greater the economic system is, the more care must be given to keep its citizens in minimal functional conditions, i.e., welfare.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.2.1.
1.10.4. Pro: The welfare state softens the [exploitation of the working class](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/ch08.htm) enough to forestall revolution, but will never achieve economic justice. It prolongs the system of capitalism, which should otherwise be allowed to fail.
1.10.4.1. Con: This assumes that the working class is being exploited by their employers. Economic Justice is nothing more than a freely offered price for a good or service being freely accepted or rejected buy the buyer.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: The labor market is in no way "free." Public policy features of modern capitalism like limited liability, the disparate treatment for passive and active income, and the contrast between relatively free flow of capital and the highly encumbered flow of labor across national borders, combine to generally stack the labor market in favor of buyers.
1.10.4.2. Con: Uncontrolled failure of any large scale economic system would likely result in a great deal of human suffering and should be avoided, if possible.
1.10.4.3. Con: Capitalism is a doctrine that requires a welfare state to support the most vulnerable in society because it involves the exploitation of the workforce to maximise profit. As long as capitalism exists, there is a requirement for welfare.
1.10.4.3.1. Pro: Without the welfare state the [exploitation of the working class](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/index.htm) by the owners of the means of production would be too obvious. For capitalism to keep existing, it is necessary that the working class doesn't get class consciousness.
1.10.5. Pro: The welfare state provides a patch to help those in need without forcing states to really tackle inequality and poverty.
1.10.5.1. Con: A patch is neccessary if there is currently no way to adequately tackle the problem. For example, if there is a leaky dike, you patch the leak before you start to build a stronger dike.
1.10.5.1.1. Pro: Communism, a recent attempted solution to this problem, has numerous unintended negative effects.
1.10.5.2. Pro: People, who want socialism, should be against the welfare state. The welfare state gives people just enough so that they will not challenge the capitalist economic system. We will reach socialism faster if the welfare state is abolished.
1.10.5.2.1. Con: That is not supported by historical evidence. Most examples of states without a welfare system either develop a tribal power structure and/or develop an underclass of people in debt bondage.
1.10.5.2.1.1. Con: The United States ended slavery in [1865](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States) but didn't introduce national welfare until [1935](https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/public-welfare/origins-of-the-state-federal-public-welfare-programs/).
1.10.5.2.2. Con: A welfare state is [defined](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/welfare%20state) as "a social system based on the assumption by a political state of primary responsibility for the individual and social welfare of its citizens". Socialism would fall under this philosophy.
1.10.5.2.3. Con: Welfare systems and other economic distribution systems can be seen as "stepping-stones" towards socialism.
1.10.5.2.4. Con: The distinction between capitalism and socialism is false.  Social cooperation and trade exist in all human societies.
1.10.6. Pro: The welfare state should be replaced by a Universal Basic Income \(UBI\).
1.10.6.1. Pro: If replaced by UBI \(universal basic income\) then welfare would be unnecessary as society would have created a contract for itself to ensure every citizen is entitled to a guaranteed minimum level of support regardless of situation.
1.10.6.1.1. Con: Society does not only consist of citizens. Such a replacement would create greater inequality between citizens and non-citizens.
1.10.6.1.2. Con: UBI does not guarantee an improvement on social welfare. For example, in a capitalist economy, markets will react to the new influx of capital by raising prices on good/services. Instead of throwing money in the market and hoping for the best, the welfare state directly subsidizes specific common needs \(healthcare, housing, food, etc\), making it far more efficient and less likely to be compromised by market influence.
1.10.6.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.3.
1.10.6.1.3. Con: UBI does not provide sufficiently for all.
1.10.6.1.4. Con: UBI is itself a form of welfare.
1.10.6.2. Con: A UBI requires a mandatory minimum contribution to the economy. It can be a civil service requirement, tax funding collection \(like social security\) or providing an economically beneficial service within the country.
1.10.6.3. Con: UBI and welfare do provide some overlapping functions but also have some key differences. So if you required a greater level of welfare than that which UBI provided, you would need welfare alongside UBI. It is true that UBI may negate the need for much welfare but not all.
