Discussion Title: Should Hate Speech Be Legally Protected?

1. Hate speech should be legally protected
1.1. Con: Hate speech is wrong, from an ethical point of view, and should therefore be made illegal.
1.1.1. Con: In some cases, something labeled 'hate speech' can be morally right. Some things need to be said, and staying silent could be far more dangerous and even immoral than speaking out.
1.1.1.1. Con: Hate speech is directed at a person or group of people, not at an action or activity. For example saying "anal sex holds a higher risk of transmitting STI's" is correct and not hate speech, saying "Homosexuality is wrong because anal sex holds a higher risk of transmitting STI's" is hate speech.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Opinion tangentially connected to fact is not in itself fact; and facts are rarely labeled hate speech unless they are presented in a context to engender hate.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Many times in many platforms across scientific fields [facts are labeled as hate speech](https://www.mindingthecampus.org/2013/07/05/how_hate_facts_kill_scientific/).
1.1.2. Con: Government control over speech is wrong, as is outlawing dissent, and by the same logic, controlling speech is wrong and should therefore be illegal \(which is why it is\).
1.1.2.1. Con: Dissent is already often met with legal repercussions for the dissenters. Protesters frequently face jail time or arrest records for acts of civil disobedience in protest.
1.1.3. Con: Government cannot and should not make every morally wrong act illegal.
1.1.3.1. Pro: To legislate and enforce the illegality of every immoral act would require a totalitarian police state.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Legal, state-based sanctions crowd out private, community-based sanctions. We need more of the latter, and fewer of the former.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Community based sanctions \(such as [ostracization](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ostracization)\) have been shown to be less effective, and more detrimental to the offender as they do not have methods of appeal, or time constraints.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: The judicial system is already unable to prosecute every illegal act, that does not mean we should abandon laws or working towards a better system.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Government is a blunt hammer. It is not a subtle enough instrument to make delicate moral or ethical judgments, or to take effective corrective action. Social approbation, on the other hand, is a scalpel, and a delicate enough instrument to do these things. People like to be liked; leave the tools of guilt, shame, confrontation, and conversation, to address the problem, rather than the prison-yard, the fine, the parole officer, and the chain gang.
1.1.3.3. Con: Every morally wrong act that has the ability to to hurt others should be illegal in order protect other citizens.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Hate speech does not hurt anyone. It can only hurt people's feelings, which need not be protected.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: [Psychological harm](https://www.kialo.com/should-hate-speech-be-legally-protected-10134/10134.0=10134.1-10134.3-10134.300-10134.688/-10134.688)
1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Speech cannot harm anyone directly, only the concrete consequences it provokes can.
1.1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Hate speech consequences are actions perpetrated by those who felt sympathethic with the speech in the first place. Thus, limiting sympathy by exposing hate speech - not censoring it - has the priority.
1.1.3.3.1.1.2. Con: It is only harm as long as it is allowed. Interpretation is entirely subject to the "victim" and is never uniform.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: But it can cause social disorder, and divide society.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Laws are there to protect society, not to reflect individual morality.
1.1.3.5. Con: Laws should reflect the will of society. If society believes an act is immoral, the government should legislate to prevent people engaging in such an act.
1.1.3.5.1. Con: Laws exist to protect the rights of all citizens, even the unpopular ones. A lot of people believe that pre-marital sex and cross dressing are immoral. That does not mean that we should start throwing people in prison who do those things.
1.1.3.6. Con: As the government is the only entity that can pass laws into legislation it can make every immoral act illegal. Whether an immoral act should be made illegal is supposed to be determined by society through the process of election, civil input, and academic discourse.
1.1.4. Con: There is no one objective ethical view, so no action - hate speech included, can be objectively ethically wrong.
1.1.4.1. Con: [Argumentation ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_ethics) proposed by Hans-Hermann Hoppe is, as claimed by its proposer, a proof that there is only one objective ethical point of view.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Which is "a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and for libertarianism in particular" as Murray Rothbard said.
1.1.5. Pro: Hate speech should be discouraged around the world because of the emotional harm it does in the society amidst groups and humanity.
1.1.5.1. Con: Emotional harm is entirely dependent on interpretation, therefore allows abuse.
1.1.5.2. Con: Emotional harm caused by speech must be heard and allowed influence. While there are free speech laws, there is no rule to force anyone to pay attention to hate speech. Change in this causality chain should be in the choice to ignore, not prevent a right.
1.1.5.3. Con: Discouragement should not be done through law-enforcement.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Social processes should indeed be guided by society not by lawmakers. Free speech is paramount from that perspective.
There needs to be active discussion in the society and people should engage with each other \(as we are here\); hateful and even outright stupid thoughts need to be out in the open, so they could be criticized.
1.1.5.3.2. Con: Lawmaking needs to get involved, if voices of minorities get muffled or shouted down. Groups or individuals can't be forcibly left voiceless - this can \(and has\) lead to dehumanization and from there on out, violence is the next logical step.
1.1.5.3.2.1. Con: In practice it is the loud minorities that shout down the passive majority.
1.1.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: Black Lives matter, protesting against the existence of- and raising awareness of the [lowest relative murder](http://prntscr.com/kwn11k) rate if broken into racial group on racial group. Actuality: It being lowest, makes it least priority if one is to separate them in this fashion.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2. Pro: Feminists claiming [rights inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment) still exist, based on perceived male-controlled society, when in actuality it is simply a matter of statistical distribution and unreasonably \(or as intellectual dishonesty\) interpreting statistical performance.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Women claiming there is a [Gender pay gap](https://i.imgur.com/YhfDNdX.png), while in actuality they are simply[falsely interpreting](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-gender-pay-gap-is-a-complete-myth/) a number of a statistic, without paying attention to what is behind it \(a combination of factors like regular work hours, work-family relative focus, productivity, biological reasons= varying effects across different professions\)
1.1.5.3.2.1.3. Pro: Vocal minorities pressure companies into enacting [gender quotas](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42614795) and general diversity requirements that force employee selection [away from performance and niche skills](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paologaudiano/2018/04/02/stop-focusing-on-diversity/#190657ee6764). Said pressure is most often applied through [Heckler's veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler%27s_veto), as there is otherwise no other causality, nor legal requirement.
1.1.6. Pro: Making people feel unsafe or inferior is morally wrong.
1.1.6.1. Con: People can always feel unsafe or inferior even if that was not the intention of the one who said whatever it is that made them feel like that. And there is also no real measurable system for how unsafe you feel. That is why the law, until recently, was always concentrated on actual tangible facts, not feelings.
1.1.6.2. Con: It is not the fact that someone 'said something' that makes a person feel unsafe or inferior, it is only if they appear to be of great power/responsibility/popularity in the community that such emotions are elicited. Thus the problem is not the speech itself, but the authority of that speech that is offensive.
1.1.6.3. Pro: This is particularly true when such insults are based on an immutable characteristic.
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Hate speech often takes the forms of racism, sexism or homophobia. Such insults are based respectively on the immutable characteristics of race, sex and sexuality.
1.1.6.4. Con: Putting criminals in prison makes them feel unsafe and inferior. This is not widely viewed as morally wrong.
1.1.6.4.1. Con: What is considered morally wrong for normal citizens is not always the same for the imprisoned, who have committed immoral acts themselves.
1.1.7. Pro: Hate speech communicates Hate Bias, which is a clearly defined crime. Social Policy determines that crime is never protected.[law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/249)
1.2. Pro: We ought to obey the U.S. Constitution's admonition against prohibiting free speech in the First Amendment.
1.2.1. Pro: The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that hate speech is legally protected speech.
1.2.1.1. Pro: For example, in Snyder v. Phelps, the Court ruled that the Westboro Baptist Church had the right to picket a funeral—a deeply offensive act. [Six Supreme Court hate speech cases.](https://www.thoughtco.com/hate-speech-cases-721215)
1.2.1.2. Con: The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly ruled that  threatening to undermine state institutions by terror organizations is no free speech \([Gündüz vs Turkey](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"itemid":\["001-61522"\]})\).
1.2.1.3. Pro: The European Court of Human Rights ruled that incitement of ethnic hatred \([Balsytė-Lideikienė v. Lithuania](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"itemid":\["002-1844"\]})\) is not a violation of the freedom of speech and therefore admissiable.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Especially online hate speech laws have been ruled to be more permissable.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: The four most recent cases of the European Court of Human Rights on this subject have all been deemed inadmissible or judged as no violation. \([Delfi AS v. Estonia](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"itemid":\["003-5110487-6300958"\]}), [MTE v Hungary](http://Magyar Tartalomszolgaltatok Egyesulete and Index.hu Zrt v. Hungary), [Pihl v. Sweden](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press#{"itemid":\["003-5650866-7156310"\]}) & [Smajic v. Bosnia](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press#{"itemid":\["003-5999255-7685303"\]})\)
1.2.1.5. Pro: There is no need to privilege the protection of any kind of speech when, in the United States, there is no state action to censor such speech. Private entities can and should do with any speech what they will.
1.2.1.5.1. Con: This is only relevant to the USA, it does not apply to other countries which may have different laws.
1.2.2. Con: It's not the government's job to protect speech. It's the government's job not to infringe on speech.
1.2.2.1. Con: The government's job in this regard is not to manage just speech, but to ensure productive ideas and opinions and promote diverse thought and debate, while limiting harmful such, if harm would be sufficient. The exact need for limits is subjective and so varies across countries.
1.2.3. Con: Free speech limits human rights.
1.2.3.1. Pro: If all forms of free speech are accepted, we are legitimazing fascism, terrorism or xenophobic speech, which come from deep belief, not from reason, and thus cannot be beaten through discussion. So the forms of hate speech that attempt against human rights should be forbidden.
1.2.4. Con: Just because Americans have that constitutional right, it does not mean it should not be limited in certain cases.
1.2.4.1. Con: If the constitution is not considered legally binding, then it has no force.  It has been a force of good for over 200 years.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Adding limitations, restrictions or amendments to the constitution doesn't invalidate its legal authority or power. If that was the case, the very amendment granting 'free speech' would have already invalidated it.
1.2.4.2. Pro: There are already limitations of the right to free speech such as intentionally inciting panic/terror, libel and fraud.
1.2.5. Con: Living in a society in which it is known one will eventually have to pay a small fine for calling someone a derogatory slur doesn't necessarily make you less free, it just makes the legal consequences of your speech more predictable.
1.2.6. Con: The constitution by it's nature is not necessarily the basis for a strong society, therefore as with all laws, they can be revisited based on what is best for society and the individuals within it.
1.2.7. Pro: The [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) \(U.S. Constitution\) and [Article Nineteen](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf) \(United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights\) do not place conditions upon or permit any curtailment of speech; protection of speech should be applied as broadly as possible.
1.2.8. Con: That it is law is not really an argument for the question whether it should be law.
1.2.9. Con: Current limitations on speech are too weak. For example, under the [imminent lawless action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imminent_lawless_action) test, speech is not protected by the First Amendment only if the speaker intends to incite a violation of the law that is both imminent and likely.
1.2.10. Con: The US Constitution has no jurisdiction over hate speech in other countries.
1.2.10.1. Con: Other countries would do well to follow the US lead in this area and enact similar measures.
1.2.11. Con: Once speech becomes a tool that causes psychological harm to individuals it is no longer one of language but of abuse. See [Harvard University's research on verbal child abuse](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/04/verbal-beatings-hurt-as-much-as-sexual-abuse/) which insists that \[speech\] is a form of abuse with lasting effects.
1.2.11.1. Pro: Americans do have a right to freedom of speech, but when that speech causes intended visible harm to human beings; those individuals should be prosecuted. This does not mean people should not be able to say whatever they want, but simply that if they say something that hurts other humans beings, they must take responsibility for that.
1.2.11.1.1. Con: A risk of prosecution is a large gamble to take when it is not clear what speech is punishable, and what speech is not.
1.2.11.1.1.1. Con: If a person thinks that they are taking a risk in saying something, that means they understand that what they are saying could be potentially harmful. We risk getting in car accidents by being around vehicles. speech is different in that it is much more subjective than traffic laws, but people still get into accidents, and make mistakes when they speak. The laws surrounding hate speech are not as extensive as traffic laws, and perhaps they should be, in a complex, hierarchical structure.
1.2.11.2. Con: Since there is no widely-accepted definition of "hate speech," this gives far too much leeway for the law to be selectively enforced according to people and speech that authorities just happen to dislike.
1.2.11.2.1. Pro: "Hate speech" is subjective, since some people will take offense to something when others will not.  "To think is to risk offending".  The only exception to this would be a direct incitement to be violent.
1.2.11.2.1.1. Con: One could argue that hate speech increases the probability of violence.
1.2.11.2.1.2. Pro: The difficulty with legislating any form of speech lies in drawing the line between what is acceptable and what isn't. However, the value in avoiding the significant mental and societal harm caused by hate speech outweighs any negative consequences associated with drawing a difficult line.
1.2.11.2.1.3. Pro: The very definition of [what constitutes hate speech is subjective.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/04/a-new-argument-for-hate-speech-laws-um-no/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.97701f5b747c)  Consequentially, legislative restrictions on what constitutes "hate speech" will be decided by the majority at the expense of what the minority believes to be their free speech rights.
1.2.11.2.1.4. Pro: Perception of "hate" in other people"s speech lies with the observer, not necessarily with the speaker. This gives way to subjectivism, and ever increasing censorship.
1.2.11.2.1.5. Pro: The term 'hate speech' itself is nothing more than a disingenuous rhetorical device used to stifle the free exchange of ideas. The evidence lies in the adjective itself, which must be defended against before any controversy on the original subject can even be addressed.
1.2.11.2.1.6. Con: A version of the [Miller Test](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/obscenity) could be used to determine whether or not speech constitutes hate speech.
1.2.11.2.1.6.1. Con: The Miller Test which is used to determine 'obscenity' is again quite subjective, as the linked article does state that the Supreme Court has repeatedly struggled with what it defines as "problematic elements".  This is also confounded by the fact that different states have their own individual laws regarding this.
1.2.11.2.1.7. Con: There are some rules that define hate speech. For example it is legitimate to use stronger words against politicians than regular citizens as ruled by the ECHR in the [Oberschlick case](http://lehofer.at/blog/Oberschlick_2.pdf).
1.2.11.2.1.7.1. Con: Which is yet another example of discriminatory rules. It is impossible to justify a difference in accepted behavior towards a politician and a convicted criminal for example \(which is a regular citizen\).
1.2.11.2.2. Con: Cases of hate speech are not defined until proven that they have caused harm to individual\(s\). This is how [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) works, and should be applied to hate speech. Laws should not be made preventing people from saying specific things, but judges and juries should decide if that action was abusive or not, and act accordingly, after the "crime" was committed. We are all innocent until proven guilty.
1.2.11.2.3. Pro: Hate is an emotion.  If you prohibit some speech, based on the emotion and or thoughts of the one who spoke it, then you are suggesting that some thoughts or emotions should be illegal as well.  This is a slippery slope best avoided by simply protecting all speech.
1.2.11.2.4. Pro: Any speech may be deemed hateful by someone who disagrees with it.
1.2.11.2.4.1. Con: Opinion does not equate to legislation. The process for developing and signing into law restrictions is much more complex and requires more support than a single "anyone's" opinion.
1.2.11.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.11.2.1.6.
1.2.11.2.6. Pro: This ['selective censorship](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms)' is already in affect on Facebook. Its algorithms protect the speech of white men while censoring those of Black people.
1.2.11.2.6.1. Con: There is no racial bias as implied by the somewhat incendiary headline. 'White men' are a protected category, as are 'Black men', because race and gender are protected. 'Black children' are not protected, because age is not a protected category, but nor are 'White children'. 'Black people' would also constitute a protected category. 'White male republicans' would not.
1.2.11.2.6.2. Con: It is not "inconsistent", as the source says, for Facebook to censor a post condemning all white people as racists, but not to censor a post specifically targeting radicalised Muslims who are murdering people. That is nothing to do with protecting the speech of white men or censoring black people.
1.2.11.2.7. Con: A minimal set of hate speech could easily be defined which is universally acceptable.  Even if it is as narrow as "any speech which tells others to kill all members of a set race".
The line where hate speech ends may be impossible to define, but some speech can still safely be defined hate speech.
1.2.11.2.7.1. Con: Codified limitation on allowed/not allowed speech means constant update based on location, time, initiator, target, and indicate levels of hatred regarding all these criteria which in practice is impossible to manage.
1.2.11.2.8. Con: The [common definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hate_speech) of hate speech is speech that is abusive or threatening, or writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group based on race, gender, or sexual orientation.
1.2.11.2.8.1. Con: That is from the [Top english dictionary](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-English-dictionary).  The other highly rated dictionaries vary slightly in actions listed:["expresses hate or encourages violence..."](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hate-speech) , ["disparaging..."](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hate-speech), and ["attacks, threatens, or insults..."](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hate-speech?s=t).
1.2.11.2.8.2. Con: Most dictionaries, including the [definition talked about here](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hate_speech), list the groups \[race, religion, gender\] [as examples](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hate-speech), and do not presume to define a standard list of groups, or even wether [individuals](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hate-speech) can be considered a target.
1.2.11.2.8.3. Con: The terms "abusive" and "threatening" are by no means objective or even consistently defined. [Oxford Dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com)
1.2.11.2.8.3.1. Pro: For example, "threatening" may mean simply having a "hostile quality" or, in law, "showing an intention to cause bodily harm." "Abusive" may be "extremely offensive and insulting" or "engaging in or characterized by habitual violence and cruelty." Thus "hate speech" could be considered either constituting psychic harm or physical harm, which must be distinguished from one another.
1.2.11.2.9. Pro: "Hate speech" should be protected because the definition of "hate" is broad, not objective, and often, practically, includes factual statements to which some may take offense \(see ["American Renaissance Banned from Twitter"](https://www.amren.com/news/2017/12/press-release-jared-taylor-american-renaissance-banned-twitter/)\). Because of their non-objective nature, offenses may be used by those in power to restrict criticism.
1.2.11.2.9.1. Con: We can only protect legally that which is defined clearly. Hate speech is difficult, at best, to define. Both in where it ends and where it begins.
1.2.11.2.9.1.1. Con: This is not how constitutional laws work. Freedom of speech is a negative right.[Negative and positive rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights)
1.2.11.2.10. Pro: Hate speech laws are really about giving certain groups licence to degrade certain other groups. The laws are discriminatory and should not exist.
1.2.11.2.11. Pro: Unpopular speech is the speech most in need of free speech protections since no one objects to popular speech.
1.2.12. Pro: Part of free speech is the right to offend.
1.2.12.1. Pro: Our rights are sacred. Our feelings are not. Once you have given away your rights, the government will not voluntarily give them back.
1.2.12.1.1. Pro: The Patriot Act still exists, even though the Government told Americans that it was a temporary measure to fight terrorists in 2001.
1.2.12.1.2. Pro: When the political climate changes out of your favor in the future, your opponents will have the ability to silence your speech as well.
1.2.12.1.2.1. Con: This assumes that the restrictions on hate speech are exceedingly general and fluid. A properly defined set of regulations may still be mutable in future settings, but not merely by political whim.
1.2.12.1.3. Con: The right to incite psychological harm and fear in innocent people is not a right anyone should have.
1.2.12.1.3.1. Con: If the creating fear in innocent people is not a right anyone should have, why should the government create such fear by repressing any speech? Such repression would lead to the very fear it intends to prevent.
1.2.12.1.3.1.1. Con: In this case the speaker isn't 'innocent.' Furthermore the government in most 'free societies' does not enforce law through inciting terror or fear, but through a judicial process with appeals and checks.
1.2.12.1.4. Con: Most rights held by people today were rarely 'given' to them, more often those rights had to be fought for and earned. If the 'right to hate' is take or given away, it is not necessarily one that should be given back.
1.2.12.1.4.1. Con: People have as much the right to their emotions as their bodies. The government should not be trying to regulate any emotion, even hate.
1.2.12.1.4.1.1. Con: Regulating hate speech isn't regulating emotion, but action. It is not illegal to be so mad with someone that you want them dead. It is illegal to take the actions that lead to their death.
1.2.12.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: This is the reason that minors are generally tried under a different set of laws and are not legally responsible for themselves. ie why a child's parents make medical decisions for their children.
1.2.12.2. Pro: "Hate Speech" is a made up pejorative, used by post-modernists in order to silence those will different opinions and beliefs. Short of inciting panic and direct calls for violence, all speech must be free, or we are not free people. [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbsZAyKFh2g)
1.2.12.2.1. Con: It is true that the notion of ''hateful speech'' can and is sometimes used abusively to disparage an opinion one disagrees with.  The temptation to recourse to such a sophism toward non hateful speech  is not a sufficient ground to allow the expression of hateful speech.
1.2.12.3. Pro: If free speech is intended for anyone, it is for the most unsavory and unpopular opinions in existence. It is not necessary to protect already accepted ideas and modes of communication.
1.2.12.3.1. Con: Hate speech is not simply unsavory or unpalatable, it is an attempt to remove human rights from certain groups of people due to characteristics that are beyond their control, such as race, gender, sexuality, or nation of origin. If we hold as self-evident the belief that all humans are created equal, then speech that seeks to define other humans as non-equals should be regulated.
1.2.12.4. Con: One can offend without using hate speech. saying "You're hair is ugly, and your style is tacky" is offensive without being hate speech.
1.2.12.4.1. Con: Far too often any comment about looks and style \(as given in the parent\) are seen as attacks on the racial characteristics or culture of the attacked. This could classify this speach as hate speech.
1.2.12.4.1.1. Pro: Often such comments are a result of racial biases or result in racial biases, this is not intrinsically the case.
1.2.12.5. Con: Offensive and hateful are not synonymous.
1.2.12.6. Con: Hate speech encourages hateful and harmful action, which is an impediment to the freedom of others.
1.2.12.6.1. Pro: Hate-Speech used as a political instrument might shape the public view on a minority and make them more vulnerable to attacks.
1.2.12.6.1.1. Con: The general public's views on various demographics should be accountable to the general public.
1.2.12.6.1.2. Pro: Hate speech is a politically motivated construct that targets non-protected groups while favoring protected groups.
1.2.12.6.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.2.12.6.1.2.2. Con: Protecting certain groups more than others can be justified in order to enable the freedom of the protected group.
1.2.12.6.1.2.2.1. Con: Protecting certain groups more than others is a sure means to make the 'certain' groups have the sense that others in the society believe them unable to stand on their own feet, and in some instances to believe it themselves.
1.2.12.6.1.2.2.2. Con: Even if certain groups should be afforded rights not enjoyed by others, it's not clear how we'd identify those groups, or judge how much protection they need, or how we'd evaluate whether the banning of 'hate speech' was helping those groups more than harming them.
1.2.12.6.1.2.3. Pro: No rigorous, objective test of hate speech exists. It is a charge selectively levelled only at politically weak out-groups.
1.2.12.6.1.2.3.1. Con: Considering context, the term "straight white male" and similar versions fall under hate speech too. Straight white males are not a politically weak out-group, but a non-reactionary one for the most part.
1.2.12.6.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: That term attempts to [diminish someone's opinion and status](https://twitter.com/joshdenny/status/997604506522140672?lang=en).
1.2.12.6.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: It is [censored in BF5](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/9e2n9t/battlefield_v_censors_white_man_in_the_chat/), which is notorious for its SJW theme.
1.2.12.6.1.3. Con: If hate speech is being used as a political tool by government, then legislating against it, will only give that government more authority to continue their propaganda, as they will have the power to say anything that disagrees with their propaganda is hate speech.
1.2.12.6.1.4. Pro: Hate speech is powerful and can lead to emulation, especially in societies which are experiencing economic difficulties.
1.2.12.6.1.5. Pro: Hate speech can be used by populist politicians to whip up the support by finding an "enemy" in a minority group.
1.2.12.6.2. Pro: Hate speech inculcates beliefs into vulnerable people and makes them more susceptible to being influenced to performing acts of discrimination, violence, and eventually killing those in the target field.
1.2.12.6.2.1. Con: All speech tries to communicate ideas to others. It does not follow that ideas communicated must be inculcated into beliefs by the recipient.
1.2.12.6.2.2. Con: Hate speech and incitement to commit a crime are separate ideas. Many things, for example, alcohol, create situations where vulnerable people are more susceptible to being incited to commit a crime also.
1.2.12.6.2.3. Pro: Those who are in the targeted field of the hate speech are at risk of this violence in all aspects of their lives, at work, at play, at their houses of worship, and even in their own homes.
1.2.12.6.2.4. Pro: Hate speech indoctrinates the vulnerable into adopting extremist views. It leads to wide spread radicalisation which is detrimental to society.
1.2.12.6.3. Pro: Hate speech is equivalent to an act of violence because of the pain it willingly inflicts on others. Hence it must be controlled.
1.2.12.6.3.1. Con: While violence may be an impediment to other's freedom, hate speech in itself is not.
1.2.12.6.3.1.1. Con: Hate speech is usually the breeding ground for violence against certain groups.
1.2.12.6.3.1.2. Pro: People have legal responsibility for themselves. 
The consequences of your actions are your own.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3. Con: Hate speech is likely to intimidate the people it is directed at, discouraging these individuals' participation in public debates and freedom of expression.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.1. Con: Freedom of speech is not the freedom to engage in hate speech which leads to hate crime, freedom to express hate is not in the constitution.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Hate speech does not violate anyone's rights, nor does it guarantee violence. The resulting crime, provoked or not, is responsibility of the acting party and nobody else.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.2. Con: The Civil Rights Movement was not discouraged by hate speech.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.2.1. Con: One historical example alone is not a good by itself, and while it was not dissuaded, many paid the ultimate price. Had hate speech been banned, the outcome might have been different.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.2.2. Con: They were not dissuaded, but to argue that the actors in the civil rights movements weren't fearful of or discouraged by the hate speech and the hateful repercussions they faced is wrong.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.3. Con: This is a matter for society not the legislature. Freedoms are encouraged when less control is ceded to the state.
1.2.12.6.3.1.4. Con: Inflicting intentional psychological trauma is a form of violence. Causing someone to regularly fear for their safety quickly degrades their quality of life. These are the same reasons stalking and death threats are not ignored in the name of freedom or free speech.
1.2.12.6.4. Con: Encouraging harmful behaviour is already illegal and is only a subset of what most people define as hate speech.
1.2.12.6.4.1. Con: Using a platform to promote damaging stereotypes can ultimately result in the dehumanisation of the groups they portray, legitimising their mistreatment or violence against them. This is not illegal in the U.S.
1.2.12.6.4.2. Con: Specificity is required in legislation; take for instance the issues surrounding ['up-skirting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upskirt)' which is a violation of people's privacy but occurs in public spaces and has therefor had rulings go both was as to it's legality.
1.2.12.6.4.3. Con: It is not true that inciting violence is only part of what people consider hate speech. In Canada where hate speech is outlawed, for example, [it is defined in section 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-73.html#h-93) as advocating genocide, or encouraging hatred towards a group which is likely to lead to a breach of the peace.
1.2.12.6.4.4. Pro: International Law already prohibits incitement. This includes advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx) \(ICCPR\) - signed by [172](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights) countries.
1.2.12.6.4.4.1. Con: Nation states observe the principle of 'Par in parem non habet imperium', \(Between equals there is no sovereign power\) John Austin therefore asserted that 'so-called' international law, lacking a sovereign power and so unenforceable, was not really law at all, but 'positive morality', consisting of 'opinions and sentiments...more ethical than legal in nature.[papers.ssrn.com](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2213675) This study has shown that 1 in 7 countries are willing to violate international law.
1.2.12.6.4.4.1.1. Con: The [172 countries all 'ratified' the treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights), which means it has been written into their own national law.
1.2.12.6.4.4.2. Con: Such a law is incompatible with the premise of the debate - that 'hate speech' be legally protected - so it should not be used as an argument in favour of hate speech being legally protected as it would be overturned.
1.2.12.6.4.4.2.1. Con: Promoting attacks is not "hate speech", it is incitement to violence. That is dealt with separately and does not depend on having "hate speech" legislation.
1.2.12.6.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: Hate speech can be reasonably interpreted as verbally attacking someone on the basis of ethnicity, religion, gender Identity etc... and so laws on incitement \( encouraging someone to become violent\) and hate speech can \(and do\) both coexist.
1.2.12.6.5. Con: -> See 1.2.12.6.3.1.
1.2.12.6.6. Con: Many instances of supposed "hate speech" pose no discernible physical threat. \(See numerous examples [here](https://www.thefire.org/category/cases/free-speech/).\)
1.2.12.6.6.1. Con: And yet many of them do. It is difficult to argue, for instance, that the [31% of hate crimes in the united states driven by a bias motivation against black people](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/02/us/who-commits-hate-crimes/index.html)are completely unmotivated by their shocking portrayal in The West for hundreds of years.
1.2.12.6.6.2. Con: Psychological harm is just as valid as physical harm, such as PTSD.
1.2.12.6.6.2.1. Con: The idea that psychological harm is just as valid as physical harm, if legally confirmed, would allow for lethal repercussions to perceived insults as self-defense.
1.2.12.6.6.2.1.1. Con: No, Self defense has a principle of justifiable harm. You can't murder someone because they are going to punch you, you can however strike them to protect yourself. Self defense when it comes to insults would equate to being allowed to insult your insult-er back - which is generally the social paradigm as it stands now.
1.2.12.6.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Murder is not self-defense.
1.2.12.6.6.2.1.1.2. Con: Lethal force is authorized in self-defense situations. That is why they are called self-defense situations, because life and liberty are being attacked.
1.2.12.6.6.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Only when there is a reasonable inference of intent to kill. One can not kill someone just because they are about to slap them; that would be murder.
1.2.12.6.6.2.1.2. Con: There are several psychological conditions which can result from non-physical trauma which can result in the sufferer physically harming themselves. Such as, but not limited to cases of self-harm and attempts at suicide as the result of bullying amongst teens and young adults.
1.2.12.6.7. Pro: Hate speech that calls for violence, or evokes symbolism or imagery of groups that have a history of perpetuating violence should be curtailed.
1.2.12.6.7.1. Con: Laws are already in place in most states of America \(and most countries around the world\) to deal with threats of violence. It is called [ethnic intimidation](https://definitions.uslegal.com/e/ethnic-intimidation/) , [forceful intimidation](https://definitions.uslegal.com/f/forceful-intimidation-because-of-race/) or something similar depending on the specific threat of violence \(religious, ethnic or otherwise\).
1.2.12.6.8. Con: Speech does not have to be hateful to encourage violent action.
1.2.12.6.9. Con: "Hate speech" results in no physical harms; one may argue there are psychic harms, though this is dependent on individual predispositions and interpretations, which cannot be codified into law.
1.2.12.6.9.1. Con: Psychic harms get codified into law all the time. For example, it is illegal to walk around a city naked. There is no other possible explanation for banning walking around naked than the psychic harm it causes on others. Therefore, it is obviously possible to codify psychic harms into law.
1.2.12.6.9.1.1. Con: There is a much larger grey area with hate speech than public nudity. Public nudity is discrete; either you are naked, or you are not. If you are naked we have agreed that this is unacceptable due to psychic harm to others.

Hate speech is more complicated as it is hard to determine when freedom of expression crosses a line into hate speech.
1.2.12.6.9.1.1.1. Con: Nudity is not quite that discrete. Clothing that is too skimpy or too revealing is commonly equated with nudity. The line between nudity and non-nudity is a matter of cultural norms, which vary over time and are always subject to contestation.
1.2.12.6.9.2. Con: Hate speech results in physical harm if it persuades people to take violent action.
1.2.12.6.9.2.1. Con: Hate speech is not a significant causality to violent action. The latter requires significant, but not sufficient intent in order for hate speech to be the deterministic influence.
1.2.12.6.9.2.1.1. Pro: In a similar sense, mood can be deterministic for whether to commit a crime or not. Mood is not regulated by law, however. Despite being able to have different effects, depending on context and situation, the same can be said for hate speech.
1.2.12.6.10. Pro: Hate speech creates an "othering" mentality which normalizes hateful behavior towards its targets by dehumanizing them. It is detrimental to the goal of a peaceful and collaborative society between humans.
1.2.12.6.10.1. Con: It could be argued that an "othering" mentality already exists, and that hate speech is an expression of this mentality.
1.2.12.6.11. Con: Labeling something someone says as 'hate speech' is essentially an attack on their character, not an argument as to why what they said is objectionable.
1.2.12.6.12. Con: Listening to provocative and disturbing speech allows one to reflect on and consider ideas they find objectionable. Such open-mindedness improves learning.
1.2.12.6.12.1. Pro: Being able to hear different perspective can provide valuable lessons about where society still needs to grow as a whole.
1.2.12.6.13. Pro: It leads to further harmful consequences that might even involve crimes.
1.2.12.6.13.1. Con: Crimes, by their definition, are already illegal.
1.2.12.6.13.2. Con: Speech that is hateful and speech that incites violence are inherently different and should be treated as such in legislation.   If not, we allow those inciting violence, under speech that isn't considered hateful under whatever legal framework were to exist, to act violently in the same manner as this argument portrays.
1.2.12.6.13.3. Con: There are a lot of things that lead to harmful consequences that might even involve crimes. As a justification to ban speech, this is overtly dangerous.
1.2.12.6.13.4. Pro: Hate speech can cause in the recipient of the message direct, adverse physical and emotional changes. The repeated use of such expressions cause and reinforce the subordination of these minorities.
1.2.12.6.14. Con: This is not a guaranteed action. This dismisses the idea that others can think for themselves. Hate speech does not guarantee hateful action, and saying otherwise disrespects the base value.
1.2.12.6.15. Pro: Hate speech often gets easily, quickly wide spread by tabloids and general media, and thus learnt and replicated. [Neo-nazi rally in the news](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/hundreds-of-neo-nazis-march-in-berlin-on-anniversary-of-hess-death-1.6388393)
1.2.12.6.15.1. Pro: Sometimes even unwillingly creating heroes, icons and role-models for those hate groups. [Praise to a Neo-nazi murderer](http://leejohnbarnes.blogspot.com/2009/09/freedom-for-josue-estebanez-de-la-hija.html)
1.2.12.6.15.2. Pro: We learn by imitation. That's why suicide usually doesn't get any media coverage. [social learning by imitation](http://web.colby.edu/socialpsychology/2015/03/21/social-learning-learning-through-imitation/)
1.2.12.6.16. Con: Any speech which encourages harmful action is already illegal and therefore, no new law should be created to designate "hate speech" as something different.
1.2.13. Pro: To announce something as hate speech, one is the judge, jury and executioner of what is acceptable and legitimate.  Anything but absolute free speech is someone else in control of speech.
1.2.14. Pro: The Constitutions 'Bill of Rights'; were written with the belief that these rights were 'Self-evident' and, as such, these rights are 'inalienable'. It was never the Constitution granting these rights; it was only recognizing these 'Truths' exist. If an individual is seeking to remove one of these Rights it is the governments duty to protect these Rights.
1.2.15. Pro: Hate speech being protected serves as a reminder of how it applies to everyone, not just people you agree with.
1.2.16. Con: Just because something is currently codified into law, such as the amendments to the U.S. Constitution, does not make them moral sound 'ad infinitum.' The ability to question and change laws that are dysfunctional or insufficient leads to a stronger legal system and society.
1.2.16.1. Con: The claim that society would be stronger is false. Ultimately a law that infringes individual rights will become a battle for control of those rights. This ultimately divides a society and makes it weaker.
1.3. Pro: Only unpopular/disagreeable speech needs legal protection, as it's disagreeable unpopularity threatens it by default.
1.3.1. Con: Hate speech is not unpopular or offensive. It usually contains a verbal threat, and as such it should not be permitted. In addition, hate speech is usually used by those with power against those who are weak
1.3.2. Con: If certain speech acts seek to discourage the equal distribution of liberty among all people \(such as revoking it from a minority group\), it would be absurd to argue that this is somehow in service of liberty.
1.4. Pro: There's no dichotomy between harmless speech and harmful speech, because all speech has consequences.
1.5. Con: Consequentialist arguments support the regulation of hate speech.
1.6. Con: Hate speech is too subjective to be defined, and thus protected.
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.2.9.1.
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.2.11.2.1.7.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.2.11.2.7.
1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.2.11.2.8.
1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.2.1.3.
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.2.
1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.2.11.2.9.
1.6.8. Con: Any society that holds a blanket protection of speech implicitly holds a protection of hate speech. A definition of hate speech isn't needed to protect hate speech. A definition is actually needed to specifically *not* protect it
1.6.9. Con: This is not logical: if hate speech is too subjective to be protected then it will be too subjective to be interdicted.
1.6.10. Con: If we protect any speech that does not instigate to commit crimes against a person or a group of people, we can have both our freedom and safety.
1.6.11. Con: The statement is ignorant of the law. For example, Hate has been objectively codified into California statutes sections 422.55, 422.6, 422.7, and 422.75 PC against Hate Bias. Hate Bias is precisely what is being communicated with hate speech.
1.6.12. Con: There is no such thing as hate speech, as an objective classification- only speech, which should be protected- period.
1.6.12.1. Con: Law deals with plenty of ambiguities. Threats, extortion, slander, and blackmail are all often delivered as speech acts -- these categories do not exist as "objective" classifications either.
1.6.13. Con: All speech is constitutionally protected \(in countries with freedom of speech\), with exclusions explicitly stated. All that is necessary to protect hate speech is to not explicitly state that it is excluded from the blanket protection on speech.
1.6.14. Pro: Not all speech is protected, so hate speech could become illegal if we could define it in the most concise manner. If the use of the "N" word is considered provocative and brings about violent reactions then certain words could be considered illegal to use.
1.6.14.1. Con: The [Heckler's veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler%27s_veto) should not be an argument and ought to not be allowed to dictate outcome of anything. The reaction to a word is responsibility of the reacting party, not the speaking one. Incitement to violence is an exception, that could still be debated.
1.7. Con: Legally protecting hate speech may lead to allowance and legal protection of 'hate induced actions' in certain jurisdictions in the world.
1.8. Con: Hate speech has no benefit to society whatsoever and can therefore be banned without harm.
1.8.1. Con: Hate speech legislation consistently applied would prevent expressions of severe contempt for things that are worthy it, thus harming society.
1.8.2. Con: Hate speech can bring awareness to underlying issues in society that may otherwise be hidden if it was not protected.
1.8.2.1. Con: There are different ways to unearth underlying issues/problems: people can express their opinions in a respectful manner.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: What is and what is not respectful is deeply subjective. In the end, packaging your perspective a certain way does not always prevent someone from being offended if that person takes offense at the different perspective itself.
1.8.2.1.2. Con: People can, but most often do not, especially when they are emotionally triggered, which is when their expression is often the most raw and authentic
1.8.3. Pro: Hate speech in an educated society harms the speaker more than his/her intended victims. The key to fighting hate speech is not in regulating it but in educating the society how to deal with it and other forms of communication abuse \(i.e. cyber-bullying\).
1.8.3.1. Con: It only 'harms the speaker more' because of the social/civil repercussions they face due to it not being legally protected. 
Where as in all contexts, hate speech harms the victim.
1.8.4. Con: All speech should be protected by default, due to the complexity and controversy of selecting an authority to determine what constitutes forbidden hate speech.
1.8.4.1. Pro: All speech on any topic has at least weak and indirect effects on policy that can add up to a matter of life or death for someone.
1.8.4.2. Con: Just because policy determination is complex does not mean that it should be avoided or that policy modification, retraction, or expansion should not occur. \([Negativity bias](https://yourbias.is/)\)
1.8.4.3. Con: The Southern Poverty Law Center is an [arguably well respected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/26/after-conservative-backlash-charity-tracker-guidestar-removes-hate-group-labels/?utm_term=.11576296e05a) [authority](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Southern-Poverty-Law-Center) in this field already.
1.8.4.3.1. Con: The Southern Poverty Law Center has itself created [controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center#Controversies_over_hate_group_and_extremist_listings) and [psychological harm](https://www.voiceofthevoiceless.info/i-was-traumatized-by-the-southern-poverty-law-centers-hate-campaign-against-ex-gays) by labeling those they disagree with \(including mainstream figures and organizations such as Ben Carson and the Family Research Council\) as "extremists," even though these so-called "extremists" do not advocate for persecution or harassment of those with whom they disagree.
1.8.4.3.1.1. Con: There is value in being able to make mistakes. No governing body, or individual is without their share of mistakes and repercussions. That is the reason why our legal systems have redundancies and methods of appeal.
1.8.4.3.2. Con: The splc is [currently facing litigation](http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2018/april/southern-poverty-law-center-deletes-list-of-anti-muslim-extremists-after-legal-threat) for defamation after listing Maajid Nawaz as an anti-Muslim extremest. Maajid Nawaz is a liberal Muslim who founded an anti-extremist think tank in the UK.
1.8.4.3.3. Pro: There are also areas of academia which focus on studying these issues and their effects on actors which would allow various governing bodies to make informed decisions on regulation.
1.8.4.4. Pro: No authority established by a majority could be guaranteed to protect the free speech rights of the minority.
1.8.4.4.1. Con: Uncurtailed free speech can incite hatred, mistreatment and even violence, especially against minority groups. It is more practical to curtail such speech in the first place.
1.8.4.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.12.6.4.4.
1.8.4.4.1.2. Pro: People should have the right to spaces where hate speech against them is not allowed. For example the family of a deceased black person should have the right to have a funeral without being harassed by the KKK.
1.8.4.5. Pro: Any speech that challenges the views of the majority \(or those in power\) could be classified as "hateful."
1.8.4.5.1. Pro: Recent [court cases cited by Amnesty International](https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/02/22/inenglish/1519292044_500937.html) \(and [others](https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/pablo-casta-o/free-speech-under-siege-in-spain)\) arguably show freedom of speech being arbitrarily restricted in Spain on the grounds of being too extreme or "[disrespectful](http://theconversation.com/spains-freedom-of-speech-repression-is-no-joke-75889)," especially in cases that are [critical of the government](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/world/europe/echr-spain-free-speech.html).
1.8.4.5.2. Pro: If hate speech is illegal, hateful things will seem more hateful than they already were, giving them power.
1.8.4.6. Pro: All speech is provocative.  An important part of the human experience is to confront, debate, discuss, and provide different perspectives. Without this, we are controlled, ruled, oppressed and dehumanised.
1.8.4.6.1. Pro: One of the most significant differences between humans and AI is in the ability of the former to consider context and weight up different perspectives. Bad interpretation is a result of lack of exposure to different contexts and little consideration.
1.8.4.7. Con: -> See 1.2.12.6.7.
1.8.5. Con: Hate speech reveals the biases of the speaker, providing critical information to potential employers, voters etc.
1.8.6. Pro: Adding the qualifier of "hate" makes it not speech. It makes it something used to negatively impact a person's thoughts or well being--either by enforcing a false narrative or depriving someone else of their right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, by using false and slanderous words to denigrate a person based on their uncontrollable status.
1.8.6.1. Con: There is no universally-recognized definition of "hate speech," so the qualifier of "hate" can't imply anything more than that one person or group finds it objectionable. [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/07/no-theres-no-hate-speech-exception-to-the-first-amendment/?utm_term=.b874b4085be1)
1.9. Con: According to the paradox of tolerance, enabling certain liberties may have an overall negative impact over freedom.
1.9.1. Con: The "paradox of tolerance" is viewpoint dependent. Hate speech laws are currently being used to silence dissent -- silence the very people pointing out the intolerance that we should be intolerant of.
1.9.2. Pro: Intolerant rhetoric often calls for explicitly or at least suggests the curtailing of liberties for certain other groups. Protecting hate speech places a society under the constant threat of having the liberties it prizes be undone.
1.9.3. Con: Man can not enable liberties, only disable liberties. Disabling liberties is done for the sake of 'safety/surety' - not for the sake of freedom.
1.9.3.1. Con: Disabling the liberty to limit other people liberties is beneficial for freedom.
1.9.4. Con: The solution to the paradox of tolerance is to speak out against the intolerance rather than legislate against them.
1.9.4.1. Con: The lie flies faster and farther than the rebuttal. If hate speech has incited deaths of some before the reasonable minded argument against it has entered the debate, you provided no solution to the paradox of tolerance.
1.9.5. Pro: Unlimited tolerance can lead to the extinction of tolerance. Defending tolerance requires to not tolerate the intolerant.
1.9.5.1. Pro: Ethically, you need only tolerate the tolerant.
Since hate speech is focused on attributes one is born with and thus not changeable, hate speech is by definition intolerant.
1.9.6. Con: The paradox of tolerance is not consistent, internally or externally, and applies to itself, thus negating it's impact entirely. We cannot tolerate the intolerant, has no meaning because it means you cannot tolerate the lack of tolerating the intolerant either. Since it cancels out it's own argument, it therefore is not a valid philosophy, or reasonable position.
1.9.7. Pro: Allowing all forms of speech, including hateful and violent speech will eventually lead to the immunity developing in our species to feeling affected by insult/hate speech, removing the bigger downsides to hate speech and allowing people to use hate speech to blow off steam reducing stress.
1.9.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.12.6.
1.9.9. Con: Karl Popper took the opposite stance when he came up with the idea of the Paradox of Tolerance in his book The Open Society And Its Enemies: "In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies ; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise." - pg 226
1.9.9.1. Con: Hate speech is seldom, if ever, rational. The notion that violence -- including violent language -- can be overcome with sheer rationality seems misguided. You cannot parry a fist with rhetoric.
1.10. Pro: Real, absolute freedom means the freedom to say anything you like, including hateful things.
1.10.1. Con: Being able to say things that incur violence inhibit other people's rights and freedom.
1.10.2. Con: This begs the question by assuming that absolute freedom of speech is desirable. It is not.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Allowing hate speech can cause psychological harm to those its directed towards.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.1.1.
1.10.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.1.2.
1.10.2.1.3. Con: Not knowing what others think of you, because those others are afraid of a state with a monopoly on force -- even what they think of you for unjustified reasons -- leads to worry and neurosis over what others think of oneself.
1.10.3. Con: We all are absolutely free to say and do what we like, but those things all come with both positive and negative consequences. Hate speech should be allowed until it becomes something more than speech itself.
1.10.3.1. Con: Speech is always more than 'speech itself' we have and cherish speech in its forms because of its ability to affect change in our fellows. Its the reason we read, write, and tell stories; watch movies; code games; etc.
1.10.4. Con: Free speech is already protected in most countries, but there is a very real and significant difference between free speech and hate speech. When free speech crosses the line into advocating harm \(even implicitly\) to others, usually vulnerable minorities, that legal protection quite rightly falls away.
1.10.4.1. Con: The problem with more and more of the "hate speech laws" is that they do not fight the speech that incites to harm, but instead they police the way people can speak. As it is with the now famous bill C-16 from Canada. [Bill c16 text](http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-16/first-reading)
1.10.4.2. Pro: Pro abortion arguments are hate speech because they advocate harm to people based on their age. Advocating the division and dismantling of Israel is hate speech because it is anti-semitic. Threatening to single out churches for taxation is hate speech because it advocates harm to people based on their beliefs. Saying it is ok to punch a Nazi is hate speech.
1.10.5. Con: If hate speech should be legally protected, then so should murder, rape, robbery, cannibalism and other types of crime committed in the name of freedom. Freedom cannot be absolute lest it becomes total anarchism.
1.10.5.1. Con: Hate speech is quite literally just words. Words can't compare  to brutal crimes until they form actual threats, like "I'll kill you".
1.10.5.1.1. Con: Actually there are several forms of 'speech' that are recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States that are literally not words. Flag burning being one such example.
1.10.5.1.1.1. Pro: And as an example, burning the US flag to protest policy instituted by the government is not hateful, nor does it threaten any specific person. Where as Burning the Pride Flag could be used to threaten an LGBTQ person/community. \(Just as burning the flag to threaten Americans would be\)
1.10.6. Pro: A belief in free speech, must necessarily mean a belief that all speech is equally legitimate and deserving of protection.
1.10.6.1. Con: Literally nowhere in the world is this true.
1.10.6.2. Con: Speech is not equally legitimate or innocent in itself, for example when it consist of lies about someone, and as a consequence that person loses his or her job it is clearly more than just speech and one should be liable for lying.
1.10.6.2.1. Con: Liability and illegality are different. Liability is responsiblity, and can be determined after the fact. Legality is determined prior to any action.
1.10.6.2.1.1. Pro: For example, it is legal to leave a knife on your table.  You become liable when a child grabs that knife and cuts his/herself.
1.10.6.2.1.1.1. Con: The idea is the same. The argument in the knife/child example would be that the child should have been kept from the knife or the knife should have been kept from the child. In the lying example, the arguments run parallel. The lie should be kept from the public, or the public should be kept from the lie.
1.10.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Whether the lie should be kept from the public or the public from the lie, there is a large difference in declaring that no speaches may be given due to a risk of a lie and holding the lier accountable for the results of the lie.
1.10.6.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: That is not the point that was argued. The point was that Not all speech is equal or equally legitimate, such as the case where lies are spread to degrade or dehumanize a group of people for example. Saying "all Catholics are pedophiles" is incorrect and spreads a lie based on the fact that "there have been numerous cases of pedophilia within the Catholic church"; the former being illegitimate and the form being fact.
1.10.6.2.2. Pro: Stating that all speech is equally legitimate would promote the idea that researched facts are as legitimate as conjecture or fiction.
1.10.6.2.2.1. Con: Statements are not necessarily facts and false statements from individuals or organizations can lead to permanent effects of said individual/organization's in regards to their views and future publications.
1.10.7. Con: Absolute freedom is not desirable because it necessarily infringes on the rights of others.
1.10.7.1. Con: We already have absolute freedom. It is our actions that have consequences. Infringing upon other peoples freedoms in order to prevent harm is overly assumptive, especially when it comes to speech.
1.10.7.1.1. Con: In practice the law allows some people to infringe upon other people's freedom. It is accepted by the majority of people because they think that it is better for them \(for example: police can stop a robber in action\). If many people think that hate speech is harmful, it wouldn't be "assumptive" to limit it: it would be only the will of the majority.
1.10.7.1.1.1. Con: The imposition of the will of a majority comes at the expense of a minority. \(Also referred to as "[tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority)."\)
1.10.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: Majority support of a policy will allow the largest number of people to benefit.
1.10.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Just because a group accepts a position doesn't mean mean that it will have the best outcome. \([Groupthink](https://yourbias.is/groupthink) bias.\)
1.10.7.2. Con: Moral standards may include some form of intolerance. Thereby, limiting freedom of speech would also limit freedom of religion.
1.10.7.3. Con: Speech does not have the capability to infringe upon rights. Actions infringe upon rights.
1.10.7.4. Pro: It makes sense to limit people's freedom to perform particular actions \(e.g. violence\) in order to protect other people's freedom from such actions \(the right to be free from violence\).
1.10.7.5. Pro: Society can only exist when individuals agree to trade off some freedoms in return for the ability to co-exist peacefully.
1.10.7.6. Pro: Hate speech relies on the idea that not all people are created equal and therefore cannot be legally protected.
1.11. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.
1.12. Pro: Making hate speech illegal sets a dangerous precedent, which could lead to curtailment of all speech.
1.12.1. Pro: Someone has to decide what constitutes hate-speech. Even with the best intentions this may lead to a bias, and with bad intentions this may lead to hate-speech laws being used to disproportionally silence specific ideas.
1.12.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.2.
1.12.1.2. Pro: A persons personal views \(bias\) filter what another says and can take away a message the speaker was not saying or twist the message. [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WMuzhQXJoY&t=791s)
1.12.1.3. Con: All actions \(especially hate speech\) have bias. Hate speech laws intentionally seek to silence ideas; ideas which seek to dehumanize, degrade, or exterminate innocent people
1.12.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.11.2.1.6.
1.12.1.5. Pro: Hate speech cannot be properly determined, thus a law around hate speech could be abused by all sides.
1.12.2. Con: Saying legitimate free speech indicates that there are prohibited arenas of speech.
1.12.2.1. Con: To say some speech is socially unacceptable does not mean it should be outlawed. If you grant the power to regulate some speech that power may be used against you if someone finds your speech offensive.
1.12.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.6.
1.12.3. Con: There are [many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech#Hate_speech_laws_by_country) where hate speech is illegal, but this has not led to any significant downsides in public deliberations or "curbs on legitimate free speech“.
1.12.3.1. Con: Count Dankula's case is an example of how laws that limit free speech can include even jokes when interpreted too broadly. [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Meechan)
1.12.3.2. Con: Russia has hate speech laws and [has been widely criticized for infringing on freedom of speech.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_freedom_in_Russia)
1.12.3.2.1. Con: Just because a country bans hate speech and has not expressed freedom, that does not mean there's a causal relation.
1.12.3.2.2. Con: These countries \(Russia/North Korea\) have banned freedom of expression, not just hate speech. Therefore, they shouldn't count as examples.
1.12.3.2.2.1. Pro: There is a large grey area between 'hate speech' and 'freedom of expression'.
North Korea and Russian governments could easily claim that allowing people to publish anti-government articles is 'hate speech' because it is inciting hatred towards a particular group \(the government\) without justification \(in their opinion\).
1.12.3.2.2.1.1. Con: In Russia a university was closed in retaliation for election monitoring by corrupt officials. Its [licence was suspended in 2008 for 'fire safety'](https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/dmitry-dubrovsky/closure-of-european-university-at-st-petersburg-dead-cert) due to, in part, a “previously unnoticed” cast iron staircase built in 1881. In 2018 it was again closed for [minor food safety violations](https://themoscowtimes.com/news/authorities-take-over-european-universitys-building-in-st-petersburg-60163). Authoritarian governments will always find a way to abuse the legal system, making sure that they don't is a matter of checks & balances - not by making a society free of consequences for harmful actions.
1.12.3.2.3. Con: Russia does not protect hate speech equally. It has laws that infringe upon the rights of the LGBT+ community, such as the [anti "gay propaganda"](https://www.dw.com/en/russia-aims-to-forbid-gay-propaganda/a-16551648) law \([which goes as far as shutting down local support groups](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/susiearmitage/leader-of-support-group-for-russian-lgbt-teens-fined-for-gay)\), a [temporarily mooted law that would prohibit transexuals from driving](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30735673), and [mass detentions and torture of gay men by local authorities in its Southern regions](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/05/no-justice-chechnyas-anti-gay-purge-victims),
1.12.3.2.4. Con: The supranational European Court of Human Rights [has upheld specific challenges on hate speech in Russia](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{%22itemid%22:\[%22001-79619%22\]}). Russia has wider problems within its society regarding freedom of speech, reducing protections for minorities \(such as Jews in the above case\) will not help this [when there are laws against homosexual propaganda](https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/10/russias-gay-propaganda-censor-attacks-health-website), and [regular murder of journalists](https://cpj.org/data/killed/europe/russia/?status=Killed&motiveConfirmed%5B%5D=Confirmed&type%5B%5D=Journalist&cc_fips%5B%5D=RS&start_year=1992&end_year=2018&group_by=location).
1.12.3.3. Con: There are examples of governments curbing speech throughout history. One of the most recent and better known is North Korea, though many others exist.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_North_Korea)[libertyinnorthkorea.org](https://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/learn-nk-challenges/)
1.12.3.3.1. Con: North Korea has little to no freedom of speech or expression, but no hate speech laws in the same way that we are discussing. There may be laws against criticism of the government, its values or narrative, but there is no record of North Koreans being convicted for racism, homophobia, sexism etc.
1.12.3.4. Con: There is often a deliberate attempt to conflate opposition to the actions of the government of Israel with anti-semitism. As a result, some countries have [taken action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott,_Divestment_and_Sanctions#Responses_by_other_governments) against the BDS movement based on hate speech. Many would see this as a clear case of using hate speech law to curb legitimate free speech.
1.12.3.5. Pro: Whatever the law says is legitimate cannot be illegal.
1.12.3.6. Pro: Any course of action may be justified as long as there are no significant harms.
1.12.4. Pro: In the U.S. there are already examples of curbed speech. e.g. yelling fire in a crowded space, death threats against the president.
1.12.4.1. Con: It is not actually illegal to yell fire in a crowded theatre. The phrase is merely an example Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes used to justify his [decision](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/11/its-time-to-stop-using-the-fire-in-a-crowded-theater-quote/264449/) in US v Schenk.
1.12.5. Con: Free speech is not a holy grail to defend at all costs and many countries already implement laws curbing free speech for the greater good of the society.
1.12.6. Con: The parent argument is a slippery slope argument, which is a logical fallacy unless it is substantiated by why it is indeed very likely that making hate speech illegal will lead to arbitrary curbs.
1.12.6.1. Con: US history has created a basis for slippery slope argument. Examples include gun legislation and abortion. In those circumstances, the cases presiding \(2nd amendment judgments as a prime example\) decided that limitation was allowed, and since then more laws have been allowed due to this. Under the circumstances, limiting free speech based on "Hate" enables subjective qualifications. Subjectivity would be the mechanism for the slippery slope.
1.12.6.1.1. Con: This constitutes cherry-picking. There are [plenty of places in which hate speech is illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech#Hate_speech_laws_by_country) which have not descended down the slippery slope; likewise there is obviously plenty of American legislation that has not descended a slippery slope.
1.12.6.1.1.1. Con: The suggestion of cherry picking is disingenuous as the parent argument defined the mobility and viability of the slippery slope argument. It did not say it was certain to happen, but it instead pointed to the mechanism which was the premise of the grandfather argument. There was no cherry picking.
1.12.6.1.2. Con: Criminalizing hate speech has [worked in other countries.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech#Hate_speech_laws_by_country)Just because the mechanism is available doesn't mean it will happen.
1.12.7. Con: Protecting hate speech sets a more dangerous precedent. It makes people feel like they have the right to marginalize groups of people, which has historically made way for various other legal conflicts \(e.g police violence\)
1.12.8. Pro: There are only 2 types of speech, free speech and state limited speech imposed through force.
1.12.9. Pro: In countries with limits to free speech, people have been arrested for making a joke. Abuses due to restrictions on free speech has happened in the past and continues today.
1.12.9.1. Con: Limits to free speech have also been used to oppress minorities such as with the current Russian anti-propaganda laws, which censor the work of LGBTQ+ activists and allies in the country. The responsibility lies with the people to ensure that these restrictions either aren't put in place or aren't being used to oppress people.
1.12.9.2. Con: Adding limits to speech does not necessarily lead to all speech being limited. The United State already has several limits to free speech for the safety of the public, while keeping most types of speech free.
1.12.9.2.1. Pro: Wikipedia lists 8 distinct types of speech which are limited or sanctioned within the United States, including libel, slander, incitement to suicide or violence, commercial speech \(i.e., what can be communicated in advertisements\), and threats of violence. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions)
1.12.10. Pro: The term "hate speech" varies based on culture and politics. Allowing the government to dictate what is legally considered hate speech, could easily be abused for political and social power
1.12.10.1. Pro: One such example is the anti islamophobia motion in Canada, [motion 103](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_103), there is no comparable motions for judeaphobia and christianophobia. Though the motion is not legally binding, it sets an example for how a government can give preferential treatment over other groups if hate speech laws are implemented.
1.12.10.2. Pro: Political lobbyism can easily work through this channel.
1.12.10.3. Con: Suggesting that there is a slippery slope to what the government can define as hate speech presumes that we as a society have no impact on government policy.
1.12.10.3.1. Con: In the UK recently there have been protests and demonstrations against British laws and actions. These acts state their interests are not represented and that they are perceiving a big enough threat to sacrifice their time to demonstrate their view. [Tommy Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nJjM41VseE) [Count Dankula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcG2cCUR7C4)
1.12.10.3.2. Con: Romanians [felt they had no influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%932018_Romanian_protests) on their government.
1.12.10.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.2.1.
1.12.10.3.4. Con: The Brexit referendum campaigners are not representing leave voters' interests.
1.12.10.3.4.1. Pro: It is now clear that some of the possible models for leaving that were discussed in the referendum are no longer on offer.
1.12.10.3.4.1.1. Pro: Nigel Farage, Arron Banks, and other prominent "leavers" [made it appear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xGt3QmRSZY) that we could leave the EU while remaining in the single market, and some voters would have made their decision on this basis.  This however has been removed as an option by the Conservative government.  If this was known in advance of the referendum, the vote may have gone differently.
1.12.10.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Farage et al did not make it appear we could stay in the single market. The video cited above uses selective editing to lie about what was being said by those leave campaigners. Here is an exposé [Anatomy of a smear](https://www.kingdomcomment.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-smear-dan-hannan) .  The propaganda machine is gearing up to manipulate people who voted remain.
1.12.10.3.4.1.1.2. Con: Anyone with any sense would realise that leaving the EU would also mean leaving the common or single market and customs union. To believe people did not understand this is an insult to peoples intelligence.
1.12.10.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Daniel Hannan on [free trade](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/final-say-brexit-referendum-lies-boris-johnson-leave-campaign-remain-a8466751.html#explainer-question-5): "Absolutely nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single market". Daniel Hannan on [immigration policy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCghi2rVaWY): "It doesn't mean free movement of people, but free movement of labor , it doesn't mean EU citizenship with all the acquired rights"
1.12.10.3.4.1.1.2.2. Con: Liam Fox [on free trade](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/final-say-brexit-referendum-lies-boris-johnson-leave-campaign-remain-a8466751.html#explainer-question-1): "The free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history". Liam Fox on [immigration policy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4k8cZOUd5g) : "I would call an open and shut immigration policy"
1.12.10.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: [Oliver Norgrove](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/08/if-brexit-was-vote-leave-single-market-why-didnt-campaigners-say-so), a former Vote Leave staffer, wrote that "we argue for things which are utterly achievable in the EEA and make no mention at all of leaving the single market"
1.12.10.3.4.1.1.3.1. Con: The views of Oliver Norgrove, who hardly anyone has ever heard of, are hardly relevant. Even he acknowledges in the cited source that both Leave and Remain campaigns said that it was a vote to leave the single market.
1.12.10.3.4.1.1.3.2. Con: Oliver Norgrove was not a prominent leaver.
1.12.10.3.4.1.1.4. Pro: Boris Johnson wrote in his column for [The Telegraph](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-single-market-brexit-a7104846.html) that Britain "will still have access to the single market"
1.12.10.3.4.1.1.5. Con: Every prominent brexiteer said that a vote to leave would be a vote to end free movement of people. The EU has made clear that free movement of people must be accepted by countries in the single market. The single market must therefore be left.
1.12.10.3.4.1.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.12.10.3.4.1.1.2.1.
1.12.10.3.4.1.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.12.10.3.4.1.1.2.2.
1.12.11. Con: If "hate speech" is by definition very bad, the reverse could be true. If we allow hate speech but keep serious punitive deterrents for other crimes, our laws are inconsistent - a dangerous precedent.
1.12.12. Pro: -> See 1.10.6.
1.12.13. Con: The lack of hate speech laws historically led to the curtailment of all speech \(opposite to parent claim\). The British colonial laws were forms of hate speech because Aboriginal land was taken over by British colonists on the premise that the land belonged to no-one \(‘terra nullius’ = Aboriginals not Human\). The removal of Hate speech legislation means that victims of violence incited by, or victims who's human rights have been removed by hate speech will no longer be protected by law.
1.13. Pro: Hate speech may act as a much needed corrective for some people who's actions, customs, beliefs, and practices are considered by some people to be worthy of expressions of hatred, such words may act as alert for attention, for revision and maybe reconsideration by the bearer.
1.13.1. Con: This is a conditional. This doesn't argue that all hate speech should be acceptable, but that some should. Murder is illegal, but justifiable homocide still exists. Similarly, removing legal protections for hate speech in general doesn't mean there can't be exceptions.
1.13.1.1. Con: Murder is a physical act and violation of others' rights. Hate speech does not violate anyone's rights. It is a logical fallacy to compare speech to physical interaction. All hate speech could be useful in the described manner, so one can not rule out any use.
1.13.1.2. Con: If some hate speech is appropriate some of the time, then it must all be allowed all the time.  Otherwise its a soft ambiguous rule that can be bent for the benefit of whoever can afford the more expensive lawyer or whichever group has the socio-political leverage to define what hate speech is.  We have to protect our right to criticize bad ideas.
1.14. Con: In order for a peaceful and democratic debate to flourish, only respectful arguments should be allowed.
1.14.1. Con: There is no single definition of what a respectful argument would be in every possible debate. Nobody has the authority to discredit an argument as not respectful based on subjective opinion.
1.14.2. Con: Permitting only respectful arguments is not realistic in the rough-and-tumble of a healthy democracy. Since rights and interests are constantly at odds, it is impossible even to articulate certain viewpoints without appearing to disrespect contrary viewpoints \(or the people who hold them\).
1.14.2.1. Con: Even controversial opinions may be expressed politely and in a manner that would be perceived as respectful to the average reasonable person.
1.14.2.1.1. Con: Hate speech laws do not provide the technical background of what a "average reasonable person" is. These laws provide only a legal way for anyone who feels offended to legally block the viewpoints of someone else.
1.14.2.1.1.1. Con: [The reasonable person](http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/The%20Many%20Faces%20of%20the%20Reasonable%20Person.pdf) is a standard that is very clearly defined in law and has been used in a wide range of different legal arguments.
1.14.2.1.1.2. Pro: It is in fact a dictatorship of the ones who are most vocal about whatever they feel is not appropriate to them.
1.14.2.2. Pro: Respect is a subjective measure used to maintain the status quo. Any view that rejects the orthodoxy of society, will be labeled as disrespectful.
1.14.3. Con: You can always just ignore something if you think it's hateful. If the majority ignores it, it will fade away. No need to make it illegal.
1.14.3.1. Con: "If the majority ignores it" is the key sentence here. The argument works only if the people, who practice hate speech have no power over you - otherwise unregulated hate speech can spiral into violence.
1.14.3.1.1. Con: There is no evidence that hate speech would spiral into violence under those circumstances.
1.14.3.1.1.1. Con: Every [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide) that has ever happened is proof to that. The [Rhwandan](https://www.history.com/topics/rwandan-genocide) one had hatespeech pouring out of one of it's national radio stations encouraging Hutus to go out and slaughter Tutsis.
1.14.3.1.2. Con: Just because the hate speech "can" spiral into violence does not justify suppressing it. We can better focus the resources on suppressing actual violence.
1.14.3.1.2.1. Con: That depends on what resources are used to quell the aftermath of violence incited by hate speech. In WWII, the resources used were peoples lives. Without hate speech laws, violence against innocent parties could only be prevented with military force.
1.14.4. Con: Painful though hate speech may be for individual members of minorities or other targeted groups, its toleration is to their great collective benefit, because in a climate of free intellectual exchange hateful and bigoted ideas are refuted and discredited, not merely suppressed. \([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/04/a-new-argument-for-hate-speech-laws-um-no/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.97701f5b747c)\)
1.14.4.1. Con: Often times attempts to refute and discredit hate speech are interpreted as suppression, meaning that the benefits of open communication are somewhat limited.
1.14.5. Con: If we respect the feelings of others we cannot put forward inconvenient truths that need to be expressed.
1.14.5.1. Con: Inconvenient truths are not the same thing as hate speech. Respectfulness is about the choice of words, not about content.
1.14.5.1.1. Pro: Hate speech is invariably associated with scientific or historic falsehoods. It often involves the concept of race, nationalistic or ethnical stereotyping, sexual bigotry, or religious zeal negating rationally emerging truths. As such, it is disingenuous and, on this basis,  it should be denounced and banned from the public discourse.
1.14.5.1.1.1. Con: Simply because something is factually incorrect does not necessitate that it should be banned from public discourse.
1.14.5.1.2. Con: This is not the general definition of hate speech. Hate speech is also judged based on the content. As an example, security personnel who suggest more stringent standards for screening for certain ethnic groups, or academics who claim that different ethnicities have biological intelligence differences are often castigated and accused of hate speech, regardless of their tone or word choice. Thus, hate speech regulations prevent a public examination of the objective merits of their proposals.
1.14.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.2.2.
1.14.5.3. Con: Truths can be exposed without being hateful unless they are innately hateful. For example, it is not hateful to suggest the the Fore people's cannibalistic practices spread [kuru](https://www.healthline.com/health/kuru#prevention) disease. But suggesting that they are uncivilized or dirty for their own culture is.
1.14.5.3.1. Con: The Fore people could easily argue that this statement is hate speech.
1.14.6. Con: If people are allowed to express their hatred their views can then be addressed and challenged. This is part of the process of groups learning to understand and tolerate each other.
1.14.6.1. Pro: To develop an effective anti-venom, one must first have a rigid understanding of the venom itself. Making hate speech illegal considerably limits the opportunity of furthering the understanding of the mechanisms behind a 'hate' mindset.
1.14.6.2. Con: If we define hate speech as encouraging extremely detrimental acts, such as murder, violence and rape, then it should be stated clearly that even thinking that any of those actions are socially acceptable is wrong, and banning such speech would be a good place to start. Expressing an unpopular or controversial opinion is a separate subject.
1.14.7. Con: The constitution doesn't guarantee our right to be treated respectfully.
1.14.8. Pro: People who cannot express themselves in a rational manner that is respectful towards their audience, even on issues with which they vehemently disagree, are not mature enough to participate in debate.
1.14.8.1. Con: Completely preventing someone from participating in a debate simply because of their perceived immaturity or the inappropriateness of their opinion goes against the ideals of a free society, and was used to justify preventing many groups throughout history from being allowed to vote. \(Women, immigrants, the poor, the youth, racial minorities, etc.\) [Source](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy)
1.14.8.2. Con: People mature in debate by joining debate, making errors, and being called on them \(and feeling shame afterwards\). Not by criminal or civil prosecutions.
1.14.8.3. Con: Those people are mature enough to vote, so we are better off knowing how they feel.
1.14.9. Pro: The governmental permission of hate speech, particularly against democratically under-represented groups, can lead to alienation and segregation, which is not conducive to a healthy, cooperative and collaborative society. This consequentially makes the democratic process more easily hijacked by fascism and identity politics.
1.14.9.1. Con: Controlling what people can and can not say in the public forum is far closer to Fascism than any slippery slope suggests.
1.14.9.1.1. Con: Only fascists insist on government protections for intimidating others otherwise known as hate speech.
1.14.9.2. Con: This claim is an [appeal to emotion](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-emotion) and lacks supporting evidence. In fact, there is evidence to the contrary. For example, the United States has experienced measurable [desegregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desegregation#Modern_history) since [Brown v. Board of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education) \(1954\) without any need for limitation on the First Amendment.
1.15. Con: People currently don't have good methods to shield themselves from hate speech online or in society, so it is best to ban.
1.15.1. Con: People are already able to choose what information to consume.
1.15.1.1. Con: Nobody has the ability to stop themselves either seeing or hearing hate speech since they must have already seen or heard it to determine that it was hate speech. However, everyone has the ability to stop themselves from speaking or writing it.
1.15.2. Con: It is unreasonable to demand insulation from ideas we find uncomfortable. There is no practical way to implement this kind of censorship without an authoritarian bent, which is contrary to the ideals of a liberal society.
1.15.3. Pro: Hate speech has become a constant threat online, thus it should be regulated.
1.15.3.1. Pro: The press and broadcasters are held accountable by laws and regulators. Any online content that can be viewed or read by the public should adhere to the same regulations, standards and accountability. Content should be aged rated and the identity of the person responsible for the content made very clear.
1.15.3.1.1. Con: Press and broadcasters are paid professionals that are meant to convey information to the public. Online content is free of that burden and is only under specific arrangement paid for.
1.15.3.1.2. Con: Mainstream media is family-friendly setting, so regulated content is a norm. Content on alternative media and the main social sites is not meant to be family-friendly. There are exclusive forums and sites for this.
1.15.3.1.2.1. Pro: Social platforms only give you access to promoted content, which is by default safe or targets specific population groups. It is entirely up to the user to choose whether he wants to be exposed to something otherwise restricted via other sources.
1.15.3.1.2.2. Pro: In the same way people decide on which TV channels would be appropriate for their family, people online ought to choose what websites they visit and what content they subscribe to.
1.15.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: You will not be able to see explicit content on Facebook if you do not subscribe to channels or befriend people that have access to such.
1.15.3.2. Pro: Hate speech online becomes amplified very fast which can feel extremely threatening to victims.
1.15.3.3. Con: Some opinionated language online is easily misinterpreted as hate speech.
1.15.3.3.1. Pro: There is a difference between threatening someone, insulting them and "hate speech". A direct threat should not be acceptable \(i.e. "I am going to find you and hurt you"\). An insult can vary in intensity and people can take them differently, between friends an insult like "you're an idiot" can be made in jest, whilst someone with which you are unfamiliar could be offended. Hate speech is more open to interpretation and can hold less intent than a direct threat or insult.
1.15.3.3.2. Pro: Hate speech is sometimes obvious, sometimes not obvious. Anti-semitic, fascist remarks are clearly defined as hate speech and easily identifiable, but the line gets fuzzy as we get closer to the present. We are all people of our time.
1.15.3.3.2.1. Pro: We only see the past and some of the present. Current issues cannot be reliably categorized into hate speech and not hate speech, therefore we must legally protect possible hate speech in order to better figure out pressing matters of our times.
1.15.3.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.2.9.1.
1.15.3.4. Con: The internet allows for interactions across the world, different parts of the world are subject to different laws, meaning that regulation becomes difficult.
1.15.3.4.1. Con: Laws are meant to regulate the populace within the geopolitical structures they were made in. Just because we can't police the entire global population does not mean that laws are not necessary or valuable in effecting change in our own societies.
1.15.3.5. Con: Hate speech being prevalent does not imply that hate speech should be censored.
1.15.3.6. Con: [Cyberstalking is already legislated.](https://legaldictionary.net/cyberstalking/) Other forms of communications \(Like comments\) can easily be ignored or blocked.
1.15.3.7. Con: Hate speech online comes from a certain amount of anonymity and the indirect nature of most online communication. As such, it is practically impossible to regulate expressing opinions online.
1.15.3.8. Con: The distance of online communications makes threat's less compelling and believable and hence less worthy of regulation than face-to-face speech.
1.15.3.8.1. Pro: The less compelling nature of it is understood by most parties and provokes more hate speech exclusively because of no consequences assumed. If an individual takes it differently, that is entirely his mistake and only he ought to be subject to it.
1.15.3.8.1.1. Pro: The lack of effect from the provoked hate speech enables it to be used as a vent in order to avoid use in real life, where it may have consequences. Thus it is a good alternative.
1.15.3.9. Pro: Between August 2015 and July 2016, the Anti-Defamation League \(ADL\) reported 2.6 million tweets containing anti-Semitic language targeting journalists \([pg. 2](https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/press-center/CR_4862_Journalism-Task-Force_v2.pdf)\)
1.15.3.9.1. Con: In 2015-16 there were more than 300 million active monthly users with over 500,000,000 tweets per day, this means that if all 2.6 million potentially anti-semetic tweets were sent in one day they would represent approximately 0.5% of traffic and over the time span of a year would represent less than 0.001% of tweets. \([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/), [www.internetlivestats.com](http://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/)\)
1.15.3.9.2. Con: Tweets containing anti-semetic language may not be anti-semetic.
1.15.3.9.3. Con: The ADL has no authority, or credibility outside of the bubble of people who believe them.
1.16. Pro: Attempts to censor "hate speech" can in many ways actually strengthen the side of "hate speech" and sway public opinion/sympathy in their favor.
1.16.1. Pro: Allowing hate speech may actually contribute to exposing its inconsistencies.
1.16.1.1. Con: Why someone hates is not always consistent or logical. Exposing it therefore, may not bring about any resolution.
1.16.1.2. Con: -> See 1.10.2.1.
1.16.1.3. Con: Airing of hate speech in order to critique it is only possible if all involved agree on the same standards for logic and reason.
1.16.1.3.1. Con: If they don't, that makes a robust debate all the more important.
1.16.1.3.2. Con: A lot of times the people who support hate speech laws are irrational and act only according to their feelings. I do not see who will make the standards of logic and reason in your claim. Are people like the one with [yellow headpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-IFcCY0m3E) the new banner-bearers of logic and reason?
1.16.1.3.3. Con: The condition that all involved adhere to the same standards for logic and reason does not seem necessary to the mechanism of the parent claim.  So long as more people are persuaded against hateful ideas by the critique than are persuaded for them by hearing those hateful ideas, the parent claim would hold.
1.16.1.4. Pro: As hate comes from lack of knowledge, the expression of hate speech will be opposed by arguments and knowledge and therby make the hate lessor as the hateful are more informed.
1.16.1.5. Con: Logic and reason cannot change the opinions of someone who is not willing to listen to logic or reason. Internet trolls certainly fall into this category.
1.16.1.6. Pro: Addressing the faulty rationalizations that underlay a pathological belief publicly can give the observing public the argumentative structure to argue against those ideas in more personal circumstances.
1.16.1.7. Pro: When people are allowed to express their views, other people are able to explain why they are incorrect.
1.16.1.7.1. Pro: This can help change the mind of those making the hate speech, or at the very least encourage them to look at their views from a different perspective.
1.16.1.7.1.1. Con: This can be done in tandem to civil penalties, which would more strongly reinforce the issues with their beliefs/speech.
1.16.1.7.2. Con: This will likely result in tension since their view is being challenged.
1.16.1.7.2.1. Con: Societies have worked out civilized ways to challenge each others ideas without rising tension leading to violence, such as debates and democracy.
1.16.1.7.3. Pro: Hate speech should be allowed so that it can generate a public debate in which it will be defeated by reason, so that everyone can have access to the reasonings that prove hate speech wrong.
1.16.1.7.4. Con: Hitler freely expressed his views, which ultimately led to the removal of free speech altogether. The Jews were not allowed a chance to oppose him, most ending up dead.'
1.16.1.7.4.1. Pro: Hate speech legislation would prevent those like Hitler, who use public speaking as an opportunity to seize power over people's freedom, liberty, and free speech the chance to do so.
1.16.2. Pro: You never have to wonder where you stand with people who aren't afraid of free speech.
1.16.3. Con: The number of people who are swayed by this suppression is fewer than those who will be reached by hate speech if it is unchecked.
1.16.4. Con: The possibility of some people feeling sympathetic towards those whose hate speech is suppressed is less urgent than the real damage done to people who are the victims of that hate speech.
1.16.4.1. Con: The victims of hate speech will only be helped in the short term, but will suffer more in the long term. Without unconstrained discussions, hate will likely persist.
1.16.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.1.1.
1.17. Con: Hate speech is by definition more than speech; as it is explicitly an attempt at intimidation or the incitement of violence it must always be prohibited.
1.17.1. Con: That is not the case here in Australia. The Racial Discrimination Act 1975: "… unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person, or of some or all of the people in the group." Mere offence suffices.
1.17.2. Con: Hate speech does not explicitly call for the incitement of violence. Speech can be hateful, but if it is not accompanied by a threat legally define already as presenting a clear and present danger, then it is in fact not calling for violence, therefore should be overlooked, or confronted with debate instead of censorship.
1.17.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.12.6.3.1.3.
1.17.4. Con: The violent actions associated with hate speech are illegal, not the speech itself, therefore the part of it that isn't in any way actually harmful should be allowed.
1.17.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.1.1.1.
1.17.5. Con: Hate speech in modern uses is not clearly defined as stated above. Speech which incites violence is already illegal and therefore needs no new law to ban it.
1.17.5.1. Con: Hate speech can be speech that incites violence, too. Under the premise of this debate hate speech which incites violence would be legally protected. If all hate speech is indiscriminately legally protected, then states will be unable to prosecute hate speech which also incites violence.
1.17.5.1.1. Con: This claim is recursive. Speech either is or isn't hate speech, and does or doesn't incite violence. If it incites violence, it is illegal regardless of whether it is hate speech or not.
1.17.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.9.2.1.
1.17.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.12.6.4.4.2.1.
1.17.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.12.6.4.4.
1.18. Con: Defamation laws can easily be circumvented for members of vunerable communities without hate speech laws.
1.18.1. Pro: As an example, a school hires openly gay teacher calling him a pedofile ia defamation but picketing outside the school against hiring homosexuals because they \(the group\) are pedofiles is not defamation and therefore laws against hate speech is needed to uphold equality under the law.
1.19. Con: Hate speech laws decreases violence between ethnic communities.
1.19.1. Con: The violence is not due to the hate speech, but rather correlated with those ethnic groups' higher crime rates in pretty much every mixed country. [Crime rate in the US](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217#qf-headnote-a) [Crime rate UK from 2016 statistics](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/669094/statistics_on_race_and_the_criminal_justice_system_2016_v2.pdf) \([-crime rate chart](http://prntscr.com/kwztqd) at focus\) [Integration causality](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229686686/download)
1.19.2. Pro: There is a link between hate speech and racially-motivated violence, [according to this 2015 study](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/01/12/in-germany-online-hate-speech-has-real-world-consequences). [The results of this 2018 review](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/crschwarz/fanning-flames-hate.pdf) also implied that "in the absence of anti-refugee posts on the AfD Facebook page 316 \(9%\) fewer anti-refugee incidents would have taken place".
1.19.2.1. Con: The findings of the initial source display causal inference\(unreasonably declaring causality of a mere correlation\) and selection bias.
1.19.2.1.1. Pro: When we control for selection bias it is easily observable. The bias in the sample is people that react violently and credit is given to a sought causality, rather than observation\(claim for causality being any form of provocative speech, be it hate, insult or rational criticism\).
1.19.2.1.2. Pro: Including a counterfactual is one good tool to clarify the finding results. A counterfactual would be a similar group that also commits hate crime or violent crime, but is not exposed to hate speech.
1.19.2.1.3. Pro: Hate speech is [not proven](https://quillette.com/2018/01/18/hate-speech-not-induce-hatred/) to induce hatred and therefore can't be claimed causal for hate crime.
1.19.2.1.3.1. Pro: "There is no evidence that “hate speech” by ordinary persons has any effect on violence whatsoever." - Once authority or peer pressure is taken out of the equation, hate speech loses any claim for causality on hate and therefore violence.
1.19.2.1.4. Pro: Study claims causality without controlling the results for inference from the established causality of ghetto formation or other forms of foreign culture isolationism and absence of integration. The causality claim is then non-credible.
1.19.2.2. Con: -> See 1.6.
1.20. Pro: Criminalizing hate speech merely drives it underground.
1.20.1. Con: When hate speech is driven underground, it does not reach the ears of people who are more susceptible to harmful persuasive arguments, and does not permeate into the status quo of language in our society, making it a less effective tool for causing harm.
1.20.1.1. Con: Driving hate speech underground stops it being logically and intelligently challenged so those that do hear it have nothing to compare it against and so are more likely to believe it is correct and so aid its spread.
1.20.1.2. Con: Much the same way that telling kids that something is "for grownups" and "they won't want to do it" makes them totally uninterested in it.
1.20.1.3. Con: The goal should not be to avoid people coming into contact with harmfully persuasive arguments, it should be to arm them with the skills to resist them. Otherwise, when environments arise where these arguments can be made unchallenged, they will be more prone to falling for them.
1.20.1.4. Pro: One of the main tenants and operations of hate speech organizers like the neo-nazis is to prey on individuals, especially the youth, in order to indoctrinate them into furthering their hateful agenda. It is advantageous to both prevent these groups from reaching at risk individuals, as well as to elevate and educate those individuals to think in a positive way. There will always be individuals who are susceptible to hateful mentalities, but there doesn't have to be groups that perpetuate them.
1.20.1.4.1. Con: These people will push their agendas regardless of legality. Having them in the open makes it possible to control what they do and act accordingly to sway public opinions for the better.
1.20.1.5. Pro: The goal is not to hide hate speech from people, but to dissuade its use in society.
1.20.1.5.1. Pro: Hate speech, and the political and societal discourse that surrounds it, should be discussed with everyone openly. People should be allowed to express their hateful views as a manifestation of their psychological distress, not as a means to furthering a political agenda.
1.20.1.6. Pro: Driving hate speech organizations underground allows individuals with hateful thoughts the opportunity to go to reputable sources of help with their problems.
1.20.1.6.1. Con: Suppression, making things forbidden, makes them more attractive not less.  See the attractiveness of banned books or the Streisand effect. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)
1.20.2. Pro: Prohibition often exacerbates problematic behaviour.
1.20.2.1. Con: Prohibition drives the problematic behavior underground. When it comes to hate speech, we don't need to eliminate racism. It is sufficient to prevent its expression in public discourse.
1.20.2.1.1. Pro: The removal of hate speech from public discourse has a downstream effect on culture, making the propagation of racist ideas harder.
1.20.2.1.2. Con: Public discourse itself is not the issue - what matters with hate speech is its manifest effect in terms of inciting actual acts which hare prejudicial to the subjects of such hate speech. In other words if eliminating hate speech does not incrementally reduce \(for example\) racism then banning it serves no meaningful purpose.
1.20.2.1.3. Con: Driving it underground can strenghten it as well. In stead of adressing problems that lead to hate speech, this proposes to ignore them. The following frustration strenghtens and multiplies the underlying problems, rather than solving them
1.20.2.2. Pro: Hate speech functions as a warning for problems within society. Forbidding the warnings does not cease the consequences from occurring.
1.20.2.2.1. Pro: Critisizing the leader is usually highly illegal in most brutal dictatorship. It never stopped the revolution. In democracies governments can be critizised, enabling them to change course before public angers becomes too big.
1.20.2.3. Pro: When racist people are unable to express their opinion,  perceive themselves as victims of oppression by the government and double down on their opinions.
1.20.2.4. Pro: If people cannot voice controversial or offensive opinions, those opinions cannot be challenged by others, and are hence likely to persist in society.
1.20.2.5. Pro: For example, criminal activity and the illegal manufacturing and smuggling of alcohol increased once the [Prohibition Act](https://www.history.com/topics/prohibition) began in the 1920s.
1.20.2.5.1. Con: Despite this increase in activity, the Prohibition [was successful](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470475/)in lowering alcohol consumption and retaining political support. It is likely making hate speech illegal can have a similar affect.
1.20.2.5.1.1. Con: While prohibition may successfully reduce the expression of hate speech in public, it will not change the attitudes and views that led people to want to express hate speech in the first place.
1.20.2.6. Pro: When people are prosecuted for hate speech, they will merely engage in that speech behind closed doors or within private echo-chambers that are likely to reinforce their offensive views.
1.20.2.6.1. Con: People are allowed to have their own views and perspectives within the privacy of their own home. This is decidedly better than hatred being expressed publicly.
1.20.2.6.2. Pro: If people's rational hatreds are reinforced, they are more likely to commit hate crimes, even if they are illegal.
1.20.2.6.2.1. Con: There is no evidence to support this assertion that banning or opposing hateful rhetoric increases hate crimes. In fact the rhetoric and election of Donald Trump - who has be documented on numerous occasions engaging in hate speech - is linked with a sharp uptick of hate crime.
1.20.2.6.2.2. Con: These actors already understand that their actions are not supported by the public, hence the need for their isolated echo chambers.
1.20.2.6.3. Pro: Such actors can still hurt minorities by by voting for anti-minority candidates in elections.
1.20.3. Con: Driving hate speech underground limits its ability to propagate, slowing or reversing it's spread over time
1.20.4. Con: If the hate speech is shown to be deceptive and the proponent gains from that deception, then property laws should be applied.
1.20.5. Pro: Expression \(and intellectual entertainment\) of bad ideas is critical to their collaborative condemnation in a dialectic.
1.20.5.1. Pro: People who are ignorant of arguments for/against bad ideas cannot refute them.
1.20.5.1.1. Pro: People who cannot refute bad ideas are vulnerable to propaganda.
1.20.5.1.1.1. Con: Often people are targeted by propaganda for other reasons, such as being depressive, or harboring a sense of ostracization from society/peers.
1.20.5.1.2. Con: People can be educated about the rhetoric of hate speech and its effects without permitting people to open express hate speech without repercussions. Just as people learn of the holocaust and its propaganda without having people promote or express its ideals.
1.20.5.1.3. Con: Exposing people to hate speech is not a sufficient condition to allow its refutation.  People must be made fluent in critical analysis first. Then hate speech is to be presented as an exercise into criticism. Simple protection of hate speech does not lead to such an exercise.
1.20.5.1.3.1. Pro: Exposure to hate speech is necessary, but not sufficient to understanding why it is wrong.
1.20.5.2. Con: Historically, bad ideas do take root, when presented by a gifted speaker. From Nazism to Fascism to Communism, humans have a history of formulating a hateful ideology, then selling it to people on the fence through demagoguery, leading to negative outcomes such as sectarian violence, mass-murder, war and slavery.
1.20.5.2.1. Con: These groups rose to power in most cases by shutting down the free speech of their opposition. Free speech is a tool that can resist tyranny as well as advocate for it.
1.20.5.3. Con: You can have an intellectual/academic examination of rhetoric without publicly espousing it.
1.20.5.3.1. Con: Anyone with minor changes to their speech can claim it to be merely an intellectual/academic examination of rhetoric and have a free loophole in the law.
1.20.5.3.1.1. Con: Academic rhetoric is still reviewed and monitored. One can not simply create academic rhetoric without contributing and referencing existing academic discourse.
1.20.5.3.2. Con: Expressing and espousing are radically different things. A mark of an intellectual is the ability to entertain an idea without adopting it.
1.20.5.4. Con: This claim re-frames hate speech as “bad ideas” where as it is actually an act of targeted intimidation which can only be interpreted as violence.
1.20.5.4.1. Con: "Violence" has a meaning. It is a deliberate physical attack against someone or something. Anything other than that, while it might be criticized or condemned, is not properly called "violence".
1.20.6. Pro: -> See 1.20.2.6.
1.20.7. Pro: People often get around hate speech laws by "dog whistling" and using innocuous language an terms to express the same hateful intent.
1.20.7.1. Pro: When people "dog whistle" they are able to deny to themselves the fact that they are engaging in hate speech.
1.20.7.1.1. Pro: People are more likely to engage in unacceptable behaviour when they don't have to acknowledge that the behaviour is unacceptable.
1.20.7.2. Con: "Dog whistling" is better than hate speech itself because it does not promote the use of hateful words. It is up to the public to identify it as hateful, and it is not subjecting individuals to psychologically harmful language like hate speech.
1.20.7.3. Pro: It is harder to call people out for their hateful ideas, when they do not express them in plain language.
1.20.8. Con: Criminalising any action has the same effect. No matter what laws you create, people would try to circumvent them, we still need those laws and they are still have a major effect.
1.21. Con: Hate speech is [performative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_utterance) and has, or attempts to have, [illocutionary force](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/speech-acts/).
1.21.1. Pro: Hate speech seeks to define an us-them relationship in which the out-group \("they"\) are excluded from moral consideration and therefore legitimate targets for violence and to make hatred of the out-group part of the core identity of the in-group.
1.22. Pro: The people of a nation should be free to hear ideas that the government doesn't want them to hear.
1.22.1. Pro: Banning speech is a form of tyranny that can induce violent insurrection.
1.22.1.1. Con: Allowing or promoting attacks on specific groups could also be considered tyranny and lead to violence and insurrection. The prevention of civil upheaval is more complex and requires more participation than just banning speech.
1.22.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.12.6.4.4.2.1.
1.22.2. Con: If hate speech is legally protected, and the government has drafted this legislation, it would in this case suggest that hate speech is not, in fact, something government "doesn't want people to hear" by definition.
1.22.2.1. Con: Just because something is legal does not mean that every person in government in charge of drafting/passing/enforcing the law that makes it legal agrees with the law, or wants that law to be exercised in every case. Protection of all speech means that those members of government that take umbrage with your words don't have the power to decide on what you can and can't say. Limiting speech, any speech, means they do.
1.22.3. Pro: The very speech government hates most should be most protected.
1.22.4. Pro: Radical ideas can lead to an increase in logical solutions to complex problems. People should not be censored just because their ideas make someone uncomfortable.
1.23. Con: -> See 1.15.3.
