Discussion Title: Edible Landscapes: Should Lawns Be Replaced?

1. Lawns should be replaced by edible landscapes
1.1. Con: Not everyone has a green thumb.
1.1.1. Con: This has no effect on people's edible landscapes. Most people are required by local jurisdiction to maintain a lawn, and hire people if they cannot maintain one themselves.
1.1.1.1. Con: Maintaining an edible landscape requires much more time and/or money investment than maintaining a lawn. Not everyone will like this trade-off.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: While mowing some 20m2 lawn may be accomplished in several minutes and be done every week or so, weeding a garden of the same area requires several hours of work in bent, kneeling or squatting position.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Lawns may be planted with [drought-resistant grass](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/special/xeriscape/drought-tolerant-lawn-grass.htm), so watering them is effortless and may even be neglected, while nutrient-productive edible landscapes require constant and much more aimed watering.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Edible gardens could require little water and be neglected too, especially when native plants and edible weeds are there.
1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: In an area that gets lots of rain, an edible landscape would not have watering issues.
1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Even drought-resistant lawns like ones with bermuda grass require lots of water \(over [18,500 gallons per year](http://ucanr.edu/sites/UrbanHort/files/249120.pdf) for 1k sq ft\). in comparison to carrots and turnips \(takes [26 total gallons](http://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Mekonnen-Hoekstra-2011-WaterFootprintCrops.pdf) to grow one pound\). To match the equivalent water use of bermuda grass, one would need to grow 719 pounds of carrots/turnips in one year. That is why even with the most drought-resistant grass, growing food still is the best choice for water consumption.
1.1.1.1.2.4. Con: As there are ways to cut corners on watering lawns, the same goes for gardening. Hydroponics and aeroponics could significantly reduce the water use of any garden.
1.1.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Some hydroponic systems use [10% less](https://www.energyinwater.eu/hydroponic-systems-a-way-to-save-water/)water than traditional growing systems.
1.1.1.1.2.5. Pro: Lawns could be artificial turf, which requires no water, while gardens always require water \(i.e. plants need to be alive to create food\).
1.1.1.1.2.5.1. Con: A lawn of edible weeds use no water and the most effort it involves is removing the inedible weeds to make way for the edible ones. This process makes artificial turf require more water, due to its [production](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/10/28/241419373/how-much-water-actually-goes-into-making-a-bottle-of-water), [transportation](https://www.watercalculator.org/water-use/the-hidden-water-in-everyday-products/), and [retail](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261732838X) stages.
1.1.1.1.2.6. Pro: If people choose water-intensive foods to grow \(such as [coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and nutmeg](http://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Mekonnen-Hoekstra-2011-WaterFootprintCrops.pdf)\) they could use much more water than grass on their land plot.
1.1.2. Pro: Edible landscapes require an even bigger green thumb than regular lawns.
1.1.3. Pro: With lawns, people could just add in AstroTurf to not worry about poor maintenance performance. However, there is no plastic version of an edible landscape. Real plants have to exist on the land in order to get the food.
1.1.4. Pro: A choice between edible gardens and low-maintenance xeriscape style gardens would have better results than obligatory edible gardens.
1.1.5. Con: There are more options with edible plants, so those without a green thumb for lawns would find some plant that could thrive in an edible lawn.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Succulents \(like aloe\) are easier to take care of then lawns.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Many crops become self-maintaining, especially trees, once they reach a certain age and amount of care.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: People could pick plants that require the least amount of maintenance for their area.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: This could be achieved by asking \(like neighbors or the government\) for which plants require the least amount of care.
1.2. Pro: Regular lawns are boring.
1.2.1. Pro: Normal lawns lack visual interest and variety.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Normal lawns are most commonly made of grass and little else.
1.2.2. Con: An edible lawn may be too aesthetically chaotic for some.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Some people may enjoy the uniformity of a lawn.
1.2.3. Con: In most areas of the Earth, there are extensive unproductive seasons. Lawns appear the same during these periods \(except when covered with snow\), while edible landscapes look just as bare or weed-overgrown earth. Not everyone finds this kind of view much more entertaining than a boring lawn.
1.2.3.1. Con: Edible lawns could be made with evergreen plants like [rosemary](https://www.todayshomeowner.com/annual-and-perennial-herbs-for-your-garden/) instead of annual plants like [basil](https://www.todayshomeowner.com/annual-and-perennial-herbs-for-your-garden/) to make sure the landscape stays visually aesthetic year-round. This beats regular lawns, as they do not last through the winter.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: There exist annual types of lawn grasses.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: In moderate climates, evergreens either do not survive, or are to be covered for the winter: both ruins the aesthetic value.
1.2.3.2. Con: Some food crops outlive most plants around them \(such as [olives](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/photos/the-worlds-10-oldest-living-trees/olive-tree-of-vouves)\), including grass. This would be the preferred choice over lawns.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Trees, including fruit and olives, are commonly allowed to be planted on the lawns. This requires no further legislation or enforcement.
1.2.4. Con: There is a variety of landscaping that can be done to make a lawn more appealing.
1.2.5. Con: Boring is subjective to the individual. What is considered boring to one, can be seen differently to another.
1.2.6. Con: Lawns provide spaces for children to play on. They can't play on plant beds, and may as a result get bored. Thus, lawns may be less boring for some categories of people.
1.2.7. Pro: Edible lawns will add variety to [boring](http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/sns-realestate-disappearing-lawns-story.html) lawns: visually and educationally.
1.3. Con: Regular lawns keep a visual uniformity.
1.3.1. Pro: Regular lawns raise the value of homes \(within a neighborhood\).
1.3.1.1. Pro: A [manicured lawn](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/lawn-care-industry/lawns-appearance-affect-property-value/) is pleasing to the eye and may increase the aesthetic value of a home for sell.
1.3.2. Pro: This sets a calm and orderly tone within neighborhoods.
1.3.3. Con: Just like the same model of house can be visually uninteresting, uniform landscaping can create the same visual tone.
1.4. Con: Edible landscapes may be hazardous.
1.4.1. Pro: Some plants that food grows on may have thorns.
1.4.1.1. Con: Roses have thorns, but are not seen as hazardous. The same is possibly true for edible gardens.
1.4.2. Con: Regular lawns are hazardous as well \(see [lawn mower injuries](https://www.webmd.com/children/news/20110603/lawn-mower-injuries-are-on-the-rise#1)\).
1.5. Pro: Edible landscapes can increase privacy in capabilities that lawns cannot provide.
1.5.1. Pro: Edible plants are taller than grass \(like shrubs and weeds\).
1.5.2. Con: The viewing area might be worse when looking outside from inside the house.
1.6. Pro: Edible lawns are better for the environment
1.6.1. Pro: Edible lawns can be poly-cultural \(which increases biodiversity\) with tons of different species, such as clover, edible weeds, and more.
1.6.1.1. Pro: [Monoculture farming](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/monoculture.htm) is an issue that edible lawns avoid. Produce grown for grocery stores have tight restrictions and require a steady supply \(the reason for the monoculturing focus\) that edible lawns have more leeway with \(especially in backyards\).
1.6.1.2. Pro: These plants tend to be more native to the land and would be better for the ecosystem in this regard.
1.6.1.3. Pro: These plants require less maintenance, as they grow on their own.
1.6.1.4. Pro: These plants require less water, as they tend to grow without assistance. This is much better than lawns, which require lots of water to maintain\).
1.6.1.5. Pro: These lawns would be less stressful to take care of, as they require little maintenance keep with consistency of it.
1.6.1.5.1. Pro: Lawns require constant plucking of weeds, whereas weeds can grow however way they want to with edible landscapes.
1.6.1.6. Con: Some weeds are not visually aesthetically pleasing.
1.6.1.7. Con: Some weeds require maintenance to keep the edible ones in and the inedible ones out \(unless the ones that people think are not edible really are\)
1.6.1.8. Con: Some weeds are a hazard to others and should not exist in yards \(especially if they have spikes or are poisonous/have poisonous parts without preparation\).
1.6.2. Pro: Food waste is less likely to occur.
1.6.2.1. Pro: People would want to preserve what they grow, because of their efforts going into creating it.
1.6.3. Pro: Foods are fresher on an edible lawn, which decreases throwing away spoiled food.
1.6.4. Pro: Lawns require poisonous and synthetic chemicals to be maintained.
1.6.4.1. Pro: These toxins leach out of lawns, polluting nearby planters and the ground water.
1.6.5. Pro: The water used for grass could be used for food, which decreases the water usage of growing foods in the food system.
1.6.6. Pro: A properly mulched food forest can use 1/2 the water of a typical lawn.
1.7. Pro: Edible lawns are healthier for people
1.7.1. Pro: Edible landscapes with large trees and shrubs will help to cool off neighborhoods during heat waves in the summer better than the regular grass coverage of lawns.
1.7.2. Pro: Edible lawns could solve part of the hunger problem in America.
1.7.2.1. Con: Those who have a yard/land tend not to be the ones who are hungry.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Edible lawns could feed those without a home when they walk by the front yard.
1.7.3. Pro: Edible landscaping gives psychological/mental benefits.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Edible lawns would be a great learning experience to help people become more connected to and conscientious of how food is grown and made, along with their needs/role in its production.
1.7.3.1.1. Pro: If people can place as much effort to growing food as they do to lawns \(since it would replace it\), then people would have no excuse as to why they don't have a "green thumb" when it comes to gardening.
1.7.3.2. Pro: The physical exercise from maintaining an edible landscape has mental benefits.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Maintaining edible landscapes are a mental exercise, stimulating the mind to counteract progressive mental diseases when people get older, such as Alzheimer's and dementia.
1.7.3.4. Pro: Being outdoors more allows people to absorb Vitamin D, which improves people's emotional state and mental mood.
1.7.3.5. Pro: The hard work gives people a sense of accomplishment from growing one's own food.
1.7.3.6. Pro: Seeing the food production from start to finish can clear a person's conscience of fears from how their food is made.
1.7.3.6.1. Pro: People can feel like they are more ethical if they grow their own food instead of ask for it.
1.7.3.6.2. Pro: People can worry less about animals that are harmed in the production of their food, because people would take extra precautions in avoiding harm from occurring.
1.7.3.6.3. Pro: People will not have to worry about pesticides, herbicides, or other chemicals in their food if they have control over growing it.
1.7.3.7. Pro: Edible landscaping decreases stress.
1.7.3.7.1. Pro: The lack of worry about being able to pay for food can alleviate stress.
1.7.3.7.2. Pro: Engaging physically and kinesthetically with an edible garden through maintenance brings people closer to nature. This alone can create stress relief.
1.8. Con: One should not be forced to convert their lawn into a small garden if one doesn't wish to. The choice is to remain free.
1.8.1. Con: Many people are forced to maintain a lawn when they don't want to \(which is not 'remaining free'\). Being forced to maintain an edible lawn is no different \(as the laws will pressure property owners to conform and create uniformity regardless of whether it's a lawn, edible garden, or other\).
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.9. Con: Edible landscapes are more likely to be attacked by insects and other plant plagues.
1.9.1. Con: Edible landscapes are usually more diverse in plant species and therefor more resistent to plagues.
1.10. Pro: Edible landscapes are more resilient than lawns.
1.10.1. Pro: Since there are more types of plants that grow food than those on lawns \(which are just grass\), there are more options to keep an edible landscape going \(when one plants fails, it could be replaced with a different one\).
1.10.2. Pro: Lawns tend to have problems like yellow patches, [winter kill](https://www.thespruce.com/winter-kill-on-lawns-2152908), or [other](https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/factsheets/diagnosing-problems). If set up correctly, edible landscapes would not face issues that lawns create \(for example, some crops [make it through winter](https://www.familyfoodgarden.com/crops-that-can-handle-frosts-snow/)\)
1.11. Pro: Edible landscapes help maintain world peace.
1.11.1. Pro: During World War II the British government starting an initiative called “[Dig for Victory](https://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A2263529)”, where public green spaces as well as people’s front lawns were used to cultivate crops. Even the Royal parks in London were used. The main reason for this was to supplement supply’s that were limited due to production being reduced by the need to provide an armed force. This carried on well into the 1950’s as rationing carried on after the war. This initiative was embraced by the public.
1.11.1.1. Pro: The British self-reliance from "Dig for Victory" [helped them win in WWII](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/9996180/How-Dig-for-Victory-campaign-helped-win-the-War.html). Thus, edible landscapes increase the resiliency of nations to keep unsound governmental practices of other countries in check instead of them taking over the world.
1.11.2. Pro: Growing food could help [prevent water scarcity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jkxdh-Y8-8), which is one source of [political conflict](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2016/09/02/water-scarcity-cooperation-or-conflict-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/).
1.12. Pro: Edible landscapes create economic benefits.
1.12.1. Pro: Edible lawns could generate an income for those who grow more than they can eat.
1.12.2. Pro: Edible landscapes cost less to grow and maintain than lawns.
1.12.2.1. Con: The cost of an edible landscape will vary by size, quantity of food planted, and supplies necessary.
1.12.2.2. Pro: With a lawn, money goes to both the lawn and the food. With an edible landscape, money is going to just the food \(if at all, as some plants maintain themselves\).
1.12.2.2.1. Pro: Money saved from growing food pays for the landscape itself and is much cheaper overall.
1.12.2.3. Con: People could make an edible landscape more complicated than their previous lawn if they switch, which would incur more costs than ever before.
1.12.2.4. Pro: Edible landscapes might have big upfront costs \(such as a greenhouse for winter crops\), but will save a person money in the long run.
1.12.2.4.1. Pro: If possible, the government could subsidize the transition to edible landscapes if the change becomes a reality.
1.12.2.5. Pro: Lawns require tedious labor just to make it look nice while food forests can have extravagance and varying degrees of complexity and beauty with less maintenance.
1.12.3. Con: Edible lawns can cause lots of people to lose their jobs due to so many people working in the agriculture sector.
1.12.3.1. Con: Those who lose agriculture jobs could take up consulting jobs for people's lawns.
1.13. Con: Edible lawns could keep "keeping up with the Joneses" going, just in a different context.
1.13.1. Pro: People picking from other people's lawns would cause greater effort for owners to upkeep their yard.
1.13.1.1. Pro: This is essential as people could change the aesthetics of the yard to make it less visually pleasing \(as the foods provide vibrancy and color\)
1.13.2. Pro: Lawns are a form of social conditioning that we perpetuate without really thinking about it.
1.13.3. Pro: Examples involve who could grow more food for people and how pretty does each lawn looks.
1.14. Pro: Edible landscapes can simultaneously spawn newer and more positive industries while also decreasing negative ones.
1.14.1. Con: Edible landscaping will decrease produce transport jobs, which will negatively impact employment.
1.14.1.1. Con: These jobs are getting automated anyway, so they might find a new job in the new industries
1.14.2. Pro: Foods from edible landscapes are better than from the grocery store \(and thus reduce this industry\).
1.14.2.1. Pro: Edible lawns could help people cope with disasters, such as food shortages.
1.14.2.1.1. Pro: If there is a food shortage, which affects grocery stores, at least there is still food on the lawn to compensate.
1.14.2.2. Pro: Edible lawns would make food more convenient than ever before.
1.14.2.2.1. Pro: Edible lawns could create community with sharing and collaborating \(such as people growing different foods to share\).
1.14.2.3. Con: Grocery stores provide more variety than what one lawn can provide.
1.14.2.3.1. Pro: The land space is smaller on a lawn than the sources that grocery store foods grow on.
1.14.2.3.2. Pro: The [growing zones](https://growhops.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/hardinesszones-compressed1.jpg) might not allow people to grow all the foods available at a grocery store.
1.14.2.4. Pro: People can reduce food waste by eating parts of plants that never make it to the grocery store \(due to not passing USDA grades\).
1.14.2.5. Con: Nothing prevents grocery stores from selling great variety of tasty [quality foods](https://www.google.de/search?rlz=1C1EJFA_enDE795DE795&ei=9ZpsW8a_HazI6ATR-ZmwBw&q=meyer%20zu%20bentrup%20gem%C3%BCse&oq=meyer+zu+bentrup+gem%C3%BC&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.33i160k1l2.4599.9534.0.11635.11.10.1.0.0.0.176.1346.0j10.10.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.9.1224...38j0i19k1j0i22i30k1j33i21k1j33i22i29i30k1.0.6FIO9NtKOW4&npsic=0&rflfq=1&rlha=0&rllag=52014225,8466582,1038&tbm=lcl&rldimm=15726017275235716583&ved=2ahUKEwilociN3-DcAhVIDZoKHWsrDSIQvS4wAXoECAEQMQ&rldoc=1&tbs=lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!2m1!1e16!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:10#lrd=0x47ba22dc83dbc365:0xda3e09644e14cde7,1,,,&rlfi=hd:;si:15726017275235716583;mv:!1m3!1d31412.12654382166!2d8.50867070051504!3d52.012870347324!3m2!1i571!2i614!4f13.1) produced at scale.
1.14.2.6. Pro: Food from one's own garden has less contact with the public and therefore less chance of harboring bacteria and viruses passed from human to human.
1.14.2.6.1. Pro: Farmers, pickers, and grocery clerks also touch the product too, which creates more contamination points.
1.14.2.6.1.1. Con: Automation could eliminate these contamination sources.
1.14.2.6.2. Pro: When people do not grow their own food, they have difficulties knowing which food is contaminated or not. If they eat unwashed food that was fine, they might feel the next one is too \(but is not\). This uncertainty would lead a person to get ill.
1.14.2.6.3. Pro: These pathogens are difficult to clean off, as the cleaning process is not always efficient or sufficient.
1.14.2.6.3.1. Pro: Some foods are too delicate to clean, like ripe raspberries.
1.14.2.6.3.2. Pro: Sometimes cleaning the food would push the pathogens further into the food and into spaces that cannot be reached \(especially since produce is porous and water helps with diffusion\).
1.14.2.6.3.3. Pro: As someone is touching the food \(using hands or utensils\) to clean it, they transport the pathogens around through contact. Unless a basin is used to clean the produce, cleaning food through touch is inefficient.
1.14.2.6.4. Con: Since the plants are outdoors, they could be contaminated easily from anything there \(like from air pollutants to animals\).
1.14.2.7. Pro: The edible lawn's food is healthier, fresher, has less food miles, and no packaging.
1.14.2.7.1. Pro: The food also has [more nutrients](http://www.aerogardenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/White-Paper.pdf) due to ripening on the plant.
1.14.2.8. Pro: Edible lawns would make people more connected with their food.
1.14.2.8.1. Pro: People will likely be less wasteful of food if they have to grow it themselves.
1.14.2.8.2. Con: There is just as much a chance that people will neglect their gardens as much as they do their lawns currently, which is a display of disconnection.
1.14.2.8.3. Pro: Edible landscapes might cause people to question their diets and possibly become vegan \(due to the difficulties of raising and processing meat\).
1.14.2.8.4. Pro: Growing food teaches something that is not taught much in schools.
1.14.2.8.4.1. Pro: Skills learned from growing food could be passed onto children.
1.14.2.8.4.1.1. Pro: This could help strengthen families, as they can spend more time together through this process.
1.14.2.8.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.1.
1.14.3. Pro: People would walk less to places to eat \(such as restaurants and grocery stores\) if they consume their lawns.
1.14.3.1. Con: Most people do not eat out the grab a salad, but rather specialty foods. Edible gardens will not decrease eating out.
1.14.3.2. Con: People enjoy eating out for social purposes. Edible gardening does not fulfill this purpose.
1.14.4. Con: Without the industries \(that get lost with edible landscaping\), people will not know where to get a job and thus lose their purpose of taking care of their community \(by producing a steady income\).
1.14.4.1. Con: Edible landscape jobs will most likely will be better \(more ethical, healthier, and progressive/futuristic\).
1.14.4.2. Con: Newer industries will replace the jobs that are lost.
1.14.5. Pro: The business of edible landscaping could decrease the amount of plastics and packaging used for processed foods since most will be growing their own produce.
1.14.6. Pro: Edible landscaping would decrease gas needed and carbons emitted in order to transport produce from farm to market.
1.14.7. Pro: Industries for greener DIY farming could be made available as a result of more people growing their own produce, as its likely they will want less toxic methods to grow.
1.15. Con: Lawns are good for children and dogs to play on.
1.15.1. Pro: Play activities can still occur on landscapes that have climate/geographically correct flora or alternative materials. Using local, acclimatized landscapes gives the same benefit of play area for much less resource cost. Likewise, mulch, recycled turf or other surface for a heavy play area. [gardeningknowhow.com](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/lawn-care/lawn-substitutes/lagen/high-traffic-lawn-options.htm)
1.15.2. Con: There are designated public parks available for children and dogs to play on.
1.16. Con: Edible lawns could create judicial and enforcement concerns.
1.16.1. Pro: Edible landscapes could spark an increase in trespassing and petty theft to steal produce.
1.16.1.1. Pro: Replacing lawns could spark additional laws and edits of current ones to make conditions for picking off private property without stealing.
1.16.1.1.1. Pro: Private property laws might change to allow people to enter people's front yards to pick food for themselves.
1.16.1.1.1.1. Pro: Privacy issues could emerge from this.
1.16.1.1.1.2. Con: Just like farms are private property and the public cannot legally trespass and pick produce, they same is likely true for one's home.
1.16.1.1.1.3. Con: Currently, it is [illegal](https://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2014/09/is-it-legal-to-pick-fruit-right-off-the-tree.html) to trespass and pick food off of trees and from gardens of private property. It is unlikely that private property paid for by the home owner will be made public to allow others to eat their food.
1.16.1.2. Pro: People could steal other food from other people's yard and then sell it, which should be against the law.
1.16.1.2.1. Con: Con of "laws": laws would be barely enforceable without evidence and people would need to have cameras on their yards to prove negligence.
1.16.2. Pro: Edible lawns may be harder to manage and enforce because each lawn would be created differently than the rest.
1.16.2.1. Pro: This would lead to a lack of collaboration, as people cannot help each other due to a lack of knowledge \(compared to lawns where everyone knows how to take care of the same thing and can learn from each other in this regard\).
