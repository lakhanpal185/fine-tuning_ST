Discussion Title: Does God Allow Evil: Is the Existence of God Compatible with the Existence of Evil?

1. Because of the existence of evil, there cannot be a monotheistic God \(as traditionally conceived\).
1.1. Con: Good and evil are not mutually exclusive. God may have a greater purpose for allowing evil to exist.
1.1.1. Pro: God knows evil exists, God is able to eradicate evil, but it would be self destructive as a god to eradicate evil even if he is all loving. The reason he exists is to help you deal with evil, if you are already living a carefree life and there was no one trying to take it away you don't need his help or his salvation.
1.1.1.1. Con: It is inconceivable that an all loving god would allow a hell to exist. That a being of his own creation could be doomed to suffer for all eternity is not the action of an all loving and all powerful god.
1.1.1.2. Pro: There are sufficient grounds for believing that the Bible contains divine revelation.
1.1.1.3. Con: There aren't sufficient grounds for believing that the Bible contains divine revelation.
1.1.1.4. Con: God is defined as a maximally great being, which means he possesses aseity \(self-sufficiency\). This means that he is his own point of existing. If he relied on some other purpose for existing, then he would lack aseity and therefore not be God \(as traditionally conceived\).
1.1.1.5. Con: According to the Bible God has no point or reason. God simply is. That's one of the most important characteristics of the Judeo-Christian God.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: The Judeo-Christian God possesses the property of aseity, or self-sufficiency. In other words, the purpose of God's existence is intrinsic to himself. He is his own purpose, and from him the concept of "purpose" derives.
1.1.1.6. Con: If god allows evil to foster dependence on him he is abusive, not loving.
1.1.1.7. Pro: God desires relationship with his people and creations. This is stated many times throughout the Bible. People would not seek this relationship without their need for his salvation and support.
1.1.1.8. Pro: God exists as an antithesis to evil. Drawing close to Him necessarily draws you away from evil. His presence is a respite from the evil of the world and would not be necessary without the existence of that evil.
1.1.1.9. Pro: The existence of some evils, such as pain, lead to second-order goods, such as sympathy. This would mean that the prevalence of evil is, in fact, necessary for the whole of goodness to be possible.
1.1.1.9.1. Pro: Given that evolution is the likely species moulding vehicle in use in this universe, pain \(functionaly speaking\) is necessary for substancial homestatic advantage of individuals, thus a next likely evolutionary step is a species which can make good use of it's social groups emotings \(pain for the sake of this argument\) to better attune to or expand their species' niche..
1.1.1.9.2. Con: Sympathy is not necessarily a good thing. It can have positive manifestations but can also cause a lot of distress to the recipient depending on the circumstances. Moreover, someone who is tortured to death and feels great pain, gains nothing from those that sympathise afterwards.
1.1.1.9.2.1. Con: There are many virtues that require evil in order to exist. The necessity of opposition in morality is not simply limited to one virtue.
1.1.1.9.2.2. Con: If there is no sympathy, there can be no love. No love from a parent who knows what their child is going through, having experienced it. No love from a teacher with a struggling student. Sympathy is more valuable than it is not.
1.1.2. Pro: Our creator's objective may be to sort those who are prone to good behavior from those who are prone to evil behavior.
1.1.2.1. Pro: If we master the ability to create artificially intelligent agents who might one day serve us in perpetuity, we might do the same.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: We would not be a perfect creator if our software had bugs.
1.1.2.2. Con: If God is all-knowing, God would have no reason to test humans because he already knows the outcome.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: God may intentionally limit his knowledge about certain outcomes in order to provide human beings with the ability to exercise free will. \(see [open theism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_theism#Comparison_of_open_and_Reformed_theism)\)
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: If god limits his knowledge he is by definition not all knowing.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: We may expand the definition of all-knowing to something like, "capable of knowing all things that he wishes to know."
1.1.2.2.2. Con: God is not testing humans to figure out the outcome, but to give them opportunity to manifest and build their character.
1.1.2.3. Con: It would not make sense for God to have an objective or a task. If He has a task then he's serving a greater good, bigger than himself. Saying that He has a cause is making him almost human and thus disproving him to be the supreme being described to us in the scriptures. There is no point in praying to a lesser God, if He exists at all.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: God may have the objective to remain perfect.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: The concept of God is a perfect being. If remaining so is an objective then that implies a effort to be perfect. If an effort is required then he ain't perfect.
1.1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The language of "objective" may be used analogically, to help us understand God's actions from a human vantage point \(similar to using figurative speech to describe quantum mechanics\). It may not equate to "objective" in the usual, mundane sense of the term.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.1.2.4. Con: That does not explain evil coming from natural disasters, meaning: evil that has nothing to do with human behavior.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: God may have other uses for natural disasters, such as [developing character](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1960.512). However, because we lack an omniscient perspective, we are unable to determine what all these reasons might be.
1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: New born victim babies never had a chance to develop a character.
1.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Developing character may only be one of many reasons that God permits evil and suffering. Also, it is possible that God provides alternate means for innocent child victims to develop characters. \(such as in an alternate world\).
1.1.2.5. Con: If god created everything, he should already know who is prone to good or evil behavior, as he created them with those predilections.
1.1.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.1.2.6. Con: That is called The Holy Inquisition. They used to test witches, by binding them and throwing into river, to sort out those who are prone to floating.
1.1.2.6.1. Con: Inquisitions and witch hunts failed because those who engaged in such actions lacked a perfect perspective \(e.g. perfectly omniscient, just, and rational\). God \(as traditionally conceived\) would have these traits, and so the same failures would not arise.
1.1.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.6.1.
1.1.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.1.2.9. Pro: God is sorting the good from the bad in His duel against Satan. In the last judgment, the good will be rewarded for their pains, and the evil will be condemned. [See Parable of the Wheat and Tares.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A24-30&version=NKJV)
1.1.2.9.1. Con: If God does not already know which people are good and which people are bad without needing to test them empirically, then He is not omniscient.
1.1.2.9.1.1. Con: It might be the case that people can only become good or bad once they are tested; so even if God can perfectly predict everyone's response to the tests, the tests may still be necessary in order to actually instantiate the properties of goodness or badness in people.
1.1.2.9.1.1.1. Con: Goodness and badness, by most reasonable measures, can be influenced by environment. If the purpose of the "tests" is to make people good or bad, then a benevolent God would be able to choose "tests" to maximize the number of people who are good. It is unlikely that the number of good people is maximal.
1.1.2.9.1.2. Con: The existence of genuine free will might prevent God from predicting the outcomes of certain tests, without hindering God's omniscience.
1.1.2.9.1.2.1. Con: Many "tests" involve the "subjects" interacting with or being affected by another person. In order for such a test to occur, God must either A\) precisely predict the actions of that person, B\) violate the person's free will \(that is, control their actions\), or C\) accept that the test might not occur as planned. A contradicts the above, while B and C present further problems for the general understanding of God.
1.1.2.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: Anselm of Canterbury defines God as "that than which nothing greater can be thought". A being which accomplishes the same feats as God but can predict every person's actions is greater than a being which sometimes violates free will or makes mistakes.
1.1.2.9.1.2.1.2. Pro: With regard to B, If God violates a person's free will in order to make them commit a violent act, then the assailant is blameless for the act and is not evil. If anyone is to be considered evil, they must have committed an act for reasons which had nothing to do with God choosing to test people. People who believe that God tests people generally also believe that perpetrators of violent acts are evil.
1.1.2.9.1.2.1.3. Pro: It is often said that "God makes no mistakes".
1.1.2.9.2. Con: If God is in a struggle with anything it is not omnipotent.
1.1.2.9.3. Con: God created Satan. God is not all good.
1.1.3. Con: "God has greater purposes" is actually an argument against his omnipotence \(he cannot do better\) or his benevolence \(there was a way to avoid evil but he did not choose it, because avoiding evil is not his main purpose\).
1.1.3.1. Con: The existence of evil may be a logically necessary part of God's ultimate purpose, and even an omnipotent being cannot override the rules of logic. For example, God's ultimate purpose could be that humans exhibit bravery or mercy, and the existence of actual evil is logically necessary in order to elicit those virtues.
1.1.3.2. Con: Omnipotence means that God can do anything \(any "thing"\). However, not every described action is coherent, and thus not really a thing. For example, God cannot create a two-sided triangle, because such a described action is incoherent. Likewise, it may be incoherent for free will to exist without the possibility of evil. Thus an omnipotent God may be unable to conceive of a world with free will and without evil due to its incoherence.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: God need not necessarily be bound by the laws of logic.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Logically contradictory things are not possible. Even an omnipotent God cannot create impossible things.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Then he is not all powerful. An all powerful god would necessarily have the power to change laws of logic and math and physics in order to create the impossible.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: If God can break the laws of logic, then he can also break the law of non-contradiction, making any argument against his existence futile. \(for example: even if you showed that evil's existence contradicts the existence of an all-loving, omnipotent God, it wouldn't matter, since God can break the law of non-contradiction\)
1.1.3.2.1.2. Con: To argue logically about the existence of God \(whether pro or con\) presumes that God is bound by logic. If God is not bound by logic, then there is no utility in using logical arguments to prove or disprove his existence.
1.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: If god cannot alter logic then he is bound by it and is not all powerful.
1.1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.2.2. Pro: God \(as traditionally conceived\) is unlimited in doing anything he desires to do. However, God only desires to do things that accord with his nature. God's nature is utterly perfect, which entails that God is utterly rational. As such, God cannot commit an incoherent action, since such an action would be irrational, and thus go against his nature and desire. This is only a "rule" insofar as it tells us how God will or will not act. It does not bind him in the sense that it inhibits his desires.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: To limit or bind a person means to inhibit their ability to fulfill desires. The laws of logic do not inhibit God's desires, because logic is intrinsic to his nature. Thus, all of God's desires accord with the laws of logic, and do not keep him from doing anything he desires to do. As such, God may remain fully omnipotent while also adhering to the laws of logic.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Then god does not wish to remove evil and suffering from the world, and is not all good.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.2.3. Con: A benevolent God would not create a world \(or free will\) if that forces him to create evil. If creating a world \(or free will\) entails necessarily causing evil then there should be no world \(or free will\).
1.1.3.2.4. Con: Free will can exist without evil. You can choose among multiple good choices without having to cause harm.
1.1.3.2.4.1. Con: While free will can exist without evil, significant character-building choices cannot. It is greater for such choices to exist than not to exist, due to the incommensurate good of developing one's character through a journey of difficult choices, which logically entail the existence of hardships \(which in turn entail evils\).
1.1.3.2.4.1.1. Con: Developing your character is not an incommensurate good. On the contraty it is bad \(an evil in itself\) compared to having a perfect character to start with.
1.1.3.2.4.1.1.1. Con: There may be multiple kinds of perfect characters, with some being greater than others. A perfect character which has developed its virtues through a journey of difficult choices may entail a greater kind of perfect character than one that was simply made perfect to start with. One can see an analogy of this in mathematics, for example, in the fact that there are different sizes of infinity, with some infinite sets being greater in size than others.
1.1.3.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Suppose all As are greater than Bs. This entails that even an imperfect A is greater than a perfect B, and a perfect A is even greater than a perfect B. If we define A as "persons who develop their characters" and B as "persons who do not develop their characters", it follows that all persons who develop their characters are greater than those who do not develop their characters, even if the latter are perfect specimens.
1.1.3.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If we define A as "persons who do not develop their characters" and B as "persons who develop their characters", it follows that all persons who develop their characters are worse than those who do not develop their characters, even if the former are perfect specimens.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2. Con: It is possible to have significant character-building choices without evil. In fact some of the most character-building choices to be made are between two choices with equally positive outcomes. For example choosing a career between two good choices, or choosing a partner.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1. Con: Intrinsic to what makes these choices meaningful are the potential risks and sacrifices entailed in various options. If you eliminated these factors, the choices would cease to be meaningful. For example, some jobs might involve hard work \(which involves pain\), or some romantic partners may be more attractive but not connect with us on an emotional level \(which involves sacrifice of one kind or the other\). Likewise, intrinsic to the allure of romance is the risk of heartbreak \(a pain\).
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Sacrifice does not require evil. Sacrificing a future with one partner for a future with another is an example of a significant choice that does not require evil.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Sacrifice entails a pain of some form. A "painless sacrifice" is an oxymoron.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Sacrifice simply means to give up something of importance or value for the sake of other considerations. Pain is not a necessary part of sacrifice.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2. Con: If god couldn’t create meaningful choices without the presence of evil he is either not very imaginative, not very powerful, not very good, or all of the above.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2.1. Con: This is easily resolved by adopting a common definition of omnipotence which defines "all things" as "all logically coherent propositions". Under such a definition, certain suggested "acts" of God would not be "things" if they entail incoherent propositions. Such an understanding of omnipotence has been the norm for theists in all major monotheistic traditions. The act you are wanting God to commit may entail incoherent propositions, and thus not constitute a "thing".
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: A "thing" can be symbolized as T. An omnipotent God can accomplish all Ts. Something is a T if and only if it is a logically coherent proposition. Thus, an incoherent proposition entails -T. Omnipotence does not mean that God can accomplish -T, but merely all T.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: God created all things. Including logic. He could have created a reality in which evil is not necessary.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: If by "thing" we mean a "logically coherent proposition", then God could not have created logic, since creating logic entails incoherent propositions. The normal theistic position is that logic is intrinsic to God's nature, not that he created it.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: If logic is intrinsic to god’s nature, and god is all good, then it would not be logically incoherent to create a world without evil
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Accomplishing a maximally feasible good may logically require the use of evil, since negating the variable E \(evil\) from a maximally feasible good may entail incoherent propositions.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Then god is not all good
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: If logic is simply a reflection of god’s nature, and it is not possible to create a world without evil, then god must necessarily have evil in his nature, and cannot by definition be all good.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Even if it is possible to create a world without evil \(W1\), it may be the case that a greater world \(W2\) logically requires the presence of evil. A perfectly good being would want to create the greatest world he was logically capable of creating. Since W2 is greater than W1, a perfectly good being would prefer W2 over W1, even if W2 necessarily contains evil, and W1 does not.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Assume all As are greater than Bs. Also assume that Bs can logically exist without evil, but As logically require the existence of evil. If such a state of affairs is the case, and if a perfectly good God always wants to create the greatest world he can logically create, then such a God would prefer A over B, despite A containing evil and B not containing evil.
1.1.3.2.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Why would we assume any of those things?
1.1.3.2.4.2. Con: If the will is only permitted to choose pre-approved conclusions, it remains unfree. Since God's good purpose is fulfilled no matter what in this scenario, a selection of only good choices is only an illusion of freedom. Since man would thus be forced to obey God, this constitutes coercion, which is evil. To have free will without coercion, humans must be able to choose not to obey God's will. If God's will is purely for good, then this must at least allow for human beings to choose to do evil.
1.1.3.2.4.2.1. Con: God already confines humans to the laws of physics. This is not coercion. God would simply have to change the laws of physics to make harming others physically impossible, while allowing humans to choose with free will among the entire range of actions that do not harm others. Violating God's will \(and thus evil\) would be physically impossible.
1.1.3.3. Pro: Omnipotence is poorly defined because it could mean anything or the entity being could limited to the type of universe we happen to inhabit. For example, if we approach the world from a scientific model \(old earth model\) perhaps the difficulty of homeostatic maintenance is what is necesary to produce human like intellect over time through evolution, and some god figure made it so, making natural evils \(things that kill us\) necessary.
1.1.3.4. Con: The existence of evil actually increases God's power \(in that He can make good out of evil shows more power than Him making good out of something neutral\) as the existence of His greater purposes increase His goodness \(in that He teaches goodness vs evil to us so that we can appreciate and enjoy goodness instead of thinking it neutral\).
1.1.4. Con: Religious ethics is typically [deontological](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/), and views the infliction of harm on present victims in order to serve a future greater good as immoral. There is no reason to believe that God is exempt from this basic moral position.
1.1.4.1. Con: There is no reason to privilege actual, existing systems of religious ethics. It may be that God is a [consequentialist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/), or adheres to some other system of ethics which permits the infliction of this sort of instrumental harm.
1.1.4.2. Con: As the supreme moral authority, God is not obligated to anything, morally.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: God is also benevolent, which means that God adheres perfectly to the rules of morality.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: God is perfect, and it is greater to be moral than immoral. Therefore God is perfectly moral. Thus, all of his actions are perfectly moral. This means that everything he wills is moral. He would never commit an immoral action, because such an action would go against his perfectly moral will.
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: God is good by God's definition. Human moral judgment of God is irrelevant. Might makes right.
1.1.4.3. Con: If the infliction of harm preserves Creation *itself*, then it is not only moral, it is necessary.
1.1.4.4. Con: This isn't necessarily the case. For example, an ethical person may take take a child to the dentist \(temporal suffering\) in order to achieve the greater good of the child having a healthy mouth. Similar points can be made about discipline, hard work, and learning from mistakes. God may use temporal suffering in a similar manner, though at a greater magnitude because issues of eternity are at stake.
1.1.4.5. Pro: If all the major religions are deontological in their moral construction, and God behaves in a consequentialist way \(e.g. "greater good" arguments\), yet God is supposed to be our moral guide, then either all the major religions are wrong in their construction of morality, God is not benevolent, or God does not exist.
1.1.4.5.1. Con: If only one being knows the greater good for all situations, then that being is entitled to Consequentialism, and all other beings are subject to deontology. Thus, there is a marriage between the two viewpoints. A prime example is how God the Father \(according to the New Testament\) commands his son Jesus to obey him and suffer for mankind. Jesus is the prime example of deontology, our moral guide, while the being who speaks from the sky down to the prophets is obviously the consequentialist.
1.1.4.6. Con: This is logically flawed. The idea that a current suffering may produce a future good, is a much more well established deonotoligical principle.
1.1.5. Pro: The best possible world may still logically require the existence of evil and suffering.
1.1.5.1. Con: It's not that free-will requires the possibility of evil, it's just that it creates the possibility of mistakes.   In the context of Satan's existence and trickery, this may create evil \(whether we intend to or not\).
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Without important decisions to choose between, a person does not have free-will in any serious sense. Important decisions require the possibility of evil or suffering. For example, in the story of Adam and Eve, the tree was necessary so that humans would have the possibility of making a decision that would cause serious suffering. Whether one takes this story literally or not, it illustrates the principle that free-will \(in any real sense\) requires big stakes.
1.1.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.1.5.2. Pro: The serpent is part of God.  He can't get rid of it.  We made the mistake of listening to him and disobeying.  The higher purpose is that we have to grow up and finish the Journey of Knowledge.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.2.3. Con: If evil is a part of god then he is not all good. If he can’t get rid of it then he is not all powerful.
1.1.5.2.3.1. Con: There is no good reason to think that an all-powerful, all-good God couldn't have sufficient reasons for allowing evil/suffering. Such a determination would require an omniscient perspective, which we lack.
1.1.5.2.3.1.1. Con: This is an appeal to ignorance.
1.1.5.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Appeals to ignorance are valid to show possibility. They are only fallacious when used to prove a matter with certainty \(which isn't being attempted here\).
1.1.5.2.3.1.2. Con: There is no good reason to think that an all-powerful all-good god would allow evil or have a reason to need it.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1. Con: It is reasonable to assume something is possible absent grounds showing it isn't possible. Such grounds haven't been shown.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1. Con: It is not reasonable to posit that an all powerful all good deity needs or wants evil to exist.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: If he needs evil to exist he is not all powerful. If he wants evil to exist he is not all good.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no good reason to think that an all-powerful, all-good God couldn't have sufficient reasons for passively permitting evil. It would require an omniscient perspective to make this determination, which we lack.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Reasons or not, if god is all powerful, he can achieve the same results without permitting evil, therefore he is not all good.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no good reason to think that an all-good, all-powerful God couldn't have sufficient reasons for preferring a world with evil in it to one that doesn't. Determining this would require an omniscient perspective, which we lack.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If god prefers a world with evil in it then he is not all good.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no good reason for assuming that this is necessarily the case. Determining this would require an omniscient perspective, which we lack.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It does not make sense to assume an all good all powerful being would prefer evil. This is pure nonsense.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: All that is being assumed is that it is possible. No good reasons have been provided to show why it couldn't be possible. Asserting that something is nonsense doesn't make it so.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. One cannot simply assert absent evidence that an all good god would prefer a world with evil.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: All that is being claimed is possibility. This is not an extraordinary claim. I am not positing a level of likelihood.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is wildly counterintuitive and requires more support than a simple assertion.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Possibility alone does not carry this burden.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is a nonsensical assertion that contradicts the definitions of the words being used. Explanation is required.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Asserting that something is nonsensical doesn't make it so. No definitive contradictions have been shown.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The words "all" "good" and "powerful" preclude the possibility of a deity encompassing all of the above while still preferring the existence of evil. It is not possible for a god to be all good and desire or allow suffering to exist.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: No grounds have been given to prove that this preclusion is necessarily the case. Such a determination would require an omniscient perspective, which we lack.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The definitions of the words being used prove that it is necessarily the case.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: No grounds have been given to prove that the definition of words necessarily lead to this result.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The definitions do not preclude the possibility if such a being has sufficient reasons for allowing evil to exist. Since we lack an omniscient perspective, we have no way of determining whether this is the case.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If god needs evil to exist, he is not all powerful. If he wants evil to exist he is not all good.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This is begging the question, since you are using the assertion to prove the matter asserted.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: No sufficient reason can possibly exist given god's all powerful, all good nature.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Making this determination requires an omniscient perspective, which we lack.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: If God is all-powerful, then he would be powerful enough to reconcile existent evil with his all-loving nature \(assuming it is logically possible  for an all-powerful being to have such power\).
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: An all-powerful God would be powerful enough to overcome any objection to the compatibility of evil's existence with his all-loving nature.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: This begs the question. If god's logic justifies equivocation, then good and evil are meaningless concepts, and yet, every god does delineate them sharply, by identifying specific thoughts and behaviors and expects us to do the same.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.2. Con: If god wants evil to exist then he is not all good.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: If God is all-powerful, then he would be powerful enough to remain all-good while also willing evil's existence. 

Note: if by omnipotence we mean a being who can do any logically possible thing, but not break the laws of logic, see [this link](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1+1960.160-1960.2392+1960.2642+1960.2647) for clarification on this argument. However, if by omnipotence we mean a being who can also break the laws of logic, see [this link](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1+1960.160-1960.2392+1960.2642+1960.2646) instead.

1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: This is simply a repeat of your previous claim. Used as an argument it is question-begging.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.2.1.2. Con: Then all meaningful definitions of god are useless and it is better to assume he does not exist.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.3. Con: If it is inconsistent, it is a proof he didn’t make it consistent. So we come back to the question of if it is consistent or not.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.3.1. Con: Assuming it is plausible that an all-powerful being exists, it is reasonable to believe that this being would be powerful enough to be all-loving and also permit evil, even if the consistency of these two things is not readily apparent. In other words, we can infer the possibility of their consistency, even if we do not know how or why they are consistent.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: An analogy would be the wave-particle duality of photons. We may not immediately understand how it is possible that something can be both a wave and a particle at the same time, but sufficient data can lead us to conclude that their co-existence is plausible.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.3.1.2. Con: The possibility of consistency for unknown reason doesn’t invalidate my argument :
If we prove these things are inconsistent, it prove the all-powerful being didn’t make them consistent, so the proof of this inconsistence can’t be invalided by the fact a all-powerful being could have made it consistent.
The fact that we can proove it or not, is unrevelant for this argument.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.3.1.2.1. Con: God's omnipotence functions as an epistemological barrier, making it impossible to establish an indubitable proof that an all-loving God cannot be reconciled with the existence of evil.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4. Pro: No proof has been shown to to indicate that an all-powerful being would lack sufficient power to reconcile existant evil with his all-loving nature. Thus, it should be presumed possible since omnipotence entails power vastly exceeding human capacity and cognition.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.1. Pro: If omnipotence entails the power to break the rules of logic, then such a being could break any logical obstacle between evil's existence and his all-loving nature.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: A God who could break the laws of logic would not be bound by the law of non-contradiction, and so could be two things at once even if these two things logically contradicted one another. Thus, even if it could be shown that an all-loving God could not logically permit the existence of evil, God could simply break this logical contradiction and make it possible anyway \(via his meta-rational omnipotence\).
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2. Pro: If omnipotence entails the power to do anything that is logically possible but not to break the laws of logic \(e.g. maximal power\), then such a being may have sufficient logical reasons for permitting evil and suffering \(e.g. to create the greatest logically-feasible world\).
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1. Pro: 1. An omnibenevolent God would want to create the greatest world in his power to create.

2. The greatest world a maximally powerful being would have the power to create would be the "greatest logically-feasible world."

3. The "greatest logically-feasible world" may by necessity contain evil and suffering.

4. Therefore, an omnibenevolent, maximally powerful being may coherently create a world containing evil and suffering.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: 1. It is greater to create beings with agency than without  agency.
2. Agency entails the possibility of choosing evil. 
3. Therefore, it is greater to a create a world with beings who can choose evil than one in which they cannot.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Both premises are unsupported and unproven.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Both premises have inductive plausibility, through comparisons between beings that lack agency \(such as rocks and potatoes\) and those that do \(such as humans\). To put it another way, it seems reasonable to infer from experience that humans are greater than rocks and potatoes.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is not proven that humans are greater than rocks and potatoes.

1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2. Con: Agency does not necessarily entail the possibility of choosing evil.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.1. Con: It is possible that agency necessarily entail this possibility.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: It is equally or more possible that it doesn't, and your premise cannot therefore be assumed.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: More than possibility is required for premises to an argument. If I posit that 1- unicorns exist, 2- if unicorns exist then god doesn’t exist, therefore 3- god does not exist, then we cannot conclude god exists based on the mere possibility of my premises.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The pro-theism burden of proof in this discussion is merely to show possibility, not to show that a state of affairs is necessarily true, or to posit a percentage likelihood of its truth. There are other arguments for the existence of God \(such as the cosmological and teleological arguments\) that can raise the probability of his existence, and therefore of the compatability of evil with his existence.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: As this is all speculation nothing can ever be shown to be impossible. The expectation is to provide plausibility.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Because we lack an omniscient perspective, it is impossible to gauge plausibility on this topic.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Grandparent argument makes two positive claims that must be proven in order to support the conclusion drawn by them. More than possibility is thus required.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Same as the argument with unicorns. It is possible unicorns exist and it is possible that the existence of unicorns disprove the existence of god. It is not reasonable to therefore conclude god does not exist.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.

1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Empirical data suggests that it is greater to do so, especially if agency entails consciousness. It seems plausible to infer that it is greater to create conscious beings than a universe filled with nothing but dead matter or mindless animals.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: That animals, presumably via evolution, have unconsciously automated the overwhelming majority of their bodily functions evidences that not all agency is beneficial \(presuming that agency is more than merely a post hoc conscious '[veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Libet#Implications_of_Libet's_experiments)' of non-conscious operations\). For example, if we had to consciously control our heartbeats and digestion, we would most surely be overwhelmed and perish sooner than later.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.4.1.2. Con: It may not be better to introduce conscious beings if that entails introducing evil that hasn't yet existed. If god was maximally good before the creation of other conscious beings, then introducing conscious beings that require temporary evil to re-balance that maximal goodness shows both that god was not maximally good before other conscious beings were created \(since god needed to improve the prior state by creating conscious beings\) and that the existence of evil is better than its absence.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: If god co-emerged from the very beginning with conscious beings that require some amount of evil to maximize the good, then there may have been no other maximally good prior state to compete with and improve upon.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: If God co-emerged, either he was not God, or there are many gods.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: A world with only maximal goodness \(God\) in it is, in the least, temporarily better than a world with some evil in it.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.4.2. Con: Only beings with agency can choose to love.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.2. Con: An omnipotent being creates not only the variables, but the framework. The omnipotent being defines what is logically feasible by creating and defining both logic and feasibility. \(Eg. quantum states do not operate under our own definition of logic or feasibility\).
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.2.1. Con: The majority of theists do not believe that God creates logic. They believe logic is intrinsic to his nature. The normative understanding of omnipotence is that God can do all things that accord with his character \(which is perfectly logical\), or that accord with his will \(which is also perfectly logical\). It is a misunderstanding of classical theism to claim that omnipotence entails an absurdist God.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.2.1.1. Con: If logic is intrinsic to god's nature then evil would not be logically required to exist.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.2.1.2. Con: If God cannot create or define logic, \(as an example\), then logic is external to the power of God. Therefore God could not be considered to be omnipotent. The majority of theists \(that I am aware of\) assert that God cannot be defined. Defining God as inherently logical would be an error.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.2. Con: This is a flawed definition of maximal power. If god created the universe, he necessarily also created the laws within it, and therefore could have made logic in such a way that evil was not necessary.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.3. Con: Even if god finds only temporary utility in evil, it still shows that either evil has some positive valence for god \(assuming god has free will to choose to maximize the good, so the motivation to use evil is a more desirable choice in order to accomplish that goal\) or that god is not powerful enough to avoid using evil. In either case, the introduction of evil \(by choice or by necessity\) leaves a god who is either not omni-benevolent \(evil via choice\) or not omnipotent \(evil via necessity\).
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5. Con: The caveat that 'all-powerful' is contingent upon 'logical possibility' negates the definition of 'all-powerful.'
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1. Con: The term "all-powerful" does not imply that a being can satisfy conditions that logically cannot be satisfied.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: If a being can satisfy conditions that cannot be satisfied, then that being also cannot do so. This renders the concept meaningless and irrelevant. The concept of being able to take absolutely any well-defined action without restriction is not meaningless or irrelevant.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.1.1. Con: If god were powerful enough to create both logical and illogical propositions that obtain, it would necessarily be incoherent in a system requiring logic to obtain, such as this very system.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.1.2. Con: That a being can satisfy conditions that cannot be satisfied may be neither meaningless nor irrelevant \(to the being or to other beings\). It would be both meaningful and relevant that a being could be so powerful that it was not constrained by logic.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: A person who hears about a being so powerful that he can satisfy conditions that cannot be satisfied could have emotional, intellectual, and/or behavioral reactions that are meaningful experiences to that person. Even absurdity can invoke meaningful states of hope, awe, confusion, or wonder that motivate action.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.1.3. Con: Even absurdity has meaning in the world, in terms of utility, so it is not irrelevant.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.2. Con: A proposition that power as necessarily a subset of logic begs the question via a presumption that non-logical and/or arbitrary phenomena cannot exist. Non-logical and arbitrary phenomena do appear to exist or at least have the possibility of existing \(which is not to confuse epistemology with ontology\).
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.2.1. Con: All statements about anything presume that logic is correct, and that therefore illogical phenomena cannot exist.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.3. Con: If god is reduced to the limits of logic and necessity, it lacks free will, and so cannot even "allow" evil in order to make sense of the topic question.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.3.1. Con: The topic question is whether or not God's decisions are consistent with His opposition to evil. This is a meaningful and theologically relevant question, regardless of whether God's decision-making algorithm can be said to constitute "free will" or not.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.3.1.1. Con: If the topic question implies "free will" \(i.e. the ability to defy necessity\) in the word "allow," there may be a consequence of what "evil" means, including whether it applies to god itself in its "decisions."
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.3.2. Con: The term "free will" was defined in order to describe humans, whether in reality or possibility. We have always known that humans can't do things that are impossible, so that cannot be a prerequisite for any definition of free will.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.3.2.1. Con: This claim does not refute the parent claim by explaining how god has the freedom to defy necessity in order to "allow" free will, nor does it explain how or why god's freedom is different than human freedom. It merely implies that the wording of the discussion topic is inappropriate and/or misleading when applied to god.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.4. Con: Since the very premise of this discussion starts with a fictional concept of a being that no one can ever totally explain \(incomprehensible in terms of ‘how’ and not merely ‘what,’ so that it qualifies as something more than merely an advanced, but limited, being\), the proposition that limitations we perceive in this world must also apply to god are speculative, at best.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.1.5. Con: The proposition that limitations we perceive in this world must also apply to god are speculative, at best, since an eternal and omnipresent being may have existed before and/or beyond the laws of logic.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.5.2. Pro: A god, by definition, engages incoherent states and actions or its use is an equivocation with an advanced limited being \(at best, a 'demi-god'\). If it can't defy the laws of logic, it's not omnipotent, but merely powerful. If it doesn’t know how to defy the laws of logic, it's not omniscient, but merely intelligent. If it can’t go to a place beyond the laws of logic, it's not omnipresent, but merely mobile. If it must use evil as a means to good, it's not omnibenevolent, but mostly good.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.6. Con: If God's all-loving nature and His enabling of evil are logically contradictory, and He convinces himself that they are not, then He has made Himself wrong. A person who is wrong about something is not omniscient.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: They do not preclude such a possibility if the being under discussion has sufficient reasons for permitting evil. Since we lack an omniscient perspective, it is impossible for us to know whether this is the case.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: an all powerful god would need no reason to permit evil. An all good god would have no desire.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.1.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: This is begging the question, for it uses the matter asserted to prove its truth.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: It makes sense if such a being has a sufficient reason for doing so. Because we lack an omniscient perspective, we are incapable of knowing whether or not such reasons exist.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: If he enjoys suffering he is not all good.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Enjoyment of suffering has not been posited.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The grandparent claim has been linked in so many different locations it is impossible to respond to this. It wasn't posited in all the different threads, but has been posited in some.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: This is an argument from ignorance, so neither pro nor con.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The words "all" and "good" are a great reason to think that an all good all powerful god couldn't have sufficient reasons for preferring a world with evil in it to one that doesn't. There is no good reason for assuming otherwise.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: All that is being posited is possibility. It is reasonable to posit possibility absent reasons showing it isn't possible.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: It is not possible for an all good deity to enjoy or desire suffering.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: This argument begs the question, as it assumes the truth of the matter being debated.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Even merely using evil temporarily as a means for some eventual good gives it utility. If evil has utility in bringing about the good, it has positive valence to god. If both good and evil have positive valence to god, then we cannot distinguish their valence in any meaningful way. But this is absurd, because even god distinguishes them and expects us to do so as well, so it is an equivocation. No omniscient perspective is required to observe this.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: If he permits evil he is not all good. Because of how words work.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This is begging the question, since this argument is the matter under dispute.
1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.5.3. Con: This argument places limits on God, which would violate his omnipotence.
1.1.5.3.1. Con: Omnipotence means that God can do anything \(any "thing"\). However, not all described actions are coherent, and therefore not really "things". For example, God cannot make a two-sided triangle, because such a described action is incoherent. Likewise, for God to achieve the greatest feasible good without using suffering may entail incoherent propositions. If so, then such a limitation would not contradict his omnipotence as traditionally understood.
1.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: God must follow the laws of logic, which may require that evil and suffering exist in the best feasible world. Correctly understood, God's need to follow the laws of logic does not contradict his omnipotence.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: The laws of logic do not contradict God's omnipotence because they do not impede his will. Rather, God's will is always logical because God \(as traditionally conceived\) is defined as a perfect being. A perfect being is perfectly logical, because it is better to be logical than illogical. Since his nature is perfectly logical, he will always make logical decisions \(thus following the laws of logic\). As such, God's will is never impeded by the laws of logic, and so he is able to remain omnipotent.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This is circular logic and a bit of word salad. Either god is restricted by logic or he is all powerful. Both cannot be true.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no circular logic. To be restricted means to have one's will bound \(i.e. to be forced to do something you don't want to do\). God's will is never bound by logic because his desires are always logical \(due to his intrinsically logical nature\). In other words, God never wants to do something illogical because doing so is not in his nature. So his desires are never impeded by logic.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In that case god doesn’t wish to end suffering or evil and therefore he cannot be all good.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: An all-good God would not wish to end suffering or evil if a greater good were only logically achievable with the existence of evil and suffering.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: For example, evil/suffering may be logically necessary to develop [virtues](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1+1960.160-1960.1103+1960.1581+1960.1587) or to enable [free will](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.1113+1960.1375).
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: More good would exist in the absence of evil and suffering. By definition.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The definition of good does not necessarily entail this. Good is [defined](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=b9d1WqvTDpKK5wLqzLqYDA&q=good+definition&oq=good+definition&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.366.2046.0.2243.16.9.0.3.3.0.333.1208.0j4j1j1.6.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..7.9.1222.0..0i131k1j0i20i264k1.0.G9FaHeFyz6Q) as "that which is morally right", or "beneficial or advantageous". Neither of these definitions entail an absence of evil and suffering. In fact, some of them may require evil and suffering. For example, it may be moral/right to punish someone for doing wrong, which requires suffering on their part. It may also be advantageous/beneficial to give people free-will, which enables the possibility of suffering.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The greatest good possible would only exist in the absence of evil, because evil and suffering necessarily diminish happiness and joy, which is not advantageous.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: There may be logically necessary processes \(including evil and suffering\) necessary to bring free agents to a blissful state. For example, God may need to use evils and suffering to allow free agents to make morally-significant decisions and develop virtues. These things may be logically necessary in order to develop characters sufficiently to exist in a sustainable paradise, which could not logically exist or be sustained without humans with these developed characters.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: God created logic, and therefore could and \(were he all good\) would have made it logically possible to have virtue growth absent suffering.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: God \(as traditionally conceived\) did not create logic. He is defined as a perfect being, which entails that he is perfectly logical. Logic is intrinsic to his nature. It is a part of God, not a created entity.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: God made the universe and all the rules that contain it, including logic. There could easily exist a universe in which logic is different from our own.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If by "God" we mean a perfect being \(which is God as traditionally conceived, and therefore the being under debate in this topic--see the heading\), then we mean a being that is perfectly logical \(since it is greater to be logical than illogical\).  Thus, God \(as traditionally conceived\) would not make worlds that violate his nature \(which is perfectly logical\). If you wish to define God differently that is fine, but it is not the being under discussion in this topic.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Saying god can do everything except the things he can't do is simply a clever way of saying he is not all powerful.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no good reason to believe that this is the case. Nearly all words have multiple definitions/implications depending on usage. There is no good reason to think that divine properties are any different.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no nuance in the definition of the judeochristian god as all powerful. It is clearly and definitively described. Searching for nuance is at best a weak argument.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Insufficient grounds have been given to prove that the concept lacks nuance.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: If there is something god can’t do then he is not all powerful. Admitting god can’t do certain things is a clear concession that he is not all powerful
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Insufficient grounds have been given to prove that this is the case. Many truths have counterintuitive entailments. This may be one of them.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: If god can't circumvent counterintuitive entailments then he is not all powerful. Because of the word "all" and the word "powerful"
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: In a divine sense, "Cannot" and "Will not" are synonymous. When we say God "cannot" do something, we simply mean he "will not" do it because of other things we know about his nature. God never experiences obstructions to his will.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Then there are no logical entailments preventing the creation of a world without evil.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Logical entailments may include things about such a world that an all-good, all-powerful God would not desire due to other aspects of his nature.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If god does not desire to remove evil then he is not all good
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The universe consists of physical objects, which have liabilities and powers which we codify as "laws of nature." God creating the universe, however, does not entail that he also created abstractions \(such as math or logic\), which may simply be a part of his nature.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Math and logic are human constructs used to understand the universe and our interactions with it. They cannot exist absent the universe.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Math and logic are too predictable and effective to be mere human constructs. It is more plausible that we discovered and codified math and logic, but that the principles underlying our codifications actually exist.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.

1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: One can develop virtues absent suffering.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Some virtues may logically require the use of suffering. We lack the omniscient perspective to know whether this is the case. By experience, however, it seems obvious that many virtues require suffering/danger/evils. For example, courage requires a danger to be courageous about. Compassion requires a subject who is suffering and therefore in need of compassion. Etc.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Only because god created it that way.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: What God creates accords with his nature, which is perfectly logical \(assuming we are speaking of God as traditionally conceived\).
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: We lack the omnipresent perspective to know whether what God creates accords with His nature.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: True, but we can accept it as a possibility unless falsified. So long as it is possible, the burden of proof is met for this discussion.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: God's nature being logical is exactly what is challenged by the problem of theodicy and this discussion. Claim basically decides the outcome of discussion and use that as an argument within a discussion.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If we want to propose that God transcends human logic, this would actually assist in theodicy, since it would mean that God can overcome any logical objections to his actions. The problem of evil would immediately be resolved, since God would not need to operate according to logic. He could be perfectly good and also allow evil, and it wouldn't matter if these two things were logically contradictory, since God transcends logic.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.3. Con: Courage is not a necessary virtue.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: We lack the omniscient perspective to know whether or not this is the case.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: We do not lack the logic, though. A valid counterargument would claim that courage is necessary a virtue.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: We need omniscience to know the full entailments of logical propositions. Even the simplest proposition can have infinite entailments, analogous to the digits in pi.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.4. Con: We lack the omnipresent perspective to know whether our obvious experience is absolutely accurate.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: That's true, but the burden of proof in this discussion does not require absolute accuracy. It only requires possibility--e.g. showing that it is possible for God and evil to co-exist.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.5. Con: Compassion and courage are not necessary absolute virtues, they may exist only due to imperfection of the world created by God. Courage may be required for a public performance, not exclusively for facing a danger.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.5.1. Con: In the example above, we would still need courage to overcome the stage-fright \(or whatever\) involved in a public performance. Fright is a species of suffering, and so in this example suffering is still necessary for the virtue of courage.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.6. Con: There were situations when people argued that courage and compassion are not virtues, but weaknesses.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.6.1. Con: There were also situations when people believed that the earth was flat. Yet we were still able to arrive at superior conclusions through reason and evidence. Similarly, the fact that some people have warped views of virtues does not mean that we cannot use reason and experience to arrive at a clearer understanding.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.7. Con: When you say that we lack the omnipresent perspective, that addresses both pro and con. "Some virtues may/may not require the use of suffering". What is the use of these arguments? This is a platform which uses pro and con arguments, while you insist on 'maybes'.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.7.1. Con: The pro-theism burden of proof in this discussion is merely to show that it is "possible" for God and evil's co-existence to be justified. As long as it is possible, evil's existence is not necessarily incompatible with God's existence. As such, demonstrating that something "might" or "could" be the case is sufficient to show that classical theism and the existence of evil are logically compatible propositions.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: By definition, God's nature is intrinsically logical \(since he is defined as a perfect being, and it is greater to be logical than illogical\). Therefore, God's desires \(by definition\) accord with his nature and so will always be logical.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This is begging the question. You cannot prove god is logical by asserting that god is logical. This must be proven.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The proof: 
1\) God is defined as a perfect, maximally great being.
2\) It is greater to be logical than illogical.
3\) Therefore, God is perfectly logical, by definition.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This is still begging the question. The debate is centered on whether or not god is in fact logical and good, so asserting that he is does not prove it so.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Claiming that a valid argument begs the question doesn't make it so. You aren't showing how the argument begs the question. The conclusion follows logically from the premises, making it a valid argument.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The premises are not proven. The debate is whether god is good. Arguing god is good because god is logical and god is logical because god is good is not a sound argument.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The debate is not over whether God is good. It is whether the concept of God \(as traditionally conceived\) is consistent with the existence of evil. Thus, the premises do not need to be proven. It just needs to be shown that the concept of God is consistent with the existence of evil. I am just explaining the definition of God and its entailments. \(e.g. that God, by definition, is perfectly logical\).
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.

1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Our minds' structural principles \( like logic\) do not manifest any influence over God' nature.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Logic is not about God or reality. It is modus operandi of the human mind, it is about rules we follow when we consider reality. Our mind allows paradoxes, but does not allow absurd, God must not be absurd. So, God may or may not be all-powerful; our context of either God must not be absurd. From our perspective, concept of God is restricted by logic, God should not be absurd, and all-powerful God is not an absurd concept. Only a traditional context of all-powerful God is absurd.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Apparent absurdities \(e.g. paradoxes\) often arise from failing to think outside the box. The traditional conception of God is still logically possible once we allow ourselves loosen the semantic range of our use of language. This is analogous to realizing that it is possible for something \(such as photons\) to exist as both a wave and a particle, even though traditional uses of language bar an object from simultaneously possessing both properties.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: To argue logically about the existence of God presumes that God's nature correlates with logic.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3. Con: If God cannot create a world without suffering then he either is not all good or not all powerful. The existence of evil proves God is not perfect.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2. Con: This argument depends on the definitions of "all-good" and "all-powerful" used. According to classical conceptions of God, his onnibenevolence and omnipotence can be so defined/understood as to be consistent with one another.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Agrippa's Trilemma only exists if God's superlative attributes \(such as omnipotence\) are defined colloquially or imprecisely. Under standard philosophical definitions, the trilemma does not exist.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: These concepts have been defined. Redefining them to fit an argument is disingenuous.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: They have a sufficiently broad semantic range to be defined in a variety of ways.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Only if one fails to understand the words “all” “powerful” “good” and/or “present.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Words like "all", "powerful", "good", and "present" have different meanings and implications depending on use/context.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: "Omnipotence" "omnipresence" and "omnibenevolence" do not have different meaning or implications. They are commonly understood terms that can and should not be changed simply to fit an argument.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The standard philosophical definition of omnipotence is [maximal power](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/omnipotence/), which entails the power to do all logically possible things. Under this definition, a being could conceivably be both omnipotent and omnibenevolent while still permitting evil/suffering.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Therefore, an omnipotent, omnibenevolent being could conceivably co-exist with evil.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: It is possible that evil's existence can be sufficiently justified.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: An omnibenevolent being would desire to achieve the greatest good possible, so long as necessary evils entailed by it could be sufficiently justified.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Certain evils may be logically necessary to achieve a logically maximal good.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: Maximal power is the greatest power that a being could conceivably possess. It is impossible to conceive of power that breaks the laws of logic. Therefore, a being with maximal power must follow the laws of logic.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: If a description is illogical, it is merely a word salad and does not express semantic content. An irrational being can be described with words, but not conceived. As such, the description is a meaningless word salad, analogous to purple envy or eating democracy for breakfast. It has no semantic meaning.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.2. Con: It is quite easy to conceive of powers that break the laws of logic. It is done all the time in all forms of fiction.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: An omnipotent God would have the ability to see all possible outcomes of all events. The god could therefore allow a particular evil because on balance it led to a greater good.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: We may use words like "all-knowing,"  "all-powerful", "all-loving", etc. as shorthand for more nuanced concepts. This is consistent with the the Judeo-Christian tradition, for example, which frequently uses shorthand language/imagery to point to more nuanced theological concepts, which may take time, maturity, and scholarship to work through in detail. Thus, this would be consistent with a "traditional concept" of God, since it has been practiced regularly in traditional monotheistic faiths.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: This is simply admitting god is not all powerful, all knowing, or all loving.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.

1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.2. Con: One must limit gods power, benevolence, or both in order to present a god consistent with the existence of evil.
1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.

1.1.5.3.1.1.2. Con: If God is required to follow laws, then he is not all powerful.
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.2. Con: 'Laws of logic' are not about power, but perfection. Meaning, 'breaking' the laws of logic is imperfect, we call it absurd.
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.3. Con: The rules are simply a manifestation of God's character \(e.g. the character of being perfectly logical and having other perfect attributes\).
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.3.1. Con: If the rules are a manifestation of God's character, then they should not prevent the creation of a world free from evil or suffering as an all powerful and all good god would necessarily wish to create.
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: If god is all powerful and all good then suffering would not exist.
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: An all-loving, all-powerful God would allow evil and suffering if a greater good were only logically achievable with the existence of evil and suffering.
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.3.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.3.1.2.1.2. Con: If god cannot create the greatest possible good without evil and suffering then he is not all powerful.
1.1.5.3.1.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.

1.1.5.3.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.2. Con: If God must follow the laws of logic, then he is limited and therefore not omnipotent.
1.1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.3. Con: It isn’t a logical impossibility to imagine a world with no suffering or evil.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1. Con: The concept may involve incoherent entailments, which we aren't privy to \(since we lack an omniscient perspective\).
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.1. Con: God made the rules. Were he all powerful he could change said rules so there were no incoherent entailments limiting him.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.2.3.
1.1.5.3.1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.2.3.
1.1.5.3.1.4. Con: Grandparent argument does not place such limitation on God; it mentions the best possible world, which is less than perfect. If God cannot create the best of all possible worlds as more perfect, then He is not omnipotent.
1.1.5.3.1.4.1. Con: There may be no such thing as a single best possible world, but rather multiple equal-best worlds. God may be able to choose between multiple options. The world we live in may be one instantiation of an equal-best world.
1.1.5.3.1.4.2. Con: The grandparent argument implicitly places this limitation on God, because it defines God as "traditionally conceived." Traditional theism posits a perfect being, and a perfect being is by entailment perfectly logical \(since it is greater to be logical than illogical\).
1.1.5.3.1.4.2.1. Con: If god cannot alter logic to suit his needs then he is not all powerful.
1.1.5.3.1.4.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.2.

1.1.5.3.1.4.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.5. Con: God himself revealed to us a world without evil - it's called heaven. Therefore it's not an impossibility.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1. Con: In the philosophical sense, "[world](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/possible-worlds/)" means "all that is". It does not refer to a specific planet \(e.g. earth\) or a specific plane of existence \(e.g. heaven\). Thus, evil may still be necessary in a "world" that includes heaven, even if the heavenly portion of that world does not contain evil.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1. Con: Heaven was created before the earth and people, before evil existed. Therefore it is possible for heaven to exist without evil.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1. Con: The topic under discussion is not the Judeo-Christian God in particular, but rather the general concept of God \(or theism\) as traditionally conceived. This would mean a perfect or maximally great being, and does not necessarily entail the God revealed in the Judeo-Christian tradition.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Though most monotheistic religions consider god as all powerful and all encompassing so evil would have to originate with Him.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There are multiple species of origination. One such species is passive allowance. Under this species of origination, God would have passively allowed evil, but not actively created it. If so, God would only need the property of "being capable of passively allowing evil", and evil itself would not need to be understood as an intrinsic property of God.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Then god would not be omnipitent as traditionally understood in the parent claim. Evil must exist either because of God or in spite of God.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Most monotheistic religions consider God as all powerful, meaning he has power over good and evil and everything in between.
1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.6. Con: It's not clear that there are incoherent things. For example it used to be assumed that the sum of the angles in every triangle is 180 degrees. However that changed once we started exploring other possible surfaces. By the same token it could be possible to make a two sided triangle with one side hiding in another dimension.
1.1.5.3.1.6.1. Con: Such a triangle still has three sides, even if one side is in a different dimension. It still wouldn't be two-sided in the ultimate sense.
1.1.5.3.1.6.1.1. Con: This was just an example by me, a being with limited capacities. God does not have those limitations.
1.1.5.3.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Not under the [standard philosophical definition](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/omnipotence/) of omnipotence, which is maximal power. Maximal power is the greatest power a being could conceivably possess. It is impossible to conceive of a being who breaks logic, because conceivability entails logical coherence. Therefore, a maximally powerful being must still follow logic.
1.1.5.3.1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: It is not impossible to conceive of a being who breaks logic
1.1.5.3.1.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.5.1.
1.1.5.3.1.6.1.2. Con: It would be up to the definition whether such a triangle be accepted as two sided or three sided. God could make us accept any definition he wishes. He could make us even accept multiple definitions at once.
1.1.5.3.1.6.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.6.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.1.7. Con: Triangles have 3 sides by definition that's why it might be impossible to create a two sided one.
However; evil is not a part of the definition of the world.
1.1.5.3.1.7.1. Con: It could still be a logical entailment of the world. Not all logical entailments are obvious.
1.1.5.3.1.7.1.1. Con: Evil could be a logical entitlement of the world - many things are possible. There is no good evidence for it however.
1.1.5.3.1.7.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.2.1.
1.1.5.3.1.7.1.1.2. Con: There are [other reasons](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/does-god-exist/) to believe that God \(a maximally great being\) exists, raising the probability that such logical entailments exist.
1.1.5.3.1.7.1.2. Con: It's equally possible that evil is not a logical entitlement of the world.
Actually it's more possible that it isn't since we have the existence of heaven as an example.
1.1.5.3.1.7.1.2.1. Con: We lack the omniscient perspective to gauge probilities concerning this issue.
1.1.5.3.1.7.1.2.1.1. Con: This doesn’t address the parent argument. The existence of heaven is proof that it is possible to create an all good world without evil.
1.1.5.3.1.7.1.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.5.1.
1.1.5.3.1.8. Con: Quantum physics often circumvents the laws of our logic to achieve action. It's implausible to believe that God would be more limited.
1.1.5.3.1.8.1. Con: Quantum mechanics circumvents a mundane use of language. It does not circumvent logic. Once words are given a broader semantic range as applied to particles, quantum mechanics still follows logical rules. The apparent contradictions that arise are simply contradictions due to mundane word use.
1.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.1.5.5. Con: If evil is necessary, it is expected from the claim to explain the logic behind the idea.
1.1.5.5.1. Con: A comprehensive explanation may not be possible, since we lack an omniscient perspective. Nonetheless, certain partial explanations can be given, such as God desiring to develop our [characters and virtues](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1960.512), or to give us [free will](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.38).
1.1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Moral goodness is only possible if there is free-will. But free will is only meaningful if it entails the possibility of choosing evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: The premise of the debate suggests that a supremely benevolent God is simultaneously a dictator, which are contradictory notions.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.1. Con: A human dictator is intrinsically evil because it involves a limited human being taking on a role only suitable for a divine, perfect being. Any being less than divine would be playing God, and therefore engaging in evil. However, a perfect being is suited for such a role, precisely because such a being is supremely benevolent and just.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: It is plausible that a benevolent God would bestow his creation with choice, rather than force worship and servitude. Therefore, it is plausible that a perfect God could allow wrong choices that produce evil \(or that which is contrary to himself\).
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The god of the bible threatens eternal damnation to all who do not worship him. A choice made under duress is not a choice made freely.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: God is not coercing people by creating Hell, since it's not clear that absolutely everyone wants to avoid Hell. 

To be in heaven is to be in God's presence. To be out of God's presence is to be in hell. If you do not choose to come to God, He will not force you to be in His presence. He won't use force to compel someone into heaven against their will - for a person can choose, whether to be with God or not be with Him. [youtu.be](https://youtu.be/XjHhtWL_3Og?t=327)
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Isaiah 45:7 \(King James\) "I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things." This text explains that evil can be independent of human choice as God himself creates evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The Bible talks about more than one kind of evil. This particular verse is talking about natural evil or calamity rather than moral evil or [sin](http://www.goodnewsaboutgod.com/studies/spiritual/the_organized_church/evil_sin.htm). If one is considering the entire context, there are good reasons for God to create calamity as well as allow sin to exist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: If God desires disciples, a disciple that freely chooses to follow is better than a disciple that was given no choice.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.2.4. Pro: A loving God would indeed allow evil choices. To prohibit them would be akin to a parent forcing their child to never misbehave, which cannot be an ethical practice. Rather, a child learns and grows by making mistakes.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.3. Con: It does not necessarily follow that a dictatorial god is something other than  a supremely benevolent God. We have imbued dictator and its variants with negative emotional content that don't seem to be required.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.4. Con: Dictators are not always bad. A dictator is just someone with total control
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.5. Con: The contradiction identified in this claim is contained in the bible itself. Evidently, the texts that describe God's character contradict themselves. A god cannot simultaneously be supremely benevolent and flood the world, or send plagues or command the genocide of rival tribes.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.5.1. Con: The limitation of a human viewpoint does not allow the perspective to be able to see whether the net result of these actions was more positive or negative. A surgeon causes pain and suffering to parts of the body for the good of the whole body.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.5.2. Con: The premise of this debate does not assume that we are talking about the God who has revealed Himself in the Bible.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Indeed, as early as  Saint [Ambrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose), the dominant approach of mainstream Christian theology has been to interpret sacred texts in such a way as to equate the Biblical conception of God with the philosophical conception used in this debate.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.5.4. Con: Summarized from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-Richard-Dawkins-description-of-god-incorrect/answer/Andy-Kaminski-1):
The Bible is a collection of books from varying genres - covering the cultural stories of the Jews, their relationship with God, the origins of Christianity, written and compiled over many centuries.

The portrayal of God in these stories is not remotely consistent. His character changes to fit the needs of the individual tale. He is forgiving and vengeful, compassionate and ruthless, peaceful and genocidal, open handed and close fisted, shepherd and slaughterman.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1.6. Con: The premise tells us that god must have created good and evil. He has chosen to create both, and if that is so, then he can’t be benevolent. Stating that he is not a dictator but is a kind of a strawman fallacy
1.1.5.5.1.1.2. Con: If we are made in God's image, then if God is not evil, even our free will should not be able to produce evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.2.1. Con: Any conceivable physical world must be limited, finite. Evil is a consequence of a being's limitations and finite nature. Therefore it is impossible for a deity to create any physical world where evil does not exist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.2.1.1. Con: A finite world need not contain evil. For example, a finite world with only one very happy individual is conceivable, and such a world would not contain evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Distance can be measured only with two points. Evil can be seen as unpleasant act from one individual to another\(s\).
1.1.5.5.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Finite beings cannot by definition be invulnerable or immortal therefore they may suffer injury or death which leads to suffering
1.1.5.5.1.1.2.2. Con: Being made in something's image does not imply having every property identical to the original thing. In fact, it implies a degree of difference. Having chosen evil is apparently one of them.
1.1.5.5.1.1.3. Con: God is perfect and can do anything.  So if God commands the binding of Isaac, no matter what, that is good to obey in faith, despite the result. God then commands Abraham to stop sacrificing his child, and Abraham does \(passing the test\).  Moral action is to choose to act according to God’s \(unchanging\) good nature and plan. The measure is genuine obedience and the consequence of deterministic conformity to God’s  plan is the highest moral good, arising to spiritual, heavenly good.
1.1.5.5.1.1.3.1. Con: According to the Euthyphro dilemma, God cannot be the source of the Good. Something is either good because God commands it, or God commands it because it is good. If it is the first option, then the good is arbitrary; if it is the second option, then there is a standard for the Good outside of God's will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The Good then is only arbitrary according to the perspective of someone other than God.  Socrates thought \(in Protagoras\) 'No one goes willingly toward the bad'" [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia) This represents a limit of the Greek conception of the good, from lack of exposure to the more developed Christian doctrine, as Paul says "For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out."[link](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7:18)

1.1.5.5.1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.5.1.1.3.1.2. Con: The Euthyphro dilemma can be resolved by postulating that good is intrinsic to God's nature. Things are good because they correlate with God's nature, and all of God's laws correlate with his nature.
1.1.5.5.1.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.5.1.1.3.3. Con: The fact that moral actions are those which conform with God's plan does not mean that people's actions are deterministic. It merely means that there is a fixed standard towards which people ought to aspire.
1.1.5.5.1.1.4. Con: Free will is not sufficiently important to justify allowing evil to exist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.4.1. Pro: God supposedly intervened many times to prevent evil from happening against the will of the evil doers \(smites them or performs miracles to thwart them\).
So God chooses to stop evil and deny us free will sometimes and in those times it didn't erase the concept of goodness but emphasized it.
1.1.5.5.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Our freedom is limited in many different ways, such as with gravity and the laws of physics. God's intervention can be conceived in this way, as it is not an absolute limitation.
1.1.5.5.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Free will is thwarted endlessly by our conscience created by God as well as by angels involving themselves in our lives.
1.1.5.5.1.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.4.
1.1.5.5.1.1.4.3. Con: Lack of free will would prevent meaningful relationships between man and God.
1.1.5.5.1.1.4.4. Con: Because all people are born in sin, eradicating evil would make God send all men to Hell. [There would be no one left.](https://www.gotquestions.org/God-allow-evil.html)
1.1.5.5.1.1.4.4.1. Con: If one considers the Bible as a valid source, then this is only true before the death of Jesus Christ, as by his sacrifice, he has freed those who believe in him from sin \(1 Peter 1:22\). Evil is therefore not necessary to avoid hell, only believing in Jesus is.
1.1.5.5.1.1.4.5. Con: God may feel that free will is sufficiently important to justify allowing evil to exist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.4.6. Con: Love could not exist without free will \(or consent depending on what definition of love one is talking about\).
1.1.5.5.1.1.4.7. Con: Courage could not exist if we could not choose to accept risk \(and it would be immoral to force risk\) for greater purposes.
1.1.5.5.1.1.4.8. Con: The argument is not that it is important. The argument is that it is logically necessary for the establishment of morality
1.1.5.5.1.1.5. Con: Even if the existence of free will requires the existence of certain evils, there are many evils in the world whose existence has nothing to do with free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1. Pro: Even if human-made evil must exist in order to grant humans free will, this does not explain the existence of non-human evils like natural disasters.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Much natural suffering is simply a result of the operations of the natural laws of the world, which are not themselves bad.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Natural evil is still evil, but not sinful.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Claiming that natural disasters are evidence for the existence of evil is to anthropomorphize them.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.1.3. Con: To suppose God allows suffering is just as evil as directly inflicting it in some cases.  Case in point is child sexual abuse.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.1.4. Con: Results are often exactly what we define as "evil." To say that natural suffering is never evil is precisely to say that many evils, such as death, destruction, and pain, are not evil. This would limit evil solely to agents with intents. The destruction of entire towns by natural disasters or even the pain from a paper cut are still evils.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.1.5. Con: Even if suffering is not evil, it is still bad, and a benevolent God would not create unnecessary badness.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.1.6. Con: If God exists, and is both the creator and controller of all creation, then all actions good and bad are the result of an "agent with intent." Inaction to prevent evil would also qualify as an act of evil. Therefore disasters and other misfortunes would qualify as "evil" in the anthropomorphic sense.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: The existence of natural disasters shows that some evil exists beyond the amount necessary to give humans free will. Since a benevolent God would not create unnecessary evil, God cannot exist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: Natural evil can be coming from powerful free-willing evil being\(s\) - the devil/the demons/etc. The omnibenevolent God existence is still logically possible.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3. Con: According to the character-building [defenses](https://www.iep.utm.edu/hick/), some virtues may be contingent on evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1. Pro: The Bible tells us that God created both good and evil to develop the spiritual wisdom of those of his creation who will be saved and live with God eternally. Evil is required to show the wrong ways. Experience / suffering is required to develop created spirits. God wishes for us to be wise. Not just alive.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.1. Con: If God is all-powerful, than he could give humans wisdom without the use of suffering. If God perfectly good, he would have chosen to do so without the use of suffering. Since suffering exists, God must either not be perfectly good or all powerful, and therefore He cannot be God.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.2. Pro: The incommensurable good of eternal life outweighs the existence of suffering.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.2.1. Con: God gifting us with a mediocre life on Earth plus an eternally good life is still worse than God gifting us with a perfect life on Earth plus an eternally good life.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Suffering may be necessary to develop character and [virtues](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.512), which may in turn be necessary for the sort of eternal life that manifests the greatest feasible good. For example, it may be better to experience eternal life as a being with certain characteristics and virtues that were only attainable through temporal suffering.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5. Con: We learn many things without directly experiencing them. For God it should be easy to teach us without making us suffer.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1. Con: It may be logically incoherent for God to give people certain virtues without using certain evils to develop these virtues.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: For example, a person may only be able to develop compassion if there exist suffering individuals to have compassion on. Suffering requires the existence of evil. Therefore, evil would be necessary for people to develop compassion.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.2. Pro: For example, a person may only be able to develop courage with the existence of dangers. Dangers require the possibility of evil and suffering. If so, evil would be necessary for humans to develop courage.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.2.1. Con: Courage is a virtue only in face of danger. If danger didn't exist courage would not be a virtue or necessary to exist at all.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Courage, generosity, and other similar virtues may constitute logically necessary foundations upon which to develop a new set of transcendent virtues, which we are incapable of developing or understanding on this side of the veil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.2.1.1.1. Con: There is no evidence for this or even a logical reason to assume it.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.2.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: There are [other reasons](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/does-god-exist/) to believe God \(a maximally great being\) exists, raising the probability that such sufficient reasons also exist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.3. Con: Such a limitation would contradict God's omnipotence. If God is omnipotent, than he would be powerful enough to provide people with these virtues without needing to rely on evil to do so.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.3.1. Con: Omnipotence means that God can do anything \(any "thing"\). However, not all described actions are really coherent, and thus not really "things." For example, God cannot create a two-sided triangle, because such a described action is incoherent. Similarly, it may be incoherent for God to teach us certain virtues without without using evil. If so, then such a limitation would not contradict his omnipotence as traditionally understood.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.3.1.1. Con: If god cannot alter the rules of logic and math to create the impossible then he is not all powerful.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.2.3.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.4. Pro: For example, it may be logically impossible for humans to develop the virtues of fortitude, patience, and reliance on God without the existence of suffering. If God eliminated natural evils \(cancer, parasites, etc.\), then humans would be incapable of developing fortitude, patience, and reliance on God. A world with humans who possess these virtues may be greater than one without these virtues. If so, then the greatest feasible world would require the existence of such evils.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.5. Con: Different people are born with different set of virtues therefore God gives certain virtues from the start without us needing to develop them.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.6. Pro: Suffering can sometimes lead to deeper understanding and fuller experience of love and goodness. If a kid skins her knee, there is suffering, but if she is comforted and taken care of as she heals, she may experience joy watching herself becoming whole again. In this world, there is some pain that is so great that we can not imagine any goodness coming from it. Its possible that an all-powerful and loving God has the capacity to redeem even the worst suffering possible in this world.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.6.1. Con: There are some forms of evil so horrifying and grotesque that it would be obscene to regard them as leading to a greater good. Think about the existence of; bone marrow cancer in babies, Malaria and Aids in African children, Children born into underground sex culture. For God to have the capacity to redeem even the worst suffering possible is to undermine the absolute worst.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.7. Con: The Bible does not tell us God created evil. Evil appears to pre-exist the creation of the world and is otherwise unexplained.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2. Con: Many of the reasons given to explain the existence of evil from theists like human freewill or the fall of man overlook the fact that there has been millions of years of animal suffering before humans ever existed. Nature lets the weak animals die, often slow and horrid deaths. This may not disprove God but it's certainly strong evidence against.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.1. Pro: Also within the "Natural Law" as stated, is the idea of "investment" in which creatures invest in the welfare of weaker ones for long-term benefit
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.2. Con: We lack the omniscient perspective to know or even gauge the probability of whether the total amount of suffering throughout history \(of humans or animals\) warrants its use. Thus, the objection above is effectively a wash. It doesn't do anything to raise or lower the probability of God's existence, since we lack the omniscient perspective necessary to make the relevant measurements.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: It is impossible to quantify the likelihood of an omnipotent being using a particular evil to further some greater good. God's omniscience means that there could be a butterfly-effect of causation at play that human beings are simply unable to measure. Thus, God may have a multitude of sufficient reasons for using diseases like smallpox and other forms of suffering, even though we may never know what all of these reasons are.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: An omnipotent God would surely not require such a blunt tool as suffering to achieve his ends. In fact, to suggest that any tool is required aside from his will itself, is analogous to suggesting that there are rules that bind him - thus contradicting his own omnipotence. A butterfly-effect of causation, while compatible with omniscience, is not required for any given end result if the creator is also omnipotent.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.2.1.2.1. Con: It is impossible for us to know or even gauge the likelihood that such actions are blunt tools on God's part. Use of suffering may involve an incredible amount of precision once a butterfly-effect of causation is taken into account. We lack the omniscent perspective to judge whether or not this is the case, or even make estimates about its likelihood.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.2.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.2.2. Con: Classical God could avoid evil, because of his omnipotence.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: God may have sufficient reasons for not desiring to do avoid evil. For example, eliminating evil from the greatest feasible world may require breaking the laws of logic, which may be immoral to do, and a perfect being would not desire to commit an immoral act.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.3. Con: That suffering occurs in nature does not provide strong evidence against the existence of God. It merely suggests that evil pre-exists, or is necessarily connected, with nature.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.3. Pro: There is a good possibility that the reason god does not intervene is because we are all on a path to our own personal perfection. God wants the best for us, however doing everything for us does not accomplish that in any permanent way.
\(Based upon the readings performed by Edgar Cayce, and the resulting theory of our lives\)
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.4. Pro: Without significant stakes, our choices lack the seriousness necessary to develop virtues. For example, we could not develop courage without facing serious danger, or we could not develop compassion without suffering people to have compassion on.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.4.1. Con: If god cannot develop virtues in us without pain and suffering then he is not all powerful.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.3.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.3.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.4.3. Con: There might be many virtues that are good but we don't have or are even aware of.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.4.4. Con: Why is courage, for example, a necessary virtue, or even a good virtue to have?
We only need it because there is danger in this world. People in heaven have no use for courage or other virtues \(like being generous\).
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.2.1.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.5. Pro: Monotheists often refer to God as Father. Children of fathers may become fathers themselves. If God were in the business of developing children who may advance to be as he is, the ability to make independent choices would explain the evil that exists in a universe also filled by an omnipotent and omniscient god who permits consequences of his children's choices to teach them to become as he is, even if their independent choices may manifest as evil during their initial development and training.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.6. Pro: Mankind's progress is a historical reality. Slavery, torture and the death penalty have been abolished, private wars have globally receded for centuries, and education and healthcare have grown.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.6.1. Con: Hunger, modern slavery \(people working in fabrics 14 hours every day\), unemployment, still affects billions of people. Pollution, wars and risk of wars that could wipe out life from heart, evil people with advanced arsenals, are now a reality. Therefore, it's arguable that human condition is getting better.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.6.1.1. Pro: Relative to historical norms, the world is [less violent](https://ourworldindata.org/slides/war-and-violence/#/1) and [more wealthy](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/amazing-chart-shows-thanks-to-capitalism-global-poverty-is-at-its-lowest-rate-in-history/article/2562224) than any other time in human history.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.6.2. Con: Stating that mankind is progressing without giving an objective reference point is a tautology. It is implying the current values as the measure of progress, and is essentially saying that mankind has become more like it is now than it has been previously, which is always true, but proves nothing outside of itself.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.6.3. Con: An omnibenevolent God would not allow unnecessary evil to exist at any time. Thus, a God who gradually diminishes death, war and disease would still not be an omnibenevolent God.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.6.3.1. Con: God is conflictingly described as wrathful by many holy texts.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.7. Pro: Strength, resolve, heroism, wisdom, etc. are all forged in struggle and tragedy. These things couldn't exist in a utopian world.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.8. Pro: The existence of evil and the ability to commit evil acts is necessary in order to make acts of altruism, compassion, and heroism morally meaningful.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.8.1. Con: The virtue in altruism, compassion, and heroism is that they serve to mitigate evil.  In a world with no evil, they would not be needed, and thus we would not miss them.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.8.2. Pro: Total freedom also means the chance to choose how to right wright or wrong. Evil is an option not a condition.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.9. Pro: In order to earn their place in Heaven, people must be able to demonstrate their possession of important virtues.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.9.1. Con: Since God presumably created Heaven also, there is no necessary reason to connect a place in Heaven with a concept of merit.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10. Con: Even if virtues require the existence of evil, a world with no evil and no virtues is better than a world with evil and with virtues.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.1. Pro: Only some virtues depend upon evil. Eliminating evil would still allow for other virtues and thus a greater net good.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.1.1. Pro: [Temperance](http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2s.htm) is the virtue to live indulge in your pleasures with moderation, which does not depend on evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.1.2. Pro: [Courage](http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2s.htm) in the face of danger is a virtue that is not solely dependent on evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.1.3. Pro: [Friendliness](http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2s.htm) is a virtue that is, "a mean between the excess of being ingratiating and the deficiency of being surly."
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.1.4. Pro: Aristotle takes [magnanimity](http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2s.htm), the greatness of the soul, as one of the greatest virtues. It is the moderate position between overconfidence and timidness.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.1.5. Pro: [Generosity](http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2s.htm) is a virtue pertaining to the moderate expenditure of resources, and does not depend on evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.1.5.1. Con: Without the vice of greed, generosity is not a virtue.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.1.6. Con: All virtues have corresponding [vices](http://changingminds.org/explanations/values/seven_virtues.htm). To possess any virtue implies having resisted the temptation to give in to a corresponding vice. For example, a generous person has resisted the temptation to be stingy, or a magnanimous person has resisted the temptation to be overconfident or timid. Temptations require the existence of evil. Thus, virtues are predicated on the existence of evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.1.7. Con: The virtues stemming from overcoming evil may be greater than those which do not. Thus, God may accomplish a greater good by allowing evil in order to enable these greater virtues.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.2. Pro: Evil enables the existence of vices \(like cruelty\) as well as the existence of virtues. Insofar as the existence of virtues is morally good, the existence of vices is presumably morally bad.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.2.1. Con: The net good of enabling virtues vastly outweighs the net evil of enabling of vices.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.2.1.1. Pro: Virtues may enable a person to enter into eternal life with God, which is an incommensurable good. Any byproduct "vices" enabled in this process would be infinitely outweighed by the potential of unity with the divine.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.3. Pro: The existence of extreme suffering and deprivation is so morally bad that it cannot be outweighed by the existence of virtues.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.3.1. Con: There is no way to know this or even to gauge its probability, because our vantage point as human beings is far too limited. The net good of virtues may be far beyond our ability to reckon.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.3.1.1. Con: Similarly, there is no way to gauge the probability of a world with virtues and evil being better than a world without virtues and without evil. At best, this leaves us neutral about the virtues objection.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.3.1.2. Pro: You cannot compare both worlds if you haven't lived/experienced life in them. \(It's hard to imagine a world with no evil and no virtues, to begin with\).
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.4. Con: Virtues are what make life morally meaningful. A world without virtues would be a world lacking in moral meaning.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.5. Con: C.S. Lewis once said; "without the potential for pain, nothing is at stake". Just like famine increases the value of food, and hunger drives us to eat, the value of concepts like love increases by the possibility \(and the pain\) of them potentially not existing
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.10.3.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11. Con: The suggestion that  God can not find a way to let us learn those virtues without evil is contradictory to the idea of him begin all powerful.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11.1. Pro: The exercise of these virtues does not require the presence of evil; it merely requires the presence of a spectrum of goodness.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11.1.1. Pro: Grace could be extended by very good, very competent people to slightly less good, slightly less competent people. It does not require the existence of evil people.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11.1.2. Pro: Mercy could be offered to people who have committed minor infractions. It does not require people to commit truly horrific crimes.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11.1.3. Con: Courage requires the existence of real danger, which in turn implies the existence of some real suffering.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11.1.4. Con: Even if these virtues could be technically exercised without evil, they are exercised most meaningfully when they are exercised in the face of true evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11.1.4.1. Pro: Mercy is meaningful only insofar as it involves pardoning great wrongs, or assuming a high cost in order to pardon someone. These things require the offence to be very great.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11.1.5. Con: For all we know, we could be living with the appropriate spectrum of goodness; perhaps we do not know what true evil is because we have never encountered it.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11.2. Pro: Some character traits do not require evil in order to flourish \(e.g. teamwork through sport or intelligence through learning\). Character building could still be a feature of human existence without evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11.3. Con: Many virtues require evil to exist by their very definition. For example, mercy is a response to someone who has committed evil acts. Since evil is part of the definition of "mercy," even an omnipotent God cannot create mercy without evil, since even an omnipotent God cannot disobey the rules of logic.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11.3.1. Con: While this holds true logically, there is no reason as to why mercy is a necessity. Mercy cannot exist without evil, however, a merciless world with no need for mercy is not logically inconsistent either. This argument implies the creation of the virtue of mercy with the knowledge that it necessitated the creation of evil. Mercy is not requisite for creation.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.11.4. Con: Omnipotence means that God can do anything \(any "thing"\). However, not all described actions are coherent, and therefore not really "things". For example, God creating a two-sided triangle is not coherent, and so not a thing. Similarly, it may be logically incoherent for God to teach us virtues without using evils. Therefore, such an action may be impossible for God to commit due to its incoherence. This would not contradict his omnipotence as traditionally understood.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.12. Con: It is possible to possess a virtue without ever instantiating it. For example, it is possible for a courageous person to never be put in a position to exercise their courage. So God could create a universe full of maximally good and virtuous people, who just happen to never exercise their virtues because there is no evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.12.1. Con: The exercise of virtues, rather than the mere possession of virtues, is what is morally significant.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.12.2. Con: The premise that a subject "is courageous" presupposes knowledge about that subject that can only be gained a posteriori by time-bounded minds such as ours. One would require God's perspective \(all-knowing, all-creating, and existing in all times simultaneously\) to make a valid statement about the character of a subject that has not yet been put to the test in real time.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.12.3. Con: I have the potential to climb Mt Everest but that doesn't mean I deserve the respect and admiration of someone who actually has climbed Mt Everest. I could be a person who has the virtue of patience but has never had to wait for anything, how much value would my virtue of patience then have?
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.12.4. Con: It may still be a greater good to create beings whose virtues derive from character growth through overcoming evils.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.13. Pro: Courage \(good\) implies adversity \(evil\), mercy implies undeserved reprieve for a wrongdoer, grace implies unmerited favor, and forgiveness implies having-been-wronged.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.14. Con: So, God may have created \(say\) smallpox in order that people might develop smallpox resistance. Why would God want such a thing, when in heaven there is no smallpox? Why would he desire people to possess the virtue of fortitude, when in heaven there is no hunger; or chastity, when in heaven there is no sex?
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.14.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.2.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.14.2. Con: This is analogous to the [god of the gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps) fallacy, because it appeals to gaps in theological knowledge in order to disprove God's existence. Just because we do not know how God will use a particular evil does not mean that a sufficient reason does not exist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.15. Pro: Evil exists on a spectrum of badness, of which all humans contribute, to some degree. God could have made humans incapable of badness, instead he chose to give us free will so that human goodness would have extra meaning.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.4. Con: Judeo-Christian traditions believe that God placed the created world under the care and rule of humanity, and in doing so entrusted the fate of creation to humanity. The disorder in the natural world \(eg. natural disasters\) is a reflection of the disorder within humanity due to sin.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.5. Con: Natural disasters are part of a changing world and have effects that are fortunate for some and unfortunate for others. They are not good or evil in the absolute.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.5.1. Con: Natural disasters are less than perfectly good. A benevolent God would therefore not allow them to exist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.2. Pro: Evil and suffering does not always imply free-will. Sickness  strikes blindly since kids can have bone cancer and some insects have a parsitic life-cylcle which implies parasiticly festering before sprawling through eyes and such. How many people are massacred for reasons entirely not of their will? This, a lawful and good god would not let happen.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.2.1. Con: It is true that certain evils \(natural evils\) are not caused by human choices. However, it is possible that natural evils are necessary to achieve other greater goods.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: For example, it may be logically impossible for humans to develop the virtue of compassion without the existence of suffering people to have compassion on. If God eliminated natural evils \(cancer, parasites, etc.\), then humans would be incapable of developing compassion. A world with compassionate humans may be greater than one without such virtues. If so, then the greatest feasible world would require the existence of such evils.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.4.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.2.2. Con: God's purpose for this life is for us to gain experiences necessary for what comes next. For the purposes of God to be accomplished, this life must be temporary. God allows death and suffering because it is necessary for our greater good.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.2.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.4. Con: If one considers evil to be a choice which brings about suffering and the suffering itself to be a morally neutral consequence of evil, then there are no evils that exist apart from choice.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.5. Con: Mundane experience is inconsequential, other than as a spiritual test, therefore nothing unpleasant that happens on earth should properly be regarded, in itself, as evil or evidence of evil.  Evil exists only in the context of intent, which God deliberately does not control, in order to allow for the possibility of salvation.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.5.1. Pro: Evil does not mean "all bad things." Evil applies to the cause, not the effect. Suffering is not evil. Intentionally causing someone to suffer is evil. Therefore, natural occurring phenomenon, like hurricanes, illness, or car accidents are not evil, and the original question clearly and specifically references evil, not "all bad things."
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.6. Con: Evil, by definition, requires intent; and intent is a manifestation of free will. Suffering is not evil. Intentionally causing someone to suffer is evil. Therefore, natural occurring phenomenon, like hurricanes, illness, or car accidents cannot be properly defined as evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.5.6.1. Pro: Even natural predators, such as lions are not seen as "evil", despite hunting and killing other animals and even humans, because of their lack of free will
1.1.5.5.1.1.6. Con: Moral goodness can exist without free will. For example, giving a sentient being who lacks free will more pleasure creates moral goodness.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.1. Con: Pleasure does not equate with goodness.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.1.1. Con: Pleasure is not identical to moral goodness, but it is one component of moral goodness. Clearly, a world with more pleasure is morally better than a world without one.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Whilst moral goodness and pleasure are both worth pursuing, and a morally perfect society will ideally have pleasure involved, there is no causal link between pleasure and  good morality. For example, a civilisation that indulges in cannibalism and murder but enjoys it is not morally better than one that avoids such activities.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.1.3. Pro: Pleasure does not even equate with real happiness. Accomplishment often comes from sacrifice and committed effort and is often unpleasant, but is far more rewarding than pleasure.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.2. Con: If a being doesn't have free will then it cannot act of its own volition. That means it can't make choices, which in turn means that that being cannot act in a 'good' or 'bad' way. Another way to look at it is like a machine that's been programmed. It's just executing the code without the choice to change it.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.2.1. Con: Programs can do good or bad things even if they are not morally responsible for these things. Thus, there is a sense in which a "programmed" machine could be called good or evil without reference to free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: The program is not responsible for the moral outlook of its actions. A program's "goodness" can only be categorized in regards to how well it executes its intended purpose. The purpose itself is defined by its creator. Therefore the creator is responsible for the morality of the machine.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.3. Pro: We ascribe good and evil values to many actions that do not require free will.
Many heroes that saved lives report doing it instinctively and on impulse yet we don't judge them any less heroic or good.
There are people who are physically and mentally incapable of killing, for example, yet we don't see them as being incapable of good for that reason.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.3.1. Con: Natural disasters are generally side effects of things that usually are required for life to exist in the first place. Earthquakes arise from Earth's high internal temperature which also creates our magnetic field. You can't make a universe that never behaves counter to the needs of humans without manually controlling it.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: Life adopts to many harsh conditions. This does not mean that those conditions are necessary or even beneficial to life.
It does not follow that it's impossible to have life or other benefits without natural disasters.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.3.2. Con: God may also use natural evils to develop virtues, such as courage, fortitude, etc. In the example above, these heroic acts were only possible because of dangers that other people were experiencing. If God didn't allow these dangers to exist, then it would have been impossible for people to develop heroic virtues. "Choosing" whether or not to engage in heroic \(or other character-developing actions\) requires the existence of some form of evil \(e.g. dangers, suffering, etc.\)
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.3.2.2. Con: In the original example the people did not choose to act. They describe it as a reflex and often refuse to take credit for the act.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.3.2.2.1. Con: In such circumstances we interpret their denials as humility. If they truly made no choice then they would not have acted heroically. It would be no different than a robot saving someone.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.3.2.2.2. Pro: Often they attribute their actions to being guided by God yet we still call them heroes.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.3.2.2.2.1. Con: A guide does not necessarily circumvent choice. Such attributions are often a form of humility, which is another virtue.
1.1.5.5.1.1.6.4. Con: That only works if the giver has free will. So it begs the question
1.1.5.5.1.1.7. Pro: Certain aspects of moral goodness are only possible with free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.1. Pro: A world in which evil is rejected rationally is ultimately better than one in which evil is prevented by programmed mental limitation, or one in which evil is prevented through intimidation by the threat of instant punishment.
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.8.
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.3. Pro: God might withhold Himself from correcting evil \(at least for a time\) in order to allow us, in our freedom, the opportunity to correct it ourselves by coming into closer relationship with Him \(who is goodness and love\).
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.3.1. Con: "Evil" might not be human made, but natural \(natural catastrophes and disease\). That argument does not hold up in this circumstances, as we can not correct it.
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.3.1.1. Con: In certain religious systems all evil, even natural is a result of human actions. Classic Christian orthodoxy holds, "the fall of man" caused the earth itself to be cursed \(e.g. in a state of evil\).
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.3.2. Con: God could simply make us closer to him in the first place; there is no reason to require that we correct evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.4. Pro: Instead of conceiving evil in terms of "lack of something", try to consider it as a necessary part of free will and therefore love. For example, how would anyone be aware of living if there were no death?
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.4.1. Con: Day to day experiences are sufficient to be aware of being alive, and death is not a necessary condition of this awareness.
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.5. Pro: On most readings, the doing of evil implies that someone has a moral choice and chooses the less honorable and generally easier or more munificent path in a situation. There cannot be moral choice without evil being a credible option, so evil exists in the world. We know moral choice is intrinsic to being human, so any creator who had actually created man, not just his image, would have to create evil as a byproduct.
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.5.1. Con: Psychology has a long history of studying how people make choices, including good vs evil choices, in environments where people are not actually hurt. Stanley Milgrim's famous experiments on conformity, where a confederate pretended to be shocked, allowed for studying if people would make an easy choice that hurt others, or a harder choice to disobey an experimenter. Suggesting that God cannot allow humans to make choices without hurting others means God is less clever than a psychologist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.6. Con: Even if certain aspects of moral goodness require the existence of free will, God might be able to create a maximally good world by populating the world with an infinite amount of the types of moral goodness that don't require free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.7. Pro: The Christian Bible puts emphasis on the divine importance of humans being able to make choices. The existence of choice is dependent on the ability to make a "wrong" choice, or in this context: the ability to do evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.7.7.1. Con: If the ability to make a "wrong" choice does not have to be actualized -- that is, if there is a possible world in which people have the ability to choose wrong but do not -- then an all-powerful god could simply actualize that world.
1.1.5.5.1.1.8. Pro: Non-relative Evil is implying God as creator, law-giver and highest good, and vice versa. Evil in a world greated good can only happen if there are agents able to decide for good or evil. They must henceforth be free and free to abuse their freedom. Thus they and not God are the authors and causes of evil. Or a demon seducing them. Orthodoxy is consistent but only as the whole package.
1.1.5.5.1.1.9. Pro: Evil and God are separate subjects because God created the world but did not decide for it how it should or should not be that's up to us. Natural disasters should not be evils as they are part of the circle of nature to keep things balance. But evils  like human slaughter and wars are all results of humans having their own minds and deciding to take such actions.
1.1.5.5.1.1.10. Con: If meaningful free will requires the choosing of evil, than there is no meaningful free will in heaven.
1.1.5.5.1.1.10.1. Con: Satan willingly chose to betray God and was banished from heaven. It is possible that all other heavenly beings choose not to follow his example. As such, the traditional conceptions of heaven do include a concept of free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.10.1.1. Con: This implies that after the final judgment occurs, at some point during the eternity of the heavenly afterlife, there will again be rebellion and betrayal. If God has ensured this will certainly not happen, and if agents in heaven are free, then free will and the absence of evil can co-exist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.10.2. Con: This suggestion is a straw man. Purposefully omitting the word possibility in order to form its counterpoint.
1.1.5.5.1.1.11. Con: Surely God would know that there is no moral goodness without evil and since God must be purely good, then there would have been no creation of beings with free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.11.1. Con: Assumes morality is not a human construct
1.1.5.5.1.1.11.2. Con: Assumes god must be purely good. He could be purely bad or anywhere inbetween
1.1.5.5.1.1.12. Con: Free will is a red herring. There is evil in the world that has nothing to do with the moral choices of people \(such as horrible diseases and natural disasters\) which prove that if there is an omnipotent god, it is not omnibenevolent.
1.1.5.5.1.1.12.1. Con: Evil is not the same as pain. Natural disasters and diseases are painful events, but they are not immoral or wicked. It is another discussion whether a benevolent God would allow a world where we can experience pain.
1.1.5.5.1.1.12.1.1. Con: The "problem of evil" as traditionally discussed includes disease, natural disasters and so forth as "evils" which the world would be better off without. They are not excluded from the category of "evils" just because they have no moral agency of their own, because if God exists then God is morally responsible for them as the agent who created them.
1.1.5.5.1.1.12.2. Pro: The concept of evil is a human construct. God doesn't need to be constrained to and judged by this definition \(i.e. higher-plan argument\).
1.1.5.5.1.1.12.3. Con: Free will is a fundamental underpinning to the concept of moral good and evil. Without meaningful choice, there is no concept of making good or bad choices. As seen in the difference between a predator killing prey, and a human committing murder.
1.1.5.5.1.1.13. Con: The idea that God gave us free will is a self-cancelling concept since we weren't given a choice. Thus, free will cannot be God-given. So it follows that God is interested in neither our choices nor evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.14. Pro: A triune god cannot exist, but the true God does exist. He allows evil for a brief time because he gives intelligent creation free will. However, Evil will not exist forever, as a Psalm states: 
"When the wicked sprout like weeds
And all the wrongdoers flourish,
It is that they may be annihilated forever." \(Psalm 92:7\)
1.1.5.5.1.1.14.1. Con: This claim argues that evil is compatible with God because evil is temporary. But if God was loving, all-knowing, and powerful, even temporary evil would be an anathema.
1.1.5.5.1.1.14.1.1. Con: No it wouldn't; if there is some greater good that persists infinitely, then it ought to be worth temporary evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.14.1.2. Con: To simply assert that an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent God would consider evil anathema begs the question. The assertion assumes without argument or evidence that such a God could have no good reason for allowing temporary evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15. Con: If God cannot maintain freewill while preventing evil, then God is not omnipotent.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1. Pro: It is possible to create a world with free will but no evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1. Pro: There is nothing logically contradictory about a free agent who nevertheless always chooses to do good. So there is nothing logically contradictory about a world full of free agents who always choose to do good, and therefore God could create such a world.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.1. Con: A free agent who always chooses good reflects the goodness of him or her self, not the world into which he or she was created. A free agent who always chooses good is exactly what Jesus is characterized as, and yet even he faced temptation, and suffered greatly.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.2. Pro: In JudeoChristian tradition, God will create an evil-free universe since evil will never come back after the Final Judgement
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.2.1. Con: The Perfect Universe that will exist after Judgement will be filled with those whom have known and overcome evil. Evil will have been necessary to refine those souls into people worthy of such a Universe.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.3. Con: A universe without free beings choosing evil also logically denies the right to exist to morally good beings.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.3.1. Pro: Some beings that would not choose evil if they know how bad it is would fail to understand how bad evil really is in a universe devoid of evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.3.1.1. Con: By assumption, no individual in this universe would choose to act evilly, so this is not a relevant concern.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.3.2. Pro: Some beings that choose evil do repent when they truly understand how bad it is, they morally deserve to exist if they don't reproduce their crimes.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.3.2.1. Con: It's unclear how someone can "deserve to exist," since prior to existing, they don't exist, and therefore can't deserve anything.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.4. Con: An omnibenevolent God also loves evildoers and would desire them to exist, choose evil, repent, and never sin again.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.4.1. Con: If god desires for people to choose evil, then he is not good.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.4.2. Pro: Omnibenevolence contains "OMNI", which means everyone, not only perfectly good guys.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.4.3. Pro: In christian tradition, he desires to create and live with evildoers so much that he would help them to repent even over his dead body \(Jesus crucified\)
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.4.4. Con: While an omnibenevolent God might love evildoers, God would presumably love good-doers more \(if only for their effects on others\), so God would create good-doers instead.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.1.5. Pro: Since God is omnipotent, God can create any world which is not logically contradictory.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.2. Pro: Moral agency can be exercised through decisions to make supererogatory acts or not, and not merely decisions to make impermissible acts or not.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.2.1. Con: Morally significant free will does not just require choice, but also a meaningful range of choices. Freedom to choose whether to donate $99 or $100 to charity is not significant. A range of possible actions - including evil ones - would need to be present in order for free will to be significant.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.2.2. Pro: A world in which some creatures chose to praise God and plan surprise parties for strangers, and others chose to fill life with harmless but meaningless pleasures, would be a world with moral agency and differentiation, but without evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.3. Pro: We could imagine a world in which moral agents had the capacity to choose evil, but in which their ability to act on this choice was severely restricted.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.3.1. Con: In such a world, choice would be meaningless. Thus we couldn't say that this world really contained free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.3.1.1. Con: The relationship between restrictions and freedom is more complicated than this. Creativity is empowered through [constraints](https://www.wired.com/2011/11/need-to-create-get-a-constraint/).
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.4. Pro: Free will without the ability to commit evil acts is a coherent concept, so free will doesn't explain the existence of evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.4.1. Pro: Even free will WITH the ability to commit evil acts--but the actor never commits them--is a coherent concept, so free will is not necessary for the existence of evil. Imagine if god created infinite worlds where free beings died or were 'raptured' just before they 'sinned.' Each of those free beings in unique contexts would likely have different amounts of time alive--lengths of personal history in the world--that would presumably count as having genuinely 'lived' without sinning.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.4.1.1. Pro: Considering the Christian God, Adam and Eve were depicted as having lived for quite some time before they 'sinned' in Eden. Perhaps even though the lives of those who were allowed to sin \(e.g. so as not to violate free will\) are generally longer, being tainted by sin, they should be considered superfluously long. We may just need to get used to valuing the idea and benefits of living a typically shorter lifespan.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.4.2. Pro: Many consider God to be a coherent concept of a being who is free to act without committing evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.5. Pro: The existence of unbounded evil is not necessary to create the possibility of choosing evil. For example God could have engineered the world where pedophilia was physically/biologically/cognitively impossible but still allow other evils so free-will or choice could be tested.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.5.1. Con: If God had made child molestation impossible, then someone would make the same parent claim naming a different type of evil which God could have prevented.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.5.1.1. Con: Although this is true, it still does not justify or explain the existence of child molestation, from God's perspective.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.6. Con: What one person considers evil, another person considers moral. There is no objective stance for evil. Also a person like Eichmann can act against his own concept of good and commit evil as an administrator for what he perceives is the public will. Thus the banality of evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.7. Con: Evil things related to free will are mistakes. In order to avoid those mistakes, one would have to know everything. Such a being is God. A world with free will but no evil would be a world where everyone knows everything, therefore "they" would be God.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.8. Con: This suggests that we would have free will, but our choices in any scenario would be non-evil, or something other than wrong or bad.  This eliminates free will because we have no option to act in a manner intentionally harmful to others
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.9. Con: Free choice is possible without evil, but free will is not. Free choice enables certain decisions to be made within an individuals life, but free will allows one to go against god in a variety of capacities including committing evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.1.9.1. Con: Free will is not about going against the Omnipotent. Free will determines the relationship between the creature and the Creator
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.2. Con: God can maintain freewill while preventing evil, but such a world may not be considered benevolent on a metaphysical scale.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.3. Con: Omnipotence does not require the ability to create logical fallacies.
1.1.5.5.1.1.15.4. Con: God gave us the duty to not be evil. To blame God for our bad decisions is merely trying to avoid our own responsibility.
1.1.5.5.1.1.16. Con: From the Augustinian perspective, as many human actions are predestined by the creator, there is not enough free will for there not to account this deity responsible for the existence of evil, which would deny His purpose by itself.
1.1.5.5.1.1.17. Con: [Science Leaves No Room For Free Will](https://www.kialo.com/science-leaves-no-room-for-free-will-1379/1379.0/1379.0)
1.1.5.5.1.1.17.1. Con: We have an immediate observation of something we call free will. Science has yet to figure out how that plays out.
1.1.5.5.1.1.17.1.1. Con: "Free will" is easily hijacked by any number of things. Fear, power, drugs, injury, etc
1.1.5.5.1.1.17.2. Con: Determinism is not a necessary result of what science has. It is one possible view, however, DeBroglie and Bohm's Pilot Wave Theory, which includes so called hidden variables, is the only fully deterministic theory available and right now it is not proven at this point. The most well-accepted theory, called the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, means that at the most fundamental level, the world is not deterministic, and thus not predestined.
1.1.5.5.1.1.17.2.1. Con: Indeterminacy also leaves no room for free will.
If something is non determined or random it is still not chosen.
1.1.5.5.1.1.17.3. Con: If God existed, free will could exist by divine mechanisms that science does not yet understand.
1.1.5.5.1.1.18. Con: It is contradictory for an omnipotent creator to allow free will while also punishing those who do not follow their command \(by disallowing entry into heaven\).
1.1.5.5.1.1.18.1. Con: Free wills existence allows easily for a better and worse choice. This assertion undermines the logic of the primary claim by rejecting the connection between morality and the choices made by beings who have it.
1.1.5.5.1.1.19. Pro: God loves his children, in a way they are allowed to perform acts of any nature – good or evil – according to their free will and in accordance with the cosmic laws of action and consequence.
1.1.5.5.1.1.19.1. Con: Evil choices do not necessarily need to lead to evil consequences
1.1.5.5.1.1.19.1.1. Pro: Virtual reality allows for people to make moral choices without allowing people to kill people.
1.1.5.5.1.1.20. Pro: Evil exists separate from God. God created us in his image to be gardeners of the world yet we chose to eat the symbolic apple of knowledge, giving us free will to decide on morality in terms of good and evil. God exists whole fully outside of evil and calls us to join him in Eden. Claiming the existence of evil in this life makes god incompatible is a fallacy as love, holiness and eternal life wait in the hereafter
1.1.5.5.1.1.21. Con: Free-will is an illusion. The choices we make are determined by our environment. There are an endless number of ways we can be manipulated or tricked against our will, from hypnosis, a compelling argument, drugs, even opening brain surgery...etc. When something happens to you, you don't choose to feel it, nor do you choose how it effects you. And whether you like it or not, the memory of it will effect your "choice."
1.1.5.5.1.1.21.1. Con: We can't control certain situations, but we can control how we respond to them. We can even choose to prepare beforehand on how we respond to a certain situation if it arises.
1.1.5.5.1.1.22. Pro: God grants free will, under penalty of eternal damnation, which is inherently not free. Evil that exists can not be disproven to be God but at the same time it means 'he/she' is either evil or benevolent seeing as he/she is all powerful, all knowing and all seeing.
1.1.5.5.1.1.23. Pro: The ability to choose between good and evil and live with the consequences is generally considered a more benevolent gift than enforcing goodness upon everyone, even if some make bad choices.
1.1.5.5.1.1.24. Con: If bringing about a universe with free will necessarily brings evil, then a morally perfect God is precluded from bringing about a universe with free will, however much he might desire the goods that would arise. If not, God can create a universe in which free will and the absence of evil co-exist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.24.1. Con: This suggestion begs the question of the premise without providing evidence for it.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25. Con: Free will and the traditional idea of a monotheistic god are antithetical by nature, if one exists the other cannot. Thus free-will cannot be an argument for the the coexistence of both a god and evil, as freewill in and of itself refutes the idea of such a god.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1. Pro: There is no free will if God is omniscient. You cannot have an entity with absolute prior knowledge of the outcome of any and all choices ever to be made, and have that choice be a free one.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.1. Con: The argument is not that there is an omniscient God. A monotheistic God does not have to be omniscient.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.2. Con: An Omniscient God does not defeat free will unless the God interferes with the choices.  Knowing the outcome does not necessarily equate to creating the outcome.  If the purpose of free will is for the growth of the one who makes the choice, God allows us to make those choices, even knowing that doing so may result in our failure or even harm to others.  Omniscience would however allow God to incorporate those choices \(good and bad\) into a master plan.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.3. Con: Libertarian free-will means that one is able to make decisions without causes external to oneself. There is no explicit reason why this is inconsistent with God's omniscience. God could know what we will freely choose to do, but that doesn't mean we lack the freedom to make such choices. In other words, the cause of our decision still resides in ourselves, regardless of God's knowledge of what the outcomes will be.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4. Con: Omniscience is interactive. We are free to make choices, and as we do, so does the God's omniscience update.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.1. Con: Omniscience means "knowing all things." "All things" includes future choices people make. Thus, what you describe isn't true omniscience. It is "knowing the present but not the future."
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.1.1. Con: Omniscience means knowing all members of the set called "things which can be known". "Future choices" are not the members of that set, until they become present. Until choice is manifested in the present, there is nothing to be known. God knows choices as soon as they manifest.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.1.1.1. Con: "Things which can be known" depends on the powers of the knower. If the knower is maximally great, then "things which can be known" would include all things, not just things in the present \(since it is greater to know all things than to know less-then-all\). Thus, the being you are describing would not be maximally great, and therefore not God as traditionally conceived.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: "Not just things in the present" is an exclusive set. Things that passed are members of that set, but things that did not yet happen are not. Events that happened are members of the set called "being". Events that did not happen are not members of the set "being". Future is a non-being.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is greater to transcend time then to be bound by time's laws. Therefore, a maximally great being would transcend time. Anything that exists in time \(whether past, present, or future\) would then be a form of being, and therefore knowable by an omniscient knower who transcends time.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Past events can be known by remembering. There is no method of knowledge equivalent to remembering that would cover future events.Foreseeing is a myth that works just like weather prognosis does. There is no future to be known, there are only estimations.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This argument begs the question, for it assumes that an all-powerful, all-knowing being does not exist, which is the matter under dispute. If such a being existed, then by definition he would have a method of knowledge capable of covering future events, since he is defined as all-knowing \(omniscient\).
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: God cannot introduce an absurd method. He cannot provide a video footage of an event that never happened.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.1.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.1.1.2. Con: If God is omnipresent, then the future is meaningless. That is, God's future knowledge should be identical with God's present knowledge.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.4.2. Pro: It pertains to an omniscient being to “know” that which is logically knowable, just as it pertains to an omnipotent being to be able to do what is logically possible. I.e., just as an omnipotent being cannot violate logic in making a rectangle square, so an omniscient being cannot know what is not actual, “true.”
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.5. Con: It is possible to know the outcome of every choice. Humans have that knowledge on a limited scale. A conditioned being is bound by a set of rules. This boundaries limit all choices only to the possible ones. A lab mouse in a box with only two doors has a limited choice for leaving or not leaving the box. The outcome is known for any choice it makes. Mouse is free to make its own choice, though.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.5.1. Con: External and internal factors outside the mouse's control almost solely determine his choice. Is the box on fire? Is there food/water/companionship/etc inside/outside the box? Is the mouse depressed/injured/impaired in some way?
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.6. Con: Just because God knows what will happen, that does not mean that He caused it.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.6.1. Con: We can lack free will even if it is not the case that God causes us to do everything we do. As long as all our decisions are in principle predictable, we lack free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.6.2. Con: Causation is not the claim. Absolute prior knowledge is. You may know your brother will brush his teeth with a fair amount of confidence, but not absolute prior knowledge. There is a vast difference.

Absolute prior knowledge negates the possibility of change. Can your brother surprise you? - Yes.
Can you surprise god? - Supposedly no.

No free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.7. Pro: Knowledge of outcome is evidence that we are much more like macros on a cpu  \(running predetermined processes on predetermined paths\) than sentient beings making independent choices in a universe that lacks predestination.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.8. Pro: If God is omniscient in the sense of knowing simply everything, including the exact details of the future, then the future is completely determinate, and so there is no free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.9. Pro: The possibility that God is capable of knowing everything does not mean that he always chooses to know everything about the future. The detailed work in the Universe, from microbes to massive galaxies implies that he can control the use of his power to a minute detail. This suggests that he can also control his ability to foresee the future \(possibly so as to allow intelligents agents to exercise their free will\)
1.1.5.5.1.1.25.1.9.1. Con: A benevolent God would not choose to "not know" evil things.
1.1.5.5.1.1.26. Con: If an omnipotent God created all things, that God also created the the realities of moral goodness and free will as suggested in this post. But if God is all powerful, God could have created a different moral law for which free will was not a factor, thus eliminating evil \(if evil is inherent to free will\).
1.1.5.5.1.1.27. Con: But then God could not have "free will" unless he too can sin. It would seem "free will" must be understood without any intrinsic penchant or ability to sin/do evil, even if, for us humans it seems to manifest as an ability to sin/do evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.27.1. Con: God could transcend normal human constraints on free will, or have a form of free will incomprehensible to us.
1.1.5.5.1.1.27.1.1. Con: If forms of free will that do not necessitate the option of doing evil exist, then God could give that sort of free will to his creations.
1.1.5.5.1.1.27.2. Con: Since God is omnipotent, God obviously has the capacity to sin, but chooses not to do so.
1.1.5.5.1.1.27.2.1. Pro: Christian God, Jesus, has been tempted ["just as we are" \(Hebrews 4.15\).](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4%3A15&version=KJV)
1.1.5.5.1.1.28. Pro: If God gave us free will, evil could be a rebellious act against God, so in this sense God and evil could coexist.
1.1.5.5.1.1.28.1. Pro: The only true evil is disconnection from God in one's heart, which is an act of free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.28.1.1. Con: Half true. God says that we must choose to know Him to have eternal life. If we rely only on our own feelings, then we choose to know only our own version of Him and not His true self.
1.1.5.5.1.1.28.1.2. Pro: This is the true purpose of your heart; He gave us the gift of emotion that we might be converted. Whether or not you then listen to your heart and know that He is God is a matter of your God-given free will. So; we can be saved by emotional awareness of Him but whether we remain saved is up to us alone - not Him - that is the true truth and that is His awesome plan for us.
1.1.5.5.1.1.29. Pro: By removing evil God would be disrupting free will. Evil deeds are committed by humans or by conscious beings regarding their actions. The good respects free will because forcing something on someone is usually a tyranny or even can take away the goodness of the act because it is not done genuinely,  but rather they would be forced to do good by nature instead of choosing to do good, which if often validated by many philosophers as a true good will. God respects free will because he is good
1.1.5.5.1.1.29.1. Con: God could have made it so humans did not want to be evil: we don't deliberately hurt ourselves even if we can - we just don't want to. 

There are plenty of things people generally don't want to do, even if we can. God could have applied the same principle on doing evil.
1.1.5.5.1.1.29.1.1. Con: We all existed before we were born into this world - God didn't create our personality, therefore our wants may not align with what He wants us to do and be. So He won't make us be what we don't want to be.
1.1.5.5.1.1.29.2. Con: Still does not adress the problem of evil in natural disasters or diseases. That still doesn’t answer the coexistence of “free will” and pediatric cancer.
1.1.5.5.1.1.29.3. Con: Preventing evil does not disrupt free will. If a police officer stops a murder, the person is still guilty of attempted murder. It is even less of an issue for an omniscient being, who does not have to allow the evil to be perpretated in order to know that it would have been done, if permitted. An all powerful and all knowing god could therefore intervene to stop evil from affecting any victims without forgoing anything interesting about free will.
1.1.5.5.1.1.29.3.1. Con: If God were known to eliminate all consequences of evil acts, they would cease to be evil in the sense that they were committed knowing harm would ensue.
1.1.5.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.
1.1.5.5.1.3. Con: God should be logical, so all we need is logic, and a logical, not a comprehensive explanation. Nobody needs omniscience to recognize the absurd. Suggested explanations are not logical.
1.1.5.5.1.3.1. Con: The above an inductive argument, which is a form of logic.
1.1.5.6. Con: Free will indeed implies the option of choosing evil. The best possible world implies all choices are perfect. All *possible* choices may not be perfect, but they are also not necessarily a reality, but only a possibility. Only perfect choices are the reality in a perfect world. Significant moral choices may be evil only if all possible choices are less than perfect. That should not be a case in the best of all possible worlds.
1.1.5.6.1. Con: The key term here is "possible."  Just because we can imagine a given world does not mean it is actually logically possible. Such worlds may involve incoherent entailments. Since we lack an omniscient perspective, it would be impossible to determine whether this is the case. Therefore, it is possible that we exist in the best possible world, even though we can imagine idyllic worlds that involve incoherent entailments we aren't privy to.
1.1.5.6.1.1. Con: If god cannot alter the rules of logic to avoid such entailments then he is not all powerful.
1.1.5.6.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.2.
1.1.5.6.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.1.5.6.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.2.
1.1.5.6.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.1.5.6.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.7. Pro: A thought experiment supports the need for evil in the best possible world: imagine the alternative. A world peopled by "individuals" who can only do good. These would not be individuals at all, but a series of different genetic groupings animated by the same Will. These all would be one being. Or they would be  a collection of slaves, unable to act outside proscribed boundaries. Evil exists as a condition of the fact of individuality, of which autonomy/agency is the hallmark.
1.1.5.8. Pro: For example, the best possible world may include the ability to make significant moral choices. Yet significant moral choices always involve the potential of suffering \(this is what makes them significant\). Therefore, suffering may be necessary in order for people to make any morally-significant choices, which may constitute a greater world than one in which no such choices can be made.
1.1.5.8.1. Con: The argument that an omnipotent god must choose a "best possible world" is erroneous at its core, as it contradicts the omnipotence of such a god. This is because to a omnipotent being there would be infinite possibilities for every choice and thus infinite possible worlds. Therefore making it possible for such a god to create a world where significant moral choices can be made without the potential for suffering, despite the implausibility of such a scenario.
1.1.5.8.1.1. Con: If sacrifice is to be considered a principle of moral benevolence that God desires to be exercised among his children then he must allow the potential for suffering.
1.1.5.8.1.2. Con: Sin has to be punished as it helps to deter sin. If God never put suffering into the world then the world would be a lot darker than it is now.
1.1.5.9. Pro: For example, the best possible world may include human beings with free will, and free will may require the possibility of choosing evil.
1.1.5.9.1. Pro: Mistakes and the ability to learn from them are central to human learning.
1.1.5.10. Pro: Good and evil must necessarily co-exist, thus a good God must co-exist with evil in some way.
1.1.5.10.1. Con: Good and evil are determined by moral judgements based on human consciousness, this we can be certain of.  This is a  dichotomy of human consciousness that should not be over-extended to describe concepts that defy definition.
1.1.5.10.1.1. Con: If this argument holds water, then it would also mean that we are unable to even address the parent claim \(that God and the existence of evil are incompatible\), since our understanding of transcendent reality would be too infantile to even apply logic or evidence-based arguments. As such, your argument here [doubles](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.11) as a con for the parent claim.
1.1.5.10.1.1.1. Con: Asserting inability to accurately percieve or define God based on God's transcendence of known reality does not prevent us from evaluating evil's relationship to a traditionally concieved God. Evil is a human concept that can be reasonably debated. God as conceived \(however incompletely or inaccurately\) can similarly be debated in relation to the existence of evil.
1.1.5.10.1.1.1.1. Con: To determine if two propositions are consistent with one another, one must understand the propositions. If I do not know what "X" signifies, than I have no way of knowing whether it is consistent with "Y". Likewise, if our faculties prohibit us from accurately perceiving or defining God, then there is no way to determine whether the proposition "God exists" is consistent with the proposition "evil exists".
1.1.5.10.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.10.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.10.1.2. Con: God can be in fact defined as a "maximally great being." Therefore, God \(as traditionally conceived\) is is not a concept that defies definition.
1.1.5.10.1.2.1. Pro: It is possible to define something without understanding everything about the object defined. For example, I can define the Orion Nebula as "a diffuse nebula situated in the Milky Way at X location" without knowing everything about the Orion Nebula. Similarly, I can define God as a "maximally great being" without knowing everything entailed by a maximally great being.
1.1.5.10.1.2.1.1. Pro: A maximally great being is defined as "a being possessing all great-making properties in maximally excellent form." Therefore, a maximally great being is not a concept that defies definition.
1.1.5.10.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: We can identify great-making properties through induction, logic, and intuition. For example, we can determine that knowledge is greater than ignorance, that being correct is greater than being mistaken, and that knowing all things is greater than knowing fewer than all things. Therefore, we can conclude that a maximally great being possesses the greatest of these properties, which is knowing all things and always being correct. As such, it follows that a maximally great being is omniscient.
1.1.5.10.2. Pro: There must be opposition in all things, therefore evil has to exist, you can't just have it one sided.  One of the main reasons we grow is  from our mistakes, from being tempted by that evil or resisting it.
1.1.5.10.2.1. Con: The proposition "there must be opposition in all things" is self-refuting. Followed logically, the proposition "there must be opposition in all things" must also have an opposition. This entails that some things must in fact not have an opposition. But if true, this would contradict the initial proposition. Thus, the proposition reduces itself to absurdity.
1.1.5.10.2.1.1. Con: The opposite of "Opposition in all things" is not something with out an opposite. It is, something that acts as its own opposite. Take friction, when you are standing on the floor, it is friction that keeps you from moving, but it is also friction that allows you to move across the floor. This is the same reasoning that states, the immovable object IS the unrelenting force and therefore can co-exist. Think about the phrase "there is an exception to every rule" , this rule is its own exception.
1.1.5.10.2.2. Pro: Instances of darkness \(absence of light\) do not disprove the existence of light elsewhere. Instances of cold \(absence of heat\) do not disprove the existence of heat elsewhere. God can exist while also allowing mankind the freedom to reject Him and embrace evil, which is the absence of His influence.
1.1.5.10.2.3. Con: This presupposes God had no choice in creating evil in the world. If God started with a blank slate, than this law of "opposition of all things" is his own invention, and therefore it was his choice for Evil to exist in the first place.
1.1.5.10.2.3.1. Con: The law of "opposition of all things" may be intrinsic to God's nature. If so, then God did not create this law. Instead, it is simply a reflection of the divine nature.
1.1.5.10.2.4. Con: Unless [Marcion's Theory of the Demiurge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcionism) is correct, God's existence as a good being without a corresponding evil being of equal power contradicts the notion that there must necessarily be "opposition in all things."
1.1.5.10.2.4.1. Con: No evil being is necessary to prove that God uses also ways that humans believe are, in the beginning, "bad". \(The cross, Isaac's sacrifice and so on through all the Bible...\)
1.1.5.10.2.5. Pro: Good and evil can co-exist because, in fact, they are part of the same Being. According to the Principle of Polarity of Hermetic Philosophy exposed in the [Kybalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kybalion), God and The Devil are two face of the same coin, like everything else in the Universe. In that way, not only such co-existence is possible, but it is mandatory. After all, the existence of one means necessarily the existence of the other.
1.1.5.10.2.5.1. Con: If "the existence of one means necessarily the existence of the other" then you are just opening up a whole other logical problem.  It means as long as God has existed \(forever\), the Devil has existed. It means that God and the Devil \>both\< existed "In the beginning", before the creation of the Universe.
1.1.5.10.2.5.2. Pro: There are sufficient grounds for believing that the Kybalion contains divine revelation.
1.1.5.10.2.5.3. Con: There aren't sufficient grounds for believing that the Kybalion contains divine revelation.
1.1.5.10.2.6. Pro: The existence of Satan in the Bible would indicate that evil has a place in the monotheistic God story.
1.1.5.10.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.1.5.10.2.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.10.3. Pro: Things are discernible due to what they aren't \(e.g. red is red because it is not blue, etc\); if evil did not exist, one could not know what good is. This means that one's understanding of goodness is a direct function of the amount of evil they witness. This makes the allowance of evil in the world an act of benevolence, and therefore one that God ought to make if It were to be 'omnibenevolent'.
1.1.5.10.3.1. Con: But evil in the world is so vastly manifested throughout history. Surely people would be able to understand good through a smaller contrast of evil, just as with your coulour-example, we wouldn't need to encounter more than red once, to know it's nature. An omniscient God would know the exact amount of evil required for this purpose and limit evil in the world to this amount. The problem then becomes why would God allow this much evil.
1.1.5.10.3.1.1. Con: God may have multiple uses for evil and suffering \(such as providing people with free will, developing virtues, etc.\). Thus, providing knowledge through contrast may only be one of God's many uses for evil and suffering. By itself it may not explain the extent of evil we see, but combined with other reasons the extent of evil may be warranted.
1.1.5.10.3.2. Con: The truthfulness of this statement does not influence its parent. The argument should be posited as a counter to some of the root pros.
1.1.5.10.3.3. Con: If this is true, then God would need to depend on evil in order to know himself. Yet this would make God dependent on evil, contradicting his aseity \(self-sufficiency\). Since a maximally great being must logically possess aseity, it is impossible for such a being to depend on evil. Further, God would cease to be omniscient without evil, therefore ceasing to be God.
1.1.5.10.4. Con: The truthfulness of the claim follows trivially from the premises of the root hypothesis - existence of evil is assumed and existence of good reasonably implied. The truthfulness of the claim can therefor not contribute either in the pro or con to any claim with the same conditions as the root hypothesis, including the claim's parent.
1.1.5.10.5. Pro: As a perfect being, God will create the best feasible world. The best feasible world may necessarily contain evil.
1.1.5.10.5.1. Pro: Correctly understood, God's omnipotence does not necessarily contradict the requirement that evil exist in the best feasible world.
1.1.5.10.5.1.1. Pro: Omnipotence means God can do anything \(any "thing"\). However, not all described actions are coherent, and thus not really "things". For example, God cannot create a two-sided triangle, because such a described action is incoherent. Similarly, God may not be able to create a best feasible world without evil in it, because such a described action my entail incoherent propositions.
1.1.5.10.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.1.5.10.6. Con: We can imagine a world without evil. The fact that it doesn't exist either means that it's not possible or that God is not as it is described by Christianity. However; we should not be assuming a priori that evil is necessary.
1.1.5.10.6.1. Con: I cannot imagine a world with no evil.  Even if we could set parameters for what is evil and what is not \(is death by natural causes evil?  Is pain of any kind evil?\).  What would a world with no evil look like?
1.1.5.10.7. Con: It's not true that things are discernible by what they aren't. We can discern shades of red in absence of blue.
Even if it were true, it would be a limitation that's put on us by God that designed us. That would suggest a malevolent design flaw.
1.1.5.10.8. Con: If it's necessary for God to use evil for a greater purpose then I don't think we can call God all good and omnipotent.
We can imagine a good person administering a painful cure but that's only because they have no power to use a painless cure.
An all powerful God should be able to find non evil means to achieve good goals. Therefore it's a contradiction to be all good and all powerful but doing evil.
1.1.5.10.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.1.5.10.9. Con: The conception of heaven present in many religions suggests that a world of absolute good is possible.
1.1.5.10.9.1. Con: True. However, there may also be logically necessary processes needed to bring free agents to this blissful state. For example, God may need to use evils and suffering to allow free agents to make morally-significant decisions and to develop virtues. These things may be necessary in order to develop characters sufficiently to exist in a sustainable paradise.
1.1.5.10.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.1.5.10.9.2. Con: Our experience of the world is about change and finitude, oppositions and struggle. Instead, common definitions of heaven equate it with immutability and bliss. Also, religions typically suggest that ascension to heaven requires overcoming worldly suffering and temptations. Therefore, the possibility of a world of absolute good does not preclude the existence of evil. Indeed, for many religions, heaven and the world coexist, albeit in different dimensions.
1.1.5.10.10. Pro: Evil is totally independent of God, and separate from God.  Therefore, the existence of God neither affects, causes nor precludes the existence of evil.  Likewise, evil does not cause nor preclude the existence of God.  So they are absolutely compatible, in the vacuous sense \(any functional implication of evil doesn't change the nature of good, and any functional implication of good doesn't change the nature of evil, so they coexist, and their existences are compatible\).[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth)
1.1.5.10.10.1. Con: Good and Evil are descriptions of actions and events and do not tangibly exist any more than tallness or shortness. The idea of evil has no bearing on the existence of God.
1.1.5.10.10.2. Con: Evil is not something in itself, but the negation of good. Therefore, evil depends on God to be defined.
1.1.5.10.10.3. Con: ‘Without darkness light has no meaning’. Evil is a necessity in order for God to exist and would be part of the Logos rather than ancillary to it.
1.1.5.10.10.3.1. Con: Evil does not exist in heaven, therefore a world without evil is not only possible, but already extant.
1.1.5.10.10.3.1.1. Con: In the monotheistic belief system Satan came from heaven after losing a battle with God. In this sense heaven, and therefore God himself, must be the originator of evil and by defintion evil must be part of Him.
1.1.5.10.10.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.5.10.10.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.
1.1.5.10.10.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.5.1.
1.1.5.10.10.4. Con: If God cannot affect the existence of evil, then He is not omnipotent.
1.1.6. Con: If God's greater purpose is to inflict evil in order to test faith, we should be able to do that also.
1.1.6.1. Con: This objection fails to take account of the literary genre of the Book of Job, or to explain its theological significance. For example, the Book of Job may be a parable meant to demonstrate humanity's inability to understand God's reasons for permitting suffering. If so, then we would be misusing the story if we used it as a justification for inflicting torture.
1.1.6.2. Con: In the book of Job, God did not inflict torture to test faith.  God allowed the Devil to inflict torture upon Job.  The Devil was thus responsible for the torture inflicted upon Job, not upon God.  

We can adopt God's example because we do not HAVE to step in and stand up for others and prevent them from being tortured by an evil third party.  To step in would be heroic, but to stand by is not immoral.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: If you allow harm to be done, you are also partly responsible.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: As creator, God does not have the same duties and obligations as humans do to one another. As giver of life, he has the right to take life as well, or to permit pain to occur, provided such events further a logically maximal good and are sufficiently justified \(such as developing one's character or providing insight, as in the case of Job\).
1.1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: The greatest good imaginable is one in which there is no pain. If god permits pain he is either not all powerful or not all good.
1.1.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Pain has objective evolutionary value. It is a beneficial warning that one is being harmed, and is a neurological, electrochemical phenomena that is wholly distinct from the harm that it indicates. Thus it  is in error that it is held up as implicitly bad.
1.1.6.2.1.2. Con: Responsibility does not always equate to guilt, or evil. If God is responsible for the fact that our suffering is allowed to exist, then he could fulfill his responsibility by providing a means for sin to be forgiven and suffering to be compensated for. This is the very principle of Jesus Christ's Atonement.
1.1.6.2.2. Pro: Job offers a completely different outlook, where Evil is to be expected and Good is a gift. Therefore, by the logic of the book of Job, the fact that Goodness exists is evidence of God's existence.
1.1.6.3. Con: We are able to do so. Consider when parents assert authority by saying, 'Because I said so!' This reinforces the need for the child to trust the morality of the parent
1.1.7. Con: If we take it that God inflicts \(or allows\) evil as a test and yet is our moral example, then clearly, the moral confusion that arises is indication of the non-existence of such a God.
1.1.7.1. Con: God may have sufficient reasons for permitting moral confusion. Because we lack an omniscient perspective, we have no way of knowing or even gauging the probability of whether this is the case. As such, this objection is a wash. It does nothing to raise or lower the probability of God's existence.
1.1.7.2. Con: Moral confusion could be better understood as the manifest needs for moral thought and maturity. And thus is positive.
1.1.8. Con: The idea of "wrongdoing"/"evil" varies a great deal between sects, how could a God possibly expect us to remain "good" in such confusion?
1.1.8.1. Con: It is still possible to find consensus on certain moral norms. For example, the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) was signed by nearly every country in the world, revealing that human beings have general agreement about what constitutes right and wrong \(though there may be disagreements on certain topics\).
1.1.8.2. Con: Disagreement does not mean that it is impossible to discover truth. For example, there has been much disagreement over various scientific theories. Yet certain theories have ultimately been found to be superior to others, and the scientific method has led to the acquisition of knowledge. The same may be true for morality.
1.1.8.2.1. Pro: God may have sufficient reasons for wanting us to work through moral dilemmas, rather than simply inserting the knowledge directly into us. For example, working through moral dilemmas may provide the opportunity to develop critical-thinking skills, virtues, etc. Giving humans these opportunities for growth may constitute a greater good than simply handing the knowledge to us on a platter.
1.1.8.2.1.1. Con: An omnipotent and omniscient being could also give people critical-thinking skills, virtues, and opportunities for growth without creating evil.
1.1.9. Pro: The Bible provides the answer for the existence of evil.  Regardless of whether the story is allegory or truth, the truths conveyed remain.
1.1.9.1. Con: God desires from humans to "become like their heavenly Father". Greater knowledge is not evil by itself.
1.1.9.1.1. Con: God may have had multiple intersecting desires from humans. Even if greater knowledge is not an evil in itself, it may have been an evil relative to other desires, such as obedience, patience, etc. As an example, it may not be evil for a child to eat a cookie, but it would be an evil if the child did this despite his parents telling him not to.
1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: God in Bible may have had intersecting desires from humans. But following any of these desires should not be punishable, should not be evil, otherwise God is evil. God should promote growing in virtue in some way, like by commanding "love thy mother or love thy neighbor", whatever one is more capable for, not by asking "kill your mother or kill your neighbor. God with conflicting desires is evil.
1.1.9.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.
1.1.9.1.1.1.2. Con: According to Christian theology, the data in the Bible must be interpreted correctly in order to be properly understood and applied. Not all interpretations will lead to an accurate conception of God. In fact, reading the Bible often leads to faulty understandings of God when misused. Only a Gospel and Christ-Centered interpretation will provide an accurate understanding of Christian ethics.
1.1.9.2. Con: Deception is evil. If Adam and Eve were deceived, then evil already existed when they were still innocent.
1.1.9.3. Pro: In the Bible, it says "God is love", God is not a lawmaker or a rule enforcer.  There are many forms of 'love', such as 'tough love'.
1.1.9.3.1. Con: The bible also casts god as a law maker and a rule enforcer.
1.1.9.3.1.1. Pro: Maimonides counted 613 different rules throughout the Bible. \(Thou shalt / shalt not etc.\) Such a list amounts to possibly the most conditional love one can imagine
1.1.9.3.2. Con: The "love" mentioned in John 4 is an english translation of ἀγάπη \(agape\): voluntary and unconditional love, sometimes translated as "Charity".
1.1.9.3.3. Con: God's wrath is far more prevalent. Most of the Old Testament describes Israelites in fear of their deity, appeasing him so he doesn't abandon them to their many enemies \(which they supposedly made in God's name\). God cannot be all-loving if he also smites his followers' enemies as well as his followers themselves, or abandons them in disgust for their imperfections which he himself forced them to have. He cannot be just and merciful because one is a suspension of the other.
1.1.9.3.4. Con: The Book of Numbers alone inundates the believer with rules, and Jesus is said to have told his followers to not forget "one jot nor tittle" of the Old Testament, so modern Christian Apologists have to explain their way around that one.
1.1.9.3.5. Con: Saying that "God is love" does not negate other roles that God has in the Bible, such as [judge](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+17%3A31&version=ESV), [King](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+47%3A7&version=ESV), [savior](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=titus+1%3A3&version=ESV), and [lawgiver](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+4%3A12&version=ESV).
1.1.9.4. Pro: In the Christian faith, the existence of evil is demonstration of God's patience and benevolence towards those who are evil, in giving them a chance to repent.
1.1.9.4.1. Con: It would be more ethical to provide humans with free will in tandem with a nature and ecosystem perfectly attuned for social harmony; instead of free will in tadem with a nature and ecosystem which are not easily altered to allow for consistently good behavior.
1.1.9.5. Pro: What we call evil is often \(not always\) the result of judgement and punishment of the creation defying the Creator. The punishment could be against an individual or wider even generational impact depending on the offense and God's will.
1.1.9.5.1. Con: How is it possible to know God's will? There is no direct indication of such a thing.
1.1.9.5.2. Pro: Any consideration of the Judeo-Christian 'God' must include the associated texts.  'Evil' nor 'good' are abstracts.  They are deliberate actions performed by Humans.  'Allow' is not the message of the texts.  'Permit' until Humans choose to act one way or the other then sort them out based on their 'actions' IS the message of the texts.  Then burn the evil and only allow the good to proceed.  Until you hear God speak from the sky the texts are what we have.
1.1.9.5.3. Con: Punishing a person for an offence they did not commit and had nothing to do with is evil. If God does this, He is not benevolent.
1.1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.
1.1.10. Con: It is often easy to ameliorate an evil act done for good by simply revealing the benefits of the act and asking permission. Instead we are required to blindly trust that the evil act will turn out to be good.
1.1.10.1. Con: Under the theory of social contract, human beings implicitly consent to live as part of a community merely by participating in it, which is why it is justified to create laws. Similarly, human beings may implicitly consent to experience evil and suffering by living in and benefitting from creation. Such implicit consent and accrued benefits may also give us certain obligations, such as an obligation to follow moral laws and not to commit suicide \(which would be an implicit breach of obligation\).
1.1.10.1.1. Con: Social contract works because there is the possibility to not participate, and thus consent is given. Punishing suicide removes the possibility to revoke consent.
1.1.10.1.1.1. Con: Once you have accrued benefits from being part of a society, you cannot simply begin breaking those rules \(e.g. murdering people\), and claim to invoke your right not to participate. Likewise, we have all accrued benefits from living and benefitting from creation, and so cannot then simply invoke our right not to participate by breaking the rules.
1.1.10.1.1.1.1. Con: Yes you can. In fact the punishment for breaking the rules is being no longer allowed to participate. Consent requires choice. There is no choice in existence absent suicide.
1.1.10.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A similar punishment may be the consequence of suicide.
1.1.10.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If you are punished for removing consent, then at absolute best consent is coerced.
1.1.10.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.1.1.1.
1.1.10.1.3. Con: This would revoke our freedom of choice.
1.1.10.1.4. Con: Agreeing to accept evil concedes that God makes evil an acceptable, perhaps necessary, part of this contract, which would make God complicit.
1.1.10.1.5. Con: Humans certainly implicitly agree to obey the laws but they do not agree to accept law breaking.
This argument says that we should accept evil resulting from law breaking and acts of God.
1.1.10.1.5.1. Con: Humans agree to accept that law-breaking will inevitably exist in a society with laws. They may demand justice when a law is broken and they receive a harm from it, but they still accept th possibility of law-breaking occurring.
1.1.10.1.6. Con: An entity that forces us into an evil world and forces us to accept the evil as part of a 'contract' can't be described as all good.
1.1.10.1.6.1. Con: He can remain all-good if he has sufficient reasons for allowing evil to exist in this context.
1.1.10.1.7. Con: Evil results not from the laws but from law breaking. God is supposed to be a perfect enforcer of the laws. It spears that he does not do that. That's the reason evil proliferates.
1.1.10.1.7.1. Con: God may have sufficient reasons for deferring punishment, and he may be able to sufficiently remediate those who experience harms as a result of this deferral.
1.1.10.2. Pro: An evil act committed without informed consent remains evil no matter how good the results.
1.1.10.3. Pro: Forcing us to accept evil acts without consent also goes against the argument of free will.
1.1.11. Con: The fact that God has reasons for evil is not being questioned. Rather, what is being debated is whether those reasons are evil.
1.1.11.1. Con: By "greater purpose", we mean a purpose sufficient to logically justify the co-existence of God and evil. \(for example, [developing character](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1960.512)\)
1.1.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.1.11.2. Con: If the reasons are logically sufficient, then they are not evil.
1.1.11.2.1. Con: We don't know that they are and we should not be assuming that.
1.1.11.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.2.2.1.
1.1.11.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.2.1.1.1.2.
1.1.11.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.2.1.1.1.2.
1.1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.
1.1.11.4. Con: Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga provides a creative  illustration to address the reasoning that there cannot be any good reason for evil. Many assume that if there were good reasons for the existence of evil, they would be accessible to our minds, more like St. Bernards than like no-see-ums \(an extremely small insec\) in a pup-tent, but why should that be the case? [Tim Keller shares this argument](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Nave-html/Faithpathh/keller32.html)
1.1.11.4.1. Con: One can easily imagine a universe in which evil, pain, and suffering do not exist. This is not beyond our mental faculties.
1.1.12. Pro: The existence of evil is not necessarily bad. If death gives people purpose to live a fuller life, evil could give people a reason to live better.
1.1.12.1. Pro: Yes, but it doesn't give any more value than a specific reason to live. Other concepts, like the Ancient Greeks' hysterophemia \(=to be rememberd by the next generations\) exist
1.1.12.2. Con: Is there no alternative to evil to promote goodness? Can goodness only be given to those who are suffering as a result of evil? Good actions and Goodness \(which I take to mean empathetic or altruistic behavior\) can be offered to people who do not suffer at all.  A happy person can be made happier. If I observe wealth it does not imply poverty.
1.1.12.3. Con: Forms of evil, such as terrorism, abuse and genocide, only serve to increase the amount of suffering in the world, and do not promote people to live a "fuller life".
1.1.12.4. Con: The existence of evil is, by definition, bad.
1.1.12.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.
1.1.12.5. Con: God could have created a motivation to live better in life without creating evil.
1.1.12.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.2.1.
1.1.12.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.
1.1.12.7. Pro: Without rain there's no beautiful day. Living is just like an exam, the after death is the result. So God created good and evil so God can test humans. There will be another mission for the humanity  that will depend of your life's result.
1.1.12.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.1.12.7.2. Con: This describes what God supposedly does and not that it is not evil or a good justification for it.
1.1.12.7.3. Con: Tests can be evil especially when they are rigged, with high stakes, cause tremendous pain and the results are already known.
The story of Job serves as an example. God tormented Job as a test, knowing very well that Job will pass it. God also tormented and killed people around Job, but they were merely a collateral damage, a means to an end.
God knew what torment would make Job fail, he know all our weaknesses. When God performs test he rigs them with that knowledge and foregone conclusion.
1.1.12.7.3.1. Con: Language of "testing" in Job may be a form of divine condescension--in other words, a way of communicating transcendent ideas to people with limited understanding. The larger purpose of the story may be to demonstrate that humans [lack capacity to understand the ways of God](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.11), but that this should not function as a justification for rejecting him.
1.1.12.7.3.1.1. Con: A perfect creation wouldn't include people with limited understanding of transcendent ideas. Communication of God's messages/teachings should be perfect too. Or else you may agree that God's creation is not perfect.
1.1.12.7.3.1.1.1. Con: God may have sufficient reasons for permitting a perfect creation of one type \(C1\) to be perverted by others in order to achieve a greater good, and bring about a state of affairs that is greater than C1 \(C2\).
1.1.12.7.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: For example, God could create a perfectly human-lacking world \(CLH\), but he may believe it to be a greater good to transform CLH into a creation with humans \(CWH\), even though CWH will necessarily involve humans using their agency to make bad decisions, perverting it temporarily. He may likewise believe that this temporary perversion is a greater good than the alternative of not creating such a world at all.
1.1.12.7.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.1.
1.1.12.7.3.1.2. Con: A perfect and all knowing God would know that his message might be misunderstood and would use different words to convey it. And if words were too limiting he would communicate it directly to our minds without any ambiguity.
1.1.12.7.3.1.2.1. Con: God may have sufficient reasons for not desiring to reveal certain information to humans. Since we lack an omniscient  perspective, we have no way of knowing whether these sufficient reasons exist. As such, we have no basis for denying the existence of God on the basis of God not revealing certain information to us.
1.1.12.7.3.1.2.1.1. Con: The above statement requires the existence of God. A possible conclusion of this debate could lead to a prove of God's existence or non-existence. Therefore statements that possibly lead to such a conclusion should not require any assumption about the existence of God.
1.1.12.7.3.1.2.1.2. Con: If we simply pick options that seem possible to us \(God may have sufficient reasons\) and refer to our lack of knowledge we can successfully derive almost any conclusion since we lack the knowledge to prove or disprove them.
1.1.12.7.4. Con: How can you know if there is a test at all? The experience of life is void of any suggestion of such a test. How would we know the criteria? What if in order to pass the test we needed to do over as many people as possible? Or what if the point of the test was to give up all worldly possessions and human connections such as love? How would we know we have the right religion at all, yet alone know the way to pass the test? What if I am passing the test now by not falling for a man made religion?
1.1.13. Pro: Salvation requires the existence of evil, thus God may preserve evil in order to make salvation possible.
1.1.14. Con: A God that chooses not to stop evil and instead allows it to exist for a higher purpose is not worth worshiping.
1.1.14.1. Con: The Bible explains that God is stopping evil.
1.1.14.1.1. Con: hes not doing a very good job
1.1.14.1.1.1. Con: To determine the degree to which God is succeeding in stopping evil we would need to first measure the quantity of evil vs good in the world, and then measure whether this balance is changing. We are not able to do this.
1.1.14.1.1.1.1. Pro: To determine the degree to which God is succeeding in stopping evil, we would need to define evil \(e.g. is it contingent upon malevolence? Would negligence count? Is there a continuum of evil? etc.\).
1.1.14.2. Con: A God who controls our thoughts and actions is far worse.
1.1.15. Pro: The idea that God makes use of evil is demonstrated in the Torah in the example of Job, in which God permits the Devil to inflict suffering on Job as a test.
1.1.15.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.1.15.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.15.3. Con: A supreme and omnipotent God wouldn't need outsourcing of its own power, by definition. He would be self-sufficient for any action, including infliction of suffering. "The Devil" character is redundant with a "God that finds evil convenient and puts it in his creation with misterious purposes" character. So the Devil character must be purely mythical, as well as narratives that rely on it.
1.1.15.4. Con: An omniscient God would know the result of any test a priori, so his"tests" are an illusion for the human, who has no choice at all. Such a God that inflicts suffering on humans in order to cause a specific already known consequence on human behavior/knowledge, amidst other "good" possible means for the same outcome, seems to have evil in its core.
1.1.15.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.7.3.1.
1.1.15.5. Con: The use of evil by God is not in dispute. It's whether that use makes God good is in question.
1.1.15.6. Pro: It is possible that the ultimate goal God wishes people to reach comes from the process and not from specific rules. Challenges bring strength and endurance which may be required in the next reality.
1.1.16. Pro: Evil exists as a tool for a monotheistic God's plan and not as sign of absence of monotheistic God.  There is no progress without struggle.  Without evil, man would have no possibility for growth.
1.1.17. Pro: Paradise is the only perfect creation and this world is imperfect. Evils were permitted as a necessity to challenge human creations to choose to do good and be deserving of paradise.
1.1.18. Pro: God is temporarily tolerating evil as a consequence of the assertion that we would be better off without him. Once it is clear to everyone that this was not true, God will use his omnipotence to right the consequences and remove evil completely.
1.1.18.1. Con: A god that would stand by and allow genocide, war, and rape just so that humanity could learn to "depend on him" is the epitome of evil.
1.1.18.2. Con: This is not the behaviour of a good being. A good being would not consider "people asserting that they are better off without God" to be more morally important than the lives and suffering of billions of people.
1.1.18.3. Con: If a god were omnipotent it would not need to tolerate evil in the first place, as it is all powerful. It would be able to make its necessity apparent without evil. Thus the only reason a god would allow evil is to cause suffering, which contradicts such a gods omnibenevolence. Therefore such a god is paradoxical by nature.
1.1.19. Pro: All evil is either just or applied justice since all belongs to God. Since all things belong to God, he cannot be unjust in his use of anything.
1.1.20. Con: If God is all knowing, he would know how to create said greater purpose without evil.
1.1.20.1. Con: It may be impossible to create the greater purpose without evil.
1.1.21. Pro: The existence of failure is often considered the best way to learn success. The same can be said for evil and good, respectively.
1.1.21.1. Con: If a god were omniscient there would be no need for such a biological response such as learning from experience. This is because such a god would already know everything and thus be unable to make mistakes. Even if it were possible for such a god to make mistakes it would gain no new experience from doing so as it is again already all knowing. Thus voiding the necessity of such things.
1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.
1.3. Con: Humans are limited in their capacity to conceptualize God, and thus are incapable of accurately judging the relationship between evil and a divine being.
1.3.1. Pro: It may be that it is better to have a world containing what humans regard as evil, than it would be to have one without. It may also be that humans are simply incapable of understanding why that is, while a superior being can. In the same way that children may regard it as evil that their parents don’t allow them to play in the traffic.
1.3.1.1. Con: But if humans can't know what is good or evil, does this not mean that there is no morality? That it is pointless to try and do good?
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Humans can know : That's why God sends messengers and prophets with religion and rules; good and evil become what God has declared as good/evil for humans. Otherwise there'd be no actual sense of morality, and humans would have to make rules on their own: imperfect and flawed
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: But if humans are imperfect and flawed, how can you know that a prophet is actually a prophet, and that those rules actually come from god?
1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It's only natural to ask prophets for proof, and there were no prophet without proofs\(because their purpose is to spread God's message, he wouldn't send them without proofs\). They are but humans who walk in markets and eat food. Yet they are different in terms of committing sins: they\(by the will of God\) don't; it's improper for a prophet of God to disobey him. One wouldn't trust messengers if they themselves did the opposite of what they are preaching to.
1.3.1.2. Pro: In multiple religions God pushes evil\(a hurtful deed for his creations\) as a punishment: for a rule that they've broken, or a test: if they pass they're hugely rewarded, if they fail it's up to him to decide what should follow. In Islam for example: Life is a mere test: a harsh test for humans, full of evil and good, but if one passes they go to the perfect heavens as a reward. So why did God create this test? He didn't answer that question, however he said it's never unjust.
1.3.1.3. Pro: The Book of Job confronts the mystery of Evil by having the deity answer Job's questions in this manner: humanity is in no position to see all ends, and cannot therefore see the points and purposes in anything that happens at all.

If you say "I can't see why a truly benevolent God would allow X," the deity of Job will quite agree with you. If the answer does not satisfy you, that too is to be expected.

The "Job Defense" is impossible to circumvent. No deity worth its salt is comprehensible.
1.3.1.4. Con: Is a world that is perceived as evil by its inhabitants, not just an evil world? Is the dispair of being confined to an evil world not a form of suffering in itself? An omnipotent and benevolent deity would create a world that is just in the eyes of humans.
1.3.1.5. Con: It might be better but we can't assume that without good evidence.
We can equally assume that the world is worse with evil than without it, which makes a much better intuitive sense.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: So long as it is possible, then we cannot allege that God and the existence of evil are logically incompatible. Instead, the question would turn on probability judgments. Yet because we lack an omniscient perspective, it would be difficult \(if not impossible\) to determine the plausibility of the issue. Thus, this objection lacks teeth--it makes no difference one way or the other.
1.3.1.5.1.1. Con: God himself proved it's possible by creating heaven.
1.3.1.5.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.
1.3.1.5.1.1.2. Con: The existence of heaven may still logically entail the existence of evil and suffering at some other point in time \(future, present, past\) or in a different plane of existence \(such as earth or hell\).
1.3.2. Pro: We cannot fully understand God's plan, but He has a plan that's greater than any of us can imagine.  Evil is a part of it.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Part of that plan can, quite possibly be that a loving god is non-interventionist.  Beyond am unfolding creation, a loving god may offer choice as a greater good--however stupidly humans exercise it.
1.3.2.2. Pro: "My son, do not scorn correction from the Lord, do not resent his training, \[...\] Of course, any discipline is at the time a matter for grief, not joy; but later, in those who have undergone it, it bears fruit in peace and uprightness." \(Letter to the Hebrews 12,5.11\)
1.3.3. Con: The traditional concept of God is clearly defined by the three qualities all-mighty, all-loving and all-knowing. As a result of these characteristics, God is not difficult to conceive of.
1.3.3.1. Con: We often use words without knowing all their entailments. For example, I can refer to the "Orion Nebula" without knowing everything about the nebula. Likewise, we may understand "good" in a mundane sense but lack an understanding of all its entailments when applied to a divine being.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: You can't actually say that mankind wouldn't understand the concept of good and bad, because we ourselves crafted that concept.
Besides this, affirming that god still being perfectly good even with all the problems that exist in the world just because "we don't know what is good or not, GOD does" is a bit problematic. Since even if this claim is right, God himself could pretty much end that problem making us as wise as him. Not treating us as lambs...
1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: This argument commits the question-begging fallacy, as it assumes the truth of what it seeks to prove--i.e. that good and evil are merely human constructs. If God exists, then good and evil stem from ontological realities beyond ourselves, and are not merely human constructs.
1.3.3.1.1.2. Con: This con misrepresents my argument. Humans do have an understanding of good, we just don't understand all of its entailments when applied to a divine being, much as we don't know everything about the Orion Nebula, even though we know certain things about it.
1.3.3.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.12.7.3.1.2.1.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.7.3.1.2.1.
1.3.3.1.3. Con: the words used describing heaven to us were supposedly sent to us by God himself so we should assume that they are true and accurate.
1.3.3.1.3.1. Con: As St. Paul says, "We see through a glass darkly." God may have sufficient reasons for concealing certain truths from is, or only revealing them in part. The language of heaven in scripture is vague and highly symbolic for this reason.
1.3.3.1.3.1.1. Con: The scriptures do not state that God conceals the truth from us for a good reason. Therefore this should not be assumed without good evidence.
1.3.3.1.3.1.1.1. Con: In fact, the scriptures frequently allude to this concept, which is why it is the consensus of Judeo-Christian theologians. For example, "The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law."
1.3.3.1.3.1.2. Con: Concealing the truth, while saying that the revelations are the ultimate truth, is tantamount to lying. Which would make God a deceiving evil being.
1.3.3.1.3.1.2.1. Con: The Judeo-Christian religion does not claim to reveal comprehensive truth in the sense of explaining all things with absolute precision. It only claims to reveal truth sufficient to bring human beings into a salvic relationship with God. In fact, the Judeo-Christian religion frequently admits to mystery, and admits that God does not reveal everything to human beings.
1.3.3.1.4. Con: In this case the "good" is not applied to a divine being but to living conditions that we can experience first hand.
1.3.3.1.4.1. Con: Such a semantic rule would make it impossible to apply language to anything, due to the Kantian gap between the phenomenal and noumenal. \(to put it another way: we do not experience any substances first-hand. Even objects we see with our eyes come to us indirectly via photons, which are translated via our brain, which we count on only due to its functional utility\).
1.3.3.1.4.1.1. Con: The statement is not about semantic rules but a clarification what is being discussed in the parent claim. It is living conditions not God.
1.3.3.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The statement contains an implicit semantic rule, demanding that we only apply words to things we can experience "first-hand". The Kantian gap shows that such a semantic rule would be untenable.
1.3.3.1.5. Con: Whatever limited knowledge we have about the goodness of this world vs heaven we can all agree that heaven is better than this world. Therefore God purposefully tolerates evil while having the ability to eliminate it to the level it is in heaven. 
No good and compassionate being would do that.
1.3.3.1.5.1. Con: Such a being would do so if he had sufficient reasons. For example, it may be logically necessary for God to allow evil in order to achieve a [greater good](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.1113).
1.3.3.1.5.1.1. Con: God's reasons are not in question. Criminal have reasons too to do evil to achieve a greater good - as they see it.
The end should not justify the means especially for all powerful being.
1.3.3.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Criminals have reasons, but they do not have sufficient reasons. Since God has an omniscient perspective, he would know in ultimate fact whether a particular act leads to a greater good. This distinguishes him from fallible human beings, who cannot make such determinations with any accuracy due to the butterfly-effect and other insurmountable obstacles.
1.3.3.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The ends can never logically justify the means with omnipotence. Omnipotence means no means are ever necessary.
1.3.3.1.6. Con: The above statement relies on the existence of God by describing a sense of good applied to a divine being. If it turns out through this debate that the existence of God is incompatible with the existence of evil, concluding that there is no such god, the above statement will rely on a divine being whos existence has been disproven. Thus the above statement only has impact on the debate if the outcome of the debate does not question or disprove the existence of God.
1.3.4. Con: If we lack knowledge about God at even this fundamental and generally agreed level then any discussion about God is futile.
We have to assume that we do know enough to make discussion possible.
1.3.4.1. Con: To be able to conceptualise god is one thing, to determine gods motivations and intentions in regards to human actions would be futile.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Human beings have demonstrated that, in principle, they have the ability to deeply understand complex patterns, and the limits to this capacity as it stands in principle are not clear, therefore it is not clear that we lack the capacity to conceptualize and judge the virtue and coherency of God's possible motives etc regarding humans as they relate to the claims made by religions on his behalf about his character, capacities, and motives.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: Given that theists suppose _themselves_ capable of understanding God's motives, as evidenced by the many ways in which they elaborate on God's words in order to apply them in their own lives, and defend them to non-believers, it is inconsistent to claim that human beings broadly lack the capacity to "determine gods motivations and intentions in regards to human actions".
1.3.4.1.3. Con: As God has purportedly revealed his "motivations and intentions in regards to human actions" via one holy book or another, we can assume that God himself believes we have some as yet unknown degree of ability to comprehend his "motivations and intentions in regards to human actions"
1.3.4.1.4. Con: Given that God has purportedly revealed his "motivations and intentions in regards to human actions" via one holy book or another, and we have access to the world he created generally, with many of the effects of his decrees laid bare, we have the means with which to judge the coherency and justice of his "motivations and intentions" as revealed by religions.
1.3.4.2. Con: God can easily by relatable without being understandable, as are most humans on many levels. Fundamental aspects of identity are harder to understand than directly evident traits and actions, not easier.
1.3.5. Pro: Our idea of what we define as evil might be a limited vision of a bigger plan in which evil is a  necessary element to its realization. "My son, do not scorn correction from the Lord, do not resent his training, \[...\] Of course, any discipline is at the time a matter for grief, not joy; but later, in those who have undergone it, it bears fruit in peace and uprightness." \(Letter to the Hebrews 12,5.11\)
1.3.5.1. Con: Since God is omnipotent, it can never be the case that evil is a necessary instrumental part of reaching a particular goal, since God could simply will the fulfillment of that goal without creating any evil.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: God's omnipotence is typically defined as being able to do anything that is logically possible, and some goals may not be logically possible to achieve without evil.
1.3.6. Pro: Religious beliefs like God and evil are based on faith, which is the belief in an idea or concept despite there being no actual evidence of its existence. The point of faith is the practice of belief, not the belief itself. So the practice of faith is served by believing in either one, or both.
1.3.6.1. Con: Evil is not a belief, but experience. God is also an experience, a subjective one. It is irrelevant if concepts exist in reality or not, the issue here is consistency of ideas, of a theology in this case.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: That something is perceived as evil is a value judgement on an experience, not the experience itself. Not everyone has the same value judgement of what is evil.
1.3.6.2. Con: The point of faith is finding the truth, not the practice of belief!
Practice of faith is served by experience.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: Faith is the act of believing something to be a certain way, where there is no evidence of the thing being believed. Faith is always a construct of the mind.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Con: Faith is acting as though God is trustworthy, irrespective of one's level of certainty that this is the case. 

I have faith in my wife, without any knowledge as to her true thoughts and motivations.
1.3.6.3. Con: Belief in God is not necessarily a religious belief. Deists, for example, believe that reason points to a divine being, but they do not follow any particular revealed religion.
1.3.6.4. Con: Faith does not preclude reason. Certain religious systems may involve multiple warrants or "grounds" for belief, faith only being one of them.
1.3.6.4.1. Con: Faith does not preclude reason, but it could override reason in certain instances, like \(perhaps\) this one.
1.3.6.5. Pro: The idea of an all-powerful being is so difficult to comprehend, and so alien to traditional human understandings, that faith is the best way to approach issues pertaining to God.
1.3.6.6. Pro: The epistemological starting point of the claim is the fundamental problem of the argument. To poise the question as so is to start the inquiry from my own point of view. My personal experience thus becomes the epistemological reference point. Making that first move already says that we do not believe in God because we have already moved him from the starting point of knowing. To thus ask the question of suffering in light of God as the foundation of epistemology leads us down another road.
1.3.6.6.1. Con: This claim fails to take account of the possibility of dual-warrants for theistic belief. Belief in God may be a properly basic belief \(or epistemological starting point\), but that doesn't preclude alternate warrants for showing his existence is plausible, for example through the use of shared a priori assumptions \(like the laws of logic\), which opposing parties agree to assume for the purpose of dialogue.
1.3.7. Pro: It is unreasonable for us to expect to understand God's purposes \(as we have tiny, finite minds compared to the infinite mind of God\),therefore it is unreasonable to precondition our belief in God upon our first understanding God's purposes.
1.3.7.1. Pro: One is assuming that we understand who, or what, God is. As mere humans do we have the capacity to understand something so huge and all-encompassing? Does a small child understand why it's parent says 'no'? If we are discussing a Christian God, then we are but children - and children do not understand what their parent does all the time. Saying that God would not let such and such a thing happen if 'he' were a good God, is naive.
1.3.7.2. Pro: Humans try to fit God into a box of their finite understanding. We try to imagine why God would do this or allow that.  We would be foolish to use an Atari 2600 for quantum computing.  Yet we use our limited minds to fathom what a limitless God must be thinking.
1.3.8. Pro: If you propose a deity that is capable of creating a world \(especially one without evil\), than that deity would have to be so 'different' \(for lack of a better word\) than anything we know that we'd also have to take into account that the ground for the very existence of evil could \(or should\) go beyond our comprehension.
1.3.8.1. Pro: Our vision of reality is a limited one and not an absolute like God's one. What we may perceive as evil, could be part of a greater plan that ultimately leads to love. "Of course, any discipline is at the time a matter for grief, not joy; but later, in those who have undergone it, it bears fruit in peace and uprightness." \(Epistle to the Hebrews 12,11\)
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.3.8.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.3.8.1.3. Pro: Judaism claims that all things, even the ones that seems bad for us, happens with the purpose of bringing goodness.
1.3.8.1.4. Con: This is a means to an end argument, and cannot possibly apply to an omnipotent being.  Such a being has no use for means, he simply creates the end.  Means are gratuitous.
1.3.8.1.4.1. Con: The means is for us, not for God. We are the ones needing to learn and having our character shaped. "Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything." James 1.2-4
1.3.8.1.4.1.1. Con: This doesn't properly refute the parent. God could, and reasonably should, have created us with our character already shaped.
1.3.8.1.4.1.1.1. Con: With our highly insufficient knowledge, we are completely incapable of dictating what a holy, infinite god should and should not do.
1.3.8.1.5. Con: If evil is part of "God's plan" then he is not worthy of being worshiped.
1.3.8.1.5.1. Con: According to monotheistic religions, evil exists specifically because humans chose to reject God's plan and refused to worship Him. "For although they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but they became futile in their thinking and darkened in their foolish hearts." Romans 1.22
1.3.9. Con: God as traditionally conceived has to be good and just in a way that is meaningful to people. If God is good and just but in some way that we are simply incapable of understanding, he is not God as traditionally conceived.
1.3.9.1. Con: Traditional conceptions of God often present him/her as inscrutable. This is clear, for example, from the Bible, Romans 11:33: "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!" \(KJV\).
1.3.9.1.1. Con: If God is good but inscrutable, then 'good' means nothing beyond 'whatever God is'. Regardless of what the scriptures say, for the notion of 'good' to remain meaningful, God has to be somewhat open to human appraisal.
1.3.9.1.1.1. Con: Inscrutability may exist in degrees. Just as we only see a small segment of the light spectrum, so also we may only have the cognitive apparatuses to perceive a small portion of the moral law \(via conscience\). Our conscience may provide sufficient awareness to judge moral acts on a horizontal axis \(e.g. between humans\), but not on a vertical axis \(e.g. between humans and a divine being\).
1.3.9.1.1.1.1. Con: If humans do not have sufficient awareness to judge moral acts by God then humans cannot say whether God is good or evil. This is incompatible with a traditional view of God in which God is known to be good.
1.3.9.2. Con: God might be good in ways that are meaningful to people, but without those people consciously recognising the existence of that meaning.
1.3.9.3. Con: Human beings can be good and just without that quality being understood by those it helps, the same can easily be true for god.
1.3.10. Con: If by "conceptualize God" you mean establish god as concept, clearly we are fully able to do this.  The concept of god does exists in human thinking. If the thesis said "understand God completely" it would be more logical.
1.3.10.1. Con: By "conceptualize god" the claim clearly means to be able to understand the motives of God fully enough to establish casual relationships between his actions and his moral qualities. Our ability to do this is clearly limited.
1.3.11. Pro: God \(as recognized by the three main monotheistic religions\) is a being of an incomprehensible nature. To claim knowledge of It having limitations, and all the more so, knowledge of what Its capabilities or limitations may be \(again, assuming one knows that there are any\) would be foolish
1.3.11.1. Con: God has revealed self imposed limitation in all three religions. The key aspect is the connection between God's character and his actions, not limitations on potential action.
1.3.12. Con: 'limited' suggests that we can do some conceptualising. One is more inclined to believe that any conceptualising of God is utterly erroneous and false. Those who tell of how incapable our minds are of grasping God are often the first to then tell us of his character and his desires in quite graspable terms. He only becomes ungraspable when they are asked difficult questions.
1.3.12.1. Con: The same is true of human beings. The more difficult the question about our nature, the more difficult the facts are to conceptualize. This is natural, not a figment of religious thought
1.3.13. Pro: Our concepts of power, knowledge and divinity are finite in nature. When we predicate them of God, however, we are predicating them of an infinite being. The relationship between a finite concept and an infinite concept is at best an analogical one. Thus, it may be that what seems to be evil from our limited, finite perspective is in fact, good from an infinite perspective.
1.3.13.1. Con: While elements of an analogical relationship might be unknown, they should not be flat out contradictory.
1.3.13.2. Con: This argument simply attempts to void the word 'good' of any meaning when it is used of God. It's like saying "my car is yellow, but yellow  in a sense that is ineffable and completely different from the usual meaning". 

I speak ordinary English, and the words of my language have conventional meanings. I will call no god "good" who is not what I mean by that word when I use it of a man.
1.3.13.2.1. Con: Conversely, if humans are limited in their comprehension of "Goodness," that implies that there is a higher standard for the word than "what I mean when I use it," which is rather subjective
1.3.13.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.3.13.2.3. Con: Arguably, our ordinary concept of "good" is defined without reference to any particular things which are good. If this were true, then we could use our ordinary concept of "good" and still argue that we cannot know exactly what is good and therefore cannot accurately conceptualize the relationship between God and good things.
1.3.13.2.3.1. Pro: Our ordinary concept of "good" could be intuitively defined as "things which we have moral reason to bring about." This is a definition which is totally neutral with respect to what things actually instantiate the property of good-ness.
1.3.13.2.3.1.1. Pro: If the good is "things that we have moral reason to bring about", then to be a good person means to will and act to bring about the good. God is a person who wills and acts, and so this meaning of "to be a good person" is fully applicable to him, and the notion that "good" means something different when applied to god is wrong.
1.3.13.3. Con: This implies that there may in fact be no evil at all. Very few theists would accept this premise.
1.3.13.4. Con: It is unclear what it means for a being to "be infinite," or how it might be the case that evil acts are good from an "infinite perspective."
1.3.13.4.1. Con: While it might be unclear what is meant by infinitude, the concept needs to only possibly have an unambiguous meaning to leave open the possibility that we have inaccurately judged the relationship between God and evil.
1.3.13.4.1.1. Con: Our inability to conceptualize infinitude unambiguously gives us good inductive grounds to suspect that there is no unambiguous conception of infinitude conceived as the predicate of a divine being.
1.3.13.4.1.1.1. Con: Our inability to conceptualize something need not be evidence that it does not exist. For example, we cannot coherently conceptualize the workings of quantum mechanics.
1.3.14. Pro: Assuming God is omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent, then, recognizing that I am not any of those, I must conclude that I cannot possibly understand His purpose, and cannot know what is evil to Him.  It may seem evil to me, but I can't understand what it means to Him.  I cannot know that evil exists, or that it doesn't.
1.3.15. Con: It would be impossible for humans to ever know if our conception of God were limited unless someone with an accurate conception informed us. Without the existence of such a person, claims that our conception is limited are merely guesses.
1.3.15.1. Con: It is possible to know that our understanding of a certain area is limited, without having a perfect understanding of that area to compare ourselves with. For example, we know that we don't know many things about quantum mechanics, despite the fact that no one does know those things.
1.3.15.2. Con: In Christianity, this person is Jesus. [Colossians 1:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A15&version=NLT) [John 14:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14%3A6-7&version=NLT)
1.3.15.3. Con: [Anselm's Ontological argument](https://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/puc/phi203/ontological.html) characterized God as that which no greater being can be conceived. In this way, it is not paradoxical to point to a thing beyond our capacity of conception.
1.3.15.3.1. Pro: [Anselm's 2nd premise](https://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/puc/phi203/ontological.html) is that,  it is not incoherent for us to identify God in this way, as we can conceive of greatness and of a being so great that it is beyond our comprehension.
1.3.15.4. Con: Descartes argued in the [Meditations](http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/meditations/section10/) that one of the few things that can be known is that God exists.
1.3.16. Pro: A volcanic eruption can be seen as a horrible disaster, yet it will also create fertile land that new life will spring out from; an example of how good and evil depends on the human perspective.
1.3.16.1. Pro: Man is not fit to judge evil, and many monotheistic religions explicitly or implicitly state this. The infinite and unknowable bounds of time and creation mean that evil from a mortal perspective is meaningless, ie, what appears evil to us might not be evil in the scope of the universe and all possible future events.
1.3.17. Con: Without the ability to judge the relationship between God and evil, we cannot say that it is impossible, or even unlikely, that God regards salvation and honesty as evil. Thus, Christians have no basis for believing that they are saved, or that God would not lie about them being saved.
1.3.18. Con: In the Judeo-Christian tradition, the words "good" and "evil" are used to describe God and what he desires or dislikes. Therefore, it is safe to assume that divine texts are referring to those concepts as they would be understood by humans, otherwise a different word would have been used.
1.3.18.1. Con: The ability to understand the concepts of good and evil does not imply the ability to understand their relationship to the nature of God. I.E. just because we understand evil in this world, doesn't mean we understand its eternal significance
1.3.19. Con: Human limitations are exactly why God gives dogma. Original idea of theology is that dogma means divinely revealed truth. If dogma is inconsistent, it is not human, but divine fault. And if God makes such mistakes, maybe there is no God.
1.3.19.1. Con: Apparent inconsistencies in dogma may stem from human errors in understanding, or in approaching the dogmas incorrectly. Such confusions are evils, and God may have good reasons for permitting these confusions.
1.3.20. Con: This claim says nothing about the nature of God, and only posits that humans have a limited perspective. There is a fact of the matter whether God is compatible with the existence of evil, or God is not compatible with the existence of evil, and this is not contingent upon whether humans can conceptualize this fact.
1.3.20.1. Con: It is exactly our conceptualization of evil, and of ultimate goodness, which leads to the belief that they may be irreconcilable.
1.4. Pro: Evil exists in the world.
1.4.1. Con: Evil is separate from the creator and results from creations after they are created
1.4.1.1. Con: The Creation of an omniscient and omnipotent God, after it's created, remains in "his" control by definition. The time dimension is part of the world \(God's creation\), so the consequences to the creation as time goes by are part of the creation itself. There can be no separation. If evil exists, it must be part of such a God's plan.
1.4.1.2. Con: Even if the creator was uncertain about the future, he must have been aware that evil would likely arise from his creation. Creation itself then qualifies as an act of evil.
1.4.1.3. Con: There are creations that can and do cause harm \(and thus evil\), because of their nature, e.g. predatory animals.
1.4.2. Pro: Needless pain and suffering is commonly inflicted upon living beings presently.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Pain and suffering is inflicted on living beings by other living beings in this world.
1.4.2.2. Pro: People are dying from a Hurricane in the Caribbean now.  If there were a God, God did that, and that's Evil.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: While it may be true that human activity exacerbate certain natural phenomena like hurricanes, by and large these activities still lie outside of human control.
1.4.2.3. Pro: [Factory farms](http://www.rollingstone.com/feature/belly-beast-meat-factory-farms-animal-activists) routinely cause needless suffering to a variety of animals.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: We really don't know what pain is like for an animal that is not self-aware. An animal can physically feel pain but it may not be self-aware enough to relate it to a human being feeling pain.
1.4.2.3.2. Con: [Factory farming is essential to feed the world](http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/ovic/ViewpointsDetailsPage/ViewpointsDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&prodId=OVIC&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Viewpoints&dviSelectedPage=&limiter=&currPage=&disableHighlighting=&displayGroups=&sortBy=&zid=&search_within_results=&p=OVIC&action=e&catId=&activityType=&scanId=&documentId=GALE%7CEJ3010701234&source=Bookmark&u=umd_um&jsid=10495f77d5c6f6f2f196be35b4d23bb9), and thus the suffering is not needless.
1.4.2.3.2.1. Pro: The article continues, "Factory farming" is just the name for the efficient large scale production of meat.
1.4.2.4. Pro: Torture is used as an interrogation technique in [many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_torture_since_1948).
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: The [United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/us/politics/guantanamo-bay-abd-al-rahim-al-nashiri.html?_r=0) tortures prisoners at the facility at Guantanamo Bay.
1.4.2.4.2. Con: [Physical torture of prisoners is an acceptable interrogation tool.](https://www.kialo.com/is-it-okay-to-physically-torture-prisoners-10378/)
1.4.2.4.3. Con: This does not negate the possibility that evil only exists as the privation of good.
1.4.2.4.4. Con: Many believe these tactics to be justified if it protects the many
1.4.2.5. Con: You would have to be omniscient to know that pain and suffering are needless.
1.4.2.6. Pro: Evil is inflicting unwanted or unnecessary pain, injury, or suffering in another human being.
1.4.2.6.1. Con: Our very categorizations of good and evil presuppose the existence of an absolute moral standard. For even if we suppose suffering and pain to be the only forms of evil, we must first assume that there is something wrong with suffering. Without God, all is one, and good and evil become non sequiturs.
1.4.2.6.2. Con: "Unnecessary pain" requires an omnipotent understanding of what is ultimately necessary, thus only possible in the presence of an omnipotent being.
1.4.2.6.2.1. Con: There is a difference between logical necessity, which may require an omniscient perspective, and the necessary restrictions imposed by one's composition.
1.4.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: It is not logically [necessary](http://branemrys.blogspot.com/2005/09/four-kinds-of-necessity.html) for an organism to eat, but eating is vital for its survival.
1.4.2.6.3. Con: If this "evil" is subjective, then this argument only prove the existence of things that some people subjectively do not approve of.
1.4.2.6.4. Con: If this "evil" is objective, it requires an objective moral arbiter, which is one thing that some might call a god.
1.4.2.6.4.1. Con: Judges can be objective moral arbiters, and they aren't gods.
1.4.2.6.4.2. Con: There are acceptable definitions of evil that do not require an absolute or objective arbiter.
1.4.2.6.5. Pro: This is a commonly held image of what evil means and even as a social construct, benefits the many who do not act this way over the few who do
1.4.2.7. Con: While pain and suffering might seem needless from our perspective, we might discover that there are reasons for them.
1.4.2.7.1. Con: All pain and suffering happens for some reason or another, and even so it can be needless. Stubbing one's toe results from having corners in your home while moving around with toes, but there's no reason to assume that any given stubbed toe must be this way.
1.4.2.7.2. Con: Since God is omnipotent, any goals which pain might be used for instrumentally could simply be accomplished directly by God. So there should be no "hidden purposes" to pain.
1.4.2.7.2.1. Con: God cannot achieve certain goals without the creation of pain if the experience of pain is partially constitutive of those goals. For example, God cannot make someone bravely overcome pain without causing them pain.
1.4.2.8. Pro: Some innocent children are born with diseases that cause horrific suffering. It does not make sense that a loving, just, and powerful God would allow that in His creation.
1.4.2.8.1. Con: The existence of suffering is not incompatible with love or justice. Suffering is an inherent part of change and growth, which a loving God would want for us.
1.4.2.8.2. Con: Classical ideals of god do not make claims that suffering would not naturally arise from chance
1.4.2.8.2.1. Con: A world in which suffering did not randomly happen is prima facie better than a world in which suffering randomly happens. Creating such a world would be within the capacity of an omnipotent God.
1.4.2.8.3. Con: Evil is generally perceived not as a less that ideal random occurence, but a choice to inflict physical or emotional damage.
1.4.2.8.4. Pro: Supports the claim that god is not all loving and/or all powerful
1.4.3. Pro: Given a universe that includes evil and other forms of suffering, it is more plausible to imagine that there is no creator than that there is a good creator.
1.4.3.1. Con: If the universe were the product of randomness \(or created by a callous being\), then humanity would not have been able to conceive of the idea of a supremely benevolent creator in the face of such evil and pain.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: I'm sure we can all agree that unicorns, elves, ninja turtles, Harry Potter, etc..... do not exist, but are merely a story told without the need of evidence or facts. Any beliefs in a god can be held to the same standards. Hence, we do not need a god to imagine the idea of a god. Gods are just a simple explanation of the unknown for simple minded people.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: The concept of God is an extension of many existing concepts/forms, simply pushed to the infinite desirable limit of comprehension. The concept of God is an extrapolation of existing knowledge, just as our perception of the future is. Neither is by necessity accurate.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: The teleological impulse, or desire for "the good", or "purpose" or "meaning", is an indication of a transcendent locus. It is implausible that such desires would be a result of natural selection, since they serve no coherent biological purpose.
1.4.3.1.3. Pro: There does not need to be a God for humans to have conceived of God. Humans can conceive of all manner of things that are not real.
1.4.3.2. Con: A lack of omnipotence is as plausible as no God at all, given the starting point of this discussion.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: There is a coherence of being that could be what is referred to in gnostic scripture.  In the Nag-Hammadi scrolls there is a phrase, "you cannot see the Father but, you can see His light in my face."  This coherence is ostensibly inactive; apparently we can move from it but, such movement is unstable an requires more energy: I mean; we are free to lie, there is no active, immediate correction; the potency of the coherence requirement comes in the fullness of time; potency, not omnipotence.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: A non-omnipotent God is not a god "as traditionally conceived in monotheist religions", which is how the discussion is framed.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Con: The 'pro' my 'con' is responding to claims no god is more plausible.  The discussion was not framed as either omnipotence or nothing; it's framed as traditional or not.
1.4.3.3. Con: The existence of God doesn't depend upon verifiable evidence, as it is a matter of faith.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: Accepting this kind of reasoning would make the discussion in itself meaningless.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: Faith should not be absurd, but logical. It must not violate reason.
1.4.3.4. Con: Something being plausible or easier to imagine is not a demonstration nor a source of knowledge.
1.4.3.5. Con: Creators of educational environments, games, and media often include suffering in their creations in order to achieve an effect, regardless of how good or evil they might otherwise be.
1.4.3.6. Con: Plausibility is a concept of statistical reasoning, appropriate to working out discrete events, but inappropriate when applied to a singular event like the creation of the universe.
1.4.3.7. Pro: Bayesian reasoning supports the notion that a world that includes evil and other forms of suffering is most likely not created by an intelligent, benevolent creator.
1.4.3.7.1. Con: As death, war, and disease diminish, the idea of a benevolent Creator becomes more plausible.
1.4.3.7.1.1. Con: History shows there is not such thing as a linear line in direction of progress and regression of death, war and disease \(From black plague to spanish flu to ebola, mankind lived through different times of disease and of alternance of peace and war\).
1.4.3.7.1.2. Con: Death, war, and disease are not diminishing.
1.4.3.7.1.3. Pro: Acts of altruism, often in times of great need, are examples of Good winning out over Evil.
1.4.3.7.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.6.3.
1.4.3.7.1.5. Con: Death and disease are necessary and evolutionary plausible and no proof or rebut of god. There simply is more of these, the more population there is. War on the other side is organised murder. It shows the worst mankind is able to - and it definitely isn't declining.
1.4.3.7.1.6. Con: Death, war, and disease diminish as a result of human, rather than divine, intervention.  Thus, human, rather than divine, benevolence is a more plausible explanation.
1.4.3.7.1.7. Con: According to some biblical prophecies, the "endtimes" should be preceded by more war, death and diseases - not less ; making the idea of the biblical God less plausible if mortality and wars diminish - not more.
1.4.3.7.1.7.1. Con: Whether or not increased calamity is consistent with Biblical claims, it is inconsistent with the notion of a God who is all powerful and all good.
1.4.3.7.2. Con: The definition of a "good" creator relies on the human conception of goodness. "Good", and for the same reason, "Evil", being human categorizations, cannot apply to God.
1.4.3.7.3. Con: An intelligent, good creator is restricted to universes which are on balance good. The set of universes without such a restriction is far larger. Since we observe our world is on balance good, Bayesian reasoning supports the existence of an intelligent, good creator.
1.4.3.8. Con: There are too many variables that we don't know to weigh out the plausibility of no creator versus a good creator. It is entirely possible that these variables, if fully known, would suggest that the world, even with all its suffering, makes more sense with a omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator than with no creator.
1.4.3.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.
1.4.3.8.2. Pro: The analogy between God and a physician is relevant here. A physician may prescribe treatments which do seem worse than doing nothing but which ultimately prove to be far more beneficial than doing nothing.
1.4.3.9. Con: Findings of [Quantum mechanics](http://quantumenigma.com/nutshell/notable-quotes-on-quantum-physics/) can be interpreted as consciousness being fundamental, it seems that consciousness determines matter, rather than the other way around. So it is more plausible to assume that there is a creator, a universal consciousness. Since human apologetic response is not yet capable to address it properly, thus the problem of evil.
1.4.3.9.1. Con: If it were true that consciousness caused the collapse of the waveform in quantum mechanics, then the existence of an omniscient consciousness  observing everything would collapse all quantum wave functions before the scientist began, leaving no room for the scientist's measurement to collapse the waveform.
1.4.4. Pro: History is replete with examples of excessive evil.
1.4.4.1. Con: Without an omniscient perspective, it is impossible to determine whether a given amount of evil is excessive.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: It may be impossible to determine with certainty whether a given quantity of evil is excessive, but we can at least make a probable judgement that horrific acts of war are most likely examples of excessive evil.
1.4.4.2. Con: It depends who you ask, “The greatest happiness is to vanquish your enemies, to chase them before you, to rob them of their wealth, to see those dear to them bathed in tears, to clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters.” 
― Genghis Khan
1.4.4.3. Con: Each generation of each culture has different standards by which is judges the morality of a given action. Things that are acceptable in today's America would have been reprehensible to the pilgrims and vice versa.
1.4.4.4. Pro: Any amount of evil is excessive.
1.4.4.5. Pro: War exemplifies destructive acts of hate.
1.4.4.5.1. Con: War demonstrates evil, but not excessive evil, because such a determination requires an omniscient perspective. A given war may lead to a butter-fly-effect that brings about net goods that outweigh and justify the net evils created by war.
1.4.4.5.1.1. Con: In the Judeo-Christian tradition, murder is forbidden by god and, thus, evil.
1.4.4.5.2. Pro: William Tecumseh Sherman claimed that, "[There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman#General_of_the_Army)."
1.4.4.5.3. Pro: In 1939, Germany initiated the [T4 Euthanasia Program](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005200) which is responsible for the death of 5,000 physically and mentally disabled German children. This program preceded the death camp exterminations.
1.4.4.5.4. Pro: During the Civil War the Confederate commander [Henry Wirz](http://all-that-is-interesting.com/worst-war-crimes-in-history) was responsible for the deaths of approximately 900 prisoners each month to a total of over 12,000 people at Fort Sumter.
1.4.4.5.5. Pro: It is [estimated](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2010.300070) that in the wars in Congo up to 1.8 million women in the Congo have been raped, averaging out to around 48 women per hour.
1.4.4.5.6. Pro: Many Armenians were killed during and after WWI by the Ottoman Empire. This event was later called[the Armenian Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide#The_U.S._Mission_in_the_Ottoman_Empire).
1.4.4.5.7. Pro: [World War 2](http://necrometrics.com/ww2stats.htm) was a particularly deadly and destructive war, accounting for more than 60 million deaths.
1.4.4.5.7.1. Pro: The [Japanese](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia) military slaughtered as many as 30 million Filipinos, Malays, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Indonesians and Burmese, of which at least 23 million of them were ethnic Chinese.
1.4.4.5.7.1.1. Pro: The [Japanese military](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia) enslaved millions and exploited them as forced laborers and prostitutes for front-line troops during the war.
1.4.4.5.7.1.2. Pro: Between 1937 and 1945, the Imperial Japanese Army conducted lethal [human experimentation](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/world/unmasking-horror-a-special-report-japan-confronting-gruesome-war-atrocity.html?pagewanted=all) in northeast China, predominantly on Chinese and Russian populations.
1.4.4.5.7.1.3. Pro: The death rate for Allied prisoners of war held by the Japanese was nearly [30 percent](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia).
1.4.4.5.7.1.4. Pro: While other counties responsible for atrocities in the war have paid [significant reparations](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia) for their actions, Japan has given its victims a mere $3 billion, while giving its own nationals around $400 billion in compensation for war losses.
1.4.4.5.7.1.5. Pro: [Japan](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia)was by far the largest opium producer in Asia throughout the first half of the 20th century, often exploiting addiction in exchange for gold and cultural artifacts.
1.4.4.5.7.1.5.1. Pro: [Yoshio Kodama](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/chalmers-johnson/the-looting-of-asia), a powerful individual with ties to the Japanese government, supplied heroin and liquor to occupied China and became rich.
1.4.4.5.7.2. Pro: [Stalin](http://news.stanford.edu/2010/09/23/naimark-stalin-genocide-092310/) starved and executed millions of people between 1930 and 1953.
1.4.4.5.7.3. Pro: Millions of people were needlessly tortured and killed in [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust).
1.4.4.5.7.4. Pro: War crimes committed by the Allied forces during the war were rarely prosecuted and ultimately deemed justifiable given the nature of the war.
1.4.4.5.7.4.1. Pro: In the [London Cage](http://listverse.com/2012/12/14/top-10-allied-war-crimes-of-world-war-ii/), housed in the Kensington Palace Gardens, members of the Schutzstaffel and Gestapo were starved, beaten, and deprived of sleep. No participants from the facility were ever prosecuted.
1.4.4.5.7.4.2. Pro: 12,000 [Slovene Home Guards](http://listverse.com/2012/12/14/top-10-allied-war-crimes-of-world-war-ii/) and their families were buried alive by Allied Yugoslaw Partisans in 1945. No one ever faced prosecution for this atrocity.
1.4.4.5.7.4.3. Pro: The Prisoners of War Temporary Enclosures \([Rheinwiesenlager](http://listverse.com/2012/12/14/top-10-allied-war-crimes-of-world-war-ii/)\) used to hold German POWs during the Allied occupation of Germany was poorly maintained, causing over 10,000 prisoners to die from starvation, exposure, and dehydration. Eisenhower ordered the prisoners to be classed as Disarmed Enemy Forces, in order to circumvent it being classified as a war crime.
1.4.4.5.7.4.4. Pro: After the fall of Berlin, It is believed that the Soviet Army alone was responsible for the rape of up to 100,000 women. The [Russian media](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32529679) regularly dismiss talk of the rapes as a Western myth.
1.4.4.5.7.4.5. Pro: The British bombed the unfortified and undefended city of [Dresden](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/15/bombing-dresden-war-crime) and killed over 25,000 people. This was justified as a tactical show of force.
1.4.5. Con: Evil is ill-defined.  There is no universally objective measure for evil so simply saying it exists is as insufficient as saying God exists because love exists.  One could say that eating another's child is evil because it causes harm but life is sustained by creatures eating the children of other creatures.  [merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evil)
1.4.5.1. Con: While there may be some grey areas, many events could be concieved which leave little doubt of it's evil. A predatory animal eating human baby may sustain animal's life but causes unjustified, cruel, direct physical harm to the baby and emotional harm to the victim's parents.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: The example given does not leave little doubt. Many humans would not consider eating a beef steak as an evil act. Likewise a predatory animal eating a human baby would be terrible for both the baby and its parents, but many would simply consider it a tragedy, rather than the animal having an evil motive.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: The predatory animal, its mate, and its offspring are the last of their kind. The human child is the only sustenance in range of the family of predators, and if allowed to grow to adulthood will massacre millions of people with detached earlobes in the most bizarre genocide ever. If the predator does not eat the child, its whole species dies. The purpose of this ridiculous construction is to show that the act itself is not immoral or evil, it is context and perspective which make it so.
1.4.5.2. Con: If "evil is ill-defined" then so too must good be "ill-defined", in which case it is incoherent to claim that God is "good". This is incompatible with a traditional conception of God as a being which is known to be good.
1.4.6. Con: Applying the concepts of "good" and "evil" to God is nonsensical.
1.4.6.1. Pro: The possibility for a God should not be reduced to a set of assumptions based on current religious and philosophical understandings.
Projecting human notions of "good" and "evil" onto a supposedly infinite being is fundamentally senseless.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: We need a limited set of assumptions to make discussions possible. If the set of assumptions is open then we might as well assume that God is evil.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Con: Axiology is the study of values. It can be approached like any other field of study. For example, how do we determine if one scientific theory is "better" than another theory? We do this by using axiological criteria \(deductive, inductive, and intuitive reasoning\). In terms of a maximally great being, he would be a being that possesses all great-making properties in maximally excellent form. We can determine what great-making properties are through deduction, induction, and intuition.
1.4.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.10.1.2.1.1.1.
1.4.6.1.2. Con: New assumptions should not be introduced without very good evidence.
1.4.6.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.1.1.
1.4.6.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.7.3.1.2.1.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Judgements of good and evil occur within human consciousness, and are bound by the same conditions as consciousness.  Dualities like good and evil are more indicative of our cognitive capacity to sort large amounts of information into two arbitrary dichotomous categories.  Therefore, the Question of Evil hinges upon the subjective definitions of human consciousness, and can not reflect actual states of spiritual or divine being.  In these cases, words become filters.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: Yet we have a concept of heaven which is objectively all good.
1.4.6.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.4.6.2.2. Con: God himself used words in holy texts and divine revelations to teach us what's good and evil.
1.4.6.2.2.1. Con: God provides us with some information, but not all. He may also have good reasons for concealing certain information from us. For example, he may want us to develop traits like curiosity, exploration, and reasoning. If he gave us all this information on a platter, then we would have the opportunity to develop our characters, which may constitute a [greater good](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.1113).
1.4.6.2.2.1.1. Con: Curiosity is often punished by God and blind obedience rewarded.
1.4.6.2.2.2. Pro: Most holy texts claim to be the ultimate truth.
1.4.6.3. Pro: The difference between an omniscient & omnipotent God and humanity is infinitely greater than the difference between humanity and single celled organisms. The concept of evil posed by humans, is to God, less significant than ants fighting in an ant farm. We may consider that we greatly overestimate our relationship and importance in the grand scheme of God's plan.
1.4.6.3.1. Con: The differences are irrelevant. We can still judge what seems evil to us and what causes us suffering.
This argument assumes that the big difference between God and humans makes God's concept of good incomprehensible to humans and that God doesn't care about what we feel is evil or what causes us suffering, which would negate our assumption that he is all caring and loving.
1.4.6.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.4.6.3.2. Pro: Omnipotence implies that there is no task more difficult than any other. If all tasks are of equal difficulty, they are all infinitely easy. Therefore there is no difference between possibility and actuality in the mind of God.
1.4.6.4. Pro: The existence of God does not require the belief of man nor would such a supreme being require the adherence to man's constructs of good and evil as such a being operates outside of time and space. Read this story on google books [tinyurl.com](https://tinyurl.com/yahxsqxu).
1.4.6.4.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that moral concepts are limited to apply within time and space.
1.4.6.5. Con: If God does not consider the same things evil which we consider evil, then we cannot claim to agree that He is benevolent.
1.4.6.6. Con: God is a concept created by 'Man' just like good and evil, the understanding of which varies from person to person, culture to culture. The society which keeps it defines it.
1.4.7. Con: Evil does not exist.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Many things which initially appear to be evil may, in fact, ultimately be good.
1.4.7.1.1. Pro: From an evolutionary point of view: Pain is necessary if not the prevailing truth behind life itself. Life learns by adapting in a way of avoiding pain and sufferig \(beginning with avoiding the dissolution in a microbiological environment\). A world without pain would not develop. Althought evolution driven by "some kind of entity" could use pain to show a certain path, this "entity" is more likely to not exist at all.
1.4.7.1.1.1. Con: If God wanted living beings to have certain traits, God could simply magically create traits without needing to cause adaptation to occur.
1.4.7.1.2. Pro: Insofar as what we regard as evil turns out to be part of a greater good, it is not really evil.
1.4.7.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.4.7.1.2.2. Pro: The principle of Double Effect as applied by God permits a lesser evil to exist, so long as the greater good is intended and achieved \(our knowledge of this good is not necessary\)
1.4.7.1.2.3. Con: The greater good can only be measured in some cases, and thus leads us to misunderstand evil through a comparison with something that is often unknowable.
1.4.7.1.2.4. Con: There is no greater good with personal evil. If ant has to sacrifice itself for the good of a colony, that may be good for  colony, but individual suffered an ultimate pain. Concept of greater good only delegates a problem of evil from individual to social.
1.4.7.1.3. Pro: Evil needs to exist in order to give us the perspective to understand goodness. Without the ability to contrast good things against evil ones, we would not be able to understand either concept.
1.4.7.2. Con: We observe that people have various moral opinions, that is ideas about what is evil. These things exist and are considered evil. Therefore \(the concept of\) evil exists.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: The existence of the concept of a thing does not entail the existence of a thing, or this would hold :
"The concept of unicorns exist, therefore unicorns exist".
1.4.7.3. Pro: Evil as defined by humanity is simply a natural phenomena, similar to animals eating each other, or a pack of animals fighting another. It can be attributed to in part status, in part survival, in part pathology, and in part the fallibility of physical organisms.
1.4.7.4. Con: Evil is the difference between what is and what ought to be, according to some objective standard. If there is an objective standard of "good" and "bad" or "evil" \(as is suggested by many theistic belief systems\), then evil must exist at least in concept even if it hasn't been realized.
1.4.7.4.1. Con: The merely conceptual, but unrealized, potential for evil to exist would not be incompatible with the existence of an all-powerful beneficent God, so "there is no realized evil," if true, would answer the argument from evil.
1.4.7.5. Pro: What we regard as evil is actually just ignorance.
1.4.7.5.1. Con: If evil is not real, then it is an illusion. The parent claim has to prove that ignorance is not also an illusion.
1.4.7.5.2. Con: Evil \(suffering\) by natural disasters is not a result of ignorance. It affects everybody, regardless if they are ignorant or not.
1.4.7.5.3. Pro: In many Buddhist traditions, evil is understood to result from the perpetuation of [ignorance](http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/Ignorance) of the world as it is.
1.4.7.5.3.1. Pro: Buddhist schools defined various levels of [ignorance](http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/Ignorance), teaching that, by cutting off increasingly deeper levels of ignorance, one can gradually gain understanding of the true aspect of existence and finally escape suffering.
1.4.7.5.3.1.1. Pro: The concept of ignorance in [Shingon Buddhism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kukai/) is used to explain how embodied beings succumb to different kinds of suffering, and further how ignorance lies at the center of all suffering.
1.4.7.5.3.1.2. Pro: In [Zen Buddhism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-zen/), ignorance is the fundamental state of human perception and understanding.
1.4.7.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: [Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki](https://books.google.com/books?id=o2d7wV4Ttx4C&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=ignorance+in+zen+buddhism&source=bl&ots=cpkWNL_wM9&sig=B6ECgZvaMnayw84geUbDlzlGNmc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiu-bSwv7PYAhXFNiYKHT0eAYA4ChDoAQhQMAc#v=onepage&q=ignorance%20in%20zen%20buddhism&f=false), a very prominent Rinzai Zen master, argued that all the struggles we face are the result of this fundamental ignorance.
1.4.7.5.3.1.3. Pro: [Bhikkhu Bodhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhikkhu_Bodhi) \(2003\), a prominent Theravada Buddhist monk, states that, "ignorance \([avijja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidy%C4%81_\(Buddhism\)#Theravada)\) obscures perception of the true nature of things just as a cataract obscures perception of visible objects."
1.4.7.5.3.2. Pro: [Ignorance](http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/Ignorance) is understood as one of the two causes of suffering.
1.4.7.5.3.2.1. Pro: The second cause of suffering, [craving](http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/Craving), is related to ignorance because it characterizes our search for fulfillment based on our delusional misunderstanding of the world.
1.4.7.5.3.2.2. Pro: In the [Tendai school](http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/Tendai), ignorance is regarded as that which prevents one from perceiving the [Middle Way](http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/Middle_Way), which is characterized as the life of moderation between indulgence and self inflicted pain.
1.4.7.5.3.3. Con: This only delegates the problem of evil to the problem of ignorance. "The world as it is is not evil, but ignorant." In any case, it is still a creation of a same God.
1.4.7.5.4. Pro: Under this characterization, wisdom and mindfulness are properly recognized as virtues, as they can be used to mitigate suffering.
1.4.7.5.5. Pro: In [consequentialist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/) terms, ignorance of the present circumstances leads to making more mistakes and ultimately results in more suffering.
1.4.7.5.6. Pro: What is evil to the receiver, is viewed as a positive event to the one doing the harm.  Our pre-occupation with self blocks our seeing the larger world beyond self.
1.4.7.5.7. Con: As Buddhism teaches, suffering \(evil\) is the result of ignorance. Since ignorance is the source of suffering, then ignorance is also evil.
1.4.7.6. Pro: Evil is just a lack of goodness.
1.4.7.6.1. Con: If evil did not exist and all existence were "perfect" then all existence would be Godlike and no one God would be necessary. God is the constructive force and evil the destructive force which together form all existence.
1.4.7.6.2. Con: Why do we choose that evil is a lack of good, surely the choice is completely arbitrary. Therefore the reasoning is null and void as we decide what is good or evil.
1.4.7.6.2.1. Con: A solution to the initial apparent contradiction is bound to rely upon a better definition of the terms, as they do not have the same meaning for all.  
Refusing this work of clarification is refusing the discussion altogether.
1.4.7.6.2.2. Con: The choice is not arbitrary as it reflects the work of christian theologians who have pondered this very problem for long. They finally retained this solution because they deemed it logically sound and preserving the tenants of the christian faith.
1.4.7.6.2.3. Con: Evil is quite obviously a quality, but "what kind of quality" is the subject of the parent debate. The question is not arbitrary, and the concept that evil is a privation is at worst ad hoc but at best is genius.
1.4.7.6.3. Con: To tell a man trapped outdoors in a blizzard that cold doesn't really exist, but is merely the absence of heat, will do nothing to save him from freezing to death. We can accuse God of allowing evil as surely as we can accuse the one who does that of allowing the man to be cold.
1.4.7.6.3.1. Con: Saying evil is the lack of goodness or separation from God is correct. If explained properly, it would be like telling the man in the blizzard that he needs to come in and warm up. He is lacking something he needs to survive \(heat\). God invites us to follow Him and sin no more \(turn from evil\).
1.4.7.6.4. Pro: The measurement of good and evil can be likened to the measure of hot and cold.  Using science we know that heat is a measurement of motion, but cold is just a measurement of the lack of heat.  Objects can create heat but not create cold.
1.4.7.6.4.1. Con: If one is asked "why is this room so cold," to say that coldness does not exist but is merely the absence of heat does not constitute an answer; likewise, to say that evil is merely the absence of good does not constitute an answer to the problem of evil.
1.4.7.6.5. Pro: God can make things more or less good, and thus can create what is known as evil without contradiction.
1.4.7.6.5.1. Pro: Omnipotence and omnibenevolence are preserved as God can reward subjects with varying degrees of goodness, without ever having to acknowledge that evil exists.
1.4.7.6.6. Con: If evil was a lack of goodness, there would be less suffering on Earth. Given that there is an abundance of suffering on Earth, goodness should be understood as the lack of evil.
1.4.7.6.6.1. Con: There is more good in this world than evil therefore good is the dominant factor at play not evil
1.4.7.6.6.1.1. Con: There is more neutral than evil in the world, there is not more good.
Going about your day doesn't make you good.
Not hurting others doesn't make you good.
Giving a few dollars to the charity that's currently trending doesn't make you good.
It make you neutral.
To be good you have to make real sacrifices. You have to go out of your way to do something, for no other reason than to make life better for others. That is what it means to be good.
And there is precious little of that.
1.4.7.6.7. Con: Even if evil does not exist, there are certainly parts of the world that are less good than they could possibly be. A benevolent God would make everything as good as possible, so this is still strong evidence against God's existence.
1.4.7.6.7.1. Con: The universe is not in the state of affairs as God created it according to most religious traditions. The paradise was lost thousands of years ago.
1.4.7.6.7.2. Con: Maximal good involves the possibility to grow at different speed \(for beauty/enjoying purposes\), making several states of "good" co-existing together as the best logical creation.
1.4.7.6.8. Con: Even if evil is merely a lack of goodness, there is an evident lack of goodness in the world. Thus, one should doubt the existence of an all-good God.
1.4.7.7. Pro: There is no \(good\) or \(evil\) when it comes to human behavior. Individuals' actions show to what lengths a that person will go to satisfy their own needs. Some humans have a higher ability to feel compassion, a sense of self worth within a group atmosphere. Others simply focus on their own wants and perceived needs.
1.4.7.8. Pro: Presupposing the existence of evil also presupposes humankind at the center of existence. Remove people from the center and the problem of evil disappears.
1.4.7.8.1. Con: The existence of evil does not presuppose that humankind sits at the center of existence. Even without humans evil exists, it is how you define evil. Animals can act "evil" if you will...
1.4.7.8.1.1. Con: Animals don't appear to have a moral concept. They follow instincts to survive and reproduce. The fact that they can suffer does not mean that they can act evil.
1.4.7.9. Pro: There is no objective standard by which to determine what counts as evil
1.4.7.9.1. Con: A fixed standard is not necessary to make such a judgement, especially since such standards can vary culturally.
1.4.7.9.1.1. Pro: In some Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia, apostasy and atheism are punishable by lashes, imprisonment and even beheading. People are free to express their beliefs in Western democratic societies while they believe these are morally reprehensible crimes in theirs.
1.4.7.9.1.1.1. Con: If there is no moral standard, then neither beheading for apostasy nor expressing beliefs is objectively better or worse than the other.
1.4.7.9.1.2. Pro: Some Muslim countries like Iran believe it to be morally good to have women completely covered in a burka, while most western countries believe this to be a morally inferior practice that objectifies and oppresses women.
1.4.7.9.2. Pro: Good and evil are the opinion of humanity. In order for God to be perfect he must include attributes of existence that go beyond what is solely good for individual and limited beings— otherwise he wouldn't be perfect because he would be limited by the deficit of those imaginable but lacking possibilities. The most pleasant of all possible worlds is not to be confused with the fullest of all possible worlds. Infinite attributes combined in infinite compossible ways, guarantees this.
1.4.7.9.3. Con: An objective standard of evil is not required to understand the meaning of the concept in regards to its place alongside God. As an entirely subjective abstraction, varied by environment and personality, each person has their own conception of evil relative to their own conception of God.
1.4.7.9.3.1. Con: Subjective definitions of evil do not imply any contradiction in the nature of God.
1.4.7.9.4. Pro: Evil could be a question of perspective. Maybe something that may be evil for someone represents good news or benefit for other.
1.4.7.9.5. Con: Empathy serves as subjective evidence for the existence of evil, as most people are capable of taking on perspectives of people who have performed or are performing evil acts, and this is evidence enough.
1.4.7.9.5.1. Con: Empathy does not suffice as an objective moral standard. A feeling that something is evil does not make that thing objectively evil, but simply subjectively "evil".
1.4.7.9.6. Con: Objective moral judgments can be made so long as parties agree on a criterion for morality.  A subjective moral standard still allows for actions to be objectively judged as moral or not.
1.4.7.9.6.1. Con: "Objective" by definition must not include opinion or feelings in the definition.  Whereas "morality" is a completely subjective definition of peoples opinion and feelings.  So an agreed upon moral Judgment would be by definition be Subjective not Objective
1.4.7.9.6.1.1. Con: Evil does not need to objectively defined \(apart from humans\) for it to be real.
1.4.7.9.7. Pro: Without an objective standard, labeling something as "evil" or "immoral" is simply a subjective statement.
1.4.7.9.7.1. Con: Within the context of talking about a Judeo-Christian God, good and evil do have known, explicitly defined definitions \(such as the Ten Commandments\). To discard them entirely as a defense in favor of God's existence would be self-defeating.
1.4.7.9.7.1.1. Con: A believer in the Judeo-Christian God would not discard the given definitions of good and evil.
1.4.7.9.8. Pro: Morals are a social construct.
1.4.7.9.8.1. Con: Being a social construct does not mean it's not real. Pain and suffering are both social constructs, that doesn't make them any less real.
1.4.7.9.8.1.1. Con: Morality is not analogous to pain and suffering. Pain can be shown to exist while moral facts cannot.
1.4.7.9.8.2. Con: Most accounts of God require God to be benevolent. If morality does not exist, the concept of benevolence is meaningless, so a traditional concept of God cannot exist.
1.4.7.9.8.3. Con: If God exists then evil would not be only a human construction \(assuming a classical understanding of God\). God would either determine what is and is not evil when they created the universe or God would follow universal rules about what is good or evil.
1.4.7.9.8.3.1. Con: A belief in God does not create Evil, even though humans can suffer from aversion, mental or physical pain.
1.4.7.9.8.3.2. Pro: This does not mean that the human conception of evil is aligned with God's, as it is possible for humans to be wrong about what constitutes good and evil.
1.4.7.9.9. Con: Everyone knows what pain is, but there is no objective standard of pain. If a group of people can can independently identify something as pain, then it is pain. The same applies to evil.
1.4.7.10. Con: -> See 1.4.4.
1.4.7.11. Pro: Evil in this world may not be real evil. The same way a filmmaker is not performing evil deeds when she makes a movie where evil things happen, the creator God may still be benevolent and create a world whose characters believe they are experiencing evil things, because those things are not real at the level of God's superior reality. This world may be to God like a piece of fiction is to us.
1.4.7.11.1. Con: Forcing one's creation to suffer for entertainment is not a benevolent act.
1.4.7.11.1.1. Con: If god is creating some kind of fiction, he does not necessarily take away the freedom of the "actor", so he might still not be the one inflicting the suffering.
1.4.7.11.1.2. Con: Doing so could be a benevolent act if it achieves a greater good than would be logically possible in its absense. \(this argument assumes a definition of omnipotence which entails the power to do all things, "thing" being a logically coherent event/proposition\).
1.4.7.11.1.2.1. Con: There is nothing to support that this could possibly be the case.
1.4.7.11.1.3. Con: The suffering of my creations is not real suffering, at most it's an imitation of suffering. Therefore there is no evil in creating those characters.
1.4.7.11.2. Pro: Evil in this world may not exist any more than evil in a bad dream. If we are dreaming this dimension, for instance in holographic form, it may be us that has dreamed the evil, not God. Waking up from the dream may evaporate evil in the same way waking up from a nightmare does. It just didn't exist in the first place.
1.4.7.11.3. Con: Arguing that evil isn't real because those things aren't real is scant comfort to those who have experienced terrible pain because of choices of others \(evil\). You might not consider my pain "real", but it's real to me.
1.4.7.12. Con: Even if we disagree on where the boundaries of evil and its origin, we can all agree that evil does exist in this world as a product of free will.
1.4.7.12.1. Pro: "Evil" is a quality of something that identifies it as lying outside of its normal, moral intention.
1.4.7.12.2. Pro: For example, we can all agree sex should be mutually consented to by all parties and that sex without consent deviates from what is considered moral. Therefore we can agree that rape is evil.
1.4.7.12.2.1. Con: Yet people praise the prisoners who take it upon themselves to serve justice by raping sex offenders in prison, an "eye for an eye" mindset. No, I think we can't all agree that rape is evil.
1.4.7.13. Con: We consider diseases, death, violence and other of these things evil, otherwise we wouldn't try to escape them with all means. Even if we say that evil doesn't exists by words, our actions demonstrate that we always try to limit some external and internal factors. Whether we want to call these factors "evil" or not, it's just a matter of definition.
1.4.7.13.1. Con: The concept of "evil" implies sentient intent; accidental and coincidental occurrences do not fit the usually accepted definition.
1.4.7.13.2. Con: The fact that we try to escape from something's effect does not prove we think it's evil - it proves we simply would prefer not to be affected by it.
1.4.7.14. Con: Evil can be defined as an action or behavior that exhibits profound immorality or wickedness. These specific behaviors can be easily observed. In this regard, saying that evil does not exist is like saying sadistic people don't exist.
1.4.7.15. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.1.
1.4.7.16. Con: To say that evil does not exist in a world where children have their hearts cut out while their screams are filmed is preposterous.
1.4.7.16.1. Con: Evil is to gross as good is to tasty.  Evil is a description for something undesirable.  What is undesirable is subjective and circumstantial.  The question is a non sequitur.
1.4.7.16.2. Con: To think that cutting out hearts is evil is up to one's beliefs, to the Aztec priest it may be a holy act of worship \(good\), to the atheist it is an act of cruel barbarism \(bad\).
1.4.7.17. Pro: If one takes the position that there is no moral authority greater than man, then evil is a human construct. It exists, but only conceptually in the mind's of mankind.
1.4.7.18. Con: In the Judeo-Christian tradition, "evil" has a known definition \(that which God forbids people to do\). Therefore, dismissing the concept of evil itself dismisses the notion of God.
1.4.7.19. Pro: What we call evil now falls within the spectrum of [good vs. bad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Genealogy_of_Morality#First_Treatise:_.22.27Good_and_Evil.27.2C_.27Good_and_Bad.27.22), rather than good vs. evil.
1.4.7.19.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.6.7.
1.4.7.20. Pro: Evil is just a word we use to describe actions or events with an arbitrary level of severity. Thus, it is better understood as a term of emphasis, rather than a thing itself.
1.4.7.20.1. Con: The threshold of when an act is considered evil is not arbitrary.
1.4.7.20.1.1. Con: In many cases the threshold of when an act is considered evil depends of the subject that observe the fact.
1.4.7.21. Pro: If God approves that something happens that thing is automatically good, he is the supreme being that is the only non-subjective origin of moral values. The existence of a monotheistic God excludes the existence of evil. Not vice versa.
1.4.7.21.1. Con: If God's approval of something makes that thing good, then if God approved of torturing babies, torturing babies would be good. But torturing babies is not good, so this cannot be the case.
1.4.7.21.2. Con: If God created all that exists, then God created our capacity to experience "suffering" \(that which should not be\) and "evil" \(deciding to inflict suffering\) as aspects of our finite experience. Within that bounded context, evil exists, although from God's unbounded perspective, it does not exist as such. Therefore evil can best be conceived of as an illusion that is real but only within the context of the "dream" that is our experience of finite existence.
1.4.7.21.3. Con: If Good approved free will, than it is a automatically good. But abusing free will is not good.
1.4.7.22. Con: If evil does not exist, a boundary to what isn't good can't be set. This calls into question the boundaries of what constitutes goodness and thus any conception of God that entails good and evil.
1.4.7.22.1. Con: Evil may still exist on a conceptual level, meaning that one could at least think of something that is evil, but God has excluded all manifestations of evil from the universe.
1.4.7.22.1.1. Con: The parent claim implies that evil conceptually exists, outside the universe. There is nothing outside the universe.
1.4.7.23. Pro: Evil exists only in a relative sense. That is to say, it is always dependent on the observer. One thing may be evil to me but not to you. Hence it may be that evil exists on a relative scale, among people like me and you, but not to God on an absolute scale.
1.4.7.23.1. Pro: Since all subjective positions can exist within the single objective oneness \(of traditional God\), there is no incompatibility. 
\(For example, if I kill another person, this is subjectively good for me and subjectively evil for that other person, regardless of an objective perspective\)
1.4.7.23.1.1. Con: Church means congregation, and stresses a social dimension for each individual. Same idea can be found in physics where every particle affect others; in biology society is beneficial for survival, in psychology for the self growth. So, society is an advantage. Society condemns suicide for the same reason, for depriving one's self from contributing to the society. So any evil in society is not just a private matter among individuals. Killing is bad for society. That is exactly a God's viewpoint.
1.4.7.23.1.2. Con: There is incompatibility in evil and good not canceling themselves to nothing. Suffering of one person and disturbing the peace remains, so evil remains to an objective observer. Humans are conditioned, so subjectivity can be attributed to them, but God is absolute and should be regarded as neutral, like a law of physics. Traditional concept of God actually claim that God equally loves both saints and sinners. He only responds according to their preferred relationship with Him.
1.4.7.23.2. Con: Evil exists, even if it exists only as a perceived phenomenon. It occurs as defined \(socially constructed\) based on observation.
1.4.7.23.3. Con: -> See 1.4.6.5.
1.4.7.23.4. Con: The claim relativizes morality. If evil is relative, then a murderer "only relatively" killed a victim. This denies God's justice and human legal system. Nobody would have any ground to judge in a meaningful way, judgement would be a whim of a despot ruler.
1.4.7.23.5. Pro: Evil is an anthropocentric idea. There was no evil prior to the appearance of humans.
1.4.7.23.5.1. Con: There were no human witnesses prior to the existence of humans, so we have no way of determining whether the concept was exclusive to humans.
1.4.7.23.5.2. Con: God put many limits on human capabilities but he did not limit human ability to reject God's guidance or do evil. Therefore God is complicit in human evil deeds.
1.4.7.23.5.3. Con: There are many other evil events like natural disasters that are not caused by human activity.
1.4.7.23.5.3.1. Con: "Evil" [means profoundly immoral and wicked](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/evil). Natural disasters and events cannot be evil, as they are amoral and neutral in character.

The only evil that may be associated with natural disasters and events is if evil people deliberately expose others to, or refuse to help victims of, a natural disaster or event.
1.4.7.23.5.3.1.1. Con: Natural disasters are only amoral if we assume that they happen by themselves and nobody has willful control over them.
An all powerful God assumes that he has control over them.
Scriptures say that he creates them.
1.4.7.23.5.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.5.1.1.1.
1.4.7.23.5.3.1.2. Con: In the link you provided, evil is also defined as "harmful or tending to harm". Thus, natural disasters still constitute evils in this sense.
1.4.7.23.5.4. Con: If God existed before the appearance of humans, and had an opinion on what was good and evil, then evil is not an anthropocentric idea.
1.4.7.24. Con: If we accept that evil does not exist, then this legitimates sin. St. Paul makes this point in Rom 3:7, explained [here](https://bible.org/seriespage/study-and-exposition-romans-31-8).
1.4.7.25. Pro: Things only appear to be evil from an incomplete perspective. But from the perspective of those who have faith, suffering is seen to only be temporary.
1.4.7.25.1. Con: The Bible acknowledges the existence of evil, and says that people with faith will still experience it in the form of temptations and suffering. "So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members." 
- Romans 7:19-24
1.4.7.25.2. Pro: The concept that suffering is only temporary is introduced in the book of Job.
1.4.7.25.3. Pro: This concept is expounded upon by St. Augustine in 'city of God'.
1.5. Pro: If God were omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, then evil would not exist.
1.5.1. Pro: If God was really all knowing, he would know about evil. If God was really all powerful, he would be able to remove it. If God was all loving, he would want to remove it. He cannot be all three at once.
1.5.1.1. Con: It is possible that God is not all powerful, and that evil has equal or more power than him. If so, he can still be all good & all knowing.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: A non-omnipotent god is not the monotheistic god.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: God as traditionally conceived is classical theism, which is a belief in a maximally great being. A maximally great being is omnipotent, since it is greater to be all-powerful than to be lacking in power.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: As an explanatory hypothesis, a maximally great being has a higher intrinsic probability than a powerful but limited being. Therefore, we should err on the side of believing in a maximally great being over ones that have deficiencies \(such as a God who is impotent against evil\).
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: \(2\) Theism has a high intrinsic probability because of its simplicity. According to Occam's Razor, when choosing between competing hypotheses we should pick the one requiring the fewest additional assumptions. Theism posits a maximally great being, or "unlimited" being. This is also the simplest conceivable being, since you do not have to add any limiting forces, which would require more assumptions. As such, theism has a high intrinsic probability as an explanatory hypothesis for the universe.
1.5.1.2. Pro: [Epicurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma#Epicurus'_trilemma) put it best: 

“Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. 
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. 
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? 
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?”
1.5.1.2.1. Con: In the Bible it is said that God states His ways can not be understood by humans.  \(Isaiah 55:8 "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,"\) Therefore our definitions of omnipotent, malevolent, evil and God can not comply to His.
Therefore what Epicurus actually describes is our impotence in understanding, not God's impotence in acting.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: An ant is incapable of understanding the motivations, wills, thoughts and capabilities of the human which has held a magnifying glass above it to set it aflame, that fact does not make the human's actions any less cruel to the ant.
1.5.1.2.2. Con: Evil is limited, by God to a specific space \(Jude 1:9, Job 1\) and time \(a.o Matthew 24:36 ESV, Luke 21:36 ESV\).
For reasons know only to Him God allows evil for now.
1.5.1.2.2.1. Con: This does not properly account for the idea that an all powerful, all knowing, all loving God, would have no need to constrict evil to such a time and place to begin with.  They could just make it impossible by virtue of their own perfection in knowledge, power, and morality
1.5.1.2.3. Con: God \(according to the books\) enacts evil to prevent more evil, he has been told to do this many times over \(Old Testament\) Ark of Noah, Exodus out of Egypt etc.
1.5.1.2.3.1. Con: This still portrays a God who either chose to enact evil, even if to prevent evil, or was incapable of achieving positive results by positive action.
1.5.1.3. Pro: If a god can have a child who has all the answers and doesn't have one every couple of centuries, that god is not good.
1.5.1.3.1. Con: An all-loving God would not want to remove evil if a greater good were only achievable with the existence of evil.
1.5.1.3.1.1. Pro: For example, certain human virtues may only be possible to attain with the existence of evil. It may be greater for these virtues to be possible than not possible. Therefore, evil may be necessary to achieve this greater good.
1.5.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: It may be a greater good for people to develop certain virtues than for God to simply implant these virtues directly into people.
1.5.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.
1.5.1.3.1.2. Con: Permitting the anguish of an innocent child to "teach" is itself an evil act.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1. Con: This isn't necessarily true. For example, we take children to the dentist \(temporary pain\) in order to achieve a greater good \(dental health\). Something similar may occur with God's use of suffering, except on a larger scale \(since eternal stakes may be at hand\).
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: If god cannot achieve a greater good without the use of suffering then he is not all powerful.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.
1.5.1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.5.1.3.1.2.2. Con: There may be inter-related uses of suffering. Teaching/developing virtues may only be one of a number of purposes God has for permitting suffering. Taken together, this network of purposes may sufficiently justify its use. However, we lack the omniscient perspective to see or comprehend all these purposes.
1.5.1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: It's easy to come with ways to teach or develop without using evil acts.
1.5.1.3.1.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.4.
1.5.1.3.1.3. Pro: Omnipotence means God can do anything \(any "thing"\). However, not all described actions are coherent, and thus not really things. For example, God cannot make a two-sided triangle, because such a described action is incoherent. Likewise, achieving the greatest feasible good without the existence of evil may entail an incoherent proposition. If so, God could not create such a world because such a described world would be incoherent.
1.5.1.3.1.3.1. Con: There is no reason to assume such a possibility without a hypothetical example.
1.5.1.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: Hypothetical examples might include the [character defenses](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1960.512) and [providing humans with free will](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.38). Both of these things may be logically necessary in a greatest feasible world.
1.5.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.3.1.1.
1.5.1.3.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.5.1.3.1.3.4. Con: There is no apparent contradiction in a concept of a world without evil.
1.5.1.3.1.3.4.1. Con: There may be implicit contradictions, which only an omniscient being could perceive.
1.5.1.3.1.3.5. Con: God created heaven that has no evil demonstrating that such a world is possible without contradictions.
1.5.1.3.1.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.5.1.
1.5.1.4. Con: There could be dire consequences for the removal of the possibility of evil which are worse than evil as we understand it.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: If God banished evil from existance, or hadn't conceived it at first, we would have been conceived as similar beings to him, therefore losing his status as a god.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Con: All good does not imply all powerful. Thus, even if evil did not exist, humans could still be distinct as less powerful creatures, and he would not lose his status as god.
1.5.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: If God is a maximally great being, than he possesses all great-making properties in perfect form. By creating perfectly good creatures, God may still reserve other perfect attributes for himself, which he alone possesses--such as aseity, omnipotence, etc.
1.5.1.4.1.2. Con: There is no reason to believe this is a less perfect version of the world. As an omnipotent, benevolent, all-knowing being, God should have created the most perfect version of the world possible.
1.5.1.4.1.3. Con: Similarity is not the same as equality. God may create beings similar to himself in certain regards without creating beings equal to himself.
1.5.1.4.2. Con: It is logically incoherent to describe a state of affairs as being "worse" than evil. Such a state of affairs would simply consist of greater evil than the former state.
1.5.1.4.2.1. Pro: For example, if God removing the holocaust resulted in an event ten times worse than the holocaust, than he has simply caused a greater evil to exist by removing the former evil.
1.5.1.4.3. Con: God made the rules. The existence of an all powerful creator necessarily means he could remove the possibility of evil without any dire consequences.
1.5.1.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.5.1.5. Pro: If God is the best father and most benevolent being, the idea of it enjoying suffering and eternal doom in hell for its creation does not match. There is no proof of God's existence, only incongruousness in this belief.
1.5.1.5.1. Con: Theism is an explanatory hypothesis. Its plausibility depends on \(1\) the extent to which the hypothesis predicts the sort of universe we find ourselves in and \(2\) its [simplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) as a hypothesis. Theism fits these criteria and is therefore a plausible explanatory hypothesis.
1.5.1.5.1.1. Pro: \(1\) Every particle in the universe obeys the same laws. This would be an enormous coincidence if the universe had no creator, but it is what you'd expect if there were a creator, since order is an indication of design. Likewise, given enough time, these particles and laws give birth to human beings, who have agency, intelligence, and morality. This would be a highly unlikely result if there were no creator, but it is something you'd predict \(or at least find plausible\) if there were a creator.
1.5.1.5.1.1.1. Con: Using the existence of a lawful Universe as evidence for God as a creator is reasonable, but extended, limits the possibility of an all powerful God. If God created the Universe, who or what created God? If an all powerful God came into existence spontaneously, or has always existed, why too couldn't the known Universe have done the same.
1.5.1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: God's [simplicity](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1960.1344) as a maximally great being gives theism a high intrinsic probability under Ockham's Razor. A "maximally great being" is a simpler proposition than "the known universe", since it requires fewer assumptions. The universe contains various arbitrary limited forces and energy/matter quantities, which make it a far more complex proposition than traditional theism, which defines the first cause as simply an unlimited, perfect being.
1.5.1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: By definition, a maximally great being possesses all great-making properties in maximal form. Aseity is one such property. Aseity means "self-sufficient" or "self-explanatory." Since the known universe is not a maximally great being \(it contains identifiably limitations, such as the speed of light being 299 792 458 m/s\), we have no reason to think that it possesses aseity. In contrast, God would possess aseity by definition.
1.5.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: God, as a maximally great being, possesses all great-making properties. One such property is aseity, which means being "self-sufficient" or "self-explanatory." Therefore, God \(if God exists\) does not need an external explanation.
1.5.1.5.1.2. Con: Theism is less informed than a new born infant defining his or her parent. Being a result of the evolution of, and bound by the laws of the Universe, humans are ill equipped to define God as something beyond the Universe. Plausability does not ensure existence, nor does it ensure accuracy of terms such as God, or maximal greatness. Simplicity of theory is also not required, nor does it necessitate accuracy.
1.5.1.5.1.2.1. Con: Regardless of how ill-equipped we are due to our limited faculties, theism remains a plausible hypothesis relative to alternative theories about the origins of the universe relying on these same faculties. Thus it remains a robust hypothesis relative to our capacity to make hypotheses about what \(if anything\) caused the universe to exist. In other words, it shows that theism is a robust theory about universe origins insofar as we are able to conceive of such theories.
1.5.1.5.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.10.1.1.
1.5.1.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.2.1.
1.5.1.5.2. Con: If God were to create a time-limit for humans to access the benefits of heaven and escape hell that would stop God from withholding the justice that hell entails for his enemies.
1.5.1.5.3. Con: Nothing supports the claim that God could enjoy suffering, in any form. By definition he doesn't.
1.5.1.6. Con: Omnipotence may not be intended as "God can do everything", but that God can do anything that is not excluded from HIS logic or from HIS nature.
1.5.1.6.1. Con: Saying that God can do anything that isn't excluded from his logic or his nature is essentially saying that god can do anything except the things that he can't do; this is a terrible definition of omnipotence.
1.5.1.6.1.1. Con: This is a subjective judgment. Further, the definition above may be reflective of traditional conceptions of monotheism, making it a viable definition of omnipotence for purposes of this topic \(which deals with God as "traditionally conceived"\).
1.5.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.2.
1.5.1.6.2. Pro: The conception of God articulated in recent Catholic documents such as the [Regensburg address by Benedict XVI](http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7155) views omnipotence as excluding the possibility of acting contrary to God's nature.
1.5.1.6.3. Pro: If we modify God's omnipotence with his omnibenevolence, God cannot do evil. This would simply mean that God was restricted from doing evil himself by his own nature. Thus, God cannot prevent evils if the means is evil.
1.5.1.6.3.1. Con: If we focus in the Christian God: He did actually drown the whole world to purge it from evil; he did fully destroy Sodoma and Gomorra and turned Lot's wife into salt just for looking back when she was told not to do so. These two examples, among many others in the Bible, indicate that God is actually capable of evil.
1.5.1.6.4. Pro: There's a distinction between what God can do \(which makes Him omnipotent\) and what God will do \(which makes Him righteous\).
1.5.1.6.5. Con: The term "his logic" makes logic arbitrary. If logic is a creation, then God could have made logic in any way that he pleased. This would mean that God still *can* do everything, he just *won't*. This is precisely the problem of God and evil, that evil exists and God won't stop it.
1.5.1.6.5.1. Pro: The only way to understand logic if God created it, is that evil is outside of any logic God created.
1.5.1.6.5.1.1. Con: Problem of evil does not exist in Dharmic religions, there it is resolved by karma. Proper way to formulate claim would be like: "outside the logic of Abrahamic religions", but that is silly.
1.5.1.6.5.2. Pro: If an omnibenevolent God would stop or prevent evil right away, it would mean that he would have fully intended it, and then it could not be evil.
1.5.1.6.5.3. Con: God continuously chooses to be good, he continuously chooses to let evil out of his logic, making him logically unable to stop it because he does not know anything about it, unless there is a connection between evil and good. The Bible suggests that God's self-sacrifice is this connection.
1.5.1.6.5.3.1. Con: If god knows nothing about evil then he is not omniscient.
1.5.1.6.5.4. Con: God did not create logic, he created the universe with logic.\(Like the Wisdom in Judaism, or Logos in Christianity and the whole ancient world\) If logic is arbitrary how can you say something about him and still pretend it is relevant?
1.5.1.6.6. Con: The Bible does not seem to show a consistent pattern of what lies within God's nature/logic. He created the realm of Hell to punish the wicked, yet allows [Satan walk free](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+28%3A15-17&version=NASB) to terrorize the world. He allows Elisha to [summon bears to maul people to death](https://bible.org/seriespage/4-elisha-and-two-bears-2-kings-223-25) for insulting him. He [drowns the whole planet](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+7) rather than smiting individual evildoers. These suggest God is not limited in his methods for preventing evil or enacting acts of evil himself.
1.5.1.6.6.1. Con: None of the examples given are inconsistent with the claimed love nature of God but have strong christian bible-based explanations.
1.5.1.6.7. Con: Affirming that God is bounded by his logic or nature implies that are rules or systems above God, and not implicitly created by him.
1.5.1.7. Pro: If Evil, as we perceive it, didn't exist, we would only have varying degrees of Good to compare. The lesser Good, in this case, would then seem relatively "Evil" and we would be incapable of grasping the concept of that greater Evil which God, in their benevolence, would have spared us from. We have no way of knowing that we're not being spared from True Evil.
1.5.1.7.1. Con: Claim still has to prove that some \(True?\) evil is necessary.
1.5.1.7.2. Con: Claim is basically an excuse for ignorance. It is same as "what if there is God greater than your God". So, my God is stronger than yours, you are only ignorant about mine. Same goes for evil, there is a True Evil which trumps other evils, and humans are just ignorant. In other words, claim explains that the cause of evil is mystery.
1.5.1.7.2.1. Con: This is ad hominem, as it imposes a personal motive into the argument \(e.g. an excuse\).
1.5.1.7.2.1.1. Con: True, but used colloquially like this it is aimed at human nature, not at human personality.
1.5.1.7.3. Con: Claim relativize morality. If a crime was committed, a criminal would excuse himself by saying: "If good God allowed this to happen, then the reason for my crime must be some greater good. My act prevented greater evil".
1.5.1.7.3.1. Con: This would not help the criminal personally, however, since the criminal has elected not to reap the benefits of the greater good, but instead to reap the negative effects \(e.g. punishment\) of the necessary evils.
1.5.1.7.3.1.1. Con: Then acting in accordance with God's will would be punishable, which is evil for the criminal, and he would be another one who cries at God "Why are You like that?"
1.5.1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: God's "will" can be talked about in multiple senses. In one sense God may will the good of everyone, but only on certain terms \(such as them utilizing their free-will in a good as opposed to bad manner\). Thus, by entailment, he also wills \(in a different sense\) that those who misuse their free-will experience punishment. We can call these "WA" and "WB". A criminal has gone against WA, and thus received punishment under WB. He has chosen WB and has no right to complain about not receiving WA.
1.5.1.7.4. Con: Claim only gives a biased value to evil: "This was evil, but it was worth."
1.5.1.7.5. Pro: True evil does not exist.
1.5.1.7.5.1. Pro: True evil exists implies existence which is contradictory to the notion of true evil which is non existence.
1.5.1.7.5.1.1. Con: True evil is not non-existence, non-existence is neutral, and evil is what ought not to be.
1.5.1.7.6. Con: Mass genocides. Racism. Murder. Torture.  Psychopaths.  We have seen true evil already.
1.5.1.8. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.
1.5.1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.
1.5.1.10. Con: The existence of an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent god is logically compatible with the existence of evil \(there's no explicit contradiction\). So the burden is to show that the existence of such a God is unlikely, given the existence of evil, rather than logically impossible.
1.5.1.10.1. Con: If God is Omniscient and Omnipotent, it means he Knows about evil and Can end it, but he doesn't. This logically counteracts any assumption that God is good.
1.5.1.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.
1.5.1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.
1.5.1.10.3. Con: The grandparent principles grant that 1\) because God is all knowing, he is ignorant of no evil; 2\) because God is all powerful, he can prevent all evil; and 3\) because God is all good, he will act to prevent all evil that he both knows about and can prevent \(which is all\).

Because being good is obligatory in this way, the omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent God is explicitly contradictory with the existence of evil.
1.5.1.10.3.1. Con: Although premise 3 might well be true, its negation is still logically consistent. Therefore, an omniscient omnipotent and omnibenevolent god \(is at least logically\) consistent with the existence of evil. The best one hope to establish is that the existence of such a god is highly improbable given the existence of evil.
1.5.1.11. Pro: If a god can intervene in the compilation of a document, so as to finish a dead man's five books for example, and does not do so such that we have fake news; that God is not good.
1.5.1.11.1. Con: God may have sufficient reasons for permitting the evils you mention above. For example, such evils may be necessary to achieve the greatest logically feasible world, which an all-loving God would desire to create.
1.5.1.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.
1.5.1.11.1.2. Con: A prevalence of Truth will create the greatest possible world.
1.5.1.12. Con: The claim that an all-loving God would necessarily want to remove evil from the world is not self-evidently true.
1.5.1.12.1. Pro: Knowing one attribute about a being will not necessarily act as a predictor for all that being's actions or opinions.
1.5.1.12.2. Pro: It is possible for an omnibenevolent God to tolerate evil in some sense.
1.5.1.12.2.1. Pro: "Could" and "Would want to" can coexist with "Shouldn't." It is entirely possible for a creator to see evil as bad, and to even have the urge to remove it, while at the same time concluding that it isn't best. Explanations could range from evidence suggesting that struggle is a prerequisite to greatness; to God's commitment to property rights and voluntarism. From a socialist viewpoint, it would be found difficult to fathom a leader who is ethically-opposed to intervention. I differ, so I don't.
1.5.1.12.2.2. Pro: No part of being a monotheistic god requires omniscience in a sense which cannot positively preclude preventing all forms of evil.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1. Pro: Even if God was omniscient and all powerful, we have proofs to suggest it is not necessary for Him to prevent all forms of evil because other aspects of His nature may prevent this. God is much more complicated than that. He is not restricted to pure retribution theology.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.1. Pro: God can turn evils into greater good.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.2. Pro: God can use suffering to bring us into a submissive state so that we seek him and His help.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.3. Pro: The existence of "evil" is necessary to be able to demonstrate the quality of mercy.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.4. Pro: The existence of evil is necessary for the existence of free will. A good God may have wanted some things \(i.e. people\) to have free will.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.4.1. Con: If God created the universe from scratch, then he invented the notion of free will, including its attribute of requiring the capacity for evil. Unless you suggest God was forced to create humans or free will in a very particular manner by some outside force or constraint, this doesn't prevent God from being culpable for the evil acts of his creations.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.4.1.1. Con: The existence of free will may be a great enough good that it was worth the necessary potential for evil to exist.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Free will itself is often accepted as a good thing by itself alone.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Free will is necessary for mercy to exist.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: The existence of free will may be necessary for the existence of other good things.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Love couldn't exist without free will.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: With love, comes pain.  With great love, comes great pain.  With love, comes a kind of entanglement of souls, what happens to one, happens to the other.  With these in mind, love is not a free, boundless state.  By its very nature, love has boundary conditions that challenge presumptions about the freedom of the will.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Love couldn't come about if there wasn't a choice at least initially. No one can be forced into it. It wouldn't mean anything if there wasn't another option.
1.5.1.12.2.2.1.4.1.2. Con: Considering an act to be "evil" requires, at the least, a divine moral arbiter to make the act evil. If such an entity exists, his actions could only be evil if he declares them to be so himself.
1.5.1.12.2.3. Pro: It has not been demonstrated that omnibenevolence must be defined so as to be logically inconsistent with permitting the presence of any kind of evil for any duration. As it stands, the inconsistency is tautologically assumed, not explicitly demonstrated.
1.5.1.12.2.3.1. Con: Our world is not simply one in which some forms of evil are present in small durations, but one in which evil is widespread. Inductively, we are therefore warranted in finding this incompatible with omnibenevolence.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2. Pro: I have a nail in my tire, I want to remove it, and I have the ability to remove it...but I do not remove it until the right time: after I arrive at the body shop. Just because God does not remove evil \(though He wants to\), does not mean that God contradicts Himself.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1. Pro: God may have [sufficient reasons](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.1113) for waiting to remove evil, such as allowing people to [develop virtues](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.1113+1960.512/+1960.512) or provide humans with [free will](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.38).
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.1. Con: If god is waiting to remove evil then god is not all good.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: If it is logically necessary, then an all-good God may still have sufficient reasons for waiting to remove evil. As long as this is possible, the problem of evil is not a logical defeater of the concept of God.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.4.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Omnipotence means that God can do anything \(any "thing"\). However, not all described actions are really coherent, and thus not really "things." For example, God cannot create a two-sided triangle, because such a described action is incoherent. Similarly, it may be incoherent for God to teach us certain virtues without without using evil. If so, then such a limitation would not contradict his omnipotence or goodness as traditionally understood.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.2. Con: Virtues are developed by example, not by punishment. Free will does not mean abusing choices. God gave me free will do do both good and evil, still I always make a better choice. If I make a bad choice, that is due to ignorance, and God may be held responsible for that.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.2.2. Con: Punishment may simply be the logically necessary result of engaging in a vice rather than a virtue.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.2.2.1. Con: This is obviously not the case as we ourselves are capable of forgiveness without punishment. This argument makes god less forgiving than the average human.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.2.3. Con: God may give us sufficient knowledge to be held responsible for certain bad decisions, or rewarded for good decisions. God may also judge us relative to the knowledge he gives us. "To those given much much is expected."
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.2.4. Pro: If we had supreme intelligence then we'd always make the right choices but since we don't then we can't be blamed for bad or uninformed choices.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.1.5.1.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.2. Con: You only remove that that nail "at the right time" because you are bound by physical and utilitarian constraints, such as the movability of the car. An omnipotent God would not find himself bound by such constraints. In your case, he could either decide that a\) the tyre was simply fixed or b\) given he is bound by neither space nor time, that the nail was never there. An omniscient God would have also foreseen the existence of the nail before it caused the issue and removed it.
1.5.1.12.2.3.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.12.2.3.2.1.
1.5.1.12.2.3.3. Pro: God "dealing with evil" in itself necessitates that evil exists to be dealt with.  Though Evil should be dealt with by a good all-powerful God, it must exist for a time before being dealt with. We are in that time before it is completely dealt with
1.5.1.12.2.3.3.1. Pro: Being powerful over something necessitates that the "something" exists. It is not only impossible, but contradictory to be powerful over something that does not exist.
1.5.1.12.2.3.3.2. Con: An all powerful God is not bound by space or time.
1.5.1.12.2.4. Pro: If God is all-good he should co-exist with evil since free will is of higher moral value than the absence of evil.
1.5.1.12.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.1.
1.5.1.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.1.
1.5.1.12.4. Pro: Maybe God loves Evil too
1.5.1.13. Con: It is possible for God to exist in the traditional sense and for evil to exist in the world because God is waiting to remove evil later.
1.5.1.13.1. Pro: God will completely eliminate evil for all eternity at Jesus's eventual second coming spoke of in Revelations.
1.5.1.13.2. Pro: This waiting before divine intervention is consistent with how God handled evil before the great flood and also before sending Jesus to Earth to cleanse our sins.
1.5.1.13.3. Pro: Since humans are not all knowing, all powerful, and all good like the traditional God, we cannot assert that we know the best way to deal with evil in the grandest sense. God currently permitting evil must somehow benefit humanity in the long run.
1.5.1.13.4. Pro: God waits to judge so more people are left [to make known to them the richness of His glory \(9:23\).](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+9&version=NKJV)
1.5.1.14. Con: This is ignoring other important aspects of God that explain why evil can exist. Like God being just and judge over the world. Man rebelled against God and we currently live in a world cursed with evil as punishment for our sin. Reducing God down to the the aspects above is logically flawed.  You can't remove elements of a being and then say the remaining aspects of the being don't make sense.
1.5.1.14.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.5.1.14.2. Con: God gave humanity the capacity to commit sin, knowing what could happen \(or even knowing the future\). Further, God has demonstrated the ability and willingness to intervene to prevent sins, impart direct instructions, or alter the physical world to cause or prevent harm. If he has failed to do so, one can only conclude the the "sinful" action of an individual is what God wanted to happen, and thus God is complicit in that evil.
1.5.1.14.2.1. Con: One mustn’t assume that sin = evil. In scripture, sin only equals separation from God in spirit, not necessarily an act of evil.
1.5.1.14.3. Con: Divine Justice only makes sense if you posit that justice as a concept supersedes God himself. If God defines what justice is in all cases, than justice is nothing more than his own whims. The only way to accurately say God is just, in the anthropomorphic sense, is to say that there is some cosmic standard of justice by which God himself is bound to which we as humans would recognize as just. Otherwise it is an inaccurate word to describe God's attitudes toward particular acts or motivations.
1.5.1.14.3.1. Con: Another alternative is to understand morality or justice as being logical entailments from the nature of God. On this account, it would be meaningful to talk about  divine justice without taking morality to precede God's will.
1.5.1.15. Con: There is [support](http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-grand-design.html) in quantum physics for something as fundamental as elements of our universe to take on seemingly contradictory states simultaneously. If this is plausible, then there is no reason to assume that God couldn't do so also.
1.5.1.15.1. Con: If you were to accept this assertion, you would have to accept that God is both good and evil at the same time, and thus different from the Judeo-Christian conception of an omnibenevolent God.
1.5.1.15.2. Con: There is no reason to think that the nature of God is analogous to quantum states.
1.5.1.15.2.1. Pro: There is a difference between contrary properties and genuine contradictions. Quantum states, as currently understood, seem to entail ascribing contrary properties to some natural phenomena. The three traditional properties of God and the existence of evil entail a contradiction.
1.5.1.15.2.1.1. Con: The lines between a contradiction and contrary properties blurs when considering [Spinoza](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-physics/)'s conception of God as nature itself, thus as an absolute natural phenomenon.
1.5.1.15.2.2. Pro: For an argument by analogy to be effective, the phenomena being compared must resemble one another in logically significant ways. There are no logically significant resemblances between God and quantum phenomena.
1.5.1.15.3. Con: Since God is omnipotent, claiming that God can possess contradictory properties involves claiming that anything can possess contradictory properties, and therefore involves abandoning the law of non-contradiction. This is not a tenable position.
1.5.1.15.3.1. Con: Anything can take on contradictory properties, pending its omnipotence.
1.5.1.15.3.2. Con: Omnipotence is itself a breach of non-contradiction.
1.5.1.15.3.3. Con: There are some versions of contemporary logic that do allow for some violations of the law of non-contradiction.  Graham Priest's [dialetheism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism/) is an example of this.
1.5.1.15.3.3.1. Con: Rejecting the law of non-contradiction in the case of specific types of sentences is not an unreasonable position. By contrast, rejecting the law of non-contradiction more broadly by claiming that any contradiction is possible is not a reasonable position.
1.5.1.15.3.3.1.1. Pro: Rejecting the law of non-contradiction would render us almost completely unable to make logically valid arguments.
1.5.1.15.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Quantum logic may be beyond the human scope of intellect, but being beyond the human intellect does not invalidate its potential to be correct.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gate)
1.5.1.15.3.3.1.2. Con: One need not reject the law of non-contradiction tout entirely. One simply needs to show that it need not apply to the properties of God.
1.5.1.15.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: If we understand god's traditional properties as entailing a problem similar to the problem of self-reference, then dialetheism may actually be a viable option.
1.5.1.15.3.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: There are at least some [ways](https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/7067/how-can-the-logical-impossibility-of-infinite-self-reference-be-reconciled-in-th) of construing the problem of evil that make it structurally similar to the problem of self-reference.
1.5.1.15.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.15.3.3.1.1.
1.5.1.16. Pro: For God everything is good but human interpretation puts an experience value in the good and evil axis
1.5.1.17. Pro: Benevolence is an essential feature of most monotheistic Gods. If it is not possible for a benevolent God to exist, then it is not possible for a God, in the traditional sense, to exist.
1.5.1.18. Pro: God is traditionally portrayed as being [maximally great](http://www.iep.utm.edu/ont-arg/), implying that he is all-powerful and all-knowing.
1.5.1.18.1. Con: God is a personal being, therefore reducing him to impersonal predicates like "maximally great" do the personal aspects of his nature an injustice.
1.5.1.19. Con: -> See 1.4.7.
1.5.1.20. Pro: If God can't conceive a world with free will and  without evil, God is not omnipotent, and if he is not omnipotent he is not God.
1.5.1.20.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.5.2. Pro: God would only make the best of all possible worlds, and the best of all possible worlds lacks evil.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Not just the existence of evil, but more broadly the issue of suffering is a major problem for the hypothesis of an omnipotent, loving god.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: The best possible world may still logically require the existence of evil and suffering. For example, the best possible world may include human beings with free-will, and free-will may require the possibility of choosing evil. Further, the best possible world may include the ability to make significant moral choices. Yet significant moral choices always involve the potential of suffering. Therefore, suffering may be necessary in order for people to make any significant moral choices.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.2.
1.5.2.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.5.2.2. Con: It remains to be proven that the best possible world must contain no evil. For instance, the absence of evil seems to preclude true freedom of choice for the individual, since otherwise it would be possible for individuals to choose evil. And if so, it must be weighed whether elimination of free will is an evil in itself.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: It must first be shown that freedom of choice really exists. Evidence is mounting that free will is at best an illusion. If free will does not really exist then there is no need for evil to guarantee freedom of choice.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: It is irrelevant whether free will exists or not - the possibility shows the existence of God can be logically compatible with the existence of evil.
1.5.2.2.1.2. Con: Since "evidence is mounting" we don't know yet, and this is a broad and complex discussion. Free will may be real and logical.
1.5.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See discussion #5685: There is no free will.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: A God that considers learning and making mistakes to be valuable experiences would not remove evil, because removing evil precludes these experiences.
1.5.2.2.2.1. Con: Evil from natural disasters is not learning from mistakes. Learning from mistakes means God as a pedagogue. There is no moral in suffering from natural disasters. A criminal has the right to know his crime. Punishment without judgement is a simple cruelty. God would have to provide explanation for natural disasters. That is the only way we can learn. Valid explanation for learning from mistakes may be karma and reincarnation, but not applicable here.
1.5.2.2.3. Con: Applying the principle of "Ignorance is bliss", a world full of people with no free will but no evil would be more benevolent than a world with free will and with evil. The meaningfulness of free will is not relevant to how benevolent a creator is, because this notion implies that the creator values his own philosophical enjoyment over the happiness of his creations.
1.5.2.2.3.1. Con: Perhaps the "greater good" in the creator's mind is not primarily the bliss of ignorance but is, instead, the love that could only be possible if free will exists. If we take the Christian God as our subject, we would understand that His goal would be to have a relationship with us that could only be meaningful by means of free will.
1.5.2.2.3.2. Con: Happiness is not a moral value in and of itself. The happiness of the created beings is not a relevant test for weighing the goodness of a world.
1.5.2.2.3.3. Con: If 1\) evil in the universe is temporary and 2\) good in the universe will be eternal, then the happiness of an infinite number of beings willingly good and knowingly better overtime over-weighs any type of logically possible ignorant happiness.
1.5.2.2.4. Pro: In the best of possible worlds people have free will and moral responsibility. These imply the existence of evil.
1.5.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.5.2.4. Con: Evil is a necessary component of any possible world which contains multiple people who have free will, thus even the best of all possible worlds must include evil.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: Evil is necessary for having a parameter to compare what is good for God´s existence. You can´t compare something out of an adverse reference, you can´t say that something is black if you don´t know what is white. Evil and God is the best bionomio of existence.
1.5.2.4.2. Con: While it might be that a certain degree of evil and suffering is necessary for any possible world, our world is characterized by excessive suffering.
1.5.2.4.2.1. Con: The criteria for "excessive suffering" is impossible to gauge. It is possible that even our experience of "overwhelming suffering" could provide knowledge and perspective that could prove to be a net positive, should for instance, there be an afterlife, and if this suffering would give us better perspective and knowledge to appreciate it.
1.5.2.4.3. Con: [Compatibilism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/) says that it is possible to believe in both free will and determinism. Therefore God could create a deterministic world in which everyone had free will, but no one did any evil.
1.5.2.4.4. Con: If the potential for evil action is necessary in the best possible creation, then Heaven must either be imperfect \(lacking free will\), or also contain the potential for evil action. Neither would be easily accepted in an Abrahamic worldview.
1.5.2.4.4.1. Con: Perhaps the "best possible creation" is more complex than you are considering. The creation wouldn't have to be constantly the same and could have different qualities during different time periods or phases.
1.5.2.4.4.2. Con: Heaven is completely God's initiative which lacks evil but arguably God has allowed the partial corruption of the world through human free will as the contribution to the make-up of our world which defers judgement from God to man who are to blame for imperfection.
1.5.2.4.4.2.1. Con: An all knowing all powerful god would necessarily realize the results of creating us the way he did, and would have been able to create us in a way that would grant us free will without the creation of evil.
1.5.2.4.4.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.5.2.4.4.2.1.2. Con: The idea that humans are autonomous identities and have free will without evil is arguably impossible. A creation which is without the ability to choose or not to choose God is arguably just an extension of who God is and not its own autonomous being.
1.5.2.4.4.2.1.2.1. Con: It is possible to have multiple good choices and no evil ones. This would allow for free will without the existence of evil.
1.5.2.4.4.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Free-will merely between good choices would lack significance \(e.g. choosing between multiple flavors of ice cream\). The capacity to make significant choices \(like self-sacrifice, or courageous action\) is plausibly greater than its negation, and significant choices require the possibility of evil and suffering \(at least any conceivable significant choice\).
1.5.2.4.4.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This is not necessarily the case. Choosing between two well suited romantic partners, or remaining single for emotional growth is an example of multiple good choices with significance.
1.5.2.4.4.3. Con: This is a false dichotomy, because once in Heaven, men \(and angels\) have willingly surrendered the possibility of doing evil \(disobeying God\).
1.5.2.4.4.4. Con: Monotheistic religions do not always require the existence of Heaven. For example, [Judaism](https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.638100) does not have a universal concept of Heaven.
1.5.2.4.4.5. Con: [Revelation 12.7 "There was war in heaven"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12%3A7&version=KJV). In the Christian Bible, Heaven has used its potential for evil long ago.
1.5.2.5. Con: A lack of evil is also a lack of comparative good. Such a world is essentially nothing. A world with evil triumphed over is best.
1.5.2.5.1. Con: No person has ever experienced the infinite nor the infinitesimal, yet people can know them solely through the finitude of experience. The comparative base for knowing evil is goodness, and that is all that is required.
1.5.2.6. Con: God as creator has set in motion the balance of the universe to allow "perceived evil".  One could assert that there was neither good nor evil but just consequences of balanced universe neither perfect or imperfect.
1.5.2.7. Con: God did create a perfect world in the Garden of Eden. Man's disobedience brought evil into the perfect world. We were our own downfall.
1.5.2.7.1. Con: The Garden of Eden was not a perfect world because the serpent was there too.
1.5.2.7.2. Con: Genesis 1 portrays a universe that was formless and void, a chaotic mix of 'waters'. 

As God began ordering the world, and filling it with creatures, it began to be good. 

At no point is it described as perfect.
1.5.2.7.3. Con: The micro-world of the Garden of Eden was not intended as a finality. Adam was told to be fruitful, multiply, and have dominion over ALL the earth, including the bits outside the garden.
1.5.2.8. Con: The real question if there's a providence or not. Good and Evil as agents in our world would have significant implications in regards to free will.
1.5.2.8.1. Pro: Leibniz stated that humans perceive good and evil, supposedly, but really our microscopic perspective leads us to perceive one corner of a painting as the whole of the canvas. An understanding of the breadth of space and time would lead to an appreciation of providence.
1.5.2.8.2. Pro: Providence could also be iterated simply as reason. The fact that the world functions through logical principles and those principles can be derived through human reason demonstrates providence and humanity's role in it as inseparable from reason.
1.5.2.9. Con: Leibniz was one to argue that evil itself is an illusion, that phenomena in the world appear to carry the modifiers "good" or "evil" but really one utilitarian providence is driving us towards good.
1.5.2.10. Con: The existence of evil is what allows God to redeem lost souls.  IF there were no concept of evil, there would be no need for redemption.  There would therefore be no need for Christ.  In the Christian tradition, the existence of evil is paramount to the existence of and belief in God.
1.5.2.11. Con: The premise that "the best of all possible worlds lacks evil" is unfounded. At best it is subjective or begging the question of what is "best", but may also imply that the person forming the statement is omniscient.
1.5.2.12. Pro: Making any world that is not the best of all possible worlds would be cruel, since it would result in less good. Since God is benevolent, God would create the best of all possible worlds.
1.5.2.12.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.5.2.13. Con: There is no grounds to assume evil would not be present in the best of all worlds. Best is relative.
1.5.2.13.1. Pro: If some good comes from overcoming evil, then the claim is false that the best of all possible worlds lacks evil because a world with more good would be one in which evil is overcome, adding extra good to the world that lacks in a world that is just good.
1.5.2.13.2. Pro: Perfection does not refer to anything real.
1.5.2.13.2.1. Pro: Perfection is a human-made category, that depends upon comparison with something imperfect for its meaning.
1.5.2.13.3. Pro: The amount of all possible concepts of a God are too broad to claim what kind of world he/she/it would create. The idea that it would necessarily create a world without evil is based upon the western image of a Christian god.
1.5.2.13.3.1. Con: The image of the Christian God referred to is a popular or a stereotyped version of God in christian theology.
1.5.2.13.3.1.1. Pro: In the Bible, in the book of Sirach it is written: "Good and bad, life and death, poverty and wealth, all come from the Lord." \(11,14\)
1.5.2.13.3.1.2. Pro: In the book of Job it is written: "If we take happiness from God's hand, must we not take sorrow too?". \(Job 2,10\)
1.5.2.13.4. Con: Most believers in an omniscient God also believe that God mandates objective moral standards of good and bad. So claiming that "best" is relative is not a viable defense for most believers in God.
1.5.2.13.4.1. Con: “Most believers” is a generalization without grounds, most believers could or could not treat this questions based on logic, or faith. This type of deniability of the concept “best” is weak.
1.5.2.14. Con: A benevolent God might create not just one good world but all possible worlds that contain more good than evil.
1.5.2.14.1. Pro: Positive human interactions overwhelm negative ones both in number and total duration.
1.5.2.14.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.6.3.
1.5.2.14.2. Con: A 'possible world' encompasses all that is - including God. God could shape it but not create it, nor can there be more than one. Claims invoking the creation of "multiple possible worlds" likely instead mean possible universes.
1.5.2.14.3. Con: A multiverse with all net-positive worlds could be strictly improved by replacing all imperfect worlds with perfect worlds. So there is no reason for God to create imperfect worlds.
1.5.2.14.3.1. Con: If a perfect world already existed, any new perfect worlds would be qualitatively identical to the first one, and would therefore be the same world. The only way to introduce distinct new worlds would be to introduce imperfections in order to make the worlds qualitatively distinct.
1.5.2.14.3.1.1. Con: It is possible to conceive of multiple identical worlds that are spatially and temporally distant from one another. Although they may have qualitatively identical goodness, they would be qualitatively physically distinct and thus not merely the same world.
1.5.2.14.3.1.1.1. Con: Given that the set of possible "good worlds" is strictly larger than the set of "perfect" worlds, this implies there must be duplication, and the same argument holds.
1.5.2.14.4. Pro: It is better for a world with more good than evil to exist than it is for that world not to exist. Therefore, a benevolent God would create any world with more good than evil.
1.5.2.15. Con: Then the best of all possible worlds restricts a free will to do evil.
1.5.3. Con: Logic may require that an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God permit evil in order to achieve the greatest feasible good. \(this claim assumes that even an omnipotent God must abide by logic, lest absurdities arise\).
1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.5.3.2. Con: By definition, omnipotence would allow for the creation of any possible outcome, and the ability to set all terms. By reason, any 'best' outcome must include an option for the omnipotent being where evil/suffering is non-existent as a variable and the 'best' outcome is achieved. All other possibilities on this line of thinking allow that the omnipotent being considers evil/suffering to be best, and back to the original argument.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.2.2.4.2.1.
1.5.3.3. Con: This is just a weakened form of the argument that humans are incapable of morally judging God. It has the same problem as the strong version, which is that a God who does things which are indistinguishable by humans from evil, is a God which is indistinguishable by humans from an evil God, but the traditional conception of God is not evil, it is knowably good. Thus there is a contradiction.
1.5.4. Pro: In order to be precise in this conversation, its necessary to differentiate between natural or impersonal evil \(natural disasters that kill, wild animal attacks, etc\) and personal evil \(human beings engaged in "evil acts" by something approximating free will\).  Each presents its own limitations to the God hypothesis.
1.5.4.1. Con: The most relevant evil is "personal evil" as that is one that is dependent on free will. Placing the responsibility of the consequences/evil back on the individual and community.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: By what metric do you find human willed evil the most relevent? Do you assume that natural evil is necessary for existence as we know it? What say you regarding the human propencity for addiction? Heriditary tendencies? Being at the environmental whims of birthplace? These must go into the moral calculus of any diety, no?
1.5.4.2. Pro: The existence of natural or impersonal evil cannot be explained by things like free will, or God's desire to test human goodness.
1.5.4.3. Con: The definition of natural or impersonal evil is not a priori.  A catastrophic event is neither good nor evil, whether that event be a tsunami, earthquake, etc.
1.5.4.4. Con: Evil cannot be helpfully defined as either natural or personal, since it is subjective and contextual.
1.5.4.5. Con: Due to chaos theory, it's difficult to determine the degree to which humanity contributes to the cause of natural disasters.
1.5.4.6. Con: Wild animal attacks may appear to be spontaneous acts of nature, but in reality they are significantly more prevalent in areas affected by [human habitation](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/01/over-1000-people-killed-india-humans-wildlife-territories-meet).
1.5.4.7. Con: Research in [Particle Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will_theorem) suggests that particles are not completely determined by their past events, meaning that the distinction between personal and impersonal evil breaks down.
1.5.4.7.1. Pro: [Process Theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_theology) is a theory of God that is compatible nature having radical free will.
1.5.4.8. Con: "Natural" evil is not evil at all because it does not have an intent behind it.  It is just a function of natural mechanisms.  "Personal" evil, while certainly terrible, is overcome by the "personal" good of the Creator and His created ones.  In a world of free will, evil must exist.  The amazing thing is not the existence of evil but that God overcomes it with good.
1.5.4.9. Pro: Evolution by natural selection is a process that entails the continual and indiscriminate suffering of conscious creatures locked in competition for finite resources - how pointless and capricious if designed by an all powerful god.
1.5.5. Con: God can only be omniscient in the sense that he can know the past in its entirety and the present in its fullness, but only the broad trends that will define the future, as the future is always at least partially indeterminate. If you understand temporality, you know that God does not "know the future" in any actual way.
1.5.5.1. Con: God, in my understanding, exists outside the confines of time.  temporal limitations do not apply to a being who exists outside of time.  From God’s perspective, all of time would be visible and accessible.
1.5.5.2. Con: There are many instances where God gives information of what will be i.e Joseph in Egypt interprets Pharaoh's dream indicating 7 years of good crops then 7 years of bad; Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar's dream indicating the decline and style of Kingdom's to follow his Kingdom.
1.5.5.3. Con: A god that does not know the future is not all knowing. A powerful god should be able to compute all possible iterations of the future.
1.5.5.3.1. Pro: Omnipotence implies omniscience. If you limit God's omniscience in any way you also limit God's omnipotence.
1.5.5.4. Con: God not only knows the future, but He has set it even from the beginning of time. Nothing happens outside of His Omnipotent will and design. Human history in its most minute details is past history even before Creation.
1.5.5.5. Con: God clearly has the power to change the "broad trends" of the future, since that is part of potence. If His knowledge does not extend to the knowledge of what He would choose to do in any circumstance that will actually occur, nor of what would result from that choice, it is not omniscience in any sense.
1.5.6. Con: God may have sufficiently good reasons for allowing prevalent evil, such enabling [virtues](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.512), [moral agency](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.38), or [others](https://www.kialo.com/is-the-existence-of-god-compatible-with-the-existence-of-evil-1960/1960.0=1960.1-1960.11).
1.5.6.1. Pro: If God's qualities are so immense as to expect him to be able to do something about all the evil in the world, then they are likewise immense enough for him to have to have knowledge of good reasons for allowing evil of which we are unaware and may never be aware.
1.5.6.1.1. Pro: Assuming that God is omniscient, it seems likely that he will have reasons for creation decisions that we will not understand.
1.5.6.1.2. Pro: Assuming that God is omniscient, our brains will be unable to replicate the decision-making process that God used to make decisions about his creation -- such as the decision to permit evil.
1.5.6.1.3. Pro: Assuming that God knows the future, he has access to data that we cannot access that be used to weigh the pros and cons of creating a world with suffering.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Temptations that can lead to wrong-doing have to exist because God needs to give his creation a choice to choose to love him or not. Otherwise the creation would have been built on a lie as the creation would have been forced to love him. \(Much in the same way a dictator forces his/her subjects to love them.\)
1.5.7. Con: If one accepts that this natural world and life are not the final state, and that there is \(supernatural\) life after death, the existence of evil in this world magnifies God's Omnipotence, Love, and Goodness. One can however only discover this by directing everything in life towards God, this brings about transcendence of suffering and evil and brings forth good.
1.5.7.1. Con: Given we only get one life on earth, and we know that very few people end up transcending suffering, one is probably better off spending your time doing other things with a greater likelihood of success.
1.5.8. Con: Evil exists because we choose to break God's command individually and collectively
1.5.8.1. Con: Events that cause harm to humans or other animals can \(and do\) happen naturally and/or without any conscious being choosing to break God's command.
1.5.8.1.1. Con: Bodily harm does not equate with evil. Evil is synonymous to both immoral and malicious, both by definition having more to do with one's intent than the resulting outcome.
1.5.8.1.1.1. Con: If an omnipotent deity knowingly creates a system where bodily harm occurs regularly and cannot be avoided, it is reasonable to assume that said deity intended people to be hurt. This can be regarded as malicious.
1.5.8.2. Pro: Even natural evil is tied to the fact that mankind is given dominion over, and thus responsibility for, the earth. Because we are irresponsible stewards of the planet's health, we increase the likelihood of natural disaster beyond what is necessary under the laws of nature. Thus, even this evil is at least partly the result of mankind's choices, not God's. But since God promised the earth to mankind, it would still be evil for him to go back on his word, despite man's irresponsibility as steward
1.5.8.3. Con: Many actions that are clearly evil were canonically either forced by God or encouraged by Him.
1.5.8.4. Con: Even if this is true, it is still God's choice that earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen because people choose to break God's command. An omnipotent being could choose not to inflict these consequences on people.
1.5.9. Con: God's omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence, do not necessarily negate Evil. It's possible that in the face of Evil, God's omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence are given a more beautiful and attractive backdrop. It's possible for God to exist in a way that marshals even evil for good, while he takes no part in Evil itself.
1.5.10. Pro: Humans are created in the image of God.
So if humans are evil, God cannot be omnibenevolent.
1.5.10.1. Con: If humans have a capability for evil it may be argued that God has a capability for evil, but this only serves as support to his omnipotence and not as an argument against his omnibenevolence.
1.5.10.2. Con: God is above men, and men are below God. In this, they are different.
1.5.10.3. Con: God's giving men free choice for good is a result of, not a detriment to, His omnibenevolence.
1.5.10.4. Pro: If God creates humans, then those humans commit acts of evil, then by the transitive property, God is at least somewhat responsible for those evils.
1.5.10.4.1. Con: Committing an act is not transitive. By this logic, if I cross the street, and this has a butterfly effect which causes someone 100 miles away to die in a car crash, then I am complicit in that evil.
1.5.10.5. Con: Human beings are initially representative of the image of God, but because they may choose to do evil instead of good, they may thus become less like God than when they were first created. A human who consistently chooses to pursue evil becomes a twisted or corrupted likeness, only superficially like God.
1.5.10.6. Con: Humans are created in the image of God, not as copies of God. Thus they may easily have qualities that God does not have, as a result of other parts of their creation, such as them having been made from dust, which goes wasn't.
1.5.11. Con: One must first understand that the earth is a fallen world and understand that it is a testing ground. If evil didn't exist on the earth than it would be heaven. How disappointing would that be? Main point is that this is a fallen world.
1.5.12. Pro: If a being known as God is omnibenevolent,  which is  all-loving and infinitely good, then it would never allow any sort of suffering or evil intent. That would run counter to its purpose of existence \(decided by Itself\). It is either infinitely good and has the power to squelch all evil and suffering, -- or not. And since there is Evil and suffering in the world, then It is not infinitely good, nor all-powerful. No "lesson of greater good" would be justifiable or acceptable to Itself.
1.5.12.1. Con: The Being, that which nothing can be greater than, will, by definition, only create beings which are not Him.  Therefore, they are destined to make mistakes, otherwise they would be Him.  A world which has imperfections must exist, therefore evil and pain and suffering will inevitably exist in that world.  However, what is amazing is not that there is evil but that He makes a way to deal with that evil and even use it for the good of those who follow Him.  His benevolence overcomes evil.
1.5.12.2. Con: Evil and good can be thought of in the context of the value function of an agent. In this setting, there are an infinite number of potential value functions, many of which are in conflict with each other. An agent which maximized successfully the good of some subset of agents would also, by necessity, minimize the good of another subset of agents.
1.5.13. Con: There is no unambiguous definition of evil.
1.5.13.1. Con: There must be an unambiguous term set forth by God if there is to be punishment and reward in the afterlife as set forth in Scripture.
1.5.13.1.1. Con: Scripture has always been written by fallible humans
1.5.13.2. Con: The lack of a definition of 'evil' that has zero ambiguity in application does not even suggest that there is no thing that the term 'evil' points at.
1.5.14. Con: God is not always good from the personal,  human point of view.  God is good from the whole universe point of view .
1.5.15. Con: You can only really argue for a probabilistic version of this, not a logical problem of evil. How could someone with a limited understanding of God and no possible way to know that whatever evil exists does not in fact, provide an unforeseen greater good?
1.5.15.1. Con: If God is all powerful, then he can create said greater good without the evil.
1.5.15.1.1. Pro: Yes, He could create good without evil, but then by doing that He would also take away our freewill, and you can't have it both ways. "If a thing is free to be good it's also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having..." C.S. Lewis
1.5.15.1.1.1. Con: Evil is not limited to free will.
1.5.15.1.1.2. Con: Evil that comes forth from free will is often caused by a bad environment. Therefore, God is responsible for creating bad environments that support ill-use of free will.
1.5.16. Con: The nature of god does not necessitate the nature of god's creations to hold only none-evil potential.
1.5.17. Con: If the God of Classical Theism created another perfect being, that being would also be God, which is impossible, since there cannot be two Supreme Beings. Therefore any created being must be less perfect.
1.5.17.1. Con: There can be two supreme beings.
1.5.17.1.1. Con: To Assume that there can be two supreme beings is to defy they very premise of the initial argument, which is that there is only one supreme being.
1.5.17.2. Con: Failing to be omnipotent is not a defect.
1.5.17.3. Con: This argument is a red herring. Human beings could be less than perfect but still not be rapists, murderers etc. Or humans could be morally perfect but not omnipotent.
1.5.17.4. Con: A being could easily be morally perfect without sharing gods other qualities of omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence. Such might be ascribed to angels.
1.5.18. Con: On a metaphysical scale, benevolence may be defined in a way that incorporates the existence of evil.
1.5.19. Pro: If there is a God that knows all and created all, then everything that exists, is God's fault. Evil exists, so it would be God's fault. To place blame on any other action taken by anyone else, is to simply point out an extension of God's work. Therefore, there can not be an all good God as traditionally described.
1.5.19.1. Pro: An all knowing God can not create a person with free will without knowing what choices the person would make later on. So creating them, makes God responsible for their choices, because he could've made them differently, or not even at all.
1.5.19.1.1. Con: The value of free will is a detractor from the strict deterministic argument against gods existence from the presence of evil. If God is responsible for their evil, he is also responsible for their good, which may easily outweigh the evil, and thus justify their creation by a good god.
1.5.19.2. Con: Everything that exists from the omnitemporal perspective of God includes the beginning, middle, and end of a divine purpose within a natural universe. Therefore, the natural effects of evil are temporally irrespective of the positive effects of the universe, and so is the responsibility of evil.
1.5.20. Con: The evil exists because it originates of human activity. Human is made in choice and God must not protect him IF he chooses evil. Many people just don't understand that this step will have evil consequences..
1.5.20.1. Con: If god did not wish to create evil, then he would not have made a world in which evil was a requirement for free will. Either god isn't powerful enough to create such a world, or he wasn't benevolent enough to wish it.
1.5.21. Con: The implication, that Evil would not exist, if a omnipotent and omnipresent God would exist, is not a logical conclusion. To imply this, one has to Know the Goal of Creation and its implemented Possibilitys. So this Argument is false
1.5.22. Pro: The traditional monotheistic conception of God requires omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and omniscience.
1.5.22.1. Con: Monotheism does not preclude the existence of evil, insofar as some of the features of the traditional conception of God can be abandoned without rejecting the traditional conception of God in toto \(in its entirety\).
1.5.22.1.1. Pro: Good and evil may not be relevant to God's view of creation.  She may have simply created. What we do with that creation and what meaning we assign to our actions and their consequences might be entirely human.  In this model, God created neither good not evil - just created.
1.5.22.1.2. Pro: The problem of evil proposes that a God can exist with evil but with certain qualifiers, namely that God is not all powerful, benevolent, or omniscient. If God does not by definition have to be all three of those traits, then the argument that God and evil cannot exist fails.
1.5.22.1.2.1. Pro: It is possible that God is not all powerful, and that evil has equal or more power than him. If so, he can still be all good & all knowing.
1.5.22.1.3. Pro: The problem with the supposition of the "OmniGod" is that it leaves no wiggle room for God to act in anything other than a single prescribed course. What about a non-interfering God? Or one who uses this world to test or forge people into better people? What are we calling evil? And is evil everything that causes humans pain? Or is evil a directed act of harm? Maybe an OmniGod created the conditions for utopia to watch what his creations did and maybe "evil" is a word thrown around too lightly.
1.5.22.1.3.1. Con: A maximally great being will always do the best-action iff \(if and only if\) there is only one best-action in a given circumstance. However, there may be many equally best-actions that God could choose between \(perhaps an infinite number\). Thus, a maximally great being is not left to a single prescribed course, since he can still pick between many equally-best options.
1.5.22.1.3.1.1. Pro: For example, it could be an equally best-action for God to make the planet mercury rotate clockwise or counterclockwise around the sun.
1.5.22.1.3.1.2. Con: Who gets to define "maximally great" and "equally best"?  By what standard do we get to judge that "maximally great" being? Is it what's best for the universe at large? Or is it strictly what's nicest for humanity?
1.5.22.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Maximal greatness and "equal-bestness" are determined by logic. However, logical propositions have a potentially infinite number of entailments, so only an omniscient person would be capable of determining the greatest action\(s\) in a given circumstance. Human beings, however, can make probabilistic determinations based on the knowledge we have at our disposal \(e.g. through the study of axiology, or values\).
1.5.22.1.3.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.1.1.
1.5.22.1.4. Con: Treating your faith as modular and cherry picking parts of it to keep the existence of God protected from criticism is an erroneous discussion tactic. Thus making your statement false.
[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking)
1.5.22.1.4.1. Con: Using an erroneous discussion tactic does not necessary prove that a concept is false. For example, a defense attorney could use a bad argument to defend an innocent client, but that does not mean that the client ceases to be innocent.
1.5.22.1.4.2. Con: Most of us treat most of our beliefs as modular inasmuch as if a part of it becomes untenable as we learn, we jettison it. That is how our scientific body of knowledge works as well.
1.5.22.1.5. Pro: There is a traditional conception of God \(represented from Neoplatonists through theologians representing all 3 Abrahamic faiths, to the present day\) that resolves the conflict of evil and God by assigning creation to the demiurge. They deny that God is omniscient or omnibenevolent, or even anthropomorphic. This conception posits a godhead which is utterly unknowable and can only be described as the source of being. While this presents it's own set of issues, it addresses the parent claim.
1.5.22.1.6. Pro: Given the nature of an omnipotent God, God's act to remove evil could unfold over time from our perspective. This means that the existence of evil is temporary and not contradictory.
1.5.22.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.5.1.3.6.3.
1.5.22.1.6.2. Pro: Most monotheistic religions believes that there will be a time where evil will be cast out.
1.5.22.1.6.3. Pro: The temporary evil on Earth does not compare to the goodness of eternal life.
1.5.22.1.6.3.1. Con: Eternal life is an incomprehensible concept, and something used fairly arbitrarily and without thought.
1.5.22.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Anything eternal would become horribly boring to most after about 60,000 years. Living a really long time is something I imagine a lot \(if not most\) people could get behind, but actual eternity is a different matter.
1.5.22.1.6.4. Con: The evil of the world is contradictory because an omnipotent and omniscient god would know the outcome of all choices ever to be made, which would show intent.
1.5.22.1.7. Pro: If we assume God to be the biblical being called God, then God is widely described as having a fully human nature in which there is a large benevolence but dark sides as well, similarly to any god in history from almost any religion. God intrinsically needs a dark side because we as humans cannot fully conceive goodness without any evil.
1.5.22.1.8. Pro: "God" is an elasic concept. Manichean dualism inherent in most modern monotheistic religions posits an evil deity of almos coequal power that somehow is a'permitted' to run rampant as a 'test of faith.' The original hebrew tribal 'YHVH" was not a 'loving father', but a stern war god.
1.5.22.1.9. Pro: "Omniscient" may have many meanings. For the claim above to be meanjngful, it would require not only that God knew all actualities, but that he knew all possibilities at all times in all aspects at all times. Mathematically, this is like the difference between 100 and 2^100 - but of course with the number 100 replaced with a far bigger number, making the difference even larger.
1.5.22.1.10. Pro: Our definition of evil is not necessarily God's definition of evil. Thus, we do not know if evil truly exists. However, this just allows for the existence of a God that humans do not necessarily want, who, for example, defines torture and pain and good.
1.5.22.1.10.1. Con: If one does not know if evil truly exists, then one must also not know if good truly exists. Hence it may be that an omnibenevolent monotheistic god is necessarily also omnimalevolent.
1.5.22.1.11. Pro: God does not need to be omnibenevolent to have omniscience and omnipotence.
1.5.22.1.12. Pro: The traditional concept of God might not require omnibenevolence.
1.5.22.1.12.1. Pro: The idea that God is only good is wrong. He is both good and evil. God encompasses all things. [biblehub.com](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-7.htm)
1.5.22.1.12.2. Pro: Omnipotent, Omnipresent and Omniscient are Characteristics of God. Omnibenevolent is not. Wise and Just are also characteristics of God. In which case to be just those who have done evil must answer for it, "...Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." \(Romans 12:19\). That won't be pleasant?
1.5.22.1.12.3. Pro: God is traditionally conceived as omnibenevolent, or "all-good", but the concept of "good" isn't universal and depends on your set of ethics.  My personal theory is that God was originally conceived as the ultimate force of justice or karma -- an embodiment of justice ethics.  Good deeds are rewarded, bad deeds are punished.  Whether evil can exist or not isn't God's concern.  Rather, it's the choices people make that lead to good or bad consequences, which are at God's discretion.
1.5.22.1.13. Pro: Since humans are limited in their capacity to conceptualize God then it's highly possible that our assumptions that God is all good, all knowing and all powerful are wrong.
1.5.22.1.13.1. Con: This is a red herring. It doesn't help to show that the existence of God is incompatible with evil.
1.5.22.1.13.2. Con: The God in the opening statement is all knowing and all powerful. Stating that we might be wrong by stating that he is is like saying that we have a false opening statement.
1.5.22.1.14. Pro: What exactly is the traditional conception of God? God might not be the opposite of evil, as the argument principally implies. So they might coexist.
1.5.22.1.15. Pro: Incorrect. There could a malevolent god who likes sin and seeing people suffer.
1.5.22.1.16. Pro: It is all God. Isaiah 45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.
1.5.22.1.17. Pro: If such a powerful being exists, then the idea that he even cares what we do to each-other is a massive assumption, and may not be true.  In which case, a god may exist, but they may not be the same one as traditionally conceived.
1.5.22.1.18. Pro: The postulate is a simplistic premise based upon classical academic constructions. God to be God only has to have one characteristic, ultimate power.  There is a vast difference between ultimate power and omnipotence.
1.5.22.1.19. Pro: The two causes can be mutually exclusive. God does not have to be all good by our definition in order to exist, as one or as many. Just as man can sometimes choose a lesser of evils, so could a single God who knows all.
1.5.22.1.19.1. Pro: God may be an immoral or amoral being
1.5.22.1.19.1.1. Pro: Traditional conceptions of God include ones where God is not omnibenevolent. Therefore, God might be amoral—permitting, facilitating, and honoring evil. For example, Lot's wife is turned to a pillar of salt for the crime of looking back. [Gen 19:26.](http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0119.htm#1)
1.5.22.1.19.2. Con: An all powerful God does not have to settle for the lesser of two evils .Thus the analogy that evil exists because it's better than another possible universe is a poor argument. If evil exists, it's because God is not either not all good, not all powerful, or not all knowing.
1.5.22.1.20. Pro: The existence of evil and monotheism are not mutually exclusive unless you begin discussing the qualities of a specific god.
1.5.22.1.20.1. Pro: Monotheism, by itself, does not require defining God in terms of maximal greatness. Yet, without that criterion, any number of lesser deities comport with the existence of evil. Ex., deism, open theism, finite godism \(see, Kushner\), panentheism, etc.
1.5.22.1.20.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.22.1.17.
1.5.22.1.20.3. Pro: Different belief systems have different ideas around what God could be and couldn't be. Even within one religion, conceptions of God may differ greatly.
1.5.22.1.20.4. Pro: Evil can coexist with a monotheistic God that is evil.
1.5.22.1.20.4.1. Pro: God \(the Christian God, that is\) consigns people to eternal suffering for no other reason than they belonged to the wrong religion.  Eternal suffering is an infinitely greater evil than any of us are capable of inflicting on our fellow beings.  Therefore, God is more evil than any other being, and his existence is perfectly compatible with the existence of evil.
1.5.22.1.20.4.2. Pro: In Abrahamic monotheism, God is good. But he has created a universe where his omniscience knows evil will inevitably happen and not using his omnipotence to prevent it. This therefore makes himself evil and thus cannot be God. Any theological argument that the Devil didn't create the Universe is illogical. The only possible alternative identity of this evil omniscient, omnipotent creator is therefore the Devil. Anybody who worships 'God' is instead actually giving praise to this Devil entity.
1.5.22.1.20.4.3. Pro: The traditional conception of God is of a being that is evil, because condemning people to limitless unending torment in hell is evil. The traditional concept of God is of a being that sends diseases and misfortunes to test or improve humans - acts which are in themselves evil \(the ends does not justify the means when the means themselves are evil\).
1.5.22.1.20.4.4. Pro: If God is omnipresent and omnipotent, then evil is a part of him, and he cannot be all good.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.1. Con: Two ideas contradict this claim: 1. Cibernetics: in any given system, big enough, there it will always be possible to have two contradicting theoremas that are both right. 2. Evil is only a pawn. Hence there is no contradiction. Other then that, this claim i am cons-ing now is a bit blurry. It needs precision. It has too many posible attackable fronts.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.1.1. Con: Whether evil is a pawn or not, it exists within god and therefore he is not all good.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.2. Con: Presence does not entail integration. I can be present in a room without being part of the room. Likewise, I can be in the presence of a person without being part of them.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.2.1. Con: Omnipresence does entail integration. You can be present in a room without being part of the room because you are not omnipresent.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.2.1.1. Con: There is no good reason to believe that omnipresence entails integration.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.2.1.1.1. Con: integration is a necessary requirement for omnipresence. If god is not integrated in everything, then he is not everywhere.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: This is begging the question, for it uses the matter asserted to prove itself.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.2.1.1.2. Con: If god isn't within everything, then god isn't everywhere.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Being within something doesn't entail integration. For example, I can be within a vehicle but not part of the vehicle. There is no reason to think this changes when omnipresence is concerned.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Omnipresence requires that god exists within each and every atom that is in existence.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This does nothing to show that presence within something requires integration with that thing.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.3. Con: Omnipresence is not a quality of the deity as traditionally conceived. Omniscience\(all knowing\) yes; omnipresence \(being everywhere\) no. The teaching that God is present \(immanent\) in all things is pantheism. It is a belief that has found acceptance in groups since antiquity, but is explicitly labeled heretical by the Roman Catholic Church.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.4. Con: Non sequitur: one thing doesn't imply the other.
1.5.22.1.20.4.4.5. Con: The meaning omnipotent in this context is all powerful. Evil is not a power but rather the individual and collective choice to break God's commandments.
1.5.22.1.20.4.5. Con: Good and Evil in this context is in reference to God itself. If there was an evil God, what we understand as good would be that evil, and we would perceive as good the contrary.
This means that, if the traditional God exists, we inherit from Him the perspective of what is good or wrong, in other words: we valuate those accorthing to Him and what brings us nearer to His will. So giving His existance for granted, his will and actions would be what we would consider right or wrong.
1.5.22.1.20.4.6. Con: If God was evil, God would create a maximally evil world. Since some good exists in the world, an evil God cannot exist.
1.5.22.1.20.4.6.1. Con: By this reasoning, since some evil exists in the world, a good god cannot exist.
1.5.22.1.20.4.7. Pro: Monotheism and evil are opposed only if you think of God as good. If so, evil can't come from God.
1.5.22.1.20.4.7.1. Pro: Monotheism suggest that the fabric of the universe is unified in the most fundamental sense; it suggest that God must be something and everything all at once. Thus, while good may be part of God, so too may evil be a part.
1.5.22.1.20.4.8. Con: God's enemy, the Devil, is responsible for evil, so both can exist.
All three major monotheistic religions \(Islam, Christianity, and Judaism\) have a Devil figure, who's working against God.
1.5.22.1.20.4.8.1. Con: A supreme and omnipotent God must not have a true enemy; he would simply not allow/conceive its existence. Unless he purposely creates a true enemy \(to "mess" with his creation, which is perfect, generating imperfection and disorder beyond his control\). The latter hypothesis seems extremely incoherent in any sense.
1.5.22.1.20.4.8.1.1. Con: When God created Angels he too gave them free will, this means that they had the ability to choose evil and some did so. And he would not interfere for preserving the sanctity of free will.
1.5.22.1.20.4.8.2. Con: While many versions of monotheism do imagine an evil being, to truly be monotheistic, they have to imagine that supremely evil being as less powerful  than the supremely good being. Nor is the devil imagined as a creator of the universe. Thus, God would still seem to allow and be the ultimate cause of evil.
1.5.22.1.20.5. Pro: Evil can coexist with a monotheistic God that is not omniscient.
1.5.22.1.20.5.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.18.
1.5.22.1.20.6. Pro: If God is merely the ["unmoved mover"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover) or "the first cause" in the long chain of cause and effect, evil could have arisen well outside the scope of God's influence.
1.5.22.1.20.6.1. Con: An omnipotent God would be able to predict the exact results of the manner in which he "first moved" the universe, and would choose that manner accordingly.
1.5.22.1.20.6.2. Con: All religions claim that God still has some capacity to affect the world.
1.5.22.1.20.6.3. Con: If God has been totally impotent ever since initially creating the universe, there is not much point in claiming that a God exists, as opposed to simply claiming that a Big Bang or some other initial cause exists.
1.5.22.1.20.7. Pro: A God that is "being itself" would encompass all things, good and evil alike.
1.5.22.1.20.7.1. Pro: The Cosmic Buddha Dainichi, a being who constitutes the entire cosmos of [truth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kukai/#HosSepBudCosPreDha), coexists with good and evil.
1.5.22.1.20.7.2. Con: If God just is everything, then saying "God exists" is meaningless - it is simply the tautological statement that "everything that exists, exists."
1.5.22.1.20.7.2.1. Con: The statement is not that "God exists", but that "all that exists is God". Scientists claim that everything, matter, even space itself are forms of energy, which cannot be created or destroyed. God, or the E in E = MC2, is not tautological, it's a unifying superset.
1.5.22.1.20.7.2.1.1. Con: There are good reasons to believe that "sets" are useful mathematical fictions, but do not actually exist, since use of sets leads to contradictions when applied to certain infinite quantities. Thus, if "God" is merely a superset, then this may mean he is likewise a useful mathematical fiction, but does not actually exist.
1.5.22.1.20.7.2.1.2. Con: There cannot be a set for which "everything that exists" is a proper subset, since that set and all its elements would then exist, and it would therefore be identical to the set of "everything that exists."
1.5.22.1.20.8. Pro: An amoral God would not preclude the existence of evil.
1.5.22.1.20.9. Pro: Evil can coexist with a monotheistic God that is not omnipotent / omnipresent.
1.5.22.1.20.9.1. Pro: If God was all-powerful, We wouldn't have any power.
1.5.22.1.20.9.1.1. Con: This does not contradict the parent claim. It actually concedes that one of the divine attributes \(power\) cannot exist, which upholds the parent claim.
1.5.22.1.20.9.2. Pro: Evil is the absence of God.
1.5.22.1.20.9.2.1. Pro: "Existence of evil" sounds as if "evil" would be an existing thing. But in some philosophical traditions "evil" is the absence of being \(the "not-stuff" that is outside of God\). God does not take "it" away because if he would, he would take away everything that is outside of him \(including us, since we\(or most of us\) are not yet God-like - we have nothingness inside of us \(absence of patience, of love, of truth, of will etc.\).
1.5.22.1.20.9.2.2. Pro: Evil being the absence of God is a play on words. It's the absence and rejection of God's line of thinking and moral standard.
1.5.22.1.20.9.2.3. Pro: It is very easy for us to say that one thing is good and that another is better. It is also easy for us to say that one thing is bad and that another things is worse. We do the later all the time in all the legal systems that have ever existed. Bad actions are given criminal punishments. And worse actions are given longer or harsher punishments. If we can differentiate between these things, we can say that they exist on a continuum. That means that you can frame them in relative absence of God.
1.5.22.1.20.9.2.4. Con: Omnipotence, omniscience and omnibenevolence is general taken to entail omnipresence as well.
1.5.22.1.20.9.2.5. Con: Thus, the triumvirate of omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and omniscience seems to invalidate the existence of evil since its existence would imply the existence of something or place which was not the possession of nor permeated by God.
1.5.22.1.20.9.2.5.1. Con: This only applies if evil is the total absence of God. If evil is only the relative absence of God, then this doesn't work.
1.5.22.1.20.9.3. Con: A God that is not omnipotent or omnipresent is not God as defined in monotheistic beliefs.
1.5.22.1.20.9.4. Con: -> See 1.5.1.18.
1.5.22.1.20.9.5. Con: God is traditionally said to have created the universe. A being with the power to create something out of nothing would have the power to prevent instances of evil on Earth.
1.5.22.1.20.10. Pro: Evil can coexist with a monotheistic God that is not omnibenevolent.
1.5.22.1.20.10.1. Pro: Are God and the Devil really in different businesses? I have never thought so. Both are capricious, and deal in judgment of the recently deceased. Also, the constructs of Heaven & Hell are nearly identical. An eternity of anything is torture.
1.5.22.1.20.10.2. Con: This solves the problem for only a limited subset of monotheistic gods that are not omnibenevolent.
1.5.22.1.20.10.3. Con: It is possible that evil is a necessary part of existence created by a God that is otherwise omnibenevolent. A definition of benevolence could exist that takes into account the necessity of evil.
1.5.22.1.20.10.4. Pro: Whether or not the concepts of evil and a monotheistic God really do exist, their definitions do not exclude the other from being possible. There are multiple scenarios in which we can imagine both an evil and monotheistic god to exist. Therefore evil and some forms of monotheistic gods are compatible, but perhaps not all forms \(i.e, a truly benevolent one\)
1.5.22.1.20.10.5. Pro: Evil can coexist with a monothesitic God who is good in some respects and evil in some respects.
1.5.22.1.20.11. Con: All three major monotheistic religions claim that omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence are essential features of God.
1.5.22.1.20.12. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.13.3.
1.5.22.1.21. Pro: If one were to assume the Noah story is true, God changed his mind about his plan to eradicate his imperfect creation. Thus God is capable of regrets, mistakes, and it'd be false to assume he's omnibenevolent.
1.5.22.1.22. Pro: Although evil may exist in some form in monotheistic traditions, it is not understood as an equivalent force to good.
1.5.22.1.22.1. Pro: As long as God can bring a greater good from all evil, there is no contradiction between the existence of evil and an all-good God.
1.5.22.1.22.1.1. Pro: The existence of evil only does damage to particular notions about God and man that are not taught in the Bible. The glory of God is the ultimate good, and He sovereignly uses evil \(using secondary means\) in order to accomplish His good purposes for the good of those who love Him without Himself doing evil or doing violence to the will of the creature.
1.5.22.2. Pro: The ontological argument for the existence of God posits that the most perfect thing imaginable necessarily exists because a non-existent being would not be as perfect as can existent being.  Abandoning  any part of the traditional conception would be to abandon the ontological proof of God's existence. God would no longer be that which nothing greater can be imagined, because the thing with all perfections would still be imaginable and greater. 
[The Ontological Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument#Anselm)
1.5.22.2.1. Con: Wrong. God can be greater than himself. Just as we grow from experience so can God. Process theological conception of deity preserves the ontological argument and omniscience: God knows everything there is to know.
1.5.22.2.2. Pro: Having all power, all knowledge and ever present as well as perfect in his character means there can be no new learning for God. The idea the God still has things to learn suggests he is not God.
1.5.22.2.3. Con: The thesis considers a hypothetical god with certain properties. The question of whether such a god actually exists is irrelevant to whether such a concept is logically consistent.
1.5.22.3. Pro: According to the Christian Bible, the Church is the pillar and foundation of truth \(1 Timothy 3:15\). The consensus of the Christian Church \(all major branches\) has concluded that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, and that these teachings can be deduced from Scripture. Therefore, Christians ought to defer to these teachings absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the contrary.
1.5.22.3.1. Con: The claim that God must be Omnibenevolent is a misunderstanding of God's character. The God of the Bible is holy and that's very different.
1.5.22.3.2. Con: 1 Tim 3:15 may actually refer to 'the living God' being the pillar and foundation of truth rather than the church.
1.5.22.3.2.1. Pro: There has been some debate among critics as to whether "the pillar and foundation of truth" in 1 Tim 3:15 refers to the church or to 'the living God'.
1.5.22.3.2.1.1. Pro: The 5th paragraph of Barnes' commentary given [here](http://biblehub.com/commentaries/1_timothy/3-15.htm) highlights that there has been debate about this:

"There has been no little diversity of opinion among critics whether this phrase is to be taken in connection with the preceding, meaning that "the church" is the pillar and ground of the truth; or whether it is to be taken in connection with what follows, meaning that the principal support of the truth was the doctrine there referred to - that God was manifest in the flesh."
1.5.22.3.2.2. Con: The church being the pillar and foundation of truth is the more natural reading of the passage.
1.5.22.3.2.2.1. Pro: This is remarked on by Barnes in his 5th paragraph [here](http://biblehub.com/commentaries/1_timothy/3-15.htm).
"The more natural interpretation certainly is, to refer it to the former ..." \[The church\]
1.5.22.3.2.3. Con: Bloomfield, who apparently knows Greek well, remarks strongly that the 1 Tim 3:15 does not lend itself to the interpretation that it means God is the pillar and foundation of truth. 

He says "It is surprising that any who have any knowledge or experience in Greek literature could tolerate so harsh a construction as that which arises from the latter method." \[That it means God is the pillar and foundation of truth\] 

See paragraph 5 of Barnes' commentary [here](http://biblehub.com/commentaries/1_timothy/3-15.htm).
1.5.22.3.3. Con: In this verse \(1 Tim 3:15\), the church being the foundation/pillar of truth refers to the church's existence and essence as a whole, rather than its consensus on particular issues. Thus this verse doesn't imply that omnipotent etc are true simply because of the church's consensus.
1.5.22.3.3.1. Pro: The last paragraph of Barnes' commentary from [here](http://biblehub.com/commentaries/1_timothy/3-15.htm) supports this view, saying:
"This does not refer, I suppose, to creeds and confessions, or to the decisions of synods and councils; but to the living spirit of truth and piety "in" the church itself."
1.5.22.4. Con: There is no explicit evidence in the Jewish Torah, the Christian Bible, and Islamic Koran of God being omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. These are only accepted conclusions made by theologians, not divine Word. God can exist with evil because these conclusions are false.
1.5.22.4.1. Con: Logically, if God is perfectly kind, forgiving, and compassionate, then God is omnibenevolent
1.5.22.4.1.1. Pro: mt 5:48 "Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect." AND
eph4:32"Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."
1.5.22.4.1.2. Con: Perfectly kind, forgiving, and compassionate still do not imply omnibenevolence. For instance, justice is an important trait possessed by God. To be kind or compassionate to one person often means to practice justice, which is not omnibenevolent to the criminal. This means that perfect kindeness, for instance, requires that there is some lack of "omnibenevolence" somewhere.
1.5.22.4.2. Pro: God would not need to be omnipotent, omnipresent and omnibenevolent in order to appear so to human observers. He simply needs to be powerful enough to trick humans.
1.5.22.4.3. Con: There are verses from all three holy books listed here which explicitly assert the omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence of God. See the Pros to this claim.
1.5.22.4.3.1. Pro: Omnipotence, from the Quran: "And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is over all things Competent" \(Aal `Imran 3:189\); "...We seized them with a Seizure of the All-Mighty, the Omnipotent" \(Al-Qamar 54:41-42\)
1.5.22.4.3.2. Pro: Omnipotence, from the Christian Bible: "with God all things are possible" \(Matt. 19:26\); "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth" \(Matt. 28:18\); "the Lord God omnipotent reigneth" \(Rev. 19:6\)
1.5.22.4.3.3. Pro: Omnipotence, from the Torah: "...behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee" \(Jer. 32:17\)
1.5.22.4.3.4. Pro: Omniscience, from the Quran: "He is Knowing of all things.... Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the All-knowing, the Wise." \(Al-Baqarah 2:28-33\); "\[He is\] Knower of the unseen and the witnessed; and He is the Wise, the All-aware" \(Al-An`am 6:73\)
1.5.22.4.3.5. Pro: Omniscience, from the Christian Bible: "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father" \(Matt. 10:29\); "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world" \(Acts 15:18\)
1.5.22.4.3.6. Pro: Omniscience, from the Jewish Torah: "...the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts" \(1 Chr. 28:9\); "The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good" \(Prov. 15:3\)
1.5.22.4.3.7. Pro: Omnibenevolence, from the Torah: "He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he" \(Deut. 32:4\); "As for God, his way is perfect" \(2 Sam. 22:31\); "Every word of God is pure" \(Prov. 30:5\)
1.5.22.4.3.8. Pro: Omnibenevolence, from the Christian Bible: "your Father which is in heaven is perfect" \(Matt. 5:48\); "for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man" \(James 1:13\); "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all" \(1 John 1:5\)
1.5.22.4.3.8.1. Con: This does not prove "omnibenevolence", except perhaps as a tautology. There is no darkness in Him, but light to a criminal is not omnibenevolent.
1.5.22.4.3.9. Pro: Omnibenevolence, from the Quran: "Allah is, to the people, Kind and Merciful" \(Quran 2:143\); "Whatever reaches to you of good, is from Allah, but whatever befalls you of evil, is from yourself" \(Ayahs 4:79\);
1.5.22.4.4. Con: If God were not all-powerful, he would not be "God", but "a god" and thus not a monotheistic god.
1.5.22.4.4.1. Con: The New Testament declares that God is Love [\(1 John 4:8\)](http://biblehub.com/esv/1_john/4.htm). The assertion is that Love is a sufficient definition of God, who does not also need to be all-powerful.
1.5.22.4.5. Con: The Bible claims that there is none above God. [Ephesians 1:19-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1&version=NKJV)
1.5.22.4.6. Con: The Bible claims that God is omniscient. [Psalm 147:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+147%3A5&version=NKJV)
1.5.22.4.6.1. Con: The Bible does not claim this. Psalms 147 is poetry.
1.5.22.4.6.1.1. Pro: The Psalms are a collection of songs. They express the emotions of multiple writers both in relation to their life and in their relation to God. To read these as assertions of fact is to ignore the genre of the text, it's use and the intent of the author.
1.5.22.4.7. Con: The Bible claims that God is good. [Psalm 106:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+106%3A1&version=NKJV)
1.5.22.4.7.1. Con: Being much removed from the language and culture of ancient Israel we cannot truly understand their conception of "good."
1.5.22.4.7.2. Con: God's goodness is not the sort of goodness which precludes his actions as a just and holy God.
1.5.22.4.8. Pro: It's a category mistake to equate expressions of God's omni-ness with God's actual nature. 

If I call my wife "The most beautiful woman in the world"... I'm not making a claim about objective fact. I'm expressing something about our relationship. 

This is how biblical claims of God's almighty power work also. They express the feelings of the author.
1.5.22.4.9. Pro: The concept of God as omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient was introduced to Christianity via [Neoplatanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism_and_Christianity) - long after the completion and canonisation of the New Testament.
1.5.22.4.10. Con: The monotheistic deity described in the Quran is given names such as "The Absolute King", "The Greatest" , "The Giver of All", "The All-Knowing", "The Seer of All", "The Highest", "The Truth", "The All Powerful", and "The One".
1.5.22.4.10.1. Con: None of these terms imply "omnibenevolence".
1.5.22.4.11. Con: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.1.1.5.
1.5.22.4.12. Pro: "Omnibenevolence" is not mentioned in the Bible. There is no requirement from any Bible passage which would imply that the Christian God must have benevolence which lacks justice, or that there would even be a good thing which lacks justice.
1.5.22.5. Pro: Monotheistic scripture logically implies omnipresence
1.5.22.5.1. Pro: rom 8:38-9 "...neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord." Note Greek here for Love: ἀγάπης
AND 1 John 4:8 " 8Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love" Love: ἀγάπη    \(the love is God, which is everywhere in the sense described\)
1.5.22.5.1.1. Con: Rom. 8 states that no external forces can separate an individual from the love of God. However, the individual can separate himself from the love of God by rebellion. John 15:10 "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love" implies that abiding in God's love is conditional on obedience. Likewise, Isaiah 59:2 asserts "But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear."
1.5.22.5.2. Con: "Monotheistic scripture" is too broad a claim. While for instance the Quran states \(50:16\) “And indeed We have created man, and We know whatever thoughts his inner self develops, and We are closer to him than \(his\) jugular vein.”, we do on the other hand have Jesus crying out on the cross that God has forsaken him. So "Monotheistic scripture" is divided on this point, not unified.
1.5.22.5.3. Con: 1 Kings 19:11-12 "...a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire". This seems to imply that God is not present in every natural phenomenon.
1.5.22.5.4. Con: Isaiah 59:2 "But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear." This implies that sin separates the individual from God, meaning He is no longer present with them.
1.5.22.6. Pro: Omnipotence follows logically from monotheistic scripture, not the mere authority of theology
1.5.22.6.1. Pro: mt 19:26 "with God all things are possible" logically implies omnipotence
1.5.22.6.1.1. Con: This implies capability, not omnipotence.
1.5.22.6.1.2. Con: The language of "possibility" speaks against omniscience.
1.5.22.6.2. Con: There are many passages in the Bible contradicting the exaggerated "omni" claims on God. Concerning omnipotence, my favourite is Judges 1:19, which states that «The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had chariots fitted with iron.»
1.5.22.6.2.1. Con: Another interpretation of this specific verse is that the men of Judah were intimidated by the chariots of iron, and their wavering faith disqualified them from receiving God's help that he would have given otherwise. A comparison is Peter walking on water; God had the power to cause Peter to walk on water, but withdrew that power when Peter doubted. The question is not God's ability, but the believer's faith.
1.5.22.7. Pro: The Abrahamic deity is commonly considered omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient. Here is evidence supporting this claim, [calvarychurch.org](http://calvarychurch.org/about-us/our-beliefs) .
1.5.22.8. Pro: A God to allow evil majorly lacks compassion in which case is simply not worthy of praise.
1.5.22.8.1. Con: Compassion is a human feeling based on human experience. Our suffering might not correspond to God's understanding of suffering. Maybe as God, suffering is unknown to It. God does not suffer, it is incompatible with Its very nature, Its godliness.
1.5.22.8.2. Con: In a Christian perspective, at the same time that God allows the existence of evil He offers salvation and help for those who want it and a eternal life of no evil at His side. All this is available to every human by His grace, what shows His compassion to humanity.
1.5.22.8.3. Con: Man is granted both conscience and free will, which makes him human; this enables him to choose between good and evil; Evil is caused by perseverance in the wrong choices and is punished by God; both in the afterlife as in the present; In essence there is no greater penalty than losing one's conscience, whereby man becomes beast and loses his humanity. God shows his compassion by postponing his judgment until after death.
1.5.22.9. Con: The traditional concept of God's benevolence is to be found in religious stories. In these stories, God is no fairy bestowing instant bliss, but rather uses temporary evils to teach his subjects by trials and tribulations. While these trials seem like evils along the way, they do in the end stand out as goods that were not recognised as such until the lesson they provided had been learned. Only a permanent evil that taught nothing would contradict God's goodness. That said, Hell is such an evil.
1.5.22.9.1. Pro: Even the evil of Hell is only contradictory as described above to the extent it is assumed to be permanent and uninstructive. If one interprets the gate to Hell as "locked only from the inside," then Hell must exist as a place where humans are simply allowed to continue tormenting themselves as they did in life, out of God's respect for free will. There they can serve as instructive examples of "what not to do," and perhaps they can eventually be enlightened to their own mistakes and set free.
1.5.22.10. Con: The notion of God as traditionally conceived could be in error, such that God lacks the power to block evil.
1.5.22.10.1. Con: This doesn't contradict the claim. If there was in error in the traditional conception of God, then God as traditionally conceived would not exist.
1.5.22.10.2. Con: If God lacks the power to block evil, then evil, by definition, is a separate entity outside the realm of God’s power.  There can be nothing outside the realm of a monotheistic God’s power.
1.5.22.11. Con: A God which is omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient may allow short term evil to exist if it benefits His creation in the long run, since from His eternal perspective finite evil is insignificant compared to eternity.
1.5.23. Con: God does not "allow" evil. Evil was created by the lesser creation which was in his image but not of his image. God does not promote evil as much as the idle mind of man forgoes worldly temptations.
1.5.24. Pro: Injustice among people with the same background and choices exists, thus a presumed just god, who provides free will could not exist \(e.g. baby dying in earthquake is stripped from its free will and options granted to others\).
1.5.25. Pro: Morals are not reliant on an outside supernatural deity. If an all powerful deity allows evil, suffering, and sadness on the scale that is commonly observed, then he is malevolent or uncaring, neither are worthy of worship.
1.6. Con: It is consistent to hold the view that God as traditionally conceived exists and that God is not the author of evil.
1.6.1. Con: According to the bible, God is the author of evil. [Isaiah 45:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+45%3A7&version=KJV)
1.6.1.1. Pro: The translation is correct
7:45
רָ ע ro
bad, evil, wicked, unkind.
1.6.1.2. Con: The context \(Isaiah 45:4-7\) shows that God created evil for Babylon for the sake of Jacob, i.e. Israel.
1.6.2. Pro: It is also logical. A certain individual gives everything the fish needs but does not dictate what the fish should or should not do. If we are able to do this as humans, the traditionally conceived God's can theoretically take the decision of not interfering at an incomprehensible scale in terms of knowledge-based-decision-making and so, God may choose to not interfere at all.
1.6.2.1. Con: In this 'aquarium analogy', the individual dictates the metes and bounds of what the fish may do.  This means it is made possible for both good and evil to be done. In creating Good, Evil is necessarily also created.
1.6.3. Con: If God is omniscient, omnipresent and the architect/designer of the universe, then there can be nothing in the universe he did not create directly or indirectly.  One might argue that the soul of man begot evil.  Yet the soul of man is of God. Therefore, evil was indirectly created by God, and/or He must have known that man’s soul would devise evil.
1.6.3.1. Pro: If God created man, and man created evil, then God created evil through man.
1.6.4. Con: Good cannot exist without Evil. If God created Good, then in doing so intentionally created Evil at the same time.
1.6.4.1. Pro: You can't draw on a white sheet of paper with a white pencil. There is no good without evil, as there would be no picture without black on white.
1.6.5. Pro: It is a direct consequence of giving some of His creatures free will that those creatures turn away from God, thus becoming evil. Evil is thus not a thing in and of itself, but an absence of something, an absence of the influence of God, Chaos.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Agreed. Evil in itself is part of free will. So as the opportunity to perform an act of free will, there is an influence of some sort. Just as there is an inflence to do good, there is one as well to do evil. Which is to say it is a struggle such as a adversarial engagement one influences more than the other, and yet free will is the balance between the two before engagement begin. For example: Genesis chap. two; creation of every tree, and one was the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
1.6.5.2. Con: Evil is not limited to free will. If the universe has a bad design that kills or tortures people, God is responsible for that bad design.
1.7. Con: Asserting that evil exists posits moral value. But there cannot be moral value without God.
1.7.1. Pro: Existential crisis due to evil actually proves the traditional monotheistic God. This identity crisis signals us toward moral and spiritual awareness \(not by building our identity, but explicitly making us aware of the deprivation of goodness\). We know what the world is \(unjust\) as opposed to what we are \(lovers of justice\). If I am truly a lover of justice, despite it's apparent absence, justice must still refer to some real subject because it is necessarily implied by the kind of thing I am.
1.7.2. Pro: The very assumption that certain things are good and others evil supposes the existence of a lawgiver. There cannot be moral obligation without the existence of God.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Absent an ultimate lawgiver, evil is merely a human construct. It does not make sense to use a human construct as an argument against God's existence.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: Assuming that God is a human construct as well, this is not necessarily true.  Assuming he is not, humanity was supposedly made in his image, and thus the judgement through human constructs is still valid.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: Here, "human construct" refers colloquially to refer to moral anti-realism: that is, the belief that there are no moral facts which exist independently of human observers.
1.7.2.1.2. Con: The "human construct" of evil is a description of certain facts about our world that we observe.  It makes sense to argue that these facts are inconsistent with the existence of an all good, all powerful god.
1.7.2.1.3. Pro: What makes something evil beyond mere human dislike? Any answer to that will render the entire problem of evil argument self-contradictory, using a criterion of good to contrast evil as real, when the point of the argument is that there can be no such criterion of good including a being that somehow embodies such a standard.
1.7.2.1.3.1. Con: The monotheistic tradition that's being discussed here gives many examples of evil beyond mere human dislikes.
1.7.2.1.4. Pro: In order to establish that evil actually exists, there has to be a moral framework to base the concept of evil on. If this is a purely societal adaptation, we have no basis upon which to call the practices of other societies evil.
1.7.2.1.5. Con: The argument of evil points out a potential inconsistency within the conceptual framework of monotheistic religion and does not necessarily have to address how meaningful a notion of evil is from a non-religious stand point.
1.7.2.1.6. Con: As humans we are limited to human constructs only. This would suggest that any inquiry to the nature of God is futile.
1.7.2.1.6.1. Con: Reductio ad absurdum:

1. All human beliefs are human constructs.
2. Human constructs cannot be trusted to communicate ultimate truth.
3. Premise 1 is a human belief. 
4. Therefore, premise 1 cannot be trusted as an ultimate truth \(1, 2, 3\)
1.7.2.2. Con: The existence of a lawgiver or a God is not what's being argued. It's an existence of a very specific kind of God that is omnipotent and omnibenevolent that is being challenged. Other Gods may very well exist.
1.7.2.3. Con: There is no power in divine moral obligations if everyone interprets them differently, or believes in different ones. In fact, avowed divine support allows the committing of acts of extreme atrocity by political establishments, and public opposition remains absent for fear of God's disapproval.
1.7.2.3.1. Con: Even if many people misinterpret divine moral obligations, they can still be real, and can still mean that certain things are good or bad.
1.7.2.3.2. Con: A difference of opinion on God's standard of good and evil doesn't mean that truth can't be found. Ignorance of a fact doesn't negate its validity.
1.7.2.4. Pro: Doesn't God help justify doing evil?  i.e. God says this person is subject to hell if they meet this criteria.
1.7.3. Pro: Without God, there is no objective standard of evil.
1.7.3.1. Con: If God is a person then his moral standards would still be subjective, just as they are with every other person. Objective moral standards do not require another person telling us what is right or wrong.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Then the problem of "evil" and God is only subjective. If evil to God is just what God wants to think of as evil, then there is no problem.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: False equivocation. Objective moral standards can exist, we just can’t say that we know that they are “objective” because God says so. Removing God from the equation does not plunge us into subjectivism, using a person as our source of authority does.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation)
1.7.3.1.1.2. Con: If morality is subjective to the human experience, it does not mean that objective moral values cannot exist. Objectivity is most contra-distincted by relativity, and not subjectivity. And subjectivity by the absolute, not the objective. Thus, objectivity does not require a grounding in the absolute and the absence of such a grounding does not show less objectivity simply because the phenomenon is also subjective.
1.7.3.2. Con: Objective moral judgement only needs universal 'good' values. For instance you could define evil as 'contrary to human rights' - which many people do.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Evil is defined subjectively as much as it is objectively. A monotheistic God who was omnipotent and omnibenevolent would not permit humans to live without providing timeless and unquestionable definitions of good and evil. As this species cannot know good from evil in all circumstances there is no God.
1.7.3.4. Con: There IS NO objective standard of morality. Therefore according to this argument ... is there no God?
1.7.3.5. Con: One could define evil as pain, suffering, or unhappiness. The existence of these things only requires the existence of humans, and does not require the existence of God.
1.7.3.5.1. Pro: Suffering can be subjectively bad without needing to be objectively bad.
1.7.3.5.2. Con: Pain, suffering and unhappiness are an invalid \(or too broad\) definition of evil \(e.g. I slipped and stubbed my toe so I am in pain, My girlfriend decided to leave me so I am suffering, The grocery store doesn't have my favorite ice cream so I am unhappy\). None of these causes would ever be mistaken as evil acts. This claim depends on this trivial definition of "evil", which is false.
1.7.3.5.2.1. Con: While the examples listed are examples of relatively trivial forms of "pain, suffering and unhappiness" there are also plenty of examples of non-trivial forms of "pain, suffering and unhappiness" \(consider the pain, suffering and unhappiness encountered in war, famine or during epidemics\). Similarly, it is possible to construct an account of evil that is relative, including some relatively trivial "evils" but also evils that are not trivial.
1.7.3.5.2.2. Con: Pain, suffering and unhappiness may not be evil by themselves, but allowing them to happen to others when you could prevent it \(even if it's by not creating humans in the first place\) is evil.
1.7.3.6. Con: Claims regarding the nature of right and wrong cannot be "objectively true" whether they come from a supernatural being or not.
1.7.3.7. Con: In practice, numerous cultures of a variety of faiths have managed to coalesce around certain predictable standards of acceptable behavior \(ie morality, laws, etc\). Thus it is possible to develop knowledge of morality without the "real God" revealing his desires.
1.7.3.7.1. Con: The fact that cultures have coalesced around certain standards of behaviour does not imply that those standards are objectively true.
1.7.3.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.3.6.
1.7.3.8. Pro: There is only evil because of the contrast between it and God.
1.7.3.8.1. Con: I can look at the actions of God, such as the demand that disobedient children be stoned [\(Lev 20:9\)](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Lev%2020.9), and determine that act evil. This is an evil act even though it is in line with God's demands, therefor evil is not defined by an contrast with God.
1.7.4. Con: God is not necessary for morality.  Just a being that has and exercises preferences.  We prefer to be chilled and don't care much for being stressed.  Those things that chill us are good, those things that stress us are evil.  Clearly our system of preferences does not point to any single divine creator because moral standards differ from place to place and they also evolve over time in the same regions.  There is no objective moral standard only different peoples with different preferences.
1.7.4.1. Con: When talking about minor morality issues surely there is little distinguishment.  However, when we talk about gross evil, that which we universally denounce, it is clear that evil exists and the materialistic explanation can provide no basis by which we may define something as truly evil, only preference.  If it is preference then there is no basis by which we can claim something wrong.  Yet we all recognize the difference between the greatly good and the terribly evil. God is necessarily true.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: This depends on the definition of good and evil. If we define good choices/acts as those that increase happiness or decreases suffering of sentient beings then we don't need god of any kind to establish moral value of any choice/decision. Much better than any religious morality system that has history of burning people at the stakes for blasphemy, witchcraft or apostasy.
1.7.4.1.2. Pro: Without appeal to an absolute authority, we cannot talk about good and evil in any meaningful sense; all that is left is fortune and misfortune, winners and losers.  Good and evil are value judgments, and what you consider evil I may consider to be good.  This difference cannot be resolved except by appealing to a standard outside of ourselves, and to an authority which upholds and enforces that standard.  That authority that upholds the standard you appeal to is effectively your God.
1.7.4.1.2.1. Con: It is entirely true that with no absolute authority good and evil are completely relative concepts and that by extension so is morality as a whole. There is no reason to resolve this ideology by appealing to a standard outside ourselves, as there is nothing to resolve in this ideology unless you already believe in such an absolute authority or standard outside of yourself.
1.7.4.1.3. Con: Yet we do not all recognize anything to be greatly evil. Not even genocide. Those that commit genocide consider themselves to be doing the 'greatly good' act. It is their poor victims and some observers that consider the event to be 'greatly evil'.
1.7.4.2. Con: If there is just one example of an act that is considered to be universally evil \(regardless of personal preference\), then there necessarily exists an objective standard \(a "law"\). Simple subjective preference is invalid as a standard for morality. Strict materialism cannot account or explain the existence of an objective "law" \(that which is violated through this evil act\). If there exists even a single objective "law" then there MUST be a lawgiver who is the ontological source of that "law".
1.7.4.2.1. Con: The thing about the Moral Instinct is that it comes with a mighty dose of Conviction. This is true for differing moral viewpoints as it is for commonly accepted viewpoints. It can be argued that this is reason for the God concept. God is a derivative of the Moral Instinct. How does one justify the conviction with which morality is felt? Ans: By creating an Authority figure to justify it. This creation is itself quite subconscious and is a result of the Conviction with which morality manifests.
1.7.4.2.2. Con: If there existed a single objective moral law, then it is true that there would have to be a lawgiver that was the source of that law. However morality is intrinsically relative and thus there is no objective moral law and by extension no act that is considered universally evil.
1.7.4.3. Con: Our intuition resists this claim, because it’s consequence is complete stasis: there is no ulterior motivation in pursuing good, and no motivation to resist evil.
1.7.4.3.1. Con: There is no need for an ulterior motive in pursuing the good. The Good is pursued for it's own sake. Our instinctive preference is what we term as good. Sitting on hot coals is bad. We do not need an ulterior motive to leap off the hot coals. The situation itself is not preferred. Humans are by Instinct moral creatures. We have scales of Preferences which we call our Moral and Aesthetic values.
1.7.4.4. Pro: Human beings have limited knowledge, and they cannot identify absolute good or absolute evil.
1.7.4.4.1. Pro: Where you say 'and', if you meant 'therefore' then I agree. And to take that argument to the next level... Since our morality is so indelibly tied to our epistemological state it follows that as knowledge evolves our morality evolves. Is abortion murder/evil? That depends on whether we know foetuses are sentient. if they become sentient after 6 months then abortion before then would be okay. If burning witches was a known means to salvage their immortal soul then it is a good act.
1.7.4.5. Pro: The idea of exactly "what" God views as good or evil changes over time and with culture, therefore it proceeds from cuture, not God.
1.7.5. Con: Contemporary moral theory suggests that moral standards can exist without God.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Certain actions can be immoral just because of their qualities. For example, torturing babies is immoral just because it involves the infliction of pain on vulnerable creatures without any good reason. Torturing babies is thus immoral independent of the existence of any moral lawgiver.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: This statement presupposes a moral framework including cruelty as wrong. It may feel wrong to torture babies, but that means nothing in terms of absolute moral obligation.
1.7.5.1.2. Con: This statements takes suffering as the basis for determining good and evil. It speaks of specific moral feelings, not of moral obligation. What about the cultures in which infant sacrifice was seen as necessary and felt right? What authority can you appeal to in order to tell them to stop torturing babies?
1.7.5.2. Pro: A [majority of philosophers](https://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl) believe that moral facts can exist even if God does not exist.
1.7.5.2.1. Con: Truth is not determined by majority opinion.
1.7.5.2.1.1. Con: Expert testimony is usually a good guide as to the truth or falsehood of a certain position.
1.7.5.2.1.2. Con: Neither is falsehood determined by significant minority
1.7.5.2.1.2.1. Con: No one has claimed that it is.
1.7.5.2.1.3. Pro: God is the source of all truth. Denying his existence in the first place will lead to wrong conclusions.
1.7.5.3. Pro: No contemporary [moral](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/) [theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/) requires the existence of God.
1.7.5.4. Con: Moral feelings can exist \(I feel that X is wrong\), but not moral obligation \(you must stop doing X because it is wrong\).
1.7.5.5. Pro: Moral obligation does not require a divine judge, as one can be morally obligated and judged via communal agreement.
1.7.5.5.1. Con: If social norms determine what is evil and good, then it would be evil to be counter-cultural, even in a society where the collective moral norms were analogous to that of Nazi Germany. Likewise, it would be morally good to abide by the norms of the Third Reich.
1.7.5.5.1.1. Con: There is an underespecification that renders words such as 'culture', 'cultural' and 'conter-cultural', obscure. One could very well argue that both the affirmation and the denial of a social norm may arise in the same cultural context and, therefore, sustain that social norms are contingent.
1.7.5.5.1.2. Pro: The concept of good/evil or just/unjust should be able to withstand majority rule and even provide a basis for going against it. Was slavery right when most people thought it was? What higher power could we have appealed to then to overthrow slavery if "right" was determined by the majority?
1.7.5.5.2. Con: Whatever we take moral constructs to be, they need neither the assumption of a deity nor the fiction of a collective agreement. Further insistence on this particular thesis would need to clarify when such bargain was struck, who agreed to it, what happens to eventual diverging parties, etc. Not to mention the methodological problems of defining the collective. Both the collective and the agreement are just as provisory solutions to moral dilemas as the existence of the divine.
1.7.5.5.3. Con: You are talking about a different concept of morality: here the discussion is about an universal concept of evil or goodness, not about a subjective moral. If there is not an absolute measure of moral \(the mentioned God\) then those concepts have no real meaning as anything can be good or wrong according to somebodys perception. In this case a God is required, if not, in first place discusing a quality of "evil" or "good" would not make sense in this discussion.
1.7.5.5.3.1. Con: This is semantically the same as "God is wiser than us.  We will never understand why all the suffering in the world is for a greater good, but we must have faith that it is."

The problem of the "have faith" argument is that faith is ultimately a choice to believe what a human tells you.  So we're back to argument from authority.
1.7.5.6. Pro: [A certain Hasidic tale supports the view that God is not necessary for morality.](https://multiparadigmperspectiveatheist.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/hasidic-tale-why-did-god-create-atheists/)  It is an all too common assumption that God is the origin of morality, yet this pessimistically assumes that humans are innately amoral and self serving.  The linked story offers an old tale of a master explaining how this is false.
1.7.5.6.1. Con: Assuming that God is the origin of morality does not require the assumption that humans are innately amoral or self-serving. In this instance, theism is merely an explanatory hypothesis for the existence of moral duties and obligations, which has logical advantages over alternative hypotheses.
1.7.5.6.2. Con: Agreed, except for your use of the term "self serving" as inherently amoral. All moral dictates eventually come to an explanation of how it is good _for you_ to do them. A moral code which requires self-abnegation is immoral to require of others.
1.7.6. Con: Even if there cannot be moral goodness and badness without the existence of God, it might still be the case that the existence of God is incompatible with the existence of evil. This argument therefore does not oppose the thesis.
1.7.6.1. Pro: The statement "The existence of God is incompatible with the existence of evil" \(roughly: "If God exists, then evil does not exist"\) and the statement "If God does not exist, then evil does not exist" can both be true. If they were both true, then it would be logically impossible for evil to exist.
1.7.6.2. Pro: An argument against the existence of God might proceed like this:
1. Suffering exists in the world
2. If things can be morally good or bad, then suffering is bad
3. If God exists, then things can be morally good or bad
4. Therefore, if God exists than morally bad things exist
5. God would not create morally bad things.
6. Therefore, God does not exist.
1.7.6.3. Con: if the attribute of goodness is rooted in nature of God then God by definition cannot be evil
1.7.7. Con: Good and evil are relative; someone claims their god sanctions acts as good while another calls the same acts evil.
1.7.8. Con: An anthropocentric view of things should make this a little clearer. Regarding natural evil, tsunamis for example, tsunamis are acts which are necesarily viewed as evil by those exposed because they end their lives... Natural goodness could be concieved as the conditions which most easily allow humans to maintaim homeostasis.
1.7.9. Con: Evil is a description of acts and behaviors we find to be a threat to safety and well-being. We are programmed via evolution to hate and avoid such things. Evil therefore describes an objective relationship we have with threats to our safety or well-being, and does not require a metaphysical explanation.
1.7.9.1. Con: We can conceive of actions not involving humans that would be evil. 
For example a large predator toying with it's prey and wounding it, before then discarding it rather than eating it.
1.7.9.1.1. Con: It still mean a human judgment call is needed, making "evil" human dependent and thus non-objective.
1.7.9.1.1.1. Con: That only is true to the extent that we have a choice in determining what evil is. Consider color vision for example. While we cannot prove that everyone perceives the same color, we do not have a choice to believe that the sky is green.
1.7.9.2. Con: If evil is a product of evolution, then what is considered evil is not objective, but subjective. 'Subjective evil' is the conclusion of this line of reasoning, which is to ultimately negate the existance of evil altogether.
1.7.9.3. Con: If evil is a description then it's a metaphysical concept that only "exists" in our mind. God would then also "exist" as a metaphysical concept in our minds and can therefore exist alongside evil.
1.7.10. Con: Human morality is subjective. We have no other way to evaluate the morality of god other than to use our own moral judgement. Therefore “god” is an unessessary construct in our own moral framework.
1.7.11. Con: Buddhism \(a non-theistic religion\) morality contains a clear ethical code of conduct.
1.8. Pro: The concept of the God of Classical Theism is incoherent because within the attributes of God contradict each other and they also contradict our experience of the universe.
1.8.1. Con: This has to be clarified as an argument as it has no example which of the many attributes of God and which experience of the universe the author means. Otherwise this should be dismissed.
1.8.2. Pro: The classical God promises an eternal life after death, but could equally as well provide an eternal life with no death, or two-way communication between the living and unliving, which would better serve the goals of the classical God.
1.8.2.1. Con: We do not know that eternal life without death or two-way communication between the living and unliving would better serve the goals of the classical God, the lack of them may well serve the goals of the classical God better.
1.8.3. Pro: Our experience of the universe is that causes strictly precede effects. However, an omnipotent God is not restricted to acting in the present; if omnipotent, He must also be able to change the past or act non-locally. If God is also minimally sensitive to mortal requests, then some prayer could, through God, have a result that occurred before it.
1.8.3.1. Con: Our experience is that causes normally precede effects, but our experience doesn't indicate that a supernatural God couldn't break this norm.
1.8.4. Con: Our experience of the universe is hardly definitive. We still have an infinite amount to learn about the universe. An omipotent, omniscient God may not be so easily understood by mortal minds.
1.8.5. Pro: God punishes Adam and Eve and all of their posterity for eating a forbidden fruit, displaying incoherent moral values that humans can't relate with.
1.8.6. Pro: [Here is a link to the biblical contradictions which support this claim](http://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2013/08/19/an-incredible-interactive-chart-of-biblical-contradictions/)
1.8.7. Pro: God's omnibenevolence conflicts with his desire to send his children to hell if they don't follow strict rules that are not taught to them well.
1.8.8. Pro: God's racism contradicts his justice in that he will allow his chosen race to massacre other races but condemn other races from massacring his chosen race.
1.8.9. Pro: God's omnipotence conflicts with his omnibenevolence because when humans need him the most, he does nothing.
1.8.10. Pro: God condemns murder and abortion, yet supports war and designs humans in a way that they die in birth and miscarry often.
1.8.11. Pro: God's omnibenevolence forbids him from lying, yet he does lie and recommends lying in certain situations.
1.8.11.1. Pro: God told Abraham to lie to the Pharaoh of Egypt.
1.8.12. Pro: God is supposed to be unchanging, yet God clearly changed between the Old Testament and the New Testament.
1.9. Pro: The traditionally conceived God is not internally coherent, even without any external observations.
1.9.1. Pro: The traditional conception of God as an agent with infinite power requires that the world exist exactly as He chooses, but the traditional conception of God also requires that He ask the world to change to comply with his will.
1.9.1.1. Con: God is outside of this world and therefore not defined by the rules He sets for His creation. \(The same way I am outside of the AI program I write, and therefore not defined by the rules governing it. And while I have absolute power to dictate the neural network I am programming to act as I want, I am also free and all powerful to give that particular AI free will and wait for AI to master its free will\)
1.9.1.2. Con: The traditional concept does not necessitate god having to ask when he wants to implement a change
1.9.2. Pro: The traditional omniscient, omnipotent God knows all things, including what things will happen in the future. That knowledge includes His own future actions, which prevents Him from choosing other actions, creating a contradiction.
1.9.2.1. Con: The traditional conception of God is that all of God's decisions occur "simultaneously" or outside of time, with perfect knowledge of all that occurs temporally, such that there is never a need for God to choose other actions.
1.9.2.1.1. Con: Without a temporal framework, no decision can ever be made. A-temporality is a state of unchanging stasis.
1.9.3. Pro: Omnipotence and Omniscience are self contradictory and impossible. There are things that God cannot do under traditional theism, rendering omnipotence absurd. There are things God cannot know about himself, making omniscience impossible. Omni-benevolence is meaningless when applied to God, since God traditionally defines goodness. To say 'God is good', is to say nothing at all, unless you are holding God to an external standard, in which case God is not the standard of 'good'. Why call him God?
1.9.4. Con: An omnipotent and perfect God is unlikely to be understood by mortal minds.
1.9.5. Con: "God" can indeed be omniscient and omnipotent. By which I mean "He" knows all possible outcomes of all possible decisions. Being omnipotent does not mean "He" chooses to direct all decisions. Example "I CAN decide whether that bee on the flower in my yard lives or dies, but if I CHOOSE to take no notice of it, that doesn't mean I don't still have that ability"
1.10. Con: The argument begs the question that the existence of evil in a system is sufficient to preclude the possibility of ultimate goodness in that systems creator.
1.11. Con: There is a monotheistic God. The existence of evil is all part of his plan to find the beings that worship him in truth.
