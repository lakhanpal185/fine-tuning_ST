Discussion Title: Should the US adopt a single-payer health care system?

1. The US should adopt a single-payer health care system.
1.1. Pro: There are [examples](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2017/jul/mirror-mirror-international-comparisons-2017) of several other western countries utilising the single-payer system with great success.
1.1.1. Pro: Single Payer systems outperform US systems internationally in terms of outcomes, efficiency, cost and equality of access. [www.commonwealthfund.org](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2017/jul/mirror-mirror-international-comparisons-2017)
1.1.2. Con: [Canada](https://www.globalresearch.ca/medicare-the-privatization-of-healthcare-in-canada/26935) is starting to privatize the healthcare system, which suggests the system doesn't work.
1.1.2.1. Con: In Canada, there are private hospitals but patient bills are paid primarily by the federal government.
1.1.3. Con: The UK has [private health insurance](https://www.moneysupermarket.com/health-insurance/) companies, so citizens buy health insurance to pay for further coverage.
1.1.3.1. Con: Most people do not purchase private health insurance.  It's very much a minority of people \([about 10.6% in 2015](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/16/private-medical-insurance-sales-surge-health-nhs)\).  It also doesn't cover emergency treatment, pregnancy, or any of your usual healthcare needs.  Many people never claim on it, even if they do have it.
1.1.3.2. Con: Private insurance is available in the UK, but the premiums are way lower \(about one-tenth of the price of U.S. private insurance\) since most healthcare is funded publicly.
1.1.4. Con: Since there are many sociological, economic, legal, and medical differences between the US and the UK, it is unreasonable to assume that implementing a UK-esque system in the US would work at even the level it does in the UK.
1.1.5. Con: Many of the countries listed in the linked article do not have single payer systems. The Netherlands, for example, has a system where private companies are allowed to compete, not a government monopoly: [www.commonwealthfund.org](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2017/jul/mirror-mirror-2017-international-comparison-reflects-flaws-and?redirect_source=/publications/fund-reports/2017/jul/mirror-mirror-international-comparisons-2017)
1.1.6. Con: The Canadian single payer is likely a violation of the bill of rights because wait times - which for elective surgeries are on average [7 weeks](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cambie-surgeries-healthcare-canada-public-vs-private-system-bc-dr-brian-day-1.3977566) - are so high that it violates the right to access care.
1.1.7. Con: The UK has one of the [worst](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-uk-now-has-one-of-the-worst-healthcare-systems-in-the-developed-world-according-to-oecd-report-a6721401.html) healthcare systems in the world, according to a report produced by the [OECD.](http://www.oecd.org/health/health-at-a-glance-19991312.htm)
1.1.8. Pro: When looked at at a cost/value ratio, the UK system is extremely effective.
1.1.8.1. Pro: [In the UK](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/Statistical-commentary-December-2017-11Jys.pdf), the NHS ER treats 85% of patients within 4 hours, with the target for treatment set at 95% of patients in 4 hours.
1.1.8.2. Pro: The UK system costs less than [half as much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) as the US system.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: This would suggest that steps need to be taken to reduce the cost of healthcare in the US. It’s not necessarily the single payer system that causes this:[The US does not regulate their pharmaceutical companies like Europe does.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/drug-prices)
1.2. Con: Any third party payer will reduce the number of available choices.
1.2.1. Pro: This attitudes of the electorate would determine what health care is available.
1.2.1.1. Pro: With only a single gatekeeper for health care, government policy can affect your treatment, such as prohibiting abortions, sex change treatments, procedures the government does not deem necessary, etc.
1.2.2. Pro: For example, Medicare and Medicaid do not cover acupuncture, homeopathy, and the use of herbs. Nor does it cover any experimental treatments.
1.2.2.1. Con: The former are not "experimetal treatments," they have no scientific basis and should be outside of medicine.
1.2.3. Pro: Third party payers by necessity include only what is most popular.
1.2.4. Con: It is unethical and immoral to deny basic healthcare to millions of Americans solely because it  may limit the variety of choices and low rates of others.
1.2.4.1. Con: Any ethical consideration must also take into account that nobody is entitled to the product of others' labor.
1.3. Pro: It would provide equal access to the same health care regardless of level of income.
1.3.1. Pro: There is less incentive for highly skilled health care professionals to work only for 'the best' institutions.
1.3.2. Con: What happens in other countries with one payer systems is the “normal” people have to use the under funded system, while the wealthy will pay out of pocket for better healthcare.
1.3.2.1. Con: Single-payer or tax-funded healthcare systems worldwide are not "all under-funded".
1.3.2.2. Pro: This also means the best doctors will gravitate toward the wealthy.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: The argument that "the best doctors will gravitate towards the wealthy" is itself an argument for narrowing the gap between least coverage and most coverage by providing a minimum national standard of healthcare that can afford to higher the so called "best" doctors.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: The "best doctors" are even more likely to gravitate towards the wealthy inside a system that ONLY affords the wealthy access to better doctors.
1.3.3. Pro: There is less paperwork to be completed for complicated insurance policies, which could be difficult for people who are unwell or poorly educated to complete.
1.3.3.1. Con: If there is a single-payer system it will inevitably involve the government and if there is a single, consistent principle of big government it is the generation of paperwork.   Thus, there is no reason to assume that there would be less paperwork -- it would just be different paperwork to a different entity.
1.3.3.2. Pro: The current Insurance market has numerous layers and middlemen. Reducing this down to single payer would reduce overall paperwork.
1.3.3.3. Pro: With a single payer, standardizing forms and processes provide opportunities to improve process efficiencies throughout the markets.
1.3.4. Pro: People would not have to make choices on health care plan options as a gamble on how sick you might get that year
1.3.5. Con: A single-payer healthcare system would lead to an increase in taxes and would therefore damage the economy.
1.3.5.1. Con: Tax would replace insurance payments.
1.3.5.2. Con: Reduction of ill people leads to a healthier and more productive population.
1.3.5.3. Con: Governments plead poverty when single payer is mentioned. Stop military intervention and not one person in the US will go without healthcare.
1.3.5.4. Con: Other countries have shown that a single payer system is viable without a detrimental effect on the overall economy.
1.3.5.5. Con: When earning 100k/year taxes and cost of health care are a higher percentage of income in USA then in Canada with single payer health care which you only pay taxes. According to [smartasset.com](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes) 100k income = 32% tax + you need to pay for insurance in USA. Ontario Canada [simpletax.ca](https://simpletax.ca/calculator) reports 28 % tax and you don't need to pay for health care or co pay. Health care is almost free in Canada and in USA it costs on average 440+ month + any co pay/fees you need to pay
1.3.5.6. Con: There would likely be demonstrable decrease to annual individual healthcare costs that are more significant than the tax increase, leading to a net gain.
1.3.6. Con: A common access to care may be none at all in many cases.
1.3.7. Con: Cost effective drugs and treatments may not available through the system.  Only extends to life extending drugs, not life saving drugs.
1.3.8. Pro: "[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_Liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_Happiness)" is meaningless for those who cannot afford their own health care.
1.3.9. Pro: Access to healthcare has a direct and significant effect on quality an longevity of life. Every American citizen should have this vitally important support.
1.4. Pro: Single payer would simplify the healthcare system for everyone.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.4.2. Pro: Information on patients is shared more easily between systems.
1.4.3. Con: People have diverse needs and values when it comes to healthcare, especially in the US, and pushing to simplify the system will create a one-size-fits-all approach which will put minority points of view at a disadvantage.
1.5. Pro: Saving human lives should not be an activity reliant on the incentive by profit.
1.5.1. Pro: Healthcare is a basic human right, according the UN definitions, and therefore to make it contingent on employment or income is to stand between citizens and internationally-agreed basic human rights. This makes the US not only an outlier but also borderline criminal.
1.5.2. Pro: Natural incentive for socialized medicine is to lower costs through improved health outcomes; natural incentive for private medicine is increasing margins through repeat business.
1.5.2.1. Pro: This helps explain why [most prevention dollars](https://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Universal-Health-Coverage-and-Health-Outcomes-OECD-G7-Health-Ministerial-2016.pdf)spent in the US are from individuals \(health products/memberships, etc.\) and corporations \(wellness programs\), not hospitals as there is no incentive to make people healthier - just to live longer.
1.5.3. Con: Money needs to exchange hands in some form for a system to be sustainable, and whether it's called profit, commission, grant, salary, is just semantics.
1.5.4. Pro: Uncontrolled for profit in medical sector results in an abuse and increase in cost. For exampe. "In September 2015, Shkreli received widespread criticism when Turing obtained the manufacturing license for the antiparasitic drug Daraprim and raised its price by a factor of 56 \(from US$13.5 to $750 per pill\), leading him to be referred to by the media as "the most hated man in America" and "'Pharma Bro'"." Martin Shkreli - Wikipedia [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli)
1.6. Con: -> See 1.3.5.
1.7. Pro: Single-payer health systems are more cost-effective.
1.7.1. Pro: The U.S. [spends more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) per-capita on healthcare than Canada or the UK.
1.7.2. Pro: Eliminating the incentive to raise prices for profit will reduce costs.
1.7.2.1. Pro: A study by the OECD found that the overhead cost of delivering care through Medicare was 3% while the overhead costs of delivering care through a for-profit HMO was 19%. The difference? Profit. Source: [healthoverprofit.org](http://healthoverprofit.org/2017/03/01/the-high-cost-of-private-profit-in-health-care/)
1.7.2.2. Con: The overhead cost of administrating medicare is not lower when one takes into account the implicit costs that are not registered as accounting costs- the fact that so many other government agencies \(Such as the IRS\) undertake administrative activities on behalf of medicare for which they are not billed.  Private firms must pay for these services.  When factored in, private firms have lower admin costs per patient than medicare does.
1.7.3. Con: Moving to a single-payer system would negatively affect international healthcare systems, as the US healthcare market essentially [subsidizes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterubel/2014/04/18/the-real-health-care-subsidy-problem/#46df36f32881) much of the rest of the world's access to new products and new procedures.
1.7.3.1. Con: These drugs/procedures etc are not exported for free - the companies still charge other countries for products and development costs, and the US healthcare system transitioning to single payer status would not change this.
1.7.3.2. Con: The focus of this discussion is the impact of a single payer system in the US. How this may or may not impact other countries is orthogonal to this discussion.
1.7.3.3. Con: New health related products and procedures do not necessarily lead to better outcomes nor are they inherently less expensive.
1.7.4. Pro: With one payer you get less bureaucratic overhead, making it cheaper and easier to use.
1.7.4.1. Con: When someone under a private system chooses and pays for their own healthcare, the only bureaucratic overhead is that individual person. It is unclear how adding a layer of bureaucratic overhead over the public market would reduce bureaucratic overhead.
1.7.5. Con: Cost effectiveness is far less important than individual freedom in choosing your own healthcare options and a focus on cost efficiency can trample rights. [Healthcare Rights Denied](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/25/health/alfie-evans-appeal-bn/index.html)
1.7.6. Con: Healthcare is fundamentally a risk venture. For profit insurers seek to take on the lowest risk patients. This leaves high risk patients the public system. Because they are high risk they will, on average, cost the system, placing the financial burden on the tax payer.
1.7.7. Con: Using monopolistic power to reduce costs is shortsighted and will lead to [deadweight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss).
1.7.7.1. Pro: In the context of healthcare, this means pushing down salaries for doctors, which reduces the incentive for people to work as doctors, which leads to a shortage.
1.7.7.2. Pro: It can also mean pushing down prices for drugs, which reduces the incentive to invest in research and development of new drugs, which means missed opportunities to cure other illnesses.
1.7.8. Pro: Single payer systems offer the advantage of bargaining power with drug providers and other suppliers.
1.7.8.1. Con: -> See 1.7.3.
1.7.8.2. Con: Congress has prohibited Medicare and Medicaid from using their buying power to negotiate lower prices.
1.7.8.3. Pro: The US tops the list of [per capita spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) on health care for member states of the OECD.
1.7.9. Pro: A single payer system would reduce the number of bankruptcies due to medical bills. This would mean providers would always be paid regardless of the patient's financial status.
1.7.9.1. Con: Providers of any government sponsored healthcare system are always paid regardless of the ability of the patient to pay.
1.8. Con: The US is the primary source of advancements in Medical research and technology for the world. This will be greatly diminished if the US removes the commercial incentives.
1.9. Con: A single-payer healthcare system would lead to a worse healthcare service.
1.9.1. Pro: Without prices generated by some sort of market mechanism, it is not possible to determine real demand and efficiently match supply with that demand.
1.9.1.1. Con: Given that there is currently a market mechanism, then following this argument to its logical conclusion the data must already exist and could be the starting point for setting up a single payer system.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: These processes fail to prevent waste in any of the existing single payer systems.  This is unsurprising, because without competition and the possibility of failure there are only weak incentives to be efficient.
1.9.1.2. Con: Service audit and quality improvement projects would ensure that there is no unmatched need or oversupply once the system has been set up.
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.9.3. Con: A public and private system competing with each other gives people choices, and pressures both systems to provide quality care at reasonable prices.
1.9.3.1. Pro: The Texas Medical Center has both public and private hospitals within walking distance of each other, and most of these hospitals are highly acclaimed.
1.9.3.2. Pro: In Harris County, Texas, since public hospitals offer free or reduced fee services for those who cannot pay, the private hospitals are more likely to work with patients who have difficulty paying.
1.9.3.3. Con: A purely private market also does this.
1.9.3.3.1. Con: A purely private system usually does not provide a safety net nor universal access to care regardless of ability to pay.
1.9.3.3.2. Con: If the health care market is dominated by a few large corporations, you lose a lot of the benefits of a private market, such as price competition and choice.
1.9.3.4. Con: As a general rule, public systems are designed to implement and respond to policies, as defined by elected officials and government employees.  Public systems are not market based, though elected representatives may respond to constituent pressures, which can lead to change.
1.9.4. Con: Currently health care in USA is worse then many other systems in place. Quality is questionable, for a large amount of the USA population quality is zero, given not care is available
1.9.5. Pro: The only way to keep costs down in a system absent of competition is to cut service.
1.9.5.1. Con: Single payer systems look for ways to reduce cost of service resulting in care that has better outcomes. Insurance based health care either looks for lower costs by denying care or increasing prices to maximize profit with the cost of peoples health
1.9.5.2. Con: There are many ways to keep costs down in a public healthcare system, such as providing preventative care and education to the public.
1.9.5.3. Con: The large buying power of a public health system reduces drug prices.
1.9.5.4. Con: The single healthcare records system, lack of sales teams, and no requirement for insurance company involvement at all, increases the overall efficiency of the system.
1.9.6. Con: The government is obligated to ensure a single-payer system includes checks that ensure a minimum required level of care is provided. To do less would incur the wrath of their constituents, in the next election.
