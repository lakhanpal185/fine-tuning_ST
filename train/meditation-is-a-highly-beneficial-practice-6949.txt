Discussion Title: Meditation is a highly beneficial practice

1. Meditation is a highly beneficial practice.
1.1. Pro: There is good reasoning and philosophy that support meditative practice.
1.1.1. Pro: It's a good thing to increase one's concentration.
1.1.2. Pro: There's prima facie strength to the idea that practicing and focusing a mental ability would nurture that ability. 

It seems probable that focusing and encouraging compassionate thoughts could make you more compassionate.
1.1.3. Con: That claim, if to be adhered to, strengthens the potency of philosophy and reasoning, not of meditation.
1.2. Con: Other behaviours or strategies may be more beneficial than meditation, produce the same effects with more efficiency, or less drawbacks.
1.2.1. Con: If you need to feed your dog, you can't meditate your dog some food. If you want to calm your mind or deepen spiritual practice, meditation is unbeat.
1.2.2. Pro: Meditation is very time consuming.
1.2.2.1. Con: An experienced mediator should easily reach a desired mental state in just a few seconds. A long practice is not longer necessary once the skills are mastered.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Meditation is a complex learned skill that involves deliberately controlling your consciousness. Any complex skill takes practice, and practice is time consuming.
1.2.3. Pro: Solving your practical, day to day problems is a good strategy for calming your mind.
1.2.4. Con: Meditation does not do the dishes, or anything else in the physical world. If you want to get better at washing dishes or any other physical tasks, practice will be necessary.
1.3. Con: The current mindfulness meditation movement is a fad, which lacks substance, and where meditation is over hyped.
1.3.1. Con: Mindfulness \(often investigated as MBSR or MBCT\) is structured practice that is scientifically proved by complex [meta-analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399903005737)
1.3.2. Con: Meditation has been widely practiced throughout history.
1.3.2.1. Con: The popularity of a practice doesn't necessarily prove its validity nor disprove it
1.3.3. Pro: Mindfulness meditation is now touted as a solution for a huge range of problems, and marketed extensively.
1.3.4. Pro: Meditation and mindfulness are being promoted by an extensive corporate mindfulness training network. It has been [suggested](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/455026/mindfulness-fad-corporate-america-buddhism-without-buddha) that they advertise claims that aren't properly supported by science, and they conceal the necessary Buddhist roots of the practice.
1.3.4.1. Con: It is not necessary to understand the Buddhist roots of meditation to benefit from it or learn it. It is useful historical perspective only.
1.3.5. Pro: It has been [noted](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11331034/Mindfulness-the-saddest-trend-of-2015.html) that simple mindfulness meditation, while can be effective against some problems doesn't address the deeper issues in individuals and cultures. Traditional meditation has been linked to an ethical system and life philosophy, to help with this, which is absent from modern mindfulness.
1.3.5.1. Con: The source is an opinion piece backed up with no scientific evidence \(that I can see\). How can you decide whether or not something is beneficial or not when you haven't defined anything to measure against. What are the "deeper issues"?
1.3.5.2. Pro: Meditation should not be used to replace professional medical advice, diagnosis and treatment if someone has psychological issues.
1.4. Pro: Science says meditation is beneficial
1.4.1. Pro: Many studies state meditation has benefits.  [www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/feeling-it/201309/20-scientific-reasons-start-meditating-today)
1.4.2. Con: The evidence for meditation's benefits aren't that strong. [Meditation is overrated \(Article:Scientific American\)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-meditation-overrated/)
1.4.3. Pro: Meditation has been proven to encourage and develop [concentration](http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2008914,00.html).
1.4.4. Pro: [Studies](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1809754) show that mindful meditation can help ease psychological stresses like anxiety, depression, and pain.
1.4.5. Pro: Even [brief mindfulness](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810010000681) practice has been proven to significantly improved visuo-spatial processing, working memory, and executive functioning.
1.4.6. Pro: Meditation has been [shown in studies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811909000044) to lead to positive alterations on the brain structure itself, which explain increases in positive and stable emotions.
1.4.7. Pro: A study by [Dr. Herbert Benson](http://time.com/4246928/meditation-history-buddhism/), a professor at the Harvard Medical School, found that people meditating used 17% less oxygen, lowered heart rates and produced increased brain waves that could help with sleep
1.4.8. Con: Sunk cost could account for a lot of the listed benefits. For example, yes, it might temporarily calm your stress, but it might be more beneficial and less time-consuming to solve your stress by solving your problems more directly.
1.4.8.1. Con: There exist some problems which exceeds individuals capabilities  to be solved.
1.5. Con: There are too many [different types](https://visualmeditation.co/7-types-of-meditation/) of meditation. It's hard to know which could be beneficial.
1.5.1. Con: This is a question of personal ignorance, not one that determines whether the practice itself is harmful or not.
1.5.1.1. Con: Not necessarily if there are certain kinds of meditation that are better suited for different things as there are different types of yoga for different applications
1.5.2. Pro: Meditation is about self discovery. It is experiential and results are not always predictable because they depend on the individual. If someone wants results, they may indeed need to try many different types of meditation to find one that works for them.
1.5.3. Con: Variety does not equate difficulty. This is akin to saying "There are too many different types of clothing.  It's hard to know which ones will fit, so let's just not wear clothes."  Instead we can try on different outfits to "see what fits."  It is relatively easy to explore different meditative traditions, "try them on," and experience first-hand whether one is beneficial or not.  Trial-and-error is not that hard...and benefits can be immediate and compelling.
1.6. Pro: There is a long tradition of meditation
1.6.1. Pro: Meditation has always been a core part of [Buddhist practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_meditation), and appears in ancient Buddhist texts dating back to 1st-4th centuries CE.

1.7. Pro: Meditation can be seen as a form of [mindfulness](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02703-004), which is proven to be [beneficial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3679190/) in many areas.
1.7.1. Con: A better way to exercise mindfulness in a certain area, is to direct your attention in that certain area, instead of cultivating 'general' mindfulness.
1.8. Pro: Many people say that meditation is beneficial to them
1.8.1. Con: However people can be deceived or fool themselves.
1.8.2. Con: The plural of anecdote isn't data.
1.8.3. Pro: Meditation enables you to be far more concentrated, discerning, and at peace in the world. Even if you do not consider yourself to be religious or spiritual, meditation enables you to receive insights about various problems in your life. It is something you must experience to know is true.
1.8.4. Pro: To stay calm and think about oneself and live in the moment provides a balance to the otherwise hectic daily life.
1.8.4.1. Con: Thinking about oneself isn't commonly what is meant when talking about meditation.
1.9. Pro: Meditation is an integral part of many people's religion.  Their religions add meaning and purpose to their life.
1.9.1. Pro: Meditation is a core tenet of [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_meditation).
1.9.2. Con: Many Buddhists, in traditionally Buddhist countries don't actually meditate.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Professors of Buddhism studies, Robert Buswell and Donald Lopez [state](https://tricycle.org/magazine/10-misconceptions-about-buddhism/) : "Meditation has traditionally been considered a monastic practice, and even then as a specialty only of certain monks. It is only since the 20th century that the practice of meditation has begun to be widely practiced by laypeople."
1.9.3. Con: You can participate in many parts of the religion, ritual, ethics etc., without doing meditation.
1.9.4. Con: -> See 1.4.8.
1.10. Pro: Meditation helps us to understand ourselves better, which is beneficial.
1.10.1. Pro: Meditation involves the deliberate study, exploration and understanding of our own consciousness. This allows us to understand how our emotions, beliefs and responses to life operate.
1.10.2. Pro: Meditation as an introspective insight can greatly assist if one is honest in his delving inward. it can help us shut out exterior noise, to listen to our own thoughts
1.11. Con: Meditation may only be beneficial in certain cases
1.11.1. Pro: Much of the science of meditation focuses on sick people, it may not be that useful for the healthy.
1.11.1.1. Con: It may be also [beneficial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002239991500080X) for facing daily issues and self-development for healthy individuals.
1.11.2. Con: Many people may just not like meditating.
1.11.2.1. Con: People that do not like meditation are often afraid of what they will find if they slow down and actually listen to all the rubbish running around in their head. Usually, these are the people that have most to gain.
1.11.2.2. Pro: That means \(proves\) that it isn't the panacea that many people make it to be.
1.12. Con: Meditation can be harmful
1.12.1. Pro: Meditation could be used as part of cult indoctrination.
1.12.1.1. Con: The vast majority of meditation sessions have no relation to cult activity. The majority of cult activity has no relation to meditation. If one is concerned about being indoctrinated into a cult, it would be better to just avoid cults, and learn meditation from a source that isn't a cult.
1.12.1.2. Con: So could literally any forced activity, or more specifically any other activity appearing "religious".
1.12.2. Pro: Meditation could reward one's being simple minded, limiting oneself mentally/intellectually.
1.12.2.1. Pro: If someone's response to practical life troubles is 'let's meditate', 'ward off thoughts' for example, this person limits their capacity to apply their mind to solve very real problems that won't be resolved by temporary silence.
1.12.2.1.1. Pro: Meditation can be used by some people to avoid taking action. Essentially they are using it as a form of procrastination.
1.12.2.1.2. Pro: Unfortunately, many mindfulness techniques are taught in a way that is very passive. This can result in time spent meditation without any real tangible results or direction being evident.
1.12.2.1.3. Con: Many schools of meditation teach you to be aware of your thoughts; these would promote the opposite of what's postulated. Again, this is a very diverse topic.
1.12.2.1.4. Con: Focusing on the solution rather than the problem is a key point to many who use meditation. This is more effective at problem solving than having intense emotional responses.
