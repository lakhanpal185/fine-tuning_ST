Discussion Title: The parties participating in elections for the European Parliament should hold primary elections

1. The parties participating in elections for the European Parliament should hold primary elections
1.1. Con: At the moment, it would add more complexity to a system which is in itself already complex.
1.2. Con: It's too difficult to organize them.
1.2.1. Pro: Moreover, who should organize them: the national or the European parties?
1.3. Pro: This would make MEPs more accountable to their voters.
1.3.1. Pro: Most MEPs are elected via party lists. These lists are filled by the parties without voters being able to influence the process. Primaries would give voters a more direct say and allow them to reward and sanction MEPs for their past performance.
1.4. Pro: People would be more involved in the discussion around elections.
1.4.1. Con: The elections for the European Parliament attract little public interest. Primaries might simply be an extension of this and equally get little popular attention.
1.5. Con: They would cost a lot and they're not worthwhile.
1.5.1. Con: They could be financed on a voluntary basis.
1.6. Pro: The quality of the candidates would increase.
1.6.1. Con: The other way around, the quality might also decrease as candidates who can attract public support get a chance, independent of their political qualifications. Right now, the selection process of parties ensures these qualifications.
1.7. Pro: The selection of the candidates would be more transparent.
1.7.1. Con: Primary elections can also be intransparent. The accusations against the Democratic primary in the United States in 2016 [as being rigged](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/democrat-primary-elections-need-reform) illustrate this.
