Discussion Title: Should conscientious objection to abortion be banned?

1. Conscientious objection to abortion should be banned
1.1. Pro: Refusing to perform an abortion is unethical.
1.1.1. Con: Abortion is a readily available procedure, so there's little merit to the argument that a single instance of refusing to perform one is unethical, even in the cases of medical necessity.
1.1.1.1. Pro: There are many clinics for women to attend [across America](http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-many-abortion-clinics-are-in-america-each-state-2017-2?r=US&IR=T), even if numbers have dropped.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: 27% of women in the US would need to travel [at least 30 miles](https://www.guttmacher.org/infographic/2017/how-far-would-us-women-need-travel-access-abortion) to access an abortion clinic.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: For women with a lack of resources, or who work demanding hours, this may not be feasible and would restrict their ability to access an abortion.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: [Not many cities](https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/maritimers-show-mixed-emotions-in-lost-access-to-abortion-services/article18902996/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&) have multiple abortion centers and abortion centers around the United States are [closing down](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/12/abortion-clinics-rapidly-closing-liberal-states). Rural areas usually have limited healthcare options. A referral to a doctor in the city may not be feasible for these people.
1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.3. Pro: [Only](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/rome-hospital-insists-gynaecologists-perform-abortions-1.2988084) 10% of doctors in the UK are conscientious objectors, 7% in France and none in Sweden. Therefore, unless one is living in Italy or the USA where there is a lack of doctors willing to carry out abortions, causing the doctor distress by forcing them to go against their moral principles is unethical, as it's not putting the women directly in harm's way.
1.1.1.4. Con: If those other doctors are far away or have long waiting lists they may not be feasible options for many women.
1.1.1.5. Con: A [survey](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1363/4304111/abstract) in the USA has found that 35 percent of reproductive-aged women live in an area which doesn't have any abortion providers partially due to conscientious objection.
1.1.1.6. Con: If conscientious objection is a legal option available to every single doctor, there is no way of ensuring that a sufficient number of doctors willing to perform abortions is available for women who seek one.
1.1.1.6.1. Pro: In Italy many women are [forced to go abroad](http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-italy-abortion/council-of-europe-raps-italy-over-difficulty-in-obtaining-abortions-idUKKCN0X820O) in order to get an abortion despite abortions being legal in Italy.
1.1.1.6.2. Pro: Due to conscientious objection, only [264](https://www.amnesty.ie/south-africa-women-girls-risk-unsafe-abortions-denied-legal-services/) out of 505 South African health facilities designated for the termination of pregnancies actually provide this service.
1.1.1.7. Con: Jobs in areas of medicine for a qualified doctor are readily available, so there's little merit to the arguments that a single instance of a field \(eg obstetrics and gynaecology\) in which someone was unable to work due to their conscientious objection is unethical, even in cases where doctors would love to carry out all the other aspects of obstetrics and gynaecology without abortion care.
1.1.1.8. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.1.9. Con: Access to abortions is limited, even in countries like [France](http://womensenews.org/2015/01/in-toulouse-french-family-planning-cant-keep-up/) which has one of the most progressive provisions on abortion and access to contraception in the European Union.
1.1.1.10. Pro: In the US, [abortion is legal in all states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States_by_state) and they cannot pass a law to ban it outright. This ensures that everyone who really needs an abortion in the States can get one.
1.1.1.10.1. Con: Women "can" get an abortion in any state of the United States of America, but states often [restrict access](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/why-its-become-so-hard-to-get-an-abortion) to it by passing laws that introduce mandatory waiting periods, mandated state counselling and limits on public and even private insurance funding.
1.1.1.11. Pro: Countries around the world have been [liberalizing their abortion laws](https://thinkprogress.org/the-surprising-countries-where-its-easier-to-get-an-abortion-than-the-u-s-a6079957c22b/).
1.1.1.11.1. Con: Despite the positive trend toward liberalized abortion laws globally, gaps in the [implementation](http://worldabortionlaws.com/about.html) of abortion laws and procedural barriers hindering access to abortion services impede scores of women from accessing such services.
1.1.2. Con: Abortion is murder and doctors have a duty to not to kill.
1.1.2.1. Con: Murder is defined as the unlawful killing of a person. Abortion is often lawful and therefore, not murder.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: The legal definition of murder and the moral or ethical definition may not coincide. Some nations have made euthanasia legal; some people still consider the act murder.  Some nations allow people of one religion to kill those of another religion without legal consequences, or mandate the killing of homosexuals.  Changing societal standards should not override an individual's belief that an act is fundamentally equivalent to murder.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: This turns into a circular argument, and is not a helpful argument in terms of using definitions against themselves. \(The main arguments against abortion say that it should not be lawful... The point is that it should be considered an unethical, unlawful killing, or murder.\)
1.1.2.1.3. Con: Legality and morality are two different things. While it may be lawful, it remains immoral, and thus should not be lawful in the first place.
1.1.2.1.4. Con: According to forensics, there are only [four types of death](http://www.exploreforensics.co.uk/the-four-manners-of-death.html): natural, homicide, suicide, and accidental. Abortion can not be called natural, suicide, or accidental, and thus only falls into the category of homicide. It may not be "murder" due to legal status, but it is homicide.
1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Abortion can be justified on grounds of self-defense.
1.1.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: At times, the fetus [threatens the life](http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/Phil160,Fall02/thomson.htm) of the mother. In such scenarios, it is perfectly legitimate for the mother to defend herself against such a threat and abort the fetus.
1.1.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: Apart from occasionally threatening the life of the mother, the fetus can also threaten future [prospects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831275/) like career options and wages. Mothers can choose to [protect themselves](http://www.csus.edu/indiv/g/gaskilld/socialissues14/abortion.htm) from such a harm.
1.1.2.1.4.1.2.1. Con: In order to claim self-defense, one must choose the mildest effective means available. Women can give their babies up for adoption, so abortion is not the mildest effective way to avoid the impact of motherhood, even after the woman has become pregnant. Therefore, abortion is not a legitimate means of self-defense against the financial losses that motherhood would entail.
1.1.2.1.4.1.3. Pro: During pregnancy, the mother has to endure physical pain. After birth, the [mental health](http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/postpartumpsychosis.aspx) of the mother can be affected. The mother therefore has a right to protect herself. \([Neff; p.g 25](http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&context=yjlf)\)
1.1.2.1.4.1.4. Con: Self-defense cannot be invoked against possible harms that one has consented to. Since the woman consented to sexual intercourse, she also implicitly consented to the consequences thereof, which include the possibility of pregnancy. Therefore, she cannot claim self-defense against the "assaulting" fetus.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.1. Con: Consent can be [revoked](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/16/AR2008041602921.html) at any time. In relation to the woman, if we are to assume she implies consent to the child through her sexual activity, this implied consent can at any point be revoked. Once consent is revoked the foetus does not have a right to the mothers body.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.1.1. Con: There are many instances in which consent cannot be revoked unilaterally, because others depend on the commitment. If the dependent party cannot or will not release the other from a commitment, we have to weigh the cost of fulfilling it against the cost that reneging on it would put on others. Since the fetus' life depends on staying in the womb, while carrying the child to term is usually just an inconvenience to the mother, it is justified to prohibit withdrawal of consent in this case.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.2. Pro: A boxer who enters the ring willingly also accepts that he will be hurt during the fight. He cannot claim self-defense if he shoots his opponent to stop the beating, because he consented to fight according to the rules.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.2.1. Con: There is a difference between engaging in risky activities and consenting to injuries or negative outcomes. There have been cases of Boxers suing due to injuries which occurred as part of a boxing match. One such example is [Prichard Colon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/boxing/family-of-prichard-colon-files-50-million-lawsuit-over-fight-that-left-boxer-in-coma/2017/05/04/f461f4e8-30e4-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.html)'s $50 million lawsuit after he ended up in a coma after a boxing match.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.2.2. Con: The 'boxer' example is disanalogous. A boxer knows that their opponent punching them in a ring is inevitable. Pregnancy due to sex on the other hand is a possibility. Individuals consent to inevitable outcomes of actions rather than possible outcomes.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.2.2.1. Con: People who sign up for military service in peacetime do consent to fight in a war that might break out, even though this is not inevitable.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Military service is disanalogous. Joining the military is only analogous to intercourse in cases when the woman intends to become a mother if she becomes pregnant, as the recruit is signing up for the military with the intent to fight should war be declared. A woman can consent to sex without intending to mother a child, while a recruit cannot join the military without the intention to defend the country.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.3. Con: Pregnancy can result from non-consensual intercourse, and under the "boxer" analogy alone, conscientious objection would strip impregnated rape victims of their rights.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.4. Con: Just because known risks to certain actions exist does not mean that individuals consent to them. A woman may know that contraception may fail. In the instance that it does fail, she is clearly not responsible for carrying the fetus to term because she withdrew consent to motherhood before intercourse and took measures to prevent a pregnancy.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.4.1. Con: The consent to sexual intercourse cannot be separated from the consent to consequences of that intercourse. Even though \(correctly\) using contraceptives shows the intent to avoid pregnancy, the woman still accepts pregnancy as a possible consequence of her actions.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: If we accepted that using contraception means that the sexual partners do not consent to parenthood, and would not hold them responsible for the fruit of their loins, then this would mean that men could unilaterally opt out of parenthood as well as women. However, this is not generally accepted.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.4.1.2. Con: This acceptance bears no ethical weight, otherwise we would have to accuse people of accepting every conceivable consequence of any given action, and that is absurd.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: The natural consequence and biological purpose of sex is pregnancy, we do in fact have to accept the biological and natural consequences of our actions.  Not all actions result consequences that directly related to its natural or biological purpose.
1.1.2.1.4.1.4.4.2. Pro: By using contraceptives, a woman is clearly refusing consent for her body to be involved in a child's development. Whether this contraceptive works or not, her intent has been made clear.
1.1.2.2. Con: Whether or not abortion should count as "taking a life" is highly contentious because of the problems surrounding determining person-hood.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Personhood is contentious, but [biology is not](http://www.biologyreference.com/La-Ma/Life-Cycle-Human.html). The human life cycle as a new, genetically distinct organism begins at conception, so 'taking a life' is an accurate description of abortion, even if 'taking the life of a person' is debatable.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: To doctors and scientists, the question of when life begins isn’t a matter of gathering more [evidence](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/science-cant-say-babys-life-begins/). Every iteration and advance in the lab make the question even more the purview of philosophers and theologians.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The source is not examining what scientists think about when biological life begins, but about the scientific lack of consensus about how biology can inform the question of when personhood or the soul begins.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Conception is the [beginning](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/child/alive_1.shtml) of biological life and a fertilized egg is a potential human being.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: At fertilization, all of the genetic characteristics, such as the color of the eyes, "are laid down determinatively." Conniff noted the prevalence of the above views in a study in which he wrote, "At that moment conception takes place and, scientists generally agree, a new life begins—silent, secret, unknown."[\(Rice, Charles pp. 29–31\)](http://Rice, Charles \(1969\). The Vanishing Right to Live. Garden City, NY: Doubleday & Company, Inc. pp. 29–31.)
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: At the point of fertilisation, the fertilised egg contains the full [genetic code](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/child/alive_1.shtml) of a new human being. This is therefore the beginning of their existence.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Patients that are brain dead also have fully developed genetic codes, yet families are allowed to request doctors to disconnect them from [life support](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1124803/), effectively ending their lives. It follows, therefore that mothers should be allowed to abort these fetuses in the same manner in which families are allowed to withdraw life support from brain dead patients.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: A brain-dead patient is not usually expected to recover within the treatment abilities of current medicine, whereas a foetus will continue to develop and will eventually have [active brain waves](https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/fetal-development/fetal-brain-nervous-system/).
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: This is the beginning of the foetus's [biological life](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/child/alive_1.shtml). From this point onwards, it will continuously develop inside and outside of the womb until it dies.
1.1.2.2.1.2.2. Con: Potential rights are [not the same](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/child/potential.shtml) as actual rights. For example, the heir to the throne is a potential ruler, but does not have the same rights as the King. Therefore, the fact that a fertilized embryo is a potential human being does not necessarily give it the right to life.
1.1.2.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Legislation in some places around the world recognises that foetuses have [actual rights](https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/medical-law/embryo-and-foetal-rights.php), not potential rights.
1.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: In [the struggle to try](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/child/alive_1.shtml) to determine the beginning of human life \(should it be the moment of conception, the moment of implantation, tissue separation, etc\), the moment of conception is one of the few points that is definite.
1.1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: By this logic, the moment of birth could could easily be defined as the beginning of life, since it is an equally definite point.
1.1.2.2.1.3.2. Con: By this logic, the moment that sensation begins \([24 weeks](https://thebrainbank.scienceblog.com/2012/12/04/what-can-science-add-to-the-abortion-debate/)\) can easily be defined as the beginning of life, since it is definite.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: A fetus has unique human DNA since an individual's DNA is formed by the combination of the mother's egg and the father's sperm. The fetus is also [alive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life), since it is made of cells that consume energy and reproduce and responds to stimulus. We should err on being generous with "personhood" and not parsimonious.
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: Allowing the government to decide personhood could be a slippery slope to the the government designating certain groups of people as undeserving of all the rights enshrined in the constitution.
1.1.2.2.3.1. Con: The government already designates certain groups as undeserving of the full set of rights guaranteed under the constitution, such as children or criminals.
1.1.2.2.4. Pro: It is not [science's](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/science-cant-say-babys-life-begins/) place to say when a fetus should or should not be considered a person because this is a decision heavily influenced by the religious morals and philosophical stance held by an individual or a collective.
1.1.2.2.5. Con: A lack of person-hood cannot justify killing an agent. Comatose patients, the mentally ill and people who are asleep are not persons in this sense either. Killing them is not allowed and so abortion should not be treated differently.
1.1.2.2.5.1. Con: The asleep have the ability to live without assistance.
1.1.2.2.5.2. Con: The comatose can be [removed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC557062/) from life support.
1.1.2.2.6. Pro: In the Supreme Court ruling [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade), the Supreme Court ruled that a fetus does not count as a person and therefore is not entitled to the rights enshrined in the constitution \(especially the protections enshrined in the [14th Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv)\).
1.1.2.2.6.1. Con: In the ruling, the Court determined that the baby in the womb [is not a person](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/01/21/roe-vs-wade-continues-to-haunt-americas-moral-and-constitutional-order.html), because if the fetus was considered a person, allowing abortion would mean allowing murder. Thus, the Supreme Court took it upon itself to define "personhood," a gross overstepping of its judicial duty. There's no real way to determine what constitutes a person, and so neither the Courts nor government should take it upon themselves to make such a determination.
1.1.2.2.6.1.1. Pro: The argument that a fetus "is not a person" or does not have a certain level of "humanness" is entirely [unscientific](http://www.frc.org/arguments) because both are decided by an individual's own personal moral philosophy.
1.1.2.2.6.1.1.1. Con: It is unclear why unscientific claims are illegitimate claims.
1.1.2.2.6.1.2. Pro: There is [no basis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20443281) in constitutional law for determining personhood.
1.1.2.2.6.1.2.1. Con: Laws cannot apply equally and fairly if there is not an objective definition of personhood. In the absence of clear guidance from existing laws it is the duty of the supreme court to clarify this ambiguity.
1.1.2.2.6.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.3.
1.1.2.2.6.2. Con: This may be a case of the "is/aught" paradigm. It is clear that the law "is" not considering a fetus a person, but it is not clear whether the law "aught" to consider a fetus a person.
1.1.2.3. Pro: It's wrong to kill a child simply for being unwanted.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: There are alternatives, like adoption, if the mother does not want to raise the child.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Adoption as an alternative still forces women to go through pregnancy-related pain, weakness and hormonal changes for nine months. A woman should have the right to protect her body from such harm.
1.1.2.3.1.2. Con: Given massive [problems](http://mashable.com/2016/06/04/foster-care-problems/#QTFTX37Goqq5) with the foster care system and the negative impacts it can have on children, a mother who wants the best for her child might still decide to abort it.
1.1.2.3.1.3. Con: Pregnancy and giving birth is dangerous. The United States has the [highest maternal mortality rates](https://www.propublica.org/article/die-in-childbirth-maternal-death-rate-health-care-system) in the developed world.
1.1.2.3.1.3.1. Con: There is [no direct link](http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/international/MCCLMaternalMort2012.pdf) between legalizing abortion and a decrease in maternal mortality rates, therefore the argument that allowing abortion is the ultimate answer to helping women is flawed and resources would be better spent elsewhere.
1.1.2.3.1.3.1.1. Con: As access to abortion increases, maternal mortality rates decline. Banning abortion, on the converse leads to an [increase in maternal mortality rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC557062/) as desperate women seek illegal means of abortion that are often unsafe.
1.1.2.3.1.3.2. Con: [Legalizing abortion](http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/international/MCCLMaternalMort2012.pdf) does not alleviate maternal mortality statistics because many other factors are more important in determining maternal health than access to or legality of abortion.
1.1.2.3.1.4. Con: Giving birth in a hospital can be very expensive. A [study](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2014/01/111071/how-much-does-it-cost-have-baby-hospital) found that, in a hospital, a natural birth can range from $3,000 to $37,000 and a C-section can range from $8,000 to $71,000.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: Abortions are often related to more complex feelings about having a child and what that would mean for a person, including concerns about being able to afford to raise a child. It is not always just a matter of whether a child is wanted.
1.1.2.4. Pro: It is [impossible](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/child/alive_1.shtml) to agree on the precise moment when an embryo or fetus should be considered alive, so society should err on the side of caution and use the earliest possible date, which is the date of conception. Therefore, abortion at any point should be considered wrong.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.3.
1.1.2.4.2. Con: The difficulties in determining when a fetus should be considered alive means that the lines drawn are relatively arbitrary. Given this, the woman, who everyone agrees is a living being with rights, should be given the choice about keeping a fetus.
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.6.1.1.
1.1.2.4.4. Pro: With the advancement of modern medicine, the point when a fetus can survive outside the womb arrives increasingly early. Therefore, abortion becomes less and less justifiable.
1.1.2.4.4.1. Con: Fetal viability exists as a function of biomedical and [technological capacities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11753511) that vary from country to country, from [developed](http://study.com/academy/lesson/healthcare-in-developing-vs-developed-countries.html) to [developing nations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3733305). Therefore, a fetus may be viable at some stage in a country but may not be viable at the same stage in another country. Killing one while allowing the other to live cannot be moral. Viability thus cannot be a metric when it comes to deciding the morality of abortion.
1.1.2.4.4.1.1. Con: If viability varies, the fair and moral answer is to not allow abortion at any point in the pregnancy.
1.1.2.4.5. Pro: The [Catholic Church](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/child/alive_1.shtml) believes that embryos should be treated as human from the moment of conception.
1.1.2.4.5.1. Con: [61% of Catholics](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/03/about-seven-in-ten-americans-oppose-overturning-roe-v-wade/) do not believe [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade) should be overturned.
1.1.2.4.5.1.1. Con: This does not mean that Catholic people do not believe life begins at conception, only that they increasingly also believe that women should still have a right to access abortions.
1.1.2.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.2.
1.1.2.5. Con: Even if it is assumed [that a fetus has a right to life, abortion is ethical.](http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/Phil160,Fall02/thomson.htm) There are limits to the right of life. For instance, it does not include the right to another person's body as a means of survival. Hence, the fetus does not have the right to use a non-consenting woman's body either.
1.1.2.5.1. Con: The right to life is the most protected right and supersedes all other rights as evidenced by the incredible judicial safeguards imposed only when capital punishment is sought.  The right to control one's body, however, is constantly regulated \(cannot use illicit drugs\) and ends when it interferes with the rights of others \(a person cannot use his or her own body to punch another person\).  Thus, the right to control of one's body must give way to another's right to life.
1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: If we saw a foetus's right to life as equal to the right to life of a human who has been born, we would treat miscarriages as criminal cases of manslaughter. So no we do not hold the right to life as superseding the right to bodily autonomy.
1.1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: It is absurd to assign blame to a woman who has had a miscarriage if she didn't do anything to cause that miscarriage. In many instances the woman wants a child who dies in the womb. Even if the fetus has a right to life, most societies wouldn't imprison a woman for miscarrying.
1.1.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: The [United States](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/indiana-has-now-charged-two-asian-american-women-feticide-n332761) has imprisoned at least one woman for this without evidence to suggest that she caused the miscarriage.
1.1.2.5.2. Con: This argument is based on a specific conception of morality. Utilitarians reject the claim that the right to bodily autonomy overrides the right to life of the fetus in this instance. \([Tyler, John p.g. 15](http://digitalcommons.cedarville.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=cedarethics)\)
1.1.2.5.2.1. Con: Not all [utilitarians](https://www.utilitarian.org/abortion.html) reject the claim that bodily autonomy overrides the right to life of a fetus.
1.1.2.5.3. Con: Since the woman consented to sex, she implicitly consented to the known possible consequences as well. Therefore, she consented to having a fetus dependent on her for the duration of the pregnancy.
1.1.2.5.3.1. Con: This is not true in instances of rape.
1.1.2.5.3.2. Con: This is not true in instances of faulty contraception.
1.1.2.5.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.4.1.4.4.2.
1.1.2.5.3.2.2. Con: Taking steps to mitigate the risk of an unwanted outcome does not remove the causality with regards to the consequences. It may reduce moral responsibility, but it does not free anyone from all liability. Her choices still caused the pregnancy even with contraception, and she knew in advance that she could still become pregnant. Therefore, contraception failure is a known risk that the woman willingly took.
1.1.2.5.3.2.2.1. Con: This is assuming the person taking the contraceptives was aware of the failure rate.
1.1.2.5.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: There is no reason to think that women who know about abortion would know about contraception. They are separate entities, in the same way that while both are methods of contraception a woman who is aware of the existence of the pill may not know about the implant.
1.1.2.5.3.3. Con: Someone can only consent to an action not a consequence. Sex is an action and any man or woman can consent to this action. The woman becoming pregnant is a consequence of said action.
1.1.2.5.3.3.1. Con: Actions have consequences. If you aren't consenting to consequences. You are not consenting to the act.
1.1.2.5.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.4.1.4.4.
1.1.2.5.4. Pro: The right to bodily autonomy is recognized by states and medical practitioners alike. This is evident in the cases of ['Do not resuscitate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate)' orders, where doctors are compelled to withdraw support if a patient is dying. Even the loss of life of an individual does not warrant violation of their consent and bodily integrity.
1.1.2.5.4.1. Con: There is a huge difference between choosing in advance to end one's own life in a particular situation, as in the case of 'do not resuscitate' orders, and ending another one's life when they pose an inconvenience. We cannot equate these two instances of 'loss of life'.
1.1.2.5.5. Pro: States can not force citizens to give away their organs to people in need of them. It may be a kindness to do so, but it is nevertheless not mandatory. Having the right to life does not put a [duty on other](http://www.rolereboot.org/culture-and-politics/details/2013-07-the-government-cant-force-anyone-to-donate-an-organ) agents to sustain said life.
1.1.2.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.4.1.
1.1.2.6. Pro: By the time most abortions are performed, a fetal [heartbeat](https://www.babycenter.com/404_when-can-i-hear-my-babys-heartbeat_10349811.bc) and [brain waves](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1375108/?page=1) can be detected.
1.1.2.6.1. Con: A heartbeat and brainwaves are not proper indicators of personhood.
1.1.2.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.5.
1.1.2.6.2. Pro: The presence of [brain waves](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1375108/?page=1) should be a marker for determining the beginning of life, because the lack of brain waves is used to determine "brain death," an accepted point for the end of life.
1.1.2.6.2.1. Con: The presence of brain waves does not mean that the fetuses' brain waves are the same as those of a fully formed human brain. For instance, a fetus cannot form memories.
1.1.2.6.2.1.1. Con: Both the body of the brain dead person and the baby can not sustain themselves on their own and can be allowed to die. This distinction may not be useful.
1.1.2.6.2.2. Con: The reason why [brain dead](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/06/health/brain-dead-basics/index.html) is used as a point of death is that the brain regulates body functions, so without it, the rest of the body cannot work and eventually shuts down. It is a symbiotic relationship and does not exist in a foetus or embryo, which has not developed enough of its body to survive outside of the womb.
1.1.2.6.3. Con: [It is not clear](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1375108/?page=1) if adult and fetal brain waves are the same. With an adult or child, brain waves mean consciousness and thinking, but there's no way of knowing what the detection of brain waves means for a fetus.
1.1.2.7. Pro: Even if the fetus is not yet viable outside the mother's body, an abortion ends an imminent life, which should also be considered murder.
1.1.2.7.1. Pro: Ending a potential life removes all future possibilities for that person to exist and be able to make choices and decisions. This is equally as bad as ending the life of a newborn who has all these opportunities ahead of them.
1.1.2.7.2. Con: If one is not allowed to end potential future lives, it is unclear where the line ends. This could mean it is unethical to use any form of contraception.
1.1.2.7.2.1. Pro: The extreme extension of this argument is that people should always be trying to allow potential lives to come into existence, which would mean they should always be seeking to procreate.
1.1.2.7.2.1.1. Con: This is evidently different from taking a positive action to end a potential life, such as obtaining an abortion. Failing to constantly procreate is an omission rather than a direct act which ends a potential life.
1.1.2.7.2.2. Pro: The Catholic Church is the most prominent proponent of this view, with some popes openly opposing the [use of condoms](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/17/pope-africa-condoms-aids).
1.1.2.7.2.3. Con: The difference between sperm and a fertilized human egg is that sperm will not spontaneously develop into a fully developed human. Barring abortion or miscarriage, a fertilized human egg will only become a fully developed human. Prior to fertilization, there is no potential life in that context.
1.1.2.7.3. Pro: The possibility of an entire future life could be seen as outweighing the small period of time for which a woman has to carry that potential life.
1.1.2.7.4. Pro: By the time an abortion is usually obtained, the fetus has a high chance of surviving to the stage of viability, and so the point at which one would get an abortion is also the point when there's a high chance of the potential life becoming a full life.
1.1.2.7.4.1. Con: In the US, only [1.2](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/5113/9611/5527/Abortion_After_first_trimester.pdf) percent of abortions in 2013 occurred at or after 21 weeks. At [22 weeks](http://www.newsweek.com/babies-born-22-weeks-can-survive-medical-care-new-study-finds-329518), a foetus has a 22 percent chance of survival and a 23 week old foetus has a 72 percent chance.
1.1.2.7.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.2.2.
1.1.2.8. Con: Doctors have as much of a duty to the woman as to her unborn fetus.
1.1.2.8.1. Pro: Making abortion illegal or difficult to obtain does not decrease abortions, it [decreases the number of safe abortions](http://prospect.org/article/what-happens-when-abortion-outlawed). History shows that when access to abortion is blocked, women will turn to dangerous, self-induced methods to terminate unwanted pregnancies.
1.1.2.8.1.1. Con: Abortion is murder, and murder shouldn't be necessary in the pursuance of women's rights or gender equality.
1.1.2.8.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.
1.1.2.8.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.
1.1.2.8.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.6.
1.1.2.8.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.7.
1.1.2.8.1.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.4.1.
1.1.2.8.1.2. Con: The debate is about banning conscientious objection for doctors, not making abortions illegal or difficult to obtain for women.
1.1.2.8.1.3. Pro: Before the ruling in Roe v. Wade legalized abortion, [5,000 women](http://prospect.org/article/what-happens-when-abortion-outlawed) in the U.S. died each year from unsafe abortions.
1.1.2.8.1.4. Pro: In South Africa the [high cost](https://iwhc.org/2016/07/high-cost-legal-abortion-south-africa/) of abortion due to travel costs causes women to go to illegal and dangerous providers of abortion.
1.1.2.8.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.2.
1.1.2.8.1.4.2. Pro: A [study](http://jfprhc.bmj.com/content/early/2014/12/15/jfprhc-2014-100999) in South Africa found that 45% of women seeking abortions did not receive them on the day of inquiry due to lack of funds or inability to travel.
1.1.2.8.1.5. Pro: In Romania, [more than 9,000 women died](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/15/abortion-romanian-history) between 1965 and 1989 due to complications with illegal abortions. This was under Ceaușescu's rule and at a time when access to abortions was extremely limited.
1.1.2.8.1.6. Con: In the U.S., [legal restrictions](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/american-abortion-rate-decline/395960/) aimed at limiting access to abortions have led to a decline in abortion rates.
1.1.2.8.1.6.1. Con: The demand for abortion does not decrease due to restrictions. A drop in abortion rates could be due to women traveling abroad for abortions or getting them illegally.
1.1.2.8.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.1.
1.1.2.8.1.6.1.2. Pro: Over [3,000](https://www.ifpa.ie/Hot-Topics/Abortion/Statistics) women reported an Irish address when seeking an abortion in England in 2016.
1.1.2.8.1.6.1.2.1. Con: That number does not come close to enough to explaining the disparity between Ireland's abortion rate and the [UK's abortion rate](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/570040/Updated_Abortion_Statistics_2015.pd), even when including documented [black market abortions in Ireland](https://www.ionainstitute.ie/ireland-has-a-very-low-abortion-rate-by-european-standards/).So either all \(or almost all\) the women who make up the disparity got one on the black market, and it wasn't documented \(there is absolutely no evidence of that\), or Ireland's abortion ban is reasonably effective.
1.1.2.8.1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Since abortion is [illegal](https://www.ifpa.ie/Pregnancy-Counselling/Abortion-Irish-Law) in Ireland, it is impossible to know accurate abortion figures in Ireland. Thus, it is futile to compare figures from Ireland with those of a country where abortion is legal and  the majority of abortions are documented.
1.1.2.8.1.7. Pro: A [study](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/world/12abortion.html) found that abortion rates in countries where abortion is legal and where it is illegal are similar, suggesting that making abortion illegal does not decrease abortion rates.
1.1.2.8.2. Con: The [Royal College of Psychiatrists](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/199/3/180) found that for women who had abortions, the risk of mental health problems increased 81%.
1.1.2.8.2.1. Con: A [study](https://www.thecut.com/2016/12/denying-women-abortions-is-harmful-to-their-mental-health.html) from the University of California compared the mental health of women who received an abortion and those denied an abortion. The case found that both groups of women had a similar level of depression, however the women who had been denied an abortion had a significantly higher level of anxiety, lower self esteem and lower life satisfaction. The conclusion was that the depression felt by both groups may have stemmed from having an unwanted pregnancy.
1.1.2.8.2.2. Con: Being denied an abortion when deciding to seek one can cause emotional distress and [mental health issues](http://time.com/4599806/abortion-doesnt-negatively-affect-womens-mental-health-study/).
1.1.2.8.2.2.1. Con: Violating one's moral principles \(whatever they may be\) can cause distress and self doubt, therefore forcing one to do so is unethical.
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: Some [doctors](https://www.liveaction.org/news/abortion-providers-and-the-emotional-impact-of-abortion/) report experiencing distress and trauma after performing an abortion.
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Not all doctors report experiencing distress, those that do maybe aren't suited to that field of medicine and should leave rather than potentially impacting access to healthcare for patients.
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.2. Con: It is possible to think providing abortion is ethical while also recognising that people who work in the field may need psychological support to deal with stigma and potential moral distress.
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Doctors who have had an abortion themselves may be reminded of a painful time in their lives.
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.3.1. Con: In this instance, healthcare professionals should seek out counseling and therapy. If the trauma is too great, a change of profession may be the only remaining option.
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: One [woman](https://liveaction.org/news/exclusive-former-abortion-clinic-worker-speaks-out-for-life/) working in an abortion clinic stated  "I saw my lost child in every jar of aborted baby parts."
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.4. Pro: Doctors who believe that abortion is murder experience the guilt and grief that comes with taking a human life.
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: [Dr. McArthur Hill](http://clinicquotes.com/former-abortionist-mcarthur-hill/), due to having performed abortions for a period of his career, identifies as a murderer. As a result he has experienced negative psychological symptoms such as nightmares and guilt.
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.5. Pro: Pro-life doctors who have been involved in abortions have reported [nightmares](https://www.liveaction.org/news/abortion-providers-and-the-emotional-impact-of-abortion/) and regret.
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.5.1. Con: There is no reason for people who are pro-life to be doctors who work in obstetrics and gynaecology \(ie there is no reason for them to be in a job position where they may need to provide an abortion\). If you are pro-life just don't work in the field.
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.2. Con: Causing distress is not per se unethical. These dangers need to be weighed against women's rights and medical necessities to determine whether this particular harm is unethical or a necessary evil to avoid more severe repercussions.
1.1.2.8.2.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.2.8.2.2.2. Con: This is very much the same with any medical procedure that you can be denied access to, be it for insurance reasons or other health restrictions. Rejection inherently causes [emotional distress.](https://ideas.ted.com/why-rejection-hurts-so-much-and-what-to-do-about-it/)
1.1.2.8.2.2.2.1. Con: This does not lead to the conclusion that all forms of rejection are permissible, but that all should be avoided where the potential harms outweigh the benefits.
1.1.2.8.3. Con: Conscientious objection does not prevent abortions as the case is referred to another doctor. Conscientious objection is also not applicable in emergency situations. Therefore the doctor is not risking the woman's life through refusing abortion.
1.1.2.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.2.8.3.2. Con: Abortion is a very safe procedure, but [the longer a woman waits](https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/10/abortion-america), the higher the chance of complications. Thus, time delays caused by conscientious objectors  threaten women's health.
1.1.2.8.3.2.1. Pro: Pro life doctors can claim conscientious objection to push back the time of abortion so late that it is no [longer possible for the patient to have an abortion performed](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301211517303573)
1.1.2.8.3.2.1.1. Con: Governments can regulate against such abuse by making it mandatory for conscientious objectors to immediately refer the patient to a doctor that is willing to conduct abortions. Governments can give these doctors a maximum time span in which they must give this information to the patient.
1.1.2.8.3.3. Con: Limited conscientious objection is contradictory and unworkable, and thus dangerous.
1.1.2.8.3.3.1. Pro: Such a provision is untenable because it is impossible to determine whether a situation is life-endangering and to what degree until the patient dies \([Fiala & Arthur, p. 14](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2213560X14000034/1-s2.0-S2213560X14000034-main.pdf?_tid=d05ad66c-9b12-11e7-9c4f-00000aab0f6b&acdnat=1505589256_08b26e90118024e146c596314b269fc1)\).
1.1.2.8.3.3.1.1. Pro: In Ireland, abortion is illegal except in cases where the woman's life is at risk, but [Salvita Halappanavar](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741)'s case shows that doctors are hesitant to act even if it is a possible emergency.
1.1.2.8.3.3.2. Pro: Many anti-choice healthcare workers are [unable to put aside their personal beliefs](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2213560X14000034/1-s2.0-S2213560X14000034-main.pdf?_tid=0b39b744-9a4b-11e7-92b8-00000aab0f02&acdnat=1505503456_63e6584cb07e35dfb807924ceb560241). They believe giving any information about abortion violates their conscience and so they refuse outright to provide any information, refer the patient to an anti-choice "counselling agency," treat the patient disrespectfully, provide misinformation, or delay the referral until it is too late for an abortion.
1.1.2.8.3.4. Pro: Many abortion laws such as the UK's [Abortion Act of 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/87/section/4) allow doctors to refuse to participate in terminations, but oblige them to provide necessary treatment in an emergency when the woman's life may be jeopardised.
1.1.2.8.3.5. Con: When medical professionals have the option of conscientious objection and use it, it can be difficult for patients to find physicians willing to do the procedure. These shortages and resulting delays can be extremely dangerous.
1.1.2.8.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.2.
1.1.2.8.3.5.2. Pro: In contexts where conscientious objection is the norm, doctors can be pressured into becoming conscientious objectors themselves.
1.1.2.8.3.5.2.1. Pro: As conscientious objection is ideologically motivated they have reasons to believe their bosses will see them negatively, with possible effects on their career.
1.1.2.8.3.5.2.2. Pro: They have reasons to fear mobbing from their peers.
1.1.2.8.3.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.5.
1.1.2.8.3.5.4. Pro: Since [70% of doctors](https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/claudia-torrisi/abortion-italy-conscientious-objection) in Italy are conscientious objectors, hospitals are forced to compensate with interns and consultants. Many of these people are unable to perform [therapeutic abortions](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/pro-aborts-worried-as-number-of-gynecologists-willing-to-do-abortions-drops), which are abortions carried out to avoid harm to the mother.
1.1.2.8.3.5.5. Con: Most abortions are planned, not emergency procedures; it should be possible for the government to provide funding and/or transportation to women \(and their husbands\) who live in areas where conscientious objection makes it too difficult to get an abortion. This would allow both sides to act on their consciences.  In emergency cases, the safety of the mother should take precedence over the doctor's objections.
1.1.2.8.3.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.3.
1.1.2.8.3.5.6. Pro: In the time it takes to have the appropriate consultations and find someone willing to perform the procedure, the pregnancy may have moved from first trimester to second trimester, and the patient would therefore require a major surgery with anesthesia.
1.1.2.8.3.5.7. Pro: This increases the likelihood that women who are already at risk due to their pregnancy will actually encounter complications. As most of these woman have complications which are time sensitive this could be a major problem.
1.1.2.8.3.5.7.1. Pro: A woman with a high risk pregnancy in Italy has reported having to travel to [23](http://www.thedailybeast.com/italy-needs-abortion-doctors) different hospitals before securing an abortion. Her eventual abortion was secured for her by the trade union CGIL as she was unable to find a doctor on her own.
1.1.2.8.3.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.1.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9. Con: Most Western countries that allow some degree of conscientious objection allow healthcare personnel to opt out of providing non-emergency care [only if](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2213560X14000034/1-s2.0-S2213560X14000034-main.pdf?_tid=0b39b744-9a4b-11e7-92b8-00000aab0f02&acdnat=1505503456_63e6584cb07e35dfb807924ceb560241) they promptly refer the patient to someone else who can help them. The countries still require medical personnel to provide emergency treatment. This is referred to as limited conscientious objection.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.1. Con: Some doctors will risk a woman's death rather than perform an abortion.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.1.1. Pro: In 2016, Valentina Milluzzo died in Sicily after suffering and being in critical condition for twelve hours, during which she repeatedly requested an abortion. The [doctor](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/22/italy-death-miscarriage-abortion-doctors-refuse-procedure) stated he could not intervene because he objected to abortion and the foetus still had a heartbeat. All the doctors in that hospital were conscientious objectors to abortion.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.1.1.1. Pro: Some [hospitals](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/22/italy-death-miscarriage-abortion-doctors-refuse-procedure) in Italy call in specialists if they require someone to perform an abortion. This can and has previously led to dangerous delays, endangering the lives of pregnant women.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.1.1.2. Con: There is no [proof](https://carolinefarrow.com/2016/10/23/here-we-go-again/) that an abortion would have saved Milluzzo's life at this point.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.1.1.2.1. Con: Milluzzo's choice should have been respected whether the doctor believed it was correct or not.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.1.1.2.2. Con: The trauma caused by a second birth could not have aided an already severely sick woman.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.1.1.3. Pro: In [Sicily](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a7025177/italy-woman-doctor-abortion-refusal-death/), where this case took place, 87.6% of doctors are conscientious objectors.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.1.1.4. Con: Sepsis is a complication you can die of, pregnant or not. Abortion is not a medical treatment for sepsis but its recognition and treatment with the appropriate antibiotics is. The claim that the patient died because of the failure to have an abortion is hypothetical as sepsis is a complication also when having an abortion under medical supervision.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.3.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.3. Con: Conscientious objection restricts access to abortion by making it more difficult for women to find a doctor willing to perform abortions.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.3.1. Pro: Limited conscientious objection hurts women from lower socio-economic classes. Even if a referral is provided, these women may not be able to access abortion because of transportation costs or the inability to go to far flung places.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.5.5.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.3.2. Pro: Doctors are most likely to follow pro-life stances in poor rural communities because of the [stronghold of religion in such places.](http://news.gallup.com/poll/7960/age-religiosity-rural-america.aspx) This hurts women who specifically live in these communities.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.3.2.
1.1.2.8.3.5.9.3.4. Con: A possible nuance could be: making sure that a reasonable amount of practitioners can do the abortion at any time, so that women don't find themselves in a position where they can't abort because every practitioner raise their conscientious objection right
1.1.2.8.3.5.10. Pro: In the U.S. there are only [four doctors](http://jezebel.com/5976977/there-are-only-four-docs-left-who-perform-late-term-abortions) left who will perform third trimester abortions due to anti-abortion attacks. Conscientious objection allows Doctors to refuse to perform abortions for reasons of safety as well as religion.
1.1.2.8.3.5.10.1. Pro: In the U.S., [80% of abortions](https://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2016/10/20/donald-trump-confuses-birth-with-abortion-and-no-there-are-no-ninth-month-abortions/) after the 21st week are due to birth defects. Abortions after 24 weeks are [generally](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/10/21/doctors-trump-wrong-late-abortions/92515324/) only for fetuses with such severe defects that they would not survive outside of the womb. This means that the abortions which are the hardest to receive are usually for people who have little choice in the matter and whose children never had a chance of survival.
1.1.2.8.3.5.10.1.1. Con: In the UK, Down's Syndrome is considered a birth defect and a legitimate reason for abortions after [24 weeks](https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/terminationpregnancyreport18may2010.pdf) \(pg. 23, 11\). Down's Syndrome does not prevent someone from living a long and happy life and so should not be a valid reason for an abortion.
1.1.2.8.3.6. Con: This is not the case everywhere: In the [UK](http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/21177.asp), a doctor does not have an obligation to refer a patient, but must only "give them accurate information to proceed". This could be interpreted quite loosely.
1.1.2.8.3.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.5.9.1.
1.1.2.8.3.8. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.3.2.
1.1.2.8.4. Con: Abortions are dangerous and detrimental to women.
1.1.2.8.4.1. Con: Abortion is safer than childbirth \([ACLU, p. 2](https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/TRAP_FAQ_FactSheet.pdf)\).
1.1.2.8.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.3.
1.1.2.8.4.2. Con: By 1987, the mortality due to abortions was already as low as [0.4 in 100,000 abortions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232137/).
1.1.2.8.4.2.1. Con: Abortion is murder, so the mortality rate of successful abortion is 100% if successful in causing the death of the unborn baby, even higher if the mother dies as well.
1.1.2.8.4.3. Con: Whether abortions are dangerous or not should not have any weight on the specific question of "conscientious objection". A surgery's risks should not overshadow the patient's rights or choices.
Such arguments better fit this [other discussion](https://www.kialo.com/should-women-have-the-right-to-choose-abortion-5637/5637.0=5637.1/=5637.1).
1.1.2.8.4.4. Pro: Surgical abortion can lead to [serious health complications](http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/international/MCCLMaternalMort2012.pdf), including hemorrhage, infection, cervical laceration, and uterine perforation.
1.1.2.8.4.4.1. Con: Women are aware of these risks once they go in for an abortion.
1.1.2.8.4.5. Pro: Abortion can have serious [long-term effects](http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/international/MCCLMaternalMort2012.pdf).
1.1.2.8.4.6. Pro: Abortion can seriously affect [mental health](http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/international/MCCLMaternalMort2012.pdf).
1.1.2.8.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.2.
1.1.2.8.4.6.2. Pro: Some women \(and men\) [regret their decision](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38775641) to have an abortion later in life.
1.1.2.8.4.6.2.1. Con: Humans often make decisions which they later regret, yet that is no reason to take freedom of choice away from them. It is their human right to make these decisions themselves and live with the consequences.
1.1.2.8.4.6.2.2. Con: Though this may be true for some people, data indicates that this is only the case for [5% of women](http://time.com/3956781/women-abortion-regret-reproductive-health/) who had an abortion.
1.1.2.8.4.6.3. Con: Women who get abortions are [not more likely](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/Risks.aspx) to suffer from mental health problems than other women.
1.1.2.8.4.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.2.1.
1.1.2.8.4.7. Con: The UK's National Health Service writes that abortion is ["generally very safe."](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/Risks.aspx)
1.1.2.8.4.8. Con: [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/considering-abortion/what-facts-about-abortion-do-i-need-know) says that abortion is "one of the safest medical procedures out there."
1.1.2.8.4.9. Con: Women can be informed about the potential dangers of an abortion by their doctor, and if they chose to proceed, it is their choice.
1.1.2.8.4.10. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.1.
1.1.2.8.5. Con: The obligations are not the same. Assuming that the abortion is not a medical necessity, the obligation to protect life -as in the "do no harm" principle -favors the fetus.
1.1.2.8.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.2.2.
1.1.2.8.5.2. Con: Having a child when not mentally or financially ready for it can endanger both the woman and her child.
1.1.2.8.5.2.1. Pro: Having a child without the financial resources necessary to care for them could mean that both the woman and her child have to live in unsuitable conditions which could be detrimental to their health, and mean that the child has a particularly difficult childhood.
1.1.2.8.5.2.2. Pro: Being forced to have a child when not mentally ready for one could lead to the mother feeling resentful towards the child and could put strain on the mother/child relationship. [Studies](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-a-grimes/abortion-denied-consequences-for-mother-and-child_b_6926988.html) show women denied abortion often struggle from feelings of anxiety and resentment.
1.1.2.8.5.2.3. Pro: More than [one-third](http://www.cctech.edu/documents/unplannedpregnancyandcommunitycolleges.pdf) of all unplanned pregnancies in the US are to unmarried women in their 20s, and single mothers have a [higher risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714708) of physical and mental health disorders.
1.1.3. Pro: A doctor refusing to perform a legal medical procedure, like an abortion, that the patient requests, is acting unethically. The American Medical Association's [Code of Medical Ethics](https://www.ama-assn.org/sites/default/files/media-browser/code-of-medical-ethics-chapter-1.pdf) states that the physician has an ethical responsibility to place the patient's welfare above their own personal self-interest or feelings.
1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.2.2.
1.1.3.2. Con: The next paragraph of the AMA's Code of Medical Ethics states that "A patient-physician relationship exists when a physician serves a patient’s medical needs. Generally, the relationship is entered into by mutual consent between physician and patient \(or surrogate\)."  Thus it is unethical to force a Doctor to enter a patient-physician relationship without consent.
1.1.3.3. Con: The [Code of Medical Ethics](https://www.ama-assn.org/sites/default/files/media-browser/code-of-medical-ethics-chapter-1.pdf) section 1.1.1 states that the physician responsibility regarding patient's welfare comes from the fundamentally moral imperative to care for patients. A physician treating a pregnant woman has an implicit responsibility to care for the unborn child as well as the woman herself.
1.1.3.4. Con: Professional ethics should not outweigh personal ethics in all circumstances. Conscientious objections in times of war are necessary for the protection of innocent lives in some situations. A doctor may choose to protect what they perceive as an innocent life too.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: It is an established practice to allow people to conscientiously object to military service.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Theories of [selective conscientious objection](https://www.library.georgetown.edu/woodstock/murray/1967l) to military service recognise that it is possible for soldiers to be opposed to a particular war, while not being opposed to war in general. This would be analogous to allowing people to become doctors, but objecting to a specific procedure.
1.1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: In 1971, the [US Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillette_v._United_States) ruled that the right to conscientious objection only applies to those who oppose war as a whole, not to those who oppose a particular war.
1.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: If the state cannot force pacifists to become soldiers, it cannot force religious doctors to perform abortions either.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: Under the policy as proposed, nobody would be forced to do anything: doctors would be punished for refusing to perform an abortion, but they are free to choose between the abortion and a punishment determined by the democratic process.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1.1. Con: The definition of coercion is that somebody compels another to act against their own will through the use of force or a threat thereof, when the perpetrator's demand is not justified. Under the proposed policy, the state would use the threat of financial harm in order to make the doctor perform abortions, which is clearly coercive.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: State authority is always ultimately backed up by the threat of violence, since the state holds the monopoly of violence. Hence, even financial penalties are ultimately based on the threat of violence.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The financial opportunity cost associated with avoiding gynecology, by specializing in a non-birth-related area of medicine, does not constitute a harm which is based on the threat of violence.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: The use of force is only justified when defending individual rights, such as self-defense against violent attacks on person or property, asserting control over one's own property, or enforcing contracts that all parties willingly entered into.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: For a choice to be free, it must be free of penalty for taking it. If society forces some to choose between violating conscience or taking punishment, then it is restricting choice, not allowing a free choice.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1.2. Con: Punishment by the law is a direct force of action to penalize, imprison, or otherwise [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement) the criminal to pay for a crime.
1.1.3.4.1.2.1.3. Pro: No one is required to become or remain a doctor, those who made the choice to become doctors would merely be required to do their job.
1.1.3.4.1.2.2. Con: By that same rationale, a doctor can adopt some obscure home-made religion X that prohibits contact with Jews, Blacks, homosexuals, and people with curly hair. Such a doctor would then have the legal right to refuse treating such patients because treating them would be a violation of his religious beliefs. Such doctors must be allowed to exist if we accept a religious doctor's argument "I cannot treat this patient because doing so would violate my religious beliefs."
1.1.3.4.1.2.3. Con: The state has not forced the religious individual to become a doctor in the first place, nor has it forced the doctor to withdraw from the profession either. The doctor can choose an alternative field.
1.1.3.4.1.3. Con: Most western countries today protect conscientious objection for military service, but objectors must still justify their stance, are often required to undergo a rigorous review process, and are frequently punished. By contrast, doctors usually face no obligation to justify their refusals, rarely face any disciplinary measures, and retain their positions \([Fiala & Arthur, p. 4](https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2213560X14000034/1-s2.0-S2213560X14000034-main.pdf?_tid=50105c5e-a5d8-11e7-aa09-00000aacb35f&acdnat=1506773593_23ef23ea64188d3c20b4d454d4ded7f2)\).
1.1.3.4.1.4. Con: The [power imbalance](https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2213560X14000034/1-s2.0-S2213560X14000034-main.pdf?_tid=50105c5e-a5d8-11e7-aa09-00000aacb35f&acdnat=1506773593_23ef23ea64188d3c20b4d454d4ded7f2) between healthcare professionals and patients is a reversal of that between foot soldiers and their commanders. The legitimate exercise of conscientious objections can only be by the powerless against the powers-that-be — not by the privileged against regular people who rely on them for essential services.
1.1.3.4.1.4.1. Pro: The inherent power imbalance in doctor-patient interactions exists largely because the patient comes to the physician for help, immediately placing the physician in a position of power.
1.1.3.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: The medical profession requires doctors to be in a position of power, because then only can they expect a patient to agree with diagnosis and pursue treatment as they have suggested.
1.1.3.4.1.4.2. Pro: The medical profession requires doctors to be in a position of power, because only then can they expect a patient to agree with diagnosis and pursue treatment as they have suggested.
1.1.3.4.1.4.3. Con: Conscientious objection with regards to military service does not mean refusing specific orders, it means objection to being drafted in the first place, because one is conscientiously objecting to the whole concept of war. Accepting conscientious objection in this case means that pacifists are not required to serve in the military. The power structure here is the state conscripting men, not officers issuing orders. This is comparable to the state conscripting doctors to perform abortions.
1.1.3.4.1.5. Con: The two situations are not comparable because doctors chose to enter the medical field of their own free will, where as those drafted into military service \(and who subsequently chose to be conscientious objectors\) have no choice in the matter and often face serious repercussions for their beliefs.
1.1.4. Pro: The fact that some doctors are conscientious objectors, forces other doctors to perform more abortions, in spite of other parts of the job they might enjoy more. It's unfair.
1.1.4.1. Con: The inconvenience other doctors face pales in comparison to making someone who joined a profession to help people commit what they believe is murder.
1.1.5. Pro: Conscientious objection endangers the lives and health of women.
1.1.5.1. Con: A higher risk of mental or physical health problems for one or more parties \(parent and child\) is simply a risk, whereas if the unborn are human, when aborted, they are surely dead and the mother is still at risk during the procedure \(physically\) and after it \(mentally\), especially if her views on unborn life change. So the lesser risk is to not allow elective abortions.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: It is misleading to classify the trauma a woman faces during a forced pregnancy as merely a risk of harm, it is traumatic enough to classify as a harm itself.
1.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.5.9.1.
1.1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.3.
1.1.5.5. Con: Many charity healthcare units are funded by the Catholic Church or other religious groups. Denying the right to conscientious objection would force these institutions to go against their own belief system. This could lead to them withdrawing from this kind of humanitarian aid, depriving women in the affected areas of all health care rather than just access to abortion.
1.1.5.5.1. Con: Charity clinics operated by religious organisations do not provide [reproductive healthcare](https://rewire.news/article/2013/03/25/dont-take-her-to-catholic-hospital/), including abortions in the vast majority of cases. Therefore, denying conscientious objection would not really matter.
1.1.5.5.1.1. Con: Most of them offer prenatal medical follow up, and that makes them have all of the specialties necessary for an abortion. If doctors were forced to perform an abortion, then the state would, actually, be forcing Church related humanitarian health care to perform abortions.
1.1.5.5.2. Con: Due to the [history](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/03/mass-graves-ireland-long-history-church-abuse-170321060241996.html) of [abuse](http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/magdalene-laundries-ireland) perpetuated by the Catholic Church in regards to women and children, it may be safer in the long run if religious organisations' involvement in healthcare, specifically reproductive healthcare, was ended.
1.1.5.5.2.1. Pro: In [Ireland](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/three-who-stopped-the-cancer-tests-25960150.html), the Catholic Church's involvement in the Mater Hospital was the reason lung cancer patients were denied a pill which could've prolonged their lives. This was because the trial required women who could still become pregnant to take the contraceptive pill while under treatment.
1.1.5.5.2.2. Pro: In response to past abuses perpetuated by the Catholic Church in Ireland, [public outcry](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/29/sisters-of-charity-nuns-give-up-role-in-dublin-maternity-hospital) has forced the nuns to give up their connections to St Vincent’s Healthcare Group \(SVHG\), the trust set up to manage the new maternity facilities in Dublin.
1.1.5.5.2.3. Con: The largest provider of non-governmental healthcare in the world is the Catholic church, an institution that helps millions \([Agnew, p. 47](http://www.geog.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/users/jagnew/391.pdf)\). Stopping their activities in healthcare would leave millions unattended for. It is an organization with its own values and it has the right to these values.
1.1.5.5.2.4. Con: It's easy to suggest that when there are options available for healthcare. In many parts of the world, the Catholic Church offers the only available healthcare. In these places, the alternative to them would be no access to healthcare at all, creating significant health risks.
1.1.5.5.2.4.1. Pro: The Catholic Church is the [primary or only provider](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4133169/) of health care in a number of regions across the United States and [one in six hospitals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/judystone/2016/05/07/health-care-denied-at-550-hospitals-because-of-catholic-doctrine/#33520ff25ad9) in the country are operated in accordance with Catholic doctrine.
1.1.5.5.2.4.2. Pro: Findings from a 2016 [report](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/6-findings-on-the-growth-of-catholic-hospitals-and-health-systems.html) have found 46 Catholic-restricted hospitals in the US that are the only community providers of short-term hospital care for people living in their geographic regions.
1.1.5.5.2.5. Pro: Due to its affiliation with [PeaceHealth](https://aclu-wa.org/blog/aclu-calls-san-juan-comply-washington-s-reproductive-privacy-act-0), a Catholic health system, Peace Island Medical Centre in St Juan consistently refuses to provide abortion services or even direct referrals to providers willing to provide abortion services. This is an issue as St Juan is an island and women have to [travel](http://www.sanjuanjournal.com/news/aclu-calls-on-hospital-district-to-comply-with-state-law/) off the island for these services.
1.1.5.5.2.5.1. Con: Removal of the Catholic Health system from service would remove all health care in this area resulting in every one having to travel off island for all health care not just those who wish to kill their child.
1.1.5.5.3. Pro: Orders of nuns were responsible for the setting up of many of Ireland’s hospitals in the 19th and 20th centuries. Their influence is still there as shown in 2001 when the Sisters of Mercy sold the Mater hospital to the State with the contingency that its Catholic ethos, first espoused by the order’s founder Catherine McAuley, [be retained.](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/catholic-church-s-influence-over-irish-hospital-medicine-persists-1.2626856)
1.1.5.6. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.5.9.
1.1.5.7. Con: Abortion is murder, so conscientious objection protects the lives of unborn women and men.
1.1.5.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.7.
1.1.5.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.6.
1.1.5.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.
1.1.5.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.5.7.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.5.
1.1.5.7.6. Con: Conscientious objection to providing an abortion to a suicidal person \([suicide is a leading cause of maternal mortality](http://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i6585)\) who has decided they need one and who subsequently kills themselves due to the refusal does not protect the right to life of that person or their unborn child.
1.1.5.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.5.2.
1.1.5.9. Con: Doctors who perform abortions half-heartedly because they consider it unethical are an even greater danger to women's health. It is safest for them to conscientiously object and refer patients to a doctor who treats them of their own free will.
1.1.5.9.1. Con: Performing medical procedures half-heartedly to the extent where it endangers the patient's health would be gross professional negligence and highly unprofessional. Such behaviour is penalized either by professional organisations or by the state via criminal law.
1.1.5.9.1.1. Con: Doctors who have strong religious convictions are [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2867468/) to be significantly less likely to respect a patient's autonomy. These doctors, if not given the option of conscientious objection, may make abortions more difficult for the patient due to this. They would be unlikely to cause harm, but they may make the treatment more stressful and difficult.
1.1.5.9.2. Pro: This would likely be true regardless of the intent of the physician because, according to [Sigmund Freud](https://www.simplypsychology.org/unconscious-mind.html), the unconscious rules one's behavior to a large degree.
1.1.5.10. Con: Conscientious objection does not lessen the availability of optimal care for pregnant women.
1.1.5.10.1. Pro: An international symposium of medical professionals [examining issues and research](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/forum-in-dublin-on-maternal-health-1.527381) regarding maternal health [concluded](https://www.dublindeclaration.com/), "We confirm that the prohibition of abortion does not affect, in any way, the availability of optimal care to pregnant women.”
1.1.5.10.1.1. Con: The definition of abortion used by this organization is different than other common definitions. "We uphold that there is a fundamental [difference](https://www.dublindeclaration.com/) between abortion, and necessary medical treatments that are carried out to save the life of the mother, even if such treatment results in the loss of life of her unborn child."
1.1.5.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.5.
1.1.5.12. Con: Most abortions are not sought for medical reasons.
1.1.5.12.1. Pro: In the US, abortion is nearly never chosen because of possible problems with the mother's health \([96%](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/pubs/psrh/full/3711005.pdf) of cases, page 114\), so if a doctor can refer the patient to someone else, who would perform an abortion, there is no danger to neither health nor life of a women. Even in those ~4% of cases it's highly possible that danger is not so imminent that it requires an immediate decision.
1.1.5.12.2. Pro: During the first 25 years of the operation of the Abortion Act 1967 in the U.K., only [0.013% of all abortions](http://www.cmfblog.org.uk/2012/04/27/abortion-to-save-the-life-of-the-mother-how-common-is-it/) were performed ‘to save the life of the mother.’
1.1.5.12.3. Pro: Medical professionals at an international maternal health symposium formulated a statement, signed by hundreds of doctors since, that: "as practitioners and researchers in obstetrics and gynaecology, we affirm that direct abortion – the purposeful destruction of the unborn child – is [not medically necessary](https://www.dublindeclaration.com/) to save the life of a woman."
1.1.5.12.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.10.1.1.
1.1.5.12.4. Pro: The vast majority of abortions performed in the U.S. are not medically necessary \([Finer et al, p. 110](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/journals/3711005.pdf)\).
1.1.5.12.4.1. Pro: In 1967, Planned Parenthood director Alan Guttermatch [wrote](https://www.hli.org/resources/does-legal-abortion-save-lives/) in "Abortion - Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow" that, "Today it is possible for almost any patient to be brought through pregnancy alive, unless she suffers from a fatal illness such as cancer or leukemia, and, if so, abortion would be unlikely to prolong, much less save, life."
1.1.5.12.4.1.1. Con: Planned Parenthood at this time was controlled by the Republican Party, which wanted to [expand](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8274866) its electoral base to [opponents of abortion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/how-the-republican-party-became-pro-life/2012/03/09/gIQAZcD31R_blog.html?utm_term=.944878b92d9d) after it had been a pro-life party for years. It is thus difficult to tell whether these statements by Planned Parenthood representatives were based on political imperatives at the time or genuine medical evidence - especially since the organisation later changed its stance to emphasising the [health benefits](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IfYodo2HIHgJ:https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/4713/9611/5762/Abortion_Medical_and_Social_Benefits.pdf+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=tw) of abortion and defending [access to abortion](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues).
1.1.5.12.4.2. Pro: In 1960, the then medical director of Planned Parenthood Mary Caldone, [stated](http://goo.gl/aByHQX) "medically speaking, that is from the point of view of the diseases of various systems, cardiac, genitourinary, and so on, it is hardly ever necessary to consider the life of a mother threatened by a pregnancy."
1.1.5.12.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.12.4.1.1.
1.1.5.12.5. Pro: [In a study looking at findings from 14 countries](http://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824\(17\)30188-9/fulltext), socioeconomic concerns and limiting family size were the main reasons given by women seeking abortions.
1.1.5.12.6. Pro: Most [women around the world](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-worldwide) seek abortions as a recourse for an unintended pregnancy because they did not want to become pregnant in the first place, and not because it is a medical necessity.
1.1.5.12.7. Con: Medical or not, having a child drastically changes your life.
1.1.5.12.7.1. Pro: According to a [study](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/08/11/the-most-depressing-statistic-imaginable-about-being-a-new-parent/) in Germany the negative effect of a new baby on a person's happiness in the first year is worse than divorce, unemployment and even the death of a partner.
1.1.5.12.7.1.1. Con: [A 2013 study at Princeton](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/4/1328.full.pdf) found next to no difference regarding overall life satisfaction between parents and non parents.
1.1.5.12.7.2. Pro: [Researchers](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0013969) found that the rate of the decline in relationship satisfaction is nearly twice as steep for couples who have children than for childless couples.
1.1.5.12.7.2.1. Pro: If the pregnancy is unplanned this satisfaction decrease is [steeper](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0893-3200.22.1.41).
1.1.5.12.7.2.2. Con: Abortion also causes relationship stress and [decline](https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/3804) at significant rates.
1.1.5.12.7.2.3. Con: Childless couples are a poor control group, since the majority \(61%\) of women who get abortions in the US [already have children.](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/10/most_surprising_abortion_statistic_the_majority_of_women_who_ter.html)
1.1.5.12.7.2.3.1. Con: This means that 39% of women who get an abortion in the US do not have children yet, which is still a substantial number.
1.1.5.12.7.3. Pro: New mothers can develop [social isolation](http://fortune.com/2016/05/09/mothers-marriage-parenthood/) and become disconnected from friends and colleagues due to the pressures of motherhood.
1.1.5.12.7.4. Con: Once the child has been born, he or she can be given to a family that wants a child. Apart from the medical and emotional issues of the pregnancy itself, the issues that come with having a child can be solved in a way that preserves the life of the child as well.
1.1.5.12.7.4.1. Con: [Statistically, one in three women](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/1-in-3-women-have-an-abortion-and-95-dont-regret-it-so-why-arent-we-talking-about-it-10392750.html) will have an abortion at some point in her life and there already is a lack of [foster families](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-foster-care-crisis-the-shortage-of-foster-parents_us_59072dcfe4b05279d4edbdd9). Hence, it is unlikely that there will be enough families to take in all the children that parents would rather have aborted.
1.1.5.12.7.5. Con: This is another argument that could justify killing a living child: "Trying to raise this two-month-old is drastically changing my life, and killing the child will stop that." An argument that easily translates to justifying the death of a child who has already been born is a poor argument for abortion.
1.1.5.12.7.6. Con: In the US, 61% of women who get abortions already have [at least one child](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/characteristics-us-abortion-patients-2008), so their life has already been changed by children.
1.1.5.13. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.4.
1.1.5.14. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.1.
1.1.5.15. Con: There is a difference between actively causing harm and allowing it to happen. Exercising the right to religious freedom in this manner does not actively cause harm, it only allows it to happen, because a woman is no worse off after the doctor's refusal than before.
1.1.5.15.1. Con: A doctor has a duty of care to their patients. In the modern hippocratic oath they acknowledge that they shall be a member of society with [special obligations](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/hippocratic-oath-today.html) to other humans. They have taken on the duty of action because of this.
1.1.5.15.1.1. Con: While doctors have a duty to act on behalf of their patients, they do not have to take everyone as a patient - they can refuse to enter into a doctor-patient relationship. If there is no emergency, a doctor can also terminate an existing relationship.
1.1.5.15.1.1.1. Con: The right to refuse patients is limited by discrimination laws in a number of countries.
1.1.5.15.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Some US states](https://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2012/09/07/discrimination-in-the-doctor-patient-relationship/) have laws applicable to medical contexts prohibiting discrimination on categories spanning gender, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, and medical condition.
1.1.5.15.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the US, doctors who receive federal funding are prohibited by the [Civil Rights Act](https://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2012/09/07/discrimination-in-the-doctor-patient-relationship/) from discriminating against patients based on race, color, religion, or national origin.
1.1.5.15.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: While discrimination against patients based on their vaccination status is not per se illegal, it would be illegal if this refusal is based on [religious beliefs](https://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2012/09/07/discrimination-in-the-doctor-patient-relationship/). By the same logic, inferring someone's sexual behaviour from their race, gender or religion and then refusing them as a patient on those grounds would likely also be considered discrimination.
1.1.5.15.1.1.1.3. Con: The question is in regards to ethics, not existing law. One cannot arrive at whether it is right to act or refuse to act simply by examining whether the state permits it. Law is derived from ethics, not the other way around.
1.1.5.15.1.2. Con: Since the vast majority of abortions are elective, not health care, doctors are not compelled to perform them because of their duty towards the health of the patient. A duty to act can only be invoked when there are serious health risks to the pregnant woman.
1.1.5.15.1.3. Con: Even if there is a duty to act, it does not follow that an abortion is the only way to help the patient. If the patient refuses all alternative treatments, the doctor is not obliged to perform the only remaining one, just as he is not obliged to act if the patient refuses all treatments.
1.1.5.15.1.3.1. Pro: The [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) states that, "Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course. Similarly I will not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion. But I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art.", which clearly prohibits abortion.
1.1.5.15.1.3.1.1. Con: The Hippocratic Oath has been changed significantly in order to adapt to changing times and [only 8% of modern versions](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/hippocratic-oath-today.html) still include a ban on abortion.
1.1.5.15.1.3.2. Pro: The [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) states that, "I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury and wrong-doing." - the "judgement" part suggests that the doctor has to evaluate which treatments are acceptable in which circumstances.
1.1.5.15.2. Con: Willingly allowing harm to happen is morally wrong.
1.1.5.15.2.1. Pro: In Germany, [failure to provide assistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_rescue#Germany) is considered a crime if providing assistance would not lead to danger to health or life.
1.1.5.15.2.2. Pro: [Consequentialism](http://www.iep.utm.edu/conseque/) is the theory that the overall consequences are what decide the morality of an action or lack of action. If this is to be followed then due to the fact that the end result would be the same, whether you allowed the harm to take place or did it yourself, both are morally wrong.
1.1.5.15.2.2.1. Con: While consequentialism judges the impact of an action, it is not only the immediate impact. Allowing harm to occur may have overall beneficial consequences in the long term, especially if there is a reasonable principle behind the refusal to intervene.
1.1.5.15.2.2.2. Con: The view that only the immediate result determines the morality of an action or inaction is untenable, because it would lead to absurd moral judgments. For example, since the result of murder, negligent homicide and homicide in self defense have the same result, they would be morally equivalent. Likewise, pushing somebody into the water to drown would be morally equivalent to not jumping in to rescue them, or even trying and failing to rescue them, because the result would be the same.
1.1.5.15.2.2.3. Pro: Morality is a deeply [biased](http://thephilosophyclass.blogspot.ie/2010/01/17-defense-of-consequentialism.html) concept. Every person, depending on their own beliefs, has a different opinion of what is morally correct. Due to this, analysing the consequences of actions or lack of actions is the only way to objectively look at morality. We can see what is moral or not by whether it produces a good or bad outcome.
1.1.5.15.2.2.3.1. Con: Whether an outcome is good or bad, right or wrong is also subjective. Therefore, analysing the consequences of actions is not necessarily an objective means of looking at morality.
1.1.5.15.2.3. Pro: In [France](https://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/public-law/no-legal-duty-to-save-someone-in-distress-law-essays.php) you can be charged with imprisonment if you fail to aid a third party who is in danger or injured. Their legal system claims that allowing harm to happen is a punishable offence.
1.1.5.15.2.4. Con: Allowing harm to happen may be beneficial to the afflicted in the long term. If a person makes bad decisions that threaten to harm them \(in a non-permanent way\), letting them face the consequences may lead to better decisions in the future, thus improving their life and the lives of those around them.
1.1.5.15.2.4.1. Pro: Gambling or drug addicts as well as alcoholics often have to hit rock bottom before they are willing to reform themselves. Giving them money to pay for utilities bills, car loans and mortgages in order to prevent them from losing electricity, their car or their house only enables them to continue their self-destructive behavior.
1.1.5.15.2.5. Con: Allowing harm to happen is sometimes beneficial to society at large. If a person suffers or even dies as a consequence of their own bad decisions, they can serve as an example to others, and as a point of reference for teaching children and juveniles about the dangers of reckless behavior.
1.1.5.15.2.5.1. Pro: Social observation allows us to [acquire fears](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/2/1/3/2362880) without ever being personally exposed to the aversive stimulus.
1.1.5.15.2.5.1.1. Con: It is common knowledge that smoking can lead to numerous [health issues](https://www.healthline.com/health/smoking/effects-on-body). Warning labels on cigarette packets make the risks associated with smoking even more explicit. However, individuals still take up smoking and it remains [popular](https://www.salon.com/2013/11/09/teens_have_started_smoking_again_because_they_think_its_cool_partner/).
1.1.5.15.2.5.1.1.1. Con: [Compliance with warning labels increases](http://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/psychwarnings.html) if the viewer has first-hand knowledge of people being injured in a similar situation.
1.1.5.15.2.5.1.2. Con: One might assume death to be the ultimate deterrent, yet there is no evidence that the [death penalty deters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/30/theres-still-no-evidence-that-executions-deter-criminals/) crime.
1.1.5.15.2.5.2. Pro: The alternative would be trying to eliminate any harmful consequences, which is a principle that cannot be followed practically, because people who make bad decisions would have no incentive to improve their decision-making if they do not have to bear the consequences of their actions. Thus, the cost of alleviating harm would continually increase.
1.1.5.15.2.5.3. Con: This is mere speculation, while preventing harm from happening when one is able to do so is a certainty. It is unclear why potential spurious future benefits should outweigh clear harms that can be avoided today.
1.1.5.15.2.5.4. Con: If we voluntarily allow people to suffer or even die by refusing aid we are providing a bad example for children and juveniles. Using these instances as a point of reference also teaches children lack of compassion and empathy.
1.1.5.15.2.5.4.1. Con: Empathy and compassion are virtues only in the context of reciprocal relationships. There are many cases in which "helping" another person will only drain your energy and resources, without improving the recipient's life, because they do not wish to make the necessary changes.
1.1.5.15.2.5.5. Con: If we followed the logic in this claim we would not give care to people who are suffering from illnesses caused by smoking, people who decided against wearing safety equipment and so were injured and many other instances when a persons actions contributed to their own suffering.
1.1.5.15.2.5.5.1. Con: This logic only dictates that we should not subsidize their health care, not that they should not be able to buy it. Letting people suffer the consequences in this case means that if people choose to go without health insurance, or take risks that are not covered by the insurance, nobody should be forced to pay for their health care, even if that means they do not get treatment.
1.1.5.15.2.5.5.1.1. Con: In this scenario abortion would be a legitimate response as the women who is pregnant would have to pay for her abortion and so pay for the consequences in the same way that these other examples would.
1.1.5.15.2.5.5.1.2. Pro: Any system of risk-pooling should be set up so that nobody can offload the cost of their personal risks on others against their will. Insurance is based on assessing the individual risk accurately and basing the premiums on that risk assessment, or even rejecting the application if the risk is too high. Otherwise, you would have to overcharge low-risk people in order to subsidize high-risk people, which requires coercion and leads to people taking higher risks because it costs them nothing.
1.1.5.15.2.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.15.2.5.1.1.1.
1.1.5.15.3. Pro: The [act-omission doctrine](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199676552.001.0001/acprof-9780199676552-chapter-3) holds that in some instances of harm, it is morally worse to cause the harm rather than to just let it happen.
1.1.5.15.3.1. Pro: A sharp distinction is drawn between active and passive euthanasia, between killing and letting die \([McLachlan, p. 2](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/27720159.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A8aaa981b2bc424536471a0e31a071e4e)\).
1.1.6. Pro: When a health care provider refuses to do their job for personal reasons, they are acting unethically by abandoning their [fiduciary duty](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fiduciary_duty) to patients.
1.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.3.
1.1.6.2. Con: According to standards set by the General Medical Council, physicians in the UK are permitted to opt out of certain procedures if it goes against their [personal beliefs](http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/21177.asp) as long as doing so does not discriminate against certain groups of people, and the patient is aware of such objections in advance.
1.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.12.
1.1.7. Con: Forcing someone to do something they consider to be unethical is unethical.
1.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Those with conscientious objections to abortion generally base this in the belief that abortion is murder, as mentioned in the intro to this discussion, and hence view abortion as unethical. Regardless of whether the mother agrees, or whether or not it is a true characterization of abortion or not, forcing the doctor to terminate an unborn human life would be forcing him or her to participate in what he or she views as unethical murder.
1.1.7.3. Pro: If a doctor has a conscientious objection to abortion, because they feel it is murder, then forcing them to preform an abortion is the same as forcing them to commit murder.
1.1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.2.2.1.
1.1.7.5. Con: People are not being forced to become doctors that perform abortions in the first place. They are free to choose another profession or any other medical fields.
1.1.7.5.1. Pro: If someone is uncomfortable with abortion, there are many medical fields they can enter where they will not be required to perform abortions. They do not need the right of conscientious objection to enter another field of medicine.
1.1.7.5.1.1. Con: Forcing professionals who serve in this sub-specialty to provide a service they may find morally abhorrent would reduce the number of qualified candidates choosing to pursue the field in the first place, reducing the number of specialists in the field.
1.1.7.5.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.1.7.5.1.2. Con: It is traditionally gynaecologists who perform abortions. Gynaecologists should have an equal right to conscientious objection as other doctors.
1.1.7.5.2. Con: If society disallows conscientious objectors from practicing or entering their field of choice, it will be a step backwards for human rights.
1.1.7.5.2.1. Pro: The European Union charter of fundamental human rights [states](http://fra.europa.eu/en/charterpedia/article/15-freedom-choose-occupation-and-right-engage-work), "Everyone has the right to engage in work and to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation."
1.1.7.5.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.1.7.5.2.1.2. Con: Many professions are already subject to restrictions which society considers legitimate, such as a certain level of education, or conforming to certain ethical requirements.
1.1.7.5.2.1.3. Pro: Banning future conscientious objectors from entering a field of medicine that requires the performance of abortions would violate their right to pursue a freely chosen career.
1.1.7.5.2.1.4. Pro: Penalizing current conscientious objectors for continuing to practice in their fields or forcing them to stop practicing medicine would violate their right to work in an accepted occupation.
1.1.7.5.3. Con: A doctor cannot switch medical fields without a great cost of [money, time, and effort](https://www.aamc.org/cim/career/professionaldevelopment/switchingspecialties/). Switching would require several more years of expensive medical school and leave the doctor without salary in the meantime.
1.1.7.5.3.1. Con: Once a law against conscientious objection is in place, medical students opposed to abortion can simply decide not to become gynaecologists in the first place, so there is no need for them to switch fields.
1.1.8. Con: Most doctors who are prepared to perform an abortion have pre-conceived rules about who they will perform it on, e.g. not performing abortions where the [pregnancy is too far along.](http://www.latimes.com/la-na-abortdoc22may22-story.html) The idea of it being unethical is solely based on their view on it. [Ethics are subjective.](http://www.wesleyan.edu/ethics/teaching/media/classroom/question2.html)
1.1.8.1. Con: [Ethics are objective.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_universalism)
1.1.8.1.1. Con: If morality were universal, all humans could be expected to hold the [same moral values](https://philosophynow.org/issues/115/Is_Morality_Objective). However, this is not the case, implying that morality is relative.
1.1.8.1.1.1. Con: The lack of moral consensus has no bearing on whether or not morality is universal or not. To be sure, the lack of consensus only indicates that there is a lack of consensus and a large degree of difficulty in proving one side or the other.
1.1.8.1.1.2. Pro: The moral principles and conceptions that people hold highly depend on the social context, different religions and ideologies.
1.1.8.1.1.3. Con: The expectation that all human beings should hold the same moral values is unrealistic. A more accurate criteria for objectivity would be that most people adhere to some general set of practices and value some basic principles.
1.1.8.1.1.4. Pro: Whether morality is universal or relative is a highly contentious question. There is no reason to assume that moral universalism is more true than its opposing point of view, [moral relativism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/).
1.1.8.1.1.5. Con: This could also be the result of morality being universal and objective, but most humans being immoral and adhering to incorrect moral principles.
1.1.8.1.2. Pro: There are some acts that all people would intuitively agree are wrong, such as genocide and other war crimes. The [UN Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) and the [Rome Statute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Statute_of_the_International_Criminal_Court) can be considered attempts at codifying these agreements.
1.1.8.1.2.1. Con: Just because all of humanity may hold consensus as to the moral state of any act, does not mean ethics are objective. It simply means that at any given time, all people may agree on the value of an act. Ethics can only be objective if based on something external to human consensus.
1.1.8.2. Pro: In a country where euthanasia is legal, a doctor who believes it's unethical to kill a person \(even if the person wants to die\) should not be required to help kill them. A doctor should always have the freedom to refuse to do a procedure that they believe to run counter to their own sense of ethics.
1.1.8.3. Pro: Ethics may be objective, but not everybody agrees on what the objective truth is. Not long ago, American society held that it was unethical/immoral for people of two races to get married, and that giving kids certain drugs was fine. Changing societal opinion shouldn't override an individual's convictions about objective ethical truth.
1.1.8.4. Con: Personal ethics may be subjective but professional ethics are objectively defined.
1.2. Con: Such a policy would be counterproductive and hurt the women it aims to protect.
1.2.1. Pro: Regardless of the intentions behind the proposal of such a policy, it will be perceived as an attack on the freedom of religion. Right-wing political groups that already oppose the encroachment of the state in the personal sphere, use such instances for propaganda purposes. This makes it likelier for people to [support or vote](https://www.edge.org/conversation/jonathan_haidt-what-makes-people-vote-republican) for right-wing groups.
1.2.1.1. Pro: People above the age of 60 [vote more](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-decision-tree/201109/why-do-old-people-vote-more) than their younger counterparts and are more likely to be [religious.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/culture-conscious/201602/why-are-old-people-so-religious) If this issue is framed as a religious one on the national political agenda, they are likelier to support right-wing political parties which means that right-wing political parties are likely to win elections.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: If elected to government, right-wing groups are likely to roll back on welfare programs like [Planned Parenthood](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/us/politics/planned-parenthood-trump.html?mcubz=1). In the process of this, not only do they harm women seeking access to abortion but also women seeking access to[healthcare services](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/04/health/planned-parenthood-by-the-numbers/index.html) provided by such programs.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Without Planned Parenthood many patients would have no alternative options for accessing care. In [more than 20%](https://www.istandwithpp.org/defund-defined/impact-defunding-planned-parenthood) of the counties where Planned Parenthood health centers operate, there are no other health care providers who serve patients who rely on safety-net providers.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: In Texas, one [study](http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Texas-pregnancy-related-deaths-double-9172022.php) found that pregnancy-related deaths doubled after the state stopped reimbursing Planned Parenthood and imposed stringent funding cuts for women’s health — and 54% fewer patients in the state received care.
1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: In [Wisconsin](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/planned-parenthood-congress-wisconsin-texas), fewer women could access lifesaving cancer screenings following the closure of Planned Parenthood health centers.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Far right-wing groups that are anti-abortion and in some cases violent, are also likelier to [gather more support.](https://sustainablesecurity.org/2017/09/12/what-drives-far-right-terrorism-in-the-united-states/) This may lead to an increase in attacks on abortion clinics or doctors performing abortions.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Any policy that makes access to abortion easier, is bound to infuriate far right-wing groups. Violence is regrettable and civilians should be protected from it, but violence alone is not reason enough for the state to not pass policies that increase access to reproductive healthcare for women.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Increasing attacks against reproductive healthcare officials may discourage people from entering the field in the future.
1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Threats of violence or actual violence may result in reproductive healthcare officials leaving their profession.
1.2.1.3. Con: People do not vote on the basis of religion alone, rather they vote based on [multiple issues.](http://www.people-press.org/2016/07/07/4-top-voting-issues-in-2016-election/)
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.9.
1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.
1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.2.5. Pro: Banning Conscientious objection can punish doctors who may object to an abortion for specific legitimate reasons \(such as family or partner coercion rather than direct choice of the mother\).  There is a wide variety of possible reasons for someone to object and the law is far to blunt a tool to prohibit them all.
1.3. Pro: Conscientious objection is discriminatory and undermines women's rights.
1.3.1. Pro: Picking and choosing what parts of the job to do and whom to serve would be unacceptable in any other profession. There is no reason to treat doctors any differently.
1.3.1.1. Con: Nobody has the right to the labor of someone else. All services \(including medical\) should be entered into voluntarily on both sides. If one party doesn't consent to being a part of it, he or she should be able to opt out for any reason.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Vegans working at a supermarket would still be expected to ring up the meat product bought by a customer.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: This example is irrelevant: If the vegan refused to ring up meat then they might be fired by the people who own the grocery store. They would not face criminal charges or legal repercussions, which is what the debate is about.
1.3.1.3. Con: This is something that should be determined at the market level and not at the legal level. A doctor who doesn't want to perform abortions may be fired by his employer but should not face criminal/legal repercussions.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: If a janitor doesn't want to clean up a mess, the janitor might be fired. They won't face legal repercussions though.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Boycotting Jewish businesses or refusing Jewish customers as happened during the Third Reich in Germany is now widely regarded as [absolutely unacceptable](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007459), even if the reason were religious.
1.3.1.5. Con: We allow people to refuse to do [dangerous work](https://www.osha.gov/right-to-refuse.html). An argument can be made that forcing a doctor to violate their ethical beliefs could harm their mental or emotional health.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.5.
1.3.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.3.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.
1.3.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.5.
1.3.1.6. Con: In the [UK](https://books.google.ie/books?id=EiAcBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=conscientious+objection+abortion+indirect+contact&source=bl&ots=u_7tW2mS4h&sig=-G6qbydsY6lmPw7wjVWYXyMrhtI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjnnoKv-b_WAhVJJsAKHRLWDTUQ6AEISDAI#v=onepage&q=conscientious%20objection%20abortion%20indirect%20contact&f=false) \(pp.102\), Sikh construction workers have special allowances to not wear hard hats instead of turbans despite this going against health and safety legislation.
1.3.1.6.1. Con: Not wearing a helmet only affects the person not wearing it. Refusing to perform a medical procedure affects the person to whom the service is being denied.
1.3.1.7. Pro: Counselors and students in counseling programs have refused to see LGBT patients, saying it goes against their religious faith, and have subsequently been fired or dismissed from their programs because it was determined that their actions constituted discrimination. \([Francis, slides 4-7, 16-18](https://www.txca.org/images/tca/Documents/Conference/PGC13/Handouts/101.pdf)\)
1.3.1.8. Pro: The [cab-rank rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cab-rank_rule) is applied to lawyers in many countries, and states that lawyers cannot refuse work in their field as long as they are paid their usual rates.
1.3.1.8.1. Con: This rule is not applied in the United States except, arguably, to criminal defense attorneys.
1.3.2. Con: Places that allow conscientious objection consider abortion legal, but not a right. For this to be a valid statement, there needs to be another debate on whether or not abortion is a right.
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.1.1.
1.3.4. Con: If a medical provider refuses to provide care before the point where it become neglect or patient abandonment, they are exercising their same right to choose as those who support a mother's "right to choose" claim she is exercising.
1.3.5. Pro: Medical practitioners who have no stake in the safety, raising, or adoption of the unaborted have no ethical ground on which to protest.
1.3.6. Pro: Women should have the ability to access legal and safe abortions if that is what they desire.
1.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.5.
1.3.6.3. Pro: If the majority of doctors in a given place, such as [Italy](https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/claudia-torrisi/abortion-italy-conscientious-objection), refuse to perform abortions, difficulty in finding a willing doctor could cause a woman to run out of time and ultimately not be able to get the procedure performed.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.5.4.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: Outside doctors can be called into hospitals for terminations in the first trimester. Abortions after the first trimester require the doctor to be a [member of staff](https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/claudia-torrisi/abortion-italy-conscientious-objection). A lack of doctors who do not conscientiously object could be problematic in these cases.
1.3.6.4. Con: A person seeking a service has to find someone willing to provide that service. Using the power of the state to coerce somebody to provide you with what you want is immoral, because it violates not only their freedom of association, but in this case also their freedom of conscience.
1.3.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.3.6.4.2. Pro: The state has a monopoly on the use of force, and as such is the single largest concentration of potential violence in every society. Using this overwhelming force to threaten somebody with punishment in order to make them provide a service to you is morally equivalent to making a comparable threat yourself. If it is immoral to issue the threat yourself, it is immoral to use the state to do it.
1.3.6.5. Con: A large group of people wanting something is not sufficient reason to allow them access to it, let alone provide it against the will of others.
1.3.6.5.1. Con: There is a large difference between want and need and in the case of abortion, it is very easy to misconceive someone's need for a want. As we are unable to fully assess someone's mental ability to have a child, we cannot tell if the abortion is necessary for their mental health or not. This is especially true in instances of rape, which a large percentage of women do not report.
1.3.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.1.
1.3.6.7. Pro: Abortion was, is and always will be the mother's decision. She doesn't need anyone's "permission" to do what she wants. A woman could have an unwanted pregnancy at a very young age and it is not the father's, the government's or anybody else's decision if she should keep the baby or not. What happens to the baby will mostly affect the mother because it's her body and by taking away this decision, the government is slowly stripping women of their rights.
1.3.6.7.1. Con: If a mother has a right to her body, a doctor has a right to theirs.
1.3.6.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.3.6.7.2. Con: This argues for a woman's right to perform an abortion on herself or to have help from someone willing. It doesn't provide support for forcing someone to help against their will.
1.3.6.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.1.1.
1.3.7. Con: The right to abortion, like the right to free speech, is a [liberty right](http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2010/10/1922/), in that a person is allowed to do an action, but other persons have no duty to assist that person in doing said action. The right to free speech implies that a person may speak, but there is no duty for others to help the agent speak, say by providing air time on television.
1.3.7.1. Con: If all doctors had and used the right to conscientious objection, women would not effectively have the right to access abortion, since they would not be able to access them in reality. Hence, there clearly needs to be a point at which the state ensures that a sufficient number of practicing doctors are willing to perform abortions.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: There will always be a conscientious objection right - people will simply choose not to be doctors. This will restrict the supply of practitioners, make medical care more expensive and less efficient and thus endanger potential patients.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: The US already faces a [shortage](https://www.thecut.com/2017/07/ob-gyn-shortage-health-threat-doximity.html) of obstretic gynaecologists \(OB/GYNs\), which would be exacerbated by any policies that could further reduce the number of medical students entering this particular field.
1.3.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: Rural areas already have [limited healthcare options](https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/healthcare-access), which exacerbates the negative impact on health care options available to women in these areas.
1.3.7.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.5.9.3.2.
1.3.7.1.1.2. Con: Unless it is for the purposes of sex selection, [between 80 and 90%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4185126/) of US gynaecologists would provide their patients with an abortion, regardless of whether they personally object to it.
1.3.7.1.1.3. Con: More likely, those particular individuals will choose specialities where they are unlikely to be asked to perform an abortion, and the marginal decrease in competitiveness for the specialities that do carry a likelihood of that will draw those who might have chosen other specialities to those fields. This is unlikely to have an effect on the quality of medical care available after that self-sorting.
1.3.7.1.1.3.1. Con: Emergency room doctors can do anything medically necessary to save the patient. This includes abortion. Therefore this entire line of debate could, in theory, lead to the depletion of ER talent.
1.3.7.1.1.3.2. Con: If the number of conscientious objectors is small, their withdrawal from the market has little impact on the supply of doctors for women. Allowing them to refuse to perform abortions doesn't affect the women and, given their care isn't impacted, the doctors should not be required to carry out abortion procedures.
1.3.7.1.1.3.3. Con: If conscientious objection is indeed widespread enough to meaningfully restrict access to abortions, then banning it would have a large impact on supply and negatively impact women’s ability to find affordable care. Therefore, doctors should not be required to perform abortions.
1.3.7.1.1.4. Pro: Most conscientious objectors have [7 to 11 years of education](http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/13/mid.life.doctors/index.html) including college and medical school, plus the experience of post-med school [internships and residencies](https://study.com/become_an_obgyn.html), and the experience of any medical work since. To pull these highly trained practitioners from the workforce would be a huge detriment to women's maternal health.
1.3.7.1.1.4.1. Con: Due to the current state of the medical field, changing one's specialization has become a more common practice, and thus the process has become more streamlined.
1.3.7.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: One benefit of being a "[nontraditional resident](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/703442#vp_2)" is that doctors may be exempt from the traditional application process, granting additional flexibility.
1.3.7.1.1.4.2. Con: This would only be the case for a small number of doctors who are already in their field of specialisation when such a law is implemented. Any future doctor will be able to this choice fully conscious of the legal situation and not incur any costs resulting from having to switch to another field.
1.3.7.1.2. Con: There is no right to actually get any service, there is only a right not to be prevented from accessing a service by the state. If there were a right to get a service, this would impose a duty to perform the service on those capable of doing so, which is incompatible with personal liberty. In other words, if there is no one willing to sell, then you cannot buy - forcing somebody to sell is immoral.
1.3.7.1.2.1. Pro: If there were such a duty, service providers could not charge anything for their services, or the state would have to set the price. Otherwise, people who do not want to offer the service would just make it prohibitively expensive.
1.3.7.1.3. Con: If all doctors used the right to conscientious objection, the state should consider whether the act of abortion might perhaps be objectionable to the rational mind and change the law.
1.3.8. Con: Conscientious objection is not a denial of services to particular kinds of people, but rather a denial of particular kinds of actions. Doctors who exercise conscientious objections do not refuse to service women in all circumstances, they only refuse to perform abortions.
1.3.8.1. Con: Conscientious objection has a [disparate impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disparate_impact) on women, and therefore can be classified as discriminatory under Title VII of the [U.S. Civil Rights Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964).
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.3.8.1.2. Pro: Women living in areas with low health care coverage may need to travel long distances to get an abortion if the most readily available doctor is a conscientious objector. This imposes significant costs on them in terms of money and time.
1.3.8.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.1.4.
1.3.8.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.1.
1.3.8.1.2.3. Pro: If patients have to "shop around" in order to find a doctor who will perform their procedure this will financially impact them because they have to get more than one consultation. A significantly larger amount of time is also wasted for the patient.
1.3.8.1.3. Con: Policy relating to abortion mostly affect women by their very nature. This does not make them discriminatory.
1.3.8.1.3.1. Con: Men are affected by unwanted pregnancies too. Unwanted pregnancies can mean another mouth to feed or child support payments.
1.3.8.1.3.1.1. Con: It is far easier for men to not have to deal with pregnancy, childbirth, and raising children.
1.3.8.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Both parents have identical rights and responsibilities by law in the care-taking of children in most western countries \(see [European Law](http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/parental_resp/parental_resp_fra_en.htm#1.)\).
1.3.8.1.3.2. Pro: Only women can become pregnant, so they are always most immediately affected by policies relating to abortions.
1.3.8.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.1.
1.3.8.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.2.2.
1.3.8.1.6. Pro: Lack of access to reproductive healthcare, such as abortion, disproportionately impacts [poor women](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/unintended-pregnancy-united-states) and [women of color](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/unintended-pregnancy-united-states).
1.3.8.1.6.1. Pro: Statistics show that the women who are most likely to experience unwanted pregnancies are also those least well equipped to deal with the consequences \([Thomas and Monea, p. 2](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/07_unintended_pregnancy_thomas_monea.pdf)\).
1.3.8.1.6.1.1. Pro: Women without a high school degree have [the highest rate](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/unintended-pregnancy-united-states) of unintended pregnancies, and without at least a high school degree, job prospects and prospects for continuing education are low.
1.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.1.
1.3.10. Pro: When doctors refuse a woman an abortion, they undermine her bodily autonomy by forcing their beliefs on a deeply personal decision regarding that woman's own body.
1.3.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.10.2. Con: Forcing a gynecologist to either perform abortions or not practice gynecology violates the bodily automomy of the gynecologist.
1.3.10.3. Pro: Women who are feeling uncertain or stressed about their decision to seek an abortion may be particularly harmed by being confronted with a medical professional who does not believe in the right to an abortion.
1.3.10.3.1. Con: Abortion is unethical and it is perfectly legitimate for medical staff to refuse to perform an unethical medical procedure.
1.3.10.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.3.10.3.1.2. Con: Abortion is ethical.
1.3.10.3.1.2.1. Pro: It is more ethical to end an unwanted pregnancy than to bring an unwanted child into the world.
1.3.10.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: A child has a right not to be raised by a parent who doesn't want them, which would be impossible to disguise and deeply impact the child, having substantial [negative effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232137/) on their future mental health and ability to have meaningful relationships, as well as an [array](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/12_impact_unintended_childbearing_future_sawhill.pdf) of academic and social outcomes.
1.3.10.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This is tantamount to saying that killing a child preserves their right to not have an unhappy life, which is untrue. If a child is killed, it never even has the chance of having a happy life.
1.3.10.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: It is incorrect to say just because the mother does not want the child then the child is "unwanted". There are plenty of families who "want" and can adopt the child.
1.3.10.3.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.12.7.4.1.
1.3.10.3.1.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.2.1.1.2.
1.3.10.3.1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2. Pro: It is ethical for a woman to get an abortion if she does not have a responsible way to care for the potential child. Getting an abortion allows women to better look after their existing family and their own future.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1. Con: The problem is not the child, but the circumstances. Abortion is not the answer to [solving social issues like poverty](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/poverty/news/2014/09/17/97287/the-top-10-solutions-to-cut-poverty-and-grow-the-middle-class/).
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: If women could not have abortions so easily, governments [would have to put more money](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/mother/against_1.shtml) into social programs.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.3.2.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Governments can choose to put money into social programs. They do not necessarily have to.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Governments, like the [Trump administration](http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37468751), that are closely associated with reducing funding for abortion services are also closely associated with reducing federal funding for welfare projects. It is unlikely that these governments will choose to redistribute money saved from abortion services to projects that specifically help women.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: The rise of the right wing in Europe means that governments are likely to [introduce restrictions](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/wje8k9/why-the-rise-of-the-european-right-spells-doom-for-reproductive-health) aimed at reducing access to abortions and are unlikely to [increase welfare](http://www.spicker.uk/social-policy/politics.htm) for any group let alone women.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Women should [not have to choose](http://www.feministsforlife.org/question-abortion/) between a career and/or education and a child. Rather than focusing on abortion, society should focus on addressing the reasons why women seek abortions. Policies that would help women be students and workers and mothers at the same time, such as telecommuting, paid parental leave, and affordable child care and housing, are what is needed for true gender equality, not abortion.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Many women who get abortions do so because they feel they have [no other recourse](http://www.feministsforlife.org/if-you-dont-trust-me-with-a-choice-how-can-you-trust-me-with-a-child/), and "a coerced decision is not a free choice."
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: An uncoerced decision requires the decision-maker to act voluntarily, free of coercion and pressures. In contrast, a coerced decision, by definition, means a distinct lack of choice. \([Shapira, 140 & 141](https://books.google.com/books?id=-TvzCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&dq=coerced+decision+is+not+a+free+choice&source=bl&ots=ChBR5IyCU5&sig=i_eRjHyX6y5bjeOt2akIuGhXoHk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8pImfmMbWAhWGNxQKHYtNABYQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q=coerced%20decision%20is%20not%20a%20free%20choice&f=false)\)
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Philosophers tend to define coercion as a type of control that forces the individual to do or not do something they would not have chosen to do otherwise. Coercion intrudes on freedom because part of freedom is being able to make one's own choices \([Carr, p. 59](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20014223?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\). Thus, if a woman feels forced into getting an abortion by her circumstances, getting an abortion cannot be considered a free choice.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.2.2. Con: All adult human beings who are in the labor force are caught in situations where they inevitably have to choose between family and work.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.2.3. Con: Getting an abortion is a legitimate choice even if governments create programs aimed at helping women with children. Mothers would have to lead hectic and tiring lives even with this help. They should be able to choose not to.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.2.4. Con: Women do not have abortions due to a fear of current or future socioeconomic circumstances alone. 48% of women had abortions because they did not want to be single mothers or were having relationship problems. Governments may be able to help mothers get education and jobs but they can not regulate against this. \([Finer et al; p.g 1](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/journals/3711005.pdf)\)
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.2.4.1. Con: One of the reasons women may not want to be single mothers is the lack of financial support from the government, which could easily be mitigated through policy changes.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.2.4.2. Pro: Women often want abortions because of relationship problems with their partners which can include the partner’s drinking, physical abuse, unfaithfulness, unreliability, immaturity and absence \(often due to incarceration or responsibilities to his other children\). \([Finer et al; p.g 7](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/journals/3711005.pdf)\)
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.3. Con: The desire to not have a child is not always related to specific circumstances, but is sometimes as simple as not wanting to carry and give birth to a child.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: In 2005, the [top answers](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states#5a) given for getting an abortion included responsibilities to others and being unable to afford having a child.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.4.
1.3.10.3.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Raising a child [can cost over $230,000](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html), not including the cost of college.
1.3.10.3.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.5.
1.3.10.3.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.3.10.3.1.3. Pro: It is unfair to force medical professionals to end a life because of choices made by someone else. It should be up to them whether they want to take on that burden or not.
1.3.10.3.1.3.1. Con: We expect medical professionals to treat all people equally, as part of the Hippocratic oath they take. This cannot be violated simply because of the choices a person makes.
1.3.10.3.1.3.1.1. Con: The original Hippocratic oath [explicitly forbade abortion](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_oath.html).
1.3.10.3.1.3.1.2. Pro: We would expect medical professionals to treat smokers and obese people equally, even though some of their medical conditions could be as a result of personal choices.
1.3.10.3.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Problems such as lung cancer from smoking and heart disease from obesity are not similar to pregnancy. If you consider the definition of a medical condition, pregnancy is not [one](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/medical+condition). Without complications, pregnacy is within the range of normal biological states. In most cases, it is not life threatening. It could and should be considered potential for life, or even a new life, rather than a problem.
1.3.10.3.1.3.1.3. Pro: It is not the place of a medical professional to make a moral judgment about their patients. They should all be treated equally and given access to all treatments.
1.3.10.3.1.3.1.4. Con: Refusing abortion services is not a matter of failing to treat people equally. Conscientious objectors to abortion have a problem with the act of abortion, regardless of who is requesting it.
1.3.10.3.1.3.2. Con: The decision to have sex or to have sex without protection is not always a choice.
1.3.10.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: Many women suffer severe side effects from hormonal birth control, including [depression](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/10/09/497087838/does-some-birth-control-raise-depression-risk-thats-complicated), while others have health conditions that may be [aggravated](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-safe-is-the-birth-control-pill) by hormonal birth control. This often leaves them no choice but to rely on less efficient contraceptive methods such as condoms if they want to have sex.
1.3.10.3.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.12.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4. Con: People can only be held responsible for informed choices that they have made. Contraception and education about contraception is not always readily available. In such a case, it is nobody's fault or choice that a woman is seeking an abortion.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.1. Con: This should be solved through education and spreading public awareness, not by killing unborn children.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.1.1. Con: Most abortions are not performed late enough in pregnancy to count as killing unborn children.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.2. Con: People can also be held accountable for negligence, and for things they do under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and for things they do in the heat of passion. While these circumstances mitigate their responsibility somewhat, people are still held responsible.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3. Con: If a woman knows about abortion, it is safe to assume that she also knows about contraception - education not being available is therefore no viable excuse.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.5.3.2.2.1.1.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.2. Con: Knowing about something's existence does not mean you are adequately educated.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3. Con: The problem with contraception related education is not that people need to know it exists, but how to use it properly.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.1. Con: Information about different contraceptive methods is available online and at various counseling institutions - it is even taught at schools. Information about the correct use of a particular contraceptive comes with the packaging, or can be obtained from the doctor prescribing it or the pharmacist selling it.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.1.1. Con: Only [40](http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/)% of the world has access to the internet.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.1.2. Con: Only 24 States in [America](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-policies-on-sex-education-in-schools.aspx) mandate sexual education. 4 States require parental consent before a child can engage in this education and 35 states allow a parent to opt their child out of it. This shows that many children do not have access to sexual education in school in the US.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.1.2.1. Con: The lack of sexual education points to the fact that states must be compelled to provide sexual education. It does not lead to the conclusion that the right to abortion must be provided.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.1.2.1.1. Con: This may be theoretically possible, but such legislation is unlikely to be passed in states controlled by Tea Party Republicans whose base primarily consists of [religious voters](http://www.pewforum.org/2011/02/23/tea-party-and-religion/) who are opposed to such education.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.1.3. Con: [Labels](https://www.bedsider.org/features/239-what-s-in-a-birth-control-label) with birth control are known to be difficult to understand and are often not updated at the same rate as medical knowledge.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.1.3.1. Con: If labels are difficult to understand, perhaps the best solution to the problem is making them easier to understand rather than allowing abortions.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.1.3.2. Con: Labels related to a lot of products are difficult to understand. This difficulty however still does not allow people to sue companies if they have been harmed by specific products, in the case where such risks were made explicit.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.1.4. Con: For those who do get information online they are likely to get incorrect information. Anyone can post online, information is not policed and so people can be easily mislead.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.1.4.1. Con: A lack of accurate information on contraception techniques and their use on the internet suggests that states must try to police information concerning contraceptives. It does not lead to the conclusion, however that women should be allowed to access abortion.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.1.4.2. Con: Women can always choose to access government websites or websites run by international organisations like the United Nations for accurate information.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.2. Pro: As of 2003, nearly half of the adult US population had [inadequate literacy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037129/), which means that the majority of people probably are unable to parse information on complicated drug labels. This literacy gap can also cause communication issues between doctors and patients.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.3. Pro: Depending on which kind of hormonal birth control a woman uses and when she starts taking it, it can take [no time, 48 hours or seven days](http://www.refinery29.com/how-does-the-pill-work) until the pill starts to become effective.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.4. Pro: Especially information on what to do when missing the pill once, twice, or three times is often poorly understood or [not adequately conveyed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23040136) to patients.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.4. Con: If contraception is not readily available, there are still ways to avoid pregnancy, abstinence being one of them. The sexual partners are therefore responsible for the pregnancy, to the extent that they knew about the lack of contraception and agreed to sex anyway.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.4.1. Con: Most of these [methods](http://www.thelaboroflove.com/articles/how-can-i-avoid-getting-pregnant-without-using-contraceptives) are not a hundred per cent effective. Therefore there would still be a chance of pregnancy.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: For every hundred couples using the pull out method [four](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method/how-effective-is-withdrawal-method-pulling-out) will get pregnant.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.4.1.2. Pro: The Fertility Awareness Method is only [76%](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness) effective
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.4.1.3. Con: Avoiding sexual intercourse, by either refraining from sexual activity altogether, or by limiting oneself to other practices, is a simple and obvious way to avoid pregnancy.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.4.1.3.1. Con: Some people have found abstinence to have [negative](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2011/11/the-purity-culture-and-sexual-dysfunction.html) psychological affects due to the repression of their sexual urges.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.4.2. Con: If someone is not educated in contraceptives it is unlikely they are educated in non contraceptive methods of avoiding pregnancy.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.3.4.4.1.3.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.5. Con: Even after the woman has become pregnant, there are several courses of action that she can pursue: she can give birth anonymously and abdicate responsibility for the baby, she can put the baby up for adoption regularly, she can seek assistance in caring for the baby, or she can take care of the baby herself, maybe in conjunction with the father. Abortion is only one of several options, so it is definitely the woman's choice to seek an abortion.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.5.1. Con: Staying pregnant and carrying the child to term often comes with monetary or health costs that women may not be able to afford. In these situations, they do not actually have a choice.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.3.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.4.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.2.2.2.2.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.5.1.4. Con: When you take an action, you have made a choice to act, as opposed to inaction. Seeking out an abortion is an action, whereas inaction would mean carrying the child to term and giving birth. The arrangement \(or lack thereof\) of prenatal care and the circumstances of the birth would be another set of choices, for which the woman will take her financial and social situation into account. There are many choices involved, and the woman has agency and autonomy with regards to these choices.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.5.2. Con: Women who have babies with birth defects or for whom the pregnancy is medically dangerous do not have a choice.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.12.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.5.2.2. Con: Women can choose to give up children with birth defects.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.6. Pro: In the [US](https://www.thoughtco.com/teen-pregnancy-and-abortion-rates-3534250), 67.8 in every thousand girls between the age of 15 and 17 become pregnant. Girls 14 or younger had a rate of 6.6 in every thousand getting pregnant. Minors cannot be expected to have a comprehensive knowledge of contraception.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.6.1. Con: If a minor is not competent to have sex responsibly, then the legal guardians have the duty to prevent them from engaging in sex at all. Furthermore, it is the parents' duty to educate their children about how to best deal with their sexual urges and members of the opposite sex in general, among many other things. Therefore, even in cases of teenage pregnancy, it is somebody's fault.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.6.1.1. Con: If we take this claim as correct then it can be assumed that the legal guardians of the minor should bear responsibility for the pregnancy. As it is impossible for them to perform the pregnancy for them, paying and providing for an abortion or care of medical needs throughout the pregnancy would be the only way they can take responsibility.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.6.1.2. Con: It can be taken from this claim that the unplanned pregnancy is the legal guardian's "fault". If this is the case then both minors involved in the pregnancy would not be required to deal with the consequences. Abortion in this case would then be justified as the pregnancy is not the pregnant minor's fault.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.7. Pro: Women living in poverty or who are not documented can find it [harder](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/11/contraceptive-deserts/505577/) to access contraception.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.7.1. Con: Everybody has to make decisions within their individual range of options. Since abstinence is always an option, lack of access to contraceptives is no excuse to have unprotected sex - the woman still makes an informed decision.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.7.2. Pro: In the US, hormonal birth control, which is one of the most effective methods available, can set women back between [$160 and $600](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2011/12/21/50-ways-to-improve-your-finances-in-2012) per year. Without health insurance and with a low income, this will be difficult to afford especially for low-income women.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.8. Pro: It has been [reported](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/advice/a6329/sex-ed-facts/) that a third of US teens have no education about contraceptives. By high school graduation, 41% knew very little about condoms, and 75% had never heard of the pill which is significantly more effective than condoms.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.3.4.3.3.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.10. Pro: When contraception became more accessible in Iowa by allowing doctors to prescribe it via video chat, [demand for abortion declined](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/10/how-far-will-you-have-to-drive-to-get-an-abortion/542061/) significantly. This indicates that a lot of women use contraception and avoid pregnancy entirely if possible, but are barred from accessing it by poor health care coverage.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.11. Pro: The philosopher Richard Dworkin argued that people cannot be held responsible for their circumstances. By this logic, a woman cannot be held responsible for growing up in circumstances where contraceptive methods and relevant information are difficult to access \([Scheffler, p. 2](http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/schefflersamuelvalueofequality.pdf)\).
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.11.1. Con: An individual's circumstances may reduce the degree of responsibility but do not take away all responsibility for their actions. Minors may be given lesser sentences if they commit crimes, but are given sentences nonetheless.
1.3.10.3.1.3.4.11.2. Pro: At its core, Dworkins' argument revolves around the principle that it is within our power to change some things, but not others. He argues that we should be held responsible for the former, but not the latter.
1.3.10.3.1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.3.10.3.1.3.6. Pro: Abortion is not, except where a woman's life is threatened, a 'treatment'.
1.3.10.3.1.4. Con: Whether or not abortion is considered unethical is a personal belief.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1. Pro: Personal beliefs have no place in the medical profession.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.1. Con: All beliefs of an individual are by definition personal, even if they are true. The key concept here is whether they are shared or not; if in a group everyone shares one's belief then it is thought of as knowledge or a fact, but it is still a personal belief. One cannot separate a person from their beliefs, and there's nothing wrong with enacting one's own beliefs.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2. Con: A doctor is not a public servant, they should be able to deny any service they wish. That might make them unpopular, or "wrong" by someone's standards, but any non-governmental professional should be protected in their own personal beliefs in this manner.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1. Con: It is perfectly legitimate for the government to regulate the behaviour and restrict the freedom of citizens who are not public servants.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: The state 'forces' people to do many things it believes necessary to protect the public and improve people's lives. The state forces people by making it illegal not to do certain things.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The fact that the state can sometimes ban people from doing certain things for the benefit of society does not prove that this is the case for conscientious objection to abortion.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Many governments make it illegal for individuals to not wear seat belts in recognition of the fact that they make being on the road much safer for everyone.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.8.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2. Pro: The state can use coercive measures - perhaps penalties imposed by hospitals or state licensing boards in the case of conscientious objectors -  to uphold the law and to force individuals to act against their conscience if it is deemed to be for the greater good \([Brock, p. 5](https://pmr.uchicago.edu/sites/pmr.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/Brock,%20Conscientious%20refusal%20by%20physicians%20and%20pharmacists.pdf)\).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.1. Con: This is totally dependent upon the definition of "greater good." If the motivation behind aborting your child is sexism, few people would promote that as a greater good.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Philosopher Immanuel Kant justifies the use of coercion by the state by arguing that its use is necessary to secure equal freedom for all \([section 2.2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/)\). In the case of abortion, it could be argued that taking away the right of conscientious objection is necessary to ensure equal freedom to abortion for all women.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Reproductive rights, such as access to abortion, are essential for gender equality.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Access to abortion and contraception allows a woman to choose when and if she has children and thus to control her life.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Just because something gives a person more choices and more control over their own life does not mean that thing is inherently good - let alone that others should be compelled to provide it by force.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Permitting permitting a mother to kill her child would give a woman more choice and control. If she decides she regrets motherhood, she could easily opt out.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Access to reproductive rights are vital for girls and women to lead healthy lives. Poor sexual and reproductive health accounts for 1/3 of global diseases affecting women between 15 and 44 \([Planned Parenthood, p. 6](http://www.ippf.org/sites/default/files/2020_gender_equality_report_web.pdf)\).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Access to reproductive healthcare is vital for female economic empowerment \([Planned Parenthood, p. 6](http://www.ippf.org/sites/default/files/2020_gender_equality_report_web.pdf)\).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.4. Con: Abortion undermines gender equality because due to many cultures' preference for sons, access to abortion leads to the [aborting of female fetuses](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.5. Con: Abortion is not the answer to fixing gender inequality. Rather, its prevalence is a symptom of society’s failure to support women.

1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.1. Pro: College students who are pregnant find it difficult to get off-campus [housing](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/hao325/2014/04/20/college-student-pregnancy-research-saurce/). Once the child is born, housing becomes an even larger issue as they are less likely to be able to house share like many other students.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.2. Con: There are many grants and systems in place to help young mothers in education.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.2.1. Pro: The [Home Tuition Scheme](https://ie.reachout.com/inform-yourself/money-work-and-study/study/pregnancy-and-parenting-while-in-education/) provides money to the family or school of the person who is pregnant so that they can receive at home tutelage.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.2.2. Pro: The [Pregnancy Assistance Fund](https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/grant-programs/pregnancy-assistance-fund/index.html) funds states and tribunals so that they can give support to pregnant women and mothers.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.3. Pro: A US [study](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/24/pregnant-college-students-lack-univ-support/2861583/) showed that less than one in ten students with children completed their bachelor's degree within six years of college entry.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.4. Pro: A lack of higher education makes it unlikely that women will [get well-paying jobs](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2012/09/17/education-is-the-key-to-better-jobs/).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.4.1. Pro: In order to sustain low income, especially single parent families women might have to work two jobs at a time or work longer hours.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Life for these women can be extremely exhausting and this can lead to [medical issues.](http://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/1004663/how-being-overworked-affects-your-health)

1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.4.1.4. Con: Parents in low income families have access to [social welfare programs.](https://www.usa.gov/benefits) They do not need to work over time or hold multiple jobs.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.4.2. Con: A higher education is not necessary for individuals getting [high paying jobs](http://www.businessinsider.com/high-paying-jobs-you-can-get-without-a-college-degree-2015-11).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.4.2.1. Con: Many of the jobs on that list require specialized skills that a person may not have.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.4.2.2. Con: Farming requires you to own a large amount of land, which many people cannot afford, or do not have access to.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.4.2.3. Con: Many of the skills on the list require licensing before you acquire the job. Such licensing can be cost-prohibitive to obtain.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.4.2.4. Con: Many of the jobs on the list do require formal education beyond high school \(not obtained on the job\).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.4.2.5. Con: Many of the jobs on the list have low starting income \(or are based on commission\) which many people drop out of before they are able to make a liveable wage.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.4.2.6. Con: Many of these jobs require testing, which often excludes people without higher education.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3. Pro: Professor of philosophy Christopher Wellman puts forth the principle of samaritanism. He argues that coercive action by the state can be legitimized when it is for the good of society and that the individual's rights can be curtailed for the greater good \([Wellman, p. 219](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1088-4963.1996.tb00040.x/epdf)\). In the case of abortion, it could be argued that curbing doctors' right to conscientious objection would be in the interest of society.

1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.2. Pro: Abortion provides options to families and gives them more control over determining when they are ready to have a family.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.2.1. Pro: Family planning has resulted in an increase in women’s [labor-force participation.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/planned-parenthood-economic-benefits/405922/)
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.2.2. Pro: Women’s ability to [plan and space](http://Women’s ability to plan and space their pregnancies has been shown to improve educational attainment and increase wages and lifetime earnings.) their pregnancies has been shown to improve educational attainment and increase wages and lifetime earnings.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.3. Con: Abortion is an action taken by one member of a family, but it can affect all others as well. By terminating a pregnancy, you are testing a family's strength as you are potentially taking away someone's brother or someone's son.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.3.1. Pro: Decisions to have an abortion are sometimes made only by the woman who is carrying the fetus. While it is her body that has to carry the child, it is still true that her decision could go on to impact a number of people, some of whom may have wanted the child to exist.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.3.2. Con: Making lifestyle choices such as smoking or eating unhealthily which lead to shorter lifespans also impact family members by depriving them of the presence of a loved one. These are considered legitimate choices nonetheless. It is unclear why abortion should be any different.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.4. Con: Child and Family psychiatrist [Dr. Philip Ney](https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/killing-our-relatives?utm_source=LifeSiteNews.com+Daily+Newsletter&utm_campaign=da6bf524c9-LifeSiteNews_com_Canada_Headlines_06_19_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_0caba610ac-da6bf524c9-326187330) is currently exploring the effect abortion has on the other children of women who had an abortion. According to Dr Ney, these children can develop post-abortion survivor syndrome, which is a form of survivor guilt and can affect them into adulthood.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.5. Con: A quarter of people who are over the age of 35 and have an [abortion](http://www.imfcanada.org/sites/default/files/Interconnected_May2014_1.pdf) \(pp. 3\)  are currently divorced or separated as compared to only 19% of those who kept the child. By their late thirties, only 37% of those who had an abortion remain in their first marriage, compared to over 56% of people who did not have an abortion.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.5.1. Pro: Divorce impacts the couple and any children they may have negatively.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.5.1.1. Pro: Children of divorced parents are [50 percent](https://www.yourazlawfirm.com/40-facts-two-parent-families/) more likely to have health problems.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.5.2. Con: This argument confuses correlation with causation: Women being in unstable familial situations could be the reason they get abortions in the first place, rather than abortions causing families to break up.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6. Con: Women who have [abortions](http://www.imfcanada.org/sites/default/files/Interconnected_May2014_1.pdf) \(pp.3\) are twice as likely to never get married.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1. Con: Marriage is not a requirement to having a fulfilling life and a happy family.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.1. Con: Marriage provides individuals, especially parents, with useful support networks that may not exist otherwise. Having a partner eases the process of caring for a child.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.1.1. Pro: Having a partner care for a child partially or fully allows women to focus on things such as an education or their career, as women do not have to prioritize the needs of their child over their own desires and care for them all the time.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.1.2. Pro: Having a partner generally increases total household income allowing for a better quality of life.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.1.3. Pro: Having a partner gives individuals involved in a relationship access to extended family networks. Such relationships can come in handy when it comes to caring for the child and in other instances where one requires support networks.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.1.4. Con: Having a partner is not contingent on marriage, people can cohabitate.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.1.4.1. Con: Getting out of a marriage is more difficult than getting out of an informal relationship due to the stigma involved with being a divorcee and legal issues. Therefore, even though marriages may not exclusively provide partners, they provide partners that are going to comparatively stay in the relationship for a longer duration of time.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.2. Pro: A 2010 [study](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/10/psychology-single-people-more-fulfilled-relationships) claims that single people have a more fulfilling social life and experience greater psychological growth than married people.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.3. Pro: According to a Canadian [study](https://www.today.com/health/single-ladies-you-might-be-healthier-happier-married-friends-t101511), people who were single throughout their lives reported better overall health than married people.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.4. Pro: An Australian [study](https://www.today.com/health/single-ladies-you-might-be-healthier-happier-married-friends-t101511) of women in their 70s found that single women without children had the fewest diagnoses of major illnesses, the healthiest body mass index and were least likely to smoke, as compared to married women, or woman who had been married in the past.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.5. Con: According to "The Positive Effects of Marriage" by [Patrick Fagan](http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/marriage-and-family/children/children.cfm), a child in a single parent household is 14 times more likely to suffer physical abuse than a child living with married biological parents. Children who live with one parent and that parent's partner are 33 times more likely to suffer physical abuse.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.6. Con: A [study](https://www.yourazlawfirm.com/40-facts-two-parent-families/) found that children from traditional nuclear families were more likely to graduate from high school and complete college compared to those who were raised in blended or single-parent homes.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.3.6.1.7. Con: [Pew Research](https://www.yourazlawfirm.com/40-facts-two-parent-families/) shows that over half of the children living with married parents were in households with incomes at least 200% above the poverty line. At the same time, only 21% of children living in single-parent households lived in households with an income at 200% above the poverty line.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4. Con: Abortion is not a social good because it deprives society of a potential positive contributor. The state has an interest in maintaining a diverse society, and abortion disproportionately impacts certain demographics such as those with a low income.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.1. Pro: The Roe v Wade majority opinion [admitted](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#162) there is a societal interest in the life of the unborn child \(and a "compelling" interest at viability\).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.2. Con: Abortion also prevents a potential negative contributor. A fetus can turn out good or bad.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.2.1. Con: Society presumes people are good until proven otherwise.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.3. Pro: The US constitution enshrines the presumption of innocence, so unborn fetuses should be considered positive contributors until proven otherwise, which is not possible prior to birth.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.3.1. Con: Innocence however requires moral agency and independence, which is also not possible prior to birth.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.4. Con: More people does not necessarily equal a better society - on the contrary, overpopulation is a serious problem for many developing countries.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.4.1. Pro: The threat from overpopulation to the [country's resources](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151113-datapoints-china-one-child-policy/) and thus societal well-being overall became so severe in China that the government instituted a harsh One Child Policy in 1979.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.5. Con: In the US, low income families have disproportionately [more children](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/09/knocked_up_and_knocked_down.html) than high income families. Easier access to abortion could go a long way in levelling this divide in fertility rates.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.5.1. Con: The mere difference in childbirth rates between low and high income demographics does not imply that the high rates are a problem.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.5.1.1. Con: High birth rates in low income families are a [problem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781831/). It becomes more difficult to improve material conditions and gain the benefits that accrue from that.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.5.1.2. Pro: In countries without a stable social security system such as [China](https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/pramprapa/37798.htm), children are often the only source of financial support for low-income elderly.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.4. Con: What constitutes 'the good' is itself a matter of philosophical discussion. There are many different definitions of 'the good'. Therefore, the application of this policy may vary according to the ethical preferences of the state. An application of this policy may lead to a ban on abortion, for example.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.4.1. Pro: [Virtue ethicists](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/) hold that something is "good" if it contributes to human flourishing, which can be achieved by trying to perfect certain virtues and developing a sense of practical wisdom.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.4.2. Pro: [Consequentialists](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/) hold that the rightness of an action depends on whether its outcomes produce a net good. What constitutes a net good varies according to the consequentialist position one holds. For example, hedonsitic utilitarians hold that "pleasure" is the good and actions must produce more pleasure than pain to be considered right.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.4.3. Pro: Deontologists believe that whether a situation is good or bad depends on whether the action that brought it about was right or wrong.  For example, according to Immanuel Kant the only intrinsic good is a [good will](http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_deontology.html) chosen out of a feeling of moral duty. For [Divine Command Theorists](http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_deontology.html) certain acts are good and right if God ordained so, regardless of the consequences of such actions
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4. Pro: Philosopher John Rawls puts forth a theory of political liberalism, which argues that coercion is justified when it is used in accordance with a constitution that holds all citizens to the same standard \([section 3.1](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/)\). In the case of abortion, because the Supreme Court ruled it was legal, the state would be justified in using coercive action against those doctors who conscientiously object.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1. Con: The justification behind [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade), the Supreme Court ruling on which the right to abortion is based, is not in accordance with the Constitution, and so the legality of abortion in the US is questionable. Therefore, conscientious objection in the US should be seen as a fair response to a ruling that overstepped its bounds.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: The [Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) of the Constitution guarantees the right to protection and states that no person can be deprived of life without due process \([Heyman, p. 3](http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3172&context=dlj)\). If one considers a fetus a person, Roe v. Wade is thus a failure of the government to uphold its own laws.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: The Supreme Court ruling in Deshaney v. Winnebago Country Department of Social Services said that the point of the 14th Amendment is to protect people from state oppression and does not guarantee a right of protection \([Heyman, p. 3](http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3172&context=dlj)\).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: The right to protection is one of the ideas the United States was founded on. The Founding Fathers meant for the Constitution to convey the idea of a right to protection. A specific amendment was not included initially because framers did not feel it was necessary to spell it out \(subsequent events, like debates over slavery and civil rights, would change minds\) \([Heyman, p. 19-20](http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3172&context=dlj)\).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.6.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.2. Pro: [Six Supreme Court Justices](http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/ten-legal-reasons-to-reject-roe.cfm) \(Wite, Rehnquist, Scalia, Thomas, Kennedy, O'Connor\) have criticized the ruling.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.3. Pro: Roe v. Wade situates a woman's right to an abortion in the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of personal freedom, which is interpreted as the [right to privacy](http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/ten-legal-reasons-to-reject-roe.cfm). But connecting the right to privacy with the right to have an abortion is dubious.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.3.1. Con: The Supreme Court has invoked the 14th Amendment's [right to privacy for other rulings](https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14cfrag9_user.html#fnb203) related to family, and it is the logical amendment to use in regard to abortion. The modern world is confronted with many issues that could not have been anticipated in the Constitution, and so it is up to the Court to interpret it to the best of their ability.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: In [Griswold v. Connecticut](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/381/479) \(1965\), the Supreme Court used the 14th Amendment to overturn the ban on distributing contraception and information on its use.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: In [Loving v. Virginia](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/388/1) \(1967\), the Supreme Court struck down the ban on interracial marriage using the 14th Amendment.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.3.1.3. Pro: In [Eisenstadt v. Baird](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/405/438/) \(1972\), the Supreme Court ruled that unmarried people should have the same right to contraception as married people, citing the 14th Amendment.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.4. Con: This does not change the legal status of abortion unless Roe v Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court itself.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.5. Con: Only taking the U.S. Constitution [literally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_letter_law) would result in unfair laws, without any consideration of morals. Part of the duty of the Supreme Court of America is to interpret laws in a way that prevents unjust laws from continuing and to watch over the laws made by the states. Without this protection and discretion, the Supreme Court would be ineffectual in acting as a check on legislative power.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.5.1. Con: The role of the justices of the Supreme Court is to uphold the Constitution. To engage in [judicial activism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_activism) is contrary to role prescribed to judges in the Constitution.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.5.1.1. Con: If a case has been brought before the Supreme Court [the justices' role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States), [as defined by the constitution](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/constitutional.aspx), is to decide one way or the other. If issuing rulings that clarify legal ambiguities is 'judicial activism'  then that is the kind of activism that the Court was originally created for.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.6.1.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.3. Pro: The state has a duty to protect the health and lives of its citizens, so it has a right to ban actions that undermine this purpose.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.12.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.3.3. Con: A ban on conscientious objection is in reality not a ban on actions, but rather actively forcing individuals to participate in a system they have a moral objection to.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.4. Pro: There are countless examples of laws regulating and restricting citizens' behaviour, spanning everything from traffic regulation to penalties imposed on murder.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: Nozick's libertarian theory of the minimal state posits that the state can only legitimately intervene in people's lives in order to protect citizens from [force, fraud, and theft](http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/#SH2a).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.3. Con: Medical ethics are necessarily a matter of personal belief \(ethics cannot be demonstrably proven\). No one would argue that medical ethics should not be brought into the profession. Therefore, personal beliefs must be incorporated into the medical profession.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Ethics are [subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_subjectivism).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.1.4.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.3.3. Pro: The medical profession is constructed on personal beliefs. An example would be the personal beliefs held in the Hippocratic Oath, such as, "There is an art to medicine." These personal beliefs deserve consideration because they have contributed to our ethical progress in medicine.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.4. Con: The issue is medical because doctors are the ones qualified to perform an abortion. The overwhelming majority of abortions are not performed for health related reasons; therefore, personal belief is central in this particular debate
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.12.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.5. Con: Doctor's personal beliefs are not less important than those of a patient. "I should have an abortion because \(array of reasons\)" is a personal belief in circumstances where womans health is not in danger.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.6. Con: Personal beliefs make us human, you can't get them out of the argument.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.8. Pro: The only principle that refusal of treatment should be based on is that of "[do no harm](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2213560X14000034/1-s2.0-S2213560X14000034-main.pdf?_tid=d05ad66c-9b12-11e7-9c4f-00000aab0f6b&acdnat=1505589256_08b26e90118024e146c596314b269fc1)." For example, refusal might be justified if the patient requests risky experimental treatment.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.8.1. Con: Those who oppose abortion consider it a harmful operation.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.4.1.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.3.1.1.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9. Pro: Introducing religion into medicine undermines a practice that depends on scientific evidence and medical ethics.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.1. Con: The term "belief", when used correctly does not simply refer to "religious tenants one holds". Rather, a "belief" is any information that an individual holds within their mind as something that reflects reality and thereby lives according to. Therefore, all medical professionals, whether "religious" or "irreligious" necessarily bring beliefs into their practice. To legislate against any belief system, even if religious, is discriminatory.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.1.1. Con: There is plenty of legislation, such as [hate crime laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime_laws_in_the_United_States), that is in opposition to belief by this definition, that is neither unjust or prejudicial \(discriminatory\) in its treatment of different categories of people or thing.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.1.2. Con: While there are many belief systems not all of them are conducive to healthy medical services. As such it is important to regulate against those beliefs. For example, a medical practitioner who believes profit matters more then safety may use the same needle more than once on multiple people to save costs.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.2. Pro: Faith-based medicine cannot be reconciled with evidence-based medicine because if the former exists, faith wins by default because it cannot rationally be argued against.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.2.1. Con: The distinction between faith-based medicine and evidence-based medicine is not relevant here. Whether or not conscientious objection to abortions should be allowed is a problem of morality, definitions and limits of religious freedom, and the implementation of ethics in law.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.2.1.1. Con: Questions of morality, religious freedom, and legal ethics should be at least partly rooted in evidence. If one believes that the answers to these questions will, in fact, change the world in a certain manner then evidence provides a way of falsifying that belief.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.2.1.1.1. Pro: If, for example, a Doctor believes that abstinence based education is morally good because it avoids unwanted pregnancies, they should revise their belief in the morality of abstinence based education if it turns out it is not the best way to avoid unwanted pregnancies.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.3. Con: Conscientious objection does not introduce religion into medicine, because nobody questions the science behind the procedure, ignores evidence or tries to prevent the procedure from happening. It is merely a personal choice not to take part in a procedure one finds morally reprehensible.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.3.1. Con: Doctors have a large amount of influence over their patients. It is seen in other medical procedures that [doctors'](http://healthland.time.com/2013/05/10/doctors-word-choice-impact-whether-patients-families-choose-cpr/) personal opinions and how they phrase the information they provide can influence a patient's decision. Due to this, their refusal to perform a procedure could influence vulnerable women seeking an abortion.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.3.1.1. Con: It is implicit that abortions are good and should be encouraged since only doctors that may hint against-rather than for-abortion are penalized. If a young woman came to a doctor unsure about what to do and the doctors phraseology implied an abortion would be best then there is no difference between the situations except the outcome.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.3.1.1.1. Con: The difference in that situation would be that a woman who is not interested in an abortion would have no reason to schedule an appointment with a doctor to discuss a pregnancy ending procedure. Through arranging the appointment the woman has already implied that she is interested in the procedure, if still partially unsure.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.11. Con: It is unclear when life begins even in scientific terms so room for personal belief must be permitted.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12. Pro: Personal beliefs should not be able to override women's legal right to access abortions.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2. Pro: Once women have a legal right to access abortions, this creates a duty for the state to defend that right and ensure that women all across the country have this right in practice, not only in theory.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.1. Pro: Humans' right to life creates both positive and negative obligations the state: It needs to both refrain from taking lives and actively try to [prevent the loss of life](http://www.ijrcenter.org/thematic-research-guides/right-to-life/).
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.2. Pro: The human right to education does not merely mean that people cannot be punished for getting an education. On the contrary, it is understood to [confer on the state](https://en.unesco.org/themes/right-to-education/state-obligations) the principal responsibility for the provision of this right.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.2.1. Con: But this does not mean that the state can conscript people to become teachers, or that government employees who don't want to teach kids should be forced to do so.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.3. Pro: For the respective legal right to exist, every single woman needs to be able to access abortions. If only one woman is denied this right for any reason, the state has been derelict in its duty of implementing its citizens legal rights, which need to apply indiscriminately at all times.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.3.1. Pro: If there are exceptions to the right to life or education for certain citizens of a state, it cannot be said that citizens of that state actually have the right to life or education.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.7.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.5. Con: On the converse, states have also given doctors the right to practice their religion. If the logical framework of this claim is to be followed then the state has the duty to defend this right and ensure all doctors can exercise it in reality.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.5.1. Con: Something being a religious value does not mean that it cannot be limited by the state – killing due to one's religious beliefs is clearly unacceptable. If conscientious objection creates danger to people's lives or health, it, too, should be limited.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.3. Con: Women have a legal right to have an abortion, they do not have a legal right to demand a particular doctor perform said abortion. As long as they have access to it, the right is intact. The law does not force Doctors to perform the procedure though and it cannot legally force them to either.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.3.1. Con: If no doctors in her area are willing to perform the procedure, she does not have access to it.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.4. Pro: Allowing conscientious objection has the potential of nullifying existing laws that give women the right to have an abortion.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.5. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.6. Pro: A Doctor's right to their own beliefs should not be more important than the patient receiving legal health care. The Doctor has chosen to enter this profession, while patients may not always be in this position due to their own actions and choices. This can be seen in pregnancies caused by rape and incest.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.13. Con: Sometimes bringing personal beliefs into medicine is necessary to prevent moral boundaries from being crossed.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.13.1. Pro: Doctors should be able to object if they feel the mother \(or anyone for that matter\) is being coerced into abortions \(and any other procedures\) against their will. This subject becomes more complicated based on the mental capacity of the patient but nobody loses their rights just for existing differently.
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.13.2. Pro: In the same way that in some countries members of the army have a right not to abide by an order they believe to be unethical, nobody should be forced to do something on subjects related to murder and crime against humanity \(which pro-life associate abortion with\)
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.13.3. Pro: As the "Death with Dignity" movement grows, allowing doctors to euthanize or participate in the euthanizing of terminally ill patients, this practice will inevitably violate the conscience of many medical professionals. This is why many do not participate in it, despite the amount of pain a patient may be in. Overruling their personal beliefs about life and death would be overstepping a moral boundary
1.3.10.3.1.4.1.13.4. Pro: Ethics and medicine cannot be separated since some medical procedures may be possible, but unethical. Personal beliefs are central to determining where the line between ethical and unethical medical practice lies.
1.3.10.3.1.4.2. Con: Saving lives is a fundamental part of medical professionals' ethics. If they personally believe that life starts at conception, asking them to perform an abortion would be the same as asking them to kill and violate that fundamental part of their professional ethics.
1.3.10.3.1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.8.
1.3.10.3.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.4.

1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.
1.5. Pro: Laws permitting conscientious objection are discriminatory in favour of Christianity and against other religions.
1.5.1. Con: [Most religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_abortion) have stipulations which do not allow frivolous abortions.
1.5.1.1. Con: These stipulations are diverse and often worded unclearly, which leaves it ultimately up to the believers of these religions to interpret them.
1.5.2. Con: Laws permitting conscientious objection allow people of all world views to object, regardless of whether they are adhering to Christian beliefs or any other religious doctrine. This is by definition not discriminatory.
1.5.2.1. Con: Absolute opposition to abortion is a phenomenon primarily associated with [Christianity](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/21/where-major-religious-groups-stand-on-abortion/).
1.5.2.1.1. Con: There are branches of Christianity that do not oppose abortion.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Many members of Christian faiths believe that people should be able to access abortions.
1.5.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: In a recent [Pew Research Center survey](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/03/about-seven-in-ten-americans-oppose-overturning-roe-v-wade/), 63% of Protestants, 49% of white Evangelicals, and 61% of Catholics believe that the Supreme Court ruling [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade) should not be overturned.
1.5.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Individual beliefs surrounding abortion are irrelevant. Individuals may choose to ignore aspects of Christian doctrine, that does not take away from the fact that it is Christian doctrine.
1.5.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Individual beliefs might be irrelevant in determining religious doctrine, but they are relevant when making legislation. If the Christian doctrine prescribes something, but a significant number of Christians do not agree, what they are "supposed" to believe is irrelevant. This is the difference between a democracy and a theocracy.
1.5.2.1.1.2. Pro: The [United Methodist Church](http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/the-united-methodist-church-and-the-complex-topic-of-abortion) believes there are circumstances, such as when the mother is in danger, that justify an abortion.
1.5.2.1.1.3. Pro: The [Evangelical Lutheran Church of America](http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/AbortionSS.pdf) believes abortion should be "an option only of last resort."
1.5.2.1.1.4. Pro: The [Church of England](https://www.churchofengland.org/our-views/medical-ethics-health-social-care-policy/abortion.aspx) is opposed to abortion but recognizes there are certain situations when it is necessary.
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: There is no record of significant numbers of atheist, Jewish or Muslim doctors conscientiously objecting to performing an abortion. While in theory non-discriminatory, this law practically only serves Christian doctors.
1.5.2.1.3. Con: If allowing conscientious objection is otherwise the most ethical policy, it doesn't make any difference whether or not most conscientious objectors would be Christian or any other specific religion.
1.5.2.1.4. Con: Absolute oposition is not the only reason to opose. So it doesn't matter if a doctor wants to object in a particular case or in any case.
1.5.2.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.5.
1.5.2.1.6. Pro: Most [Muslims](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml) regard abortion as wrong, but Islam accepts it in certain cases.
1.5.2.1.6.1. Pro: There is no record of Muslim doctors conscientiously objecting to performing abortions.
1.5.2.1.6.2. Pro: There is the principle in [Islamic](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml) law of chosing the lesser of two evils. In cases where the mother's life is in danger, abortion is seen as the lesser of two evils because the woman already has a family and responsibilities, and in many cases the death of the mother would mean the death of the fetus.
1.5.2.1.6.3. Pro: Many [Islamic scholars](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml) agree that abortion should be allowed in cases where the fetus suffers from an untreatable defect that would prevent the child from living a normal life.
1.5.2.1.6.4. Pro: In Iran, the Ayatollahs have issued fatwas permitting abortion under certain circumstances. [Grand Ayatollah Yusuf Saanei wrote](http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/29/news/mn-5913), "Islam is also a religion of compassion, and if there are serious problems, God sometimes doesn't require his creatures to practice his laws. So, under some conditions - such as parents' poverty or overpopulation - then abortion is allowed."
1.5.2.1.6.5. Pro: The Quran never specifically mentions abortion but does differentiate between a fetus and a human, thus suggesting that the highest form of Islamic religious authority does not consider a fetus to have all the rights of personhood and that abortion is permissible \([Shapiro, p. 485](https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/29/4/483/653159/Abortion-law-in-Muslim-majority-countries-an)\).
1.5.2.1.6.5.1. Con: Under Islamic jurisprudence, the fetus doesn't have all the rights of a person but its right to life is only disregarded if there is a danger to the mother's health. The reasoning is that since the mother is a full person, she already has relations and duties in the world, for example, her family or work and that the fetus is not absolutely comparable. It is important to note this distinction cannot be used as a blanket justification for abortion under any condition.
1.5.2.1.6.5.1.1. Con: It is assumed that there exists such a thing as "unified Islamic jurisprudence". In reality, there are [different schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhhab) of Islamic jurisprudence, and thereby different verdicts on the matter of abortion.
1.5.2.1.6.5.1.1.1. Pro: The [Hanafi school](http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/Forum/abortion/background/islam1.html) is flexible on abortion. It specifies that before the fourth month of pregnancy, an abortion may be induced if a woman's pregnancy poses a threat to the life of her already existing infant.
1.5.2.1.6.5.1.1.2. Pro: The [Maliki position](http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/Forum/abortion/background/islam1.html) prohibits an abortion after implantation has taken place, while the Shafi'i school maintains that at any stage after fertilization the zygote should not be disturbed, and interference with its development would be a sin.
1.5.2.1.6.5.1.1.3. Pro: The [Hanbali school](http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/Forum/abortion/background/islam1.html) by stipulating the payment of blood wit for causing a miscarriage shows that it regards abortion as a sin.
1.5.2.1.6.5.1.1.4. Con: All schools of Islamic jurisprudence regard abortion as wrong and forbidden after [ensoulment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensoulment), unless the continuation of pregnancy endangers the life of the mother or introduces intolerable difficulties in her life. [\(Aramesh, pg1\)](http://jmehm.tums.ac.ir/index.php/jmehm/article/viewFile/7/7)
1.5.2.1.6.5.1.1.5. Pro: [Shi'ite schools](http://jmehm.tums.ac.ir/index.php/jmehm/article/viewFile/7/7) allow for abortion before 4 months of pregnancy. They allow for it if the mother's life is in danger or will be made extremely difficult due to the birth of the child. They have also allowed for abortion in the case of rape.
1.5.2.1.6.5.1.1.6. Con: There is no denying a plurality of madhab \(schools of thought\) in both Shia and Sunni branches of Islam. There also exists differences of opinion between scholars of the same school. However the [majority view](https://yaqeeninstitute.org/en/omar-suleiman/islam-and-the-abortion-debate/) today in terms of sheer numbers among practitioners of the faith, for both Sunni and Shia, is the aforementioned view of abortion as permissible only when there is an imminent risk to the mother's health. It is therefore prudent to act as though this view represents Islam as a whole.
1.5.2.1.6.5.1.2. Con: In [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Iran), abortion is legal in cases where the mother's life is in danger, and in cases of fetal abnormalities that make the fetus nonviable after birth or produce difficulties for the mother to take care of it after birth, such as major thalassemia or bilateral polycystic kidney disease.
1.5.2.1.6.6. Pro: All Muslim countries allow abortion if the woman's life is in danger \([Shapiro, p. 489](https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/29/4/483/653159/Abortion-law-in-Muslim-majority-countries-an)\).
1.5.2.1.7. Pro: [Judaism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/abortion_1.shtml) does not forbid abortion but only allows it for serious reasons.
1.5.2.1.7.1. Pro: If the mother's life is in danger, [Judaism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/abortion_1.shtml) insists the fetus must be aborted because the mother's life is viewed as more important than that of the fetus.
1.5.2.1.8. Pro: [Hinduism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml) is opposed to abortion except when necessary to save the mother's life.
1.5.2.1.9. Con: While associated with Christianity most strongly, it is not exclusive to Christianity. To limit the discussion to that context ignores many of the [secular](http://www.secularprolife.org/) and legal rationales to the argument.
1.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.2.
1.5.3. Con: Allowing members of a particular religion to freely engage in their beliefs is not discriminatory simply because other religions do not share those beliefs.
1.5.4. Pro: Given the close link between Christianity and conscientious objection, legalising it is akin to conferring special rights upon Christian citizens and granting them privileged treatment that no other citizens receive. This is discrimination.
1.5.4.1. Con: Recognizing the right not to kill someone that a doctor sincerely believes is a human being is not "privileged treatment" based on religious belief. It follows naturally from the universal belief among ordered societies that murder is wrong.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: This would only follow naturally from the universal belief that murder is wrong if everyone agreed that abortion is murder, which is not the case. Otherwise, anyone could claim that they consider something murder and refuse to do it.
1.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.2.
1.5.4.3. Con: Objection to abortion is not necessarily associated with Christianity. [Several atheists](http://www.secularprolife.org/) feel that abortion kills a living human being and that said killing is immoral.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.5.6. Pro: In Western countries, similar exceptions aimed at catering towards specific religious beliefs would never be created for other religions, such as Islam. On the contrary, those laws would be violently opposed by large parts of the population.
1.5.6.1. Con: A failure of government to protect a certain group does not grant it the right to do so to another.
1.5.6.2. Con: Native American religious beliefs are, in fact, [specifically protected](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1996) by U.S. law. For example, certain drugs that are otherwise illegal are legal in the context of religious ceremonies.
1.5.6.3. Con: The United Kingdom has already allowed the establishment of [Beth Din and Sharia](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7233040.stm) courts to take care of civil disputes.
1.5.6.4. Pro: The alleged [special treatment](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/06/19/is-aclu-giving-muslims-special-treatment.html) of Muslims and alleged exceptions in the legal system created for [Shariah law](https://www.wnyc.org/story/counter-jihad-movement-making-president) have been one of the main points of contention from the right in most Western countries in recent years.
1.5.6.5. Pro: While the debates around conscientious objection show that the public is willing to cater to Christian doctors even at the expense of a patient's health, even the most basic religiously motivated healthcare needs of Muslims are often [neither understood](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3358400/) nor catered to.
1.5.6.6. Con: In the [U.S.](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1019.7582&rep=rep1&type=pdf), Muslim medical students are known to conscientiously object to performing examinations on the opposite gender.
1.5.6.7. Pro: Muslim medical students allegedly refusing to attend lectures on certain medical procedures or to see patients of the opposite sex caused an [uproar](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1178411/Muslim-dentist-refused-treat-female-patients-unless-wore-Islamic-dress.html) [in the](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-486213/Muslim-medical-students-refuse-learn-alcohol-sexual-diseases.html) [United Kingdom](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/3643194/If-Muslim-doctors-are-intolerant-let-them-go.html).
1.5.7. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.
1.5.8. Con: Laws not permitting conscientious objection would be discriminatory against Christianity and other religions. Someone will be discriminated against so this is a non-factor.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Banning conscientious objection would violate medical staff's freedom of religion.
1.5.8.1.1. Con: Society only protects individual rights as long as the exercise of those rights do not cause harm to others. Conscientious objection endangers the health and lives of women, so it is not covered by the freedom of religion.
1.5.8.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.7.
1.5.8.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.15.
1.5.8.1.1.3. Pro: Religious freedom is not the freedom to discriminate.
1.5.8.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.1.
1.5.8.1.1.3.2. Pro: Allowing conscientious objection can create a dangerous standard for how care is administered in other situations relating to reproductive rights. It implies that discrimination is acceptable as long as it can be justified with reference to faith.
1.5.8.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Allowing conscientious objection in regard to abortion suggests it is alright for anti-choice pharmacists to refuse prescriptions for birth control or emergency contraception \([Fiala & Arthur, p. 15](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2213560X14000034/1-s2.0-S2213560X14000034-main.pdf?_tid=c25adae8-9b18-11e7-96eb-00000aab0f27&acdnat=1505591810_a1fea1adda709beb14a92585d09069dc)\).
1.5.8.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Allowing conscientious objection would suggest it is acceptable for conservative health care providers [to refuse women other medical services](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19190916/ns/health-womens_health/t/doctors-beliefs-can-hinder-patient-care/). Planned Parenthood reports that fertility clinics have turned away lesbians and unmarried women and doctors have refused to perform sterilizations.
1.5.8.1.1.3.2.3. Con: Given that the right to conscientious objection is already [under siege](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sweden-blacklists-an-antiabortion-midwife-1491768904), it is unlikely that analogous and more extreme exceptions will be created .
1.5.8.1.1.3.2.4. Pro: Actions such as allowing conscientious objection provide a legal basis for others to claim a right to refuse care or service to someone for being gay, on the basis of their religion.
1.5.8.1.1.3.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.8.
1.5.8.1.1.3.2.5. Pro: Allowing conscientious objection in regard to abortion suggests it is alright for hospitals to discriminate against [transgender individuals](https://www.aclu.org/cases/franciscan-alliance-v-burwell) seeking gender-confirming care.
1.5.8.1.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.8.
1.5.8.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.5.8.1.2. Pro: [Article 18](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion".
1.5.8.1.2.1. Con: In the U.S., refusing to marry same sex couples is viewed as [discrimination](http://www.thedailybeast.com/refusing-to-marry-same-sex-couples-isnt-religious-freedom-its-just-discrimination) rather than religious freedom. Consequently, refusing to perform an abortion should not be freedom of religion either, but a prevention of autonomy.
1.5.8.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.8.1.1.
1.5.8.1.2.3. Con: Soldiers in the army are taught to work in line with orders and [not their opinions](https://www.cram.com/essay/Why-Following-Orders-In-The-Army/P3DQ4T3XJ). This helps them work more efficiently and without hesitation as they are conditioned so that they have utter trust in their superiors and fellow soldiers.
1.5.8.1.2.3.1. Con: Denying freedom of religious expression is not analogous to a soldier following orders. In an army, diverging beliefs and opinions are often harmful to the mission. Democratic society as a whole, however, is not harmed by differing opinions.
1.5.8.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Democratic society can be harmed by views and opinions that are anti-democratic.
1.5.8.1.2.3.1.2. Con: In a medical situation beliefs which are not based in fact and science could be harmful. Therefore differing beliefs and opinions which are not supported by medicine should not be allowed in a medical profession.
1.5.8.1.3. Pro: Forcing people to perform abortions leads to discrimination as most religious doctors could not do it .
1.5.8.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.5.8.1.4. Con: A person can object to abortion without it having anything to do with religion.
1.5.8.1.5. Pro: Current Title VII law in the U.S. prohibits discrimination in all aspects of employment with respect to job applicants and employees because of their religious beliefs and practices or lack thereof. This includes protecting “[moral or ethical beliefs](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/foia/letters/2008/titlevii_religious_hhsprovider_reg.html) as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views."
1.5.8.1.6. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.9.
1.5.8.1.7. Pro: The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the freedom of religion and says that Congress can make no law prohibiting the "[free exercise](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment)" of one's religion. Conscientious objection is just that.
1.5.8.1.7.1. Con: Religious freedom is never unlimited.
1.5.8.1.7.1.1. Pro: According to Article 18 of the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx), freedom to manifest one's religious belief may be limited if necessary to protect "public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others".
1.5.8.1.7.1.2. Pro: Freedom of religion can be limited in the US if there is a [compelling government interest](http://harvardpolitics.com/covers/limits-of-religious-freedom/) involved.
1.5.8.1.8. Pro: To say that medical professionals must be complicit with a procedure that may be morally unacceptable according to their religious values is to say their religious values are unacceptable in society. Because of the clear polarity of this, abortion aught be considered a specialist practice.
1.5.8.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.5.1.
1.5.8.1.9. Pro: Banning conscientious objection would discriminate against people with religious beliefs that consider abortion unethical and effectively bar them from entering the medical profession.
1.5.8.1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.5.
1.5.8.1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.7.5.1.
1.5.8.1.10. Pro: There are a high number of medical professionals with religious beliefs who entered the medical profession assuming they would not have to perform abortions. Changing the law would force them to leave their jobs.
1.5.8.1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.5.1.
1.5.8.1.10.2. Con: In the U.S., even with a conscientious objection ban, these medical professionals would still not be [qualified](http://www.ru486.com/topics/articles/index.php?id=89) to perform an abortion because it requires extra training and education, a choice still left to the medical professional.
1.5.8.1.10.2.1. Pro: It is likely that many medical professionals who are against abortion would not, in the first place, opt in for this extra training and education. This reduces the chances that they will have to object citing conscientious reasons.
1.5.8.1.11. Con: Under US law, freedom of religion can be limited when there is a [compelling government interest](http://harvardpolitics.com/covers/limits-of-religious-freedom/) involved. Abortion is a social good and a legal right under current law, making its provision a compelling state interest that justifies limiting freedom of religion.
1.5.8.1.11.1. Con: Consider that the same body of law considers sincere conscientious objection [reasonable grounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objection_in_the_United_States) to refuse to serve in the military during wartime. It's hard to argue that the convenience of an individual abortion is a more compelling government interest than national defense.
1.5.8.1.11.1.1. Con: A single conscientious objection to military service does not endanger national security, but one woman not being able to access an abortion means that her legal right to an abortion has been taken away. Hence, the two situations are not analogous.
1.5.8.1.11.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.5.8.1.11.2. Con: Abortion being legal only means that the state will not punish women who have an abortion, or medical personnel who perform abortions. This does not imply that the government has an interest in abortions being performed, or that this alleged interest is compelling enough to coerce people into performing abortions.
1.5.8.1.11.2.1. Pro: The Roe v Wade majority opinion claimed a societal interest in the life of the mother and even the life of the baby. It weighs these interests against each other and the rights of the woman. It makes no claim to a societal interest in abortions actually happening, only in the rights of women to have them.[Majority opinion in Roe v Wade ::163](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#163)
1.5.8.1.11.2.2. Con: Roe v. Wade states that women have a right to an abortion, not a right to not be punished when they get an abortion. It also creates a duty for the state to defend that right and ensure that women all across the US have this right in practice, not only in theory.
1.5.8.1.11.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.1.
1.5.8.1.11.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.2.2.
1.5.8.1.11.2.2.3. Con: The right to an abortion is a negative right derived from the right to privacy, i.e. it is the right to obtain an abortion without the interference of the State by making it [illegal or essentially impossible.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/492/490) It is not a positive right such as the right to an attorney while being questioned by police, the right to a trial by jury if being tried for a crime. No duty on the part of the state exists to ensure that women have access to abortion services by compelling doctors against their will.
1.5.8.1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.2.1.
1.5.8.1.11.4. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.2.2.1.
1.5.8.1.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.
1.5.8.1.11.6. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.3.3.4.
1.5.9. Con: [70% of the United States](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/) is Christian, and so it makes sense the laws would reflect those beliefs.
1.5.9.1. Con: The US constitution recognises the importance of the [separation of church and state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state_in_the_United_States), which means that laws should not be based around any particular religion, even if a large number of people hold Christian views.
1.5.9.2. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.1.
1.5.9.3. Con: The purpose of Law is not to benefit the majority.
1.5.9.4. Pro: It is natural that laws reflect religious principles, because laws are [based on morals](https://www2.gwu.edu/~ccps/rcq/legislating_morality.html) and morals are often rooted in religion.
1.5.9.4.1. Con: The fact that laws often reflect the values \(even when rooted in religion\) of the majority, does not mean we should uncritically accept religious principles as law. Instead they should be discussed, evaluated and tested against reality like any other value, and discarded if they don't hold up.
1.5.9.4.2. Con: Morality can exist without religious beliefs.
1.5.9.4.2.1. Pro: There are many evolutionary [theories](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-humans-became-moral-beings-80976434/) backing this up showing that altruism in early hunter gatherers was the earliest form of morality, far before religion had an influence.
1.5.9.4.2.1.1. Con: However, there is a difference between behavioral altruism and moral altruism. Sentient creatures understand and create moral standards, while nonsentient creatures behave altruistically without thinking about it. Humans develop standards when they develop the capacity to remember and familiarize with a beneficial action. It becomes moral when the action is standardized as good \(moral +\) or bad \(moral -\).
1.5.10. Con: It would not be discriminating in favour of one faith to allow acting on conscience because everyone's conscience is shaped by their worldview which has elements of faith in it \(even atheists and secular humanists\).
1.5.10.1. Con: Although not discriminating solely in favour of one faith, it does discriminate in favour of the largest organised religion in the world, [Christianity](http://www.worldstopmost.com/2017-2018-2019-2020/news/largest-religions-world-top-10-fastest-growing-list/).
1.5.11. Con: Conscientious objection is equatable to objection to participate in murder and therefore is a civic, not religious, law.
1.5.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.5.11.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.5.8.1.
1.8. Con: The state cannot legitimately force doctors to perform an abortion.
1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.1.
1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.2.
1.8.5. Pro: A doctor performs a service for a fee and the oath they take does not include an obligation to heal everyone. They have no obligation \(nor should they\) to service anyone who seeks a claim on them.
1.8.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.15.1.1.
1.8.5.2. Pro: As no one finds it reasonable to oblige a baker to make a specific kind of bread, nor it seems acceptable for a prostitute be obliged to fulfill a specific fetish, it doesn't make sense for only physicians to have their freedom of choice restricted.
1.8.6. Pro: Using the [Superior Orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders) defense is often not enough to exonerate a person of immoral behavior. As such an individual's own morality should be used to dictate their actions.
1.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.
1.8.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.
1.8.9. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.3.
1.8.10. Pro: Laws requiring doctors to tell patients about abortions violates their First Amendment rights, which includes freedom from speech, and therefore the government cannot force doctors to give patients such information.
1.8.10.1. Con: Doctors may be constitutionally entitled to free speech, but knowingly withholding treatment from a patient is a serious breach of their professional ethics such that punishment is justified.
1.8.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.15.1.
1.8.10.1.2. Pro: A doctor should be required to inform the patient of the existence of recognized alternative treatments, even if they wouldn't want to provide such treatments themselves. A doctor who thinks mental illness shouldn't be treated with drugs should still provide drug info \(at least pamphlets\) to the patient. A doctor who thinks cancer can be solved through diet should still provide info on chemo. A doctor who lets their personal beliefs interfere with the patient's informed consent is unethical.
1.8.10.2. Pro: In 2016 Illinois passed a law that mandated that healthcare providers still had to provide information about abortion, even if they conscientiously objected from performing the procedure. Recently, [a federal court overturned the law](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-abortion-speech-scotus-0814-md-20170811-story.html), saying it harmed freedom of speech.
1.8.10.3. Pro: The First Amendment protects freedom from speech in addition to freedom of speech, and that principle has been upheld by the Supreme Court.
1.8.10.3.1. Pro: In the case of [West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/319/624) \(1943\) the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protects students from being forced to say the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools.
1.8.10.3.2. Pro: In the case of [Wooley v. Maynard](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/430/705) \(1977\), the Supreme Court ruled that New Hampshire could not constitutionally require its citizens to display the state motto, "Live Free or Die," on their license plates.
1.8.10.3.3. Pro: In the case of [Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, & Bisexual Group of Boston](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-749.ZO.html) \(1995\), the Supreme Court ruled that private organizations could exclude groups whose message they disagreed with.
1.8.11. Pro: Doctors who perform abortions are at [an increased risk](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/29/being-a-doctor-who-performs-abortions-means-you-always-fear-your-life-is-in-danger/?utm_term=.7eed13493f17) of being attacked or harassed online or in person. Conscientious objection can be used as a means of protection against possible security risks and is therefore legitimate.
1.8.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.8.11.2. Con: This is an issue with anti-abortion extremists rather than conscientious objection itself. The answer is not to encourage doctors to avoid abortions, but to tackle the threat they are exposed to.
1.8.11.2.1. Con: Not all states have apparatuses that can effectively protect people from the threat of violence. In circumstances where people feel unsafe and law enforcement is ineffective, it is justified to use conscientious objection as a means of protection.
1.8.11.3. Pro: [34.2%](http://msmagazine.com/blog/2017/02/09/newsflash-rates-severe-violence-targeting-abortion-providers-patients-clinics-20-year-high/) of abortion providers in the U.S. have reported serious actions against them by anti-abortion advocates such as stalking and death threats.
1.8.11.4. Con: Conscientious objection causes a clear divide between doctors who object to abortion and those who do not. It forces doctors to pick a side in the abortion debate and thus makes them targets. If conscientious objection did not exist, doctors would not personally be held responsible for abortions.
1.8.11.4.1. Con: Solidarity and united fronts are beneficial, but should not come at the cost of being forced to do something you believe to be fundamentally immoral and/or an insult to God.
1.8.11.4.2. Pro: Doctors on either side are discriminated against due to the choice in regards to conscientious objection. In the [UK](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/uk-doctors-nurses-feel-pressured-to-participate-in-abortions) doctors who are conscientious objectors often are treated with hostility by their colleagues, passed over for promotions and miss out on job opportunities.
1.8.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.5.10.
1.9. Pro: Legalizing conscientious objection undermines the rule of law.
1.9.1. Con: The rule of law is the [principle](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rule%20of%20law) that laws of a country are obeyed by everyone. If conscientious objection is legalized, then those who object are abiding by the law. Thus, legalizing conscientious objection bolsters the rule of law by allowing doctors who refuse to perform abortions to stay within the boundaries of the law.
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.2.1.2.4.1.
1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.5.8.1.
1.9.4. Pro: Conscientious objection allows doctors to [boycott](http://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115\(17\)30357-3/fulltext?cc=y=) certain laws. This would not be acceptable in other careers.
1.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.9.4.2. Con: The debate is whether the law should or should not force people to perform abortion, so what the law is or is not currently is not justification for what it should be. That said, most laws ask people to refrain from action rather than forcing an action - most famously in the case of someone drowning you must not drown them but have no legal obligation to save them.
1.9.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.2.1.
1.9.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.8.1.2.1.
1.9.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.
1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.8.1.1.3.2.
1.9.6. Con: In the Supreme Court Case [Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/13-354) the Court ruled that companies can invoke religious freedom as justification for not paying contraception-related health insurance, even though the Affordable Care Act mandated that they do so. This suggests that allowing conscientious objection is in line with the rule of law and does not undermine it.
1.9.6.1. Con: Refusing to pay for a treatment as a company and refusing to provide treatment as a responsible doctor are intrinsically different actions.
1.9.6.1.1. Pro: A company's function is to generate profit and to provide employees with salaries. A doctor's task is to help patients. Therefore, it is easier to decline the provision for companies, as doctors have this intrinsic duty, which actually defines their job.
1.9.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.15.1.
1.9.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.1.4.1.12.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.11. Con: Performing abortions is only one element of medicine. People should be able to choose to specialise without being forced to perform this particular procedure.
1.11.1. Con: People have a right to become a doctor with everything that entails. However, this right does not include a right to make demands regarding which parts of the profession people are willing to exercise.
1.11.1.1. Pro: Especially in health care, it is imperative for everyone involved to do their job to the fullest of their ability. If they do not, it is impossible to ensure that the health care system as a whole provides the best care possible and key services might be unavailable.
1.11.1.1.1. Pro: If conscientious objection is legal, it needs to be legal for every single medical professional. However, once a critical amount of doctors refuse to perform abortions, it will become impossible for many women to access a doctor willing to perform the procedure.
1.11.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.11.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.6.
1.11.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.
1.11.1.3. Con: It is wrong to lock people out of particular fields because of particular beliefs they hold. Many people may be able to provide excellent and useful skills to the medical profession but not want to perform abortions.
1.11.1.3.1. Pro: When a person wants to help protect our country, but is unwilling to take a life, they can still serve as a medic on the battlefield -- or help out with the supplies and paperwork necessary to keep the operation running smoothly.  Banning people from an entire field of work because they don't want to do some part of it seems short-sighted at best.
1.11.2. Con: Ethnic minorities and women are still [underrepresented](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-healthcare-diversity/women-minorities-still-underrepresented-in-medical-specialties-idUSKCN0QT23I20150824) in the medical profession, yet there are no special provisions to accommodate them. It is unclear why conscientious objectors can claim a right to special treatment if these underrepresented groups cannot.
1.11.2.1. Con: This conflates two unrelated issues. It is unclear why underrepresented ethnic minorities and women are analogous to conscientious objectors. These situations are not directly linked.
1.11.2.2. Con: Just because under-represented minorities do not get access to special treatment does not lead to the conclusion that conscientious objectors should not either. Rather, one should conclude that minorities deserve special protection just as conscientious objectors do.
1.11.2.3. Pro: The long and inflexible work hours in the medical profession pose a substantial structural barrier for the participation of women in the medical field [across the world](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4235590/). However, there have been no meaningful attempts at catering directly for their special needs.
1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.3.
1.11.4. Con: Only the field of obstetrics and gynaecology requires practice of abortion. People can work in any other job in the world, including all other aspects of medicine, without ever needing to consider having to provide an abortion. Requiring that people be willing to provide abortions if they want to work in this one field only restricts those people from working in this one area.
1.11.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.5.1.2.
1.11.5. Pro: Banning conscientious objection will mean that people who oppose abortion may not enter the medical field. [More than 4 in 10 Americans](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/26/5-facts-about-abortion/) say having an abortion is morally wrong. We want the best doctors and nurses. Therefore we want the most possible applicants to medical and nursing school. We risk lowering applications by as much as 40% by banning conscience objection. Therefore the quality of health practitioners may decline if we ban conscientious objection.
1.11.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.1.1.2.
1.11.6. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.11.7. Con: -> See 1.1.7.5.1.
1.11.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.2.2.1.1.
1.11.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.8.3.5.9.
