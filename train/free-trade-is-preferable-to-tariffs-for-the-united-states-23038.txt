1. Free trade is preferable to Tariffs for the United States.
1.1. Pro: Free trade minimizes the cost for the consumer.
1.2. Con: Tariffs help retain industries stateside.
1.3. Con: Tariffs may be used as leverage in economic or geopolitical negotiations.
1.4. Con: While the U.S. often trades freely, its trading partners do not necessarily follow suit. One way free trade is not necessarily preferable to either two way free trade or two way tariffs.
1.5. Pro: Free trade encourages favorable economic partnerships between countries which improve foreign relations as well.
1.6. Con: Other countries may use government subsidies or currency manipulation to undermine free trade. Tariff structures combat these policies.
