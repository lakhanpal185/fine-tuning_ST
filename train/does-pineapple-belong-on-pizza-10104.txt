Discussion Title: Does pineapple belong on pizza?

1. Pineapple belongs on pizza.
1.1. Con: It's wrong in class terms.  Pizza's are proleterian food - good and cheap and filling.  Pineapples were a complete luxury - to the extent that when they first came to Europe they were displayed rather than eaten, and you can still find gates of mansions topped with stone pineapples because they indicated luxury.

So it's wrong because it's a class war on a plate, and that's exactly what it tastes like.
1.1.1. Con: That some toppings on a pizza aren't available to all \(even historically\), does not mean that others must not enjoy those toppings. One person having pineapple on their pizza does not make pizzas unavailable to the proletariat.
1.1.2. Con: Class war is nice. Pizza could be a symbol for justice and revolution!
1.2. Con: The sweetness of the pineapple is a bad fit for the general taste of the pizza.
1.2.1. Con: Taste is subjective not objective
1.2.2. Pro: According to the [Oxford dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pizza), pizza is "a dish of Italian origin, consisting of a flat round base of dough baked with a topping of tomatoes and cheese, typically with added meat, fish, or vegetables". Pineapple is a fruit.
1.2.2.1. Con: Tomato is also a fruit, as it is a reproductive part of a plant containing fertilised seeds. Being a fruit is no basis for excluding pineapple from a pizza.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: In the [Oxford definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pizza), tomatoes are mentioned separately from vegetables. Therefore a tomato needs not be classified as a vegetable to belong on pizza. Pineapple, and any other kind of fruit, if at all, should be considered an optional topping and there is no place for fruit in toppings according to the definition.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The wording from a specific dictionary isn't definitive. The Online Etymology Dictionary gives 'pizza \(n.\) 1935, from Italian pizza, originally "cake, tart, pie,"'
1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Therefore artichokes, eggplant, mushrooms and others must also be excluded if this narrow definition is considered canon
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Olives are also a fruit
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Capsicum is a fruit
1.2.2.1.4. Pro: Chilli is a fruit
1.2.2.1.5. Con: According to the [Oxford dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/is-a-tomato-a-fruit-or-a-vegetable/), Tomato is typically considered a vegetable in cooking.
1.2.2.1.5.1. Con: If being a fruit is an arbitrary decision based on how it tends to be used, rather than its properties, then you're really saying pineapple shouldn't be on pizza because people don't put it on pizza.
1.2.2.2. Con: The culinary industry is one that requires a masterful artistic technique. Successful art utilizes creativity, taking things that already exist and putting a spin on them, and bending the rules.
1.2.2.3. Con: The Oxford dictionary doesn't provide trademark properties to certain foods but only gives a general description. One is therefore free to change both the ingredients and for example the shape of a pizza, while still considering it to be a pizza as it would be seen as such by a majority of people.
1.2.2.4. Pro: It's no longer a pizza, it's a fruit pie.
1.2.3. Con: The sweetness of the pineapple, when counterbalanced with the saltiness of ham, can be subjectively deemed a tasty combination
1.2.4. Con: Assuming meat is also involved, the idea of combining meat and fruit - so, say, ham and pineapple - is in [no sense new](http://www.dartagnan.com/meat-and-fruit-recipes-and-combinations.html). And is also delicious.
1.2.4.1. Pro: See: [Prosciutto e Melone \(Italian Ham and Melon\)](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/106695/prosciutto-e-melone-italian-ham-and-melon/)
1.2.4.2. Pro: Many love a ham, cheese and pineapple toasted sandwich. It's essentially the same as that.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: Many people dislike Toast Hawaii, for example [Germans](https://www.quora.com/Do-only-Germans-love-to-eat-Toast-Hawaii).
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Germans do not have to eat Hawaiian pizza, but that shouldn't stop other places \(like the US\) from enjoying it.
1.2.4.3. Pro: If people add pineapple to burgers \(both part of American culture\) \([1](https://www.redrobin.com/food-drinks/full-menu-rrgb-t2/gourmet-burgers/banzai-burger.html), [2](https://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/hawaiian-burger/), [3](https://www.bubbas33.com/burgers), [4](https://www.islandsrestaurants.com/menu)\), it just makes sense to add it onto another popular American food: pizza.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Pineapple on burgers \(goes by many names, Hawaiian, teriyaki, aloha...\) in America is not that popular. They are usually available for a limited time \([1](https://www.theimpulsivebuy.com/wordpress/2007/05/28/carls-jr-teriyaki-burger/), [2](https://www.braums.com/menus/the-aloha-burger/)\), as they are rarely on burger restaurant menus \(except for specialty ones\).
1.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Even McDonald's had to remove its [hula burger](http://mcdonalds.wikia.com/wiki/Hula_Burger) \(although it's not a great comparison, because it has no burger patty\) due to its unpopularity.
1.2.4.4. Con: Nobody would dare to order a strawberry pizza.
1.2.4.4.1. Con: And yet it exists and has been ordered by customers.[\[1\] Reviews of strawberry pizza](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608480-d3244138-r506149707-Bali_Strawberry_Farm_Restaurant-Baturiti_Bali.html)[\[2\] Strawberry pizza recipe](https://cookieandkate.com/2013/strawberry-basil-and-balsamic-pizza/)
1.2.4.4.2. Con: [Strawberry with chocolate](http://www.pizzariadanonna.com.br/index.php?p=desc&id=101) is a solid pizza flavour in Brazil.
1.2.4.4.3. Con: Another great innovation, Strawberry pizza sounds delicious
1.2.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.2.5. Con: The sweetness of the pineapple forms a beautiful contrast to the otherwise savory pizza.
1.2.5.1. Pro: The sweet acidity of Pineapple makes hot sauce and pepper flakes really pop.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Mixing sweet and savory tastes is common in other dishes, for instance sweet BBQ sauce on ribs.
1.2.6. Pro: Some people from the southern China prefer their food taste a bit sweet; sweetness make them a good appetite.
1.2.7. Pro: The freshness of pineapple doesn't mix with hot tomato sauce and mozzarella.
1.2.7.1. Con: It's a matter of taste. One can probably find an equal number of people that actually enjoy the combination of flavors against those who don't.
1.2.7.2. Con: The contrast of the fresh pineapple with the hot tomato sauce and mozzarella is delicious.
1.2.8. Con: Adding pinapple makes the pizza more juicy.
1.2.8.1. Pro: The tomato sauce is juicy and sweet too.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: In fact you add salt and cook \(reduce\) it to make it less juicy
1.3. Con: Eating pizza first and pineapple as dessert it will make the whole experience better.
1.3.1. Con: Eating uncooked pineapple can be messy and often detracts from a culinary occasion.
1.3.2. Con: People choose pinapple pizza not because it's a good combination, but because they like pineapples.
1.3.2.1. Con: Many people like coffee, gummie bears, or yoghurt, but those would equally not work on a pizza. Not everything goes together.
1.3.3. Con: Eating pineapple pizza then ice cream as a dessert is a far superior experience.
1.3.4. Con: That just takes too much time and effort for modern times \(especially with millennials who are too lazy to even eat cereal\).
1.4. Con: Pineapple agriculture is heavily pollutant, It destroys lives of people in the tropic, [ticotimes.net](http://www.ticotimes.net/2011/05/26/costa-rica-s-pineapple-boom-unhealthy-warn-experts). Pizza is a product large demand.
1.4.1. Pro: The additional happiness from putting pinapple on pizza does not outweight the pain that pinapple production causes.
1.4.2. Pro: When you choose your pizza toppings it is more important to consider what is ethically right, than to consider your personal taste preference.
1.4.3. Con: This is not an argument on "pineapple on pizza" but on pineapple production in general.
1.4.4. Pro: This page actually says that the harmful effect that is a heavy pollutant and destroys the lives of people in the tropics are actually the herbicides used by some companies- not the pineapples themselves so this wouldn't be a relevant argument.
1.4.5. Con: It doesn't have to be. This is all the more reason to push people towards sustainable growing methods if they opt for such challenge.
1.4.5.1. Pro: There is organic pineapples.
1.4.6. Pro: Pineapples are usually grown in other countries outside of the US, like Costa Rica. If Americans really want an economically- and ecologically-sound toppings, then they really should support locally-grown ones \(like bell peppers\).
1.5. Con: Many people have spoken out publicly against pineapple pizza.
1.5.1. Pro: [Charlie Sheen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen) claims that no straight man wants a ring of pineapple on his ham pizza. [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H57GAAkDzB8)
1.5.1.1. Con: Charlie Sheen's tastes are unlikely to be representative of his own cultural background, let alone globally. His views are no more valid than anyone else's on either side of the argument.
1.5.1.2. Con: It's a fact that lots of straight men like pinapple on pizza.
1.5.1.3. Con: The preferences of straight men is not making something true for everybody. Straight men are not better than other people.
1.5.1.4. Con: Charlie Sheen is not a medical, philosophical, or culinary authority.
1.5.1.5. Con: Charlie Sheen is known for making bad decisions. Pineapples on pizza is yet another one.
1.5.2. Pro: Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay [does not approve of pineapple on pizza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-5IHCJJSPQ).
1.5.3. Con: "someone said it" is not a valid argument.
1.5.4. Con: Many people say the world is flat. The number of people that agree, being more than a few, is not indicative of a statement's validity.
1.6. Con: Pineapple is a wet/moisture bearing topping, which releases water when cooked: the result of which can be a soggy crust.  While pineapple is not an ideal pizza topping, it may be applied directly to the pizza surface by a qualified professional with the appropriate certifications in moisture removal procedures.
1.6.1. Pro: When pineapple is roasted before going on the raw pizza you carmelize natural sugars and get rid of excess water.
1.6.2. Con: Pizza can be a bit dry, so pineapple helps provide much needed moisture.
1.6.3. Con: Pineapple can be added after the pizza is done, because it is edible raw.
1.6.4. Con: The wateriness of the pizza lets one not need to drink as much, as the food becomes both food and drink.
1.6.5. Con: If this is an issue, dried pineapple is an option.
1.6.6. Con: Most pizzas are made without qualified professionals or special 'pizza' certifications \(if they even exist\). Adding pineapple to pizza does not require any of this, otherwise one would see those extra certifications by chefs in restaurants for the pineapple alone.
1.7. Pro: It is a way for students to have a main course and desert in one meal, enabling more time for exstensive learning.
1.8. Con: Pineapple on pizza is an insult to the Italian origins of pizza.
1.8.1. Pro: In Naples, [the home of Pizza culture](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storia_della_pizza), no pizzaiolo accepts pineapple as a topping.
1.8.1.1. Pro: As neapolitan I think It is terrible. It is not pizza. This is the opinion of a citizen of Naples. Pay attention.
1.8.2. Con: 'Hawaiian pizza' is just another type of pizza in New Zealand. The idea of it has been socially reinforced as a great choice forever, now so through the increased accessibility of the $5 pizza craze. Neither pineapple or pizza originate in New Zealand, but pizza with pineapple is a huge part of its culture of food.
1.8.3. Pro: Pineapple pizza is most popular in countries that do not have a very strong food culture \(such as Australia, Canada, UK, Finland or Sweden, ... \).
1.8.4. Pro: Pizza has been recognized as world heritage by UNESCO, [ansa.it](http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2017/12/07/art-of-neapolitan-pizza-wins-unesco-status-3_05fa6a9f-26f6-4cbe-82f1-679474e3630e.html) . As such the traditional recipe should be respected. A yeasted flatbread that does not stick to pizza traditions shouldn't be called pizza.
1.8.5. Con: If everyone tried to be politically correct \(a.k.a. not offend anyone\), then nothing would get created culturally \(including pizza\). Thus, allowing pineapple on pizza \(even if it's not PC\), allows for creative and cultural culinary expression and freedom that we can be lucky to have.
1.8.6. Con: Experimenting with new ingredients is an act of homage toward Italian cuisine, and should not be held hostage by the preferences of cultural elitists.
1.8.7. Con: Placing pineapple on pizza allows people to find another method for enjoying pizza. This keeps the pizza culture alive, so it benefits more than insults pizza.
1.8.8. Con: If [pizza wurstel](http://pizzawuerstel.de/uber/) is ok, pineapple on pizza must be ok, too.
1.8.8.1. Con: Wurstel pizza and pineapple pizza are quite different, it makes no sense to compare them.
1.8.8.2. Con: Two wrongs don't make a right. If one "odd" taste is okay, then another doesn't have to be. Therefore "pizza wurstel" is no reason for pineapple.
1.8.8.3. Con: Pizza with sausage is also not ok.
1.8.8.3.1. Con: Pizza with sausage it's actually pretty common.
1.8.8.4. Pro: In [Korea](https://blog.naver.com/3010462/221245812547), people love to put diverce ingredients on a pizza, including potato, quesadillas or steak.
1.8.8.5. Pro: In Italy, it is not uncommon to see pizza with "fries" on them.
1.8.8.5.1. Pro: 30 years ago a pizza with fries might have been unthinkable, now it's commonplace. Same fate could happen to the pineapple.
1.8.9. Pro: [Hawaiian pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_pizza) is a Canadian invention.
1.8.9.1. Con: Canada is a cultural innovator whose many proud inventions, including [basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naismith), eventually found acceptance in the wider world.
1.8.9.2. Pro: [Sam Panopoulos](https://www.buzzfeed.com/rmolenick/why-pineapple-doesnt-belong-on-pizza-1b0a8?utm_term=.lk0yyWaDp#.wtZbbJ96d), the inventor of the Hawaiian Pizza, is a confused Greek chef in Canada working at a restaurant serving both Italian and Asian cuisine. You would not call him a pizza expert.
1.8.9.2.1. Pro: [Panopoulos claims](https://www.buzzfeed.com/rmolenick/why-pineapple-doesnt-belong-on-pizza-1b0a8?utm_term=.lk0yyWaDp#.wtZbbJ96d) that his pizza was "an invention by accident."
1.8.9.2.1.1. Pro: Panopoulos's pizza only gained popularity because the "[tiki trend](http://www.lamag.com/liquidlablog/the-tiki-trend-is-all-grown-up/)" was still in full swing.
1.8.10. Con: Pizza [did not originate in Italy.](https://macaulay.cuny.edu/eportfolios/rosenberg14/pizza-culture-3/)
1.8.11. Pro: Culinary traditions should be respected, especially considering that [Italy has the best cuisine of the world.](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/world-best-food-cultures/index.html).
1.8.11.1. Con: Culinary traditions are constantly changing.  Tomatoes, the basis of so many Italian dishes, originally came from the Americas and was integrated in to Italian cuisine.  Why not pineapple too?
1.8.11.1.1. Con: Pineapple cannot be grown in Italy unlike tomatoes.
1.8.12. Con: Sticks and stones may break your bones but someone eating a pineapple pizza will never hurt you.
1.8.13. Con: Pizza originated from a long, mediterranean tradition of "bread with stuff on it", in a lot of cases "stuff" was just anything that one had on hand
1.9. Pro: Pineapples make pizza aesthetically pleasing.
1.9.1. Pro: Pineapples make a visually beautiful pizza.
1.9.1.1. Con: People don't eat pizza solely because they look nice.
1.9.1.2. Pro: It adds pretty colors, especially when other toppings of different colors are added too
1.9.1.3. Con: Pineapples are yellow & cheese is also yellow. Do you see the conflict?
1.9.1.3.1. Con: No. Monochromatic dishes aren't inedible. Color coordination & presentation have little to nothing to do with dishes like pizza, because it's really not a high-end dish. Mozzarella cheese, the classic cheese used for pizza is white, so are many mushrooms, a popular pizza topping. Also, there is such a thing as chicken alfredo pizza, both alfredo sauce & chicken are white in color. People don't die or get sick from monochromatic food poisoning.
1.9.2. Pro: Pineapple makes pizza taste better \(more summery and lively\).
1.9.2.1. Pro: Sweetness of pineapple compliments spicy toppings
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Try with japenos and spicy meat
1.9.2.1.2. Pro: Pineapple and Jalapeno with white sauce is a delight for the palette. Sweet and spicy go together nicely. If you are avoiding meat, adding other veggies like mushrooms and onion makes for a pizza you would not miss the meat on.
1.9.2.1.3. Con: If you are trying to mitigate the hot sensation of spicy food like chili then sweet [is not going to do anything](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/resources/highschool/chemmatters/past-issues/archive-2013-2014/peppers.html). The hot sensation in hot chilies come from capsaicin, which dissolve in fat, not in sugar.
1.9.2.2. Pro: The pineapple cleanses the palate from having an overly fatty and savory taste.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: This suggests balance between acid and fat. But in this case, wine is the proper grease solvent.
1.9.2.2.1.1. Con: Wine may be a good alternative, but that doesn't mean pineapple is wrong.
1.9.2.2.1.2. Con: Some people can't drink wine \(because of health issues or because of the budget\).
1.9.2.2.2. Con: You could argue that if you don't like overly fatty taste, maybe a dish made of melted mozzarella was not your best choice in the first place, adding something wrong does not make it right.
1.9.2.3. Pro: Sweet and salty brings an umami that is acceptable the world over. Pineapple and Canadian bacon or ham is so good.
1.9.2.3.1. Con: Umami is a own distinct taste that can not be produced by combining sweet and salty.
1.9.2.3.2. Pro: Pineapple and black olives are a god send.
1.9.2.3.2.1. Pro: According to [myth](https://www.oliveoilsource.com/article/mythology-101-greatest-gift), olives were given as a gift by the goddess Athena. So they are literally sent by a god\(dess\).
1.9.3. Pro: Pineapples make a pizza smell better, like a hint of tropical sweetness that takes a person to a vacation thought \(like Hawaii if they're eating Hawaiian pizza\).
1.10. Pro: Pineapple makes pizza healthier to eat.
1.10.1. Con: Pineapple has fruit sugar. Fruit sugar makes you fat. Pizza makes you lean.
1.10.1.1. Con: It is not fruit sugar that makes people obese, but refined sugar. Sugar in fruit's also accompanied by [other nutrients and fiber](https://www.eatthis.com/fruit-sugar/), which slow its absorption. Thus, pineapple on pizza would be a better option to satisfy a sweet tooth/cravings than eating dessert or drinks \(like soda\) with added sugar instead.
1.10.1.2. Con: Quite the opposite, much childhood obesity stems from pizza, with its [high salt, fat, and calorie levels](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/27412/20150119/the-biggest-cause-of-childhood-obesity-its-pizza.htm).
1.10.2. Con: The \(un\)healthiness of a certain topping is no argument for making its in- or exclusion mandatory.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Pizza itself is considered unhealthy.
1.10.3. Pro: The cheeses associated with pizza \([Mozzarella](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/01026?fgcd=&manu=&format=&count=&max=25&offset=&sort=default&order=asc&qlookup=MOZZARELLA+CHEESE%2C+UPC%3A+072210428509&ds=&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=) and [Parmesan](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/01032?fgcd=&manu=&format=&count=&max=25&offset=&sort=default&order=asc&qlookup=parmesan&ds=&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=)\) contain cholesterol that can [raise cholesterol levels](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/about-cholesterol). Pineapple counteracts this, because it [lowers cholesterol](https://healthfully.com/pineapple-good-lower-cholesterol-5721266.html) instead.
1.10.4. Pro: Pineapple expands vegetarians' choices in pizza.
1.10.4.1. Pro: Pineapple makes choosing toppings easier for vegans \(assuming they are able to choose vegan or no cheese\).
1.10.5. Pro: Pineapple is a [whole food](https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/the-benefits-of-healthy-whole-foods), which incur health benefits that are better than other toppings \(like [salami](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PSryhlYKC4A/TzKDLLA7k2I/AAAAAAAEzE0/C2MN3Ce4LAs/s1600/DOMINO%27S+PIZZA+Crust+Toppings+Choices+List,+Domino%27s+Pizza+Delivery+Choose+Your+Pizza+List.JPG), which tends to have added [nitrates](https://www.livestrong.com/article/506182-lunch-meat-without-sodium-nitrate/)\) or additions to pizza, like [dips](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vtpbBFMEd10/UEfrTrq-pcI/AAAAAAAAB7g/0YIKQsHiOa0/s1600/caesar3.JPG).
1.10.6. Con: Eating too much pineapple can be [harmful](https://www.curejoy.com/content/side-effects-of-pineapple/).
1.10.6.1. Pro: It can cause issues like sensitive teeth or diarrhea.
1.10.6.2. Pro: Eating pineapple is actually harmful because of the flesh-eating acid, [bromelain](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/sciencecommunication/2012/10/07/the-flesh-eating-pineapple/).
1.10.6.2.1. Con: Oxygen causes a natural destructive [oxidative stress](http://undergroundwellness.com/oxygen-is-killing-us/) on the compounds and objects it comes in contact with, including metals and human tissue. The fact is, small amounts of, and the type of exposure to certain toxic substances is inconsequentially "harmful."
1.10.6.2.2. Con: By this logic, existing as a human is actually harmful because of the flesh-eating hydrochloric acid found in your stomach, which does [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NddZ5ftQb0Q) to organic matter
1.10.6.2.3. Con: Bromelain has [health benefits](https://draxe.com/6-unbelievable-health-benefits-bromelain/) too, which outweigh its negatives.
1.10.6.2.3.1. Pro: Because the digestive system renews itself \(it's skin, which heals quickly\), bromelain just helps with that process.
1.11. Pro: Pineapple is a cost effective topping, adding sweetness to the recipe that few other ingredients could at that price point.
1.12. Pro: From a culinary point of view, it's always a good thing to have a another receipe to make.
1.12.1. Pro: Culinary endeavors and creations are subjective, and successful when balancing different tastes and textures. In this method of balancing the sweetness of pineapple, you must utilize saltiness of ham, and it would need to be pretty salty because pineapple is incredibly sweet. Taste is subjective, so know your audience, or stay away if you aren't up for the combination.
1.12.2. Pro: Pineapples allow chefs to take culinary journeys, learning about various cultures in order to utilize them on pizza.
1.12.3. Pro: Pineapple is a versatile topping. From Hawaiian to teriyaki to just pineapple, the options are endless.
1.12.4. Pro: Pizza is like omelets. You add to it what you have.
1.12.5. Con: Anything can be a made up receipe. 1/4 mud, 3/4 water is technically a receipe, yet everyone would agree that it would make a mediocre dish.
1.12.5.1. Con: Inedible ingredients do not provide nutrients, which is the basis of food. Edible ingredients when paired with contrasting or harmonious flavors create desirable recipes.
1.12.5.2. Pro: Putting random food together doesn't make one a good chef.
1.12.5.3. Con: Technically a recipe, but not one that is likely to be in any cookbook or eaten by anyone.  So the argument is invalid.
1.13. Pro: Pineapple adds a texture and mouthfeel \(in between crisp and juicy\) that is missing from most pizzas. Textural variety makes for a more pleasing meal.
1.14. Pro: Yes, but alongside pepperoni not ham
1.15. Pro: It is really funny to have pineapples on pizza, because it is unexpected, unique, and almost strange. That confusion is just funny, which makes the pizza even an more joyful experience to eat.
1.16. Pro: The taste is unusual, which is a good way of changing a routine.
1.16.1. Pro: There is no evolution without transgression. And this transgression is tasteful and yummy. Almost nowhere you can find truly Napolitan Pizza, and you could argue we are way past that when talking about contemporary pizza. Let there be pizza for all and do the evolution, baby.
1.16.2. Pro: Pineapple makes pizza less boring
1.16.3. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.16.4. Con: Taking a shower in the kitchen sink is also a way of changing one's routine, but it's not necessarily a good idea.
1.16.4.1. Con: Many families have used the kitchen sink not only as a food preparation area but also as a baby bathing area \(in small houses, days gone by\).
1.16.4.2. Con: An individual can determine the merits of an idea based on their own preferences, research, testing and feedback.  Nobody is forcing pineapple \(or kitchen sink showers\) on them.
1.16.4.2.1. Pro: Consenting adults should be free to put what they want on their pizzas.
1.16.4.2.1.1. Con: The Pineapple juice infects the rest of the pizza ruining it for everyone else who doesn't like pineapple on the pizza.
1.16.4.2.1.1.1. Con: They don't have to eat that pizza. They can get their own.
1.16.4.2.1.1.2. Con: Mushrooms also have this effect. If mushrooms are accepted on pizza, then pineapple on pizza should be ok too.
1.16.4.2.1.2. Pro: Some people like it, and others have no right to dictate their taste.
1.16.4.2.1.2.1. Con: Some people have a more developed taste.
1.16.4.2.1.2.2. Con: Warm fruit is not nice
1.16.4.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: It’s one of your five fruit and veg portions a day
1.16.4.2.1.3. Con: If ordering a pizza for a party, the pineapple-loving adult might order an hawaiian pizza on an unshared taste.
1.16.4.2.1.3.1. Con: This can be the case for any individual agreement.  Anchovies for example are not loved by all, and some are allergic.
1.16.4.2.1.3.2. Con: Any party organiser should be aware of the tastes and preferences of their guests and order a variety of flavours.
1.16.4.2.1.4. Con: Consenting adults are free to put poop on their pizzas. That doesn't meen poop belongs on pizza.
1.16.4.2.1.4.1. Con: In terms of a free market: If there is considerable amount of people who would pay for pizza with poop, it would actually belong on pizza. 
On the other hand if it is a matter of origin salami also doesn't belong on pizza.
1.16.4.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Whether a ingredient is considered to belong in a meal should not be decided by free market, but by reason and knowledge.
1.16.4.2.1.4.2. Con: Comparing casually edible items \(pineapple is a fruit\) with casually inedible items \(excrement is lacking in nutrition and is somewhat poisonous to the point where you would get sick and possibly die\) is not equal in this argument.
1.16.4.2.1.5. Pro: People usually know what they like and don't like. If we let people decide for themselves what food they want to eat, people will choose the food they find most tasty. The pleasure and happiness in the world would be maximized, which is morally right.
1.16.4.2.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.16.4.2.1.5.2. Con: Maximizing ones pleasure doesn't mean global, overall pleasure is maximized. A little pleasure to one can mean a lot of discomfort to others, therefore the netto overall pleasure rate can go down.
1.16.4.2.1.6. Con: Pineapple on pizza didn't make it through the early drafts of the UN declaration on human rights....with good reason.  You can't smoke next to me in a restaurant either.
1.16.4.2.1.7. Pro: A sufficient number of people like pineapple on pizza that it should be accepted as a legitimate topping, even by those that dislike it.
1.16.4.2.1.8. Con: Oh! So we should allow unborn fetuses on pizza then?! Where does the madness stop?
1.16.4.2.1.8.1. Con: Slippery slope fallacy is not a proper argument.
1.16.4.2.1.8.2. Con: Pineapple is a food eaten all around the world.  Unborn fetuses are generally not considered a food, so are unlikely to be added to pizza.
1.16.4.2.1.8.2.1. Con: There may be [some cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_cannibalism) where fetuses are considered food.
1.16.4.2.1.9. Con: People should not put [tide pods](https://www.kialo.com/8888) on their pizzas.
1.16.4.2.1.10. Con: It is unfair to minors to have all their pizza toppings dictated.
1.16.4.2.1.11. Pro: All pizza toppings should be allowed that do not severely injure either the eater or anyone not consuming those toppings.
1.16.4.2.1.12. Pro: Backwards-thinking people can always pick off the pineapple if they don't want it on their pizza.
1.16.4.2.1.12.1. Con: It can be difficult to remove the flavour of the disliked ingredient from an existing pizza. Better not to add it in the first place if there are likely to be people who don't like pineapple. \(same for all ingredients\)
1.16.4.2.1.13. Pro: Pineapple brings common pizza up to the level of prosciutto e melone. It's an elevated experience that, while it may be an acquired taste, is worth persevering with.
1.16.4.2.1.14. Con: Which food ingredients are recommended to belong together should be decided by reason and knowledge. People are of course free to combine whatever ingredients in any way they want, but that does not mean we can't make a good recommendation.
1.16.4.2.2. Con: However, as the original argument phrased it, the novelty or originality of putting pineapple on pizza in and of itself was used as an argument in support of putting pineapple on pizza, which is clearly a non-argument
1.16.5. Pro: Trying new things, being adventurous, taking on new challenges can broaden your horizons and open opportunities for new adventures and experiences.  It can help you develop as a human being.
1.17. Con: Torture is wrong. In today's day and age, we should have moved well beyond this kind of barbarism. It's cruel to a tropical fruit to be stuck on top of a pizza and be shoved into an oven.
1.17.1. Con: It's not any less 'cruel' to kill, chop & cook any of the other toppings. To argue this is to suggest we shouldn't eat anything that hasn't died of natural causes.
1.17.2. Pro: Baking a pineapple is bad in general, but putting it on a pizza and baking it? That's just wrong.
1.17.3. Con: Preventing people from enjoying the delicious taste of pineapple on their pizza could also be considered a form of torture.
1.17.4. Con: Pinapples are not sentient beings and can not feel pain.
1.17.5. Pro: The taste of pineapple is very strong. this leads to some humans tasting it being tortured
1.18. Con: You cannot eat Spongebob's house and be considered a good person at the same time.
1.18.1. Con: Spongebob is an annoying character, depriving him of habitat may result in his extinction, which would be a public service, like eradicating a disease
1.18.1.1. Con: Killing one annoying character could lead to legitimising murder of more characters that are less annoying.
1.18.1.2. Con: Everybody is annoying to somebody at some time. You can't kill everybody.
1.18.1.3. Con: Pineapple on pizza is annoying to some people.  Eradicating it would be a public service.
1.18.2. Pro: Eating SpongeBob's house would encourage him to move out and find a bigger better house. \(Not made of fruit.\)
1.18.3. Con: Few people would like to eat a pineapple that's been in the ocean with a sponge and snail living in it. Because of this, Spongebob has no worries about losing his home. People should have a preference for above-ground pineapples anyway.
1.18.4. Con: Every time Spongebob's house got messed up, a new pineapple would grow in replace of it \(or the pineapple got fixed\). Since pineapples are able to be replaced quickly underwater, I'm sure Spongebob would not have to worry about his home being gone. This process imposes no judgment on character, because Spongebob does not miss out on anything.
1.18.5. Con: If Spongebob took out an insurance policy on his house and needed the money for posterior rounding medical procedures, then the net effect is good. Ethics may not even enter the question for the eater of the house, if they are starving and did not know the pineapple was occupied.
1.18.6. Con: Spongebob is not a real person and doesn't live in a real house.  \(also, the Easter Bunny is not real - sorry\)
1.18.6.1. Con: [The existence of the easter bunny is a verifiable fact.​](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvbPMXhKWYg)
1.18.6.2. Con: Basing your moral decisions on what is good or bad for fictional characters makes your life funnier, and other people will laugh.
1.18.7. Con: Spongebob's pineapple house is animated.  Even if it is eaten, the animator can easily draw a new one.
1.18.7.1. Con: Drawing and animating a pinapple is a time-consuming and energy-demanding work. Forcing animators to do that more than they have to is not fair or nice.
1.18.7.1.1. Con: Animators can gain the energy they need to draw and animate a pineapple by eating a pineapple pizza.  The sweet pineapple is high in energy.
1.19. Pro: -> See 1.16.4.2.1.
1.20. Pro: We don't have to call it "authentic Italian" but one only needs to look at other yummy foods such as sushi and how they've been reinvented in other cultures with moderately tasty results.
