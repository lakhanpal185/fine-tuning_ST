Discussion Title: Should The Catholic Church Publicly Elect Its Leaders?

1. The Catholic Church should publicly elect its leaders.
1.1. Con: Organizing such elections would be a huge drain on the Church's resources.
1.1.1. Pro: Church money could be better spent on charitable causes, or on causes that directly benefit the congregation.
1.1.1.1. Con: In the status quo, the Church's holdings are worth an [incredible amount of money](http://nationalpost.com/news/wealth-of-roman-catholic-church-impossible-to-calculate). Clearly, holding resources for purposes other than charity or direct benefit of the congregation is not against Catholic doctrine.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Canon law requires churches to invest in things like [tabernacles](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P3C.HTM) that are conspicuous, beautifully decorated, and suitable for prayer because they inspire faith, so there is theological justification for the church's wealth.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Despite what the faith might say, gold plated tabernacles might objectively be a waste of money.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Since investing in tabernacles is a way of achieving the purpose of the faith, it cannot objectively be a waste of money.
1.1.1.2. Con: The question of whether the money could be better spent elsewhere is reliant on first determining how valuable elections are.
1.1.2. Con: The need to fund elections may help the church prioritise the allocation of its resources from [tabernacles made of gold](https://aleteia.org/2017/07/13/what-is-a-tabernacle/) to engaging with the flock more meaningfully.
1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3. Con: It is not terribly difficult to organize and fund a letter-mailing and ballot-counting organization.
1.1.4. Con: The Catholic Church has more than enough [wealth](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-12/catholic-church-worth-$30-billion-investigation-finds/9422246) to be able to afford this.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The Economist estimated that the Catholic church was worth [$170 billion](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2012/08/17/the-economist-estimates-the-catholic-church-spent-171600000000-in-2010/) in 2010.
1.1.4.2. Con: Just because the Catholic Church has wealth, does not mean it ought to be spent in the organization of elections. Every dollar spent on elections is a dollar that could be spent on other, more beneficial causes.
1.1.5. Con: The Catholic Church could make use of the internet for the elections, making geographical distance a non-issue.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Having voters use e-signature to sign their ballots would also prevent voter-fraud from occuring.
1.1.5.2. Con: It would exclude many Christians without internet access.
1.1.6. Pro: There are an estimated [1.2 billion Catholics](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-21443313) in the world. The logistics and manpower needed to organise elections for that number of people would be enormous.
1.1.6.1. Con: India has roughly the same number of citizens and has been able to organize fair central and local elections since 1947. If a developing nation can manage to do it, so can the Catholic Church.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: The Catholic Church's voter base is distributed in every country in the world, not geographically limited like Indian citizens. As such, it would be logistically much harder than an Indian election.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: It may be easier, given each individual election is smaller and more manageable; there are just many of them.
1.1.6.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.2. Pro: Public elections could see the Church address a lot of its deep-rooted, structural issues.
1.2.1. Pro: The Catholic Church has infamously large issues with sexual abuse within its organization.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The Vatican has [systematically](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25757218) adopted policies that have allowed Church officials to sexually abuse thousands of children. Public elections will enable people to ensure that the candidates running for election will make this issue a priority if they are to be elected.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Pope Francis has himself admitted that the Vatican has over [2000 pending sexual assault cases](https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201947/http://www.sfgate.com/news/crime/article/Pope-acknowledges-2-000-case-backlog-in-sex-abuse-11144008.php) to be processed.
1.2.1.3. Con: [Many laypeople directly participated in or failed to prevent](https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/report-ramifications) sexual assault in the church, so it's not clear giving laypeople more control will decrease this problem.
1.2.2. Pro: Elected leaders would not owe their power, authority, and status to the existing power structures, and thus would be more willing to make structural changes.
1.2.3. Con: Elected governments have significant problems enacting even minor changes.
1.2.3.1. Pro: This problem would be exacerbated by the Church's large number of very conservative followers.
1.2.3.2. Con: The members of the Church should be more unified than the citizens of a democratic country, as all Church members adhere to the same core belief as followers of Catholicism.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: The bond of the Catholic identity may not unify Catholics sufficiently to survive the adversarial nature of elections, given the variety among [different types of Catholics](http://www.equip.org/article/what-are-the-different-types-of-catholics/), from those who identify with Catholic culture from their upbringing, to the ultra devout, and how divided these groups are already.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: Given the existence of numerous disagreements strong enough to cause the creation of new branches of [faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Schisms_from_the_Catholic_Church), this has clearly proven itself to be false.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: Because of the wealth of choices available in the Christian faith, it is more likely that members of each individual branch will feel strongly aligned with their chosen denomination.
1.2.3.2.3. Pro: Many of those who disagree with how the Catholic Church operates are likely to convert to another branch within Christianity. This means that those who remain Catholic are more likely to have similar views.
1.2.3.3. Pro: There is increased bureaucracy in political structures which prevent governments from enacting changes.
1.2.3.4. Con: Even minor changes to the church would still benefit members of the faith.
1.2.4. Pro: Until the Middle Ages Church leaders were [elected by popular vote](http://juiciobrennan.com/files/bishopselection/bishopSelectionFlier.pdf). Sociocultural reasons, not religious reasons, are why public elections are not used to determine the leaders of the Church today.
1.2.4.1. Pro: In fact, it was not until 1917 that the [Code of Canon Law](http://juiciobrennan.com/files/bishopselection/bishopSelectionFlier.pdf) was drawn up and the Pope was officially given the authority to appoint all bishops of the Catholic Church.
1.2.4.2. Con: The results of this process didn't have good results. Therefore this argument "it has been done before, society changed it" should go against the idea of it returning.
1.2.4.3. Con: These elections caused secular leaders to try to influence the Church.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: One example of popular elections allowing secular influence on the Church was the election of Cornelius. He was elected as a Church leader by both religious and lay people. Baumgartner, Frederic J. \(2003\). Behind Locked Doors: A History of the Papal Elections. Palgrave Macmillan.
1.2.5. Con: Elected governments have deep-rooted structural issues, mainly because of bribes and such. Therefore public election might not be the solution for the Church
1.2.5.1. Con: An accountable democratic system is likely to be comparatively less corrupt than an unaccountable non-democratic system.
1.3. Con: If the Catholic Church abandons one of its primary theological beliefs, then it will no longer be taken seriously.
1.3.1. Pro: Changes from traditional church doctrine often make more conservative Catholics feel [disillusioned](https://globalnews.ca/news/3765413/pope-francis-accused-of-spreading-heresy-by-conservative-catholic-theologians/) with the Church.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The Catholic Church is already going through a lot of changes.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Pope Francis has brought about a decentralisation of power in the Church.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Local bishops now get to control the [liturgical translation](https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/09/09/pope-pushes-decentralization-translation-liturgical-texts/) used in their diocese.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Decentralisation of power means more accountability. Increased accountability will provide a greater incentive for members of the Catholic Church to conduct themselves more responsibly, thus significantly changing the overall standards of the Church.
1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Bishops would have more [authority](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUKKCN0SB0UI20151017) to make decisions affecting the lives of people in their local communities instead of always looking to Rome for a centralised decision that has to fit all. So if any problems were to arise, more accountability would fall upon the shoulders of Bishops instead of Rome.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that these progressive changes are likely to continue when Pope Francis is no longer the Pope.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: This is not unique to the current process of appointing Catholic officials. Even democratically elected governments often undo or change laws passed by previous governments.
1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: Many of the decisions Pope Francis has made, such as choosing to elevate more moderate bishops into positions of leadership within the Church, will [leave a legacy](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-pope-francis-matters_us_55d370dee4b07addcb443e0c). The impact of these decisions will be felt in years to come due to the ability of these leaders to influence continuing progression and moderation with the Church, a very traditional institution.
1.3.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Pope Francis has set a precedent that popes should be able to progress and influence Church doctrine and teachings; future popes will find it easier to do the same as a result.
1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Pope Francis has made the Catholic church significantly more open and welcoming.
1.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: Pope Francis has tried to [encourage](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/13/pope-endorsement-softens-stance-on-divorced-catholics) Catholic priests to give communion to some divorced and remarried couples, or to families where unmarried parents are cohabiting. These statements have contributed to division among Catholics.
1.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: Pope Francis is a 'man of the people', coming from a pastoral background, rather than an academic background. Many [feel this aids him](https://theweek.com/articles/685573/why-conservative-catholics-think-pope-francis-fraud) in understanding issues that are relevant for the world's Catholics.
1.3.1.1.3.3. Pro: Pope Francis [has said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/02/23/pope-francis-praises-the-torah-and-suggests-its-better-to-be-an-atheist-than-a-bad-catholic/?utm_term=.a072b95422a2) that atheists can still go to heaven by doing good deeds in their lives.
1.3.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Previously, Church doctrine stated that [only believers](http://www.traditionalcatholicpriest.com/2016/10/14/why-pope-francis-is-a-false-prophet/) would be admitted to heaven, that good deeds alone were not sufficient.
1.3.1.1.3.4. Pro: Pope Francis has [instructed priests](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/09/24/false-prophet-why-pope-francis-has-disappointed-many-roman-catholics.html) to allow those who have had abortions to receive Holy Communion.
1.3.1.1.3.5. Pro: Pope Francis has actively encouraged young people to participate and have a say in the running of the Church.
1.3.1.1.3.5.1. Pro: Pope Francis decided that the theme of the 15th Ordinary General Meeting of the Synod of Bishops should be ["Youth, faith, and vocational discernment"](http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2016/10/06/161006b.html).
1.3.1.1.3.5.1.1. Pro: Pope Francis encouraged young Catholics to contribute to the Synod of Bishops using [social media](https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2018/02/18/pope-urges-youth-go-online-give-church-earful/) and a specifically youth-moderated [questionnaire.](http://www.usccb.org/about/bishops-and-dioceses/synod-of-bishops/synod-2018/index.cfm)
1.3.1.1.3.5.1.2. Pro: Pope Francis wrote a [letter to young people](https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/letters/2017/documents/papa-francesco_20170113_lettera-giovani-doc-sinodo.html) ahead of the Synod.
1.3.1.1.3.5.1.3. Pro: The church has traditionally been steered by the clergy, who are all adult men. The inclusion of youth in the Synod of Bishops shows a willingness to reinvigorate the Church in a way that previous popes have failed to do.
1.3.1.1.3.6. Con: Pope Francis has a [mixed record](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/01/30/581546577/after-defending-controversial-bishop-pope-to-send-sex-abuse-investigator-to-chil) on fighting sexual abuse within the church.
1.3.1.1.3.7. Pro: The status quo is sufficient to modernize the Church.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1. Pro: Pope Francis is very popular with the general public.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.1. Pro: Pope Francis is also [notable](https://relevantmagazine.com/current/why-pope-so-popular) for his support among non-Catholics, especially evangelical Christians and Protestants.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.2. Pro: The Pope was named '[Person of the Year](https://relevantmagazine.com/current/why-pope-so-popular)' by TIME magazine.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.2.1. Con: Time has been known for many [controversial](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/time-magazine-10-controversial-people-year-article-1.2040428) "People of the Year", including Ayatollah Khomeini, Adolf Hitler, and Joseph Stalin. The award itself does not indicate any specific "goodness".
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.3. Pro: For example, [88% of American Catholics](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/why-pope-francis-is-so-effective-8-lessons-for-every-leader.html) responded, when asked in a survey, that they think he is doing a good job.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4. Con: The Pope's popularity with the general public comes at the expense of having alienated many of the world's conservative Catholics.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.1. Con: It is somewhat inevitable that whatever the Pope does will divide the Church. For every Catholic who would like to see their progressive values reflected in their faith, there are staunch opponents of these changes. No matter what the Pope does or doesn't do, he is likely to alienate one of these groups.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.1.1. Pro: Many of the Pope's statements are unpopular because they reflect his political/ social opinions, but many of the controversial statements are [not actually contrary to Christian doctrine](https://theweek.com/articles/685573/why-conservative-catholics-think-pope-francis-fraud).
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Others, such as his statements surrounding who can receive communion, are [not in line with existing Church doctrine](https://theweek.com/articles/685573/why-conservative-catholics-think-pope-francis-fraud).
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Pope’s doctrinal chief Gerhard Mueller [opposes](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-pope-conservatives-2017-story.html%3FoutputType%3Damp) the Pope’s suggestion to allow remarried Catholics to take communion.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Pope Francis has said that Catholics in [mortal sin](http://www.traditionalcatholicpriest.com/2016/10/14/why-pope-francis-is-a-false-prophet/) should still be allowed receive Holy Communion, something that was previously prohibited.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.1.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.1.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.1.2. Con: The Pope's indifference to the impact of his words and actions is deeply offensive to many conservative Christians, with some concerned that it [may cause a schism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2015/09/18/francis-is-a-global-sensation-but-to-certain-traditional-catholics-his-message-rings-hollow/) within the Church.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Others offended by the Pope have encouraged Catholics to [demand his resignation](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/06/17/enough-is-enough-pope-francis-should-resign.html).
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2. Pro: A good Pope is one who is able to unite people under his leadership. But the Pope’s liberal attitude towards religious matters has left the Catholic Church bitterly divided.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.1.1.1.1.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.2. Pro: Pope Francis replaced the conservative [doctrine chief](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4657528/Pope-Francis-shakes-Vatican.html) further emboldening the divide between conservative and liberal members of the Church.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.3. Pro: Some priests have accused Pope Francis of [heresy](http://www.traditionalcatholicpriest.com/2016/10/14/why-pope-francis-is-a-false-prophet/) for his efforts to modernise Church doctrine.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.3.1. Con: Pope Francis, being God's representative on Earth, has more legitimate grounds on which to decide what is heretical and what is not than priests.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.3.2. Con: Previous popes were also [accused of heresy](https://cruxnow.com/commentary/2017/02/12/since-francis-continuity-tradition-critics-arent/).
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.3.2.1. Pro: St. John Paul II was [accused](https://cruxnow.com/commentary/2017/02/12/since-francis-continuity-tradition-critics-arent/) of modernism and syncretism.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.3.2.2. Pro: Benedict XVI admitted that "he was on the so-called “progressive” side during Vatican II, and the accusations of [modernism and heresy](https://cruxnow.com/commentary/2017/02/12/since-francis-continuity-tradition-critics-arent/) against their side was abundant".
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.1.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.4. Con: Pope Francis has reached out to the [Old Catholic Church](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-reaches-out-to-schismatic-old-catholic-church-28251).
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.1.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.6. Pro: Pope Francis himself admits unashamedly that his progressive views may render history holding him responsible for “[having split the Catholic Church](https://onepeterfive.com/pope-francis-reported-words-might-go-history-split-church/)”.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.7. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.1.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.8. Pro: His approval rating with conservative Catholics is [much lower](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2015/09/18/francis-is-a-global-sensation-but-to-certain-traditional-catholics-his-message-rings-hollow/) than his general approval rating. While nearly 90% of American Catholics approve of Francis, only 45% of conservative Catholics approve of him.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.8.1. Pro: This approval rating has [dropped significantly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2015/09/18/francis-is-a-global-sensation-but-to-certain-traditional-catholics-his-message-rings-hollow/) in a year, from 72% to 45%.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.9. Pro: Many conservative Catholics feel [deserted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2015/09/18/francis-is-a-global-sensation-but-to-certain-traditional-catholics-his-message-rings-hollow/) by his weak stance on issues such as contraception and abortion and betrayed by his tolerant stance on moral issues.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.9.1. Pro: Pope Francis offended many Catholics by suggesting their marriages could be considered invalid, [claiming](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/06/17/enough-is-enough-pope-francis-should-resign.html) "the great majority of our sacramental marriages are null".
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.10. Con: On other matters the Pope has shown a more conservative attitude. For example, despite the Church's move away from use of the devil in their teachings, Pope Francis has made so many references to 'the devil' and 'evil' that some have called it an '[obsession](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/20/living/pope-francis-devil/index.html)'.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.10.1. Con: The frequency of how often they are referenced is irrelevant as the concept of ‘evil’ and the existence of the ‘devil’ is central to the Christian belief shared by both conservatives and liberals.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.10.1.1. Pro: Large sections of the Bible refer to [demons and the devil](https://www.crosswalk.com/church/pastors-or-leadership/ask-roger/why-don-t-pastors-preach-and-teach-more-on-demons.html).
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.10.1.2. Con: While the devil is central in earlier Christian teachings, modern Catholic doctrine avoided teachings on the devil, due to [fear](http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/christianity/why-the-church-doesnt-preach-on-hell.aspx?p=2) it would alienate modern Catholics. In emphasising Church teaching on the devil, Pope Francis has reconnected with a more traditional Christian belief.
1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.7.1.4.2.8.
1.3.1.1.3.8. Pro: Pope Francis has explicitly committed to a church "[for the poor](https://www.vox.com/cards/who-is-pope-francis/what-are-the-hallmarks-of-francis-theology)".
1.3.1.1.3.8.1. Pro: If anything, these statements have brought the Church back in line with original Gospel teachings, and away from a prior legacy of greed and extravagance exemplified by the [Indulgences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence) and [Vatican wealth](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/how-rich-vatican-so-wealthy-it-can-stumble-across-millions-euros-just-tucked-away-1478219).
1.3.1.1.3.8.2. Con: Pope Francis has been implicated in a [financial scandal](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/leaked-docs-raise-question-of-popes-personal-role-in-new-vatican-financial).
1.3.1.1.3.8.3. Pro: Pope Francis has committed to [leading by example](https://relevantmagazine.com/current/why-pope-so-popular) by rejecting some of the luxury, or 'special treatment', of being Pope. He has opted for smaller, less luxurious living quarters, and has taken public transport.
1.3.1.1.3.8.4. Pro: Pope Francis directed Vatican employees to [donate their bonus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/pope-francis-redirects-employee-bonuses-to-charity/2013/04/18/56a472ce-a85a-11e2-9e1c-bb0fb0c2edd9_story.html?utm_term=.b4718efd1594) they received once he ascended to the papacy to charity.
1.3.1.1.3.9. Pro: As the first [Jesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus) pope, Pope Francis has brought in the Jesuit community that had previously largely been estranged from the Catholic Church.
1.3.1.1.3.10. Con: Pope Francis has a track record of extreme homophobia. His papacy is a clear sign that the Catholic church does still not recognise LGBTQ* individuals as equal.
1.3.1.1.3.10.1. Pro: He has [reaffirmed](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/lgbt-advocates-express-frustration-over-vatican-document-barring-gay-priests) the Catholic Church's ban on ordaining gay priests.
1.3.1.1.3.10.2. Pro: Despite other claims the Pope has previously made, he remains [opposed to same-sex marriage.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/pope-francis-warns-that-same-sex-marriage-threatens-the-family-and-disfigures-gods-plan-for-creation-9986028.html)
1.3.1.1.3.10.3. Con: Francis has publicly advocated for Catholics to [apologise to the LGBT community.](https://www.advocate.com/religion/2016/6/27/pope-francis-catholics-should-apologize-lgbt-community)
1.3.1.1.3.10.4. Pro: Even as pope, Francis has [not changed](https://www.vox.com/cards/who-is-pope-francis/what-is-francis-attitude-toward-gay-people) the church's doctrine on LGBTQ* issues.
1.3.1.1.3.10.4.1. Con: Insofar as religion is concerned, the Pope does not have the authority to countermand the will of God on the subject.
1.3.1.1.3.10.4.1.1. Pro: Many bishops and cardinals believe that the Pope has [no jurisdiction or ability](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/20/world/catholic-church-change/index.html) to change the doctrine of the church, but an obligation to preserve it.
1.3.1.1.3.10.5. Pro: Pope Francis compared arguments for transgender rights to [the nuclear arms race.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/pope-francis-compares-arguments-for-transgender-rights-to-nuclear-arms-race-10061223.html)
1.3.1.1.3.10.6. Con: Pope Francis has been the most accepting Pope of the gay community to date, [asking](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/27/the-war-against-pope-francis) "Who am I to judge?" in their regard.
1.3.1.1.3.10.7. Pro: He has [described](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/2869221) same-sex marriage as the work of the devil and a “destructive attack on God’s plan.” He has also said that gay adoption is a form of discrimination against children.
1.3.1.1.3.11. Pro: Pope Francis has stated that the church should apologise for its ["blessing of many weapons"](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/26/483630582/pope-francis-church-should-apologize-to-gays-and-other-marginalized-groups), specifically against women, children, the LGBT community, and the poor.
1.3.1.2. Pro: A lot of the Church's members are conservative.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: [50% of US Catholics](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/150917-data-points-how-catholic-population-has-shifted-in-the-united-states/) are aged 50 or over. As older people are [more likely to be conservative](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mr-personality/201410/why-are-older-people-more-conservative), drastic progress change could drive them from the Catholic Church.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Adapting to modern ideals would make the Church more appealing to young people, which helps ensure the continued existence of the Church.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: If the Church strategically picks which ideals to promote in order to secure its own longevity, it undermines the importance of Catholic doctrine in the Church.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The spiritual teachings of a religious institution cannot be changed by the popular opinions of the time without the validity of those tenets being heavily questioned.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Literally all religions do this. Judaism, for example, has a list of 613 biblically proscribed "[mitzvot](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/1/11/1619079/-Comparing-Presidential-Administrations-by-Arrests-and-Convictions-A-Warning-for-Trump-Appointees)" or "commandments," at least 111 of which regard sacrifices and offerings, and are thus considered obsolete.
1.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.3.2. Con: Interpretations of primary theological beliefs have always been subject to change and development over time. Not adapting to meet the demands of a forever evolving world undermines the relevance of the Catholic Church and its teachings in the lives of people.
1.3.2.1. Pro: [Catholic](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/26/opinion/since-when-has-the-catholic-church-not-changed.html) doctrine has changed over time to respond to evolving social attitudes.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The Catholic Church practiced slavery for many years and did [not condemn](http://www.globalblackhistory.com/2015/11/the-role-of-the-roman-catholic-church-in-slavery.html) it until the 17th century.
1.3.2.3. Pro: The church teachings used to [condemn](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/history-shows-the-church-has-changed-its-moral-teachings-1.437230) the modern liberties of freedom, equality and participation of citizens in civic and political life.
1.3.2.4. Con: Changes such as this are never a fully conscious decision, rather they are a slow and gradual process developing over decades. We have no right to make changes based on our feelings to traditions dating back hundreds of years.
1.3.2.5. Con: Catholic Doctrine never changes - it evolves and takes on new nuance and significance, but it does not \(and fundamentally cannot\) change from an earlier point of view on a revealed truth
1.3.3. Con: In the ordination rite for deacons, priests, and bishops, the role of the people is already acknowledged. The people are called to assent to the person called. The Bishop asks those presenting the candidate "Are they worthy?" and those presenting the candidate respond that "After inquiry among the Christian people and upon the recommendation of those responsible, I testify that they have been found worthy." This acknowledges that the people's assent is required.
1.3.4. Pro: Apostolic Authority is the bedrock of the church and without it, there is no Catholic Church. For those not knowing of the term, Apostolic Authority is the lineage of bishops anointed and trained by other bishops all the way back to Christ through the Apostles.
1.3.5. Con: Many people in today's society already do not take the belief seriously as many Catholics do not follow catholic doctrine strictly.
1.4. Pro: This would make the members feel more engaged in the Church.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.4.2. Pro: A lot of modern people feel less in touch with the Church and its practices. Allowing public elections would give them a voice and a greater ability to modernize the Church.
1.4.2.1. Pro: [71%](http://www.pewforum.org/2009/04/27/faith-in-flux3/) of former Catholics left the Church because their spiritual needs were not being met. Public elections will allow people a greater voice to ensure that their elected representatives of the Church uphold the spiritual needs of the public.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: The Catholic Church is what the Church is. If people's spiritual needs are not met via Catholic doctrine, they should be welcome to seek alternative denominations.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.
1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.1.1.
1.4.2.3. Con: A [survey in 2012](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2012/08/06/most-u-s-catholics-say-they-are-satisfied-with-the-leadership-provided-by-u-s-nuns-and-sisters/) found that nearly three quarters of Catholics were satisfied with the leaders of their Church, which suggests that members may not need to feel, or be, more engaged with the selection of Church leader.
1.4.3. Pro: Publicly elected leaders have better incentives to engage well with the public than internally appointed leaders.
1.4.3.1. Pro: When your position depends on the goodwill of the public, you are more likely to listen to their concerns and treat them well in order to improve your own position in the hierarchy.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Public pressure has caused [more](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/vatican-accepts-resignation-of-bishop-of-kildare-and-leighlin-1.655693) [accountability](https://www.rte.ie/news/2009/1217/125486-abuse/) with [abusive priests](http://archive.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories/032902_poland.htm) than the internal system of the church had previously. This pressure can disincentivise actions before they take place.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.4.3.3. Con: The purpose of the church is not to be popular or representative, but to follow what their religion teaches is correct.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.4.2.3.
1.4.5. Con: A religion \(apart from anthropologic/biologic discussions\) from its own perspective is not about feeling engaged, but about following a truth apart from any feeling. Anything else is a non-essential positive add on or consequence. So it is irrelevant for the purpose.
1.5. Con: The Church is a divine institution and its leaders should therefore be selected by God and God's spokespersons.
1.5.1. Pro: According to Catholic teachings, the foundation of [authority](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c2a2.htm) lies in understanding human nature. God has defined what constitutes human nature therefore only God and God's representatives on Earth are best qualified to decide who should be elected.
1.5.2. Con: Catholic teachings concede that the Bible is the [inspired](http://www.aboutcatholics.com/beliefs/catholics-believe-bible/) word of God rather than the literal word of God. This implies that traditionally held catholic teachings such as how the Catholic church elects its leaders can be subject to change.
1.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.5.3. Con: Presumably, all candidates for the positions will feel called by God to run, just like priests feel called to the priesthood in the status quo.
1.5.3.1. Con: While God may call upon certain individuals to run for certain positions, God does not determine the free will of the individuals who vote on the candidates.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: This means that people who decided to run for candidacy without being called by God, may end up being successful if the members decide to vote for them over the candidates who were called upon by God.
1.5.3.1.2. Con: The underlying assumption of current Vatican elections is that God speaks through the Cardinals. There is no reason to think that God guides the selections of Church officials more directly than the voting decisions of individual Catholics.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: Church officials are church officials precisely because they have a stronger connection to God, meaning that God has a greater influence over these individuals than average voters.
1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.5.3.1.2.
1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.5.6. Pro: It is implied in the [New Testament](https://www.xenos.org/essays/what-makes-someone-christian-leader) that Church leaders should be chosen by God.
1.5.6.1. Con: The Pope is [democratically elected](http://www.catholic-pages.com/pope/election.asp) by the College of Cardinals, not chosen by God.
1.5.6.2. Con: In the Book of Acts the Apostles choose between two candidates \(Justus and Matthias\) the replacement of Judas by casting lots. Was they an act of chance \(Flipping a coin!\) or was it a vote? \(Acts 1\) It was the community that choose the first seven deacons \(Acts 6\) who were then confirmed in their role by the Apostles. Shows a scriptual basis for community involvement.
1.6. Con: Having public elections would make the Church become less about Christianity and more about politics.
1.6.1. Con: More church politics would mean more productive discussions on how to make the Church more about Christianity.
1.6.1.1. Con: More Church politics could also mean more ad Hominem attacks, as has become the norm in modern politics, as opposed to the discussion of real policy issues.
1.6.2. Con: The Catholic church already suffers from [internal politics](https://nypost.com/2014/12/22/pope-blasts-vatican-bureaucracy-for-having-spiritual-alzheimers/) among its highest officials, who Pope Francis says are so preoccupied with their own status that they have forgotten their obligation to God.
1.6.3. Pro: Public elections would encourage candidates to appeal to voters that hold beliefs which are contrary to established Catholic doctrine, putting political expediency above staying true to the Catholic teachings.
1.6.3.1. Con: It is unlikely that devoted Catholics, the people most likely to participate in elections, will be willing to vote for candidates with wildly "uncatholic" beliefs.
1.6.4. Pro: Public elections will open the door for wealthy donors to fund the campaigns of those running for election.
1.6.4.1. Con: The ability to use money to influence the Church's leadership isn't any more difficult in the status quo. Wealthy donors can still sponsor parts of the Church in order to influence its leadership without the existence of public elections.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Candidates will be influenced to put the vested interests of wealthy donors over the interests of the public.
1.6.4.3. Pro: Candidates who receive more funding for their campaigns than other candidates will have greater exposure to potential voters putting them at an unfair advantage over their competition.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Winning an election for a position in the Catholic church should be based on the individual merit of a candidate rather than how much wealth they have at their disposal.
1.7. Pro: Having democratic elections is the most fair way of selecting leaders.
1.7.1. Pro: The Church exists to serve the spiritual needs of its followers. They should do what helps their members feel closer to Christ.
1.7.1.1. Con: 'Doing what helps members feel closer to Christ' can look very different, \(and often contrary to one another,\) for different groups of Catholics. It is unlikely, if not impossible, that Church leaders, let alone Church followers, know how to compare and decide between these competing needs.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: For example, LGBTQ* Catholics may need Church acceptance in order to feel they can engage with their faith, which would require change from current Catholic norms. On the other hand, very orthodox Catholics may never be able to accept such a change. For them, a Church that is consistent in its beliefs that homosexuality is a sin against God is necessary to feel they can engage with their faith. The spiritual needs of these two groups would be mutually exclusive.
1.7.2. Con: Most voters vote in their self-interest, not in the interest of the organisation. This makes democratic elections inherently unfair due to the amount of biased input.
1.7.2.1. Con: The relation between the Church and its members is fundamentally different from the relation between a government and its citizens.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: A government exists to serve its citizens while the Church exists as an organized platform for worship, that allows followers to feel an increased connection to God.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: This means that citizens vote specifically in their own interests as the government exists to maximize that, while Church members would vote to improve how the Church operates, regardless of how they're personally affected.
1.7.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Church members may be unable to avoid voting in their own best interests rather than in the best interests of the Church. This idea, that humans cannot help but act based on self-interest, is called [psychological egoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_egoism).
1.7.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.
1.7.2.1.2. Con: Both Churches and governments exist to meet people's needs, just different needs.
1.7.2.1.3. Con: Certainly, that is why the church operates the way it does, introducing elections will be likening it to politics and nothing else.
1.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.6.3.1.
1.7.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.1.1.1.1.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.3.
1.8. Pro: The values of the Church are outdated. Having public elections would likely make the Church become more progressive and catch up with contemporary societal values.
1.8.1. Con: The Church would lose a lot of members if they feel like the Church is changing too much and too fast.
1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.8.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.
1.8.2. Con: The huge following of the Church even today indicates that most followers are happy with its value system.
1.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.3.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.8.7. Con: -> See 1.4.3.3.
1.9. Con: Church officials owe obligations to their religion first, and not followers.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.
1.9.2. Con: An organised religion cannot exist without followers. It is counter-intuitive to disregard the desires of followers when the church depends on them as it currently does.
1.9.2.1. Con: Followers don't make a religion, a religion makes followers. The Church has been existing for centuries, that is a true testimony.
1.9.3. Con: Pope Francis has said that priests should be [mediators between God and man](https://www.thecatholictelegraph.com/pope-francis-priests-should-be-shepherds-living-with-the-smell-of-the-sheep/13439), as that is their obligation to their flock.
1.9.4. Pro: The Church, in its mind, holds value solely because it reflects its understanding of God and faith, and so cannot do anything to stray from this.
