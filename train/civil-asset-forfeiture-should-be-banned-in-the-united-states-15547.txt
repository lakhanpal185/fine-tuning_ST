Discussion Title: Civil asset forfeiture should be banned in the United States.

1. Civil asset forfeiture should be banned in the United States.
1.1. Pro: Civil asset forfeiture constitutes theft.
1.1.1. Con: It does not legally constitute theft. Since theft is a crime, meaning it is against the law, what constitutes theft is determined by its legality.
1.1.2. Pro: There is no restitution process that is independently overseen, which means citizens whose property are unjustly seized have to take steps within the system that seized the property to try to get it back. That system almost invariably sides with itself out of self-preservation and out of corruption. This fosters further corruption in smaller municipalities and leaves individual citizens as a whole extremely vulnerable to corrupt law enforcement officials.
1.2. Pro: By allowing the very law enforcement organizations that perform civil seizures to share in the proceeds, corruption is all but guaranteed.
1.2.1. Con: The US is not very corrupted. Internationally it is perceived as the [18th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_the_United_States) least corrupt state.
1.2.1.1. Con: Its relative lack of corruption overall does not imply a complete lack of corruption. As an example, the UK, which ranks 10th on the same list, requires much more thorough proceedings before seizing assets.
1.2.1.2. Con: If laws can be passed so any form of corruption can be avoided, even the less serious ones, they should.
1.2.2. Pro: In 2014, law enforcement officers took [more property](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1b8b3618d880) from US citizens than burglars did.
1.2.2.1. Con: While CAF \(Civil asset forfeiture\) represented $5 billion and burglary $3.5 billion, if larceny and theft are included the numbers rise to [$12.3 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1b8b3618d880), way more than what law enforcement officers took.
1.2.2.2. Pro: These are federal numbers, so they don't even include property seized by state and local police. The Institute of Justice found that in 2013 the total for 14 states was [$250 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1b8b3618d880). The grand 50-state total would probably be much higher.
1.3. Pro: 100% should be banned. It is legalised theft. Your items should only be seized if it can be proven they are stolen or illegal.
1.4. Pro: Banning civil asset forfeiture would encourage law enforcement officers to pursue actual criminals, rather than people with valuable property.
1.4.1. Con: This assumes law enforcement officers are dishonest and persecute people in order to get their property, which may not be the case.
1.5. Con: Civil asset forfeiture is a valuable source of funding for law enforcement.
1.5.1. Pro: [Police](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/10/11/asset-seizures-fuel-police-spending/) agencies have used hundreds of millions of dollars thanks to federal civil forfeiture to buy guns, armored cars and electronic surveillance gear.
1.5.1.1. Pro: With tight budgets, using asset forfeiture dollars is useful for the police to purchase [equipment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2014/10/11/asset-seizures-fuel-police-spending/) and training to keep up with the ever-changing trends in crime ultimately helping serve and protect the citizens.
1.5.2. Con: If the process is not done correctly, and respecting people's rights, the fact that it is useful as a source of funding is irrelevant.
1.5.3. Con: Law enforcement should be funded by taxes and lawfully-applied fines.
1.6. Con: Property must be suspicious to be seized, so much of it is either involved with or proceeds of crime.
1.6.1. Con: In a country with rule of law and due process, being likely to have committed a crime or that law officials suspect one has committed a crime is not enough to be convicted. There is no reason why property should be treated differently.
1.6.2. Pro: Unfortunately this is not always the case. There are plenty examples of innocent people having items seizes and not getting them back
1.6.2.1. Con: Many policies can be abused or used incorrectly, that does not mean they are bad policies.
1.7. Con: Civil asset forfeiture takes money away from probable criminals.
1.7.1. Con: This is not a good thing if you believe in due process. Law enforcement should only punish convicted criminals, not suspects.
1.7.2. Con: But it also takes money away from completely innocent people due to unfair suspicion
1.7.3. Pro: Decreasing the cash flow and assets of criminals can be instrumental in bringing crime down.
1.8. Pro: The US Constitution guarantees a right to property, and civil asset forfeiture violates that right.
1.8.1. Con: This assumes the US constitution is the best possible rule set people can follow.
1.8.1.1. Con: Even if it is not the best possible rule set people can follow, the US Constitution is the rule set US citizens have decided is the best legal framework.
1.9. Con: Civil asset forfeiture is a tool for law enforcement to use against highly profitable criminal enterprises, especially violent drug cartels.
1.9.1. Con: One well known strategy law enforcement uses is to "follow the money". You can't follow the money if you simply take it.
1.9.1.1. Con: The money may be taken at the end of an investigation, and thus the money can be 'followed' up to that point.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: This is often not how the tool is used, however. Numerous small enforcement bodies in the United States have seized questionable assets from people who were ill-equipped to make the case that they were questionable. This is a threat to the general populace.
1.9.2. Con: The fact that as a tool civil asset forfeiture is useful fighting crime does not mean is ethically right.
1.9.3. Con: However, the program, unlike the criminal forfeiture, also targets citizens in [traffic stops](https://digitalcommons.lasalle.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1018&context=ecf_capstones) who are left defenseless if they want to get their money back.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Especially for low-income citizens, it may be too expensive for them to litigate to get their money back.
