Discussion Title: Monogamy vs Polygamy: Is the Norm of Monogamy Regrettable?

1. The norm of monogamy in society is regrettable.
1.1. Con: Non-monogamous relationships are more likely to face difficulties when it comes to navigating the legal aspects of a relationship.
1.1.1. Con: In the absence of social norms of monogamy, laws could be changed to give non-monogamous relationships easier access to legal status.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Significant portions of the world have legal types of polygamous marriage and legal systems which have grown accustomed to it.
1.1.2. Con: Non-monogamous relationships open up the possibility of more communitarian models of housing and family, where the burden of domestic tasks can be spread across a wider number of people.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Seeking out trusted helpers — cleaners, nannies etc — for domestic chores is difficult and represents a large sunk cost. In contrast dividing domestic duties amongst romantic partners is much easier as that trust already exists.
1.1.2.2. Pro: With a greater number of domestic residents the division of labour can be better distributed to allow people to perform to their comparative advantages in earning income, domestic tasks, child raising, etc.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: The division of tasks among multiple wives in a polygamous arrangement can be unequal, causing jealousy and conflict.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Non-monogamous relationships do not always entail more domestic residents in the household.
1.1.2.3. Con: Polygamous families are likely to create a [managerial hierarchy](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10570314.2016.1188327?journalCode=rwjc20) in order to coordinate domestic tasks.
1.1.3. Pro: [Around half](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/love-without-limits/201103/polyamory-and-children) of polyamorous people are parents. However, at least half of these attempt to hide their extramarital relationships from their children.
1.1.4. Pro: Although laws criminalizing polygamy are not always enforced, their existence causes consensually polygamous adults to live in constant fear.
1.1.4.1. Con: Many polyamorous people have dealt with this dilemma by simply marrying only one of their partners, which doesn't necessarily lessen the bond that they have with their other partners.
1.1.4.2. Pro: There are [laws against polygamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy_in_North_America#United_States) in all 50 states in the US.
1.1.5. Pro: Polyamorous households struggle to secure [health insurance](https://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/sister-wives/videos/health-insurance-and-spiritual-unions) for [all members](https://www.npr.org/books/titles/141717589/love-times-three-our-true-story-of-a-polygamous-marriage#excerpt) of the family, especially the secondary partner and their children.
1.2. Pro: Norms of monogamy disenfranchise marginalized groups in society.
1.2.1. Pro: Some religious minorities practice polygamy as a tenet of their faith, and discrimination against polygamy leads to discrimination against these religious groups.
1.2.1.1. Con: Polygamy, as practiced in these groups, contributes its own forms of discrimination: discrimination between first and second wife, between favorite and repudiated woman, between those who can afford many wives and those who cannot afford even one etc.
1.2.2. Pro: Accusations of polygamy have justified historic discrimination against "less civilized" ethnic groups.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Fears of "racial mixing" [justified](https://books.google.ca/books?id=jHc7AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=polygamy+and+racism&source=bl&ots=VonTGi9gkF&sig=G9tWB5K9DaJpQ5w4XHFlweNXokE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje2-T8yPbYAhXk34MKHTFmAqoQ6AEIWTAI#v=onepage&q=polygamy%20and%20racism&f=false) anti-polygamy movements in Latin America.
1.2.2.2. Con: This is at best a refutation of the excesses of normative monogamy, not normative monogamy itself.
1.2.2.3. Con: The underpinning cause of this discrimination is more likely rooted in racism, and merely enabled by the normative standards around monogamy.
1.2.3. Con: Most minority groups do not practice polygamy.
1.2.4. Pro: In many parts of the world, norms of monogamy reinforce norms against having multiple partners over a lifetime, making it difficult for women to leave abusive relationships or to remarry.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Many widows, divorcees and single mothers have a hard time finding a stable partner as they are deemed undesirable.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: According to the [UN Women](http://asiapacific.unwomen.org/en/news-and-events/stories/2014/12/widows-continue-to-face-severe-stigma-and-discrimination) organization, "There are an estimated 245 million widows worldwide, 115 million of whom live in poverty and suffer from social stigmatization and economic deprivation largely because they have lost their husbands."
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Widows [report](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/05/widows-women-bereavement-spouses) feelings of displacement and stigmatization, making it difficult to secure long-term financial stability or form new relationships.
1.2.4.1.3. Pro: A [Pew Research](https://www.npr.org/2011/02/24/134031175/For-Single-Mothers-Stigma-Difficult-To-Shake) poll found that 70% of Americans believe that single women raising children is bad for society.
1.2.5. Con: This assumes that the existence of a norm implies that other alternatives are disallowed, which is false.
1.2.5.1. Con: Norms, by their nature, dissuade and stigmatize non-normative behavior.
1.2.6. Pro: Individuals of high social strata are more likely to have multiple wives. This leaves less single partners for everyone else in society, especially those who are disadvantaged, young, or poor.
1.2.7. Pro: Norms of monogomy are heavily interwoven with Western, ethnocentric norms for what a family or marriage should look like. These are based upon values which other societies and cultures do not necessarily share.
1.2.7.1. Con: Even when other cultures \([chinese](http://factsanddetails.com/china/cat4/sub20/item108.html#chapter-1), [muslim](https://www.theguardian.com/world/belief/2008/nov/21/islam-polygamy-do-not-want) etc...\) tolerate polygamy, polygamy is not the norm but the minority option.
1.2.7.2. Con: This assumes we should automatically respect foreign cultural customs when we would not make the same argument with child marriage or genital mutilation.
1.2.8. Pro: Non-monogamous families would create a diverse generation capable of wide spread acceptance.
1.2.8.1. Con: Non-monogamous families could just as easily create a generation capable of widespread prejudice.
1.3. Con: Normalising non-monogamous relationships makes it more likely that relationships with harmful gender dynamics will occur and contribute to wider societal problems.
1.3.1. Pro: While advocates of non-monogamy in popular culture promote it as an aspect of sexual liberation, many conservative religions use formal or informal polygamy as a means of sexual repression and control.
1.3.1.1. Pro: [Some forms of Islam use marriage as a forced conversion tool](https://www.onenewsnow.com/persecution/2017/10/15/muslims-abduct-egyptian-christians-force-to-marry-convert) for christian women, helped by the possibility of polygamy.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Children raised in fundamentalist Mormonism [must choose](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2007/11/02/november-2-2007-children-of-polygamists/4509/) between participating in polygamy or being kicked out of their communities and rejected by their families.
1.3.1.3. Con: Those religions will continue to practice monogamy as they exist within communities with very specific and different norms. To the extent non-monogamy is normalised in wider society this is likely to not affect them.
1.3.2. Pro: To the extent men have, on average, greater economic and social capital in society a norm that better allows them to have multiple relationships or marriages will lead to more skewed power dynamics and sex ratios in marriage/dating pools.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Polygamous marriage around the world is almost exclusively practiced by men [\(387\)](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1371&context=bjil).
1.3.3. Con: Not all non-monogamous relations will involve more women than men.
1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.3.5. Pro: A 2012 study from the University of British Columbia [shows](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120124093142.htm) that, in polygamist cultures, "the intra-sexual competition that occurs causes greater levels of crime, violence, poverty and gender inequality than in societies that institutionalize and practice monogamous marriage."
1.3.6. Pro: The 'erotic capital' of young women [is higher than the equivalent within young men](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/19/honey-money-catherine-hakim-review); meaning that their desirability as partners is much greater. Non-monogamy better enables men to widen the 'sex gap' that advances their sexual interests.
1.3.6.1. Pro: "[While young women may possess considerable charms, men’s desire for them always vastly outstrips supply. The reverse is simply not the case: men are both less attractive to women, and markedly less desired by them, especially as those women grow older. What Hakim terms “the male sex-deficit” underlies both the ubiquity of female sexual imagery – as pornography, as marketing adjunct – and the persistent unwillingness of society at large to “valorise” women’s good looks](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/19/honey-money-catherine-hakim-review)."
1.3.6.2. Con: Given this disjunct in erotic capital monogamy actually serves the interests of men over women as it better allows even the "[least attractive/wealthy/powerful men gain at least one sexual partner](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/19/honey-money-catherine-hakim-review)" whereas non-monogamy would better allow women to leverage what power they do have to pursue better partners.
1.3.7. Pro: There is an [association](https://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21732695-plural-marriage-bred-inequality-begets-violence-link-between-polygamy-and-war) between polygamy, and the inequality it highlights, and violence or war.
1.3.8. Con: Normalizing non-monogamy will mean that it will gain more public support and accrue less stigma, making it more likely that any problematic dynamics will be solved.
1.3.8.1. Pro: When non-monogamy is less stigmatized, women are more likely to report abuse in their non-monogamous relationships.
1.4. Pro: Non-monogamous relationships can better satisfy people's relationship-related needs.
1.4.1. Pro: The ideal of monogamy is built around the idea of there being a perfect partner out there for everyone, but people may struggle to find a partner who fulfils all their needs.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Non-monogamous relationships allow a person to maintain a relationship with a primary partner, while also exploring positive relationships outside it which may fulfil other needs.
1.4.1.2. Con: Monogamous relationships are compatible with recognizing the need to constantly work on a relationship.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Monogamy constitutes an unrealistic expectation from an individual.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Huge numbers of individuals cheat on their partners in the status quo.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: This doesn't prove the unrealistic status of monogamy. We can also say that huge number of individuals stay faithful to their partner.
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: The human body is complex and has multiple needs. The human mind is no different. It is highly unlikely that one partner can provide all the things that a person needs in order to be fulfilled and happy.
1.4.1.4. Con: The only strict 'need' that non-monogamy offers are sexual; any other aspects of a relationship that people desire can be explored through close friendships.
1.4.1.5. Con: Monogamy does not presuppose a perfect partner. [In fact, the idea of a "soulmate" is really recent in the history of marriage/couples](https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200505/marriage-history)
1.4.1.6. Con: Not all \(sufficiently\) satisfying relationships need to be perfect, meaning that finding the perfect partner is not intrinsic to monogamy.
1.4.2. Pro: People have diverse needs in relationships. One partner may not be able to satisfy all of those needs, so having multiple partners allows people to find more satisfaction in their relationships.
1.4.2.1. Pro: People may want their partners to satisfy sexual, emotional, intellectual, and other needs. It is unlikely that one person can effectively satisfy all of these needs, so picking a diverse range of partners allows different needs to be satisfied.
1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.4.
1.4.3. Con: There are many relationship-related needs which non-monogamous relationships cannot satisfy.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Since non-monogamous relationships are more transitory and the attention of participants is divided between more people, non-monogamous relationships cannot satisfy the need for long-term deep commitment.
1.4.3.2. Con: Non-monogamous relationships can imitate the qualities of monogamous relationships \(for example, by having one primary partner\), but still bring the benefits of various secondary partners.
1.4.4. Con: Many people need a sense of trust in their closest partner, which would be undermined if that partner was engaging in other relationships of a similar nature.
1.4.4.1. Con: We are not suggesting a ban on monogamy. People who need that sense of trust could still chose a monogamous partner, even in the case that this is no longer the norm.
1.4.4.2. Con: Being non-monogamous doesn't mean that you can't have a sense of trust in your closest partner. Non-monogamous couples can be honest about their needs and other relationships
1.4.4.3. Pro: The most satisfying and deepest human emotions are experienced under conditions of emotional safety and security.
1.4.5. Pro: Single people would more easily find a partner because everyone would become potential partners, including those already in a relationship.
1.4.5.1. Con: It is not necessarily true that removing a norm of monogamy would drastically increase the number of people who practice non-monogamy. Therefore, it may not drastically increase the number of available partners.
1.4.5.2. Con: Normalizing non-monogamy makes it appropriate to approach anyone’s partner for sex or relationship and increases advances into monogamous relationships.
1.4.5.3. Con: Just because someone is in a non-monogamous relationship does not make them a potential partner for everyone.
1.4.6. Con: Non-monogamy introduces an element of uncertaintly about one’s place or value.
1.4.7. Con: When multiple partners can have multiple partners there is the possibility of exponential overlap. This creates a complex and unstable web of interconnected sexual/emotional relationships.
1.4.8. Con: Nonmonogamy limits the time and attention that can be focused on the needs of any one romantic relationship.
1.5. Pro: The ingrained norm of monogamy means that people who practice non-monogamous relationships often face discrimination and social stigma.
1.5.1. Con: A norm of monogamy can coexist with tolerance for non-monogamous relationships, which could be seen as acceptable deviations from a social norm. It is therefore possible to oppose discrimination against people in non-monogamous relationships while also supporting the norm of monogamy.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Society has various norms which govern relationships - for example, some societies have a norm that people only marry after dating for multiple years. This does not mean that people who deviate from the norm are discriminated against in any substantive way, but just that they are seen as somewhat abnormal.
1.5.1.2. Con: Societal norms necessitate serious stigma upon those that violate them. This is especially true in the instance of monogamy.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Individuals who choose to try polyamory are often slut shamed or ridiculed in other ways.
1.5.2. Con: Social stigma is something that limits certain behaviours, such as cannibalism. Statistical proof that someone is experiencing stigma for a given behaviour is not proof that the behaviour is being unfairly stigmatized.
1.5.3. Con: Social stigma is justified when it discourages relationships that \(in general\) have harmful effects — such as those where there are large differences in power or maturity.
1.5.3.1. Con: If large gaps in power or maturity are a problem, those are the relationships that should be frowned upon, whether they're monogamous or poly.
1.5.3.2. Con: Gaps in power and maturity are more harmful in monogamous relationships, since the less powerful or mature person is wholly dependent on the other.
1.5.4. Pro: Studies [show](http://withdrawing from mainstream society) people in polygamous relationships have developed multiple distinct "communicative strategies for coping with this stigma," including "withdrawing from mainstream society," indicating the significance of the cultural disapproval they face.
1.5.5. Pro: According to a 2015 YouGov study, around half of adults in the US \(56%\) and the UK \(47%\) believe polyamorous relationships are "morally wrong."
1.5.6. Pro: In a study [comparing](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/102091/asap1286.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) the description of a monogamous couple to an otherwise identical non-monogamous couple, participants rated the non-monogamous couple as worse in every way, from qualities such as "loves one another" and "caring people" to "likely to volunteer" and "likely to tip well."
1.5.7. Pro: In a [survey](http://www.lovemore.com/polyamory-articles/2012-lovingmore-polyamory-survey/) of 4,000 self-reported non-monogamous persons, 28.5% said they experienced discrimination in the past ten years \(compared to the general population, at 5.5%\).
1.5.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.6. Pro: Monogamy is a social construct that restricts human nature, therefore it should not be a permanent norm.
1.6.1. Con: Human nature can wildly differ over different environments and psychological states.
1.6.2. Con: Since most of civilizations, living or dead, practiced monogamy, it's probably not a social construct. It's more likely that polygamous societies were outliers \(see the appendix of [The Abolition of Man](https://archive.org/stream/TheAbolitionOfMan_229/C.s.Lewis-TheAbolitionOfMan_djvu.txt) section 5.a\).
1.6.2.1. Con: Primates have polygamous relationships. As descendants it seems to be a more natural behavior and the idea of monogamy could be a socio-political construct to reduce conflict about ecomonic posessions and the need for ordered heritage. This function could be replaced by other means.
1.6.3. Pro: According to [anthropological studies](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/science/monogamys-boost-to-human-evolution.html), only a fifth of human cultures are strictly monogamous.
1.6.3.1. Con: In the article linked, it is written: "The vast majority of human societies embrace a mix of marriage types, with some people practicing monogamy and others polygamy. \(Most people in these cultures are in monogamous marriages, though.\)" This confirms that monogamy is a norm and the other models a social construct.
1.6.4. Pro: There's nothing wrong with monogamy per se. For those that desire it, it's fantastic. However, it is far from the broad based norm that society would have us believe and there are at least as many who would prefer a non monogamous relationship. The problem comes when monogamy is taught to be the only "real" way to live in a relationship and everyone who has no desire for it must be a sexual deviant or have something wrong with them.
1.6.4.1. Con: If at least as many people preferred nonmonogamy as preferred monogamy, then monogamy would not be the norm.  One relationship style being a cultural norm doesn't have to imply anything at all about the acceptability of other styles.
1.6.4.2. Con: There's nothing wrong with either type of relationship necessarily, but there's also nothing wrong with there being a default expectation.
1.6.5. Pro: There is no “perfect type of relationship”. Different types of people will find satisfaction in different types of relationships. We should not teach people that monogamy is the only way to find fulfillment. Instead, we should teach them to search for the type of relationship that makes them the happiest.
1.6.6. Pro: Monogamy is like taxes and the speed limit: we say we support it but most of us eventually break it on some level. At best, most people practice serial monogamy. Polyamory would allow us to forego this farce and admit that we can have multiple attractions; maintain multiple relationships; and reinforce that no one "owns" anyone else or anyone else's sexuality.
1.6.7. Pro: Everyone should be able to love and be with whom they please as long as it is consensual.
1.6.8. Pro: Humans are [not](https://www.livescience.com/49690-humans-naturally-monogamous-promiscuous.html) naturally monogamous.
1.6.8.1. Con: If evolution granted monogamy a competitive advantage, then over time it's psychological impacts would predispose humans to monogamy.
1.6.9. Pro: Only [3-5%](https://www.livescience.com/32146-are-humans-meant-to-be-monogamous.html) of mammal species \(including humans\) have been observed to form monogamous relationships.
1.6.9.1. Con: Infanticide is also common in the animal kingdom. We do not base morality on animal behaviour.
1.6.9.2. Con: The fact that monogamy is unnatural for most species does not mean that it is unnatural for humans.
1.6.9.3. Pro: Basic human psychology is developed through evolution.
1.6.10. Con: Social constructs dictate how human beings live and interact with each other in all walks of life - partnerships and marriage are not any different.
1.6.11. Con: The fact that something is a social construct and restricts human nature is not necessarily a bad thing, if it restricts human nature in desirable ways. Social constructs are important as they help maintain societal order and stability.
1.6.11.1. Pro: There are countless social constructs that limit human behavior; the most common is morality. These constructs are important and necessary.
1.7. Pro: The institution of monogamy reinforces gender roles within relationships more than non-monogamous relationships.
1.7.1. Pro: Non-monogamy destabilises the traditionally gender binary and how it corresponds to domestic roles in heterosexual relationships — if only because there are now more than one person of each gender involved in the relationship.
1.7.1.1. Pro: When roles are divided over a larger number of people with varying mixes of genders, there is no capacity for a standard allocation of roles to develop and become entrenched as a stereotype.
1.7.2. Pro: Even if some gender roles persist, non-monogamous relationships mitigate the worst harms of those roles.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Gender norms mean that women who have children are expected to care for them, and are therefore cut off from pursuing their careers. If there are multiple women in a non-monogamous relationship, dividing up the role of childcare allows all of them to continue to pursue other goals.
1.7.3. Pro: Women have more bargaining power within non-monogamous relationships, and therefore have a greater capacity to object to or refuse to conform to traditional gender norms.
1.7.3.1. Pro: In a world with non-monogamous relationships, entry and exit into relationships is less costly because relationships are more fluid. This allows women to threaten to leave or to actually leave relationships which they feel unduly push them into traditional gender roles.
1.7.3.2. Con: The same reasons that women have more bargaining power within non-monogamous relationships also mean that men have more bargaining power within non-monogamous relationships, so the relative power imbalance remains the same.
1.7.4. Con: Gender norms are becoming looser as a result of other societal changes such as women and men competing more equally in the workplace.
1.7.4.1. Pro: In recent years, gender roles in marriage have exerted less influence. A larger share of men in 2007, compared with their 1970 counterparts, are married to women whose education and income exceed their own, according to the [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/01/19/women-men-and-the-new-economics-of-marriage/).
1.7.5. Con: There is still a [male-centric politic](https://jezebel.com/5339211/is-non-monogamy-a-feminist-relationship-choice) involved in most poly and non monogamous relationships.
1.7.6. Con: Traditional gender roles are not bad by default. Things that promote them are also not bad by default. Traditional roles are a legitimate choice.
1.7.7. Con: The fact that there is a term for — and noted shortage of —  'unicorns' \(bisexual women interested in sleeping with a man-woman couple\) but seemingly no equivalent term or demand for the male counterpart suggests non-monogamy focuses on satisfying the sexual desires of heterosexual men.
1.7.8. Con: [Famous](https://www.npr.org/books/titles/141717589/love-times-three-our-true-story-of-a-polygamous-marriage#excerpt) polygamist households in the media often follow traditional gender roles for the division of labor.
1.7.9. Pro: For married couples, [role specialization](https://academic.oup.com/sw/article-abstract/31/6/457/1925047) exists in most households, in accordance with traditional sex role norms.
1.8. Pro: Societal norms and expectations around monogamous relationships mean people are more likely to remain in unsatisfying relationships.
1.8.1. Con: The norm of monogamy means partners are more likely to focus on improving their current relationship, rather than simply turning to other partners.
1.8.1.1. Con: If turning to different partners is a more efficient way of improving a person's relationship status than working on their current relationship, there is nothing bad about people doing that.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.8.3. Con: Serial monogamy is practiced in many cultures today and normalizes leaving unsuitable partners.
1.8.4. Con: If one partner is unsatisfied in a relationship exploring non-monogomy enables them to not explicitly address the issues in that relationship.
1.8.4.1. Con: Exploring non-monogamy can often destroy the mutual trust in a relationship.
1.8.5. Pro: People are often [shamed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201304/the-lingering-psychological-effects-multiple-sex-partners) \(as "easy," promiscuous, or worse\) for having multiple partners over the course of their life, which can deter them from seeking new relationships.
1.9. Con: Growing up in the context of a non-monogamous relationship disadvantages children.
1.9.1. Pro: "We know that kids thrive on stable routines with stable caregivers,” [said](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/multiple-lovers-no-jealousy/374697/) W. Bradford Wilcox, a sociologist and the director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. Polyamory can be like a “marriage-go-round,” Wilcox said. “When kids are exposed to a revolving carousel of spouses, that experience of instability and transition can be traumatic.”
1.9.1.1. Con: While stability is important to children, polygamous households are not necessarily less stable than monogamous households.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: Many monogamous relationships do not involve these benefits, as [40-50%](http://www.apa.org/topics/divorce/) of all marriages in the US end in divorce.
1.9.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no evidence that a norm of non-monogamy would reduce divorce rates.
1.9.1.1.2. Pro: Non-monogamous households can still have a primary caregiver, giving the child a significant degree of stability.
1.9.1.2. Con: Polyamory is not promiscuity. Most non-monogamous relationships do have a stable caregiver \(or even multiple stable caregivers\).
1.9.2. Con: In communities where parents have a high mortality or divorce rate, having multiple caregivers can actually help to stabilize family situations for children.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Many parents have unpredictable work schedules. In light of the shift in society from set work times to work on demand schedules among hourly workers, a communal family approach seems beneficial to children.
1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.9.1.1.1.
1.9.4. Con: Frankly, unless the relationship is poly \(and all partners live together\) why would the children even know the sexual proclivities of their parents? What business is it of theirs in the first place? Parents have an identity separate from their children.
1.9.5. Con: Members of polygamous communities \(in Jordan\) report that they have [strong family bonds](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41604468?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) and support.
1.9.6. Pro: [Statistically](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13229400.2015.1086405), children are worse off coming from a polygamous background than those raised in 2 parent households.
1.9.6.1. Con: The types of people who select into non-monogamous relationships are most likely different in many ways from the wider population, so statistical differences in outcomes between the children of monogamous and non-monogamous parents is not evidence of a negative causal impact of non-monogamy on children.
1.9.6.2. Con: ["Although polygynous family structures appear to have detrimental effects on children and adolescents, the mediating effects of parental education, economy and family functioning need to be investigated."](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13229400.2015.1086405)
1.9.6.3. Pro: Children raised in polygamous families tend to be [worse](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/84542/1/WRAP_%253A10.1007%252Fs11150-016-9353-x.pdf) [off](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020925123016) than those raised in two-parent households.
1.9.6.4. Pro: Children raised in polygamous families have [worse psychological outcomes](http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/19573/7/19573%20AlSharfi%20Pfeffer%20Miller%202015.pdf).
1.9.7. Pro: Monogamous marriage, compared to a polygamous culture, results in significant improvements in child welfare, including lower rates of child neglect, abuse, accidental death, homicide and intra-household conflict, a [2012 UBC study](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-01/uobc-mrm012312.php) found.
1.9.7.1. Con: The study referenced compares monogamy with polygyny. This is not representative of polygamy in general and is linked to a sexist culture.
1.9.7.2. Con: -> See 1.9.6.1.
1.10. Con: Monogamous relationships are often very satisfying and provide both partners with security, trust, and intimacy.
1.10.1. Pro: Monogamous relationships force a couple to actually commit to one another because there are no alternatives.
1.10.1.1. Con: Many couples may feel "trapped" by monogamy, even if they would be unwilling to break up.
1.10.1.2. Con: When couples have space to express their anxieties outside the relationship, they can feel comfortable building their relationship.
1.10.1.3. Con: There being no other alternatives can create a stifling environment not conductive to a healthy and satisfying relationships.
1.10.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.
1.10.1.5. Con: Relationships that exist only because of a lack of other options do not cultivate trust or other relational benefits.
1.10.2. Con: -> See 1.9.1.1.1.
1.10.3. Con: Many polyamorous relationships provide these same benefits, and are actually often more satisfying since polyamorous people are typically better at dealing with [feelings of jealousy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201312/jealousy-and-compersion-multiple-partners-1) \(and often don't experience jealousy at all\).
1.10.3.1. Pro: Due to stigma, those who currently engage in polyamory are those also capable of handling the jealousy.
1.10.4. Con: If monogamous relationships are genuinely better, then people will opt into them regardless of whether they are the social norm or not.
1.10.5. Con: -> See 1.4.3.2.
1.10.6. Pro: Our emotional energy is limited, and monogamy focuses this limited energy into one sexual partner, and any offspring they produce together. The more physical a relationship is, and the more sexual partners a person has, the less connection occurs. As a result, polygamy increases depression due to loneliness and emotional isolation.
1.10.7. Pro: It is easier to provide the time and emotional support needed in a relationship when you are dedicated to only one person.
1.10.7.1. Pro: Relationships require quite a lot of communication and time, which is more difficult to share across multiple partners.
1.10.7.1.1. Pro: This increases the chance of miscommunication about boundaries or comfort which can lead to infidelity.
1.10.7.2. Con: Polyamorous relationships require participants to actively define their goals, instead of relying on social norms, and thus create communication.
1.11. Con: The fact that monogamy is a social standard is reasonable because a pairing of two people is the basic form of relationship. Polygamy could easily be choosen as a variant without considering the norm of monogamy regrettable.
1.11.1. Pro: It's possible more than one option exists for "the good life".
1.11.1.1. Con: Individuals construct their own subjective versions of the good life but they may find that societally constructed norms aide in their creation.
1.11.2. Pro: Norms allow people to develop their identities, even if those identities operate in contradiction to norms.
1.11.2.1. Pro: Norms help people frame, and thus understand, their relationship goals and ideals.
1.11.2.2. Con: Even if norms in general are good, that does not mean we must value a norm of monogamy.
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.5.
1.11.4. Con: There is no reason to believe that a relationship between two people is the "basic" form of relationship.
1.11.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.
1.12. Pro: Non-monogamous relationships can be more successful and fulfilling than monogamous ones.
1.12.1. Con: Non-monogamous relationships can [result](http://anthro.vancouver.wsu.edu/media/Course_files/anth-395-nicole-hess/jankowiak-polygyny.pdf) in jealousy and deep-seated feelings of angst that arise over competing for access to a mutual partner.
1.12.1.1. Con: This study was based on predominantly African cultures where men take several wives, not the more egalitarian non-monogamous community in more developed nations.
1.12.1.2. Con: People who know they will likely be jealous are still likely to choose monogamous relationships, even if monogamy is not a norm.
1.12.1.3. Pro: Basic [sleeping arrangements](https://vanwinkles.com/what-are-the-sleeping-arrangements-like-for-polygamists) can lead to conflict and jealousy in a non-monogamous household.
1.12.1.4. Con: The same goes for monogamous relationships, which can contain just as much jealousy — usually the result of paying more attention to someone or something else than one's partner. Jealousy is a mutual characteristic and therefore a moot point.
1.12.2. Pro: Recognizing the possibility of choosing non-monogamous relationships could avoid the problems of infidelity within the couples.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Partners don't feel the need to go behind one another's back when they can communicate and talk about their desire to sleep with another person.
1.12.2.2. Con: -> See 1.10.7.1.
1.12.2.3. Con: Non-monogamy doesn't need to be the new norm for couples to be able to recognize the possibility of trying it.
1.12.3. Pro: Between the fact that half of marriages end in divorce, and that relationships that end in marriage are generally better than those that don't, there is significant evidence that the current standards of relationships aren't ideal.
1.12.4. Pro: Monogamy is about "owning" another person's desires — your partner sacrifices their needs for you, to show you their love. But should true love not be about empowering your partner, supporting your partner being their best self, and encouraging them to learn more about themselves?
1.12.4.1. Con: There are lots of ways to learn about yourself without having sex with new people and having sex with other people is not a need.
1.12.4.2. Con: Primary partners undermine their attachment to each other with secondary partners. Secondary partners never get the full benefit of being a primary partner unless they bump the other primary partner.
1.12.4.3. Con: The “best self” of you or your partner may be found in fidelity. Our worst self may be found in conditions of undermined primary attachments.
1.12.4.4. Con: Monogamy is not about owning another person's desires, any more than non-monagamy is about ignoring everyone else's needs.
1.12.5. Pro: The average fertility rate in many countries is now under 2.1 child per women, which is the estimated fertility required for natural [population replacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility). If polygamy was the norm, women could have children with each of their partners, so it would help to [increase the average fertility](http://www.theindependent.sg/some-polygamy-may-arrest-falling-birth-rates/) back to a sustainable level.
1.12.5.1. Con: One women can have 10 babies with 10 men in 10 years. 9 of these men have to wait 1 to 9 years to reproduce with her. If they reproduce with another women while they wait then their resources and time go to those children and they move on.
1.12.5.2. Con: Men can have hundreds of babies in a year if they find enough women. There is no way he can support the number of children he could produce.
1.12.5.3. Con: People have limits on their time and resources. Reproducing with multiple partners who may also be reproducing with multiple partners will exceed these limits quickly.
1.12.6. Con: Partnerships that include more than two people are inherently unstable, especially if all are in relationships with each other. It only takes one soured connection to tumble the stack.
1.12.7. Con: The emotional complexity of multiple partners who each might have multiple partners becomes dissatisfying very quickly.
1.12.8. Con: Nonmonogamous relationships can be as successful and fulfilling as monogamous ones, but there is nothing to suggest that they have more potential to be successful or fulfilling than monogamous relationships.
1.12.9. Pro: People in non-monogamous relationships often [develop](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/multiple-lovers-no-jealousy/374697/) strong systems of communication and trust, avoiding jealousy.
1.12.9.1. Con: -> See 1.12.1.3.
1.12.9.2. Pro: Open discussion \(and action\) around extra relationship sex builds very deep trust. Ignoring and suppressing those urges builds resentment and often secrecy/trust breaking acts.
1.12.10. Con: Even if this may be true in some cases, it does not necessarily constitute a trend sufficient to justify replacing the norm of monogamy.
1.12.11. Pro: There are [documented instances](https://www.npr.org/2011/10/26/141729499/one-husband-three-wives-love-and-polygamy) of polygamous marriages being loving and fulfilling.
1.12.11.1. Con: Either nonmonogamous or monogmaous relationships can be loving and fulfilling.  This does not mean that nonmonogamous relationships are inherently more fulfilling.
1.12.12. Con: There may not be adequate data to justify whether these relationships are fulfilling or not, and to what extent they are fulfilling owing to the social stigma attached to such relationships.
1.13. Con: Navigating non-monogamous relationships can be extremely difficult for some people, so a norm of monogamy is beneficial for them.
1.13.1. Con: Like marriage, or one-night stands, non-monogamy is an option not a requirement. People should consciously choose the kind of relationship that best suits their character.
1.13.2. Pro: A norm of monogamy means that non-monogamy needs to be carefully negotiated rather than being assumed.
1.13.2.1. Pro: This need for explicit discussion often leads to better communication than couples who rely on assumptions.
1.13.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.9.
1.13.3. Pro: If non-monogamy is assumed to be the norm then people can be thrown into a challenging situation without full consent.
1.13.4. Con: Navigating monogamous relationships is clearly difficult for many people, given the fact that [40-50%](http://www.apa.org/topics/divorce/) of marriages in the US end in divorce.
1.13.4.1. Con: Relationships don't have to be forever to be successful, and a divorce doesn't necessarily indicate that people are unable to navigate relationships.
