Discussion Title: The US should support EU policy to admit more refugees

1. The US should support EU policy to admit more refugees
1.1. Pro: With declining birth rates, the EU is on course to face population issues. Admitting more refugees would alleviate this problem. Due to US economic ties, it is within its economic interests to avoid such issues.
1.1.1. Pro: Declining birth rates have the potential to threaten economic stability and growth of EU countries [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/baby-crisis-europe-brink-depopulation-disaster). Issues surrounding social security programs, work force population, etc. could be addressed by admitting and integrating more refugees.
1.1.2. Con: Tension over national identity \(manifested in the rise of nationalism in Europe\) will be exacerbated by admitting more refugees. [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4894286/)
1.1.3. Con: With declining birth rates, the EU \(really, the Western world\) should consider what legal policies \(e.g. legalized abortion\) and cultural norms \(e.g. emphasis on government vs. family reliance\) should be addressed to reverse that decline, thus increasing their birth rates and allowing more sovereign citizens stability in their nations.
1.2. Pro: The international community has a humanitarian obligation to refugees. The US should encourage its European allies to fulfill this obligation.
1.2.1. Pro: According to the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, refugees have the right to seek asylum from persecution "for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion."

1.2.2. Con: Some EU countries are more impacted by refugee migration than others; there is currently no system to spread the burden. [theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/germany-merkel-refugee-asylum/405058/)
1.3. Con: Admitting refugees from politically unstable/violent regions of the world poses a security risk to the EU. The US should not support policies that could endanger its allies in Europeâ€”this could potentially affect US security in the long term.
1.3.1. Pro: Germany saw an increase in violent crime between 2015 and 2016. A study attributes 90% of these crimes to refugees, but notes that refugees fleeing war were less likely to commit crimes. [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-crime/violent-crime-rises-in-germany-and-is-attributed-to-refugees-idUSKBN1ES16J)
1.3.1.1. Con: A slight increase in the crime rate is not a matter of national security.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: According to the BKA \(the German police\), crime went up slightly in 2015, but stayed below the 2005 numbers, and has declined since.

1.3.1.2. Con: The study attributes the rise in crime to males 14-30 years old, the most likely demographic to commit crimes regardless of national origin or refugee status. [bbc.com](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42557828)
1.3.2. Con: Studies in Sweden have shown that Swedish citizens are more likely to commit crimes than migrants; crime rates are more dependent on citizens'/migrants' socioeconomic status than origin country.

1.4. Con: Admitting more refugees can have adverse effects on host economies. US economic interests in Europe could subsequently be negatively impacted.
1.4.1. Pro: Admitting more refugees could increase the population of low skilled laborers. By the logic of the Stopler-Samuelson theorem, this would drive wages down for citizens of the host country.
1.4.2. Con: Approximately half of the jobs available to workers in Europe can be automated [mckinsey.com](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Global%20Themes/Europe/Ten%20imperatives%20for%20Europe%20in%20the%20age%20of%20AI%20and%20automation/Digitization-AI-and-the-future-of-work.ashx). Since technological advancement has greater potential for job displacement than refugee migration, policy makers should be wary of citing economic reasons against expanding refugee intake.
