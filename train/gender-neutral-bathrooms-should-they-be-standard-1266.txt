Discussion Title: Gender Neutral Bathrooms: Should They be Standard?

1. No public restrooms of any sort should be separated by either sex or gender.
1.1. Con: Men and women, because of their different biological characteristics, each need a different type of bathroom. Gender-segregated bathrooms reflect and honour these differences.
1.1.1. Pro: Gender segregated restrooms are optimized for the needs of each sex: there are urinals for men, and sanitary bins for the disposal of female sanitary waste for women.
1.1.1.1. Con: Most men don't have urinals in their homes rather than toilets. It follows that if all people can use toilets for all of their bathroom needs, then there is no need at all for urinals. All stalls or rooms having low-flow toilets and a waste bin solves this.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Urinals take up less space, and are therefore more efficient.
1.1.1.2. Con: Urinals designed for vaginas exist, but are not widespread outside of certain cultures. For sanitary bins, some men \(namely transsexual men\) do indeed menstruate and thus benefit from them. There is no reason gender neutral facilities can't be built with both urinals and bins.
1.1.1.3. Con: Those optimizations can easily be included in unisex bathroomsÂ as well.
1.1.2. Pro: We observe this logic elsewhere where it seems beneficial, too, for example in the gender-segregation in sports, whether it concerns team segregation or record segregation.
1.1.2.1. Pro: In many sports, the physical differences of men and women shape results. For example, men can run marathons faster than women, which is visible in the [world records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_world_record_progression) as well as events open to amateurs, such as the [London Marathon](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/athletics/london-marathon-average-best-finishing-7808588).
1.1.2.2. Con: As there is a difference in innate ability in the case of sports, it is not discriminatory to segregate based on gender in that narrow instance, since the difference is solely as a result of differing natural qualities. This does not apply in the case of unisex bathrooms.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: We do not consider it discriminatory for a restaurant such as [Hooters to refuse to employ male individuals as waiters](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-can-hooters-hire-only-women-2015-9). In this case, the separation is based on qualification.
1.1.3. Con: Men and women may be different biologically, but it is not necessary to have a different room in which to go to the toilet to honour that: providing both urinals and toilets in one room would surely suffice.
1.1.4. Pro: The separation of bathrooms across genders highlights the narrative of the separation of man and woman. Whilst some people may not like this, others, generally cis heterosexual individuals, find it beneficial to their psychosexual wellbeing.
1.1.5. Con: Stalls can be used by everyone, physical differences do not stop this.
1.1.6. Con: Transsexual people have no biological issue using either rooms \(going from one to the other\). Biological differences are not significant enough to support segregation.
1.1.7. Con: Men and women are different by gender, not necessarily by sex.
1.1.7.1. Pro: What gender a person presents as does not necessarily correlate with their biological characteristics. For example, [men who menstruate](https://www.thedailybeast.com/yes-men-can-have-periods-and-we-need-to-talk-about-them), and women who have a penis can use the same facilities.
1.1.8. Con: We all use the same toilets at home with absolutely no issue whatsoever. The toilets in the men's room are the same as those in the women's room.
1.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.8.2. Pro: The toilets can easily be seen today to be the same, and historically too, both men and women used to urinate and defecate in the open, where there were no differences in the defecal landscape.
1.1.8.3. Con: We don't usually all use the same facilities at home at the same time.
1.1.8.4. Con: Restrooms at home guarantee a measure of privacy and security as only a handful of individuals at most have access to them, none of whom are usually strangers.
1.1.8.5. Con: Some homes have two washrooms and each are dedicated to "his or hers" depending on preferences and agreements. \([example 1](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11081251/His-n-hers-bathrooms-the-key-to-a-happy-marriage.html), [example 2](https://www.angieslist.com/articles/separate-bathrooms-him-and-her.htm)\)
1.1.8.5.1. Con: The overwhelming majority don't, to the point where if whether a home didn't have 'his' and 'hers' restrooms was somehow the lone deciding factor in a criminal case, it would be beyond a reasonable doubt to assume they didn't, and secure a conviction.
1.1.8.5.1.1. Con: Some do.
1.1.8.6. Con: Having a known person of the opposite sex using the same facilities at home is different than having a stranger of the opposite sex using the same facilities.
1.1.8.6.1. Con: Having a ring finger is different than having an index finger, a fact that has exactly as much bearing as the parent statement does on this argument.
1.1.8.6.2. Con: We all use the same portapoties..
1.2. Con: Mandating the form of public bathrooms represents government overreach.
1.2.1. Pro: There is no "bathroom tax" as far as I know. To say that the price of goods would go up due to unisex bathrooms is unfounded.
1.2.2. Con: The free market is very good at distrusting resources in an optimum, but amoral manner. Relying on the free market to solve moral issues is trusting the fox to guard the hen house.
1.2.2.1. Con: Amoral is not immoral.  The market will move where the people dictate.  If the people are ready for this change the market will accommodate.  If not, the market will wait.
1.2.3. Pro: The local policy approach would also allow microcosms of application that could be analyzed for effect before other localities adopted.
1.2.4. Con: The free market did not solve slavery, woman's suffrage, countless workers rights issues, countless consumer rights issues, the issue of monopolies, concentration of wealth, the securing of private information, countless owners rights issues, countless seller rights issues, abuse of minorities, abuse of ignorance, abuse of government regulations, negative externalities...in fact they made them much worse, every historic indication we have says trusting the free market to act moral is a bad idea.
1.2.4.1. Con: Changes in the greater culture lead to changes in both markets and politics.  Market actors often lead the way, because forward-thinking businesses and consumers are free to break away from convention and do things differently.  Political change usually comes later and is more sweeping, once a decisive majority of the population is in agreement and politicians feel safe to stick their necks out.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: That doesn't apply to about any of the problems listed. Slavery for example, did not disappear just because we made half the states free states. And even that was a massive political battle.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: Politicians acting once it is safe to do so is not a sufficient reason not for politicians to put their neck out, and actually do something when it is relevant.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: Part of a right, the most businesses can guarantee you, is worthless.
1.2.5. Pro: Gender neutral bathrooms are a great solution to many problems, but businesses and society can be encouraged to adopt them over time without being forced to do so by law.
1.2.5.1. Con: No alternate mechanism is suggested to make this happen
1.2.5.2. Con: Law is a tool we have at our disposal, the goal is a worthy one, and nobody is really hurt by the means, so there isn't really a good reason not to use it.
1.2.5.3. Con: As the parent acknowledges, this would solve problems that people are having at this very instant. Those problems don't go away because of a theoretical event in the future.
1.2.6. Con: The government already mandates the form of public bathrooms, [including number of stalls](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/osha-laws-restrooms-workplace-1332.html), without claims that such mandates are government overreach.
1.3. Pro: For those with unclear biology/sex \(transsexuals in the middle of transitioning and intersex people\) having unisex rooms can lead to clear mental health benefits. Lower anxiety, less stress over which room to use, and ultimately having a restroom where they won't "stick out" can help ease social conflict.
1.3.1. Pro: As [this study](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf) discuses, reliance upon gender segregation in our public spaces harms transgender and gender non-conforming people.
1.3.2. Pro: This would likely also lead to the same benefits for the people who haven't yet accepted these individuals.
1.3.3. Con: Communal rest rooms can raise anxiety and stress for people, who often use the space for different uses other than using the toilets. For example, women often adjust their underwear and check their appearance, something they are self-conscious of in front of men.
1.3.3.1. Con: Any discomfort will be dealt with quickly as people adjust in one way or another.
1.4. Pro: One single bathroom for all genders and non-genders is the most realistic yet effective option if society wishes to create more inclusive spaces.
1.4.1. Con: A bathroom labeled for people who not conform to the gender binary would cover the necessity for these genders. More than one room wouldn't be necessary.
1.4.1.1. Con: This is illogical. Separating bathrooms along gender lines and adding a third option makes as much sense as having separate bathrooms for various groups within the gender non-conforming group, who by this logic all deserve their own bathrooms.
1.4.2. Pro: As gender occurs on a spectrum, theoretically there exists an indefinite number of gender identities.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Both the [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/programs/safe-supportive/lgbt/key-terms.pdf) and the [American Medical Association](https://wire.ama-assn.org/ama-news/ama-takes-several-actions-supporting-transgender-patients) refer to the gender spectrum; these books are on medical and psychotic diagnoses, and almost every respectable medical professional in the US uses them.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: That's nothing more than an appeal to authority as there are a significant number of experts who do not support the gender spectrum.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: they are the leading authorities of their fields of study, and more then qualified to substantiate the ideas in questions, especially when the only thing attack their shared professional view is a completely unsupported claim.
1.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Dr. Debra W Soh \(PhD in sexual neuroscience\), Dr Jordan Peterson \(Clinical psychologist\), Dr. Gaad Saad \(Evolutionary behavioral scientist\), Dr. Geoffrey F. Miller \(evolutionary psychologist\), Dr. David P. Schmitt \(Personality psychologist\), all oppose the spectrum on scientific grounds and they are all experts in their fields.
1.4.3. Pro: All other places that might be made inclusive have already been made so. Only the bathroom remains.
1.4.4. Con: If a transgender individual truly believes they are a committed member of the sex they have chosen, they shouldn't need unisex bathrooms as they would fit in with either a male or female bathroom.
1.4.4.1. Con: Discomfort and danger experienced by transgender individuals using the bathroom matching their self-identified gender \(rather than genetic sex\) originates from the reaction of others who believe that the individual should not be in that gendered space.
1.4.4.2. Con: Many who are uncomfortable with using gendered bathrooms do not identify strictly as either male or female .
1.4.4.3. Con: Truly feeling you are one gender or the other does nothing to reduce the risk of harassment being seen in the restroom that coincides with that gender. You can't change your appearance overnight to fit the gender you wish to appear as. It takes months, years, or sometimes is never fully possible for a variety of reasons. The time between beginning transition and fully passing Is often the most dangerous time to use a gendered restroom because you stand out in either.
1.4.4.4. Con: Transgender citizens are subject to harassment and violence when using male- or female-specific restrooms. Creating unisex bathrooms would be beneficial for them.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: Transgender individuals make up less than 1% of America's population. Making changes to all bathrooms mandatory for such a small share of the population is inappropriate.
1.4.4.4.1.1. Con: Unisex bathrooms do not only benefit transgender people but are also [beneficial](http://jpl.sagepub.com/content/21/3/267) to the elderly, to disabled people and to young children, all of whom may have a carer of the opposite sex. Unisex bathrooms will permit these people to still get the aid they need from their carer while using the bathroom.
1.4.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Practical benefits are already in place at the stalls for people with disabilities that are often found in toilets.
1.4.4.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Disabled sections in public toilets are not as widespread as hoped for, as illustrated by weak [legislation](http://www.disability-europe.net/content/aned/media/ANED 2012 - NL - Task 4 - National Accessibility Report FINAL.doc) in the Netherlands. This means they are not sufficient.
1.4.4.4.1.2. Con: Unisex bathrooms do not work to the disadvantage of people without a trans identity since they still have toilets to use. Thus, they do not have a right to force inconveniences upon trans people even thought they would not suffer no disadvantage from the introduction of unisex bathrooms.
1.4.4.4.1.3. Con: The small number of people affected does not justify a violation of their rights. This represents a case of the [Tyranny of the Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority): a decision does not become right or just based on numbers.
1.4.4.4.1.3.1. Pro: Even today's separation of bathrooms by gender is a product of a society in which the overwhelming majority of power lies in the hands of men. Bathrooms were initially separated out of [male chauvinism](http://time.com/4337761/history-sex-segregated-bathrooms/) towards women.
1.4.4.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Ladies' [rooms](http://time.com/4337761/history-sex-segregated-bathrooms/) were established in order to protect women from the rough public life and to create a safe area for them, as they were regarded weak and vulnerable. One can argue that this is a step backwards as women's protection has lost its importance for society.
1.4.4.4.1.3.1.1.1. Con: [women aren't weak, or vulnerable, this is not a subject of moral interpretation, it is a fact.](https://www.modernghana.com/news/464092/are-women-really-vulnerable.html)
1.4.4.4.1.3.2. Con: Transgender individuals have the right to partake in elections, to vote for more open minded politicians or apply themselves as such, they are totally free to do lobby work and publicity to change the public opinion or to organize demonstrations. Consolidated, trans people are no helpless subjects to the tyranny of the majority as they are able to influence and shape the political process of decision making in their favor.
1.4.4.4.1.3.2.1. Pro: The fact that the unisex bathroomsÂ issue became a public and controversial debate underlines that transgender individuals are no passive subjects but active citizens with the ability to shape and change society.
1.4.4.4.1.3.2.2. Con: In a democracy, the plight of a minority - such as transgender individuals - is the difficulty of influencing public processes. If this were not the case, they would not require special attention.
1.4.4.4.1.3.3. Con: The term [Tyranny of the Majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority) is used in combination with " \(...\) constituting active oppression comparable to that of a tyrant or despot." Trans individuals are neither oppressed by the officials, nor are they subjects to governmental arbitrariness, they have the same basic rights than other citizens. Trans individuals simply cannot choose which restroom they go to in public, in respect of cisgendered people's feeling of discomfort.
1.4.4.4.1.3.3.1. Con: They do not have the right to use the correct restroom, instead they are forced into the one of a gender they do not belong to.
1.4.4.4.1.3.4. Pro: Justifying decisions with the mere dominance of a majority - may it be based on religion, skin color or gender - over a minority is dangerous. History knows plenty of examples for this, from slavery in the United States to the discrimination of homosexuals until only recently.
1.4.4.4.1.3.4.1. Pro: Giving special consideration to rights of sexual minorities, such as transgender individuals, is not as dangerous and will lead to no suppression of other groups.
1.4.4.4.1.3.4.2. Pro: Based on the majority's tyranny, bathroom segregation in the US was justified in the past: [for African-Americans](http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/eras/civil-war-reconstruction/jim-crow-laws-andracial-segregation/). This racial segregation seems insane today - yet it follows the same logic as the argument at hand here.
1.4.4.4.1.3.5. Con: Utilitarianism justifies the tyranny of the majority. Thus, it is acceptable from a major school of philosophical thought.
1.4.4.4.1.3.5.1. Con: Modern political systems - and especially democracies - do not work according to utilitarian principles. The happiness of the many does not justify a violation of rights of the few.
1.4.4.4.1.3.6. Pro: This is an inherent weakness in a majority rule system. For example, as trans people only make up about 1% of the population this means they could never influence a political decision, which results in unfair treatment of this group. Similarly, other minority groups, like gays on the issue of gay marriage, have struggled to make changes through elections. \([source](http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu)\)
1.4.4.4.1.4. Con: Many people without a transgender identity are in favor of unisex bathrooms, as is visible in cities likeÂ [New York](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-lgbt-idUSKCN0Z72XX),Â [Philadelphia](http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/LGBT-Gender-Neutral-Restrooms-206932591.html), [Seattle](http://www.seattle.gov/civilrights/programs/gender-justice-project/all-gender-restrooms/frequently-asked-questions), [Washington, D.C.](http://ohr.dc.gov/page/safe-bathrooms-dc), and [Austin](http://kxan.com/2015/01/16/austins-gender-neutral-bathroom-rules-go-into-effect/).
1.4.4.4.1.4.1. Con: The ordinances in these cities apply to single occupant bathrooms. This is different than suggesting that men and women should use the same bathroom concurrently.
1.4.4.4.1.4.1.1. Con: It's not that different. Bathroom stalls are already expected to be used by one person at a time.
1.4.4.4.1.5. Pro: Studies that estimate the share of transgender individuals in the United States speak of [0.03%](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2015/adrm/carra-wp-2015-03.pdf) to [0.3%](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Gates-How-Many-People-LGBT-Apr-2011.pdf) \(usually with disclaimers about the rough nature of these estimates\).
1.4.4.4.1.6. Con: Presuming the references survey is [this one](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/how-many-adults-identify-as-transgender-in-the-united-states/), it is imperfect: as noted on page 7, the data is collected only from 19 small, rural states, giving it a small sample size, and the conservative nature of those areas may well be suppressing the true number \(we might have settled on a number, but the number's accuracy is still up for debate\).
1.4.4.4.1.7. Con: Reliable data on the share of transgender individuals in the population is difficult to establish as many of them hide their gender identity.
1.4.4.4.1.7.1. Pro: This is oftentimes done to evade discrimination. Subsequently, US states with laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual identity showcase [higher shares](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/09/upshot/the-search-for-the-best-estimate-of-the-transgender-population.html) of transgender people in surveys.
1.4.4.4.1.7.2. Con: Although that may be true, there is no reason to believe that the margin of error is large enough to reduce the reliability of related statistics.
1.4.4.4.1.7.2.1. Con: There is no reason to believe there is enough data to have reliable records of these statistics.
1.4.4.4.1.7.2.1.1. Con: Having little information is not synonymous to having none. If a decision must be made using the information we do have, then a decision must be made. If more information changes the statistics in the future, then redress can be made at that time.
1.4.4.4.1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: A lack of data is a sufficient reason to believe that there could be a significant margin of error.
1.4.4.4.1.7.2.1.1.2. Con: The estimated number in various claims ranges by a factor of at least 34. Variation in results like that is not promising.
1.4.4.4.1.8. Con: [Attempts to discriminate against trans people for the purpose of military service have been met with outrage.](https://www.hrc.org/blog/tremendous-bipartisan-outrage-over-trumps-transgender-military-ban) Very few people believe that because a group is a minority, it is okay to prosecute them.
1.4.4.4.1.8.1. Con: Public outrage for removing trans people from military service was directed at a perceived injustice towards a minority. Removing gender segregated washrooms would be an injustice towards a majority.
1.4.4.4.1.8.1.1. Con: There is still no provided reason why this is supposedly some great injustice to those comfortably upon the gender binary.
1.4.4.4.1.8.1.2. Con: It would be the end of an injustice to men, as they would no longer be forced to be grouped with other men.
1.4.4.4.1.8.1.3. Con: It would be the end of an injustice against women as they would no longer be forced to be associated with other women.
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: According to [a study](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf), almost 70% of respondents in a survey of transgender individuals reported to have experienced verbal harassment in the context of gender-segregated public bathrooms, and 9% even physical assault.
1.4.4.4.3. Pro: In [one study](http://search.proquest.com/docview/1439085659?pq-origsite=gscholar) among transgender individuals in San Francisco, two out of five respondents reported negative bathroom experiences that ranged from harassment to violence.
1.4.4.4.4. Pro: This will create a more accepting environment for trans individuals in general.
1.4.4.4.4.1. Pro: The only way to help people become accepting of a new way of life is to expose them to it. Public policies that adapt to the need of trans individuals make their needs more prominent in society, creating more understanding.
1.4.4.4.5. Con: If businesses and communities wish to voluntarily create unisex restrooms in addition to the already existent gendered ones, they can. But such a decision should not be demanded by fiat.
1.4.4.4.5.1. Pro: Bathrooms are for the benefit of customers to that business and that owner is in the best position to know what will best serve its customers, whether that includes powder areas, children toliets, nursing stations or unisex bathrooms.
1.4.4.4.5.2. Pro: It should be the choice of the owner of a privately-run property \(such as a shop\) what facilities they want to provide at their venue, within reason. Interference by the state would be overregulation.
1.4.4.4.5.2.1. Con: It is often by a government regulation that they exist at all, it does not make sense to say that the government has no place modeling in affairs it is already thoroughly involved in.
1.4.4.4.5.2.2. Con: All building are subject to building codes that dictate almost every aspect of their construction, often for good purpose, this is why it is very rare for even cheap constructions to kill people, even during disasters.
1.4.4.4.5.2.3. Con: Almost every city, or county has zoning laws that determine what people are allowed to build on their property, for example, it is almost everywhere illegal to build a chemical plant in the middle of a residential neighborhood.
1.4.4.4.5.2.4. Con: Even if we exclude private property, what should be done in the case of public property, like schools, is still a matter of grave importance.
1.4.4.4.5.2.5. Con: Even applying the [strict scrutiny test](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_scrutiny), it is clear this is a narrowly tailored policy serving a compelling government interest that is least restrictive.
1.4.4.4.5.2.5.1. Pro: The compelling government interest is defending the rights of many, including transgender individuals.
1.4.4.4.5.2.5.2. Pro: It is narrowly tailored in that it neatly, and succinctly addresses the problem. One restroom grants equal protection to all.
1.4.4.4.5.2.5.3. Pro: It is the least restrictive means of accomplishing this end in that it isn't really restrictive at all. A person has to build one restroom instead of two, that's it.
1.4.4.4.5.3. Con: Giving transgendered individuals their own restroom singles them out. The introduction of transgender-specific bathrooms would only add to existing kinds of discrimination.
1.4.4.4.5.4. Con: If the issue of unisex bathrooms should be voluntary, so should all decisions regarding what bathrooms are provided. However, gender-segregated bathrooms are often enforced by [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_segregation_in_public_restrooms#U.S.).
1.4.4.4.5.4.1. Con: It is enforced by law because men and women represent virtually 50/50 of the human race. Therefore equal access must be guaranteed by law.
1.4.4.4.5.4.1.1. Con: Segregated restrooms provide no meaningful benefit to society.
1.4.4.4.5.4.2. Con: The law has to guarantee equality but must also apply reasonable guidelines. Completely removing gender segregated facilities is not a reasonable solution to a problem that is relatively minor.
1.4.4.4.5.4.2.1. Con: No reason is provided as to why it is so difficult not to segregate restrooms, or even as to why it is so difficult not to force them to be segregated.
1.4.4.4.5.4.2.1.1. Con: Most laws \(particularly those that have existed for a long time\) do not explicitly outline their reason for being there as in most cases the reason is implied or understood and agreed upon by public consensus. Laws often reflect social norms and accepted moral standards. For example, murder is against the law even though it is not explicitly explain why that is, but society overwhelmingly agrees murder is wrong and therefore illegal.
1.4.4.4.5.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Since the only reason given to support this antiquated law is that we don't need to, we must instead focus on information we do have, like how it is, and promotes gender segregation, and alienates parts of the population, since the only thing that will be said in support of this law is that they don't need to support it, the law should thus be abolished.
1.4.4.4.5.4.2.1.1.2. Con: Saying that there is no given explanation for why a law was made does not magically make the law just, without a pressing reason for the law to exist, the law is trivially voidable.
1.4.4.4.5.5. Con: It would save money and time by not forcing business to have multiple bathrooms.
1.4.4.4.5.5.1. Con: Businesses may lose customers that wish to have segregated restrooms. The short term savings would not compensate for the long term loss of revenue.
1.4.4.4.5.5.1.1. Con: If the decision was mandated by law, these customers would have no where else to go.
1.4.4.4.5.5.1.2. Con: It is unlikely these people would be so concerned with this issue that they would be willing to abandon establishments they frequent.
1.4.4.4.5.5.1.2.1. Con: People can boycott or stop using a service or avoid an establishment for the most trivial reasons. Something as divisive as the elimination of segregated washrooms would likely driven customers to a competitor.
1.4.4.4.5.5.2. Pro: Bathrooms not separated by gender or sex provide people the opportunity to waste less time looking for their respective bathroom - and more time doing their business.
1.4.4.4.6. Con: This might not be a helpful policy to avoid the harassment. If a trans person is harassed by men in a male restroom \(or by women in a female restroom\), why would the harassment stop if the bathroom was unisex? It would still be the same people sharing the same restroom.
1.4.4.4.6.1. Con: It cannot be guaranteed that all harassment against transgender individuals would stop; however, harassment on the basis that a transgender individual is using the 'wrong' restroom would stop if public restrooms became genderless, because the gender \(or lack thereof\) of any given person would cease to constitute their right \(or not\) to access a given restroom.
1.4.4.4.7. Con: Someone who alters their appearance does not somehow become the opposite sex. If someone who is not labeled "transgender" modifies their appearance to be of the opposite sex, that act does not qualify them to use the restroom for the opposite sex. \(Relevant because if transgender is not a "real" sex, then the above argument is reduced to "men are subject to harassment when trying to use female restrooms \(and vice versa\)", a completely different argument.
1.4.5. Con: Using family or handicapped bathrooms rather than gender neutral bathrooms is far more realistic as it requires less change.
1.4.5.1. Con: Special bathrooms for families and handicapped individuals are not available everywhere.
1.4.6. Pro: Public toilets are often a huge problem for transgender people and people that are non-binary/gender-queer. It can lead to a lot of hate, discrimination, violance and problems for those people
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.6. Pro: Unisex bathrooms represent societal progress regarding equity and human rights.
1.6.1. Pro: Gender segregation reinforces gender discrimination: it implies that men and women are different in some important way, which in turn reinforces sexism of all forms.
1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.6.2. Con: Societal progress is all very well, but it is often difficult to know where to draw the line once the first changes have been put in motion. If public bathrooms are no longer separated by sex or gender, what will become of public changing/locker rooms? The further this kind of progress is allowed to go, the more moral obstacles and controversy that society will encounter as it attempts to navigate what is \(and is not\) appropriate to instigate in the name of progress.
1.6.2.1. Con: No institution should be segregated on the bases of sex or gender. They should all be unisex, so that that might happen is a non-issue.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: This would violate people's privacy, by forcing them to be nude with other genders.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: If the addition of other genders would violate their privacy, then their privacy is already being violated by members of their own gender, and the institution must be restructured to guard their privacy anyway.
1.6.3. Con: What represents actual progress and what merely represents a move into the wrong direction - for example towards moral deterioration - Â is up to subjective interpretation.
1.6.3.1. Con: The fact is that in practice this solution works. Regardless of one's own cultural or religious biases, claims backed up by experiment and success are undeniable.
1.6.3.2. Pro: This so called societal progress can also be regarded as societal decadence and demoralization, depending on the individual point of view, because once established and practiced important values are no longer taken care of.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.3.1.1.
1.6.3.3. Con: Much of the historical change would be seen as actual progress by a large number of people. Therefore, there is more than just subjective, namely intersubjective interpretation.
1.6.4. Con: Creating unisex bathrooms is a solution to avoid confrontation. It does not eliminate the root of the problem: disrespect for people who do not conform to the gender/sex binary.
1.6.5. Pro: Unisex bathrooms may reduce the level of sexual taboo between men and women.
1.6.5.1. Pro: It could make men more aware and less afraid of periods by making tampon/sanitary towel machines part of every day life.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: Some men already use sanitary accessories for a variety of reasons. Unisex facilities would allow them to do so without discomfort.
1.6.5.1.2. Pro: It would make facilities for menstruation available to trans men.
1.6.5.1.3. Con: Most men only use public toilets occasionally, so any changes there would not be part of their every day life. Simultaneously, most men have wife, girlfriend, sister or mother they share toilets with at home and learn about periods that way.
1.6.6. Pro: Unisex bathrooms would not reinforce questionable cultural beliefs over gender, for example that all of humanity neatly fits into either one of two categories or that the bathroom use of men and women is intrinsically different and thus needs separation.
1.6.6.1. Pro: The existing separation of bathrooms by gender has [nothing to do](http://time.com/4337761/history-sex-segregated-bathrooms/) with biological differences. Historically, it is rather the product of male chauvinism towards women and the ambition to protect them from a rough world. This should not be reproduced anymore.
1.6.6.1.1. Con: Even if the historical object of the separation was unrelated, the overwhelming majority of people today see it as related.
1.6.6.2. Con: Those cultural beliefs are not questionable. If they haven't been questioned in all of human history, their current questioning is overwhelmingly likely to be due to current tendencies to question beliefs, rather than their inherent questionability.
1.6.6.2.1. Con: They have been questioned for just about all time
1.6.7. Pro: Gender neutral bathrooms could reduce the disproportionate shame directed against women regarding body functions held in common among all sexes and genders.
1.6.7.1. Con: There is no data to suggest that gender neutral bathrooms reduce the "disproportionate" shame directed against women.
1.6.8. Con: Separated bathrooms are a symptom of discrimination - not the cause. Treating the symptom doesn't get rid of the cause.
1.6.8.1. Con: When treating a disease, you don't ignore the symptoms, especially since often times when you do, they are the things that end up killing the patient.
1.6.8.2. Con: This symptom makes the disease worse, regardless of the cause of segregated restrooms, unisex bathrooms are part of the cure.
1.6.9. Con: Existing community institutions must be respected. A universal demand to force people against their taboos  without an extended period of deliberation is a colonialist ethic.
1.6.9.1. Con: The subject of unisex bathrooms is being debated at length in many places, such as [here](https://www.kialo.com/no-public-restrooms-should-be-separated-by-either-sex-or-gender-1266/1266.0=1266.1).
1.6.10. Pro: Gendered rooms leads to weird enforcement \(reinforcement of stereotypes/norms\). In order to "catch" transsexual people, stricter gender norms and more stereotypical representations of sex/gender are enforced. Most often this actually targets gender nonconforming people, who are almost always gay/lesbian. No way to really confirm biological sex or gender without invasive tests. What method would be used? ID? Bathroom monitors that check genitals? This is an ongoing issue.
1.6.11. Pro: Gender separated toilets cause, promote or foster gender stereotypes.
1.6.11.1. Pro: Gender-separated bathrooms were originally introduced [to protect women](https://theconversation.com/how-did-public-bathrooms-get-to-be-separated-by-sex-in-the-first-place-59575). They therefore foster the stereotype of women needing special accommodation to function in society.
1.6.11.2. Pro: Separating people by bathrooms contributes to the stereotype that the bodily functions of women are - or should be - [any different or less unpleasant](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/angelina-chapin/poo-pourri_b_4148199.html) than those of men.
1.6.12. Pro: It would be an act that affirms the equality of men and women.
1.6.12.1. Pro: It would end a practice that daily reinforces the idea that men and women are not equal.
1.6.12.1.1. Con: It is inaccurate to say this reinforces the idea that men and women are unequal, as rarely is there a great disparity in quality of restrooms not brought about logistically; differentiation does not inherently infer hierarchy.
1.6.12.1.1.1. Con: To separate men, women, non-binary individuals, and trans individuals from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their gender generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely to ever be undone.
1.6.12.1.1.2. Con: While gender-separated facilities may not in themselves create gender inequality, they could add fuel to the fire. It has been proven that our mind naturally creates a [them/us mentality](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/the-us-vs-them-mentality-how-group-thinking-can-irrationally-divide-us/) when groups are identified as separate; the existence of needlessly gender-separated public facilities thus allows for more spaces in which this mentality could be triggered, increasing the likelihood of irrational gender prejudice and therefore inequality.
1.6.12.1.1.2.1. Pro: If we stop separating public facilities by sex or gender, we stop forcing people into 2 groups and therefore do not allow for the concretely divided mentality that society currently has surrounding gender/sex.
1.6.12.1.1.2.2. Con: Separate bathrooms do not actually add any group classification that doesn't already exist.
1.6.12.1.1.2.3. Pro: The [Norwegian military](http://time.com/36484/norwegian-army-unisex-dorms/) reduced sexual assault and harassment by eliminating gendered barracks.
1.6.13. Pro: From a gender and trans-rights perspective, it is only right to introduce unisex bathrooms.
1.6.13.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.
1.6.13.2. Con: Biologically, the [vast majority](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/\(SICI\)1520-6300\(200003/04\)12:2%3C151::AID-AJHB1%3E3.0.CO;2-F/abstract) of humans are either male or female from their birth onward. This is the reality that gender-separated bathrooms do and should reflect.
1.6.13.2.1. Con: [Sex is a spectrum](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/visualizing-sex-as-a-spectrum/).
1.6.13.2.1.1. Pro: The Intersex Society of North America lists [statistics](http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency) on intersex births. For example, one percent of people have a body that differs from the fe/male standard.
1.6.13.2.2. Con: The claim that a person's gender is fixed from birth goes against both the collective experience of trans people and [research](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/) that indicates a biological basis for a transgender identity. Questioning one's gender identity is thus natural for some people and anything but a voluntary choice.
1.6.13.2.2.1. Con: Transsexualism is clearly a congenital issue, and indeed fixed from birth. Earliest predictors of transsexualism tend to appear between the ages of 3 and 7. Those with gender dysphoria do not outgrow it and have it until treated with hormone therapy and surgery. It's quite clearly fixed from birth. Sex, however, clearly changes, given hormone replacement therapy. Gender has a few definitions, mostly pertaining to transsexual neurology.
1.6.13.2.2.2. Con: Questioning one's gender identity and one's voluntary choice to impose what one thinks one's gender identity is on society \(in the form of demanding a separate bathroom, for instance\) are two very distinct things.
1.6.13.2.2.2.1. Pro: There are many different cultures in which transsexuals take on a different cultural and social role than they do in western society. The medical condition is quite clearly distinct from the labels, classification, etc. that we use socially.
1.6.13.2.2.3. Con: All kinds of beliefs about one's identity can have a biological basis, even absurd ideas such as the self-perception as an animal. However, this doesn't mean that other people have to acknowledge this identity or adjust their behavior accordingly.
1.6.13.2.3. Con: Some people are born with ambiguous genitalia and hormonal status which results in them having some traits that are both male and female.
1.6.13.2.3.1. Pro: [Klinefelter Syndrome](http://www.medicinenet.com/klinefelter_syndrome/article.htm) is a term used to describe males who have an extra X chromosome in most of their cells.
1.6.13.2.3.2. Con: Such birth defects affect an extreme minority of people. [Klinefelter Syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1634840/) is the most prevalent sex chromosome disorder and it affects only 1 in 500 men \(0.2%\). Making special considerations in society for every rare abnormality is not pragmatic.
1.6.13.2.3.2.1. Con: The total is estimated to be around [1.7%](http://oii-usa.org/2563/how-common-is-intersex-in-humans/) which is a sizable chunk of the population.
1.6.13.2.3.2.2. Con: We can do more, we should do more.
1.6.13.2.4. Con: Being biologically male or female refers to one's sex and not to one's gender identity.
1.6.13.2.4.1. Con: Biological sex is an extremely reliable predictor of gender identity and other aspects of human sexuality. Segregation based on biological sex is therefore a reasonable metric to justify gender segregated restrooms.
1.6.13.2.4.1.1. Con: no reason is given why we should discriminate on any of those things.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2. Con: We should not discriminate, except on relevant bases of actual performance, ability or competence.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1. Con: Based on that logic, it is unjustifiable for women shelters to refuse access to men. It is unjustifiable to have men and women in separate prisons. It is unjustifiable to have men and women using separate change rooms at sport complexes and other public settings where nudity is expected. Competence is not the only justifiable reason for discrimination. There are various other factors to consider.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: It is unjustifiable for women shelters to refuse access to men. It is unjustifiable to have men and women in separate prisons. It is unjustifiable to have men and women using separate changing rooms at sports complexes and other public settings where nudity is expected. All these statements are true.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Actually all the statements are demonstrably false, and for very obvious reasons.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Women's shelters deny access to men because women who use this service are often victims of physical abuse from their male partners. A male presence in such a space would make it difficult for battered women to feel safe.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Almost half the population is male, these women are going to have to learn to deal with men.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: That doesn't have to happen immediately after suffering trauma. Recovery necessitates security, which women shelters provide to traumatized and battered vulnerable women.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: their are traumatized and battered vulnerable men that need this same service.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Men's Rights Activists advocate for men shelters and men specific services.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Unisex violent relationship shelters are a better easier solution.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.3. Con: there is no reason they would project their attacker onto every man they met.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Men and women occupy different prisons because it risks having the most violent elements of society abuse female inmates. Men get abused in men only prisons... having women in that space would likely make things much worse.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Nobody should be abusing anybody in prisons, the acceptable amount of prison rape is 0, and it is a reachable goal, their is no point using our indifference to this problem as an attack.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Ideally that is true, but any concept that entails real world applications require the inclusion of human nature as a factor. Prison is not a safe place for a myriad of reasons.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: That prisons are unsafe is a problem that must be dealt with independently of the question of sexual segregation. It is quite possible to make them safe, [other countries have safe prisons](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/09/why-scandinavian-prisons-are-superior/279949/).
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Men and women use different change rooms where nudity is expected because a shared space violates expectations of decency \(from both points of view of being exposed to the nakedness of the opposite sex and exposing one's own nakedness to the opposite sex\). Sharing the space also risks voyeurism and sexual harassment and abuse.
1.6.13.2.4.1.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.2.1.1.1.
1.6.13.2.4.1.3. Con: The 14 amendment prohibits any of the discrimination here described.
1.6.13.2.4.1.3.1. Con: The 14th Amendment prohibits "unjustified" discrimination... not discrimination wholesale. The government must have important or compelling reasons to justify the discrimination, and the discrimination must be carefully tailored to serve those reasons. As outlined in many other claims, there are compelling reasons to believe unisex washrooms would not serve the best interested to the public.
1.6.13.2.4.1.3.1.1. Con: That there are compelling reasons to believe unisex washrooms would not serve the best interest of the public is not outlined in any claims in this discussion.
1.6.13.2.4.1.3.1.2. Con: The best interest of the public is not sufficient reason, as this is strict scrutiny territory. There needs to be a compelling goverment interest, and even then, there are stringent conditions.
1.6.13.2.5. Con: -> See discussion #1570: Gender \(the [concept](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/gendermed/sexandgender.html) of masculinity and femininity\) is a social construct.
1.6.13.2.6. Con: We don't segregate based on color as a result of this 'reality' we apparently should reflect.
1.6.13.2.6.1. Con: We don't segregate on color because color alone is not a reliable predictor of needs, behavior and ability.
1.6.13.2.6.1.1. Con: Gender isn't either.
1.6.13.2.6.1.1.1. Con: It is scientifically proven that men and women have different behaviors, interests, physical capabilities and certain biological needs \(in spite of significant overlap\). Therefore gender is a reliable predictor for these metrics.
1.6.13.2.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Everyone can satisfy their needs at a standard sit down toilet, there is no reason they should be separated no matter how many times one insists that they should be forced into their gender roles.
1.6.13.2.6.2. Con: The inclusion of different colors in a washroom is not the same as the inclusion of both sexes in that same setting. Particularly since color affects both sexes.
1.6.13.2.6.2.1. Con: Sex affects all colors, so there seems to be nothing more to this argument then that sex is not color, which is a very weak, very strained argument.
1.6.13.2.6.2.2. Con: It is not explained how they are different, merely asserted that they are, one can say that a dew drop is different from condensation all day, and never once will it be true.
1.6.13.2.7. Con: That humans "are" a given gender from birth is subjective, so to reflect this via gender-separated bathrooms would be to reflect - and force on others - an arguably false reality.
1.6.13.2.7.1. Con: Regardless of whether a binary concept of gender is false, many of the social structures and roles that humans know are built around it. This why people who fail to conform to these conceptions tend to be [marginalised](http://cydathria.com/ms_donna/intelligiblity.html), as is the case for many gender-queer people.
1.6.13.2.7.1.1. Con: As has happened in the past, when we stop validating these changes, they go away.
1.6.13.2.7.1.2. Con: Society is changing, and we are becoming more accepting, tomboys, and effeminate men are relatively common today, as are other groups that gender roles traditionally marginalized.
1.6.13.2.7.1.3. Con: There is no reason why gender should be so linked to who we are.
1.6.13.2.7.1.4. Con: The forced association of our gender, and who we are is damaging to everyone, for example, little girls being told not to do things they find fun because it's not 'lady like', boys being called weak because they cry, these are horrible things, this is a social norm that is evil, and needs to end.
1.6.13.2.7.2. Pro: As theorists such as Judith Butler have asserted, gender can be seen as [performative](http://lauragonzalez.com/TC/BUTLER_gender_trouble.pdf), i.e. a cultural inscription of meaning on one's anatomical sex \(pp. 24-5\). Under this view, facilities such as gendered bathrooms constitute one means of regulating and compelling a false idea of gender coherence.
1.6.13.2.8. Con: Gender is a spectrum.
1.6.13.2.8.1. Con: If gender is a spectrum, âcisgenderâ has no meaning.
1.6.13.2.8.1.1. Con: "Cisgender" would simply describe two particular points on this spectrum and people who consider themselves as having a gender identity that corresponds with their birth sex. There might be indefinite other gender identities that do not have this particular characteristic, yet people could still consider themselves as cisgender.
1.6.13.2.8.2. Con: If gender is a spectrum, that means itâs a continuum between two extremes, and everyone is located somewhere along that continuum.
1.6.13.2.8.2.1. Con: This is not a problem with the gender spectrum, it is an essential feature. Degrees of masculinity and feminity are clear in how people present themselves and perceived by others, as evidence by categories such as tomboy or femme that recognise differences along a spectrum.
1.6.13.2.8.3. Con: If gender is a spectrum, how many possible gender identities do we need to recognise in order not to be oppressive?
1.6.13.2.8.3.1. Con: The idea of a spectrum is precisely to not have to recognise two, or even a few, particular gender categories; but to instead recognise that gender is complex and manifests in a way that often defies easy categorisation. This in turn would lead to less restrictions based on these categories, such as bathroom access.
1.6.13.2.8.3.2. Con: As gender identity is subjective we should assume a person's identity is as unique as their screen name.
1.6.13.3. Pro: Unisex bathrooms would help transgender, agender, or non-binary individuals to [authentically](http://time.com/3974186/transgender-bathroom-debate/) live their identity, which separated bathrooms deny them.
1.6.13.4. Con: Some people argue transgender [feelings are not valid](http://time.com/3974186/transgender-bathroom-debate/), implying there is nothing "natural" about it.
1.6.13.4.1. Pro: The idea of one's gender not matching one's sex was until recently considered a mental illness.
1.6.13.4.1.1. Con: The idea that one's gender didn't match their biological sex is a mental illness is currently rejected.
1.6.13.4.1.2. Con: Hysteria was until recently considered an illness.
1.6.13.4.1.3. Con: The idea of having to control people's gender identity rose in the mid-1800s when the medical establishment and its discourse around sexuality started to [gain power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Sexuality) in society.
1.6.13.4.1.3.1. Pro: [For example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculine_Barbin:_Being_the_Recently_Discovered_Memoirs_of_a_Nineteenth-century_French_Hermaphrodite#Background), in the Middle Ages in France it was accepted for so-called "hermaphrodites" to change their gender \(once\), and even get married.
1.6.13.4.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.6.13.4.3. Con: -> See 1.6.13.2.2.
1.6.13.4.4. Con: Most people agree that glasses are not immoral, so this talk of what is natural seems of little concern.
1.6.13.5. Pro: Unisex bathrooms ensure that all members of society have equal access.
1.6.13.5.1. Pro: Unisex Â bathrooms are beneficial to transgender populations, who are often [discriminated against and excluded](http://jpl.sagepub.com/content/21/3/267).
1.6.13.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.2.
1.6.13.5.1.2. Pro: The emotional / psychological discomfort a transgender individual feels as a result of separate bathrooms can be eliminated.
1.6.13.5.1.3. Con: Unisex bathrooms merely treat the symptoms of discrimination against trans individuals, but not the root cause. The problem will therefore likely persist.
1.6.13.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.1.
1.6.13.5.3. Con: While unisex bathrooms might improve the access for transgender individuals, they might equally make access harder for other individuals.
1.6.13.5.3.1. Pro: Many religious groups, such as Muslims or Orthodox Jews,Â would be unable to utilize unisex facilities and be denied a basic human service in public, further ostracizing the women and children in these cultures.
1.6.13.5.3.1.1. Con: While freedom of religion is freedom to practice your religion and not be persecuted for it, this does not mean everyone should have to behave according to your specific ideals.
1.6.13.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Freedom of religion, like all rights, is limited. Once one's religious practice starts infringing on the rights of others, it generally ceases to be protected practice.
1.6.13.5.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Correct. But the religious practice in question does not deny either separate gender access to a bathroom. Removing all non-unisex bathrooms causes people with such protected practices to have no choice for which bathroom they may use, and infringes on their rights.
1.6.13.5.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is not private individual's job to provide the implements needed for others to practice their religion, demanding that they do is a clear infringement upon these individual's rights.
1.6.13.5.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is not required for schools to ring out the prayer times for their Muslim students, nor for them to build the schools schedule around them, they must allow them to practice their faith, but they do so in a way that is the least intrusive to others.
1.6.13.5.3.1.2. Pro: In Orthodox Judaism there are a number of settings where men and women are [not supposed to mingle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_separation_in_Judaism).
1.6.13.5.3.1.2.1. Con: This is specific to the Orthodox tradition which is followed [by only 10% of Jews](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/08/26/a-portrait-of-american-orthodox-jews/) in the US. Other forms of Judaism rarely separate genders any more that secular western society does.
1.6.13.5.3.1.2.2. Con: There is a [long tradition](http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/a-jewish-solution-on-transgender-bathrooms/) in Jewish law that takes genders other than male and female into account.
1.6.13.5.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: The solution suggested by Jewish law is to combine privacy and modesty concerns and change bathrooms into single-occupancy unisex facilities.
1.6.13.5.3.1.2.3. Pro: The number of Orthodox Jews in the US is estimated to stand at [around 530.000](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/08/26/a-portrait-of-american-orthodox-jews/), which equals about 0.16% of the US population. This share is similar to that of transgender individuals and there is no reason why the preferences of the latter should be valued above those of Orthodox Jews.
1.6.13.5.3.1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.5.
1.6.13.5.3.1.3. Con: Many of the rules established elsewhere for religious reasons are not followed in the United States out of religious tolerance.
1.6.13.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: In countries like Saudi Arabia that adhere to a strict form of Sunni Islam, women and men [are separated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia#Sex_segregation) in public places like restaurants, banks and hospitals. This is not the case in the US and has never been up for debate.
1.6.13.5.3.1.4. Con: There is no mention of gender-segregated toilets prior to the 1700s, and there was no legislation in the USA around them until the [late 1800s](http://time.com/4337761/history-sex-segregated-bathrooms/). These groups managed just fine prior to gender-segregation, so they should be able to manage after it too.
1.6.13.5.3.1.5. Con: Cubicles with lockable doors can ensure privacy and prevent discomfort as well as harassment in public bathrooms.
1.6.13.5.3.2. Pro: Especially [children](http://www.wsj.com/articles/eleven-states-sue-obama-administration-over-transgender-bathroom-policy-1464207455) might feel uncomfortable or even insecure with accessing bathrooms that are used by individuals of the other gender, too.
1.6.13.5.3.2.1. Con: Children are already using bathrooms meant for the other gender, since they are often accompanied by adults.
1.6.13.5.3.2.2. Con: Children already might feel uncomfortable or insecure using bathrooms with adults of the same gender. Their potential discomfort with adults of the opposite gender isn't any more valid or important than the discomfort that we already expect them to deal with.
1.6.13.5.3.2.3. Con: Children's discomfort with the other gender is not given by nature bit an issue of education and socialization. As the example of Scandinavian countries shows, even nudity in front of adults of the other sex can be [perfectly normal](http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/03/14/scandinavian-attitudes-to-nudi/).
1.6.13.5.3.2.3.1. Con: Even though it may be true that discomfort of children is not naturally given, but caused by socialization \(I am not contending this\), the normalicy of nudity in front of strangers of the opposite sex is not "shown by the Scandinavian example" as claimed above. Also in Scandinavia, children above a certain age \(approximately 6\) stop being naked around strangers of the opposite sex.
1.6.13.5.3.2.3.1.1. Con: That the kids eventually are socialized does not contradict that they do not start with a neutral response, or that exposure would make them suffer.
1.6.13.5.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Whether children start with a natural response, or whether exposure would make them suffer, has not been proven or disproven with an example which contrasts Scandinavia to other countries \(such as the US\). Which is what the parent claim was about.
1.6.13.5.3.3. Pro: Having unisex bathrooms would be displeasing for females. Women sit on toilet seats, however most men do not and regularly end up urinating on the seat, floor or even the wall. That is unsanitary and unacceptable for any woman.
1.6.13.5.3.3.1. Con: These are not principal issues but issues concerning behavior and education, both of which can change and improve.
1.6.13.5.3.3.2. Con: There is plenty of evidence that male behavior changes in the presence of women, for example [at work places](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=eTTeCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT173&lpg=PT173&dq=behavior+of+men+%22among+each+other%22&source=bl&ots=TEJ-m_mtk-&sig=yN7EnXwd3UdzAAfUanXE2WDnARI&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwias7fHjMzNAhXCipQKHeNRCH8Q6AEISDAH#v=onepage&q=behavior%20of%20men%20%22among%20each%20other%22&f=false), [in prisons](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=hW0rAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=%22presence+of+women%22+male+behavior+work&source=bl&ots=BipqvBQowD&sig=_R-jyqkvNZXtppIkZujjCQWyGCc&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXiMvtjczNAhUMo5QKHdbcBsEQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&q=%22presence%20of%20women%22%20male%20behavior%20work&f=false) and in situations where [social status](http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304403804579264272004583860) is on the line. Unisex bathrooms might thus actually help to solve the problem of male bathroom cleanness.
1.6.13.5.3.3.2.1. Con: Work places and prisons are social places while public toilets are more or less anonymous. Thus the situations cannot be easily compared.
1.6.13.5.3.3.3. Pro: Women will have to lift the seat more often, risking more health and hygiene problems.
1.6.13.5.3.3.3.1. Con: There is no data to suggest that lifting the seat risks more health and hygiene problems.
1.6.13.5.3.3.4. Pro: Men like the convenience of peeing fast at the expense of being a little messy. It would be suboptimal as a man to give that convenience up.
1.6.13.5.3.3.4.1. Con: By that logic, it would make sense to compel men to sit down, as that would increase sanitation, potentially saving lives.
1.6.13.5.3.3.4.1.1. Con: This doesnât make sense, if I like the convenience of peeing standing up, so why would I want to sit down. If your read the claim you responded to, you would see that some men do not care if they miss.
1.6.13.5.3.3.4.1.2. Con: Pee doesnât have enough bacteria to get you sick generally. It actually has almost none. Itâs [almost sterile](https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2473,00.html).
1.6.13.5.3.3.4.1.2.1. Con: When people see their environment as dirty, it compels them to care less about sanitation, when they see their environment is clean, they are more likely to care about sanitation.
1.6.13.5.3.3.5. Con: Unisex bathrooms could include urinals, which are more convenient for those who can use them and result in less mess on the sit-down toilets for everyone.
1.6.13.5.3.3.6. Con: There are solutions that provide a sanitary environment for both sexes, like plastic covers one can place on a toilet seat.
1.6.13.5.3.3.6.1. Con: Plastic covers do not help against urine on the floor or the walls.
1.6.13.5.3.3.6.2. Con: Having to change plastic covers after every use is bad for the environment.
1.6.13.5.3.3.6.3. Pro: In general, toilet seats in public restrooms need regular cleaning before use irrespective of whether they are being used by men or women.
1.6.13.5.3.3.6.3.1. Pro: Women often create the same unsanitary conditions by not sitting on the toilet seat, but going about their business without touching the seat.
1.6.13.5.3.3.7. Con: -> See 1.6.13.5.3.3.6.3.1.
1.6.13.5.3.3.8. Con: The location of the toilets makes for a bigger difference than the gender segregation. Toilets in museums are cleaner than those at subway stations regardless of the gender. Thus, sanitary levels are not gender specific.
1.6.13.5.3.3.9. Con: Individuals with a penis are more likely to touch inner parts of the toilet bowl and thus come into contact with unsanitary surfaces. So statistically, this affects men more than women.
1.6.13.5.3.3.9.1. Con: Women tend to be smaller and therefore they are closer to the unsanitary surface with their whole body.
1.6.13.5.3.3.9.2. Con: Men can stand up while peeing. This is not as easy for women.
1.6.13.5.3.3.9.3. Con: The issue at hand is less about sanitation and more about disgust.
1.6.13.5.3.3.10. Pro: Mens' public restrooms generally smell like urine more than womens' ones, simply because men usually do not sit and thus quite often urinate off the mark. \([cleanlink.com](http://www.cleanlink.com/hs/article/Odor-Control-In-The-Restroom--8251); [blithe.com](http://www.blithe.com/bhq7.3/7.3.04.html); [everything2.com](http://everything2.com/title/Adventures+in+the+women%2527s+bathroom+%253A+A+male+perspective)\)
1.6.13.5.3.3.10.1. Con: -> See 1.6.13.5.3.3.8.
1.6.13.5.3.3.11. Con: A large part of this problem may be do to our tying of peeing standing up to 'manliness', as creating unisex bathrooms may help with the gender gap, and thus help stem this paranoid delusional fear of not being 'manly' enough, this behavior could dissipate over time.
1.6.13.5.3.3.11.1. Con: Although perceived manliness may also be a small factor, men stand mostly because it's more comfortable and also more hygienic \(they don't have to touch anything\), so this behavior is unlikely to disappear over time.
1.6.13.5.3.3.12. Con: [Several studies](http://healthybodylife.com/932-mens-rooms-cleaner-womens-rooms/) refuted the myth that females' bathrooms are more sanitary. In fact, the opposite is the case: As women sit \(normally\) down to use the toilet, it is more likely that they transport and spread germs to other bathrooms.
1.6.13.5.3.3.12.1. Pro: [A study](https://www.ciriscience.org/a_67-Enteric-Bacterial-Contamination-of-Public-Restrooms) testing 47 forty-seven public restrooms for bacterial contamination found out that females' bathrooms were 4.5 times more likely to contain ecoli bacteria.
1.6.13.5.3.4. Con: Whereas trans individuals have to face discrimination and outright hostility as of now, unisex bathrooms would result "merely" in discomfort for others. This is a matter of degree.
1.6.13.6. Pro: The struggle for reforming transgender individuals' access to bathrooms stands [in line](http://time.com/3974186/transgender-bathroom-debate/) with the civil rights struggle for equal bathroom access that other groups experienced, for example blacks, women and the handicapped.
1.6.13.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.3.4.2.
1.6.13.7. Pro: In the status quo, no matter which bathroom they choose to use, transgender individuals face backlash or even violence. This policy's approach removes that fear and threat.
1.6.13.8. Pro: Gender-separated bathrooms are a constant reminder for transgender individuals who have not yet come out that they are forced into a role they'd rather not play.
1.6.13.8.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.
1.6.14. Pro: The deliberate absence of definitive gender labels causes unisex bathrooms to be all-inclusive and therefore prevents discrimination against non-binary or transgender identities.
1.6.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.
1.7. Pro: Unisex bathrooms have proven to work in many areas, thus it seems only right to adopt them on a larger scale in public.
1.7.1. Con: Unisex restrooms only work in areas where they are culturally accepted.
1.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.13.5.3.1.
1.7.1.2. Con: This argument leads into a "chicken or the egg"-dilemma. Maybe unisex bathrooms should only be implemented once they are accepted - but maybe their acceptance requires that they are first implemented for acceptance to follow.
1.7.1.3. Pro: In strictly religious spaces such as churches and mosques, it may be impossible to implement unisex bathrooms due to religious beliefs.
1.7.1.3.1. Con: Many religious groups would have no problem with unisex toilets; indeed, some groups \(such as Quakers\) may even actively encourage it.
1.7.1.3.2. Con: Although exceptions could be made for religious groups where it is considered that there would be a clear and adverse impact from the adoption of unisex bathrooms in their place of worship, religious institutions should not be automatically exempt from the rules that govern other public spaces.
1.7.2. Pro: Portable restrooms are already usually unisex, and this doesn't seem to contribute to anyone's discomfort with using them.
1.7.2.1. Con: The threat that possible unisex bathrooms exacerbate, such as sexual assault, are not relevant in portable restrooms because they consist of only one cabin and not a restroom where male and female can mix. At large festivals, where lots of portable restrooms are used, they are often divided in a separate areas for men and women.
1.7.3. Pro: There are already many public places in which unisex bathrooms exist and are being accepted.
1.7.3.1. Pro: In a primary school in [Iceland](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/iceland-primary-school-introduces-gender-neutral-toilets-a6834916.html),Â unisex bathrooms were introduced to not force children into pre-made categories.
1.7.3.2. Pro: As of 2015, around 150 colleges and universities in the [US](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/21/yale-gender-neutral-bathrooms-transgender-rights) had incorporated unisex bathrooms into school policy.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: Compared to the total amount of 4,726 Title IV-eligible, degree-granting [institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_the_United_States) in the US, this is just a tiny fraction.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Unisex bathrooms have been introduced in bars all over [Beijing](http://www.chinadailyasia.com/nation/2016-06/15/content_15449354.html), indicating that there is no problem with or significant resistance towards them.
1.7.3.4. Pro: A Swedish museum has unisex bathrooms that, according to the [creative director](http://www.thelocal.se/20150416/swedish-museum-gets-gender-neutral-toilet-signs), help stimulate thoughts about how LGBTs felt during the age of Vikings.
1.7.3.5. Pro: In [Switzerland](http://genderneutraltoiletsch.blogspot.de/) there are plenty of unisex bathrooms all over the country.
1.7.3.6. Pro: Restrooms in airplanes, busses and trains are already gender-neutral. Thus, there is no reason that unisex bathrooms should not work in other public spheres.
1.7.3.6.1. Con: In airplanes, buses and trains, these bathrooms are there not necessarily because they are wholly successful and popular with the public, but due to space restrictions on public transport.
1.7.3.6.1.1. Con: They are at least successful enough that not having them is not worth the extra space an extra bathroom would occupy.
1.7.3.6.2. Con: Unlike common unisex bathrooms, airplanes, buses and trains have single-room bathrooms that are not shared simultaneously.
1.7.3.7. Con: If unisex bathrooms were already a commonality beyond exceptions, their introduction would not be met with the current outcry and debate.
1.7.3.7.1. Con: Even social realities that have become common can be met with outcry and debate. Most countries have abolished the death penalty, yet parts of the US are vehemently attached to it.
1.7.4. Pro: Unisex restrooms are hardly a novelty. Virtually every family home, hotel room, and many restaurants and offices get by with shared one-room bathrooms.
1.7.4.1. Pro: In private households it is absolutely common for men and women to use the same bathroom. There is no restroom segregation in private, thus there is no need for it in public either.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: You cannot compare private to public. Sharing a restroom with close family members is totally different than with strangers.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Con: Even in public, there are some places with communal sinks.
1.7.4.1.1.2. Con: When throwing a party or inviting people to dinner, strangers of the opposite sex will be using the same restroom as well.
1.7.4.1.1.2.1. Con: In the average household, there is only one toilet in a restroom, so it is only shared consecutively and not simultaneously.
1.7.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The toilet cubicle iteself will only be shared consecutively in public as well.
1.7.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Bathrooms in private homes usually consist of walled-off, individual toilets, not merely rooms with a number of toilet stalls or urinals with some form of screen in-between.
1.7.4.1.1.3. Pro: In private people can choose which persons they give access to the restroom, whereas in public literally everybody has free access.
1.7.4.1.2. Con: Bathrooms in private homes usually separate people from each other \(and from seeing and hearing each other\) to a higher degree than public bathrooms.
1.7.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.7.4.1.2.2. Con: There are [single](http://www.exeloo.com/) room public restrooms as well.
1.7.4.1.2.3. Con: At least the seeing part is not an issue, as public bathrooms offer "seats" as well, which are behind "walls".
1.7.4.1.2.3.1. Con: The US is [infamous](https://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/2526mc/why_do_bathroom_stalls_in_north_america_and/) for the [large gaps](https://www.buzzfeed.com/robinedds/i-can-see-you?utm_term=.mb09gZZaq#.ccEaozzPm) around the doors of its public bathroom stalls and [separating walls](http://www.dispenser.com/blog/organizedbath/european-vs-american-bathrooms/) that reach neither to the ceiling nor the floor. Usually, neither of these is an issue in private bathrooms.
1.7.4.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Floor-to-ceiling design toilets prevent feelings of discomfort and lack of privacy.
1.7.4.1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Bathroom stalls in many places - and [especially in the US](https://www.buzzfeed.com/robinedds/i-can-see-you?utm_term=.hdNqj4dVj6#.fcDDV2YZV0) - suffer from large gaps in the walls and around doors that harm privacy.
1.7.4.1.2.3.1.2. Con: If there is a flaw with the current design of public restrooms, that should be addressed, but it should be addressed independently of this question.
1.7.4.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.2.3.1.
1.7.4.1.2.5. Con: Some public or semipublic \(fast food restaurants\) bathrooms offer the same experience as at home.
1.7.4.1.2.5.1. Pro: Fast food restaurants offer full cabin experiences.
1.7.4.1.2.5.2. Pro: Bathrooms at train stations offer fully closable cabins.
1.7.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.1.2.
1.7.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.1.2.1.
1.7.4.2. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.2.
1.7.5. Con: The fact that unisex bathrooms are present only in certain areas of social life might be an indication that they do not work or are not accepted beyond these contexts.
1.7.5.1. Con: This may equally be an indication that society is in the process of switching to universal, unisex bathrooms, and that those areas are the easiest, or most readily-accepted, place to start.
1.7.5.2. Con: There is no evidence that this is the reason for unisex bathrooms' existence in only specific areas.
1.7.5.3. Pro: Even where unisex bathrooms are available, this is usually the result of considerations about practicality and not any social agenda.
1.7.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.6.1.
1.7.6. Con: This is the fallacy of composition. Just because something is true in part, does not mean it is true of the whole. For example, public restrooms are accessible to a broader range of people you don't know than a home or office bathroom.
1.7.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.2.
1.7.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.1.
1.7.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.1.2.1.
1.7.6.4. Con: -> See 1.7.3.
1.8. Con: A significant part of society opposes unisex bathrooms.
1.8.1. Con: Major issues influenced by the instigation of unisex bathrooms - such as human safety, comfort and everyday efficiency - cannot be simply disregarded in favour of a majority opinion.
1.8.2. Con: Education campaigns need to be implemented to raise awareness and acceptability of unisex bathrooms.
1.8.2.1. Con: Social agreement or acceptance should already exist before awareness or education campaigns regarding new laws are presented. Law and funding for education campaigns in opposition to social norms should not pre-empt social change.
1.8.3. Con: Unisex bathrooms should not be considered anything other than normal, seeing as your household's bathroom is already gender-neutral.
1.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.
1.8.4. Con: If the current paradigm were to have unisex bathrooms, implementing legislation against them would be strongly criticised according to the vision that most now have of gender equality. Gendered bathrooms do not align with today's progressive views.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.3.4.
1.8.6. Con: Many people have never used a unisex public bathroom. If you are opposed to them in principal there is a very good chance that just experiencing one would put many of your fears and objections to rest.
1.8.7. Pro: In some places such as this UK [school](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2086007/Parents-anger-Hartlepool-school-builds-unisex-toilets-pupils.html), parents were angered about unisex bathrooms.
1.8.7.1. Con: To the same extent, parents of [transgender children](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2016/06/03/parents-of-transgender-child-our-magnetic-5-year-old-is-not-a-threat-to-anyone/)Â welcome such changes.
1.8.7.2. Con: If one thinks a certain institution is unacceptable for their children because of unisex restrooms, they are free to send the children to schools where there are gender separated restrooms.
1.8.7.2.1. Con: In many countries and regions \(e.g. [45%](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2016/03/01/can-you-choose-where-your-child-goes-to-school-how-u-s-school-districts-stack-up/) of American school districts\) parents cannot decide which school their children attend, and thus what kind of bathrooms they encounter.
1.8.7.2.2. Con: If this was implemented as a national policy, which is what we are debating the merit of, this would be impracticable, if not impossible.
1.8.7.2.3. Con: This puts an undue burden on those families.
1.8.7.2.4. Con: This undermines the right of people who disagree with this policy to be heard.
1.8.7.3. Con: Lots of people were angered by mixed race schools. The public's anger is insufficient to determine morality.
1.8.8. Pro: Churches in the [US](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/08/03/100-pastors-tell-ohio-schools-ignore-transgender-bathroom-mandate/87996882/) condemn the introduction of unisex bathrooms.
1.8.8.1. Con: The bible doesn't say anything about unisex bathrooms.
1.8.8.1.1. Con: [Leviticus 15:19-30](https://www.openbible.info/topics/menstruation) speaks about the uncleanliness of women during menstruation. Uncleanliness can be transferred to anyone who touches what a menstruating woman sits upon. This would be applicable to bathroom areas.
1.8.8.2. Con: Churches in the US are highly decentralized and exhibit great differences. 100 pastors from one region, as cited above, do not speak for the churches of the US as a whole.
1.8.8.3. Con: The US is allegedly a [secular](https://www.au.org/resources/publications/is-america-a-christian-nation) state, meaning that religious views should not sway national policies.
1.8.9. Con: Unisex bathrooms are approved by political actors. Thus, in some communities, they do not create anger in society.
1.8.9.1. Con: The New York legislation is only applicable to [single-stall bathrooms](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-lgbt-idUSKCN0Z72XX) and therefore not comparable to full-blown unisex bathrooms.
1.8.9.2. Con: Legislation does not equal public approval and acceptance.
1.8.9.3. Con: Equally, there are political actors that oppose of transgender individuals using whatever bathroom they see fit for themselves, for example inÂ [North Carolina](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/diane-ravitch/that-dumb-bathroom-bill-in-north-carolina_b_9756892.html).
1.8.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.4.
1.8.10. Con: In countries like the United States, [about as many](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-poll-americans-divided-over-transgender-bathroom-laws-supreme-court/) people are supportive of trans individuals freely choosing bathrooms as are opposed to it. There is thus no reason to emphasize the public opposition over the support on these issues.
1.8.10.1. Con: There is a huge difference between allowing trans people to choose which bathroom they want to use in accordance with their lived gender identity, and forcing all women to use the same bathroom as men.
1.8.11. Pro: Unisex bathrooms, in addition to male and female, would solve this issue.
1.8.11.1. Pro: It may be a good way to slowly transition to the goal of 100% unisex bathrooms, if there is a lot of opposition to do it in one go. If people see that unisex bathrooms do not lead to big problems, and they get used to it, it may be easier to eventually get rid of sex-specific bathrooms.
1.8.11.2. Con: In many places it will be impossible to simply add a third category of bathrooms, for example due to a lack of space.
1.8.12. Con: Whether or not they oppose it is distinct from whether they have good reason to. The point of debates such as this one is to ground opposition or approval of claims in further reasons, rather than allow existing opposition or approval to serve as a self-justifying reason.
1.9. Pro: It is more efficient to have one large bathroom than two smaller ones.
1.9.1. Pro: It would be easier to locate a public bathroom if every single one was by default unisex: this would alleviate the common problem of finding a bathroom of the opposite gender, then having to track down the "correct" bathroom, which might be on the opposite side of a building.
1.9.2. Pro: Having one unisex bathroom in place of two segregated bathrooms is more time-efficient for users.
1.9.2.1. Pro: In buildings with gendered bathrooms, one can be full, yet the other empty. By making them all unisex, this issue can be avoided, increasing the availability to more people.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: The lines at women's rooms are almost always longer than the lines at men's rooms. If we implement gender-neutral bathrooms, we could eliminate this inequality.
1.9.2.1.1.1. Con: The problem of female bathrooms being generally busier could equally be avoided by simply providing female bathroom facilities with more toilets than male ones.
1.9.2.1.1.2. Con: Most male toilets only have one or two cubicles, so it is unclear how unisex toilets would help. The men's queue is smaller because urinals are faster; forcing men into cubicles would make things slower.
1.9.2.1.1.2.1. Con: There are urinals in unisex bathrooms.
1.9.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Quite a few unisex bathrooms in German cities, e.g. [Frankfurt](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bild.de%2Fregional%2Ffrankfurt%2Ffrankfurt-aktuell%2Firrer-klo-zoff-an-goethe-uni-40968134.bild.html&sl=de&tl=en&hl=de&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools), [Darmstadt](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asta.tu-darmstadt.de%2Fasta%2Fde%2Faktuelles%2FUnisex-Resolution-StuPa&sl=de&tl=en&hl=de&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools) and [Marbug](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.op-marburg.de%2FUNIversum%2FUni-und-Stadt%2FAsta-Referat-will-Unisex-Toiletten&sl=de&tl=en&hl=de&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools), include at least one urinal or are planned with a section with urinals.
1.9.2.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Unisex bathrooms in [Switzerland](http://genderneutraltoiletsch.blogspot.de/) have urinals.
1.9.2.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: [Drafts](http://kxan.com/2016/05/24/alamo-drafthouse-seeks-feedback-on-gender-neutral-bathroom-design/) for unisex bathrooms include a section of urinals behind one door and individual stalls for seated toilets.
1.9.2.1.1.2.1.4. Con: Assuming only those with penises can use urinals, but anyone can use a stall, this effectively makes more resources available to males, to the detriment of those who can only use a stall.
1.9.2.1.1.2.2. Con: The urinals are only faster by the amount of time it takes to flush and that time is negligable.
1.9.2.1.1.3. Con: Women wait in front of cabins, while men generally use pissoirs more often. Thus, there is no gender equalizing effect on waiting time.
1.9.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Pissoirs are faster than cabins. \(So, the disproportionately large availability of cabins to pissoirs, from freeing up the unused mens cabins, would balance out the cabins' lower efficiency and bring usage per gender closer to equal.\)
1.9.2.1.1.4. Con: A shared restroom would need to be as big as the current separated restrooms combined. Otherwise the shared restroom would be jammed with long lines waiting.
1.9.2.1.1.5. Pro: The Journal of Urology 2005 found that women urinate [more](http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/story?id=2542099&page=1) often than men.
1.9.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: Women generally need to urinate more often because of their[biology](http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/story?id=2542099&page=1): men have a larger bladder capacity, and women's anatomy means they are more likely to suffer from conditions that lead to more frequent urination, such as OBS, UTIs or pregnancy.
1.9.2.1.1.6. Con: Urinals take up less space than stalls, meaning that men's restrooms are more efficient than unisex bathrooms - especially single-occupancy ones - would be.
1.9.2.1.1.6.1. Con: While male anatomy allows for more efficient urination, this does not justify having differences in waiting times between bathrooms. It would still be both more efficient and more equitable if bathrooms were shared and all genders were waiting in a single queue.
1.9.2.1.1.6.1.1. Con: A man in the back of the line behind a few women would not know if a urinal was open if the line ran all the way out of the restroom.
1.9.2.1.1.7. Pro: Theorists at Ghent University found that shared toilet facilities would reduce queuing time by [63%](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/829816/toilet-queue-women-unisex-bathroom-gender-transgender-slash) for women.
1.9.2.1.2. Pro: If a venue serves a mostly-male crowd some days and a mostly-female crowd other days, then gendered restrooms will mean long lines at the restroom of the most represented gender and at the same time empty stalls in the restroom of the least represented gender.
1.9.2.1.2.1. Con: There are few instances in which a given venue would frequently serve crowds heavy in one gender in particular \(unless it was made for this purpose\). It would therefore not be worth the time and expense required to make male/female restrooms unsegregated on this basis.
1.9.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Even if the occasions on which crowds are of mainly one gender are rare, it makes sense to unsegregate bathrooms for them. One event at a given venue may last a few hours; if, of these few hours, half an hour to an hour is spent queueing for a single-sex/gender bathroom, the inconvenience is proportionately large enough to warrant creating bathrooms open to all.
1.9.2.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.9.2.1.1.2.1.
1.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.1.1.
1.9.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.1.2.
1.9.2.4. Con: Demand spikes happen simultaneously for men and women's bathrooms in most circumstances, reducing the efficiency gain from a single, common resource.
1.9.3. Pro: Having one unisex bathroom in place of two segregated bathrooms would be more cost-effective.
1.9.3.1. Pro: Having only one restroom saves space and money because facilities, such as toilet cabins or sinks, can be shared.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.9.2.1.1.4.
1.9.3.2. Con: -> See 1.8.2.
1.9.3.3. Con: A law that allows anyone to enter both formerly gendered bathrooms would be much cheaper than rebuilding all the existing bathrooms.
1.9.3.3.1. Pro: Gendered bathrooms are not always located next to each other in public buildings, so forming one unisex bathroom from two gendered ones would not always be a case of knocking through a dividing wall.
1.9.3.3.2. Con: This would impinge on womenâs safety.
1.9.3.3.2.1. Con: Women aren't weak little wall flowers, as this treatment, and justification imply, and treating people like they are unable to do things, like say protect themselves, teaches them that this is the truth, even when it isn't, and justifies shutting down any aspect of their individuality, or independence [www.npr.org](https://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/378577902/how-to-become-batman)
1.9.3.3.3. Con: Stalls are a requirement if the unisex bathrooms are to work. Just letting women walk into a room full of urinals is likely to be uncomfortable for both genders.
1.9.3.3.3.1. Con: It is uncomfortable for men to walk into rooms full of urinals being used, and for the men using them to have other men walk in on them for the same reason.
1.9.3.4. Con: Converting all restrooms to unisex restrooms could create unnecessary expenses, including the cost of removal of urinals or building stalls around urinals.
1.9.3.4.1. Con: It takes [little to no funding](http://transwellness.org/resources/educational-materials/gender-neutral-bathrooms/) to transform gender-separated restrooms into unisex bathrooms.
1.9.3.4.1.1. Con: The link provided to support this claim talks about adding gender neutral restrooms alongside gendered restrooms. This is clearly more expensive than not adding gender neutral restrooms.
1.9.3.4.1.2. Pro: Existing restrooms need regular renovation, thus implementing a makeover towards gender neutrality would not become as expensive because follow-up costs occur there anyway.
1.9.3.4.2. Con: We could give existing structures a generous time to comply with this new regulation, allowing it to be phased in with new building, and reconstruction that was likely to occur regardless.
1.9.3.4.3. Con: Unisex bathrooms don't need to have urinals removed
1.9.4. Con: The only efficiency gain is not having to construct a dividing wall.  A large restroom serving twice as many people will require as much plumbing and as many fixtures as two small restrooms.
1.9.5. Con: Two bathrooms are more efficient when it comes to cleaning. In case of a single unisex bathroom, closing it for the purpose of cleaning means that no one can use the bathroom anymore. If separate bathrooms exist, they are usually cleaned one after the other. Thus, if only one bathroom is closed at a time, members of the other gender can still use their bathroom.
1.9.5.1. Con: Even separated bathrooms are often cleaned while in use. If there are bathroom stalls, this is not an issue.
1.9.6. Con: This is only true if there is efficient entry/exit/design of the restroom itself.
1.10. Con: Unisex bathrooms make many people extremely uncomfortable with using public restrooms.
1.10.1. Pro: People have a right to be uncomfortable with something they don't deem appropriate. It could be considered wrong to force someone to do an act in public they are not comfortable with such as going to the bathroom with someone of the opposite gender in the room.
1.10.1.1. Con: Following the logic of the parent - we would also have to question gender-separated bathrooms that don't strictly separate individuals from each other
1.10.2. Con: The problems that unisex bathrooms might cause could be solved or mitigated by designing them in an appropriate way. Cubicles with lockable doors can ensure privacy and prevent discomfort as well as harassment in public bathrooms.
1.10.2.1. Pro: In addition, bathrooms with cubicles could have see-through walls between the areas outside the cubicles and the building's communal space, e.g. a restaurant or office. That way, safety issues beyond the cubicles could also be avoided.
1.10.2.2. Pro: Enclosed stalls would/could mirror the single occupant bathroom experience.
1.10.2.3. Pro: Gendered bathrooms are only maintained via societal convention, which means little is actually stopping a determined harasser from following them.
1.10.2.4. Con: Making all restrooms single cubical rooms would incur greater cost and difficulty of design, particularly in venues that deal with large crowds, such as stadiums.
1.10.2.5. Con: Women use bathrooms for more than just toileting \(which may already be considered embarrassing due to smells and sounds\). Bathrooms may be used for showering, a private space for repairing an outfit, recovering from sickness, attending to sanitary leaks and stains, and preparing to look presentable in public. This privacy would be hindered by the presence of males.
1.10.2.6. Con: The feeling of discomfort is not confined to the stall: it is also present at the sink or urinal.
1.10.2.6.1. Pro: Many females would not feel comfortable with males observing them while they put on their makeup.
1.10.2.6.1.1. Con: Since most makeup being done in public bathrooms is minor touch-ups, and many women are comfortable doing so with only a compact mirror, this claim isn't incredibly strong. Women who are uncomfortable applying makeup in a specific space will find alternative spaces to apply their makeup.
1.10.2.6.2. Con: People of all genders use sinks together in other situations without it being uncomfortable or awkward.
1.10.2.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.1.
1.10.2.6.3. Con: Sinks and sanitary facilities could be in well-designed, larger cubicles.
1.10.2.7. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.10.3. Pro: The act of going to the restroom makes many people already feel vulnerable, unsafe and exposed. Forcing people to share public restrooms with the opposite sex very likely increases this situation.
1.10.3.1. Con: If a person is to busy noticing who is around them to do their business anyway, who they notice isn't going to make much of a difference.
1.10.3.2. Con: Many people go to public bathrooms co-occupied by blood relatives without issue.
1.10.3.3. Pro: The '[shy bladder syndrome](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/shy-bladder-syndrome)' is one of the most common types of social phobia. Affected individuals feel anxious and vulnerable in restrooms, and find it difficult or impossible to urinate when other people are around.
1.10.3.3.1. Con: People of the same gender cause the same effect, so it's unclear how unisex bathrooms would harm them.
1.10.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.13.5.3.3.
1.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.10.2.6.1.
1.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.6.13.5.3.2.
1.10.7. Pro: The number of people that will feel uncomfortable or unsafe in unisex bathrooms is much higher than the number of people that feel uncomfortable or unsafe in separate bathrooms.
1.10.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.5.
1.10.7.2. Con: In order to show the net positive or negative impact of two different policies in comparison to one another, it is not enough to simply make a comparison between the numbers of people harmed by them; the numbers of people helped by these policies, in comparison to the numbers harmed, is wholly necessary for this.
1.10.7.3. Con: According to multiple polls, [many](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/public-support-for-transgender-rights-a-twenty-three-country-survey/) [people](https://www.hrc.org/blog/new-hrc-poll-improving-favorability-toward-transgender-people) [support](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/americans-are-embracing-transgender-rights/497444/) transgender rights. It seems therefore unlikely that they would oppose unisex bathrooms that help to defend these rights.
1.10.7.3.1. Con: Many people might defend other peoples' rights where it does not affect themselves - for example when it comes to gay marriage - but oppose them once they are affected, as would be the case with unisex bathrooms.
1.10.7.3.2. Pro: Presumably, given the small number of people who identify as trans, the vast majority of these people are cisgendered.
1.10.8. Pro: Unisex bathrooms will introduce conflict between individuals of opposite sex. When a person exposes one's genitalia, regardless of purpose, and this act is observed by a person of the opposite sex, this act fits under a legal definition of indecent exposure and can result in criminal prosecution.
1.10.8.1. Con: If one must expose their genitals to the pubic to relive themselves, then this is a violation of privacy rights, and the structure must be built properly to defend them.
1.10.8.2. Con: Individuals in bathrooms - and especially in bathrooms that contain primarily stalls - usually do not expose their genitalia to anyone else.
1.10.8.3. Con: Indecent exposure laws [typically require](https://advance.lexis.com/documentpage/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=a675f118-3cd3-42bc-b8f8-5e938bb62ba3&config=014FJAAyNGJkY2Y4Zi1mNjgyLTRkN2YtYmE4OS03NTYzNzYzOTg0OGEKAFBvZENhdGFsb2d592qv2Kywlf8caKqYROP5&pddocfullpath=%2fshared%2fdocument%2fstatutes-legislation%2furn%3acontentItem%3a5PC1-8380-004D-109S-00008-00&pddocid=urn%3acontentItem%3a5PC1-8380-004D-109S-00008-00&pdcontentcomponentid=234176&pdteaserkey=sr0&pditab=allpods&ecomp=g3J_kkk&earg=sr0&prid=e5cdf8a2-b6dc-472a-bf81-48b66b1ce211) more than exposure "regardless of purpose," and typically do not require that the suspect and victim be of opposite genders. Unisex bathrooms are no different in terms of indecent exposure laws than segregated bathrooms.
1.10.9. Con: Understandings of comfort and discomfort are socially constructed and can evolve. Over time, people would get used to unisex bathrooms.
1.10.9.1. Pro: The existing separation of bathrooms by gender is [a social construction in itself](http://time.com/4337761/history-sex-segregated-bathrooms/) and has - historically speaking - nothing to do with biological necessities. Thus, there is no reason why this institution cannot be socially de-constructed once again.
1.10.9.2. Pro: There are many things that society would not have been "comfortable" with in the past that have now been implemented in all or many areas of the world \(monarchy-less states, slave-free societies, integrated schools\); now, the general public would feel extremely uncomfortable at the idea of reinstating such policies.
1.10.9.3. Pro: People feel discomfort with unisex bathrooms, because they are not "normal". As normality is tightly connected to daily percipience, this feeling of discomfort will vanish, once the unisex bathrooms are established and a part of people's daily routine.
1.10.9.4. Con: Changes to the understanding of comfort are not without creating initial discomfort for some. Thus, unisex bathrooms will cause discomfort.
1.10.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.
1.10.9.5. Con: Even though understandings of comfort and discomfort are a social construction \(basically everything is a product of social construction and convention\), this does not mean that they inevitably will or should change, or that people would get used to unisex bathrooms.
1.10.9.6. Pro: Comfort and discomfort are anything but fixed realities. People are getting more comfortable with homosexuality, for example. Public attitudes [are changing](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/) and the disgust that is often [associated](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=SrFiAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=homophobia+disgust&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGzJXs07PNAhVDHZQKHQtaBhIQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=homophobia%20disgust&f=false) to homophobia is vanishing in many places.
1.10.9.6.1. Pro: Disgust [has been characterized](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=BxSMGjkLbyoC&pg=PA56&dq=disgust+social+construction&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwic2rLu087NAhWFnZQKHVcdBWsQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q=disgust%20social%20construction&f=false) as a social construction that is specific to cultural contexts. Just as many instances of what counts as disgusting have to be learned, they can be de-constructed and thus un-learned.
1.10.10. Con: The fact you might share an area where both sexes use the toilet, wash their hands, check their hair and apply makeup does not add to the awkwardness compared to a segregated restroom experience.
1.10.11. Con: -> See 1.7.2.
1.10.12. Con: Many people \(especially those who are transgender or gender-nonconforming\) are uncomfortable with using sex-segregated restrooms.
1.10.13. Pro: Washrooms are often a place people go to avoid someone of the opposite sex who is making them feel unsafe. In environments such as bars, having a room where there are no men makes women feel safer: it provides an escape where they cannot be as easily followed by potentially predatory men.
1.10.13.1. Con: Restrooms could achieve gender neutrality without sacrificing individual privacy and/or safety. For instance, rather than having "men's" and "women's" restrooms, public spaces could have "locked" and "unlocked" restrooms. "Locked" restrooms could be used by either gender in situations where privacy \(or momentary escape\) is required.
1.10.13.2. Con: I can't imagine that the proposed unisex bathroom would not have a locking door. Not to mention, many public, gender-specific bathrooms are large rooms with no lock containing smaller, very accessible stalls. A single locking room would actually be safer in this instance if that was a concern.
1.10.13.3. Con: There is nothing to imply that a unisex bathroom wouldn't have locks on the doors or individual stalls with locks. The idea that a bathroom door without a lock provides any type of safety from anybody of any gender would be a bit of a stretch.
1.10.13.4. Con: There are already two ways of avoiding harassment: 1\) staying in public where others can provide support, or 2\) locking oneself in a private place, such as a home. If you truly need a public place with privacy, gender segregation has nothing to do with it. You would still have toilet stalls.
1.10.13.5. Con: Unisex bathrooms promote equality, and thus may have the long term effect of discouraging the sexualization and commodification of the female body that makes men feel a right to come so strong as to threaten your safety.
1.10.13.6. Con: Harassment isn't limited to people of the opposite gender. So the ability to use a washroom to "escape" harassment works only if the harasser is of the opposite gender.
1.10.13.6.1. Con: So the "escape" does not work all the time for everybody, but it's still a good solution for many people at many times. To use an analogy: seat belts won't always save your life in a car crash, but that doesn't mean we should take them away from our cars.
1.10.13.6.1.1. Con: Seatbelts are not an excuse for not having airbags, any if airbags would prevent any injury seatbelts would, there would be no reason to have seatbelts. In this case, restrooms designed around actual safety, and privacy are analogous to airbags.
1.10.13.6.1.2. Con: It has not been shown that this 'escape' is actually effective at all.
1.10.13.7. Con: That problem needs to be solved by addressing the womenâs safety \(and equally menâs safety\) and not by providing hiding spaces.
1.10.13.8. Con: -> See 1.4.4.4.
1.10.13.9. Con: The view of a restroom as a safe space is a response to available tools in a given situation and not related to the use and function of a restroom.
1.11. Con: Public restrooms have always been segregated by gender.
1.11.1. Con: Gendered public restrooms actually [didn't see commonality until the 19th century](http://reason.com/archives/2014/04/11/gender-neutral-bathrooms-building-codes), as a way to accommodate women who worked or otherwise spent large amounts of time in public. Before then, it was societal convention, though not always law, that public restrooms were to only be used by men.
1.11.2. Con: Many smaller establishments have uni-sex bathrooms, although they are only to be used by one person at a time.
1.11.3. Con: Things should not simply continue to be done a certain way, just because that is the way they have been done in the past; improvement does not occur through unquestioning adherence to norms.
1.11.4. Con: The first restrooms were separated due to [now-antiquated views](http://time.com/4337761/history-sex-segregated-bathrooms/) on women's place in society. The continued existence of segregated bathrooms thus risks maintaining this form of embedded sexism.
1.11.5. Con: While gender separate bathrooms have long existed, the notion of them being a protection and a necessity stems from the Victorian era's [Separate Spheres philosophy](https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://en.wikipedia.org/&httpsredir=1&article=1067&context=mjgl).
1.11.6. Con: In many smaller bars and restaurants in Europe, unisex restrooms are normal and always have been.
1.11.7. Pro: The [first ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unisex_public_toilet#History) public toilets were gender-segregated, and were assembled in 1739 for a ball in Paris.
1.11.7.1. Con: Unisex washrooms existed long before this. This is just the first example of a segregated toilet, not the first public toilet.
1.11.8. Pro: Gender segregated restrooms have proven themselves to be the best available way to build toilets. Thus, they should be kept.
1.11.8.1. Con: -> See 1.9.2.1.
1.11.8.2. Pro: Sections for disabled in public toilets are already gender neutral in many cases. There is no need for a general overhaul when a facility already provides for it. Adding a sticker with a gender neutral sign to the third section does the job.
1.11.8.2.1. Con: This would deny transgender individuals the recognition as female or male - which many of them considers themselves as - and thus discriminate against them by putting them into a special category.
1.11.8.2.1.1. Con: It is especially this arrangement that leaves them their recognition of male or female because separate gender stalls will still be available.
1.11.8.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.1.1.1.
1.11.8.2.3. Con: If the sections for the disabled are instead treated as being clearly open for everyone, it will become much harder for the disabled to use the toilets.
1.11.8.3. Pro: Signs for unisex bathroomsÂ are creating problems.
1.11.8.3.1. Pro: The arrows of a design in [Sweden](https://www.rt.com/news/232083-unisex-toilets-sweden-visiotors/) are confusing.
1.11.8.3.2. Pro: There are [too many](https://www.buzzfeed.com/skarlan/17-of-the-most-fabulous-gender-neutral-bathroom-signs?utm_term=.egM0QWDXm#.gsDdQD9YB) possible designs in use for unisex bathrooms. This prevents the development of globally unified symbolic meanings.
1.11.8.3.2.1. Pro: Globally unified symbolic meanings are necessary to create a place that is the same all over the world; a [non-place](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jread2/Auge%20Non%20places.pdf). Without it unisex bathroomsÂ have significant difficulties to become globally accepted.
1.11.8.3.2.2. Con: There are [plenty](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/06/06/what-should-be-the-restroom-sign-of-the-future/?utm_term=.1c8e3886ebd0) of clear, straightforward signs for unisex bathrooms.
1.11.8.3.2.3. Con: With the spread of unisex bathrooms the related symbolism would establish itself over time, just like the [Mars and Venus symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_symbol) did in the past for gender-specific bathrooms.
1.11.8.3.3. Con: If unisex bathroomsÂ were the norm, there would be no need for any signage beyond a universally-accepted symbol or the word "bathroom" anymore. Rather, only gender-specific bathrooms would require signage that goes beyond that.
1.11.8.3.4. Con: -> See 1.11.8.3.2.2.
1.11.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.11.8.5. Con: Gender segregated toilets as of now discriminate transgender people as well as people unsure of their gender in public by forcing them to make a \(sometimes impossible\) choice on a daily basis.
1.11.8.6. Con: Unisex bathrooms would require the installation of more toilet stalls with toilet bowls which are by far less water-efficient than [urinals](https://www.ecu.edu/cs-acad/sustainabletourism/upload/Water-Efficiency-for-Commerial-Bathrooms.pdf).
1.11.8.6.1. Con: -> See 1.9.2.1.1.2.1.
1.11.8.7. Con: Transgender individuals tend to avoid gender-separated public bathrooms, which in many cases leads toÂ physical problems such as dehydration andÂ urinary tract infections, according to [a study](http://search.proquest.com/docview/1439085659?pq-origsite=gscholar).
1.11.8.8. Con: The same argument could be applied to racially segregated bathrooms.
1.11.8.9. Con: -> See 1.4.4.4.5.4.1.1.
1.12. Pro: Unisex bathrooms benefit many groups.
1.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.
1.12.2. Pro: Unisex bathrooms are necessary for non-binary people who identify as neither male nor female.
1.12.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.12.3. Pro: Parents of older children with disabilities that are not instantly recognizable, yet who still need or benefit from assistance in the bathroom would benefit. With segregated bathrooms it's difficult to assist a older child of the opposite gender without risking confrontation.
1.12.4. Pro: If there was only one restroom, nobody would ever have to deal with accidentally going into the wrong restroom again.
1.12.5. Pro: Unisex public restrooms could solve a number of problems, including the discomfort many feel with current lack of privacy from flimsy, inadequate stall partitions. With the space saved by only having one restroom area, designers must make toilets and urinals much more completely enclosed and private than they are now. Walls and doors must extend to the floor with no cracks.
1.12.6. Pro: We all need the same equipment in the bathroom: sink & toilet. These items don't need to be gender-specific. More places should opt to use single stall bathrooms, which also help people with disabilities, people who need privacy for medical needs, and parents who need to support their children.
1.12.7. Con: -> See 1.6.13.5.3.1.
1.12.8. Con: The primary group it would benefit is transexuals, therefore it is not justifiable to impose their preference on all the other groups who may feel uncomfortable with the idea of sharing the bathroom with opposite sexes.
1.12.9. Pro: All genders will have same access to baby changing tables which are commonly found in women's public restrooms.
1.12.9.1. Con: This can simply be solved by adding changing tables in more men's facilities as well.
1.12.9.1.1. Con: This duplicates resources unnecessarily; the demand for changing tables is not high enough to justify this in many places.
1.12.9.1.1.1. Con: Society cannot change everything for a small minority of people
1.12.9.1.1.1.1. Con: if we do not make changes for what seems like a minority at first in any given aspect of our communities, stereotypes become ever more fixed, and no social change could ever be brought about.
1.12.9.1.1.1.2. Con: it is unjust not to make changes on the basis that only a minority want them.
1.12.9.1.1.2. Con: If the demand is not high enough to justify placing them in both male and female facilities, then clearly there was no problem in the first place.
1.12.9.1.1.2.1. Con: That changing tables are primarily present in bathrooms for women is probably less a result of low demand and more of stereotypical assumptions about gender roles.
1.12.9.1.1.2.1.1. Con: If statistically speaking, [more women stay at home](http://healthland.time.com/2013/11/29/next-time-someone-tells-you-that-lots-of-dads-stay-home-too/) or [work less hours](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-average-hours-per-week-worked-in-the-us-2060631) to care for their family, then it only makes sense that women's restrooms would be more likely to have change tables because it's more likely that women will be out with their children instead of men. It's not a stereotypical assumption if it's true.
1.12.10. Pro: Unisex bathrooms would benefit the elderly, who might need assistance. As helpers may be of either gender, unisex bathrooms would make it easier and less embarrassing for the elderly to ask for help.
1.12.11. Pro: Parents of small children often must resort to taking small children of the opposite sex into gendered restrooms with them to avoid leaving them alone in public and/or because they require assistance. Unisex bathrooms would avoid any issues this may cause.
1.12.11.1. Pro: Gender separated bathrooms are not conducive to single parents or families that have children of more than one gender. They simply are inconvenient and it's much easier to be able to choose any bathroom that is available when you need it.
1.12.11.2. Pro: Family rooms are fine, people need to get over it. One bathroom to take care of is better. If each toilet would be lockable I don't see the issue.
1.12.11.3. Con: In unisex bathrooms, grown adults would be in the same restroom with children of the opposite gender, just as with gendered restrooms.
1.12.11.4. Con: Taking small children into a bathroom not intended for their sex is usually not considered problematic.
1.12.11.4.1. Con: Taking children who are visibly still infants into the 'opposite' bathroom is usually not an issue; however, the older the child gets, the stickier this becomes for all involved. All children develop differently and at different paces; the age at which parents feel comfortable allowing their child to go to a public bathroom unaccompanied also varies. Replacing male/female public bathrooms with just one bathroom open to all would avoid this issue entirely.
1.12.11.4.1.1. Pro: There are [innumerable](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=when+can+child+use+public+restroom+alone&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjH3LyE_Z_XAhVFGsAKHT33DdcQ1QIIaygA&biw=1412&bih=681) articles and posts on parenting forums agonising over the age at which it stops becoming socially acceptable for a parent to take their child of the opposite sex/gender into a public bathroom, and the answers can differ substantially according to individual circumstances.
1.12.11.4.2. Pro: It is unproblematic from a nudist perspective.
1.12.11.4.3. Con: In many places, boys from the age of 6 are [required](http://blogs.mom365.com/when-is-your-son-too-old-to-use-the-womens-restroom/) to use the men's room.
1.12.11.4.3.1. Pro: Those places may not be reliable indicators of public restroom morality.
1.12.12. Con: Though that may possibly be true, only one group \(transgender\) appears to demand unisex bathrooms. No other groups seem to be bothered or inconvenienced enough to actively support this for their benefit.
1.12.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.5.
1.12.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.
1.12.12.3. Con: -> See 1.10.7.3.
1.12.12.4. Con: Not being bothered enough to actively support is not the same as being opposed or even indifferent
1.13. Con: Unisex bathrooms may threaten peoples' safety and privacy.
1.13.1. Con: There is no such thing as a right to be segregated from people of another gender. You can't threaten a right that does not exist.
1.13.1.1. Con: While the right to separation of genders does not exist, each individual does have a right to their privacy, and to choose the environment in which their genitals may be exposed to other people. Because it is their own body that they have control over.
1.13.1.1.1. Con: This argument applies to changerooms, not restrooms. Modern unisex toilet facilities don't tend to be designed to facilitate the exposure of genitals deliberately or inadvertently.
1.13.1.1.2. Con: If anyone is forced to expose themselves in the process of any public function to anyone, something is not right. And if unisex facilities would have this problem, it means segregated ones already do.
1.13.2. Con: If all public restrooms were gender-neutral this would allow for people to focus on creating safer bathrooms.
1.13.3. Con: Gender neutral bathrooms [would be](http://time.com/4702962/gender-neutral-bathrooms/) [safer for those who do not conform to gender stereotypes](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/masen-davis/transgender-people-need-safe-restrooms_b_3492067.html).
1.13.4. Pro: There is a higher risk of individuals' privacy being violated by other immature, dangerous or perverted \("[Peeping Tom](http://www.christianexaminer.com/article/peeping-toms-lead-college-to-reconsider-gender-neutral-bathrooms/49680.htm)", pedophiles\) individuals in unisex bathrooms.
1.13.4.1. Con: Peeping can happen in gender [segregated](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/peeping-tom-records-teacher-bathroom-queens-elementary-article-1.3509313) bathrooms as well.
1.13.4.2. Con: Peeping-resistant toilets are easy to build and should be the standard for gender neutral as well as gender separated restrooms.
1.13.4.3. Pro: Unisex bathrooms provide twisted male minds easier access to women and children in compromising situations.
1.13.4.3.1. Con: Men already can, and [have](http://www.dailywire.com/news/4844/transgender-advocates-say-men-dressed-women-will-amanda-prestigiacomo), disguised themselves as women to gain access to female restrooms.
1.13.4.3.1.1. Con: Just because someone was caught doing this, it does not mean it's a common occurrence.
1.13.4.3.2. Pro: With gender-separated restrooms it arouses instant suspicion if a person hangs out around a bathroom designated for the opposite sex. With unisex bathrooms this would become a common situation that people with malicious intentions could easily take advantage of.
1.13.4.3.2.1. Con: There are statistically few cases of unisex bathrooms leading to sexual misconduct, and gendered bathrooms do nothing to prevent same-sex misconduct. If unisex bathrooms are normalized it will just be another place where men and women coexist, like any other place in our society.
1.13.4.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.13.4.3.1.
1.13.4.4. Con: Someone inclined to act as a voyeur or sexual harasser is just as likely to be comfortable entering a bathroom designated for the opposite gender.
1.13.4.4.1. Con: This is most likely not the case as entering a bathroom designed for the opposite gender instantly arouses the suspicion of onlookers and potential victims.
1.13.4.4.1.1. Con: This would only be the case if the bathroom was busy, which would likely prevent the sexual misconduct from occurring. If there are fewer people in the bathroom because only half the population is allowed there, it increases the likelihood that someone is in a situation where they can be assaulted.
1.13.4.4.1.2. Con: This is dependent on culture which can change over time and have subcultures where this is seen differently.
1.13.4.4.2. Pro: As unisex bathrooms do not separate by gender, it follows that they would be more busy than gendered facilities. This results in fewer situations in which a potential perpetrator and a potential victim are alone in a bathroom.
1.13.4.4.2.1. Con: It is unrealistic that the former two restrooms are combined into one and the other room remains unused. Therefore the two restrooms are kept, the visitors split like before and the user numbers stay basically the same.
1.13.4.4.2.1.1. Con: While this may be the case in the short term, in the longer term, new or renovated buildings will not have separate toilets to begin with. Owners of buildings will also look to re-purpose surplus space, and replace multiple bathrooms with one.
1.13.5. Con: -> See 1.13.4.4.2.
1.13.6. Con: Sometimes personal freedom should be prioritized over safety. Suggesting a people remain oppressed for their own good is a form of victim-blaming.
1.13.7. Con: There are many occasions where people of different gender, out of convenience, do not seek separate toilets.
1.13.7.1. Pro: It is common for individuals of all genders to share portapotties at festivals and other public events.
1.13.7.2. Con: The behaviour of excessively drunk people is not a valid standard.
1.13.8. Con: Women need female-only spaces in terms of dignity, privacy and safety. If there are to be unisex toilets, then by far the best and cheapest option is to make what are currently the men's toilets unisex and leave women's toilets female-only.
1.13.8.1. Con: a half hearted solution such as this not only doesn't solve anything at all, it would also be a case of blatantly illegal sexual discrimination.
1.13.8.2. Con: If there was a need for such a facility, there is no reason to believe a male counterpart would not also be necessary.
1.13.8.2.1. Con: I'd have to ask why given that men are not as prone to being assaulted and harassed as women are.
1.13.8.2.1.1. Con: What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
1.13.8.2.1.2. Con: The 14th amendment
1.13.8.2.1.3. Con: any semblance of equality
1.13.8.2.1.4. Con: it's not needed for women
1.13.8.2.1.5. Con: whatever reason you think it is needed for women
1.13.8.2.1.6. Con: the Civil Rights Act of 1964
1.13.8.3. Con: -> See 1.9.3.3.2.1.
1.13.8.4. Con: Women aren't fragile wall flowers incapable of dealing with the stresses of the world who need swooning rooms to guard them from the hardships of the oh so difficult world.
1.13.8.5. Con: -> See 1.9.3.3.3.
1.13.9. Pro: The right to dignity and safety for the few is more important than the casual convenience of the many.
1.13.10. Con: There are ways and means to ensure the safety of unisex bathrooms.
1.13.10.1. Pro: The most effective solution to safety and privacy issues in public bathrooms is surely to have unisex, [single-occupancy bathrooms](https://www.uua.org/lgbtq/welcoming/ways/bathrooms), rather than keeping gender-segregated bathrooms in their most common current form: partitioned cubicles in a single, multi-occupancy room.
1.13.10.1.1. Pro: This provides security and privacy, two areas of concern for both women and transgender individuals.
1.13.10.1.2. Con: -> See 1.9.2.1.1.6.
1.13.10.1.3. Con: Single occupancy public toilets would be very unpractical given the high amount of visitors.
1.13.10.2. Pro: Larger public toilets could have a warden or a cleaner who would ensure that such incidents do not occur and that people using these facilities feel safe.
1.13.10.2.1. Con: Bathroom personnel is not present everywhere - and certainly not around the clock.
1.13.10.2.1.1. Con: Bathroom personnel could be made more present if they were required to watch one restroom rather than two, and if it made people feel significantly safer.
1.13.10.3. Pro: These problems already exist in the design of separate bathrooms, which can be addressed \(and should be addressed anyway\) in the design phase of unisex bathrooms by having an open main area connecting different secure and privacy-optimized areas, such as toilets, a urinal section, and even private sink areas for an individual or group, if desired.
1.13.10.4. Pro: A bathroom with a working internal lock is perfectly safe. Port-A-Potties have always been unisex and there has never been a problem. We should do the same for public restrooms.
1.13.10.5. Pro: There are technological such as [scream detectors](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/05/116_205419.html) which can make bathrooms safer.
1.13.11. Con: Past experience with unisex bathrooms as well as empirical studies indicate that these fears are not warranted.
1.13.11.1. Pro: Seventeen school districts have reported [no incidents](https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2015/06/03/17-school-districts-debunk-right-wing-lies-abou/203867) after implementing transgender protections.
1.13.11.1.1. Con: The results were not numerical, rather they were based on statements that school representatives/authorities reported, which may have affected the reliability of the results.
1.13.11.1.2. Con: No reports of incidents does not necessarily equal no incidents. Victims of harassment in school or the workplace - as articles such as [this](https://www.newyorkcitydiscriminationlawyer.com/discrimination-against-transgender-individuals.html) outline - often do not report their maltreatment to their institution, fearing the attention and backlash that may occur as a result.
1.13.11.1.3. Con: The article linked is school administrators self-reporting on their policy to allow self-identified transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. It bears no evidence at all about all bathrooms being changed to unisex bathrooms, or transgender individuals' harassment in these.
1.13.11.1.4. Con: The absence of incidents in schools is not necessarily representative for society as a whole.
1.13.11.1.5. Pro: The method of reporting employed \(statements by school authorities\) shows that the outcome is an authoritative fact.
1.13.11.2. Pro: Unisex bathrooms are of no style of privacy or security issues, proven in numerous [studies](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/02/fears-gender-neutral-toilets-women-trans-people-violence).
1.13.11.3. Pro: People's fears of trans people - and supposedly 'fake' trans people - using unisex bathrooms to harass other users are unfounded. Many spokespeople, including those from the Transgender Law Centre, have confirmed there is [no data](https://mic.com/articles/114066/statistics-show-exactly-how-many-times-trans-people-have-attacked-you-in-bathrooms#.PVRoxzV52) or statistical evidence to suggest trans people behave inappropriately in public bathrooms and that they are used only for their intended purpose.
1.13.12. Con: Fears about sexual harassment and public safety are commonly not based on empirical realities.
1.13.12.1. Pro: In countries like the US, [a majority of citizens](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/16/voters-perceptions-of-crime-continue-to-conflict-with-reality/) believe that crime is getting worse or, at least, not getting better. Yet statistics show that crimes rates are decreasing.
1.13.13. Pro: Unisex bathrooms are especially problematic for those who might not be able to ensure their own privacy and that of others, for example by locking cubicle doors, because they have mental or physical disabilities.
1.13.14. Pro: Unisex bathrooms create [potential for](http://www.dailywire.com/news/4844/transgender-advocates-say-men-dressed-women-will-amanda-prestigiacomo) more sexual assault, and certainly more sexual harassment.
1.13.14.1. Con: -> See 1.13.4.4.2.
1.13.14.2. Con: Studies actually suggest that 'random' sexual abuse - such as that committed in public bathrooms - is relatively rare. One such [study](http://www.wcnc.com/news/politics/stats-show-assaults-dont-happen-in-bathrooms/126572739) interviewed 536 child victims of sexual abuse; only 2% had been abused by strangers, and the number of transgender bathroom assaults was zero.
1.13.14.2.1. Pro: Since sexual assault is more commonly [committed by someone known by the victim](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/perpetrators-sexual-violence) than by strangers, the bathroom in a standard family home is likely a more common location for sexual assault than public bathrooms.
1.13.14.3. Con: [Most](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/23/twenty-stories-proving-targets-pro-transgender-bathroom-policy-danger-women-children/) of the incidents cited that illustrate how allegedly unisex bathrooms lead to an increase in sexual harassment actually do not take place in unisex bathrooms but in regular bathrooms.
1.13.14.3.1. Con: Because regular public bathrooms far out number unisex public bathrooms, it is more common to have incidents in regular public bathrooms than in unisex bathrooms.
1.13.14.4. Pro: Unisex bathrooms provide rapists, abusers and stalkers easier access to potential victims.
1.13.14.4.1. Pro: In Canada, UK and USA, there has been an [increase in voyeurism, sexual harassment and sexual assault](https://sencanada.ca/content/sen/committee/421/LCJC/Briefs/WOMANMeanSome_e.pdf) in direct relation to such predators having access to gendered facilities normally restricted to their sex.
1.13.14.4.1.1. Con: The report says their were 255 incidents of this content, but gives no mentions of a time frame. Without clarification, it must be assumed this is across all history, regardless of the presence of the legislation they claim is responsible.
1.13.14.4.1.2. Con: When women, or other groups are empowered, it is very common to see a response by those that oppose those groups, for example, words disparaging to women are much more common in times of female empowerment.
1.13.14.4.2. Con: -> See 1.13.4.4.
1.13.14.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.13.4.3.2.
1.13.14.4.4. Pro: People passing out in these bathrooms after partying and heavy drinking \(which happens frequently at [colleges](http://socawlege.com/the-case-against-fully-shifting-to-gender-neutral-bathrooms/)\) or taking drugs are easy victims.
1.13.14.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.13.4.4.2.
1.13.14.4.4.2. Con: If it is already the case that someone passed out in a public restroom is in danger of assault, the bathroom being unisex wouldn't increase the likelihood of assault occurring.
1.13.14.5. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.2.3.1.2.
1.13.14.6. Con: This logic is flawed in that it presupposes a particular gender, sex and/or sexual orientation of any given perpetrator. Offenders can be of all sexualities, all genders and all sexes; users of unisex and segregated bathrooms can both, therefore, fall victim to abuse or harassment.
1.13.14.6.1. Con: Depending on the survey, only [between one and seven percent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States) of the population are estimated to identify as LGBT \(with the percentage of those who identify as homosexual being even lower\). In the grand scheme of things, they make up a small minority.
1.13.14.6.2. Pro: Indeed, due to [heteronormativity](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/heteronormative), single-gender bathrooms are often poorly designed to prevent abuse or harassment. Unisex bathrooms are more likely to invest in doors that seal to the edges and similar design features.
1.13.14.6.3. Con: The 'homosexual man - heterosexual man' constellation is not comparable to the 'woman - man' constellation as the physical power is equal in the first pair but different in the second pair because women tend to be weaker than men.
1.13.14.6.3.1. Con: This posits that the only reason anyone gets weak is because women are weak. If this is true, we would see more small people getting rapped, more big people rapist.
1.13.14.6.3.1.1. Con: [Sex differences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8477683) in physical power is not the sole contributing factor to [rape statistics](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence), but it is a major contributor to women failing to defend themselves against male aggressors, making them more vulnerable.
1.13.14.6.3.1.1.1. Con: This does not explain why we don't see small people get raped.
1.14. Con: Many of the problems currently caused by separated bathrooms could be mitigated through a better design of bathrooms.
1.14.1. Con: Some structures do not have the space or ability to redesign their bathrooms; the issues would remain unaddressed in spaces such as historical sites.
1.14.1.1. Con: At many historical sites, public bathrooms are located in an adjacent museum or visitor center.
1.14.1.2. Con: In these spaces, all existing bathrooms could be made accessible to all.
1.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.13.5.3.1.5.
1.14.3. Pro: Construction of what is inside the restroom is not a gate or barrier to entry. It is entirely reasonable to have facilities designed for different physiology, especially considering disabled, in the same space.
1.15. Pro: The American constitution points toward the necessity of unisex bathrooms.
1.15.1. Con: The constitutional precept was based upon separation by race and not by the necessary propriety and dignity of the opposite sex / sexes.
1.15.1.1. Con: Although the Brown v. Board ruling concerned itself with the question whether "separate but equal" is permissible in the context of racial segregation of schools, [numerous](http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=lsrp_papers) [legal](https://newrepublic.com/article/73905/race-gender) [scholars](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1358&context=wmjowl) have argued that the same argument should apply to gender or sex segregation in the context of schools.
1.15.2. Pro: The [Equal Protection Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause) is part of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, and condemns discrimination: it has been used as the basis of many court cases rejecting discrimination of various groups, including gender-based discrimination.
1.15.2.1. Pro: The case of [Reed v. Reed](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-4) ruled that discrimination on the bases of gender was unconstitutional.
1.15.2.1.1. Con: Reed v. Reed refers to a rule of the Idaho Probate Code according to which "males must be preferred to females". It is not clear in what sense a similar favoritism is implemented by gender-separated bathrooms that provide equal access and facilities to men and women.
1.15.2.2. Con: There is no reason to believe that gender-segregated toilets would lead to the gender discrimination that is condemned by the constitution. Segregation is not the same as discrimination.
1.15.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.
1.15.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.6.12.1.1.2.
1.15.2.3. Pro: In [Brown v. Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education) the US Supreme Court ruled \(regarding the case of racially segregated schools\) that institutions that are separate but otherwise equal are unconstitutional, as they breach the Equal Protection Clause.
1.15.2.3.1. Pro: Equality of different things should never be assumed, and as a general rule, must be proven. Different bathrooms are different things, so the burden of proof lies in showing they are the same, not in showing they are different.
1.15.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.12.1.1.1.
1.15.2.3.3. Con: It is not clear what rights guaranteed to them by the 14th Amendment individuals are deprived of through the absence of unisex bathrooms.
1.15.2.3.3.1. Pro: The Supreme Court argued [in its ruling](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/347/483) that separate but equal schools "deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities", and that education is "a right which must be made available to all on equal terms". Brown v. Board therefore relates to clearly identifiable rights violations.
1.15.2.3.3.2. Con: Through [Title VII](https://www.aauw.org/what-we-do/legal-resources/know-your-rights-at-work/title-vii/) of the Civil Rights Act and [Title IX](https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm) of the Education Amendments Act, individuals have the right to not be discriminated against based on their gender. Individuals who have to use bathrooms that do not correspond with their gender identity are exposed to potential physical as well as psychological harm and thus discriminated against.
1.15.2.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.12.1.1.2.
1.15.2.3.5. Pro: The ruling in this case stemmed from the conclusion that the 14th amendment prohibits purportedly equal, but racially-segregated separate, facilities for schooling. A core building block of this finding is that separate is inherently unequal.
1.15.2.3.5.1. Pro: To separate them \[children in grade and high schools\] from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely to ever be undone.
substitute \[children in grade and high schools\] with \[women, non-binary individuals, and/or trans individuals\], and race with gender, and there you are.
1.15.2.3.6. Pro: The use of precedent can be seen in Brown. v. Board of Education itself: the court had previously ruled that separate was alright if it was also equal in the case of [Plessy vs. Ferguson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson), so the court could not merely rule in Brown's favor citing the 14th amendment. Instead, they had to address the court's previous considerations, even though that was a private case, not a public one, and thus outside the immediate scope of the original case.
1.15.2.4. Con: Section 1 of this Amendment protects the People from the laws of the State that violate Life, Liberty, or Property, regardless of classification.  What law is currently being enforced that is depriving people of Life, Liberty, or Property, or of the equal protection of the same per the 14th Amendment?
1.15.2.4.1. Con: The last sentence of article 14 states "nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." [OSHA regulations requrie workplaces,](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/risk-management/pages/osha-restroom-rules.aspx) and[various mostly state law require restaurants](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/restroom-requirements-restaurants-41132.html), to have these facilities, while public places aren't entirely managed by the government, it is under that guarantee the right is assured.
