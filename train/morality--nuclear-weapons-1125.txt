Discussion Title: Morality & Nuclear Weapons

1. An intended first use of strategic nuclear weapons is morally wrong.
1.1. Con: The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the moral perspective of 1945 was right.
1.1.1. Con: Moral arguments against the use of nuclear weapons existed shortly after the first drop of the A-bomb.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Politicians involved already judged the bombing as unnecessary and immoral. Thus, the judgement has not been made from today's moral standards.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Leading international politicians, such as Winston Churchill, justified the drop of the A-Bomb. \([churchill-society-london.org.uk](http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/Revw1945.html)\)
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Roosevelt and Truman, called the A-Bomb a "barbarous weapon". \([doug-long.com](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm)\)
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Eisenhower's New Look policy advocated massive retaliation; even against conventional attacks. Thus he did not think it was unnecessary or immoral. \([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Look_\(policy\))\)
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Eisenhower said that the Japanese "were ready to surrender and it wasn’t necessary to hit them with that awful thing." \([washingtonsblog.com](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/10/the-real-reason-america-used-nuclear-weapons-against-japan-to-contain-russian-ambitions.html)\)
1.1.1.2. Pro: The "Anti-nuclear movement" was born in the early 1960s.
1.1.1.3. Pro: The big success of Stanley Kubrick's movie "Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the Bomb" is a proof of moral concerns about the A-Bomb in the early 1960's.
1.1.1.4. Con: Crucial for the development of the anti-nuclear-weapons-movement was not the use of the A-bomb of the Americans, but the fear, the Russians would make use of the A-bomb on American ground.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: In the 1960's the Soviet atomic bomb project was already finished for one decade.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: With the Tsar Bomba the Russians had developed the most destructive nuclear bomb by 1961 bringing the dangers of the nuclear war to new heights. \([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba)\)
1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.3. Pro: The US perceived that whoever would be [first to develop](http://www.uky.edu/Centers/Asia/SECAAS/Seras/2009/25_Yagami_2009.pdf) it, be it one of the axis countries or the US, would use it.
1.1.4. Pro: The moral aspect of nuclear weapons was neither [challenged](http://www.uky.edu/Centers/Asia/SECAAS/Seras/2009/25_Yagami_2009.pdf) nor taken into consideration before its use. Thus, it was just seen as new and bigger weapon.
1.1.5. Pro: Morality is irrelevant in an all out war.
1.1.5.1. Con: In the war against the axis powers the US claimed a moral ground despite being engaged in all out war.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Even before 1941, the US adapted provisions of the Neutrality Act on moral grounds because they "may actually give aid to the agressor and deny it to the victim". \([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_\(book\))\)
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Since Roosevelt's radio address on May 27th 1941, moral grounds to accept a world only with a "freedom from terror" entered the political rational of Washington's decision makers. \([presidency.ucsb.edu](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=16120); [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_\(book\))\)
1.1.5.2. Pro: For the many casualties of war that are certain to occur the source of death is irrelevant. This makes nuclear weapons even to conventional weapons.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Chemical weapons are a source of death which was deemed relevant enough to have the [Chemical Weapons Convention \(CWC\)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention) signed by 195 states, and ratified by 65.
1.1.5.3. Pro: With incendiary bombings of cities a moral line was crossed. The nuclear bomb does not make a significant difference anymore.
1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Before the nuclear bombs were dropped 66 cities had already been completely destroyed by conventional bombing. \([foreignpolicy.com](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/)\)
1.1.5.3.2. Pro: The firebombing of Tokyo killed around 120.000 citizens while in Hiroshima only 60.000 died. \([foreignpolicy.com](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/30/the-bomb-didnt-beat-japan-stalin-did/)\)
1.1.5.3.2.1. Con: This number does not take into account the number of long-term casualties.
1.1.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: The number doubled already after a short while. \([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki)\)
1.1.5.3.2.1.2. Con: The radioactive impact of the atomic attack was relatively small.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Today Nagasaki and Hiroshima are cities with normal levels of radiation showing that the radioactive impact did not last long
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: A comparison to Tchernobyl shows that the radioactive impact was only short lived
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: The bomb of Hiroshima detonated in [high altitude](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/patrick-takahashi/why-worry-about-fukushima_b_847250.html) preventing radioactive materials to reach the city.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.3. Pro: After the Hiroshima bombing the radiation [spread](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/kids/KPSH_E/hiroshima_e/sadako_e/subcontents_e/08higai_4_e.html) over a wide area due to strong wind.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.3.1. Con: This is bad as well, it means that even more land has been contaminated.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Because the radiation disappeared very quickly, every day the particles remained in the air weakened the human impact.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The radiation quickly [disappeared](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/kids/KPSH_E/question_box/question12.html). One week after the blast it was down to only one millionth the original dose.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Radiation cannot disappear, it just can spread out to another place.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Radiation is not dangerous within certain boundaries. Once these are reached, it does not matter if radiation disappears completely.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is a constant [natural background radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_radiation) on earth which is not harmful.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The radiation created by an atomic bomb is abnormal high.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: In fact radiation disappears depending the involved atoms' radiation [half life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life). It just takes lots of time. \([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life)\)
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.4. Pro: The two bombs, Little Boy and Fat Man, used only little fissile [material](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/patrick-takahashi/why-worry-about-fukushima_b_847250.html).
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.2.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.6. Con: The "Initial radiation" \(radiation that was released the instant the bomb exploded\) did tremendous damage to human bodies. Nearly everyone who was directly exposed within one kilometer of the hypocenter received enough radiation to kill them. \([pcf.city.hiroshima.jp](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/kids/KPSH_E/question_box/question12.html)\)
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.6.1. Con: Because everything within two kilometers was destroyed anyway, the radiation did not add much to the devastation. \([pcf.city.hiroshima.jp](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/kids/KPSH_E/question_box/question12.html)\)
1.1.5.3.2.1.3. Con: Out of the 100.000 atomic survivors only 853 cases of cancerous tumors can be attributed to the bombs. \([nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/04/11/11greenwire-hiroshima-and-nagasaki-cast-long-shadows-over-99849.html?pagewanted=all)\)
1.1.5.3.2.2. Con: One plane was required to drop one nuclear bomb, while hundreds of sorties, each dropping multiple bombs, were required to achieve the same effect using conventional ordnance.
1.1.5.3.3. Con: Due to the unique features of the A-bomb, the fact that the US had bombed cities before does not make the drop of the a-bomb more morally acceptable.
1.1.5.3.3.1. Con: Nuclear weapons have illustrated that they can end a war. That makes them morally right.
1.1.5.3.3.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #1108: The U.S. had to use nuclear weapons to achieve its goal of Japan unconditionally surrendering.
1.1.5.3.3.1.2. Con: Successfully raping and beheaded all the women and children in the enemies population would also end a war, but is not moral.
1.1.5.3.4. Pro: The precedent for the widespread- and firebombing of cities and intended killing of very large numbers of civilians was the bombing of [Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II) in February of 1945 by the US air force. This event already [desensitized](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/1995-01-01/atomic-bombings-reconsidered) American society
1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.3.1.
1.3. Pro: Nuclear weapons tests do have an extreme negative effect on climate and the ecosystem worldwide. \([theguardian.com](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/dec/12/nuclearindustry.climatechange)\)
1.3.1. Pro: Depending the wind and weather conditions, the nuclear fallout can spread over large areas and harm noninvolved actors.
1.4. Pro: Due to radiation effects future generations are hurt even though they have no responsibility for the conflict.
1.4.1. Pro: The drop of the A-bombs on Japan was clearly immoral, as it had much more intense long-term effects, especially on the children, thus civilians. \([k1project.org](http://k1project.org/explore-health/hiroshima-and-nagasaki-the-long-term-health-effects)\)
1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.2.1.3.
1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.2.1.2.
1.4.1.3. Pro: The radiation set free by nuclear bombs causes cancer. \([cancer.org](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/intheworkplace/cancer-among-military-personnel-exposed-to-nuclear-weapons)\)
1.4.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.2.1.3.
1.4.1.3.2. Pro: Between 1957 and 1987 the liver cancer rate in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the highest in the world. \([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7917541)\)
1.4.1.3.3. Con: Between 1957 and 1987 the breast cancer rate in Nagasaki and Hiroshima was lowest in the world. \([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7917541)\)
1.4.1.3.3.1. Con: But the incidence rate has doubled since the 1960s. \([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7917541)\)
1.4.1.3.4. Pro: Despite a gradual decrease, gastric cancer remained the most common malignancy among males and females throughout the surveillance period, accounting for 24% of all cancers by the late 1980s. \([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7917541)\)
1.4.1.3.5. Pro: The overall age-adjusted cancer incidence has increased from 217 to 301 per 100,000 among males, and from 176 to 197 per 100,000 among females during the first 30 years of cancer registration. \([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7917541)\)
1.4.1.3.6. Con: Only 9% of cancer deaths are attributable to long term-effects of radiation. \([stat.ucla.edu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~dinov/courses_students.dir/data.dir/AtomicBombSurvivorsData.htm)\)
1.4.1.3.6.1. Con: Although mortality studies are valuable, the accuracy of cancer diagnoses from death certificates is limited and mortality studies provide little information about the occurrence of cancers with relatively high survival rates. \([stat.ucla.edu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~dinov/courses_students.dir/data.dir/AtomicBombSurvivorsData.htm#faq2)\)
1.4.1.3.7. Pro: The excess risk for cancers other than leukemia continues today, and it seems likely that this excess risk will persist throughout the lifetime of the survivors. \([stat.ucla.edu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~dinov/courses_students.dir/data.dir/AtomicBombSurvivorsData.htm#faq2)\)
1.4.1.3.8. Pro: Excess cancer risk associated with radiation started to appear about ten years after the explosions highlighting the long-term effects. \([rerf.jp](http://www.rerf.jp/radefx/late_e/cancrisk.html)\)
1.4.1.3.8.1. Pro: Radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body, in all animals, and at any age, although radiation-induced solid tumors usually take 10–15 years, and can take up to 40 years, to become clinically manifest. \([ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20793/)\)
1.4.1.4. Con: The majority of the population was exposed to a limited radiation only which reduces cancer risk dramatically. \([rerf.jp](http://www.rerf.jp/radefx/late_e/cancrisk.html)\)
1.4.1.5. Con: Most radiation effects occured within 100 days, including Keloids, blood injuries, or radiation illness. Afterwards casualties dropped quickly. \([atomicbombmuseum.org](http://atomicbombmuseum.org/3_health.shtml)\)
1.4.1.6. Pro: Survivors suffered from negative effects other than the blast.
1.4.1.6.1. Pro: Psychological damage to the survivors included Posttraumatic stress disorder. \([history105.libraries.wsu.edu](http://history105.libraries.wsu.edu/fall2014/2014/08/29/atomicbombs/)\)
1.4.1.6.2. Pro: Survivors were stigmatised and excluded from social life. \([atomicbombmuseum.org](http://atomicbombmuseum.org/4_survivors.shtml)\)
1.4.1.6.3. Pro: A-bomb orphanes were left without help by their parents and became homeless. \([atomicbombmuseum.org](http://atomicbombmuseum.org/4_survivors.shtml)\)
1.4.1.6.4. Pro: Many elderly lost their spouses or children they relied upon for support, making them highly vulnerable. \([atomicbombmuseum.org](http://atomicbombmuseum.org/4_survivors.shtml)\)
1.4.1.7. Pro: A total of 15,633 noncancer deaths occurred between 1950 and 1990 among the 50,113 persons with significant radiation doses. \([stat.ucla.edu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~dinov/courses_students.dir/data.dir/AtomicBombSurvivorsData.htm#faq2)\)
1.4.1.7.1. Pro: Statistically significant excess risks were detected for uterine myoma, chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, thyroid disease, and cardiovascular disease. \([stat.ucla.edu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~dinov/courses_students.dir/data.dir/AtomicBombSurvivorsData.htm#faq2)\)
1.4.1.7.2. Pro: Some non-cancer diseases may be associated with altered immune functions in A-bomb survivors. Immunological study of survivors demonstrated that the proportion of helper T cells was significantly decreased with increased radiation dose. \([stat.ucla.edu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~dinov/courses_students.dir/data.dir/AtomicBombSurvivorsData.htm#faq2)\)
1.4.2. Pro: Radiation-induced [cancers](http://www.cnduk.org/campaigns/global-abolition/effects-of-nuclear-weapons) will affect many, often over twenty years later.
1.4.3. Pro: The [children](http://www.cnduk.org/campaigns/global-abolition/effects-of-nuclear-weapons) of those exposed to radiation are statistically more likely to be born with abnormalities and suffer from leukaemia.
1.5. Pro: Nuclear weapons states have [agreed](http://carnegieendowment.org/files/Sagan.pdf) to work for nuclear disarmament. Using nuclear weapons runs counter to these normative pledges.
1.5.1. Con: Disarmament agreements, such as the [NPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons#Second_pillar:_disarmament), are only vague nor do they contain compliance mechanisms to create nuclear disarmament.
1.5.2. Con: Not all states have joined the [NPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons#Non-signatories) or other disarmament treaties, such as India.
1.5.3. Pro: With "[Global Zero](http://www.globalzero.org/)" there even is an international non-partisan group of 300 world leaders dedicated to achieving the elimination of nuclear weapons.
1.5.4. Pro: On July 7  2017, 58 states signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, [the first legally binding international agreement to comprehensively prohibit nuclear weapons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Prohibition_of_Nuclear_Weapons).
1.6. Pro: Nuclear war can eliminate humankind. Using one nuclear weapon therefore risks the end of the human race.
1.6.1. Pro: A thermonuclear war will result in a [nuclear holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust) that ends modern civilization on Earth due to the widespread devastation from nuclear blasts, firestorms, and radiation sickness.
1.6.2. Con: [Parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust#Likelihood_of_complete_human_extinction) of the world, mainly in the Southern Hemisphere, would remain.
1.7. Pro: Nuclear radiation has detrimental and long lasting effects on the [environment](http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1873164,00.html).
1.7.1. Pro: If 100 Hiroshima bombs are used fire and ensuing nuclear winter would cause the global temperature to decrease by [1.3C](https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/2013/4132-2-nuclear-weapons-global-food-production-2013.pdf).
1.8. Pro: Modern conventional weapons are equally destructive and are the lesser evil because they kill less indiscriminate. This makes nuclear weapons immoral.
1.8.1. Pro: Conventional bombing can flatten cities and even whole countries, such as the aerial bombing campaigns in [Japan](http://www.japanairraids.org/), [Korea](http://apjjf.org/-Charles-K.-Armstrong/3460/article.html), and [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Rolling_Thunder) illustrate.
1.9. Pro: [Religions](http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/ethics/issues/religious/religious%20ethics.pdf) regard the use of nuclear weapons as immoral.
1.9.1. Pro: Bishop President [van Luyn](http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/ethics/issues/religious/relig_moral_ethical.pdf) of Pax Christi Netherlands called the use of nuclear weapons immoral and illegal because of their potential for massive and indiscriminate destruction of human life
1.9.2. Pro: The [Quran](http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/uploads/Islam_and_the_Bomb-Final-pt1.pdf) describes that indiscriminate killings as caused by the nuclear bombs are beyond the limit and therefore not permissible.
1.9.3. Pro: The [Holy See](http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/war-and-peace/nuclear-weapons/presentation-the-pope-and-the-bomb-2015-09-17.cfm) argues that immense suffering prohibits the use of nuclear weapons.
1.9.4. Pro: [Buddhist leaders](https://nuclear-news.net/2014/04/26/abolish-nuclear-weapons-say-buddhist-christian-and-muslim-leaders/) call for the abolishment of nuclear weapons as they pose a shadow of apocalyptic destruction.
1.10. Con: Nuclear weapons are just big bombs and, thus, subject to the same morality considerations as conventional bombs.
1.10.1. Pro: The power of nuclear weapons has been exaggerated.
1.10.1.1. Pro: There is a prevalence of [apocalyptic rhetoric](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9010231&fulltextType=RA&fileId=S0892679413000233) in discussions of nuclear weapons that causes special fear of nuclear weapons.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: [J. Robert Oppenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer) claimed that, as he watched the fireball of the first nuclear test, he was reminded of the words of Shiva from the Bhagavad Gita, “Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.”
1.10.1.1.2. Pro: [James Chadwick](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=7AREQktkaPcC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=James+Chadwick+a+vision+from+the+Book+of+Revelations&source=bl&ots=ld8ctqbWSg&sig=S-n2DcXVVDTBN6Ti5UJDWyImzEA&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNheLFy7rOAhUCipQKHTvRDooQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=James%20Chadwick%20a%20vision%20from%20the%20Book%20of%20Revelations&f=false), a British scientist observing that first test, wrote: “A great blinding light lit up the sky and earth as if God himself had appeared among us .. a vision from the Book of Revelations."
1.10.1.1.3. Pro: [Thomas Farrell](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9010231&fulltextType=RA&fileId=S0892679413000233), Chief of Field Operations of the Manhattan Project, felt “stunned by what seemed to him the blasphemy of ordinary mortals toying with forces hitherto reserved to
the Almighty".
1.10.1.2. Con: The power of individual models of nuclear warheads and the number of those warheads deployed are known.  Therefore, the power of nuclear weapons can be accurately described.
1.10.2. Pro: Nuclear weapons are a new technology but war was fought with new technologies in the past as well. The [human part](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9010231&fulltextType=RA&fileId=S0892679413000233) of the equation remains the same.
1.10.3. Con: A five megaton weapon represents greater explosive power than all the bombs used in World War II and a twenty megaton bomb more than all the explosives used in all the wars in history.  This makes nuclear weapons [different](http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/ethics/basics/granoff_nuclear-weapons-ethics-morals-law.htm) from regular bombs.
1.10.4. Con: The long-term radiation effects of nuclear weapons are unique in their ability to travel on the winds and linger for weeks.
1.11. Con: To preempt a nuclear attack the first use of nuclear weapons is morally justifiable.
1.11.1. Con: A preemptive strike is not self-defense \(preventive strike\) and thus no good reason for the use of nuclear weapons.
1.12. Pro: From a [military perspective](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9010231&fulltextType=RA&fileId=S0892679413000233) non-tactical nuclear weapons are only good in destroying cities and slaughtering people; not in fighting an army, navy or air force. This makes them immoral as the only target can be civilians.
1.12.1. Pro: [Operation Wigwam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wigwam) illustrated that the effects of nuclear weapons on submarines are limited.
1.12.2. Con: This is actually a huge misconception. The majority of strategic nuclear weapons are actually targeted at the nuclear weapons of other nations. [See Here](http://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb538-Cold-War-Nuclear-Target-List-Declassified-First-Ever/) \(I will concede that civilians are targeted in this study, but they are not priority targets\)
1.12.3. Con: Strategic nuclear weapons, delivered from long range, could destroy massed military units such as a fleet in port or aircraft on an airbase more quickly and reliably than tactical weapons that must be delivered from relatively close range.
1.13. Pro: The decision to use nuclear weapons lays in the hands of some individuals. This is not democratic and therefore morally wrong.
1.13.1. Pro: There is no global government that can endorse the use of nuclear weapons.
1.13.2. Pro: Only [some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons) states possess nuclear weapons while the consequences of their use can be global.
1.13.3. Con: The targets of weapons are, of course, not involved in the decisions about their use. This is the same with every weapon.
1.13.4. Con: Nuclear attacks can take place in minutes.  A response must occur before the chain of command is disrupted.  Involving more people increases the time required to provide information, reach decisions and act.
1.14. Pro: The [International Court of Justice](http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/ethics/basics/granoff_nuclear-weapons-ethics-morals-law.htm) declared that a use of nuclear weapons would violate international law.
1.14.1. Pro: Nuclear weapons are indiscriminate and therefore morally wrong.
1.14.1.1. Pro: Nuclear weapons are not able to distinguish between civilian and military targets. This makes them indiscriminate and therefore morally wrong.
1.14.1.2. Pro: Nuclear weapons cause unnecessary suffering to non-combatants.
1.15. Con: A country under conventional attack that can only stop these attacks with nuclear weapons has the [responsibility to use](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=g5N-RoW8bAkC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=Nuclear+War:+The+Moral+Dimension&source=bl&ots=IhH7dCnCsQ&sig=lo6OVdLeOMu3lkdaYWznd1f_cBw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiM4ePk0brOAhVIF5QKHaf5C1QQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&q&f=false) them in order to save its citizens.
1.16. Pro: -> See 1.14.1.
1.17. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
