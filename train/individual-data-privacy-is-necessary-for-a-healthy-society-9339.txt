Discussion Title: Individual data privacy is necessary for a healthy society

1. Protecting individual data privacy is necessary for a healthy society.
1.1. Pro: Privacy is important to human psychological development.
1.1.1. Pro: Children today are given much [less](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/03/children-need-privacy-to-play) privacy than previous generations.
1.2. Pro: Access to large amounts of personal data leads to the ability to control an individual's opinions.
1.2.1. Pro: Social media data hast been used by Russia's interference in the [2016 US presidential election.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#Social_media_and_internet_trolls)
1.2.2. Pro: Assuming the ability to control opinion is true; we have no way of knowing if our beliefs and values are our own autonomous ones or whether they have been manufactured for us by a third-party.
1.3. Pro: Privacy enables freedom of thought. Without freedom of thought we cannot develop ideas, and without ideas humans canâ€™t do much and all progress is limited.
1.4. Pro: It's not binary. We need data and controls over it. Cars can carry and cars can kill. We allow them but regulate them
1.5. Con: Large amounts of highly accessible personal data may lead to scientific discovery, or allow insight that would otherwise be impossible.
1.5.1. Con: Researchers should ask for users' consent before incorporating private data into their work.
1.5.2. Pro: Using large data sets in [medical](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5331970/) research seems promising.
1.5.2.1. Con: Many issues around privacy and methodology have to be worked out still.
1.5.3. Pro: Personal data can be stored pseudonymized. Only with the key of the patient could physicians assign the dataset to the person.
1.5.3.1. Con: The de-anonymization problem means that people and algorithms can successfully identify contributors to the dataset
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Using individual data-points, each with their own pseudonym negates this issue.
1.5.4. Con: This is more an argument for anonymity than an argument against individual data privacy.
1.6. Pro: Individual privacy is a basic human right.
1.6.1. Pro: Invasion of privacy is a human rights violation [according](http://www.ala.org/aboutala/offices/iro/awardsactivities/resolutionifla) to ALA.
1.6.2. Pro: Privacy is a fundamental human right [recognized](http://gilc.org/privacy/survey/intro.html) by the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
1.7. Con: Secrecy is the root of corruption and therefore transparency is the antidote.
1.7.1. Con: Some information should be protected by privacy laws, such as medical information.
1.8. Pro: Privacy in action like voting is required to ensure the delegate votes with their true belief and without social pressure.
1.9. Con: People with a clear conscience have nothing to fear from transparency.
1.9.1. Con: Privacy is necessary to allow individuals to fully formulate their opinions.  In the other extreme of total transparency, there would be no time to properly consider ones arguments before they were attacked by observers.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Any opinion a person expresses is subject to interpretation. A biased listener might interpret an otherwise innocent sentence as an admittance of wrongdoing, and getting that person in trouble.
1.9.2. Con: One can have a clear conscience and still be entitled to exercise their right to data privacy.
1.9.2.1. Pro: The wish for privacy alone should not be read as an admission of guilt or somehow make one suspicious.
