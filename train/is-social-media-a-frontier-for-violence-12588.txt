Discussion Title: Is Social Media a Frontier for Violence?

1. Social media is a frontier for violence.
1.1. Pro: [Social media](http://yvpc.sph.umich.edu/social-media-perpetuate-youth-violence/) allows gangs to club together, compare 'fight compilation' videos, rival other gangs; this perpetuates existing violence and can be used to rally others to their groups.
1.2. Con: There is '[no clear evidence](https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/12/640702-no-clear-evidence-social-media-leads-more-violent-behavior-un-backed-study)' to support that social media leads to violent behaviour.
1.3. Pro: [Online bullying](https://www.bullying.co.uk/cyberbullying/what-to-do-if-you-re-being-bullied-on-a-social-network/) is rife, and can easily spill over into the real world.
1.4. Pro: [This study shows](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/couch-crisis/-internet-made-me-do-itsocial-media-and-potential-violence-adolescents) that teens that spend hours “liking” their friends’ pictures on social networking sites may be significantly more likely to have other traits associated with violent behavior.
1.5. Pro: [Social media](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/18/social-media-propaganda-terror-financiers-operate-on-internet.html) allow terror groups sometimes to explicitly broadcast calls for financial support.
1.6. Con: Tracking of terrorists becomes easier if they use social media for their propaganda.
1.6.1. Con: The terrorists behind social networking accounts are hard to identify because they often sign into the platforms through virtual private networks, [or VPNs](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/business/media/terrorism-social-networks-freedom.html), that hide their identities and locations.
1.7. Con: Social media provides a large platform to [raise awareness](http://www.breakthesilencedv.org/social-media-campaigns/) against violence; violence against children, domestic violence, sexual violence, etc.
1.8. Con: As different stories go viral, social media enables people to empathize with others.
