Discussion Title: State I.D. Cards should be 100% free, with a free reprint annually.

1. State I.D. Cards should be 100% free, with a free reprint annually.
1.1. Con: If non-citizens are given a free state I.D. they may end up mistakenly being allowed to vote in their non-native country.
1.2. Con: This is going to lead to a federal identification card, which will end up being a social security card with a picture. We don't need this.
1.3. Con: This is going to cost a lot of money to get the infrastructure and personnel in place. Imagine if everyone went into the DMV at once.
1.4. Pro: This removes the racial targeting aspect of requiring identification for doing any kind of above board business.
1.5. Pro: This allows for better tracking of personal information, such as picture, height, weight, and address. This can actually help some of our minoritized groups.
1.6. Con: This will turn into a government lead data mining scheme against the populace.
1.7. Pro: Identification cards would allow you to prove who you are to any government agency, and prevent mistaken identity.
1.8. Con: Despite removing the paywall, this doesn't help people without transportation or the disabled get to the building to get their I.D cards.
1.9. Con: This will lead to authorities demanding I.D. cards from people, and challenge them even more than they used to about their migration status.
1.10. Pro: This could serve to clarify immigration status, and the right to vote or receive benefits in the state.
