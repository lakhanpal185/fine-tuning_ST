Discussion Title: Should All Drug Trial Participants Be Chosen By Lottery?

1. All participants for drug trials that involve humans in the US should be chosen randomly from those in the population who meet the required characteristics of the study.
1.1. Con: Randomly selecting participants for trials takes away the chance for those who want to have access to potential treatments before they are widely available to step forward and volunteer.
1.1.1. Pro: Participants usually hope to improve their health through trials. The possibility of not receiving any treatment but only a placebo is thus among the most influential reasons that keep potential participants from signing up \([Mills et al, p. 146](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204506705769)\).
1.1.2. Pro: In [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4706669/) of volunteers participating in medical trials, the access to the "best treatment available" was among the main reasons given for participation.
1.1.2.1. Pro: People participating in trials may be in an otherwise terminal state and participating in a trial is last-ditch change to survive.
1.1.2.2. Con: In trials that rely on voluntary participants desperate for treatment, many of them are denied treatment due to the use of placebos. By randomly selecting participants, many would presumably not be desperate for the treatment and therefore not care about having it denied to them due to the use of placebos.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Where there are existing treatments, it is rare to use a true placebo as the control group - more commonly, the [usual care](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2647648/) standard is used as the comparison.
1.1.2.3. Con: This study is talking about clinical trials that were conducted for cancer research. The outcome cannot be generalized for all clinical trials.
1.1.3. Con: Since most trials require people to actually have the condition being treated, some people who need access to potential treatments will still receive it.
1.1.3.1. Con: Drug tests often require a control group that are given placebos and no other form of treatment. It is extra-unethical to withhold treatments when participants are not freely consenting to the possibility.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: It is unfortunate that not all of those suffering from a disease will get effective treatment but they are a necessary sacrifice in order to improve medical knowledge and treatment for all future patients.
1.1.3.1.3. Con: The alternative to a compulsory participant receiving a placebo is that they do not participate at all, which is certainly not better than a placebo, and possibly worse. So it is not clear why forcing them to participate and then giving them a placebo is morally wrong.
1.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: There is no deception involved, since [by law](http://www.research.uci.edu/compliance/human-research-protections/researchers/placebo.html) prospective trial participants must be informed about the possibility of receiving a placebo and the nature of the placebo.
1.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Not participating at all is possibly worse because a\) the placebo may have a "placebo effect" which improves the health of the individual, and b\) going into the study you had a 50% probability of getting the real treatment.
1.1.3.1.3.3. Con: The alternative to being in the trial would presumably be whatever form of treatment is normally given to people with that condition.
1.1.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.
1.1.3.2. Con: Drug trials often require [other forms of treatment to cease](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=HgmrI2r5eo4C&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=drug+trials+cease+other+treatments+interference&source=bl&ots=TfIGKRFbLp&sig=DYX6USpZPhZJX5psi-NCAsSwaYs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj20qb-kNTPAhUCGJQKHTjjCJEQ6AEIOTAE#v=onepage&q=drug%20trials%20cease%20other%20treatments%20interference&f=false) in order to isolate the effectiveness of the new treatment, which may lead to worse health outcomes if the newly-trialled drug is less effective.
1.1.4. Con: This effect would be, at least partially, compensated for by increased knowledge about the treatment being tested \(resulting from the public nature of the trial\) once it is available on the market.
1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.3. Pro: In the status quo, people who take part in medical trials are those who need money, which is a dangerous form of coercion. This policy removes this coercive financial incentive in favour of a fair method: random chance.
1.3.1. Pro: A choice cannot be freely made when one option results in starvation or homelessness.
1.3.1.1. Con: If those are the choices someone faces, taking away the option of the trial and forcing them to be homeless is even worse than allowing them a "coercive" choice that it is better for their quality of life.
1.3.1.2. Con: Freedom exists as a spectrum rather than a binary. We are more or less free rather than being free or not.
1.3.2. Con: Economic coercion is an unavoidable part of a capitalist system; most people must work in order to survive.
1.3.2.1. Con: People must work, but are not forced to take part in medical trials that might put their health in danger.
1.3.3. Con: Even if this coercion is bad, it is more wrong to take away a popular method for low-income people to get [free medical treatment](https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/why-should-i-participate-clinical-trial).
1.3.3.1. Pro: In the US [millions of people are uninsured](http://kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/) and so cannot afford healthcare. In many cases participating in a trial may be their only option to receive treatment.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Loss of employment and declining incomes meant that five million Americans lost employment-based health insurance during the recent economic recession [\(2007–09\)](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2010/12/03/hlthaff.2010.1003.full).
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: 46% of uninsured adults said that the primary reason they were uninsured was because it was too expensive, making it the [most common reason](http://kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/) cited for being uninsured.
1.3.3.1.3. Con: Limiting the poor to only the most experimental and tentative treatments when so many drug trials fail is immoral. Rather than perpetuating this reliance, we should strive to resolve this problem.
1.3.3.2. Con: [Participation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23295802) [in](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11956272) [cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19711497) drug trials correlates with high education and income.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Highly educated persons may have a better understanding of the risks and procedures involved in a drug trial and so are more likely to participate.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Wealthy people have [a longer life expectancy](http://www.princeton.edu/rpds/papers/Deaton_Health_Inequality_and_Economic_Development_JEL.pdf) and disproportionately die from diseases such as cancer that are not easily preventable. These kinds of diseases have a greater need for new treatments, hence the greater number of trials.
1.3.3.2.3. Pro: The most expensive doctors may have better knowledge of cutting-edge drug trials and thus pass on that knowledge to their wealthy patients.
1.3.3.2.4. Con: All of these papers relate to cancer drug trials. The observation that higher income is correlated with more participation may not be generalizable to trials that are open to all healthy individuals.
1.3.3.2.4.1. Pro: Cancer trials are probably not representative of trials more generally - participants in cancer trials are hoping for a personal cure. In most other trials, participants are incentivised by the monetary reward - hence they attract more low-income participants.
1.3.3.3. Con: If the policy means that the trials improve in quality, then that will result in effective drugs entering the market earlier and becoming more accessible and affordable. This would, in the long-term, provide the poor with more access to treatments even if it means that fewer of them get to participate in drug trials.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Mandatory participation in drug tests would improve the quality and utility of medical trials.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: A randomly-selected sample is more representative of a population of people with a disease than a self-selected sample.
1.3.3.3.1.1.1. Con: What prevents participant samples from being representative is not the selection method but the variety of - oftentimes necessary - exclusion factors.
1.3.3.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15672843) of asthma patients concluded that only 3.3% of a patient population would fit the criteria used for trials.
1.3.3.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: A [review of studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15373816) found various accounts of language-related and cultural exclusion factors that prevented the participation of minorities.
1.3.3.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Many of these, such as availability of interpreters, seem more about convenience than necessity. The accuracy of trial results gained by a proper random sample is more important than researchers' convenience.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: Under the status quo, several groups of people are underrepresented in clinical trials.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Ethnic minorities such as black citizens and [Hispanics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222419/) in the United States and [South Asians](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16216378/) in the United Kingdom are underrepresented in trials.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: In the status quo, medical trials rarely include sufficient numbers of female volunteers, whose bodies can respond very differently to drugs. This has caused [serious problems](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/30/fda-clinical-trials-gender-gap-epa-nih-institute-of-medicine-cardiovascular-disease) with our understanding of sex-based differences in responses to medications.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Women are excluded not because they don't sign up, but because companies have interests in excluding them - to simplify the variables in their trials, for example.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: That this problem has gone on for so long would suggest that the drug companies are systemically unwilling to recruit minority groups and that a random approach is the best way to ensure it.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: Especially older people are [generally](http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/6/659) underrepresented in and excluded from clinical trials. This is the case even in clinical trials that target diseases that affect primarily older generations, for example [cancer](http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/23/13/3112.short).
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: The incidence of a wide range of age-correlated diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's and heart failure, [frequently peaks](http://www.inventivhealth.com/pdf/Elderly_Representation_in_Clinical_Trials_Not_A_Gray_Area.pdf) after the cut-off age for drug trials for their treatments.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.3.2. Con: The primary reason for this under-representation of old people is not their unwillingness to participate but rather the [lack of clarity](http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/23/13/3112.short) about their condition and treatment tolerance.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Older trial participants can have multiple co-morbid conditions, making it significantly harder to track the impact of a tested drug.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: Older trial participants are more likely to be on other medications, increasing the risk of negative drug interactions.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.3.2.3. Pro: A reduced life-expectancy can pose a problem for multi-year trials.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.3.2.4. Pro: Old people are [just as willing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12805325) to participate in medical trials as younger patients. Yet they are offered participation far less often based on doctors' perception of their age and suitability.
1.3.3.3.1.1.3. Pro: [Diversity](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/12/16/459666750/clinical-trials-still-dont-reflect-the-diversity-of-america) in clinical studies is critically important, as different groups respond to drugs in [different ways](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2594139/).
1.3.3.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: There is evidence that some people [respond differently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacogenomics) to certain drugs on the basis of genetics.
1.3.3.3.1.1.4. Pro: This will eliminate the effect of various participant [selection biases](http://jech.bmj.com/content/58/8/635.full) that can skew results.
1.3.3.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: For example, selecting patients who have been on waiting lists for a long time pre-selects for patients who are [surviving their conditions](http://jech.bmj.com/content/58/8/635.full).
1.3.3.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: For example, over-selection of [patients with access](http://jech.bmj.com/content/58/8/635.full) to high-quality medical care and well-informed and connected medical professionals.
1.3.3.3.1.1.4.3. Pro: It would be harder to avoid recruiting those with language barriers or other special needs, which would increase the representation of minorities in trial participant samples.
1.3.3.3.1.1.5. Pro: Poorer individuals are the [most likely to volunteer](https://medium.com/matter/did-big-pharma-test-your-meds-on-homeless-people-a6d8d3fc7dfe#.3jt0oe7ph), because the monetary incentives most strongly affect them. This skews the data towards a disproportionately poor sample, which makes it inaccurate - because the poor have differing dietary and lifestyle habits.
1.3.3.3.1.1.5.1. Con: It is possible to \(to some extent\) control for lifestyle factors in the course of clinical trials, especially considering that poor individuals do not have identical lifestyles.
1.3.3.3.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: For example, though the diets of poor individuals may on average differ from those of wealthier individuals, there is still a wide range of diets among poorer individuals, so most possible diets will be present in the sample.
1.3.3.3.1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Even if the sample is not representative of the frequency of each specific diet in the population \(for example, there may be an overrepresentation of [sugary drink consumption](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/23/the-difference-between-what-rich-and-poor-americans-eat-is-getting-bigger/?utm_term=.53399481a074), which is more common among poor individuals\), this can be recognized and weighed for by statistical models.
1.3.3.3.1.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.3.3.3.1.2. Pro: The knowledge that you could be selected to test any drug creates political incentives for society to invest in good regulation and supervision of the drug testing industry.
1.3.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: In the status quo, only a small proportion of the public has any involvement in drug testing, and so this is not a central public issue.
1.3.3.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: If most people aren't affected by this, they are unlikely to feel like it is important to them. This means people won't feel strongly enough for this issue in order for it to become a central public issue.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2. Con: Public outcry will lead to political pushback which will harm the implementation of the policy.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Public opposition to the policy will make it harder to enact necessary reforms, especially if politicians shy away from associating themselves with it.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: If the policy is implemented incorrectly without sufficient reforms, potential harms would be bigger and potential benefits would be smaller. This would mean that participants are put in danger and face a larger risk to their health, and trials would not produce results significant enough to improve their utility or reduce their cost.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Public backlash is unlikely to lead to a version of the policy that leaves the public in greater danger than the danger they have objected to. It is far more likely that deeply cautious regulations are put in place.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Public outcry is a result of the people seeing the policy as invasive, so measures within it \(such as regulatory oversight of trials and tracking of people's medical data\) would likely be seen as additionally invasive. Though public outcry may not be enough to prevent the policy, it is likely to be enough to reduce the extent to which the policy is invasive and minimize the measures within.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the states with wide-spread opposition to it and Republicans in power have [ranked worst](http://www.perrspectives.com/blog/archives/002435.htm) in health care rankings.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: If backlash is motivated by a concern for the safety of participants, any measures necessary to improve safety will have substantial support.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.1.2. Con: If politicians stand in the way of making reforms that would make obvious improvements to the policy, they would be demonized for fighting it by the media and the public.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: If they simply attach themselves to a movement to repeal the system in its entirety, they are likely to avoid many of these harms.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: It is much riskier for politicians to try to change an unpopular policy rather than simply oppose it.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.1.4. Con: Conversely, public opposition to the policy might encourage politicians to associate themselves with fixing the perceived problems.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.2. Con: Even if implementation is harmed and a less powerful version of the policy is implemented, it could still be preferable to not having the policy at all.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.2.1. Con: A less powerful version of the policy would involve skipping the improvements to regulations that are supposed to bring many of the benefits of implementing this policy.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.3. Pro: Healthcare policies that are only partially implemented often end up being incredibly inefficient.
1.3.3.3.1.2.2.3.1. Pro: Because of public opposition to full implementation of single-payer healthcare, the US has a mixed [public-private hybrid](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/05/neither-public-nor-private-a-health-care-system-muddling-through/257123/) healthcare system which generates [many](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/02/10/health.care.costs/) [perverse](http://www.npr.org/2014/01/16/262946913/how-perverse-incentives-drive-up-health-care-costs) [incentives](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/03/05/hospital-systems-vs-private-practice-doctors/in-health-care-fee-for-service-is-a-perverse-incentive).
1.3.3.3.1.2.3. Pro: There have been many reported cases of frivolous, dangerous or misleading [research conducted on human subjects](http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7314&context=jclc).
1.3.3.3.1.2.3.1. Con: The amount of "bad" human research has gone down significantly since the [Belmont Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Report) and the establishment of [Institutional Review Boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board) in 1974.
1.3.3.3.1.2.4. Con: This relies on the assumption that problems in the process are simply due to regulation and supervision. In reality there are systemic issues \(such as unpredictability of drug interactions\) that no amount of political pressure can remove.
1.3.3.3.1.2.5. Pro: Because medical tests are very important, and forcing people to partake in them touches on basic human rights, everyone should care about them and engage in the discussion.
1.3.3.3.1.2.5.1. Pro: This means that the policy will be hugely controversial as people care deeply about upholding human rights.
1.3.3.3.1.2.6. Con: Prices of drug trials are already gotten much more expensive because of added safety regulations that don't provide much good. There's no reason to believe that safety regulation that would come out of this would do any better.
1.3.3.3.1.3. Con: Willing participants are more likely to follow the prescribed course of treatment, which is critical for good research and for their safety. Unwilling participants, on the other hand, might refuse to follow instructions precisely out of spite or anger.
1.3.3.3.1.3.1. Con: Involuntary participants will be afraid of the trials, and that fear will motivate them to follow instructions as carefully as possible to minimize the chances of being harmed.
1.3.3.3.1.3.2. Con: If we make payment for non-voluntary participants contingent on proper completion, people will follow the course correctly.
1.3.3.3.1.3.2.1. Con: This will not be an effective motivator for any involuntary participants who fear the side-effects of the medication being tested, unless they are in significant need of money.
1.3.3.3.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Given that even a few participants not following instructions can skew results, this would have a serious detrimental impact on the reliability of research.
1.3.3.3.1.3.2.2. Con: This relies on being able to accurately assess whether study participants have followed instructions or are merely claiming to have done so, something that is not always possible.
1.3.3.3.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Many studies do not allow for effective supervision as participants have to take doses of medication too regularly and over too extended a period to require them to attend a location to be supervised.
1.3.3.3.1.3.2.3. Con: This assumes that payment will be a motivator that trial subjects are interested in. Many randomly selected participants will not be in need of money.
1.3.3.3.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Indeed, if the treatment being tested has side-effects that affect the subject's productivity, they may stand to lose more money than the relevant compensation amount if they follow the course of treatment.
1.3.3.3.1.3.3. Pro: Voluntary participants will likely have more experience with medical trials, increasing the likelihood that they will be capable and aware enough to correctly follow instructions.
1.3.3.3.1.3.4. Pro: Not participating voluntarily, people may be more likely to follow normal life patterns. This can be dangerous to the subjects and can damage the research results, for instance if they don't take the drugs in the required intervals.
1.3.3.3.1.4. Pro: Many medical trials [fail](http://forteresearch.com/news/recruitment-efforts-fail-enroll-enough-patients/) because of an insufficient number of [participants](http://www.cancer.net/one-five-clinical-trials-adults-cancer-never-finish-%E2%80%93-new-study-examines-reasons). This policy would solve this problem and make medical trials more effective.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1. Pro: 19% of surveyed medical trials failed because they were [unable to attract the number of patients necessary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25475878) to take place or produce reliable results.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1. Con: If a study was unable to attract the number of participants needed it probably was not a very important or necessary trial.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1.1. Con: It is evidently quite difficult to recruit study participants. Thus a study failing due to lack of sample size is more likely to be a result of compensation offered or poor advertising methods.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Increasingly, companies are going further to find study [participants](http://www.wsj.com/articles/companies-try-new-ways-to-attract-patients-to-drug-trials-1468858289), such as partnering with Lyft to give people rides to the clinic or monitoring online message boards for people with the relevant conditions.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Many of the most urgent medical challenges may have potential cures with particularly extreme side-effects, making it hard for relevant trials to attract participants.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1.3. Con: Many of the most socially important studies may suffer from fundraising issues that prevent them offering good compensation for their trial.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: This could be due to issues being poorly understood by the donating public.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1.3.2. Pro: This could be due to issues facing social stigma \(as HIV did in the '70s and '80s\) that prevents public discussion and/or investment.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Mental health problems are surrounded by a [variety of stigmas](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/mental-illness-stigma.html), some of which are structural in nature and result in a lack of funding, for example for research into [depression](http://www.nature.com/news/medical-research-if-depression-were-cancer-1.16307).
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: For example, social stigma around smoking affects which cancers [funding for cancer research](https://www.patientpower.info/video/research-and-social-stigma-why-some-cancers-get-more-attention) is directed to.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1.3.3. Pro: This could be due to research being conducted by small companies, unable to match the larger funding available to companies researching popular lifestyle drugs \(e.g. viagra replacements, weight loss medication\).
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1.3.3.1. Con: The vast majority of studies are done by large corporations, so funding issues are more a result of prioritization than access.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Given that lifestyle drugs are more likely to be more profitable than, say, a drug to treat Huntington's, companies are likely to devote more resources to the drug more likely to be profitable.
1.3.3.3.1.4.1.2. Pro: The number of medical trials closed due to an insufficient number of participants can rise to [more than half](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20595245) in the case of late-stage trials related to cancer.
1.3.3.3.1.4.2. Pro: The most common problem that recruiters for medical trials face is the "finding or identifying patients who meet eligibility criteria", as [one survey](http://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/barriers-clinical-trial-recruitment-and-possible-solutions-stakeholder-survey?pageID=2) concludes. Randomly choosing participants from the population would solve this problem.
1.3.3.3.1.4.2.1. Con: In order to obtain a valid sample size of appropriate participants, a tremendous number of people's files would have to be accessed, which is a large invasion of privacy.
1.3.3.3.1.4.2.1.1. Con: Much of this process could be automated through a series of data filters.
1.3.3.3.1.4.2.1.2. Con: If the data is truly collected through anonymised files and only rarely decoded, it's unclear why this harms anyone, or why individuals have a reason to oppose this.
1.3.3.3.1.4.3. Con: Pharmaceutical companies should increase their social networking/marketing spending to ensure that they can attract enough patients.
1.3.3.3.1.4.3.1. Pro: The US government is [the wealthiest in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)). US pharmaceutical companies are [among the wealthiest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_biotechnology_%26_pharmaceutical_companies) in the world. If these two vastly wealthy nodes of power can not leverage their huge resources into finding sufficient numbers of participants in medical trials then the fault lies squarely with them and their intransigence.
1.3.3.3.1.4.4. Con: When trial participants are distributed over the entire US it will be more expensive to monitor the participants and provide proper care for them. This will result in worse care and higher trial costs.
1.3.3.3.1.5. Pro: People in desperate need of money from the trials have an incentive to lie and/or exaggerate symptoms in order to get selected and continue to receive money from the trials. A random selection would eliminate the possibility of the trials being corrupted in that way.
1.3.3.3.1.5.1. Pro: Corrupt/skewed results like this would lead to one of two outcomes. Either the cheating is caught, leading to more time and resources spent on further trials as the current results are now invalid, or the corrupt results remain unnoticed and the drug enters the market despite insufficient data on the effects of the drug.
1.3.3.3.1.5.2. Con: It is hardly possible that people can exaggerate symptoms that are common entry criteria for clinical trials, e.g. having a particular type of cancer, a certain treatment history, or having a certain age. [\(Roche, p.4\)](http://www.roche.com/dam/jcr:1d4d1b52-7e01-43ac-862f-17bb59912485/en/understanding_clinical_trials.pdf)
1.3.3.3.1.5.2.1. Con: There are many illnesses that can easily be faked - for example, most mental illnesses. These types of illnesses would then be disproportionately vulnerable to poor quality trials, as people willing to engage in this tactic would all channel towards trials for treatments for these particular illnesses.
1.3.3.3.1.5.3. Pro: Lack of proper regulation and supervision might lead to ineffective drugs or unsafe drugs being put into the market, which poses a health risk to consumers.
1.3.3.3.1.5.3.1. Pro: The consumers in these scenarios are unaware of the potential risks or effects of the drug they're taking and thus there is no informed consent.
1.3.3.3.1.5.3.2. Con: Proper regulation and supervision can be put in place regardless of this policy.
1.3.3.3.1.5.4. Con: The first phase of human trials involves testing in healthy subjects to determine safe dosage levels and identify side-effects. These trials currently pay participants. There is no reason to believe that participation in these trials would not be enough for those looking to make money off participation in drug trials.
1.3.3.3.1.5.5. Con: Phase II and III trials - those with people suffering from the relevant condition - often do not pay participants anyway; the payment is the treatment.
1.3.3.3.1.6. Con: Mandatory participation would result in greater media coverage of trials, since everyone would be interested in information about a process they might be randomly selected for. This can harm the quality of trials.
1.3.3.3.1.6.1. Pro: If media coverage of a few instances of participants being harmed leads to mass public outrage, then regulations could become so tight that it becomes more difficult to create new trials, thus slowing medical advancement.
1.3.3.3.1.6.1.1. Pro: The benefits of faster trial processes are not easily measurable and therefore not obvious to the public, while isolated accidents that harm participants can easily be turned into major news stories to harness public sympathy. This means the public will be incapable of properly weighing the costs and benefits and will err towards regulations which are too tight.
1.3.3.3.1.6.1.2. Pro: More stringent trial requirements can lead to delays in the release of drugs, which can be incredibly harmful. For example, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act sped up drug approvals by about 10 months, and is [estimated](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272707001600) to have saved 140,000-310,000 lifeyears.
1.3.3.3.1.6.1.2.1. Con: Faster approval processes have led to the proliferation of [lower-quality drugs](http://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/10301576/fda-slowing-innovation). For example, about [85-90%](http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e4348.long) of new drugs don't offer any health benefits to patients over existing drugs.
1.3.3.3.1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: The need to have drugs that are under patent to maximise profit is a far greater contributor to this trend. A significant proportion of these drugs are designed to be biochemically identical to drugs coming out from under patent, but to allow the company to market them as an improved version.
1.3.3.3.1.6.2. Con: Medical trials are so extensive and so common that they would not make for good news coverage beyond the first few that occur after the policy is implemented.
1.3.3.3.1.6.2.1. Con: This is unlikely to be the case with this policy as everyone will feel like they have the potential to be the next 'victim'. This will ensure that these stories always get airtime.
1.3.3.3.1.7. Pro: This policy would require and therefore go hand in hand with extended government oversight of drug trials.
1.3.3.3.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.5.3.
1.3.3.3.1.7.2. Pro: This would make it much harder for those conducting trials to skew the results, intentionally or unintentionally.
1.3.3.3.1.7.2.1. Pro: It will be much harder to [concoct patients](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/05/we-need-clinical-trials-but-we-must-remain-vigilant-against-their-abuse) from scratch.
1.3.3.3.1.7.2.2. Pro: This will make it much harder to erase patients who [drop out](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6215-10-52) of trials.
1.3.3.3.1.7.2.3. Pro: It will be harder to not report trials that show negative results as the agency selecting the participants would be aware of the trial.
1.3.3.3.1.7.2.4. Con: This will only prevent sampling abuses. Issues of manipulation of subjects or data, or reporting errors would not be impacted at all.
1.3.3.3.1.7.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.1.4.
1.3.3.3.1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.5.3.2.
1.3.3.3.1.8. Con: Wealthy pharmaceutical companies can afford to pay suitable candidates to participate in drug trials voluntarily in order to improve their quality. There is no need for mandatory trials.
1.3.3.3.1.8.1. Con: While pharmaceutical companies may sponsor [clinical trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-studies/learn#WhoConducts), they rarely conduct trials themselves. Often clinical trials are led by researchers that manage to receive funding.
1.3.3.3.1.8.1.1. Con: Though [sponsors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial) do not conduct clinical trials, they are the ones that design the trials.
1.3.3.3.1.8.1.2. Con: In which case the relationship between Big Pharma and clinical research funding needs to be addressed. Given the huge wealth available, Big Pharma should only pursue voluntary participation. If this were an impoverished third world country with no industry there might be argument for mandatory participation, but not in the Western Hemisphere.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: Even if drugs are produced more efficiently, it does not mean that they will ultimately end up being cheaper. Patent law means that the manufacturing drug company has a monopoly over sale of the drug for [20 years](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm079031.htm#howlongpatentterm), so decreases in costs of production will only have a [slight effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_price) on price.
1.3.3.3.2.1. Con: Easier testing means that alternative drugs for the same condition can make it to the market more quickly, increasing competitive pressures and driving down prices.
1.3.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: High drug prices are not solely due to patents: a particular company's monopoly control over a drug often persists far beyond the expiration of a patent. If generic versions become easier to manufacture, we can break these monopoly structures and lower prices.
1.3.4. Con: Presumably being forced by the state to participate in a clinical trial is more coercive than the comparatively soft coercive power of adverse circumstances or lack of education.
1.3.5. Pro: The status quo is a dangerous form of coercion, because those who are already impoverished are unlikely to be able to afford quality medical care if something goes wrong.
1.3.5.1. Pro: The organizations that run trials are not likely to help, as [Federal law](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120173515260330205) in the US does not require compensation for those harmed, merely that such compensation procedures are spelled out in the consent form.
1.3.5.2. Con: Those harmed by drug trials can use tort law to sue the company running the drug trials.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: The risk of lawsuits is a strong disincentive to drug companies developing treatments that may have severe side effects. This slows down the rate of medical research.
1.3.5.2.2. Con: Impoverished participants may not have the resources to hire a lawyer for a lawsuit.
1.3.5.2.2.1. Con: Class-action lawsuits can be used to spread the cost of a lawsuit across many possible participants.
1.3.5.2.2.2. Con: If a lawsuit has a high degree of success, many lawyers and law firms will waive their fees in exchange for a cut of any settlement.
1.3.5.2.2.2.1. Con: Such court cases still require a significant commitment of plaintiffs' time, something which those living on subsistence wages cannot afford.
1.3.5.2.2.3. Pro: This is particularly the case when facing well-funded, multinational corporations, who are able to drag out litigation over many, many years.
1.3.5.2.2.3.1. Pro: When participants are also terminally ill, either as a result of the tested drug, or because of the condition the drug was intended to treat, this can result in companies "running out the clock" on such claims.
1.3.5.2.3. Con: Suing a drug company makes it unlikely that drug trial participants can continue working as guinea pigs, endangering their livelihood.
1.3.5.2.4. Con: Consent forms often [absolve](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120173515260330205) those running the study of reasonably expectable negative outcomes.
1.3.5.2.5. Pro: In many places, patients harmed by drug company negligence or misconduct can receive punitive damages leading to large payouts in excess of what is justified by the harms to them, including pain and suffering.
1.3.6. Pro: Those who are already impoverished are less likely to be well-educated, increasing the chance that they do not understand the risks that they are signing up to.
1.3.7. Con: Poorly educated and qualified individuals, who might find few other sources of income, and those in dire need would lose a source of income.
1.3.7.1. Con: Governments should be responsible for ensuring that the poorly qualified have good jobs and training opportunities. They should not have to turn to drug trials to survive.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: Participation in drug trials does not solve any of the underlying problems that poorly educated and underqualified individuals face, as they don't equip them with any skills useful for their future career prospects.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Pro: The [unemployment rate](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2016/data-on-display/education-matters.htm) for individuals without a high school degree is at least 50% higher than for those with at least a high school diploma, and almost thrice that for Americans with at least a Bachelor's degree.
1.3.7.1.1.2. Con: The money they earn through this low-time-commitment work can be invested in education, or can take the place of more time-consuming work to allow them to seek or train for better jobs.
1.3.7.1.1.3. Pro: Americans without at least a Bachelor's degree earn usually less than the average American worker; the [median income](https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2016/data-on-display/education-matters.htm) of a worker with at least a Bachelor's degree is statistically almost twice that of someone with only a high school degree. The solution for the problems of the low-educated therefore lie in education, not in access to drug trials.
1.3.7.1.2. Con: Even assuming technical feasibility, it is simply not realistic to expect that governments will magically provide for all the needs of the poor. In a nonideal world, then, giving them the option of earning money through trials can be good.
1.3.7.1.3. Con: The government can never [fully eliminate unemployment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rate_of_unemployment) Given, furthermore, that long-term structural unemployment and wage stagnation [are being increasingly created through mechanization](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/robots), some level of poverty in society is inevitable.
1.3.7.1.3.1. Con: Governments, however, can provide social security to ensure that people don't have to do drug trials to survive.
1.3.7.1.3.1.1. Con: Because disincentives to work must be avoided, social security payments will never be large enough to provide for all of an individual's needs, and people will always be pushed towards drug trials as a source of income.
1.3.7.2. Pro: All societies have people with little or no education, experience or training of the kind needed to get "good" jobs. They need legal ways to earn money.
1.3.7.3. Pro: People who have lost their job or are otherwise desperate for money can use drug trials to tide them over temporarily.
1.3.7.3.1. Pro: Drug trials offer a form of 'passive income' where participants have a large degree of free time which they can use for childcare, education, or job hunting.
1.3.7.3.1.1. Con: Many trials are [live-in](http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/09/life-of-a-professional-guinea-pig/406018/), and even when they are not, they can significantly restrict the ability to engage in such activities, by requiring regular check-ins and supervised dosages or check-ups.
1.3.7.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.3.8. Pro: Desperate people [enter](http://retractionwatch.com/2015/09/23/heres-how-to-keep-clinical-trial-participants-honest-and-why-thats-a-big-deal/) multiple clinical trials at once, or lie about their history of entering trials in an attempt to get more money. This is very, very dangerous.
1.3.8.1. Pro: Interactions between medications can skew results of both trials.
1.3.8.2. Pro: New medications do not yet have sufficient information about their interactions with other medications. If participants are taking multiple experimental drugs at once, there can be serious [health risks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19104209).
1.3.8.3. Pro: This would be even easier to prevent if there was a single central authority, such as the FDA, in charge of selecting participants and ensuring that no one takes part in more than one drug trial.
1.3.8.4. Con: This could be prevented by creating a national clinical trial patient registry, as suggested by the [reference](http://retractionwatch.com/2015/09/23/heres-how-to-keep-clinical-trial-participants-honest-and-why-thats-a-big-deal/) linked in the parent. There is no need to select drug trial participants randomly.
1.3.9. Con: Many people are paid, at least in part, for putting themselves in danger. For example, crab fishing is a dangerous job and many fishermen make [six-figure salaries](http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/27/pf/jobs/crab-fishing-dangerous-jobs/) annually.
1.3.9.1. Con: Yes, we allow people to take risks for compensation, but we make sure these are consensual decisions. Choosing to work in a dangerous industry is far more likely to be consensual than choosing to engage in a clinical trial for compensation.
1.3.9.1.1. Pro: Working in a dangerous industry requires substantial time spent acquiring the necessary skills and resources. The choice to do so is thus unlikely to be a spur-of-the-moment one driven by necessity.
1.3.9.1.2. Pro: It is easier to acquire knowledge about the risks associated with an entire, long-established industry than it is to acquire knowledge about a one-off trial. Better-informed choices are more consensual.
1.3.10. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.4. Con: This policy would create perverse incentives for people.
1.4.1. Pro: Just as some people in the US fled to Canada or elsewhere to avoid the Vietnam draft, some people would leave the country rather than risk their life or health as experimental subjects.
1.4.1.1. Con: The minuscule probability of being selected for and harmed by a medical trial is simply incomparable to the Vietnam draft. The probability is so small that it would not cause anyone to leave the country.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: People with rare conditions or a rare combination of conditions might be pretty likely to be selected, as the pool of potential trial participants is relatively small.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: While it seems unlikely that many people would leave the country simply because mandatory trials were implemented, there's a higher chance that individuals who have been selected would leave rather than be forced to take a drug \(especially one that hasn't been approved\).
1.4.1.1.3. Con: The chance of getting selected for a medical trial would be about as high as was the chance of being drafted for the Vietnam War. Every year, about 7.7% of America's adult population \([Shamoo, p. 207](https://www.mcmaster.ca/ors/ethics/ncehr/2003/oct2003/Adverse%20Events%20Reporting%20Acc%20Res%202001.pdf)\) participate as subjects in human research. The share of eligible men drafted during the Vietnam War stood at 8.3% \([Rostker, p. 45](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2007/RAND_MG265.pdf)\).
1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: It is likely that the number and sample size of medical trials would increase once the policy proposed here is implemented. This would further increase the likelihood of being selected for participation in a trial.
1.4.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.4.
1.4.1.1.4. Pro: [One in 185](https://gizmodo.com/5774387/what-were-a-us-soldiers-odds-of-dying-in-every-war) American soldiers deployed in Vietnam did not come back alive. Medical trials are presumably much safer.
1.4.1.2. Con: As stated in the topology, the pool of individuals would be entirely comprised of people with the disease in question. Therefore, their lives and health are already compromised. The risk of further injury or quicker death would be weighed by probability of success of each drug or treatment.
1.4.2. Con: The fact that perverse incentives may arise isn't by itself a sufficient reason to oppose a policy.
1.4.2.1. Con: If the perverse incentives cause concrete harm to a particular country \(for example, by causing people to leave\) or harm individuals \(by causing them to conceal medical conditions\) then that certainly provides a consideration against implementation of the policy.
1.4.3. Pro: Citizens would have an interest in hiding their medical conditions in order to not be identified when people are being selected for a trial.
1.4.3.1. Pro: As a result, doctors and other medical professionals would be incentivized to not report the conditions of patients to the authorities in charge in exchange for bribes or out of a sense of moral duty.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: This would only happen if the medical professionals are either corrupt or opposed to the policy.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: If the medical professionals are corrupt enough to accept bribes, the issue lies within the medical field, not the policy.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: Given that the consequences of being caught engaging in this deception would be incredibly high \(being fired, possible [suspension of medical license](http://rosenblumlawfirm.com/doctors-and-the-law-how-can-a-criminal-conviction-affect-the-practice-of-medicine/) - which would destroy a doctor's career\), doctors would be unwilling to do so.
1.4.3.1.1.3. Con: Many doctors plausibly would be opposed to the policy.
1.4.3.2. Con: On the contrary, this might also give an incentive to citizens to share their medical conditions, as they could expect to be selected for a treatment that benefits them.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Patients who would like to receive experimental treatments would likely have already volunteered for trials under the status quo, so this will not add any extra incentive to report their condition.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: Not everyone who thinks about volunteering ends up doing so. Having a national obligation would create trust and the willingness to participate.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Con: In the status quo, volunteers oftentimes have to find out about suitable trials and apply for them on their own. A lack of knowledge about available trials therefore prevents people from signing up, which would not happen under the policy proposed here due to centralized allocation.
1.4.3.2.2. Con: Patients who want a cure for a condition generally report it to doctors anyway.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Other forms of involuntary service \([the draft](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/25/america-wealthy-class-betrayed-inequality), [taxes](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/business/economy/for-the-wealthiest-private-tax-system-saves-them-billions.html), and [jury duty](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-do-i-avoid-jury-duty-2013-12)\) are dodged by the rich, the powerful, and/or the sneaky. The same thing would happen with forced participation in drug trials.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: Though some people might manage to avoid service, it is not clear why this should mean that the entire system, which most people commit to, becomes principally unfair.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: If the system becomes unfair because some people dodge it, then enforcing stricter measures to make it harder to avoid doing your duty seems to be a more reasonable option than not doing the policy at all.
1.4.3.4. Con: In order to hide their condition they would either have to convince their doctor to not report once they've been diagnosed, break into the hospital and delete their medical records or stop going to the hospital when they get ill. All of these seem highly unlikely.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: While this may be true, citizens might actually be encouraged to not even seek help for their conditions if they have to assume that this could get them added to a pool of trial participants.
1.4.3.4.2. Con: If people don’t want to share their data, there would be a way. People with enough money could schedule their medical appointments in other countries or bribe private doctors.
1.4.3.4.2.1. Con: That would be incredibly expensive, and it is unlikely that most would be able to afford this.
1.4.3.4.2.2. Pro: This would particularly favour the rich, who would be most able to afford this.
1.4.3.5. Con: Any reasonable person would understand that they'd face a larger health risk by not revealing their condition and going untreated than by risking the possible side effects of a drug test that could cure them.
1.4.3.5.1. Con: Many people are [irrationally afraid](http://time.com/3701543/measles-vaccines-poll-anti-vaxxers/) of mysterious medical procedures, a fear which would be far more intense if the procedure was experimental. In many cases, this might be sufficient to cause someone to conceal a medical condition by leaving it untreated.
1.4.3.5.1.1. Pro: People suffer from [optimism bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias), which might cause them to underestimate the probability that leaving the condition untreated will turn out badly. By contrast, the bias is overriden in cases of irrational fear, like fears of terrorism or, in this case, of the drug trials.
1.4.3.5.2. Con: Many conditions do not pose a significant health risk but are merely inconvenient, from migraines to erectile dysfunction. Patients who want to avoid being added to the pool of those with the condition in question might choose a life with this inconvenience over seeking help.
1.5. Pro: This policy would make drug trials safer for participants.
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.2.
1.5.2. Con: In the status quo, companies need to convince participants that it is safe for them to participate, and worth it for the reward offered. This would remove these considerations, making it more likely that companies take lightly the decision to go to human trial stage.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Removing the need to market a trial and recruit volunteers makes drug trials cheaper for pharmaceutical companies.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: This may make drug companies less inclined to [shelve](http://www.nature.com/news/new-cures-sought-from-old-drugs-1.11510) promising but expensive \(or less profitable\) drugs.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Because participants would be forced to participate by law, drug trials would be seen as a government-run activity. This makes any risks or downsides to a trial reflect poorly on the government, not the company, and can encourage more risky trials to be setup.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: Alternatively, companies may fear increased government oversight as a result of more direct government involvement, and, as such, behave more cautiously.
1.5.2.3. Con: The FDA maintains safeguards that ensure drugs going to human trial are safe enough to do so.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: The FDA has been accused of [covering up evidence of botched drug trials](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/02/fda_inspections_fraud_fabrication_and_scientific_misconduct_are_hidden_from.html), even those that put trial subjects at serious risk.
1.5.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.2.
1.5.2.5. Pro: Without the need to obtain participants' consent there is less of an incentive for drug companies to fully document and disclose the possible risks involved in a trial.
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.3.
1.5.4. Pro: If a country has mandatory participation, the media will pay more attention to the system, including its failings, thus increasing transparency and accountability.
1.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.6.1.
1.5.5. Con: This policy would actually only be safer for those who already volunteered to be in trials. For those who are chosen now, being in a trial against their will is much less safe than not being in a trial at all.
1.5.6. Pro: To help ease the public's unease with mandatory trials, the government would presumably make the process fairly transparent, perhaps with a website detailing every drug trial.
1.5.6.1. Con: This claim relies on the assumption that problems in the process are simply due to regulation and supervision. In reality there are systemic issues \(such as unpredictability of drug interactions\) that no amount of transparency can resolve.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: The claim that more transparency will make drug trials safer is based on the assumption that some of the problems are procedural. These particular problems would indeed be lessened by transparency. The problems that are inherent in drug trials are just that - inherent - and of course can never be resolved.
1.5.7. Con: When selecting people from more diverse demographics, drug trials - particularly harmful ones - are more likely to generate a backlash against a drug company. This would have a chilling effect on the use of drug trials that are risky but highly promising.
1.5.7.1. Pro: In the status quo, many of those who volunteer for trials do so for financial reasons, and are thus likely to belong to demographics that lack political power and influence. Randomly selected participants would be more likely to include people from more privileged socioeconomic backgrounds.
1.5.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.1.5.
1.5.7.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.5.7.2. Con: Presumably the participants selected for 'risky yet promising' trials would have the kind of diseases that justify risky treatments; i.e. those that are often terminal.
1.5.7.2.1. Con: Whether a terminal disease justifies a risky treatment, many of which come with severe side-effects, should be up to the patient. Some people might prefer to not prolong their lives, especially if this would come with side-effects or pain.
1.5.7.2.2. Con: This would not always be true: the first phase of human trials, to determine safe dosage levels, are often conducted in healthy patients.
1.5.7.3. Pro: By selecting for a more diverse group of people these trials are also drawing in a more diverse and broad secondary network composed of participant's friends and families. News of any trial mishaps will thus spread through more diverse social networks.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.
1.7. Con: This policy would agitate the public.
1.7.1. Pro: It is important that the state can justify overriding fundamental rights and freedoms in an acceptable way to the public. People are unlikely to accept the justification for the removal of consent through this policy.
1.7.1.1. Con: If people are taught to understand the necessity and the benefits of this policy, they are likely to support it.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: People generally have a strong disposition towards opposing policies that create perceived rights violations even if they generate utilitarian benefits. This means that rationally illustrating the potential benefits of the policy is unlikely to override people's intuitive opposition to it.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: One example of this is the opposition to explicit [healthcare rationing](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-katz-md/health-care-rationing-the-roar-and-the-silence_b_7817194.html) in the US, which ignited a popular frenzy around supposed "[death panels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel)."
1.7.1.1.1.2. Pro: As of 2014, [three out of four](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/29/what-americans-think-about-nsa-surveillance-national-security-and-privacy/) Americans were unwilling to sacrifice civil liberties and their privacy for measures that are supposed to increase their safety, for example surveillance.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Policies that the people find invasive and/or unfair will generate distrust, which leads to a perception that the government is abusive and/or incompetent.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: Distrust of the government worsens interactions between the state and its citizens.
1.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: If the people don't trust the state to govern them fairly, they're less likely to follow and respect laws.
1.7.1.2.1.2. Pro: If the people think that their government is incompetent, they're likely to choose to use private services over services provided by the state such as putting kids in private schools or going to private hospitals when sick.
1.7.1.2.2. Con: Distrust of the government can also result from inadequate provision of [healthcare](https://today.yougov.com/news/2013/11/07/americans-distrust-government-health-care-involvem/). Insofar as this policy improves the process of drug production and therefore makes drugs more effective and accessible and people's healthcare experiences better, it can indirectly increase trust in the state.
1.7.1.2.2.1. Con: Even if the policy proves effective, the benefits would neither have effects nor be visible in the short run.
1.7.1.2.2.1.1. Con: The majority of people would not be directly affected by this policy, but they would be exposed to positive media coverage of instances where the policy produce benefits. As such, their perception of the policy would be positive overall.
1.7.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Alternatively, they could hear occasional horror stories of accidents in clinical trials and thus come to oppose the policy.
1.7.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Indeed, such horror stories may become more common - if companies no longer need to worry about trial subjects withdrawing from trials they deem too invasive, risky or painful, they may conduct trials that otherwise would not occur thanks to these problems, creating more negative stories.
1.7.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Quantifying the benefits of this policy is nearly impossible. Due to the huge variety of other factors affecting rates of illness, isolating the impacts of compulsory trial participation would be incredibly difficult.
1.7.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Only [about one in ten](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-success-idUSTRE71D2U920110214) drugs that is being tested in trials ever receives FDA approval. Even if the policy would make drug trials more effective, many of them would have no publicly visible benefit.
1.7.1.2.3. Con: If people become more exposed to details about medical trials, and therefore come to realize that they are in fact quite safe and efficient, it is unlikely that there will be substantial anger regarding this policy.
1.7.1.2.3.1. Con: Clinical trials are dangerous.
1.7.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: The general perception of clinical trials' risk is too optimistic due to [publication bias](https://www.drugwatch.com/manufacturer/clinical-trials-and-hidden-data/): results of trials that indicate that a drug is dangerous or ineffective are not usually published.
1.7.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Fewer than half](http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090911/full/news.2009.902.html) of the trials conducted in the US are registered in a governmental repository, and fewer than half of those have their results published in peer-reviewed journals.
1.7.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Between 2005 and 2012 at least [2,644](http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/11/over-2500-deaths-during-indian-clinical-trials/) clinical trial-related deaths were counted in India by the government.
1.7.1.2.3.1.2.1. Con: As the article [notes](http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/11/over-2500-deaths-during-indian-clinical-trials/), the vast majority of these were people with fatal illnesses who merely died during the course of the trial. Only 89 died directly because of the trial.
1.7.1.2.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Health rights forums have [challenged](http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/11/over-2500-deaths-during-indian-clinical-trials/) this figure - no protocols were followed and there were no post-mortems, so it is possible that the actual figure of trial-caused deaths is much higher.
1.7.1.2.3.1.2.2. Con: India is a country with a less developed health system and less effective regulatory system.
1.7.1.2.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.2.3.
1.7.1.2.3.1.4. Con: Drugs that make it to the last-stage of medical trials have been tested for years, and are safe to be tested on humans.
1.7.1.2.3.1.4.1. Pro: A new cancer drug needs to be studied and tested in labs for about 6 years before being admitted to clinical trials. \([American Cancer Society, p. 2](http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/003006-pdf.pdf)\)
1.7.1.2.3.1.4.2. Pro: The Principles of Good Clinical Practices \(GCPs\) and adequate Human Subject Protection \(HSP\), globally recognised as a prerequisite for involving human subjects in research, [ensure the safety](http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/) of humans in trials.
1.7.1.2.3.1.4.2.1. Con: The [GCPs](http://www.gcp-education.com/) still allow for test subjects to be exposed to harsh side effects so long as they give informed consent.
1.7.1.2.3.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: This policy will still violate the GCPs as it denies the right to decline participation.
1.7.1.2.3.1.4.3. Con: Even drugs that make it to public release are not necessarily safe for humans. Every year in the US, there are [thousands of deaths](http://www.alternet.org/story/147318/100,000_americans_die_each_year_from_prescription_drugs,_while_pharma_companies_get_rich) and [1.9 million hospitalizations](http://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/new-prescription-drugs-major-health-risk-few-offsetting-advantages) caused by properly taking prescription drugs; some drugs are [recalled](http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus/News/2014/08/11/20005/Number-of-Drug-Recalls-Surges-at-FDA-Led-by-Mid-Level-Concerns/) or [discontinued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_withdrawn_drugs); many more [have safety warnings added](http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/Safety-RelatedDrugLabelingChanges/default.htm) months or years after release; and manufacturers are [sued](https://www.drugwatch.com/2016/01/21/top-5-big-pharma-verdicts-settlements-in-2015/).
1.7.1.2.3.1.4.4. Con: Even if a drug has been tested and analyzed by experts before reaching the stage where humans get involved, it's impossible to anticipate all bad reactions, which is why safety cannot be assured.
1.7.1.2.3.1.4.5. Con: Logically, the safety requirements of drugs that make it into market is higher than the safety requirements of drugs that make it into human-stage drug tests. Drugs with severe side effects that have been put into market have undergone and passed the final stage of drug tests, meaning that the test subjects of those trials had to endure those side effects.
1.7.1.2.3.1.5. Pro: Even in countries with highly developed medical systems and trial regulations, [serious incidents occur](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/the-drug-trials-that-went-wrong-a6814696.html).
1.7.1.2.3.1.5.1. Pro: A French drug trial that caused a death and several cases of serious brain damage [involved a drug that had resulted in deaths and brain damage in dogs](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/25/french-drug-trial-scandal-dogs-died-in-pre-clinical-test) in previous animal model tests.
1.7.1.2.3.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.3.1.
1.7.1.2.3.2. Con: Public opposition to the policy might be based not only on the potential harm that medical trials pose, but also on moral issues such as the extent of the state's authority and the inconveniences that the policy imposes on trial participants.
1.7.1.2.3.3. Con: Late-stage medical trials can be invasive or risky, and have a substantial disruptive effect on participants' lives. It is crucial that participants be freely consenting.
1.7.1.2.3.3.1. Con: There is a high degree of risk in medical trials. People cannot fully consent to these dangers because they have [an optimism bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias) that leads them to systemically underestimate risks.
1.7.1.2.3.3.1.1. Con: People still make a conscious decision to some degree in the status quo and can thus give some form of consent. This policy would remove choice and consent entirely.
1.7.1.2.3.3.2. Con: Current volunteers might superficially consent but in fact they are forced to partake by urgent reasons, e.g. their financial situation.
1.7.1.2.3.3.2.1. Con: Consenting because of financial considerations should not be seen as a compromised form of consent. When people work or purchase items they are consenting to perform an activity for money.
1.7.1.2.3.3.2.2. Pro: Offering financial rewards [increases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4364332/) [the](http://jme.bmj.com/content/30/3/293.full) willingness of potential participants to respond and enroll.
1.7.1.2.3.3.2.3. Con: This is still a greater level of consent than someone randomly selected would have.
1.7.1.2.3.3.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.7.1.2.3.3.2.5. Pro: The [vast](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02336681) [majority](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/322920) of those who have participated in medical trials state the financial rewards as the main incentive to do so.
1.7.1.2.3.3.2.5.1. Con: An interest in the financial rewards for participation in drug trials does not mean that the participants in question are actually in urgent need of this money. It might simply be a more convenient source of income than the alternatives.
1.7.1.2.3.3.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.7.1.2.3.3.2.7. Con: There are other reasons for volunteers to participate, for example to serve society.
1.7.1.2.3.3.3. Pro: For example, some medical trials can require that people live under supervision for days, weeks or even months, taking them away from families, jobs, and plans.
1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1. Con: Presumably, there would be exceptions for people for whom this would be a significant impediment, just like there is for jury duty or military service.
1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: In the United States, the military draft usually exempts [certain elected officials](https://www.sss.gov/About/Return-to-the-Draft/Postponements-Deferments-Exemptions) as well as men with a family and/or children [dependent](http://legalbeagle.com/5256842-exempt-being-drafted-military.html) on them or a job in an industry relevant for national security.
1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.2. Con: Were this to be the case, this would likely quickly become a proxy for general socio-economic advantage, allowing those with well-paying but high-commitment jobs to skip trials in much the same way that similar people are often permitted to skip jury duty.
1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.2.1. Con: To the contrary, jobs vital to the public interest, like those of teachers or police officers, tend to be lower-paying, whilst higher-paying jobs like those in business or academia would not receive exceptions.
1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.2.1.1. Con: As many people are in positions vital to the public interest, for example teachers and police officers, a great number of people might be excluded if exceptions are made
1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.
1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.3. Con: Given the large sample size requirement some trials have, allowing exceptions would make it very hard to find a sufficient pool of participants.
1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: This is particularly true when the relevant conditions are rare.
1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.2.1.1.
1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.4. Con: Insofar as religious or moral exemptions are correlated with certain social characteristics which may be medically relevant, allowing exemptions would drastically reduce the benefits of having more representative samples of the population.
1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.4.1. Pro: For example, African-Americans and Hispanic people are [more likely to be religious](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/chapter-4-the-shifting-religious-identity-of-demographic-groups/), and vegetarians and vegans are [more likely to be young](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/12/01/the-new-food-fights/ps_2016-12-01_food-science_1-07/).
1.7.1.2.3.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.1.
1.7.1.2.3.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.3.4.
1.7.1.2.3.3.6. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.1.4.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7. Con: Like citizens are liable to military service, they can be randomly chosen to serve their nation by partaking in medical trials.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.1. Pro: During the Vietnam War, the American government even [conducted lotteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_lottery_\(1969\)) to randomly determine the order of call to military service for men born in certain years.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.2. Con: Military drafts can be justified when putting people on the line is necessary for the protection and survival of the state. If the state isn't protected, it cannot ensure its citizens' fundamental rights. Military drafts is therefore an invalid comparison as that is not the case with drug trials.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.3. Con: Even if there is no morally significant distinction between conscription and forced trials, conscription itself is arguably a violation of civil liberties or human rights.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.3.1. Pro: Conscription forces people to expose themselves to fatal dangers and to engage in actions which they may be unwilling to do or be strongly morally opposed to. This is clearly unethical.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.4. Con: Military drafts happen only under extreme circumstances. \(They don't even happen during every war, e.g. Gulf War, Iraq, Afghanistan\). The prospect of being forcibly drugged would be a universal, ongoing feature of US life.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.4.1. Con: The ultimate well-being of all citizens is a very good reason for a mandatory draft. Medicines would be developed faster if researchers had enough participants for their trials, ultimately leading to lowered global mortality rates due to diseases.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.5. Con: While the draft is about protecting the existence of the US and all its citizens, forced medical trials would benefit only narrow segments of the population \(e.g. those with epilepsy, heart conditions, allergies, etc.\).
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.5.1. Con: Presumably, only those who are affected by certain conditions would be part of the respective trials. The trials would therefore benefit precisely those who have the most to gain from them.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.7.2.2.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.5.2. Con: [Half](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/) of US adults have chronic health conditions, and almost all will be seriously ill at some point in their lives, so much more than a narrow segment of the population stands to gain from improved medical research.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.6. Con: This leads to a slippery slope wherein living people could be used for car-crash tests, military explosives testing, and other activities that are for "the greater good."
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.6.1. Con: Living people do not seem to be necessary test subjects for any of those things.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.7. Con: We needed a draft in order to make sure we had enough soldiers because volunteers were not enough. We have enough volunteers for medical studies.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.4.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.8. Pro: Mandatory participation in drug trials is principally similar to the military draft: individual sacrifices, even difficult experiences, are expected for the benefit of society as a whole.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.9. Con: Military drafts are employed when there are insufficient voluntary recruits to meet an existential threat. That is not the case here.
1.7.1.2.3.3.7.9.1. Con: While diseases do not threaten the nation as such, they are devastating for its people. In 2016, cancer alone killed [more Americans](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics) than the two World Wars and the Vietnam War [combined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war).
1.7.1.2.4. Con: It is unclear why, simply because people believe the government has acted badly in one specific area, they will come to generally distrust all government services.
1.7.1.3. Pro: Making drug trials mandatory would be widely perceived as a huge government favor to the pharmaceutical industry \("Big Pharma"\) at the expense of the public's rights and freedoms.
1.7.2. Pro: Forcing people to take drugs is a violation of human rights and civil liberties.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Cultural and/or religious views and beliefs may be disregarded in order for individuals to participate.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Some cultures are [wary](http://www.dimensionsofculture.com/2011/03/cultural-barriers-to-treatment-and-compliance/) of western medicine and do not fully trust the updated methods of treatment.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Minorities like the [Hmong](http://www.dimensionsofculture.com/2012/01/providing-healthcare-to-hmong-patients-and-families/) have cultural beliefs that oftentimes limit their willingness to accept certain treatments, for example immunizations or blood transfusions.
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: Many do not support the use of contraceptives, for example conservative Catholics, but might be called up to participate in a trial of them.
1.7.2.1.3. Pro: Vegans would be morally opposed to taking any medication containing animal ingredients \(or medication that has been tested on animals\).
1.7.2.1.4. Con: The system could be set up to excuse people based on pre-existing cultural and/or religious beliefs on a case-by-case basis.
1.7.2.1.4.1. Con: This risks allowing too many people to use this excuse to avoid the trial. Suppose we were to grant exceptions to vegans - anyone could pretend to be a principled vegan. This would then defeat the purpose of the policy, as the only subjects would be people already willing to undergo the trial.
1.7.2.1.4.2. Con: It is unclear why these beliefs should be considered to be legitimate justifications against being forced to take drugs when other concerns aren't.
1.7.2.1.4.3. Pro: The US has a long history of allowing individual exemptions on religious or conscientious grounds.
1.7.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: Peyote use is legal for the Native American Church.
1.7.2.1.4.3.2. Pro: Quakers, Amish, and Mennonites are allowed non-military service if drafted.
1.7.2.1.4.3.3. Pro: People can refuse to have their children vaccinated on grounds of [religious or "philosophical" beliefs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15568260), among others.
1.7.2.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.4.
1.7.2.1.4.5. Pro: Such individuals could simply be reallocated to the next available trial that does not violate their personal, cultural or religious beliefs.
1.7.2.1.5. Pro: Many Buddhists and Hindus are vegetarian/vegan, which would rule out some medications, while Muslims must avoid pork-based ingredients \(many gelatins\) and alcohol \(e.g. [numerous liquid medications](http://www.sdsuduip.com/medications-containing-alcohol/) for cough, allergies, diarrhea, and pain\).
1.7.2.1.6. Pro: The Church of [Christian Science](http://www.religioustolerance.org/medical2.htm) and Jehovah's Witnesses are two of many [Christian groups](http://www.religioustolerance.org/medical8.htm) who refuse medical treatment for religious reasons.
1.7.2.2. Con: Humans have not only rights, but also duties. The mandatory participation in medical trials that benefit the whole society should be one of these duties.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: Justifying the violation of a certain right through invocation of the utilitarian "greater good" makes the entire enterprise of human rights nonsensical. The precise nature of rights is that they protect individuals against being used for the benefit of the wider population, and rights against intrusive medical treatment are some of the [strongest rights we recognise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Connor_v._Donaldson).
1.7.2.2.1.1. Con: The existence of taxation, which technically violates property rights, does not necessitate that we get rid of the idea of human rights in general. In limited circumstances, we can create clearly defined justifiable violations of rights.
1.7.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Arguably, property rights are [socially constructed](http://www.philosophyetc.net/2006/05/property-is-unnatural.html) and therefore violations of them are more readily acceptable, whilst the right against forced medical intervention is natural and therefore absolute.
1.7.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: For example, John Rawls, widely considered the [most influential](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2002/11/john-rawls-influential-political-philosopher-dead-at-81/) political philosopher of the last century, includes a variety of basic liberties and rights in his conception of justice, but not a [right to property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice#The_First_Principle_of_Justice).
1.7.2.2.1.1.2. Con: The freedom from arbitrary deprivation of liberty and the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment are higher goods than property rights. These are [non-derogable rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency#Relationship_with_international_law) that, even in a state of emergency, cannot be suspended.
1.7.2.2.2. Con: Even if we concede that the state can justifiably demand of individuals that they make sacrifices for the greater good, it doesn't seem like this is the precise sacrifice it should be asking for, as asking for other sacrifices instead could create far more benefit.
1.7.2.2.2.1. Pro: For example, making charitable donations or charity work compulsory would result in far more general benefit than this policy.
1.7.2.2.2.2. Pro: Other examples of compulsory duties that could generate more good than this policy include mandatory opt-in for organ donations or mandatory vaccinations.
1.7.2.2.2.3. Con: Drugs for diseases such as cancer or Alzheimer's would have a massively positive impact that no other form of individual sacrifice but participation in trials can deliver.
1.7.2.2.2.3.1. Con: There's an incredibly low probability that the marginal impact this policy will have makes the difference between discovering and not discovering a cure to cancer.
1.7.2.2.3. Pro: Insofar as citizens want to participate in and benefit from the institution of medical treatment, they should be expected to "give back" to that institution and help it improve.
1.7.2.2.3.1. Con: Those who profit from healthcare already give back to the system by paying taxes, insurance premiums and, where necessary, the price of drugs and other medical services.
1.7.2.2.3.2. Con: Everyone benefits from the safety provided by a country's military. Yet the vast majority of countries have moved away from compulsory service let alone random ballots.
1.7.2.2.4. Pro: Duties that require individual sacrifice for the greater good are well-established.
1.7.2.2.4.1. Pro: In countries like Switzerland and Germany the participation in fire services [is mandatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_Fire_Service) in some regions and towns.
1.7.2.2.4.2. Pro: Some countries and regions made vaccinations for children [compulsory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_policy#Compulsory_vaccination). According to [one study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/02/25/peds.2013-0698), the vaccination of one American birth cohort will prevent some 42,000 deaths and save society around $69 billion.
1.7.2.2.4.2.1. Con: This involves little to no individual sacrifice.
1.7.2.2.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.3.7.
1.7.2.3. Pro: Forced drugging and medical experimentation is a hallmark of dictatorships, including the [Soviet Union](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/14/us/psychiatric-abuse-in-soviet-assailed.html), [Nazi Germany](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005168), and [Imperial Japan](http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3588&context=etd).
1.7.2.3.1. Pro: There have also been incidences of the practice [in liberal democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala_syphilis_experiment), instances that were later widely condemned.
1.7.2.3.2. Con: Our sense of moral outrage at these examples is likely much exacerbated by the [horrible and invasive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation) nature of the procedures, so we should not take this outrage as indicative that violations of consent are, in general, abhorrent \(though that may still be true\).
1.7.2.3.2.1. Pro: One example of a policy that violates medical consent but doesn't trigger horrified reactions is compulsory vaccination - in fact, a Supreme Court ruling [upheld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts) compulsory vaccination laws as constitutional.
1.7.2.4. Pro: [Informed consent](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/informed-consent/) is a foundational concept in medical ethics, and its status as an absolute principle needs to be guarded unconditionally.
1.7.2.4.1. Pro: The requirement of informed consent often forces doctors to go against the course of action they believe is best for the patient. As such, the temptation for doctors to violate the principle is high, and they may begin doing so if we start justifying exceptions.
1.7.2.4.1.1. Pro: For example, doctors may intentionally neglect to tell patients certain courses of action, or they may coercively pressure them into certain options.
1.7.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: It is difficult to enforce against these sorts of violations, and under the status quo we rely on the commitment of doctors to the principle of informed consent in order to prevent them from doing this.
1.7.2.4.1.2. Con: It is difficult to see how a violation of informed consent on a large-scale, institutional level affects the behavior of doctors and patients in individual interactions.
1.7.2.4.1.2.1. Con: The behavior of doctors in individual cases is influenced by their commitment to a broad medical practice of prioritizing informed consent above all else. Violating that broad practice on an institutional level would destroy its sanctity.
1.7.2.4.1.2.2. Pro: If this policy is seen as originating from the government, rather than health institutions themselves, there is no reason why individuals should come to distrust their individual health providers.
1.7.2.4.1.2.2.1. Con: When citizens are interacting with the research institutions and healthcare industry as a result of this policy, it is those institutions that they will see as the face of it.
1.7.2.4.1.2.3. Con: When a policy is seen as violable in general - and, indeed, on a widespread scale - it is easier for individual doctors interacting with it to also see the cases they come across as justifying exceptions.
1.7.2.4.2. Pro: Informed consent is vital for building bonds of [trust](http://www.mlegal.fmed.edu.uy/archivos/be/bcc1/trust_and_autonomy.pdf) between patients and the medical system. Consistent violations of informed consent through implementation of this policy could shatter those bonds of trust.
1.7.2.4.2.1. Con: If the policy improves the process of creation of new drugs, and thus indirectly improves the quality of medical care, trust and positive engagement with the medical system can increase.
1.7.2.4.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.2.1.3.
1.7.2.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.7.2.4.1.2.
1.7.2.4.3. Con: Informed consent is valid for clinical practices where it guides the interaction of individuals. It makes less sense to apply this standard to wide-scale health policy, where individual choices are often overridden for the greater good.
1.7.2.5. Pro: The policy proposed would violate national law and international agreements.
1.7.2.5.1. Pro: The article prescribing the prohibition of torture in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that ‘no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation.’ Thus, there exists an international consensus that involuntary medical experimentation constitutes torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. \([FRA, 23](http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/2130-FRA-2012-involuntary-placement-treatment_EN.pdf)\)
1.7.2.5.2. Pro: US courts [have repeatedly ruled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary_treatment#United_States) that forced drugging can happen only in very narrow, extreme circumstances and often requires a court order.
1.7.2.5.2.1. Pro: In the rare cases it is allowed, this is because a person is presenting an immediate risk of harm to themselves or others.
1.7.2.6. Pro: In this case, the state is removing citizens' autonomy over their own body while unable to guarantee that it will provide any clear benefits to society. This is therefore unfair.
1.7.2.6.1. Pro: It is vital that a state can justify demanding certain duties of their citizens. This becomes even more important when imposing a duty comes at the expense of individuals rights.
1.7.2.6.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.
1.7.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.3.
1.7.2.8. Pro: At the Nuremberg "Doctor's Trial" \(United States v. Karl Brandt et al.\), the US judges found that with respect to "medical experiments on human beings", "The voluntary consent  of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the interventions   of any elements of force, fraud, deceit, duress..." [sskrplaw.com](https://www.sskrplaw.com/files/dignity.pdf)
1.7.3. Con: As only a small minority of citizens would actually be affected by this policy, the outcry is likely to be relatively small.
1.7.3.1. Con: While precise numbers are hard to come by, it has been estimated that some 19 million Americans participate in medical research per year \([Shamoo, p. 207](https://www.mcmaster.ca/ors/ethics/ncehr/2003/oct2003/Adverse%20Events%20Reporting%20Acc%20Res%202001.pdf)\).
1.7.3.1.1. Con: This policy will make drug trials more effective and accurate, which will reduce the number of trials that will occur.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: As the organizers of drug trials would not have to worry about a lack of participants anymore, more drugs could be tested and larger trials be conducted. The number of those affected would thus likely be larger than is the case today.
1.7.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.4.
1.7.3.1.1.1.2. Con: The fact that many medical trials fail currently means that further testing is necessary. Since this policy would mean that more medical trials succeed, fewer trials will be required to finish the testing of drugs. This is supported by studies, which suggest that optimizing the selection of participants could prevent many [phase III trials](http://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/phase-iii-trial-failures-costly-preventable?pageID=4) that currently fail.
1.7.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This would still involve more participants in trials.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: You do not need to have participated in a drug trial as a human subject in order to form an attachment big enough to feel affected by this policy. The 19 million people who participate annually in medical research are likely to have an ongoing interest in policies in this area beyond their active participation period.
1.7.3.2. Con: -> See 1.7.3.1.1.1.
1.7.3.3. Con: It is important to remember that the number "affected" is actually much larger than the number who would be forced to participate. Participants' families, friends, colleagues, employers, and others will also be affected to some degree, leading to more of an outcry.
1.7.3.3.1. Con: These extended groups will only be affected if the trials actually result in adverse consequences for the subject, which is highly unlikely. In the majority of instances, the only "impact" on a subject's family or friends will be that the subject is perhaps absent for a few hours, undertaking the trial, or has to report back regularly.
1.7.3.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.3.
1.7.3.3.2. Pro: Even if the person they know who has been forced to participate does not suffer, they may be outraged on their behalf, or feel more threatened by the possibility of being forced to participate themselves in the future.
1.7.3.4. Pro: Governments often don't fully address the concerns of those who make up a very small percentage of the population \(such as indigenous people's water, land, and economic rights\).
1.7.3.4.1. Con: Citizens who are not members of minorities usually have little reason to care about their treatment. The policy proposed here, in contrast to that, is of relevance to every member of society due to the chance of being chosen for a trial.
1.7.3.5. Con: Even if the number of those who would be affected is small, the knowledge that you could be forced to participate is likely to generate large outcry in the media.
1.7.4. Con: That people may get angry is something that needs to be dealt with, but it's not a reason against introducing a policy if the policy could help millions of people get access to better medicine.
1.7.4.1. Pro: The [Affordable Care Act](https://www.medicaid.gov/affordable-care-act/index.html) has provided millions of American citizens with healthcare even though many people [dislike](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/05/news/economy/why-people-hate-obamacare/) it because they find it invasive.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: In fact, most specific provisions of the law are [very popular](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/rampage/wp/2017/01/06/what-americans-really-think-about-obamacare/?utm_term=.98316cada2a9) - so it does not seem possible for a policy to be simultaneously successful and effective, but unpopular. People simply dislike the label "Obamacare" because of its political ramifications, and this has led to a mistaken perception that the ACA is unpopular.
1.7.4.2. Con: Implementing a policy that is supposedly beneficial for the general population despite widespread opposition to it violates the principles of democratic governance, and is an extreme form of [paternalism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paternalism/).
1.7.4.3. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.
1.7.4.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.3.
1.7.5. Con: Any public outcry over this policy is likely to subside if the policy is successful.
1.7.5.1. Con: Determining whether a policy is "successful" is often subjective and highly politically charged in and of itself.
1.7.5.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.2.1.
1.7.5.3. Con: The level of public outrage is not always determined by the practical consequences of a policy.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.2.2.
1.7.7. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.
1.7.8. Pro: As it is unlikely that all other countries would implement this policy, US citizens would perceive themselves as shouldering a burden that the rest of the world profits from. After all, medical advances spread beyond national borders.
1.7.8.1. Con: Because of the self-perception of the US as a global leader, it is more likely that American citizens would feel a sense of pride over participating in a policy that is responsible for advancing medical science in a way that has global benefits.
1.7.8.2. Con: Having the FDA as the gold standard of drug testing and approval already makes the US an extremely attractive place to develop drugs. Far from being a burden, the US actively profits from this role.
1.7.8.2.1. Pro: Having the largest economy and a particularly usurious healthcare system means that the US is a make-or-break market for many drugs. This attracts huge amounts of demand \([and thus revenue](http://blogs.plos.org/workinprogress/2012/01/25/how-much-money-do-drug-companies-pay-the-fda/)\) for the FDA.
1.7.8.2.2. Pro: Having the FDA be the most prominent and well-resourced regulator means that new drugs are often tested and launched in the USA first, to the benefit of ill Americans.
1.7.8.2.2.1. Pro: More than [half the medicines produced in the last decade](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gracemarieturner/2012/05/23/though-the-u-s-is-healthcares-world-leader-its-innovative-culture-is-threatened/#6137845c77eb) have been produced in the US.
1.7.8.2.2.2. Pro: Of the 30 major medical innovations since 1975, [US researchers made significant contributions to 27 of them; including 9 of the top 10](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa654.pdf). In comparison the entire EU contributed to just 14 of the total.
1.7.8.2.3. Con: Foreign licensing agencies often [do not accept](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/01/18/watch-new-health-picks/) FDA approval as sufficient, so having the FDA does not make the US a more attractive place to develop drugs.
1.7.9. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.6.
1.7.10. Pro: It is unlikely that people will notice any positive effects of this policy in the near future.
1.7.10.1. Pro: Even if this policy improves current and future drug trials, ineffective and unsafe drugs that are currently being sold won't be taken off the market. This means that the health risks consumers face will continue to exist if this policy carries through.
1.7.10.1.1. Con: When better and safer drugs are able to complete testing faster, they will outcompete less effective or less safe existing options.
1.7.10.1.2. Con: If it is easier to recruit more diverse drug trial participants it is more likely that trials will be conducted for existing drugs that test common "off label" uses or test their efficacy and safety for a more diverse set of patients.
1.7.10.1.3. Con: This issue, however, is not related to the topic. Ineffective and unsafe drugs will stay at the market either way.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.7.2.
1.9. Pro: The practice of randomly choosing is just and fair, as the inconvenience and potential dangers of the medical trials get distributed all over society from the bottom to the top.
1.9.1. Con: Potential dangers should not be equally distributed across all of society, as many people have more to lose than others. In particular, young people have to live with any side effects for a much longer time than the old.
1.9.1.1. Con: This is a reason to ensure that participants in human trials do not risk any long-term or permanent side-effects from the drugs. This is especially true as it is immoral to measure the worth of someone's life based on age or current life situation.
1.9.1.1.1. Con: Some amount of risk is inherent in trials - and even in the taking of approved drugs - so it is impossible to ensure that participants will not risk serious side effects.
1.9.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.3.
1.9.1.3. Con: Under voluntary participation, young people are overrepresented, so in fact random mandatory participation would alleviate this problem by reducing the number of young people vulnerable to longterm side effects.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.3.7.
1.9.3. Con: Many FDA drug trials are for cosmetic drugs \(say acne treatment\) or for quality of life drugs \(say viagra\). These do not have severe side effects or address critical health problems and so do not justify forced participation.
1.9.3.1. Con: Arguably, problems like erectile dysfunction or acne are more harmful to the wellbeing of individuals than many minor illnesses.
1.9.3.2. Con: Cosmetic and quality-of-life drugs do indeed expose people to health risks.
1.9.3.2.1. Pro: The anti-acne drug [Accutane](https://www.drugwatch.com/accutane/recall.php) caused suicidal depression and birth defects in some users and was pulled from the market.
1.9.3.2.2. Pro: Even a drug like Viagra, which is generally quite safe, can have bad side-effects. [Sildenafil](https://www.drugs.com/sfx/sildenafil-side-effects.html), which is currently in market, can cause deafness, fainting and pain in several areas of the body. Any new Viagra medicine entering testing wouldn't necessarily be any more safe.
1.9.4. Con: Many people occupy critical roles in society that forced participation in drug trials would prevent them from performing.
1.9.4.1. Con: The chances of people occupying truly critical roles being selected would be low.
1.9.4.2. Con: Drug treatments with high degrees of risk are typically for very serious illnesses, which mean the participants are unlikely to be performing a critical role in society.
1.9.4.2.1. Con: The barrier to working while on a drug trial is not necessarily the existing medical condition.
1.9.4.2.1.1. Pro: Many require invasive and inconvenient supervision and/or dosage timetables.
1.9.4.2.1.2. Pro: Many drug trials come with side-effects that can significantly impair participants' ability to work.
1.9.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: Among the [explicit purposes](http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/003006-pdf.pdf) \(p. 8\) of clinical trials is to find out the highest doses of treatments that can be given without causing unacceptable side effects. Their occurrence is thus an unavoidable part of many trials.
1.9.4.2.2. Con: There are many political leaders that suffered serious illnesses. [Some examples are](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-pneumonia-leaders-illnesses-jfk-mitterand-churchill) John F. Kennedy, who suffered from the Addison’s disease; Roosevelt, whose legs were paralyzed after a severe attack of polio; and François Mitterrand, who had prostate cancer.
1.9.4.2.3. Con: -> See 1.9.3.2.
1.9.4.3. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.3.3.1.
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.4.3.3.
1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.1.
1.9.7. Con: Distributing danger equally among non-consenting individuals is less fair than danger being unequally distributed among volunteers.
1.9.7.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.3.1.
1.9.7.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.2.3.3.2.
1.9.8. Con: Socioeconomically deprived individuals are at disproportionate risk of [disease and chronic conditions](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/10/30/americans-in-poverty-at-greater-risk-for-chronic-health-problems), so insofar as the trials select for people with the illness or condition, the burden will disproportionately fall on poorer individuals.
1.9.9. Pro: Everyone profits from improved public health. Therefore, everyone should be responsible for contributing to it.
1.9.9.1. Con: Not everybody profits from improved healthcare in the same way. Therefore, not everybody is responsible for contributing to it in the same way.
1.9.9.1.1. Con: The US healthcare system is [largely funded](http://www.pnhp.org/news/2016/january/government-funds-nearly-two-thirds-of-us-health-care-costs-american-journal-of-pub) by the government and, by extension, through taxation. Healthy people do not pay lower taxes, so we do not seem to accept the general principle that they don't have the same duties of contribution to the healthcare system.
1.9.9.1.2. Pro: Old people impose vastly higher costs on the health care system than young people \([Yamamoto, p. i](http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/files/Age-Curve-Study_0.pdf)\).
1.9.9.1.2.1. Con: Everyone who survives will eventually become elderly.
1.9.9.1.3. Con: Under the status quo, the burden disproportionately falls on the young and impoverished, who do not benefit from improved healthcare as much as the old and wealthy. Even accepting the premise that fairness requires alignment with benefit, random distribution is more fair than the status quo.
1.9.9.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.1.
1.9.9.1.4. Pro: Lifestyle is an important determinant of the degree to which an individual relies on healthcare services. Obesity, stress, smoking and drinking [significantly increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26641823) the costs that an individual causes to the system.
1.9.9.2. Con: Only those who can afford the drugs resulting from these mandatory trials can potentially benefit from them. Others will not.
1.9.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.2.3.
1.9.9.4. Con: Although everyone benefits from new technology, this does not mean we all need to become scientists or contribute to its development. We live in a world with division of labor. History has proved that it this is the most effective choice.
1.9.9.5. Pro: Many people will end up taking these drugs, but even those who never do will benefit because they will almost certainly have friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, etc. who take these drugs.
1.9.9.5.1. Con: By this logic, the majority of people benefit from the provision of almost any product in society, and therefore have a responsibility to contribute to its creation.
1.9.9.6. Con: Everybody is responsible for contributing to improved public health. They do this through taxation, healthcare insurance and healthcare bills.
1.9.9.7. Con: Everyone contributes from food production but that doesn't mean that everybody should work in that industry. Specialization allow capitalism to allocate resources more effectively.
1.9.10. Pro: -> See 1.9.4.2.1.1.
1.9.11. Con: The crux of the unfairness lies not in the method of choosing but in the element of coercion. To choose participants by lottery and compel them by force involves more coercion than using the free market to incentivise them.
1.10. Con: Since participation in many trials requires having a specific condition or meeting certain criteria, it will require a massive invasion of \(currently private\) medical records to find these people.
1.10.1. Pro: It is bad to violate privacy, regardless of whether it is a legal right.
1.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.10.1.2. Pro: If people do not believe that their medical records are kept private, they are less likely to engage with the the healthcare system.
1.10.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.10.1.3. Pro: Medical records are often incredibly personal and are some of the most important information to protect.
1.10.2. Con: This information could be collected in anonymised medical files, which could be searched for those who would be suitable and would only be decoded if a person was selected to participate in a trial. This would minimise the impact of any invasion of privacy.
1.10.2.1. Con: Many drug tests require very specific conditions, that will not be normally part of medical records of many people.
1.10.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.4.2.1.
1.10.2.3. Con: If the medical file can be "decoded" \(resolved to the original individual\) then it has not been anonymized. The very meaning of data anonymization is that said data cannot be resolved to an individual. Reference: "In the context of medical data, anonymized data refers to data from which the patient cannot be identified by the recipient of the information." [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_anonymization)
1.10.3. Pro: People have a right to privacy.
1.10.3.1. Con: Some prominent legal minds \(such as [Antonin Scalia](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/02/17/article-antonin-scalias-most-cited-law-journal-article) and [Robert Bork](http://faculty.ycp.edu/~dweiss/phl347_philosophy_of_law/bork%20right%20of%20privacy.pdf)\) argue that there is no right to privacy under the US Constitution.
1.10.3.2. Pro: The constitutions of [170 countries](https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&key=privacy) specifically enumerate the right to privacy, as does the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights \(in [Article 12](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html)\).
1.10.3.3. Pro: It could be argued that the right to privacy is a natural right because privacy is vital to [human dignity.](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/#PriHumDig)
1.10.3.4. Pro: The right to privacy is a right to not have one's personal information interfered with by others: as such, it is a [natural negative right](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/#PriConOveInf).
1.10.3.5. Con: The right to privacy is presumably contingent on people to some extent desiring that privacy, or benefiting from it. It seems strange to say that privacy is intrinsically good regardless of people's attitude towards it.
1.10.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.4.2.1.2.
1.10.4. Con: Medical records are already widely [recorded digitally and shared between different institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record) as needed.
1.10.4.1. Pro: Insurance companies and public health care systems already store people's medical data in protected and centralised systems such as [My Health Record](http://myhealthrecord.gov.au) and [Medicare](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/dhs/medicare) in Australia.
1.10.4.2. Con: Maybe in the US, but definitely not in Europe. Here, most hospitals are islands within a sea of medical info noise. Only recently have some national projects have been initiated to set up an anonymized e-health platform \(guarded from companies\).
1.10.5. Pro: This has the same problems as any large database: potential for abuse/leaks.
1.10.5.1. Pro: A leak of health information would be disastrous and might lead to serious discrimination.
1.10.5.1.1. Pro: Particularly in the workplace, employees face discrimination due to their health conditions, as e.g. [cancer patients](http://www.cancer.net/survivorship/life-after-cancer/cancer-and-workplace-discrimination). Private health information needs to be protected to prevent this discrimination.
1.10.5.2. Con: Modern cryptography and security architectures mean that a well designed system has minimal potential for leaks and abuse.
1.10.5.3. Pro: Large data leaks [occur](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/) on a regular basis. Targets have included government and/or medical agencies, including the [IRS](http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/26/pf/taxes/irs-website-data-hack/index.html), [Medicaid](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46995292/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/utah-medicaid-clients-hit-huge-data-breach/#.WI--OfkrKM8), and [Anthem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem_medical_data_breach) \(America's second-largest health insurance company\).
1.10.5.4. Con: So long as the medical information and patient identifiers are kept in separately secured systems, this would require multiple hacks, and as such, would be no more risky than any medical insurance database.
1.10.5.4.1. Con: The persistent leaks of clients' private information in large-scale hacks of companies suggest that internet security best practice is often not followed.
1.10.5.5. Con: Governments, as a whole, are pretty good at protecting crucial private information. For example, tax returns are rarely hacked en mass.
