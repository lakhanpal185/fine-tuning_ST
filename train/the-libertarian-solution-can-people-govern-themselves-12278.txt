Discussion Title: The Libertarian Solution: Can People Govern Themselves?

1. The government should be involved in the lives of its citizens as little as possible.
1.1. Con: A government too small would lead to anarchy.
1.1.1. Pro: It would fall apart because the government couldn't protect the people.
1.1.1.1. Con: The government must only be small in its power over individual liberty; the small government may still have a large military and police presence that can prevent the devolution to anarchy.
1.1.2. Con: Small government is still government, and as long as it maintains its sovereignty, it will continue to be a government. The government must have only enough power to enforce its own sovereignty.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The only issue is to prevent it from getting too big, as governments have a tendency only to [grow](https://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2015/06/16/the_us_is_defined_by_expanding_government_retreating_economy_101708.html), not to shrink.
1.1.2.2. Pro: The government only has to ensure it has the power to prevent interference with freedom and ensure individuals start with close to the same opportunities, thus ensuring freedom of choice.
1.1.3. Con: A government too small would lead to a form of anarchism that would be beneficial in the long run. By creating direct communal rule or governance, the reach of the federal or central government is very limited and the communities can take care of their own matters in their own way. An example of that is the anarchist movement in the Spanish civil war \(1936-1939\).
1.2. Pro: The intended role of the government is protection, not social intervention.
1.2.1. Pro: State and local governments were meant to create the laws of the land. Federal government was [never to supercede](http://eyler.freeservers.com/JeffPers/jefpco14.htm) state/local governments.
1.2.1.1. Con: This argument relies on the authority of past framers of American law - it is thus an example of the fallacy of appeal to authority. The fact that these men said something does not make it true or right.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Given the nation's quick rise to power during its early years, it would be logical to assert that the legislative ideologies implemented by the founding fathers were a driving factor in this growth, and that we should return to them.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Many nations have risen quickly to power in the course of history, but their legislative ideologies have been vastly different. This is evidence that legislative ideology has little impact on the rise of a nation.
1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: That a legislative ideology helps a country rise to power does not make it morally correct or politically legitimate.
1.2.1.1.1.3. Con: The legislative ideology of the founding fathers was one of many different factors, and functioned as a factor at the time of the founding of the nation. It is not clear the strength of its impact relative to other factors, nor is it clear that it could function as a driving factor to growth in the modern era.
1.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The fact that the legislative ideology didn't impede the rapid growth of the nation similarly indicates that it is a valid ideology. Growth typically happens independent of ideology, but incorrect ideology can very easily impede or even destroy past growth. See the [fall of Venezuela](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-03-02/timeline-venezuelas-slide-toward-disaster).
1.2.2. Pro: The sole purpose of a federal government is to protect the [rights of the people](http://www.edwatch.org/updates/Diversity/govtsrole.htm). The government protecting its own sovereignty is a necessary aspect of this, as the people won’t remain free if the government’s sovereignty is compromised.
1.2.2.1. Pro: A greater diversity of moderate powers \(as opposed to a few giants\) can keep each other in check, rendering government intervention less necessary.
1.2.3. Pro: A smaller government that does not interfere with its citizens’ lives has less power to cause injustices for its citizens.
1.2.3.1. Pro: The government must only be able to protect its citizens from other forms of injustice, and to have no power beyond that; this is the most just possible form of government.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Non-libertarian forms of government have historically been marred by injustice.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: [Venezuela](http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/every-time-you-buy-less-venezuela-teeters-on-the-brink/news-story/7b651bdb5481d0450786e443d789336f), the country with the largest natural oil supply on Earth, is one of the most impoverished due to failed socialist policies.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: The Venezuelan government seeks to control and plan all aspects of the country's economy and social life. This kind of concentration of power and decision making fosters corruption, abuse and inequality.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: The slave trade between Africa, America and Britain and the persistence of slavery in the United States would not have been possible without government support.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: It was only the dissolution of the government - the secession of half the nation, followed by the civil war - that finally allowed the practice of slavery in America to die.
1.2.3.2.3. Pro: Unspeakable atrocities were inflicted on people based on their religion, ethnicity, political or sexual orientation, etc. during the Third Reich in Germany.
1.2.3.3. Con: What counts as injustice is a matter of who you ask. To some libertarians, taxation is theft. To others it is a practical necessity.
1.2.3.4. Con: Government needs to be as big as the private giants that roam it if they want to defend the public.
1.2.3.5. Con: It's often not possible to protect people from injustice without the risk of causing injustice on others. Given that the government is not omniscient and the definitions of justice differ, avoiding this risk will rarely be possible.
1.2.4. Pro: "The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with the power to endanger the public liberty" John Adams. So government wasn't intended by the founding fathers to control the citizen nor the public but to control powers that threaten them. In theory it would mean government only needs enough power to perform that basic task, and the more limited societal powers are the more limited government powers could be.
1.2.4.1. Con: What the founding fathers of a single nation intended does not necessarily track the appropriate form for a government to take. This is an example of the fallacy of appeal to authority; libertarianism should be defended on its own merits, not on the basis of whether it was valued by various political thinkers.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.2.5. Con: There is no distinction here - protection IS social intervention. Protection from violence is in many ways the foundation of a society, and the forms that protection takes dictate the form of the society. For example, a society can choose to be protected from violent speech through hate speech laws, or can choose to allow this form of violence.
1.2.5.1. Con: One can argue for protection in matters such as hurt feelings and being offended, which is social intervention. Non-social forms of protection would be restricted to things like protecting against hostile foreign entities, and the acts of domestic criminals. The latter clearly has much more severe consequences if not countered.
1.2.6. Pro: The supposed role of the government is to protect its citizens, but the statement in itself is patrimonial due to its origins in the past where patriarchy dominated, but some forms of universal government protection needs to exist, particularly in regards to military and partially economy.
1.2.7. Pro: Excessive government involvement with personal matters will tend towards an authoritarian state, where eventually all personal matters are controlled by the government.
1.2.7.1. Con: A constitution and governmental systems can be designed to make it extremely difficult for any one individual or group to hold a monopoly on power and/or change the constitution to their will against the will of the people.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: Nonetheless, a constitution and any government can be designed in a very minimalistic way in order to only guarantee that no monopoly of power exists, and interference with individual freedom is kept to a minimum.
1.2.7.2. Pro: There are [many examples](https://www.historyguy.com/dictators_and_tyrants.htm) of government taking too much power throughout history, usually with the rise of a dictator.
1.2.7.2.1. Pro: Even democracy can be manipulated to grant despots more power - [Adolf Hitler was elected democratically.](https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2013/7/5/1221459/-Democratically-Elected-Despots)
1.2.7.2.1.1. Con: There are, by far, more countries that were democratic and stayed that way than countries that were democratic and became authoritarian\\totalitarian.
1.2.7.3. Pro: The desire to take power over others is a very common human trait.
1.2.7.3.1. Con: If taking power over others is part of human nature, minimizing a governments ability to have more power is irrelevant since there are other mechanisms for tyranny. Corporate oligarchy for example. A government that is run by its subjects is at least able to be changed by the people.
1.2.7.3.1.1. Con: Laws may be put in place to prevent any kind of tyranny that may infringe upon the rights of an individual within a libertarian society. Corporations are not protected under the same rights that individuals are.
1.2.7.3.1.1.1. Con: With minimalistic government there won't be enough resources to enforce these laws
1.2.7.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The amount of power a government has over its people does not determine how many resources it has. America has far more resources than Cuba, but Cuba has far more control over its people.
1.2.7.3.1.1.2. Con: Corporations with vast amounts of resources and fierce legal departments can find ways to bypass laws so quickly that legislation won't be able to keep pace
1.2.7.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Not all laws have loopholes.
1.2.7.3.1.1.3. Con: Some libertarians believe that government interference with businesses are an over-reach of government powers.
1.2.7.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: According to Libertarian author [Phillip Mirowski](https://books.google.com/books?id=kSyzcrfecuwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Road+to+Mont+Pelerin&source=bl&ots=SiJlDMWnzy&sig=flLi7pdlwqloSkVdcA2Fx8He-9o&hl=en&ei=saZ4TKStCsijnQeQj_CVCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=The%20Road%20to%20Mont%20Pelerin&f=false), monopolies are not bad for democracy, however anti-trust laws are. Proposing limits on corporate power is not a libertarian principal.
1.2.7.3.1.1.3.2. Con: The government does not have to interfere with business to protect individual liberty. There would be laws preventing businesses from taking advantage of individuals, but they may otherwise function however they like.
1.2.7.3.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Since the laws stem from and are enforced by the government, this amounts to government interference.
1.2.7.3.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Some laws are necessary, even in a libertarian society. There must be laws against murder, theft, and even corporate corruption. Laws are the only thing separating libertarianism from anarchy.
1.2.7.4. Con: Excessive government involvement w/ personal matters is the definition of an 'Authoritarian State'. That doesn't mean that any country that has some involvement in personal matters would tend to become authoritarian.
1.2.7.5. Con: It is not clear that personal matters being controlled by the government is necessarily a bad thing. Major philosophers have seen this as the basis for utopia - Plato and Sir Thomas More, for example. Government control over personal matters could lead to greater social harmony, as people would have clear guidelines to follow in their personal lives.
1.2.7.5.1. Con: Such an authoritarian utopia has never succeeded, as people not allowed basic freedoms often become restless and unite to overthrow the government. Many people do not want any guidelines in their personal lives.
1.2.7.5.1.1. Con: That people denied basic freedoms unite and overthrow their governments is historically false . Peasants, serfs, slaves, and other groups lacked even the most basic of freedoms for hundreds, if not thousands of years. While they did revolt, their revolts rarely contributed meaningfully to any instability in the government above them.
1.2.7.6. Pro: Even the US has laws preventing the government from expanding, yet it continues to find ways to [expand itself](http://www.aei.org/publication/why-does-government-grow-and-grow-and-grow/) regardless. The government must be stripped of its ability to grant itself more power.
1.3. Pro: Business thrives with minimal government intervention.
1.3.1. Con: Free market doesn't always lead to the best outcomes for the society or individuals. Regulation is necessary in the areas where profit maximization is not aligned with the best interests of society.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Negative externalities \(e.g. environmental pollution, fragility of financial system, depletion of fish stocks\) created by businesses are not priced by the market giving an advantage to the businesses that create them. This incentivizes businesses to adopt practices that harm the society at large.
1.3.1.2. Con: Businesses only exist due to their customers. In a truly free market that grants no extra protection for these corporations, consumers still wield the power to decide their fates.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: In theory, in a perfect free market where all consumers have access to all products with no impediment, be it geographical, social, technological or otherwise, this would be true. But we don't live in a perfect free market so through no fault of their own not all consumers have access to all products.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: The rise of [eCommerce](https://www.statista.com/topics/2477/online-shopping-behavior/) is rapidly turning America into a place where anyone truly does have access to any product; even in the most [desolate corners of the country.](https://tools.usps.com/go/POLocatorDetailsAction!input.action?&radius=20&locationType=po&locationTypeQ=po&locationID=1354101&utm_source=google-my-business-url&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=yext)
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Some businesses do not have consumers. For example, Algorithm Trading companies
1.3.2. Pro: Regulations are not only possible but more likely to be appropriate and successful in a state run by a decentralised government.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Private entities can regulate their sectors efficiently from a foundation of expertise and experience in their industry.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: These kind of private initiatives can take many years to form, if at all. In the meantime, consumers would suffer from social or environmental damage.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Governmental laws and regulations typically target groups of industries, rather than each one on an individual basis - this leads to regulations that can be harmful to smaller industries whose individual needs are not addressed.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Government regulations have a terrible track record of protecting consumers and often protect corporations who lobby instead.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The solution for this is better governance, not removal of controls over corporations.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: Some government regulations protect consumers \(welfare support, enforcement of law, national security etc\).
1.3.3. Con: A lack of government regulation allows monopolies to form.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Monopolies stifle innovation and progress. Without anti-monopoly regulation the incumbent monopolies lose incentives to become better.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Monopolies can be prevented without regulation. Certain economic policies can be implemented to provide advantages to smaller businesses in competing with and dethroning monopolies.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Governments routinely create monopolies, but make no effort to break them up when they prove to be either expensive or fail to provide good service.
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: Without any competition, the product or service provided by the monopoly has no reason to improve in quality or price. Quality gradually goes down, while prices go up. Monopolies ultimately hurt the consumer the most.
1.3.3.1.4. Con: Monopolies only remain incumbent when government regulation interferes with the free market, and these monopolistic companies acquire political influence to ensure they retain their power. It is only once laws are passed making competition in the monopolistic entity's field more difficult, or impossible, that the monopoly becomes entrenched.
1.3.3.1.4.1. Con: Large businesses wielding a lot of economical power can engage in anti-competitive practices even without political power.
1.3.3.1.4.1.1. Con: Their competition may also engage in pro-competitive practices if they so desire. In an open free market, there is always someone willing to compete for a larger share of the market.
1.3.3.1.4.2. Pro: Health care providers are exempt from anti trust and consumer protection laws, therefore they don't have to compete in a free market. They have a government protected monopoly.
1.3.3.1.4.3. Con: Microsoft in PC operating systems and Google in search - both monopolies that existed for many years without any laws or government support
1.3.3.1.4.3.1. Con: Microsoft has two major competitors in Mac and Linux. Furthermore, programmers can create their own operating systems from open-source OS Linux. Microsoft does not have a monopoly because nobody needs to purchase their product.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.1. Con: A monopoly can have some competitors as long as it has the lion share of the market which enables it to maintain very high profit margins and create high entry barriers
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Windows does not have the lion share of the market. If they tried to increase prices or create entry barriers, they would quickly lose business to Mac or Linux.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: [For PCs, Microsoft](http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide) is by far the largest player. You'd have to buy a MacBook computer in order to tap to MacOS which is a huge barrier. And, MacBooks are totally dominated by MacOS so the 'alternative' is another monopoly.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A company having 100% of the market for a product designed only for their own product does not constitute a monopoly. The higher product, in this case computers, is the only one where a monopoly would have a genuine economic impact, and the computer market is far from a monopoly.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.1.1.2. Con: The average person doesn't know how to install a new OS and any PC comes with Windows pre-installed. Major barrier. On the other hand, practically no PC comes with Linux pre-installed
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Anyone can learn how to install a new OS through a [short tutorial](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-install-linux/). Given the ease with which a free OS like Linux may be installed, it is not a barrier whatsoever.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.1.1.3. Con: [Microsoft's dominance of the PC market](http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide) created the situation in which all hardware developers created drivers for Windows but only some created drivers for Linux. Other OS creators would have to create drivers for all these hardware devices which is an enormous competitive barrier
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Since Linux is open-source, anyone can create drivers for it. There are [online databases](https://www.linux-drivers.org/) full of Linux drivers for just about anything you can imagine.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.1.2. Con: Linux is completely free. This prevents Microsoft from raising prices on Windows.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.2. Con: It's not practical to run MacOS on a PC. You can only use a virtual machine to run MacOS which features very low performance.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: You don't need to buy a PC.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3. Con: A business that uses PCs would have to replace all their computers with MacBooks in order to use MacOS which is a huge time and cost barrier.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1. Con: Businesses frequently have to buy new computers as technology advances anyways. This is just a good reason for some businesses to choose Macs as their new computers instead of Windows computers, as Macs can run any OS.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: This is also a good reason for new businesses to buy Macs in the first place, which is an economic advantage for Apple. This proves that Microsoft does not have monopolistic control of the OS market.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.1.1. Con: This isn't a good reason to get a Mac since it puts you in the same position where you're trapped and can't switch for a reasonable effort\\price
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: You don't need to switch if you get a Mac; they can run any OS.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.1.2. Con: Apple has economically 0% of the OS market since MacOS is available for free. Microsoft charges for Windows, used by most OS users and has 100% of the revenue in the OS market despite the fact the alternatives are free.. This proves that Microsoft has a monopoly in the OS market
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: A competitor offering their product for free does not mean the one company that charges for that product has a monopoly. The fact that their competitors' products are free actually puts pressure on Microsoft to ensure the quality and affordability of their product, as it would be very easy to lose business to the free products if they fail their consumers in either of these regards. The danger of a monopoly is its ability to overprice low quality products - Microsoft simply can't do that.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: Most consumers get Windows for free when they purchase a PC. You don't have to specifically buy Windows to get Windows.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.2. Con: The switching cost for an OS is extremely high if you need to get a different computer for that. It's like you need to get a different home if you are not pleased with your current TV
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.2.1. Con: If you buy the computer that can run any OS, it from that point costs only as much as the OS. It's about making the smarter initial decision based on your needs.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.3. Con: If you buy a few new computers with a different OS it causes a lot of compatibility issues.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.3.1. Con: You can install the same old OS you were using before on a Mac. That is one of the advantages of using a Mac.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.4. Con: Businesses rarely replace all their computers at once since the economic and cultural costs are huge.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.3.1.4.1. Con: They replace them all eventually. Whether it's all at once or individually is not an issue.
1.3.3.1.4.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.4.3.1.1.1.3.
1.3.3.1.4.3.2. Con: Google has always had multiple competitors, such as Yahoo.
1.3.3.1.4.3.2.1. Con: Google has more than 90% of the market... That is monopoly by definition [gs.statcounter.com](http://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share)
1.3.3.1.4.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.4.3.1.1.
1.3.3.1.4.3.2.3. Con: Yahoo struggles for its survival while Google thrives.
1.3.3.1.4.3.2.3.1. Con: If not Yahoo, try one of Google's [140+ other competitors](http://140+ other competitors). Many of them are far from struggling.
1.3.3.1.4.4. Pro: In a libertarian society, individual liberty must always be favored over group interests. Political influence, therefore, must belong exclusively to the individual.
1.3.3.1.4.5. Con: Businesses have inherent political influence over their workers. Threats of layoffs are common if a legal measure is presented which negatively affects a company.
1.3.3.1.4.5.1. Con: Employees can't be selectively laid off if they don't vote according to their company. Usually the only reason employees of a company would vote how the company wants on certain issues is because the well-being of the company is in the employee's self-interest. If the company loses net profit, everyone suffers.
1.3.3.1.4.5.1.1. Con: The economic interests of the company are still an inherent political influence that a company has over their employees.
1.3.3.1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: Only in the sense that they share a common self-interest. By this same analogy, most citizens of a country share certain political beliefs due to it being in the best interest of those who live in the country. The same can be said of any group of people who may be affected in one way or another by legislation. Businesses are not unique in this way.
1.3.4. Pro: Businesses thrive in markets where demand and supply are allowed to reach the optimal equilibrium, without external taxes and limitations.
1.4. Con: Less government regulation of business can lead to negative environmental and social repercussions.
1.4.1. Pro: A government that does not intervene with social issues necessarily leads to social inequality.
1.4.1.1. Pro: When inequality is unaddressed it has the potential to create permanent underclasses, such as slavery and caste systems.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Underclasses prevent the best people from being able to rise to the top because of circumstances outside their control, and allows people who are not the best to remain at the top.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Laws can easily be set in place that prohibit [slavery](https://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/13th-amendment) and harmful caste systems without interfering with individual liberty in a libertarian society.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: There are informal versions of social hierarchies which would go unaddressed.
1.4.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: People who are born rich would be more likely to stay rich regardless of their ability. Likewise, poor people would be likely to stay poor regardless of their ability.
1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: In a true capitalist system, sufficiently talented, intelligent, entrepreneurial or hard-working individuals may rise through the financial ranks by their own merit.
1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Individuals which are more powerful, wealthy, talented, or otherwise gifted would have an advantage over others, and could plausibly create a feudal aristocracy in short order.
1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This happens in every society ever sustained, from the ruling classes in Soviet Russia and Maoist China to the Silicon Valley elites of America. Inequality on a large scale is impossible to abolish, which renders this useless as an argument against libertarianism.
1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: A certain level of inequality of outcome is actually a good thing, as it promotes ambition and rewards merit. This allows the most talented or intelligent individuals to rise to the top of the social hierarchy, where they can be of most use to the rest of their society. Those at the top generally deserve to be there.
1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Productive and talented members of society shouldn’t be forced to be on the same level, socially or financially, as lazy and unintelligent people. Some level of inequality is a necessity for a functioning society.
1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.4. Con: The only way to possibly avoid this is through totalitarianism, theft, violence, and indoctrination. Every society that has ever strived for economic equity has collapsed and led to the [deaths of millions.](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/stalin-died-60-years-too-late)
1.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the US, there are nearly [28 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonnazar/2013/09/09/16-surprising-statistics-about-small-businesses/#69f399f55ec8) small businesses. This is an example of people succeeding in America's capitalist system.
1.4.1.1.3. Pro: The so-called '[Great Gatsby curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Gatsby_curve)' suggests that social mobility is lower in countries with larger income inequality.
1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: The correlation observed in the "Great Gatsby curve" could [well be an artifact](http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2013/07/some-observations-on-great-gatsby-curve.html). Lower dispersion of incomes makes a higher intergenerational income mobility inherently more likely.
1.4.1.1.4. Con: Less government intervention means a lower possibility of laws and regulations that contribute to solidifying permanent underclasses.
1.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: Racial segregation in the US or Apartheid in South Africa was supported by law and enforced by government.
1.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: Immigration laws prevent people who aren't citizens of a country from fully participating in the labor market or starting their own businesses.
1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.4.1.3. Con: A libertarian government naturally promotes less division between races. The individual is the only one [truly capable of defeating racism](https://fee.org/articles/libertarianism-anti-racism/). No law or government program can ever achieve that. To do that, the people must be given the freedom to make their own choices.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: Government do influence culture which can influence people's behavior \(e.g. fines and imprisonment deter people from certain behaviors\)
1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: Reverse psychology also suggests people are more likely to have a desire to do things they are told not to do, even in spite of consequences.
1.4.1.4. Pro: If the government does not intervene, it is those that are worse off and in need of welfare support that perish.
1.4.1.4.1. Con: The free market and charitable organizations support those who need help much better than a government welfare program can. Welfare breeds complacency, which keeps people impoverished.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: ["...the decrease in poverty between 1900 and 1967 occurred before the advent of the greatly expanded welfare state. In other words, it was the free market, not government welfare, that caused the poverty rate to fall from 56 percent in 1900 to 13 percent in 1967"](https://fee.org/articles/the-free-market-lifting-all-boats/)
1.4.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Correlation doesn't mean causation. In other countries \(some with welfare some without\) poverty also dropped during this time.
1.4.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Japan](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Welfare_in_Japan) has enacted multiple welfare programs starting 1920s and [extreme poverty plummeted](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty) in those years
1.4.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Extreme poverty dropped globally due largely to the [advancement of technology](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/a-23-2008-07-01-voa1-83136752/128566.html). This happens in spite of welfare, not because of it.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Con: Government assures that all who's in need would be supported. There are no mechanisms in a free market that can assure that charitable organizations would provide enough support to ALL individuals in need. Some would be left to suffer or die
1.4.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: The finite and uncertain nature of charitable support doesn't allow people to plan long term and therefore inhibits their ability to pull themselves out of poverty
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Government programs often end up supporting people who are not in need, or breeding complacency among those who begin receiving support. The finite and uncertain nature of charitable support necessarily prevents complacency and system abuse, yet it would be enough to allow people to return to being able to support themselves.
1.4.1.4.2. Con: Only [30% of welfare recipients](https://www.upi.com/Census-30-percent-on-welfare-disabled/17991361916506/) are disabled, meaning, at the very least, 70% are able to work. Those who are able but not willing to work hard enough to support themselves don't deserve the money of taxpayers.
1.4.1.4.2.1. Pro: Most people with disabilities can still work if their needs are accommodated.
1.4.1.4.2.2. Pro: Many people who receive government support for disability have very mild, non-debilitating issues that do not preclude their ability to work in most situations.
1.4.1.4.3. Con: The way out of poverty is not through being given free money, but through hard work.
1.4.1.5. Con: Unequal outcomes are an important signal how resources and labour in a society should be allocated. If we had perfect \(or even forced\) equality, the individuals' incentive to innovate to improve their living conditions would be undermined and society would stagnate.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Struggles and challenges are an essential aspect of the human condition.
1.4.1.5.1.1. Pro: Those who seek to abolish all the difficulties and inequalities in life fail to understand how it is precisely those things that drive innovation and discovery. Without these things, society would become inherently complacent and stagnant.
1.4.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Necessity is the mother of invention.
1.4.1.5.1.2. Pro: It's the desire to work to create one's own prosperity that reduces excess inequality, not the desire to take from those who have successfully created their own prosperity.
1.4.1.6. Con: Equality is not justice.
1.4.1.6.1. Pro: A just system allows people to reap the full rewards of their effort, skill, and intelligence. Some people are naturally more skilled, harder working, or more intelligent than others. Those who provide the greatest benefit to society should be allowed to rise to the top. It’s not equal, but it is just.
1.4.1.6.1.1. Con: Not all people who rise to the top are more skilled, harder working, or more intelligent. Some people reach the top by birth, criminal activity, or exploitation.
1.4.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Crime, birthright, and exploitation will exist regardless of what economic system is in place. This is not the fault of a just economic system that does allow the hard-working to also reach the top.
1.4.1.6.1.2. Con: People that rise to the top can stay there due to their power even if they stop being harder working and stop acting intelligently
1.4.1.6.1.2.1. Con: History has shown this time and time again: the [foolish and lazy](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-worst-ceos-in-american-history-2010-5) always eventually fall from power.
1.4.1.6.1.2.2. Con: Those that rise to the top do not prevent others from doing so by staying there.
1.4.1.6.1.2.2.1. Con: Those at the top have more power than people at the bottom. They can use their power to stay at the top and prevent from others rising. This happens in any form of organization be it a government, corporation or even mega-corps vs. small businesses
1.4.1.6.1.2.2.1.1. Con: In a governmental system that enforces the rule of law, and provides no protections or benefits to those at the top, they have no extra power.
1.4.1.6.1.3. Pro: The wealthiest people tend to create the most jobs, which is what allows people to rise from poverty in the first place.
1.4.2. Pro: Businesses do not necessarily have either the resources or inclination to accurately assess their individual impact on society and nature. Government is needed to manage an industry's impacts as a whole.
1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.4.2.2. Con: Business always inclines towards what people want. The government is needed only in situations when the majority is not willing to spend their resources on certain important issues that only a minority are aware of. But this is not the case of democracy, because in democracy the majority rules.
1.4.3. Pro: Free businesses might exploit human weaknesses and [biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) to get their money in unethical ways.
1.4.3.1. Con: To be able to implement the regulations, you would have to designate bias experts. These people will accumulate power, and that is dangerous. But most importantly: there is no good way to select those people and give them power, because the same mechanism for weakness exploitation can be used by politicians.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Such mechanisms are actually used by politicians more frequently. In a free market you lose money when you make bad decisions, but elections provide far less feedback \(plus the feedback is much more complicated than income balance\). People continue making the same mistakes again and again until they completely destroy the country \(e.g. USSR, Venezuela\).
1.4.4. Pro: Free market tends to be socially beneficial only in mature industries with high competition.
1.4.4.1. Pro: In an emerging industry with little competition monopolies tend to form [www.wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536), leading to high prices and lower potential quality
1.4.4.2. Con: The majority of industries are mature, and all successful industries eventually mature with time. It is most logical to favor mature industries as a whole, economic principle.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Industry maturation can take many years and even decades. In the meantime, some people can suffer from irreparable health issues, lose of personal possesions or poor product\\service quality.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: If a bank defaults, I would lose all my money and maybe my house if I can't keep paying my mortgage.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1. Con: You can lose all your money for any number of reasons. This is why people invest in a variety of sources.
1.4.4.2.1.2. Pro: If a drug company produces a drug with severe health consequences, the damage to me may be irreparable.
1.4.4.2.1.2.1. Con: This can happen in any situation, especially in instances when animal testing produces different results than human drug trials. A free market only ensures that companies that continually do this will go out of business.
1.4.4.2.1.2.2. Pro: Until a company with bad practices goes out of business many people can suffer. A well functioning government can set a high bar for drug development that would prevent any citizen from suffering due to bad practices of a drug company.
1.4.4.2.1.2.3. Pro: A government can also compensate and help people that suffered in case its control mechanisms missed some bad practices. On the contrary, a company that goes out of business won't compensate anyone
1.4.4.2.1.2.4. Con: Taking experimental drugs is completely voluntary. You must assume the risk if you wish to do that.
1.4.4.2.1.2.4.1. Con: A drug doesn't have to be experimental in order to cause damage. Corporations have an incentive to hide or minimize the perceived significance of these risks.
1.4.4.2.1.2.4.1.1. Con: Intentionally or knowingly causing harm to people with a product would be illegal in any governmental system besides absolute anarchy. That's not a matter of regulation of the free market - that's just a crime.
1.4.4.2.1.3. Con: The long-term benefits of a free market greatly outweigh the short-term consequences in those few markets that have not yet matured.
1.4.4.2.2. Con: Innovation makes any industry lose maturity by disrupting the status quo. Rate of innovation grows exponentially so disruption would be even more prevalent in the future.
1.4.5. Con: Government regulation often has unintended side-effects, and government tends to leave laws in place whether they are achieving the desired ends or not.
1.4.6. Con: People can hold businesses accountable and refuse to do business with those whose ethics are questionable.
1.4.6.1. Con: Although the market does give people the power to hold businesses accountable, this takes action and sometimes sacrifice on the part of consumers. The public has not demonstrated a willingness to reliably take the actions and make the sacrifices needed to hold businesses accountable.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: It's usually as simple as not buying from a company you disagree with. Businesses have a long track record of changing their business practices when it affects their bottom line.
1.4.6.1.2. Con: The public continuously holds businesses accountable. Businesses thrive because they are voluntarily patronized by customers. They fail because customers withdraw their patronage.
1.4.6.2. Pro: It has never been easier for people to share opinions of businesses with others.
1.4.7. Pro: Policies such as the clean air act have reduced pollution.
1.4.7.1. Con: French economist Fréderic Bastiat showed more than 150 years ago that there are "Seen and Unseen" effects in policies. The seen effect here is the cleaner air. The unseen effects are some costs. To refer to clean air without mentioning the costs is meaningless for everyone, for whom the clean air is not the only important thing in this world.
1.4.8. Con: Environmental and social wellbeing are ultimately in the best interests of businesses. Given enough freedom, businesses don't need to compromise society or the environment to thrive. Preserving these things will help them in the long run.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Nobody starts a business intending it to fail. They all must utilize sustainable business models. Any damage caused would be avoided through the government allowing companies what they need, while encouraging socially beneficial business practices, and enforcing individual liberty in the case a business attempts to infringe upon it. That’s as opposed to simply punishing those who step outside some arbitrary boundary with taxes and regulations, which kill otherwise perfectly good businesses.
1.4.8.1.1. Con: Many founders plan to sell their business, especially start-ups. Therefore, for these businesses long-term sustainable considerations are very low priority
1.4.8.1.1.1. Con: Proving that the business has the ability to be sustained long-term is a major selling point. Potential buyers don't want to buy a business that will inevitably collapse.
1.4.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Investors want enough ROI, long-term success is a secondary consideration. If they can make money from selling their shares to make short term gain they would do it. Prior to the dot com bubble investors invested and sold they shares once their price soared, making nice profits, even though they knew that it is a bubble that would eventually burst. The same for investment bankers that rolled off the toxic assets prior to sub prime crisis.
1.4.8.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Investing in a publicly traded company is not the same as buying out the company - whoever is in charge of it when it collapses is the one who loses money, and it is in their best interest to keep that from happening.
1.4.8.2. Con: Regulation needs to be applied globally otherwise business will just move overseas where they are free to run sweatshops and pollute the environment
1.4.8.2.1. Con: This would only be possible with a single global government, which is nigh impossible due to the stark differences in the world's cultures.
1.4.8.2.1.1. Pro: Global government opens the door to global tyranny.
1.4.8.2.1.2. Con: There can be an international agreement among nations.
1.4.8.2.1.2.1. Con: Considering all the nations currently [at war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts) with one another, finding a common ground between every single country on Earth would require a global reform on a scale never seen, and seldom even thought possible.
1.4.8.2.2. Con: Countries like China and India who benefit greatly from this practice will put up a huge fight to keep it in place, especially with how much money is involved. Unless you want to go to war, this practice will continue.
1.4.8.3. Con: Shareholders and executives often prioritize short-term gains over very long term risks especially with emerging businesses where investors can sell their portion of the company after a few years
1.4.8.4. Con: In a free market, the health care industry would maximize their profits by providing treatments for the symptoms of chronic diseases, [rather than providing cures](http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/goldman-sachs-says-curing-diseases-may-not-be-economically-valid/page-2/).
1.4.8.4.1. Con: Science and healthcare are two independent things - if a scientist manages to make healthcare obsolete with a discovery, the healthcare industry cannot do anything to stop him or her.
1.4.8.4.1.1. Con: A big pharma company can buy the patent for the ultimate cure and then do nothing with it.
1.4.8.4.1.1.1. Con: This is only if a government enforces patents on cures. This is the sort of thing a small enough government would never do.
1.4.8.4.2. Con: Health insurance agencies will push for cures and better and cheaper treatments to be developed if it will reduce their costs.
1.4.8.4.3. Con: If that were true, the healthcare industry in America wouldn’t sell vaccines, as cures are much more profitable.
1.4.8.5. Pro: Any business in a truly free market depends on its customers. If a business betrays society's best interest, the consumers will turn to the competition instead. Businesses must treat the public right in order to survive.
1.4.8.5.1. Con: A business's consumers [are not necessarily impacted by the environmental hazards they produce](http://www.cleveland19.com/story/36469073/maryland-suing-epa-on-power-plant-pollution-in-ohio-other-states).
1.4.8.5.1.1. Con: The consumers don’t have to be physically impacted to be morally impacted.
1.4.8.5.2. Con: This is not the case with monopolies or a duopoly which has reached agreements.
1.4.8.5.2.1. Con: A truly free market will not allow a monopoly to exist. Monopolies are roadblocks in true capitalism.
1.4.8.5.2.1.1. Con: Monopolies are resisted by anti-monopoly legislation, which is a form of government regulation.
1.4.8.5.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.
1.4.8.6. Con: Most environmental regulations were initially introduced because of pollution from businesses.
1.4.8.6.1. Con: As sustainable technology advances, more and more businesses will adopt sustainable methods; not because they are legally required to, but because it ensures they will never run out of the resources essential to their business. Eventually, sustainability will be more cost-effective than unsustainable methods.
1.4.8.6.1.1. Con: Human nature is often to maximise profit/production/success in the short them, without looking at long term external, possibly unintended impacts.
1.4.8.6.1.1.1. Con: Human nature often doesn’t yield the best results. Businesses that intend to survive long-term must ignore this instinct.
1.4.8.6.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.3.
1.4.8.6.1.2. Pro: Businesses that have no consideration for long terms effects eventually fail. It is in the best interest of any sustainable business model to consider such things.
1.4.8.6.1.2.1. Con: An unsustainable business may eventually fail, but in the mean time it does short term damage. Therefore government is required to regulate businesses to prevent such damage.
1.4.8.6.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.8.1.
1.4.8.6.1.3. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.4.8.6.1.4. Con: Energy production is not the only source of pollution. Waste management, air quality, and many other factors contribute to pollution.
1.4.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.6.1.
1.4.9. Con: "Government regulation" is a euphemism for violence imposed on those who do not follow the rules.
1.5. Con: Without significant federal taxes, our infrastructure would cease to exist.
1.5.1. Con: Local governments in the US have used [other, voluntary means](https://lancasteronline.com/opinion/city-used-lottery-not-taxes-to-raise-revenue-in/article_7f83eff5-7e7a-5edf-bed0-bb2580690b76.html) of acquiring money to pay for infrastructure prior to the institution of income taxes.
1.5.2. Con: Infrastructure existed in the US prior to the institution of the federal income tax in 1913.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Income was largely generated through tariffs, but the American citizens still lived with no tax on their income whatsoever, barring a brief income tax during and shortly after the Civil War.
1.5.2.2. Con: The [Works Progress Administration](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a24692/fdr-new-deal-wpa-infrastructure/) in FDR's New Deal built 650,000 miles of road, 78,000 bridges, 125,000 civilian and military buildings, and 800 airports, modernizing America's infrastructure.
1.5.3. Con: Private enterprise has time and time again proven to be far more efficient at building and repairing infrastructure than the government.
1.5.3.1. Pro: The government of New York City spent six years and $12 million trying to repair the Wollman Memorial Ice Rink. In 1986, Donald Trump took over the project, and famously completed it [under budget, and ahead of schedule](https://nypost.com/2017/01/22/saving-wollman-rink-made-trump-a-new-york-city-hero/), as he proudly states he does with [all his construction projects.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-hotel-in-washington-d-c-to-open-ahead-of-schedule-1454901018)
1.5.3.2. Pro: Corporations will build and maintain infrastructure they depend on for business, such as [public roads](https://www.wkbw.com/news/dominos-pizza-is-on-a-mission-to-fix-potholes), when government fails to keep up.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: They do not tend to have the same motivation in the same way that infrastructure delivered via the government needs to consider many more use cases given they are operating on behalf of all of the countries citizens.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Con: It’s better than the government, having little to no motivation at all, as evidenced by the lack of maintenance performed on many of the country's public roads.
1.5.3.3. Con: Infrastructure can be built more efficiently by public or private means [depending](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/public-private-mix-best-finance-infrastructure/41251/) on a variety of factors. One is not inherently superior to the other.
1.5.4. Pro: Privately held infrastructure can be easily used to create a local monopoly.
1.5.4.1. Con: This only happens when there are laws in place preventing competitors from building infrastructure serving the same area, as is often the case with, for example, electrical utility providers. Take away the laws and governmental protections, and the monopoly won't survive.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: In the example of electrical utility - for a new and remote town, a company can find it profitable to invest in installing electrical infrastructure with the assumption they would be a monopoly \(very high profit margins.\)
When a potential competitor considers to compete, they  might be discouraged because competition would lead to low profit margins that won't justify the infrastructure investment.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Con: A resident of the town who is being negatively affected by the monopoly's price is likely to invest in the infrastructure himself, as evidenced by the prevalence of local internet service providers in areas that don't have laws protecting large companies from competition. If there are no laws protecting a monopoly, someone will always try to get a piece of their market.
1.5.4.1.1.1.1. Con: For the mentioned resident, it still won't make economic sense to invest in the electrical infrastructure due to very high setup cost. It just wouldn't be profitable.
1.5.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If the resident is the owner of a business that requires large amounts of electricity, it could actually be more profitable in the long run, especially in the face of electricity costs constantly rising.
1.5.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: That's a big if... If there is a big enough business that can spare vast amounts of resources to invest in such endeavor, if they have the right skill set to do it
1.5.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The monopoly can decide to keep the price at a level where this won't be economically viable for the local business to build the infrastructure and yet high enough to have large profit margins
1.5.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: That means it would have to be kept fairly low, as alternative power sources rapidly become cheaper to install. Hence the point of competition in the free market - the supposed monopoly can't raise prices exorbitantly for fear of losing business to other options.
1.5.4.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: The electricity bill would have to be enormous in order for this to be profitable because once there's competition profit margins would be low
1.5.4.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The rise of cheaper alternative power sources like solar would make it more viable.
1.5.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Local internet providers use existing infrastructure, therefore setup cost is low. This claim isn't applicable to high cost infrastructures such as road, water and electric.
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Alternative electric infrastructures such as solar power are rapidly becoming cheaper and more efficient. Middle class individuals are now able to afford solar power setups in areas that don't place extra financial burdens or outright bans on alternative or 'off the grid' power sources.
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Many rural areas have little to no road infrastructure, and they function just fine without it. Paved and maintained roads on any large scale are only necessary in more densely populated urban and suburban areas, where there is going to be competition for road construction.
1.5.4.1.1.1.2.3. Con: If the government hadn't banned the collecting of rain water, people in most rural areas would have no need for water infrastructure.
1.5.4.1.1.2. Con: When a competitor runs out of other major markets to invest in, they will likely target smaller or more remote towns even if the profit margins are low.
1.5.5. Pro: Without taxes, public goods like roads would not be properly developed or maintained.
1.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.5.3.2.
1.6. Con: Some critical aspects of societal advancement may not be economically viable when revenue is prioritized.
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.4.
1.6.2. Con: Some critical aspects of societal advancement may not be supported by government, in whose best interests it is to keep its people dependent.
1.6.2.1. Con: Many governments provide healthcare for the citizens. Abolishing diseases, for example, is a net benefit to the government since it lowers expenses and increases productivity, which in turn boosts the economy.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Many governments would prefer to keep their citizens dependent through things like healthcare and medication. These governments want power, not money.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Con: This suggests that those government officials and clerks in charge are conspiring against their citizens. Highly unlikely since so many people would have to be involved in the conspiracy
1.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: "[Corruption is a serious problem](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10611-017-9732-0) in nearly every state in the world." Young democracies in developing countries are particularly at risk of this.
1.6.2.1.1.2. Con: That would mean a government would disapprove a drug that can save people's lives. Sounds highly unlikely. When the public finds out they would be voted out
1.6.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Cannabis was [federally banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Drug_Abuse_Prevention_and_Control_Act_of_1970) for all medicinal use in 1970, which is still the case to this day.
1.6.2.1.2. Con: Productivity is not the target. Government is made by the people with their own interests. They are usually sponsored by big investor who is expecting something in return. This explains why there exists industrial incentives 60 years after it was proved they are always decreasing overall productivity. [Economics in one lesson \(pdf, 198 pages\).](https://admin.fee.org/files/doclib/20121116_economicsinonelesson.pdf)
1.6.2.2. Pro: Living off the grid is [illegal in Canada and most US counties](https://www.theinertia.com/environment/apparently-its-illegal-to-live-off-the-grid-2/) as a means of keeping the citizens dependent upon the government.
1.6.3. Pro: Private prisons have an incentive to keep people inside to increase profits. Therefore, rehabilitation of prisoners is not economical
1.6.3.1. Con: That only depends if anyone's paying them to house prisoners. Running a prison is very expensive, and without any source of income generated by it, it would cease to exist in a free market if not held afloat by the government.
1.6.3.2. Con: Fewer laws and regulations will reduce the need for prison space.
1.6.3.3. Con: It's not clear that a society built on libertarian principles will have prisons. A more effective penalty for violators of the established rules could be compensating victims for the damage caused by the violation.
1.6.3.4. Con: [Victimless crimes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victimless_crime) are unlikely to be prosecuted in a society built on libertarian principles.
1.6.4. Con: Libertarianism does not prioritize revenue, but rather stresses the importance of freedom of the individual and voluntary self-organization.
1.6.4.1. Pro: In a libertarian society, people can and will still engage in charity or activities that aren't revenue-maximizing.
1.7. Pro: In the few instances in which libertarianism has been dutifully tried it has led to unprecedented economic prosperity and peace for generations.
1.7.1. Pro: [Neutral Moresnet](https://mises.org/library/anarchy-aachen) is the most successful example of anarcho-capitalism in world history.
1.7.1.1. Con: Moresnet was overseen by several nations. It was specifically in a demilitarized zone, that was conceded by other states.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Despite that, it was very isolated and had almost no interaction with any of the involved nations. The citizens, in that case, were free to govern themselves.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Their status as a DMZ meant that they could spend relatively little on their military and protective policies. This affects their economy as a whole.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Being a very small isolated area, they wouldn't have had to anyways. Many small isolated nations, [like those on islands and between other countries' borders](https://www.storypick.com/country-no-army/), don't have any military whatsoever.
1.7.1.2. Con: Moresnet's existence was due to two nations feuding over who would have the property rights to a mineral rich area. The fact that they were economically prosperous was most likely due to their mineral wealth rather than libertarian philosophy.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: A wealth of resources does not necessarily mean that a country will be wealthy. Without libertarian philosophies, even the most resource-wealthy areas can become impoverished. Certain libertarian policies are essential to maintaining any healthy economy.
1.7.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.
1.7.2. Pro: The [United States of America](http://independentpoliticalreport.com/2017/04/was-america-ever-libertarian/) functioned mostly under libertarian principles for most of its existence, until relatively recently. These are the principles that allowed one of the world's youngest countries to quickly rise to the center of the world stage.
1.7.2.1. Con: America was considered libertarian from its founding until the 1860s. This was also the time that slavery occurred.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: True libertarianism demands freedom for all individuals. America, during that time, was functioning as a libertarian society in an economic sense, but not yet fully in a social sense.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: Then America was not libertarian during most of its existence.
1.7.2.1.1.1.1. Con: It may not have been, but it had displayed how many of these libertarian philosophies can be successful. America’s economy would have most likely been even stronger today had they fully adopted all the philosophies of libertarianism.
1.7.2.1.2. Con: There is no causal link between slavery and libertarianism. The policies of libertarianism function better without slavery.
1.7.2.1.2.1. Con: Expenditures by a country tend to be lower when there is free labor.
1.7.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Slaves also make no contribution to the economy, or pay taxes, yet there would be many costs associated with maintaining them. Hiring free citizens as employees far is more beneficial for the economy as a whole.
1.7.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Businesses may not be concerned with the economy as a whole.
1.7.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Every business is affected by the economy it operates in.
1.7.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Some businesses exploit the system for the greatest benefit to their bottom line. [Amazon pays zero dollars in federal taxes.](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/amazon-earned-5-6b-in-2017-but-paid-no-federal-taxes)
1.7.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Amazon, being an online retailer and huge employer still pays other taxes, like sales tax, and they provide a huge contribution to the economy.
1.7.2.1.2.2. Pro: The concept of slavery is incompatible with true libertarianism, which favors individual liberty above all else.
1.7.2.2. Con: America was very libertarian in the 1920s. This helped lead to the Great Depression.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: The Great Depression would have only been a regular depression had it not been for the extremely [anti-libertarian policies](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/FDR-s-Policies-Prolonged-Depression-5409) implemented by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
1.7.2.2.1.1. Con: Part of Roosevelt's New Deal policy was non-enforcement of antitrust laws, which is libertarian in principle.
1.7.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Non-enforcement of antitrust laws are only libertarian insofar as they are to be replaced by economic policy that favors businesses that are fair to their consumers. One without the other is merely a failure to implement libertarianism.
1.7.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: This is not a libertarian philosophy. Most right-libertarian philosophies tend towards complete government non-interference.
1.7.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Economic policy is not interference. In fact, libertarianism is an economic policy.
1.7.2.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: That’s not necessarily true. Libertarians believe some government involvement is necessary. The government must only [“protect property rights, adjudicate disputes, and provide a legal framework in which voluntary trade is protected.”](https://www.lp.org/issues/the-economy/)
1.7.2.2.1.2. Pro: [Unemployment remained very high](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/421169?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) due to NIRA encouraging collusion and anti-competition policies between businesses, granting unions more bargaining power, and mandatory wage increases.
1.7.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: The eventual abandonment of these anti-competitive policies coincides with the strong economic recovery seen in the 1940's.
1.7.2.2.1.3. Pro: FDR's attempted stimulus plan [ultimately failed](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011116/economic-effects-new-deal.asp) because they tried reducing income inequality as a means of recovering the economy. The New Deal significantly increased taxes, artificially raised prices on goods, and discouraged small business.
1.7.2.2.1.3.1. Con: The New Deal resulted in significant income growth for the Middle Class through the end of the war up until the Reagan Tax Cuts.
1.7.2.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Yes, it had some success in reducing income inequality, but it was at the cost of prolonging the Great Depression and further damaging the economy. FDR’s policies are still to blame for the prolongment of the depression.
1.7.2.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: The intention of The New Deal was not to grow the economy, but to grow the wealth of the average American, and from a Macro perspective, this did happen. [The median income in The United States increased 900% in 38 years from 1947 to 1985.](https://www.census.gov/prod/99pubs/99statab/sec31.pdf)
1.7.2.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con: FDR believed reducing the wage gap would result in a stronger economy. The wage gap was successfully, albeit artificially, reduced, but the economy suffered as a result. It solved a problem that wasn’t the real problem to begin with.
1.7.2.2.1.4. Con: Roosevelt wasn't President until 1933. The depression was three years old at that point.
1.7.2.2.1.4.1. Con: It was his [policies](https://www.facebook.com/prageru/videos/1773960495980132/) that helped drag it on for seven more years. It could have been a regular economic depression otherwise.
1.7.2.2.1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.2.2.1.1.
1.7.2.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.2.1.2.
1.7.2.2.1.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.2.1.3.
1.7.2.2.2. Con: The 1920’s were also some of the most [economically prosperous](https://www.history.com/topics/roaring-twenties) years in America’s History. It wasn’t until libertarian policies were being abandoned that the economy entered the heart of the Great Depression.
1.7.2.2.2.1. Con: Both the economic prosperity and the stock market crash were due to deregulation as part of libertarian policies.
1.7.2.2.2.1.1. Con: Recessions and depressions are a natural part of a working economy. Deregulation would have also allowed for much quicker recovery from these events.
1.7.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Regulations allow for greater stability. Under a libertarian economic system the highs are higher and the lows are lower.
1.7.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Despite this, the net gain is much higher. An overly regulated economy may be more stable, but it averages at a lower point that a free market does.
1.7.2.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Though the highs are great for a small part of the population, a greater percentage of the population is affected by the lows.
1.7.2.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Highs and lows affect the entire population in a free market system. The highs mean more revenue for businesses, and more jobs, higher wages, and lower costs of living for lower classes. Even the upper class doesn't escape the effects of a depressed economy.
1.7.3. Pro: [Switzerland’s economy](https://www.quora.com/What-countries-come-closest-to-being-ideal-libertarian-societies/answer/Abhimanyu-Pallavi-Sudhir) comes very close to economic libertarianism in certain areas. Different parts of Switzerland are governed differently, as states in the US are, but the most economically libertarian of these states are generally the most prosperous.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Switzerland has [no minimum wage](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080515/5-developed-countries-without-minimum-wages.asp), yet they have some of the [highest average wages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage) in the world, as well as some of the [lowest rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate) of unemployment.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Switzerland has a very small federal government with no single head of state.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Healthcare is owned entirely by private business. The free market increases quality while lowering costs. Even though it is mandatory, the government does not operate or otherwise interfere with the private healthcare system.
1.7.3.4. Pro: The Swiss canton [Zug](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/31/taxavoidance.tax) has one of the lowest tax rates in the world. Despite its low population, it is one of the most prosperous economic centers in the world. There are more businesses registered there than there are citizens.
1.7.3.4.1. Con: The fact that there are more businesses registered in Switzerland should point to the idea that businesses are not concerned with the well-being of its community, but with making a profit.
1.7.3.4.1.1. Con: The two ideologies are not mutually exclusive. In fact, profit depends on community support. Only satisfied customers are repeat customers. Companies who disregard the well-being of the community will quickly lose its customers.
1.7.3.5. Con: [Healthcare is compulsory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Switzerland) in Switzerland, which is a politically and economically authoritarian policy.
1.7.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.7.3.3.
1.7.3.6. Con: Switzerland achieves a high wage through [union support](https://www.ch.ch/en/minimum-wage-and-average-earnings/), not through libertarian principles.
1.7.3.6.1. Con: No minimum wage is one such libertarian principle in action in Switzerland. Should they ever impose a minimum wage, the Swiss economy would likely see a major [increase production costs and unemployment rates](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27459178).
1.7.3.6.1.1. Con: Minimum wage is not used in Switzerland because no one is paid below the [standard of living](http://www.businessinsider.com/switzerland-is-better-than-america-2014-7). This is not the case in countries like the United States.
1.7.3.6.1.1.1. Con: Ironically, increasing the minimum wage necessarily [increases the cost of living](https://www.thoughtco.com/reasons-raising-the-minimum-wage-can-hurt-the-economy-3303554). Low cost of living could be achieved in America by removing the minimum wage, among other things.
1.7.3.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Repealing the minimum wage may mean a lower cost of living, but it would also mean that many more people could not afford the cost of living since they are not being paid enough.
1.7.3.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Wages may rise organically without minimum wage due to competition between lower-wage employers for employees. With a set minimum wage, they all pay the same, and this no longer happens.
1.7.3.6.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is also the effect of a race to the bottom for wages by employees.
1.7.3.6.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no such thing. [Switzerland](https://www.fff.org/2016/04/07/minimum-wage-smartness-switzerland/) has no minimum wage, yet they have some of the highest wages in the world. Work is subject to the laws of supply and demand just as any product is. This actually causes an upward trend in pay, as companies offer higher wages for the best employees, as they can hire more people. Unskilled workers can then get jobs they normally would never have been hired for, because they can be paid less. This allows them to gain work experience and achieve higher pay later.
1.7.3.6.2. Con: A libertarian government would not likely prohibit labor unions. They can coexist with other libertarian principles in achieving economic prosperity.
1.7.3.6.2.1. Con: A libertarian government is not necessary to achieve union support. Unions are not an advantage of libertarianism.
1.7.3.6.2.1.1. Con: A libertarian government and unions could theoretically synergize for the greatest benefit. Any form of government that restricts the corporate environment too much risks diminishing the effect of unions on high wages.
1.7.3.6.2.1.1.1. Con: A libertarian government could synergise with corporations to crush union support. Since most right-libertarian philosophy is pro-business, this seems more likely.
1.7.3.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Crushing unions would require legislation infringing on the freedom of the worker to form them. The most likely outcome would be for a libertarian government to take no sides on the matter, allowing both businesses and their workers freedom to do as they please. A libertarian government, with a very open free-market philosophy, combined with the fact that unions would still be allowed to form \(even without government support\) would have a synergistic effect without the two ever working together.
1.7.3.6.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Crushing unions would not require legislation at all. All it would require is a pro-business viewpoint by the people tasked with arbitration.
1.7.3.6.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Libertarianism, both on the left and the right, is concerned with individual freedom. Those tasked with arbitration would be trying to balance the individual rights of the employers with the individual rights of the employees. They may favor businesses overall, but individual cases may differ. The point of arbitration is to decide case-by-case, and in some cases, a union may come out on top. They are not, however, deliberately forbidden from existing.
1.8. Con: Significant government involvement is required to create the security necessary for fulfilling human relationships.
1.8.1. Con: Every attempt in history to create such communal integration has been a failure.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Individuals do not share the same needs or desires. Some choose to be lazy, where, in a communal society, they would be kept afloat through programs designed to abolish poverty and homelessness. The more people who do this, the larger the financial strain becomes on those who still choose to work. And, without the ability to rise above, the incentive to work harder is lost. Eventually everyone will stop working.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Laziness and the sort of 'free riding' activity mentioned here is deeply unsatisfying; few people can wish to spend their lives on such activities but would rather contribute to their communities, families, and societies.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: The number of people who would choose to be lazy would far outweigh those who would choose to work for no personal gain. Whether or not it is ‘unsatisfying’ fails to outweigh basic human instincts in most cases.
1.8.1.1.1.2. Con: Many people would choose to be artists rather than work laborious jobs. This can be simultaneously very satisfying while not contributing anything of value in a survival sense.
1.8.1.1.2. Con: "Working hard," in the sense that it seems to be used here, is not an end in itself, and does not lead to moral and fulfilling lives. Thus that a form of government does not use a competitive market to coerce its people into working hard is hardly to its detriment
1.8.1.1.2.1. Con: A fulfilling life is a result of achieving what one desires, and in many cases, only a free market can provide those desires.
1.8.1.1.3. Con: People are not motivated to work only by their desire to rise above others, but also by their desire to improve themselves as individuals
1.8.1.1.3.1. Con: When everything one creates is taken and redistributed, this motivation quickly fades.
1.8.1.1.3.2. Con: Most necessary jobs in a communal society don't provide the individual any opportunity to improve without financial gain.
1.9. Pro: Government policy is carried out via violence and threats of violence, but violence is not an appropriate tool for dealing with most issues.
1.9.1. Pro: Despite the possibility of really bad decisions, [modern sociologists say](http://institut2080.cz/publikujeme/proc-je-masa-moudrejsi-nez-elity) any decision made by society is better than the decision made by the government. It is nearly impossible to separate politician from elitist, and elitists rarely think about real problems.
1.10. Pro: Standing armies would shrink both in size and in scope. No army would want to fight on any purely aggressive war. If not commanded by politicians, soldiers would only want to fight defensive wars. This is so because wars are normally waged because the interests of a few people - normally politicians and their friends, as in crony capitalism, or alternatively by totalitarian politicians, just because of their beliefs... Huge savings there!
1.11. Pro: People understand that cooperation gives better outcomes for everyone compared to confrontation. There is no need for the government to force people to cooperate.
1.12. Pro: Any government's attempts to provide 'top-down', pre-meditated solutions for problems society might face are less optimal than 'bottom-up', spontaneously emerging solutions that result from free and voluntary interactions of individuals.
