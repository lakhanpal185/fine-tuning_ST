Discussion Title: Should HPV Vaccinations be Compulsory?

1. Countries should force parents to vaccinate their children against HPV.
1.1. Con: The vaccine has [potential side effects](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv-vaccine.html), which range from more mild \(pain at the injection site, fever and fainting\) to adverse effects \(anaphylaxis\). It therefore should not be made compulsory.
1.1.1. Con: The side effects are generally mild, and short-term. There is no evidence to support the idea that the long-term serious adverse events listed are caused by the vaccines.
1.1.2. Con: Several trials and studies have proven HPV vaccines to be safe, with extremely low rates of serious possible side effects. What little scientific research has been done contradicting this consensus has consistently been shown to be flawed and unreliable.
1.1.2.1. Pro: [Nine studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4262378/table/t4-ijwh-6-999/) were carried out to research associations between HPV vaccines and a wide range of conditions and symptoms, including serious ones like stroke, appendicitis, paralysis and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome \(an immune disorder that causes weakness\). In almost all cases, the research found no difference between vaccinated and control groups in the prevalence of the conditions, with the exception of temporary problems like fainting and skin irritation.
1.1.2.2. Pro: A systematic [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21226933/) of existing research concluded that the prevalence of serious adverse events was not different between vaccinated and control groups. Another [2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3034689/) systematic review found the same results.
1.1.2.3. Con: When there is a potential harm, no matter how small, from a medical procedure, it is unethical to force that medical procedure because it violates informed consent regardless of the severity of those potential side effects.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Studies on over 6.6 million women \([4 mill](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25562266), [1.6 mill](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25005658) and [1 mill](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805482/)\) show no difference in adverse health outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated women, instead attributing vasovagal syncope \(fainting\) to fear of needles.
1.1.3. Pro: A [research study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16002036) published in April 2016 tracked the rate of adverse events following immunization among women and girls aged nine and older in Canada between 2006 and 2014. The study found that out of 195,270 girls and women vaccinated, 192 reported adverse events.
1.1.3.1. Con: Only four out of the 195,270 vaccinated individuals \(0.002%\) reported a serious side effect \(one warranting a trip to the hospital\).
1.1.4. Con: Anaphylaxis only occurs if the patient is [allergic](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv-vaccine.html) to the vaccination, in which case they should not take it at all. It is not something inherent in the vaccine, and a significant majority will not experience it.
1.1.4.1. Con: Patients are warned about three major possible [allergens](https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/g/gardasil/gardasil_ppi.pdf) contained in the HPV vaccine; yeast, amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate, and polysorbate 80. While most people would be aware of an allergy they have to yeast, the other two allergens are not regularly encountered by most people, so it is likely some people will not know if they are allergic to them until after they receive the vaccine and have an adverse reaction.
1.1.4.2. Con: Allergic reactions are not the only concern with respect to vaccine injury from the HPV vaccine. The  main controversy about this vaccine in the medical literature has had to do with the use of the neurotoxin aluminum as an adjuvant.[acpeds.org](http://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/health-issues/new-concerns-about-the-human-papillomavirus-vaccine)
1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.1.6. Pro: The HPV vaccine contains [aluminum](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013417303380), a known neurotoxin that can be persistent in the body and be carried by macrophages to the brain, where it accumulates.
1.1.6.1. Con: HPV vaccine contains about 0.5 mg of Aluminum per dose. [CHOP/vaccine site](http://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum) Most teens & adults "ingest" 5-10 mg of Aluminum per day from food, water, & other\(industrial/occupational\) exposures \(see Wikipedia: aluminum toxicity\). So it's a drop in the bucket.
1.2. Con: State-run voluntary vaccination programmes receive significant uptake.
1.2.1. Con: In the United States, HPV vaccination uptake has fallen [below optimal levels](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0730-hpv.html) for effective protection of the population.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Only 6 out of 10 parents in the US get their children [vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/infographics/vacc-coverage.html) for HPV, still leaving 40% of the population vulnerable to the virus.
1.2.2. Con: HPV vaccination is [done](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/hpv.html) in three doses over the course of 6 to 12 months. Because of the dragged out process of this vaccination, not everyone follows through on the second and third dose, posing a significant barrier to voluntary vaccination programs.
1.2.2.1. Pro: [Less](https://www.livescience.com/36951-hpv-vaccine-series-miss-dose.html) than one third of young U.S. women who receive one HPV shot complete the full series.
1.2.2.2. Pro: The time between the separate doses can be up to [24](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/how-is-hpv-vaccine-cervarix-gardasil-given.aspx) months sometimes. People can easily forget or simply no longer care about the vaccination two years after the first dose was given.
1.2.3. Con: There are [false rumours](https://www.snopes.com/medical/drugs/gardasil.asp) about the HPV vaccine perpetuated by non-experts. Parents are more easily scared by these than the state, the latter of whom are more likely to base their decision on the suitability of the vaccine only on expert opinions.
1.2.3.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3408795/) in the United States found that one of the main reasons parents oppose the vaccination is because they believe it increases the likelihood their daughter will engage in sexually promiscuous behaviour.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Studies [disprove](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/10/10/peds.2012-1516) the rumoured link between the HPV vaccine and increased sexual activity in young girls.
1.2.3.2. Con: The observation that some claims against the vaccine are false does not belie the fact that there is scientific evidence the HPV vaccine causes [serious injuries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28730271) in some individuals. Especially concerning is its aluminum content, a known neurotoxin that accumulates in the brain. The decision to vaccinate is a matter of personal choice.
1.2.3.3. Con: It is equally true that many pro-vaccine arguments are perpetuated by non-experts; moreover many claims made about the benefits and risks of vaccines by "experts" are false. [bmj.com](http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f3037)
1.2.4. Pro: HPV [coverage](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/578729/HPV_vaccination-_2015-16.pdf) in England for Year 8 and 9 girls is just under 90%. This has been achieved under a [voluntary program](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/hpv-vaccination-parents-rights.aspx) where the NHS offers to vaccinate girls aged 12-13.
1.2.5. Con: In Germany, with a voluntary vaccination program, the number of women who get vaccinated is significantly below the 70% mark, leaving a large portion of the population susceptible to the virus \([p 70](http://www.hpvcentre.net/statistics/reports/DEU.pdf)\).
1.2.6. Pro: Since the HPV Immunisation Programme was established in New Zealand in 2008, [more than 200,000](http://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/healthy-living/immunisation/immunisation-older-children/human-papillomavirus-hpv/questions-and-answers-about-hpv-immunisation) girls and women have been fully immunised.
1.2.7. Pro: Since the Irish government began offering the vaccine to girls in their first year of secondary education, the lowest recorded uptake rate was [72.3%](http://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vaccinepreventable/vaccination/immunisationuptakestatistics/hpvimmunisationuptakestatistics/).
1.2.8. Con: There has been strong opposition to HPV vaccines in a lot of countries.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Civil lawsuits have been filed against manufacturers of the HPV vaccine Gardasil in [Spain](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/854798), [France](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/sanofi-france-sued-in-france-over-gardasil-vaccine-/), [India](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2908963/Judges-demand-answers-children-die-controversial-cancer-vaccine-trial-India.html) and [Colombia](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/883873).
1.2.8.1.1. Con: A lawsuit having been filed does not necessarily indicate the vaccines are actually unsafe.
1.2.8.2. Pro: The Health Ministry of Japan withdrew its support of the vaccine in 2013 amid [reports of serious side effects](http://medshadow.org/medshadow_blog/hpv-vaccine-vs-pap-smear/) in girls.
1.2.8.2.1. Con: The Japanese government withdrew its recommendation that girls get the HPV vaccine [based](https://login.medscape.com/login/sso/getlogin?urlCache=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVkc2NhcGUuY29tL3ZpZXdhcnRpY2xlLzgwNjY0NQ==&ac=401) on concerns from the public, not any scientific evidence.
1.2.8.2.2. Con: These side effects were dismissed by large [European](http://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/hpv-vaccine-safety-european-medicines-agency-review/) and [Australian](http://www.cancer.org.au/news/blog/prevention/australian-study-first-to-assess-real-world-impact-of-hpv-vaccine-on-cervical-cancer.html) studies, something Japan chose to ignore. This is far from proof that the vaccine is harmful.
1.2.8.2.3. Con: Japans Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology is [battling](http://www.jsog.or.jp/english/declaration_20150829.html) to reverse the recommendation. Their own gynecologists don't agree with their decision.
1.2.8.3. Con: Most of the opposition to the HPV vaccine comes from parents, not medical experts.
1.2.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.3. Pro: The vaccine against HPV has enormous health benefits and thus protects young girls from becoming sick later on in their lives.
1.3.1. Pro: The vaccine can lead to a [reduction](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0105967) in genital warts.
1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.3.3. Con: Because the cancer takes 10 to 20 years to develop, it is [difficult](https://medshadow.org/features/pros-cons-hpv-vaccine/) to assess the effect of HPV vaccinations on cancer outcomes.
1.3.3.1. Pro: To gain licensure, the HPV vaccine manufacturers were not required to and did not provide studies showing that the vaccine actually reduces the risk of cancer. Instead, the FDA used the surrogate marker of antibody titers against the target strains of HPV considered to be protective. As noted in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 2014, "it may be many years before the effect on HPV vaccination on the incidence of cervical cancer can be assessed."[academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/106/3/djt460/981483)
1.3.3.2. Con: It is valid to use a surrogate endpoint\(reduction in HPV infection\) when that surrogate is know to be a precursor of the ultimate clinical endpoint\(in this case, cancer\) and when decades of follow-up would be required to observe any reduction in the clinical endpoint. Cervical cancer develops decades after initial infection with HPV.
1.3.4. Pro: Alternative methods of preventing HPV are ineffective.
1.3.4.1. Con: HPV is a sexually transmitted disease. As long as sexually active people use contraception \(condoms\) correctly, there is no need for compulsory vaccination.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: [Hospital transmission](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1477576/) of HPV, especially to surgical staff, has been documented.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Hospital staff can be infected by all kinds of diseases due to their job, so it makes sense to vaccinate them instead of the general public.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The HPV vaccination is more effective at a [younger age](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/hpv/vac-faqs.htm), except children do not know if they will end up working as a doctor or a nurse at that age. It makes sense, therefore, to vaccinate everyone.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: HPV vaccine produces a [higher immune response](http://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/questions-answers.html) in preteens than it does in older teens and young women.
1.3.4.1.1.1.2. Con: In order to properly protect populations, vaccines require herd immunity. Even if hospital workers were most acutely at risk, this would be a bad way to protect them.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: Condoms do [not completely protect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus#cite_note-Egendorf2007-55) from the virus because the areas around the genitals including the inner thigh area are not covered, thus exposing these areas to the infected personâs skin.
1.3.4.1.3. Con: Condoms can break or fail.
1.3.4.1.3.1. Con: Condoms can still [decrease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2492590/) the risk of transmission of HPV.
1.3.4.1.3.1.1. Con: The [same study says](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2492590/) that the exact effectiveness has 'not been fully elucidated', and that 'women having sexual contact with men who use condoms are still at risk of acquiring an infection, as condoms are not 100% protective'.
1.3.4.1.3.2. Con: If used correctly, condoms will prevent transmission of the virus [98%](https://www.livescience.com/18661-14-common-condom-errors.html) of the time. This is hardly a sufficiently significant issue to mandate vaccinations.
1.3.4.1.4. Con: Non-consensual sex may not afford a victim the capacity to insist on the use of a condom, thus exposing them to HPV and other sexually transmitted diseases.
1.3.4.1.5. Con: Many sexually active people don't use condoms correctly or at all.
1.3.4.1.5.1. Pro: Most young people who engage in oral sex use barrier protection [inconsistently](https://www.guttmacher.org/journals/psrh/2006/oral-sex-and-condom-use-among-young-people-united-kingdom), if at all.
1.3.4.1.5.2. Pro: A [study](http://www.thebodypro.com/content/78711/its-time-to-start-thinking-about-anal-sex-as-a-ris.html) found that women are 60% less likely to use a condom during anal sex than during vaginal sex.
1.3.4.1.6. Pro: Irrespective of protection, faithful and monogamous couples do not need to be concerned.
1.3.4.1.6.1. Con: Even monogamous partners can cheat on each other; such infidelity risks the spread of HPV.
1.3.4.1.6.2. Con: HPV can be transmitted to individuals before they decided to enter a monogamous relationship.
1.3.4.1.6.2.1. Pro: Most people have several sexual partners before settling down with one.
1.3.4.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: The average age of losing one's virginity in the U.S. is approximatelyÂ [17](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/american-teens-sexual-and-reproductive-health)  years, yet the average age of marriage is [28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_age_at_first_marriage).
1.3.4.1.6.2.2. Pro: HPV can remain [dormant](http://ahcchpv.com/hpv-dormant-period/) or undetected for years so it is possible for someone to be infected for a long time without even knowing it.
1.3.4.1.6.3. Con: Sexual intercourse is not the only way HPV can be transferred.
1.3.4.1.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.
1.3.4.1.6.4. Con: Faithful and monogamous *individuals* still need to be concerned of risks caused by their partners' behavior, which are beyond their control
1.3.4.1.6.5. Con: Vacccination programs do not obviate the need for risk-avoidant behavior. The two recommendations are not mutually exclusive.
1.3.4.1.7. Con: HPV can be[transmitted to newborns](https://www.healthline.com/health/sexually-transmitted-diseases/hpv-and-pregnancy) during pregnancy and birth. This is not prevented by condom usage.
1.3.4.2. Pro: HPV can be transmitted through both anal and oral sex, as well as vaginal.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.5.2.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.5.1.
1.3.5. Pro: A large volume of scientific research proves the efficacy of HPV vaccines.
1.3.5.1. Pro: A 2011 [meta-analysis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3034689/) evaluated the results of seven separate randomized control tests, and found that HPV vaccines are safe, well tolerated, and highly efficacious in preventing persistent infections and cervical diseases.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: This study also concluded that "Questions related to long-term efficacy and safety" of the HPV vaccine "have yet to be addressed."[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3034689/)
1.3.5.2. Pro: A 2014 [meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4174682/) evaluated the results of 15 previous scientific studies \(10 randomized control tests and five observational studies\). It found the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing HPV 16 and 18 \(the two most serious strains\) ranged from 83% to 94%.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: Of the studies included in this meta-analysis, "Only one study was not initiated and funded by a vaccine manufacturer." The purpose of this review was also to assess the long-term effectiveness of the vaccine, and only two studies were considered long-term \(6-7 years\), one of which had a "high" risk of bias, and overall evidence quality was "low to very low".[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4174682/)
1.3.5.3. Pro: The clinical trials which were the basis for Gardasil being licensed found that the vaccine was effective in 88.7% of cases.\([Pg.13](http://www.hpra.ie/docs/default-source/vaccine-pils/gardasil-smpc.pdf?sfvrsn=0)\)
1.3.6. Pro: There is no [treatment](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/treatment.htm) for the virus itself although health problems caused by HPV can be treated. It is better to be vaccinated and avoid the infection than invest time and money in treating problems caused by it.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Once the virus enters the bloodstream, it [cannot be eliminated](https://www.healthline.com/health/std/genital-warts#diagnosis6). So one may have multiple outbreaks of warts over the course of a lifetime. As the symptoms often don't appear in time, a vaccination is the only effective way of dealing with the virus.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: The claim that "vaccination is the only effective way of dealing with the virus" is an unsupported opinion. To illustrate, there are no studies showing that HPV vaccine actually reduce the risk of cancer compared to routine pap smear screening.
1.3.6.2. Con: The argument "It is better..." is strictly an opinion that others may disagree with. For example, one might consider the potential risk from the vaccine of its use of aluminum adjuvant, a known neurotoxin that scientists now know is persistent in the body and accumulates in the brain,[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013417303380) and decide that routine pap smears are sufficient.
1.3.7. Con: Labeling something as "good" does not grant government the moral right to force it upon the population. Vitamin supplements can improve health, but we would not expect the government to legislate mandatory vitamins to combat poor diets.
1.3.8. Con: The claim that the HPV vaccine "protects young girls from becoming sick later on in their lives" presumably refers to the manufacturers' marketing claim that the vaccine prevents cervical cancer. However, while studies show the vaccine reduces infection of some strains of HPV, no studies have shown that the HPV vaccine actually reduces the risk of developing cervical cancer compared to routine screening alone.
1.3.8.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.3.9. Pro: According to the WHO, two HPV vaccines, a bivalent and a quadrivalent vaccine, are [highly efficacious](http://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/hpv/en/) in preventing the infection with the strains of HPV responsible for 70% of cervical cancer cases globally.
1.3.9.1. Pro: Early clinical trials conducted on the HPV vaccine suggest it has [life-saving potential](http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/annualReports/HPV/Part1Sect3.htm#ref2).
1.3.9.2. Pro: The Food & Drug Administration \(FDA\) in the US has [approved](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-vaccine-fact-sheet) the vaccines Gardasil and Gardasil 9 for use in females ages 9 through 26 for the prevention of HPV-caused cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers, as well as precancerous cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal lesions.
1.3.9.2.1. Con: The vaccine received FDA approval despite the fact that no clinical studies were done demonstrating that Gardasil prevents cancer.
1.3.9.3. Con: A HPV infection can take years to result in cervical cancer. That leaves plenty of time for screening, treatment and prevention, [eliminating](http://info.cmsri.org/the-driven-researcher-blog/is-there-objective-evidence-that-the-current-hpv-vaccination-programs-are-not-justified) the need for compulsory vaccinations.
1.3.9.3.1. Con: Once contracted, HPV could lead to cancer at any point in time, necessitating regular, deeply invasive, checks, which will not necessarily detect cancer in time.
1.3.9.4. Con: Given the risks and side effects of the HPV vaccine, it should not be added to a cervical cancer prevention program when Pap screening has been proven safe and effective, particularly when the need for Pap screening is not eliminated by HPV vaccine administration.
1.3.9.4.1. Pro: Regular Pap screening decreases cervix cancer incidence and mortality by at least [80%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0032704/).
1.3.9.4.2. Con: [80%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071564/) of cervical cancer cases occur in the developing world where the resources and infrastructure required to fully implement Pap tests are limited.
1.3.9.4.2.1. Pro: It has been [estimated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071564/#__sec1title) that only about 5% of women in developing countries have been screened for cervical dysplasia in the past 5 years, compared with 40% to 50% of women in developed countries.
1.3.9.4.3. Con: Pap screening is inherently a reactionary process - it does not prevent cervical cancer, only increase the chances of detecting it early enough to prevent death. Treatment at that point can still be invasive, and have [serious side-effects](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/cervical-cancer/treatment-options), including harm to reproductive or sexual function.
1.3.9.5. Pro: The HPV vaccine also protects against other types of cancer.
1.3.9.5.1. Pro: The vaccine also may prevent against another type of cancer: [throat cancer](http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/29/32/4294.full).
1.3.9.5.2. Pro: The HPV vaccines prevent the strains of HPV that cause the majority of cases of [anal cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-fact-sheet).
1.3.9.5.3. Con: This claim is unsupported by evidence. As noted in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the FDA did not require the vaccine manufacturers to produce clinical trials showing effectiveness at preventing cancer; instead, the FDA used the surrogate marker of an antibody titer against the target strains considered protective. As the authors noted, "it may be many years before the effect on HPV vaccination on the incidence of cervical cancer can be assessed."[academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/106/3/djt460/981483)
1.3.9.6. Con: The FDA approved the HPV vaccine on the basis of clinical trials that were not properly designed to assess safety.[slate.com](https://slate.com/health-and-science/2017/12/flaws-in-the-clinical-trials-for-gardasil-made-it-harder-to-properly-assess-safety.html)
1.3.9.7. Con: The vaccine itself has not been studied for mutagenic effects. As Merck's package insert for Gardasil states, for example, "GARDASIL has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity."[fda.gov](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM111263.pdf)
1.3.9.8. Con: Only a small [proportion](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs380/en/) of infections with certain types of HPV can persist and progress to cancer. Hence mandatory vaccination appears to be an excessive measure.
1.3.9.8.1. Con: There is a very large number of HPV infections in the world. Over [26.6](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/205774)% of women in the world have HPV infections. It's estimated by WHO that HPV causes [5.2%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3038604/) of all worldwide new cancers.
1.3.9.8.2. Pro: 90% of HPV infections go away without treatment within three years, and out of the remainder, only a [tiny minority](http://info.cmsri.org/the-driven-researcher-blog/is-there-objective-evidence-that-the-current-hpv-vaccination-programs-are-not-justified) lead to cancer.
1.3.9.8.3. Con: As the link observes, the cervical cancer vaccine targets the two types of HPV responsible for 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous lesions. It is precisely that "small" set of infections that the vaccine targets.
1.3.10. Con: One out of 100 women gets infected with the specific types of HPV that the [vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus#Vaccines) are developed for. Hence mandatory vaccination appears to be an excessive measure.
1.3.10.1. Con: One out of a 100 is a very high number, that is one percent of the female population of a country. Vaccinating them, in order to save them and eliminate the cost of treating them for that cancer, is a very small price to pay.
1.3.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.9.8.
1.3.10.3. Con: Cervical cancer is the [fourth-most common](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs380/en/) cancer among women worldwide, and has a 52% global mortality rate. Two of the four cancer-causing strains of HPV targeted by the vaccine are responsible for ~70% of cervical cancer cases.
1.4. Pro: Countries would benefit financially from cancer prevention. Cancer medicine is more costly for private and public health systems than HPV vaccines. This creates added costs to any country that subsidises cancer medicine and treatment, not to mention it puts added strain on medical facilities.
1.4.1. Con: Vaccines can have potential long-term side effects that also create burdens on the public. It is impossible to accurately calculate the cost/benefit of each choice from a financial viewpoint in a future where technology may change.
1.5. Pro: The HPV virus is sufficiently harmful to mandate compulsory vaccination.
1.5.1. Pro: Some types of HPV can lead to [cancer](https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/cancer.html) of the cervix, vulva, vagina, or anus. HPV infection can also cause cancer in the back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Nearly all [cervical cancers](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/infectious-agents/hpv/hpv-and-cancer-info.html) are caused by HPV. This type of cancer will lead to the [death](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/cervical-cancer/statistics) of an estimated 4,210 women in the US in this year alone.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: About 3,100 cases of cervical cancer are [diagnosed](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/infections-hpv-and-cancer/hpv-and-cancer) in the UK each year. Nearly all are related to HPV.
1.5.1.2. Pro: An [estimated](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/vaginal-cancer/statistics) 1,240 women in the US will die from vaginal cancer this year; most of these cancers will [contain](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/infectious-agents/hpv/hpv-and-cancer-info.html) HPV.
1.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.9.4.
1.5.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.
1.5.2. Pro: HPV is so [common](https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/whatishpv.html) that nearly all men and women get it at some point in their lives. It is clearly worth making the vaccination compulsory.
1.5.2.1. Pro: HPV is [transmitted](https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/whatishpv.html) through intimate skin-to-skin contact, particularly by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the virus. As the vast majority of individuals across the globe will partake in such intercourse at some stage of their lives, they should be protected.
1.5.2.2. Pro: HPV can be passed on even when an infected person has [no signs or symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/whatishpv.html), so there is no way to protect yourself from it apart from getting a vaccination for it.
1.5.2.3. Pro: The Centre for Disease Control estimates that [approximately](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/hpv-genital-warts/hpv-symptoms-tests) 80 million men and women have it in the US.
1.5.3. Pro: HPV can [cause](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Genital_warts/Pages/Introduction.aspx) genital warts.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Although rare, genital warts can be [passed on to a baby](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/genital-warts) during vaginal childbirth. If this happens, it can cause an [infection](https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/genital-warts/?WT.mc_id=organic_split) in the baby's throat or genitals.
1.5.3.2. Con: Genital warts are usually painless and [do not](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Genital_warts/Pages/Introduction.aspx) pose a serious threat to health.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: Genital warts aren't fatal but can [cause](https://www.healthline.com/health/std/genital-warts#symptoms2) vaginal discharge, itching, bleeding and a burning feeling on the infected area.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Con: It remains true that the vaccination entails risk, and as such, it is up to the individual to weigh the potential risks and benefits and decide for themselves whether this medical intervention is right for them. As an example of the risk, the HPV vaccine contains aluminum adjuvant, which is a known neurotoxin that scientists now know is persistent in the body and can be carried by macrophages into the brain.[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013417303380)
1.5.3.2.1.2. Con: Mandatory vaccination takes away an individual's right to choose with informed consent, and without informed consent it is medically unethical to force a medicine, medical procedure, or surgery upon the patient.
1.5.3.3. Pro: The virus can live in the body for [months and years](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/genital-warts/what-are-symptoms-genital-warts) before developing into genital warts, during which time you can pass it onto others without realising it.
1.5.3.3.1. Con: Adults engaging in consensual intercourse must accept the known risks of that activity. The fact engaging in sex entails risk does not negate the fact that vaccination also entails risk, and it remains up to the individual to weight the potential benefits and risks and decide for themselves if vaccination is right for them.
1.5.3.4. Pro: Getting a HPV vaccination is better than treating genital warts after they have occurred.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: Genital warts treatment can [cost](http://health.costhelper.com/genital-warts.html) anywhere between $300 to $8000, whereas a complete series of HPV vaccinations [costs](http://www.arhp.org/Publications-and-Resources/Patient-Resources/Fact-Sheets/Understanding-HPV-Vaccine) $450.
1.5.3.4.1.1. Con: This argument is implying that HPV vaccination provides a net economic benefit to society, but the two costs presented are not the only costs that need to be considered to make that judgment. Other costs requiring consideration include the costs to society from vaccine injury and the opportunity cost of directing funding toward vaccination. The implied argument is unsupported with any studies showing a net economic benefit.
1.5.3.4.2. Pro: Women who have been diagnosed with genital warts may need to have Pap smears every 3 to 6 months after their initial treatment to [monitor](https://www.healthline.com/health/std/genital-warts#treatment7) any changes in the cervix. It is better to be vaccinated rather than engage in such a lengthy treatment process.
1.5.3.4.2.1. Con: This is a recklessly irresponsible statement as routine screening for cervical cancer even with vaccination is still recommended. If the public gets the idea they don't need screening because they were vaccinated, it could lead to an increase in cancer that otherwise could have been prevented by early detection in routine screening.
1.5.3.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
1.5.3.4.4. Con: The claim is strictly an opinion. People seriously injured by the HPV vaccine would likely feel differently about it.
1.5.4. Con: The viral infection, more often than not, [clears](http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/hpv-genital-warts/hpv-treatment-is-there-hpv-cure) to undetectable levels by itself.
1.5.4.1. Con: Yet it does not clear itself in all cases, and it is exactly for those cases that we should enforce vaccination.
1.5.4.2. Con: The viral infection sometimes [develops](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-fact-sheet) into cancer.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.9.
1.5.4.3. Con: We vaccinate against many viruses that clear by themselves in most cases. Measles has only a mortality rate of 0.2%, yet [caused 2.6 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles) deaths worldwide in 1980.
1.5.4.4. Pro: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the bodyâs immune system clears HPV naturally within [two years](http://www.cdc.gov/std/HPV/STDFact-HPV.htm)Â for 90% of cases.
1.5.5. Con: Heart attacks are "sufficiently harmful" but we do not mandate healthy diet and exercise by regulation in order to prevent them.
1.5.5.1. Con: Unlike a vaccine, prescribing and supervising a healthy diet is nigh impossible.
1.5.6. Con: The government should not intervene in personal medical choices and infringe on the rights of the people.
1.5.6.1. Pro: One of the main values of modern states is the protection of personal autonomy and self-determination. To force individuals to act in a certain way, in this case to force parents to let their daughters get vaccinated, is contrarian to this.
1.5.6.1.1. Pro: Government or the officials should speak out their recommendations, offer consultation, deliver proper information about HPV vaccination and trust in the citizen's critical decision-making capabilities.
1.5.6.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.5.6.1.2. Pro: Freedom over oneâs physical person is the most basic freedom of all, and people in a free society should be sovereign over their own bodies.
1.5.6.1.2.1. Pro: When we give government the power to make medical decisions for us, we in essence accept that the state owns our bodies. That contradicts our freedom over one's physical person.
1.5.6.1.2.2. Con: Young children are not capable of making decisions about their health and well-being. These responsibilities lie in the hands of the parents. If parents are negligent, for example refusing medical treatment, the state can intervene.
1.5.6.1.2.3. Con: In this case, the child is not making decisions for themselves either way. It is therefore unclear why, having accepted that they do not have that autonomy, it should vest exclusively in their parents.
1.5.6.1.3. Con: Modern countries have made and make a lot of laws that go against the personal autonomy of individuals.
1.5.6.1.3.1. Pro: Child car seats had to be enforced by the government, as many parents did not buy them.
1.5.6.1.3.2. Pro: Hard drugs have been banned by states.
1.5.6.1.3.3. Pro: Mandatory protective gear when motor-cycling had to be enforced by the state.
1.5.6.1.3.4. Pro: Mandatory seat-belts had to be enforced by the state.
1.5.6.1.3.5. Con: The fact that many states violate individual rights does not justify the violation of individual rights.
1.5.6.1.4. Pro: According to John Locke, the purpose of the government is to [protect our natural rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights) and not to interfere with them.
1.5.6.1.5. Con: Being healthy and alive is the basis for personal autonomy and self-determination. Thus, a state looking out for its citizens to stay healthy can be regarded as the purest form of protecting personal autonomy and self-determination.
1.5.6.2. Pro: It is the parents who are responsible for the health and well-being of their children, thus a vaccination should be their call and not forced upon them by the state.
1.5.6.2.1. Con: Many children will, at a later stage, wish that they had received the vaccination, especially if they suffer from adverse affects of the virus. The state should therefore pre-emptively vaccinate young girls.
1.5.6.2.1.1. Pro: Getting vaccinated against HPV is recommended [before](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-vaccine-young-women.htm) becoming sexually active so it is important that children get vaccinated at a young age.
1.5.6.2.1.2. Pro: As long as it is not compulsory, parents who are opposed to vaccination might put their childrens' health in danger by not vaccinating them against HPV.
1.5.6.2.1.2.1. Con: Parents know better what to do with their children than the state, so it is not necessary to tell them what they should do.
1.5.6.2.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.5.6.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Parents have specific knowledge of their individual children that the state does not. They can use this specific knowledge to make better decisions for their children than the state can.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2. Pro: Regarding their health, thus life, children should not be solely dependent on their parents' personal bias.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Children have specific rights and should be treated as individuals.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2. Con: In many vitally important issues regarding their child, parents are the only ones responsible.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Parents usually have the legal and moral authority to act as surrogates for their children.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.6.1.3.1.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: Permission of the parents is first required in order to carry out medical procedures on those under the age of 18.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1. Con: This is not always, or even usually, the case. In many countries, the age of medical consent is lower \(16, or even younger\), and children can consent to medical treatments even below that age.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: In most jurisdictions, adolescents can consent to certain medical treatments without the consent of their parents, and courts and laws can overrule parental decisions \(for example, to require that a child receive a blood transfusion against parental wishes\) where the health of the child is at stake. This is hardly an unrestricted authority.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: In the UK, girls have to [consent](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/hpv-vaccination-parents-rights.aspx) to being vaccinated. If they refuse, the parents cannot override their decision.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: In the UK, children below the age of medical consent who are [Gillick competent](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-protection-system/legal-definition-child-rights-law/gillick-competency-fraser-guidelines/) can consent to medical treatment, including if their parents disagree with their decision.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: In Australia, children below the age of medical consent who are [Gillick competent](http://www.healthlawcentral.com/decisions/consent-minors/) can consent to medical treatment, including if their parents disagree with their decision.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: The key point here is "consent". Whatever the legal age requirement, the decision to vaccinate is a personal one, and the mandatory vaccination is an egregious violation of the right to informed consent.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2. Con: In many jurisdictions, courts can overrule parents' decisions, and in some cases there are certain procedures that courts must approve in advance.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: In Australia, state Supreme Courts have parens patriae jurisdiction \(the power to make decisions for those unable to make them themselves\), and Family Courts have welfare provisions [allowing them to intervene to determine the proper course of medical treatment for a minor](http://www.healthlawcentral.com/decisions/consent-minors/).
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: In Australia, there are certain medical procedures that require the decision of a court to perform.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: The sterilisation of a young person with an intellectual disability [requires court approval](http://www.healthlawcentral.com/decisions/consent-minors/).
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: The termination of a minor who is not Gillick competent's pregnancy [requires court approval](https://jade.io/article/83861).
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.3. Pro: Both hormone treatment for gender identity disorder and sex reassignment surgery [require court approval](http://www.healthlawcentral.com/decisions/consent-minors/) if the patient is a minor.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.2.4. Pro: The withdrawal of medical treatment from a child [requires court approval](https://aifs.gov.au/publications/citizen-child-australian-law-and-childrens-rights/8-medical-procedures-children).
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.3. Con: The fact that the state "can" do something doesn't make it right.
1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.1.1.
1.5.6.2.1.3. Con: Presuming what a child will "wish" for in the future is conjecture and entirely subjective.
1.5.6.2.1.4. Con: There is enough doubt that this should be an ongoing discussion, at the least.
1.5.6.2.1.5. Con: Governments should never have "carte blanche" in determining what is "right" for its citizens.
1.5.6.2.1.5.1. Pro: Indeed, when government violates the right to informed consent, it assumes dictatorial powers with frightening implications.
1.5.6.2.1.6. Con: The argument that since some people hold such-and-such an opinion, therefore people who hold a different view should be made to undergo a medical intervention against their will is devoid of logic. This is a non sequitur fallacy.
1.5.6.2.2. Con: In most countries, the public health system is responsible for the health of its citizens. The state has a responsibility to keep its citizens healthy to the best of its ability.
1.5.6.2.2.1. Con: There is abundant evidence that the FDA and CDC are corrupt and serve the interests of the pharmaceutical industry rather than the public. For instance, the CDC tried to conceal data showing its varicella vaccine recommendation has done far more harm than good.[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3759842/) Conflicts of interest at the CDC have included members of its vaccine advisory council having financial ties to the industry.[upi.com](https://www.upi.com/UPI-Investigates-The-vaccine-conflict/44221058841736/)
1.5.6.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.
1.5.6.2.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.5.6.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.
1.5.6.2.6. Con: Parents' rights over their children are already limited. Laws exist in the status quo that restrict the rights of parents over their own children.
1.5.6.2.6.1. Pro: Many countries have [compulsory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_education) school attendance laws that prohibit parents from taking children out of school.
1.5.6.2.6.2. Pro: In Canada, if parents don't accept the [gender identity](http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/06/05/new-law-allows-government-to-take-children-away-if-parents-dont-accept-kids-gender-identity/) chosen by their children, the state can choose to take them away from their parents.
1.5.6.2.6.3. Pro: Parental autonomy is often overridden when it comes to questions of children's health and wellbeing.
1.5.6.2.6.3.1. Pro: Throughout the UN [Convention on the Rights of the Child](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx), there is an emphasis that when making decisions about the rights of children, its signatories will prioritise what is in the 'best interest' of the child as a 'primary consideration'. \(See, for example, article 3\).
1.5.6.2.6.3.2. Pro: Doctors can seek a court order to override the parents' wishes if it is in the child's [best interests](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1386845/When-doctors-dilemmas-become-legal-and-medical.html) to do so.
1.5.6.2.6.3.2.1. Pro: In a life-threatening situation, doctors can give the children of Jehovah's Witnesses a [blood transfusion](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/08/judge-rules-jehovahs-witness-boy-blood-transfusion), even if their parents refuse it \(on the grounds that their religion [condemns it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses).\)
1.5.6.2.6.3.2.2. Pro: Judges have concluded that parental authority is '[not unlimited](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/08/perth-judge-overrules-parents-of-six-year-old-boy-and-orders-chemotherapy-for-child).'
1.5.6.2.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: In [2016](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/08/perth-judge-overrules-parents-of-six-year-old-boy-and-orders-chemotherapy-for-child), a judge in Australia allowed a doctor to proceed with chemotherapy on a child's malignant brain tumor despite the principled objections of the parents.
1.5.6.2.6.3.3. Pro: Parents can lose custody of their children to the state, and their children may be permanently removed, if the parents are deemed unable to care for their children's safety and wellbeing.
1.5.6.2.6.3.3.1. Pro: For example, in Victoria, Australia, the court has powers to make [permanent care orders](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/cyafa2005252/s319.html) in respect of a child if such an order is in the child's best interests with reference to [matters](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/num_reg//cyafr2007n21o2007442/s18.html) such as the child's safety and wellbeing.
1.5.6.2.6.3.3.2. Pro: The California Supreme Court has ruled that if children face substantial risk of harm, the state can take [custody](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/07/20/parents-trying-to-control-kids-can-lose-custody-california-high-court-rules/) of the children.
1.5.6.2.6.3.3.3. Pro: Some states takes similar measures with the prison system. There are [preventive detention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_detention) regimes for [potential terrorists](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cca1995115/sch1.html) \(division 105\), [sex offenders](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ssoasa2009517/s3.html) and other [violent offenders](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/croa2006246/s5g.html) which may in certain cases result in imprisonment before a crime has been committed.
1.5.6.2.6.3.3.3.1. Con: Human rights protections in some countries prevent preventive detention from operating.
1.5.6.2.6.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: In the [US Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment), there is a guarantee of a "speedy and public trial". This prevents the detainment of those who are yet to commit a crime.
1.5.6.2.6.3.3.3.1.1.1. Con: However, in the US, non-American citizens may be taken to Guantanamo Bay if they are terrorist suspects and detained [indefinitely](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/americans-face-guantanamo-detention-obama). This is a form of prospective detention.
1.5.6.2.6.3.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that this happens does not mean it is legitimate or fair. Guantanamo Bay is [unlawful and fundamentally inhumane](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-serious-harm-of-the-prison-in-guantanamo-bay/2017/01/05/53a79bc2-d2d2-11e6-9651-54a0154cf5b3_story.html?utm_term=.e63de8c93299).
1.5.6.2.6.3.3.3.1.2. Pro: The detention of a person for prospective crimes violates rights to fair trial and freedom from arbitrary detention in contravention of Articles 9, 14  and 15 of the [International Convent on Civil and Political Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx).
1.5.6.2.6.3.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.2.6.2.
1.5.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.2.1.2.
1.5.6.4. Pro: Mandatory vaccines infringe upon constitutionally protected religious freedoms.
1.5.6.4.1. Con: Health is more important than hypothetical religious freedoms, so in that case one can sacrifice a part of his freedoms in order to save his health and live longer.
1.5.6.4.1.1. Con: What is most important is that a person decides what is most important to them. This is the basis of "freedom". Determining, for someone else, what is most important to them, is the exact opposite of freedom.
1.5.6.4.2. Pro: Several religions might oppose the mandatory HPV vaccination.
1.5.6.4.2.1. Con: This can be easily resolved with religious exemptions.
1.5.6.4.2.2. Con: These extremist religions are not a defence against a public health policy the same way ISIS acts of terror are not justified by their extreme form of Islamic beliefs.
1.5.6.4.2.3. Pro: [Amish](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2011/06/23/peds.2009-2599.full.pdf) communities do not view all vaccinations as "necessary" and some believe that vaccinations weaken the immune system.
1.5.6.4.2.4. Pro: The [Church of Illumination](http://www.soul.org/church-of-illumination/tenet-on-immunizations) states that "the teachings of the Church unequivocally affirm that injections of vaccines and inoculations are a violation of these biblical teachingsâ¦ Immunizations and vaccinations are a form of blood pollution because they have devastating effects on the regeneration of the soul that each Church member seeks to attain."
1.5.6.4.2.5. Pro: Jehova's Witnesses [disadvise](http://www.vaccineriskawareness.com/Vaccines-A-Religious-Contention-) of vaccinations.
1.5.6.4.2.6. Pro: The [Catholic Church](https://cogforlife.org/2005/07/03/vaccine-questions/), in a June 9, 2005 report about using vaccines made using cells from aborted fetuses, indicated that "there is a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines" to avoid the "evil" of actively or passively participating in anything that involves voluntary abortion.
1.5.6.4.2.6.1. Con: The cell line used to develop HPV vaccines are not from aborted fetuses but from a grown woman called Henrietta Lacks who gave here cells to science after she died from cervical cancer. Alternatively cell line C33A which is from another 66 year old woman N. Auersperg.
1.5.6.4.3. Con: The children did not make an informed decision to belong to a religion or not, thus they should not be influenced by religious doctrine until they themselves decide to belong to one.
1.5.6.4.3.1. Con: Children do not make an informed decision to be vaccinated or not, thus they should not be influenced by medical doctrine until they, themselves, decide to follow one.
1.5.6.5. Con: If the government feels that children will suffer at the hand of parents regarding some medical decisions, they have a duty to make actions compulsory.
1.5.6.5.1. Pro: There have been cases of governments determining that children of Jehovah's Witnesses should receive blood transfusions, even in the face of objections from their parents.
1.5.6.5.1.1. Pro: The [Supreme Court in Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/girl-s-forced-blood-transfusion-didn-t-violate-rights-top-court-1.858660) ruled on such a case, saying that 'such medical interventions are constitutionally sound, striking a balance between the choice of the child and the state's protection of the child.'
1.5.6.5.1.1.1. Con: Just because something is constitutionally sound does not mean it is ethically the right decision.
1.5.6.5.1.2. Pro: A high court judge in the [United Kingdom](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/08/judge-rules-jehovahs-witness-boy-blood-transfusion) ruled that a young boy could receive a blood transfusion despite religious objections from his parents.
1.5.6.6. Con: -> See 1.5.6.2.1.2.2.2.1.2.2.
1.5.6.7. Con: HPV and other diseases are a public health issue, therefore they are beyond the personal sphere of individuals. A person's decision could affect others or society in general.
1.5.6.7.1. Con: This is a non sequitur fallacy. The suggestion that the right to informed consent may be violated does not follow from the premise that vaccination is "a public health issue". The fact that a person's decision could affect others in society does not suggest that therefore the person should not be allowed to exercise the right to choose. The risks and benefits must be weighed on an individual basis.
1.5.6.7.1.1. Con: By choosing not to vaccinate, the person infringes the rights of others not to catch a disease. Laws are designed to limit individual choices for the benefit of the public if said individual choices cause harm.
1.5.6.8. Con: From a utilitarian perspective, government could legitimately justify mandatory vaccination \(and trump an individual's right to choose\) in instances where the threat to public health and safety was sufficiently grave.
1.5.6.9. Pro: Voluntary uptake of the vaccine due to public-education campaigns is preferable to mandating it for those who are opposed to it. The benefits of vaccination are not urgent enough to take a coercive approach.
1.5.6.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.5.6.
