Discussion Title: Can Faith and Science Co-exist?

1. Faith and Science Can Co-exist
1.1. Con: Faith promotes unscientific thought.
1.1.1. Con: Some religious texts promote experimentation and scientific thought.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Whether or not we live up to it, seeking understanding and questioning things \(scientific discovery being one example\) is something that biblical Christianity encourages.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the Bible, God invites humans to put his promises to the test \([Malachi 3:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=malachi+3%3A10)\).
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the Christian religion we are told to be able to give a reason for our faith [\(1 Peter 3:15\)](http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm). To give a reason for faith one must examine the reasons they are faithful, and be able to present it logically.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: As long as there is no evidence of a God, science tells us that we should reject Christianity \(and other religions\), no matter what other merits they exhibit.
1.1.1.1.4. Pro: We are instructed to question what we are taught \([1 Thessalonians 5:21](https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm)\).
1.1.1.1.5. Con: This claim gets weaker when we consider historical actions by religious authorities in the past, like it is the case with [Giordano Bruno](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Giordano-Bruno) who spread his theory about the infinite Universe in the time of the "evangelization" of Europe and was burnt alive for it.
1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: It is inappropriate to judge a faith, much more all faiths, based on the actions of some who claim to follow a faith. Claiming to follow a faith does not necessitate you actually follow its teachings.
1.1.1.1.5.2. Con: The censorship of these religious authorities wasn't grounded in advice from the religious text itself \(i.e., where in the Bible does it say "thou shalt censor"?\), but on narcissism and fear of dissent. Power corrupts, whether or not one is religious.
1.1.2. Pro: Faith sometimes encourages the abdication of investigation by attributing physical phenomena to supernatural causes when a natural cause is yet unknown--the so-called "[God of the Gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps)".
1.1.2.1. Con: However unlikely, it seems plausible that one could prove supernatural causes for physical phenomena by illustrating the supernatural mechanism and providing examples of supernatural phenomena.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Intelligent Design is not a scientific hypothesis because it lacks an observable mechanic or plausible agency aside from the supernatural. The result is an argument from ignorance, the “God of the Gaps”.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Accusing intelligent design theorists of appealing to ignorance \(God of the gaps\) is [a common misconception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGqzCA1mnyM). ID theorists are operating on clear criteria that help them identify an observed and known mechanism for creating new things called free agency. Free agency is well established and understood by human experience.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Intelligent design is almost entirely motivated not by gaps in evolutionary theory but by the attempt to reconcile religious beliefs with evolutionary theory.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: There is at least one known [instance](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/atheists-for-intelligent-design/) of a self-identified atheist defending intelligent design as a hypothesis worth considering.
1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Intelligent design is supported almost exclusively by [theists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design#Religion_and_leading_proponents).
1.1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: If ID theory is in fact supported primarily by theists, this could just as easily indicate an institutional bias towards Neo-Darwinian evolution. This criticism can go both ways.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: There are other known institutional biases against whole fields of study such as eugenics. It's not unreasonable to suggest that there may be institutional bias against Intelligent Design.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Some institutional bias is arguably good. There is now what one could consider an institutional bias against the study of [eugenics](https://harvardmagazine.com/2016/03/harvards-eugenics-era), which resulted in the forced sterilization of 70,000 Americans.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3.3. Con: A bias based on theism would be difficult to prove as there are obviously proponents of natural selection who are self-identified theists as well as atheists.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Even if you accept the premise of irreducible complexity, the lack of mechanism to supplant natural selection does not imply intelligence. Thus, ID is an appeal from ignorance, "God of the Gaps".
1.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: ID theorists [explicate criteria](https://www.discovery.org/a/17905/) by which rational agents recognize or detect the effects of other rational agents, and distinguish them from the effects of natural causes. This is not an argument from ignorance.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Systems or sequences with the joint properties of “high complexity” \(or small probability\) and “specification” invariably result from intelligent causes, not chance or physical-chemical laws. These two criteria must be met in ID theory.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Complex sequences exhibit an irregular and improbable arrangement that defies expression by a simple rule or algorithm, whereas specification involves a match or correspondence between a physical system or sequence and an independently recognizable pattern or set of functional requirements.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: This is not physical evidence, but rhetorical logic. One could just as easily say that specification is an arbitrary measure resulting from cognitive bias. Which is to say that the fact that humans are able to "decode" DNA does not mean it must have been designed by an intelligent agent. We are also able to "decode" chemical composition by spectral analysis but it does not make chemical composition necessarily the result of intelligence.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: The ID theorist have identified neither a plausible agency nor a mechanic by which this intelligent design might occur, only an argument by analogy to human informational constructs.
1.1.2.2.1.3. Con: There is no known or speculated intelligent agent capable of manipulating genetics over the millenia required to mimic evolution, nor have ID theorists even speculated a mechanism to do so.
1.1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: You can infer signs of intelligence without knowing who the intelligent source is. Recognizing the activity of intelligent agents [constitutes a common and fully rational mode of inference](https://www.discovery.org/a/17905/).
1.1.2.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: SETI’s search for extraterrestrial intelligence [presupposes that information imbedded in electromagnetic signals](https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/seti-observations) from space would indicate an intelligent source.
1.1.2.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Archaeologists [assume that rational agents produced the inscriptions on the Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone).
1.1.2.2.1.3.1.3. Pro: Insurance fraud investigators [detect certain “cheating patterns”](https://gebhardtinsurancegroup.com/insurance-companies-detect-insurance-fraud/) that suggest intentional manipulation of circumstances rather than a natural disaster.
1.1.2.2.1.3.1.4. Pro: [Cryptographers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) distinguish between random signals and those carrying encoded messages, the latter indicating an intelligent source.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.1.
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.2.
1.1.2.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.3.
1.1.2.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.2.1.
1.1.2.2.6. Con: The parent assumes [methodological naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_\(philosophy\)#Methodological_naturalism) to be true which begs the question for this entire discussion. You cannot assume that supernatural hypotheses and theological propositions have no place in science. This is what must be proved.
1.1.3. Con: The fact that faith may hinder scientific inquiry does not stop faith and science from coexisting in spite of occasional conflict.
1.1.4. Pro: A faith-based hypothesis discourages alternate ideas and rejects plausible opposing ideas.
1.1.4.1. Con: “[Theology can provide explanations for certain scientific problems and data](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false). Some of these explanations involve the use of a primary causal act of God, and thus the use of personal agency \(e.g. in solving the problem of gaps in the fossil record by noting that they are to be expected due to God’s primary causal activity in creating discrete “kinds” of organisms\). J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.2. Con: “[Theology can provide and help solve external and internal conceptual problems](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) \(e.g. problems of overcoming the improbabilities of life originating by chance without a guiding intelligence\).” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.3. Con: “[Theology can provide propositions “from above” for guiding research](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) and, in keeping with the hypothetico-deductive method, can generate positive and negative test implications \(e.g. that evidence of human origins should be found in the Mideast, that models of the universe entailing an infinite past like certain big bang models will be falsified\).” Philosophers J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.4. Con: Theology can shed light on various issues in the confirmation of scientific hypotheses in at least four ways.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: “[Theology can provide rationally justified background beliefs against which rational assessment of a specific scientific theory can be made](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) \(e.g. given the belief that humans were created by a primary causal act of God, then various evidences for prehuman ancestral forms will carry less weight than they would without this background belief\);” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: “[Theology can yield positive and negative results that can be tested](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false)” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.4.3. Pro: “[Theology can recommend certain methodological rules over others](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) \(e.g. preferring explanations of living organisms on a substance model over those that treat them as machines and property-things when the two come into conflict\).” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: “[Theology can specify a certain ranking of epistemic virtues in certain cases](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) \(e.g. in origin of life research, preferring theories that solve external and internal conceptual problems theologically to theories that claim to offer avenues fruitful in guiding research for naturalistic mechanisms as to how life arose\).” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.5. Con: “[Theology can provide extrinsic goals for science](https://books.google.com/books?id=yTufCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA355&lpg=PA355&dq=Theology+can+provide+and+help+solve+external+and+internal+conceptual+problems&source=bl&ots=OQGMux8ETD&sig=2PEkbq3sj9WjV4yek1ffLDLmWdw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5aK_05LeAhXQxlkKHSfSDqYQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Theology%20can%20provide%20and%20help%20solve%20external%20and%20internal%20conceptual%20problems&f=false) \(e.g. to glorify God, to show that our Scriptures are not in conflict with what it is reasonable to believe from sources outside them\) and can help justify certain intrinsic goals for science” J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig
1.1.4.6. Pro: "Intelligent design" is a purposeful rejection of evolutionary theory despite overwhelming evidence of evolution, intended to support creationist arguments.
1.1.4.6.1. Con: Intelligent design is a natural outcome of [dissatisfaction with the evolutionary mechanism of natural selection](https://intelligentdesign.org/faq/). Its proponents still largely believe in the theory of evolution.
1.1.4.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.1.4.6.2. Con: Intelligent design is a rational and scientific discipline that deserves a seat at the table. It is rejected because of an [institutional bias towards neo-darwinianism.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mfylw5okAag)
1.1.4.6.2.1. Con: There are non-religious non-mainstream hypotheses such as the [Aquatic Ape Theory](http://johnhawks.net/weblog/topics/pseudoscience/aquatic_ape_theory.html) that are rejected for lack of evidence, among other things.
1.1.4.6.2.1.1. Con: Intelligent design is not a theological hypothesis. The findings from ID would certainly have implications for theological propositions; however, it is not itself a theological hypothesis.
1.1.4.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Intelligent design offers no potential natural explanations about how such intelligent design might occur, only the single supernatural one. It is a [teleological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleological_argument) for the existence of god, thus is a theological hypothesis.
1.1.4.7. Pro: [Young Earth creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism) claims the Earth and/or Universe is between 6000-10000 years old. This is a religious doctrine, but it is a claim about the physical world, and can be scientifically tested \(and indeed is commonly taken to have been falsified\).
1.1.4.7.1. Con: Religious texts that attempt to explain the physical world are rarely intended to be a definitive source of truth about the physical world.
1.1.4.7.1.1. Con: Religious texts were historically viewed as definitive sources of knowledge on the physical world, especially the Bible. Simply because some Christians have found ways to incorporate scientific understanding without conflict does not mean that it can be extrapolated further. Numerous Christians still believe in a literal teaching, for example.
1.1.4.7.1.2. Pro: The book of Genesis describes creation, but most Christians believe that it does this with the goal of describing God's plan for mankind from the beginning.
1.1.4.8. Pro: Despite the anthropological likelihood and probabability of Jesus being married, this idea is rejected outright by Christians as it does not match their canon.
1.1.4.8.1. Con: Christians often explore and consider evidence against their doctrines because they have a rational worldview. If there is sufficient evidence for a proposition that goes against a doctrine, appropriate action is nearly always taken \(e.g. the implications of the evidence for the doctrine are evaluated, the doctrine is revised to account for the evidence, etc.\). This is what the Christian theological discipline of apologetics is all about.
1.1.4.9. Pro: Original sin is a tenet of Christianity, but also an anthropological point of view which presupposes certain immutable human characteristics, opposing any different viewpoint.
1.1.4.9.1. Con: Just because original sin is a tenet of Christianity that opposes other viewpoints, it does not follow that the doctrine leads to no testable hypotheses.
1.1.4.9.1.1. Con: The testing of the original sin hypothesis would have to be done by other scientists because it opposes the faith of Christians.
1.1.5. Pro: The social and well organized nature of religion results in forming extremely strong lobby groups, which in turn start dictating what topics science can or cannot research.
1.1.6. Pro: The acceptance of certain ideas without \(at least eventual\) question is antithetical to the scientific process, and the proliferation of this faith-based thinking can stifle science.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Religion requires belief in certain absolute tenets or assumptions that cannot be questioned.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Moral values from religions stifle scientific inquiry.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Faith-based belief systems assign arbitrary values to certain things such as [cloning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_cloning), which discourages scientific inquiry regarding those things.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: Sometimes science needs to be stifled and put in check by moral thinking. For example: cloning humans to harvest body parts for the clone source. Not all hypotheses that are testable are worthy of testing.
1.1.6.2.2.1. Con: Ethics is studied independently of religion.
1.1.6.2.2.2. Con: While ethics influences the methodology of testing, it should not influence the nature of the hypothesis tested. I.e. experimenting on humans vs. experimenting on lab-grown cells.
1.1.6.2.2.2.1. Pro: The hypothesis that poison kills humans is medically valuable and does not need to be tested by poisoning a human.
1.1.6.2.2.3. Pro: While a scientific hypothesis is ethically evaluated separately from the method of experimentation, perhaps there are ideas which are simply too dangerous to even think about.
1.1.6.2.2.3.1. Pro: There are fields such as eugenics which are avoided almost completely due to ethical concerns.
1.1.6.2.3. Pro: Modern [Christianity](http://www.pewforum.org/2008/07/17/religious-groups-official-positions-on-stem-cell-research/) continues to stand in the way of embryonic stem cell research.
1.1.6.2.3.1. Con: This is one subject within science currently but does not discredit the past influence faith had on scientific endeavors.
1.1.6.2.3.1.1. Con: Religion claims to be eternal, so a contradiction presently invalidates the religion as a whole.
1.1.6.2.3.2. Con: Judeo-Christian values stand in the way of much research that is considered immoral, such as the [experiments of the Nazis](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005168). Values that affirm the inherent worth of human beings does not make intervention in scientific experiments that do not affirm the same thing wrong. Indeed, this is one very clear relationship where science and theology can help one another. Theology can establish a strong moral framework upon which to conduct science.
1.1.6.2.3.2.1. Con: Atheists are not unethical beings by nature, so religion as a moral framework is gratuitous and therefore a poor excuse for its existence.
1.1.6.2.3.2.2. Con: Theology has consistently been used to justify the persecution and genocide of people, from the [Jews in Germany](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-german-churches-and-the-nazi-state) to the Christians in Rome to [black people in the US](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/jim_crow_south_s_lynching_of_blacks_and_christianity_the_terror_inflicted.html) to ISIS in the Middle East. Religion has consistently been on the wrong side of humanitarian debate.
1.1.6.2.3.2.3. Con: Religion is an unverified moral framework, and thus using modern religion as a moral framework is equivalent to using the gods of ancient Greece to justify actions today, or any other framework that by nature is unverifiable.
1.1.6.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: Just because a moral framework meshes without current social standards for morality doesn't prove it as accurate or even right; it puts us in the "right things for the wrong reasons" category of moral justifications.
1.1.6.2.3.3. Con: Stem cell research involves the use of embryos. Based on prima facie evidence, these should be considered persons with full rights until proven otherwise. The burden of proof that these are not persons has not been met. Thus, Christians are justified in their stance against this research to the extent it mutilates and destroys human persons.
1.1.6.2.3.3.1. Con: Many religious people [support the death penalty](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/29/support-for-death-penalty-lowest-in-more-than-four-decades/). The hypocrisy of supporting the death penalty while not supporting abortion disqualifies religion as a justifiable moral framework.
1.1.6.2.3.3.1.1. Con: The parent is logically fallacious because it is a false comparison. It equates two moral scenarios where the factors under consideration are not the same.
1.1.6.3. Con: Many religions do not ask for blind faith, just as a scientist reaches a conclusion with facts, so too does a religious person through either experience or facts.
1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Faith and science are both based on evidence. "Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen." \([Heb 11:1](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm)\) "Evident demonstration" the original-language word for the phrase “assured expectation” means faith involves conviction that is based on evidence.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: "Assured expectation" translates the Greek word hypoʹstasis. This term is common in ancient papyrus business documents. The signatories were assured that all parties would get what they hoped for.
1.1.6.3.1.2. Pro: "Evident demonstration", [elegkhos](http://biblehub.com/greek/1650.htm). While not empirical evidence per se, not blind [faith](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200001484), either.
1.1.6.3.1.3. Pro: Science ideally also seeks truth. Scientists search for empirical evidence that might support a hypothesis. After firming up hypotheses, they form a theory. Then they test the theory by trying to prove it wrong. If it passes the tests, they have a theory.
1.1.6.3.1.4. Pro: A religious idea should also be tested. Christians should ask if their ideas find scriptural support. Not just advocating a doctrine, but digging deeper. Even if they show support from Scripture, they should be open to go deeper to see how other Scriptures support or not.
1.1.6.3.1.4.1. Con: Scripture is not evidence, as it cannot be objectively tested.
1.1.6.3.1.4.1.1. Con: Scripture, specifically the Bible, can be counted as evidence if it is approached from an appropriate worldview \(e.g. Christianity\). For Christians, scripture is evidence.
1.1.6.3.1.4.1.2. Con: One cannot ask a worldview to provide their definition of "faith" from their source and then reject it on the basis of a competing worldview that doesn't accept the evidence.
1.1.6.3.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Christianity uses scripture to define faith because they accept scripture as God's Word. One can attack the idea that scripture is in fact God's Word; however, it can't be argued that scripture, which provides the definition of what Christian faith is, is an inappropriate source to describe Christian faith for Christians.
1.1.6.3.1.4.1.3. Pro: Scriptural support is subjective, as interpretations of holy texts vary from one religious belief to the other. As such, it cannot be treated in any way similar to scientific evidence.
1.1.6.3.1.5. Pro: Faith does not mean blind faith. It basically means accepting a possible explanation for existing evidence and acting under the assumption that the explanation is true until it is clearly contradicted by other evidence.
1.1.6.3.1.5.1. Pro: Religion can be considered a falsifiable hypothesis, and as such it can be falsified.
1.1.6.3.1.6. Con: Faith only accepts evidence if it suits the doctrine.
1.1.6.3.1.6.1. Pro: Most religions believe in some kind of apocalypse, while the most probable scientific projections state that this [will never happen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future).
1.1.6.4. Con: Immanuel Kant's work on "the thing in itself" demands us to address the difference between our ontological models and the underlying reality \(be that a causal reality or some other unknowable relationship\). At their root, scientific models of the Universe may always eventually fall back on human faculties like common sense, which are not easily distinguished from acts of faith.
1.1.6.4.1. Con: Suppose that current scientific ontological models are often hypothetical at this point. That does not imply faith in those scientific ontological models, only gaps in knowledge.
1.1.6.5. Con: Faith is the acceptance of truth without the use of the scientific method, repeated testing and outside verification, but not without question.
1.1.6.5.1. Con: Nearly all faith with religious context has dogma.
1.1.6.5.1.1. Pro: Lutheran sect of Christianity has the dogma of the Apostle's creed.
1.1.6.5.1.2. Pro: Most Christian churches require that members "believe in Jesus Christ", though many won't deny membership.
1.1.6.5.1.3. Con: Zen Buddhism has no discernible dogma. While many believe in reincarnation or karma, neither is a required belief.
1.1.6.6. Con: Faith can sometimes be a motivation to 'do science'. A study of the history of science reveals the [religious motivations](https://theconversation.com/religion-isnt-the-enemy-of-science-its-been-inspiring-scientists-for-centuries-90190) behind some prominent scientists such as Isaac Newton.
1.1.6.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.1.6.7. Con: Science also has ideas that are no longer questioned, such as evolution. Some supporters of evolution are very dogmatic in their approach.
1.1.6.7.1. Con: While there are established theories that are not questioned by non-experts generally, they are still in theory falsifiable. This includes evolution, which while difficult to experiment with is also falsifiable.
1.1.6.7.2. Con: In some states such as Alabama, Georgia, and Kansas, evolution is \(or was\) [taught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_and_evolution_in_public_education_in_the_United_States) as a soft "theory" which is intended to challenge the scientific view that it is actually scientific fact.
1.1.6.7.3. Con: Many who oppose evolution are dogmatic in their approach. Instead of making constructive discourse, leaders in the religious community have mockingly invented intelligent design without any regard to presenting objective data. The Bible has no discussion on intelligent design.
1.1.6.7.3.1. Con: Design can be discerned by examining the [evidence](https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/science/was-it-designed/#?insight\[search_id\]=83cbc383-48a0-4221-b938-8561b5532ce1&insight\[search_result_index\]=0). Dogmatic arguments are very unfortunate in failing to do this.
1.1.6.7.3.2. Con: 'The Bible has no discussion on intelligent design,' it just affirms that God created all life. Intelligent design can be observed scientifically though. Observation is what scientists do. For example, [DNA](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201312/storage-capacity-of-dna/).
1.1.7. Con: This is true of only a shrinking subset of definitions of "faith". The meaning of faith in our discourse is in flux, and bending towards compatibility with scientific thought.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Historically the application of religious faith has changed in response to modern issues such as abortion, premarital sex and polygamy, to name a few things that were not historically considered significant enough to address before the last few centuries.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Certain canon of the church have been dropped in response to science, such as with Galileo who is no longer considered heretical.
1.1.7.3. Con: Just as larger church organizations may lean toward scientific tolerance, other religious sects are leaning toward fundamentalist literal interpretations of holy texts.
1.1.8. Con: Faith is only unscientific if it is valued above scientific approaches in situations that science has a better framework for exploring.
1.1.8.1. Con: Faith is always unscientific, as the very term "faith" implies belief in something for which there is no evidence.
1.1.8.2. Con: Religion has no place for other frameworks by its threat of eternal suffering to the non-devout; as a result, using science instead is to fail one's religious obligations.
1.1.9. Con: Dogmas contain unscientific thoughts. Not faith. Scientists can believe in aliens, god\(s\), and other ethereal hyper-dimensional entities to have created the universe.
1.1.10. Pro: Many religious faiths directly contradict scientific facts.
1.1.10.1. Con: Most religious beliefs regarding historical supernatural events cannot practically be disproved by science as they generally lack enough specificity in material evidence to be falsifiable. There is no DNA to compare, no body of Jesus.
1.1.10.2. Pro: While not itself a religious tenet, the Old Testament claim of a worldwide flood [contradicts](https://www.csicop.org/si/show/twenty-one_reasons_noahs_worldwide_flood_never_happened) scientific fact.
1.1.10.3. Pro: Miracles such as Sarah giving birth at 90, Jesus being born of a virgin and Jesus/Lazarus rising from the dead are scientifically impossible, which produces conflict.
1.1.10.3.1. Pro: The Bible also records the incredulity of these events to demonstrate this conflict \(Abraham questioned Sarah's conceivability, and Joseph thought Mary had been unfaithful. Lazarus was considered dead and Jesus' disciples deserted their Lord and hid not believing he was resurrected.\)
1.1.10.3.2. Pro: Miraculous events by virtue of being against conventional science only make sense if metaphysical influence is possible, otherwise conflict occurs.
1.1.10.4. Con: Science by itself has contradictions and [disagrees](https://physics.aps.org/story/v16/st10) on some points.
1.1.10.4.1. Con: If science has contradictions or disagreements, it is considered to be incomplete or inconclusive and requires further evidence. In contrast, religious dogmas such as the virgin birth of Jesus Christ cannot be questioned. These situations are not comparable.
1.1.10.5. Pro: For instance, Christianity is founded on the belief in resurrection of Jesus Christ, while very long term observation of human mortality is evidence that resurrection is impossible.
1.1.10.5.1. Pro: There is no documented case of resurrection in entire human population.
1.1.10.5.1.1. Con: The central facts explained by the resurrection of Jesus hypothesis enjoy [multiple, early, independent attestation](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/question-answer/P580/independent-sources-for-jesus-burial-and-empty-tomb).
1.1.10.5.1.1.1. Pro: The gospel accounts are [historically credible](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/jesus-of-nazareth/the-evidence-for-jesus/).
1.1.10.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The gospel accounts, just like other historical documents, [bear no special burden of proof](https://www.kialo.com/god-exists-3491/3491.0=3491.1+3491.619+3491.1169). There are good reasons to think the gospels are reliable until proven wrong.
1.1.10.5.1.1.2. Con: The gospel accounts are [not historically credible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_reliability_of_the_Gospels).
1.1.10.5.1.1.2.1. Con: The gospel accounts have not been significantly modified or corrupted from the original source documents.
1.1.10.5.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: A quantitative study on the stability of the New Testament compared early manuscripts to later manuscripts, up to the Middle Ages, with the Byzantine manuscripts, and concluded that the text [had more than 90% stability over this time period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_reliability_of_the_Gospels).
1.1.10.5.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: It has been estimated that only [0.1% to 0.2% of the New Testament variants impact the meaning of the texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_reliability_of_the_Gospels) in any significant fashion.
1.1.10.5.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.5.1.1.1.1.
1.1.10.5.1.2. Pro: It is extremely doubtful that witnesses earlier than the 20th century had the medical knowledge or technology to determine or record clinical brain death, thus there is little historical distinction between resuscitation and resurrection.
1.1.10.5.1.2.1. Con: The lack of ability to historically distinguish between resuscitation and resurrection makes it possible that there are unconfirmed cases of resurrection.
1.1.10.5.1.3. Pro: The only evidence we have of the resurrection is the testimony of the disciples--likely written several decades later. The other evidence does not exist except in their testimony.
1.1.10.5.2. Pro: There is no biological or physical mechanism that would allow resurrection to ever happen.
1.1.10.5.2.1. Con: Strawman Fallacy - The resurrection hypothesis does not argue that a biological or physical mechanism is responsible for raising Jesus from the dead. Rather it is the hypothesis that God raised Jesus from the dead.
1.1.10.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.10.5.1.2.1.
1.1.10.5.4. Con: This claim is susceptible to the [problem of induction](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/). Long-term observation of human mortality is evidence that resurrection is perhaps improbable or extremely rare, but not that it is impossible per se.
1.1.10.5.4.1. Con: In this sense we are unable to make any judgement.
1.1.10.5.4.2. Pro: For Christianity, resurrection is only possible through divine intervention, which explains its rarity.
1.1.10.6. Pro: The [creation narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative) in the Old Testament contradicts the [scientific account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) of how the universe came into existence.
1.1.10.6.1. Con: The standard model is actually evidence for a beginning of the universe which is perfectly consistent with [creatio ex nihilo](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/creation-ex-nihilo-theology-and-science/). The Big Bang model reinforces the creation narrative found in the Bible. It does not detract from it.
1.1.10.6.2. Con: The creation story can be seen as allegorical rather than literal.
1.1.10.6.2.1. Pro: The book of Genesis is poetic description for the beginning of the universe, and not a scientific essay. This was even obvious in the 2nd century AD \(see what [Origen](http://henrycenter.tiu.edu/2017/04/origen-decoding-genesis/) wrote about it\).
1.1.10.6.3. Pro: If the Book of Genesis is interpreted literally, its account of the creation of the Universe is irreconcilable with scientific findings.
1.1.10.6.3.1. Pro: The creation of the Universe in seven days is irreconcilable with scientific findings.
1.1.10.6.3.1.1. Con: There is evidence [the Earth is young](https://creationtoday.org/evidence-for-a-young-earth/).
1.1.10.6.3.1.1.1. Con: The overall age of the Earth is not relevant to the creation story per se but the subsequent biblical narrative.
1.1.10.6.3.1.1.2. Con: To be credible science, the young Earth theory must also provide a superior explanation for fossil, geological and radiometric data--data that currently contradicts the young Earth hypothesis.
1.1.10.6.3.1.2. Pro: The fossil records, geological and radiometric data attest to millions of years between evolutionary steps, likely more than [2000 million years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_evolution) between the earliest one-celled life and modern human beings.
1.1.10.6.3.2. Con: Young Earth creationism is increasingly a minority view among Christian theologians which is evidence that they are open to changing their ideas based on presented scientific evidence.
1.1.10.6.3.2.1. Pro: Most Americans believe that God had a role in creating human beings, whether in their present form or as part of an evolutionary process over millions of years. [But fewer Americans today hold strict creationist views of the origins of humans than at any point in Gallup's trend on the question](https://news.gallup.com/poll/210956/belief-creationist-view-humans-new-low.aspx), and it is no longer the single most popular of the three explanations.
1.1.10.6.3.3. Con: There are upwards of [twelve valid interpretations](http://www.pcahistory.org/creation/report.pdf) of Genesis 1 and 2. Many of these would be consistent with the findings of modern science, even the theory of evolution.
1.1.10.6.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.10.6.2.1.
1.1.10.6.3.5. Con: The narrative in Genesis describes life coming into existence in the water and air, before life on land, and man - consistent with evolutionary branching.
1.1.10.6.3.5.1. Con: The order described in the claim is not the order described in NIV Genesis. The first life God creates is land vegetation—seed-bearing plants and trees with fruit. \([Genesis 1:12](https://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/1.html)\)
1.1.10.6.4. Con: Conflicts relating to the time scales implied in creation \(universe age as several billions of years vs. seemingly 6500 years based on creation\) could potentially be resolved if creation is considered to be a fixed point \(like the Big Bang\) where objects were placed.
1.1.10.6.4.1. Pro: What we see of far space in a fixed timeframe would appear to have been there from billions of years ago, similar to how what we see of the sun is over 8 minutes in the past since the light takes time to travel to our eyes.
1.1.10.6.5. Con: According to [Pope Francis](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-declares-evolution-and-big-bang-theory-are-right-and-god-isnt-a-magician-with-a-magic-9822514.html), the Big Bang theory does not conflict with the Catholic concept of creation and intervention of the divine creator.
1.1.11. Con: Faith provides a foundation for scientific thought.
1.1.11.1. Pro: Studying the universe \(i.e. doing science\) is an exercise of worship of God.
1.1.11.1.1. Pro: Appreciating the complexity of a master's handiwork is a good thing to do.
1.1.11.1.2. Con: Many scientists use their faith as motivation to learn and explore. But this claim is not all-encompassing, as there are many scientists that explore ideas due to pure curiosity and not as an act on faith.
1.1.11.2. Pro: If there is a God, then there is a good reason to believe that scientific investigation provides a truthful account of empirical reality.
1.1.11.2.1. Con: The existence of a supreme being doesn't give us an additional reason to trust our results but rather a reason to doubt them as there is a huge variable that simply cannot be accounted for experimentally.
1.1.11.2.2. Pro: [Descartes believed](https://u.osu.edu/freewill/descartes-2/descartes-on-human-error/) that a benevolent God would not deceive us about the content of the external world.
1.1.11.3. Pro: Faith is the impetus for scientific thought. It is in essence an affront, a challenge to migrate faith to fact and reset a new belief.
1.1.11.3.1. Con: Investigating faith-based material claims is of little scientific value to those neutral to such claims and only draws scientists into pointless arguments.
1.1.12. Con: -> See 1.1.11.3.
1.2. Pro: All of science relies on faith to some extent.
1.2.1. Pro: There is more information available then anyone would ever be able to learn, consume, obtain or even see/hear/feel/taste in a lifetime. A scientist \(or anyone\) will have to trust at least some other people in order to come to any conclusion that relies on something else.
1.2.1.1. Con: Scientists come to conclusions based on reproducible experimental data, not from just trusting someone else. The [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) is what scientists trust.
1.2.2. Pro: Faith motivates science.
1.2.2.1. Con: The only thing science must rely on is the accuracy of the experiments testing the hypothesis. Its driving power is human curiosity and not faith.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Einstein seemed to be aware that faith can help us acknowledge our imperfections for understanding reality, and can keep the wonder and thus the scientific passion.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Argumentum ad verecundiam \(appeal to authority\). Basing on a claim of authority that \(almost\) no one is eager to challenge is defeasible \(not essential\) argument and a fallacy.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: This claim is invalid if we just accept our imperfection in understanding reality. Religion is an unneeded middleman.
1.2.2.2.3. Con: This is support for religion as a path to scientific passion and wonder, and is irrelevant to whether science relies on faith unless claiming religion is the sole provider of scientific passion and that this is needed for science.
1.2.2.3. Pro: To desire to prove something you have to believe it is possible. Hence, having faith in its potential existence is what inspires this action.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Faith is the fuel of wonder, wonder is the fuel of science.
1.2.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.6.
1.2.3. Pro: Faith does not imply religious faith exclusively. Faith is merely the acceptance of a proposition without verification \(or with faulty verification\).
1.2.3.1. Con: In science, certain things must be assumed in order for research to be possible. This is not faith, just as it is not 'faith' to use scaffolding to work on a building. The scaffolding \(assumptions\) is not part of the final work \(science\). It is merely a tool. You are conflating tools and faith.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: If the underlying assumptions of science aren’t taken on faith \(believed in/trusted\), then there can be no scientific truths at all. If the foundation of science itself isn’t even believed in, then accepting scientific truths is worse than accepting truths on faith! It is all built on an illusion.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: In science it is believed that something is true due to no better possibility - no better hypothesis; not the fact that it was proven 100% true. Faith is used not only as a tool for beginning assumption - even final statements are in fact only believed to be true \(with high probability\).
1.2.3.1.3. Con: The full extent of the applicability of the analogy becomes apparent as the project approaches completion. For the builder, the success criterion will be to remove all traces of the scaffolding, whereas a researcher will never delete his bibliography and footnotes towards impressing the scientific community.
1.2.3.1.4. Con: An assumption is never more than an expression of faith.
1.2.3.1.4.1. Con: Faith is a complete trust and confidence in something. An assumption is by definition something uncertain and here to be either proven or disproved.
1.2.3.1.5. Pro: Scientific assumptions function either to be tested or as something widely accepted by the scientific community. Scientific assumptions are not taken lightly. It's like how we assume x+\(y+z\) = \(x+y\)+z, the assumptions are well defined unless it is the assumption being tested.
1.2.3.2. Con: Faith with religion vs. faith without religion have vastly different connotations and therefore cannot be meaningfully compared.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Every time an atheist tells his boss "I'll be there at 7:00 am tomorrow", he exercises faith. He sets his alarm clock, believing it will wake him up, even though power outages, break-ins, death, etc. are real. He gets in his car using faith to believe he will arrive despite knowing empirically there will be wrecks on the freeway, he just has faith it won't be him. Life is impossible without faith. It is called "intelligent faith".
1.2.3.3.1. Con: He believes this due to tangible observations and data, religion requires faith with limited evidence.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: This is the distinction between evidence-based faith and blind faith.
1.2.3.4. Pro: Before the introduction of Einstein's Theory of Relativity, Newtonian Mechanics were generally accepted by the scientific community. This general acceptance is evidence of a kind of faith because it represents holding a belief about the laws of physics without access to missing information.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: Newton's theory was accepted only because all experimental observations within the accuracy of its time period were confirming it. Only when the ability to measure time with much higher accuracy was available, scientists could detect the mistakes in Newton's theory. This is not faith but at best pragmatism which accepts the limitations in our measurements to enable technological use of good enough science.
1.2.3.4.2. Pro: The extended expression of faith is based on the principle of '[standing on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)', extrapolated by Popper to form the concept of [Evolutionary Epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_epistemology#Process_of_discovering_new_abstract_entities). According to Popper, we acquire knowledge incrementally, in small \(conservative\) building blocks, and always by drawing for our base on the achievements of the previous scientific generation.
1.2.3.4.2.1. Con: Relying on the works of previous scientists does not constitute faith, it is better understood as trust. Whereas faith is blind, trust is based on some established criteria and principles.
1.2.3.4.2.2. Pro: The accumulation of knowledge may be visualised as an upside-down pyramid, and it follows that the Newtonian pyramid was huge - containing the works of thousands of physicists, stratified into scores of scientific generations - by virtue of the centrality of Newton's topic, as well as the duration of his paradigm's lifespan.
1.2.3.4.2.2.1. Pro: All of these scientists up the pyramid accepted that the Newtonian Laws held true, and the vast bulk of them would not even have given the matter any thought.
1.2.3.4.3. Con: A scientific theory is primarily about making predictions. The predictions of Newtonian mechanics are usually sufficient when the velocities involved are below the speed of light. Recognising this does not resemble faith as it is testable in experiment.
1.2.3.4.3.1. Pro: Every scientific model is wrong but some models are useful. Models are ways of approximating reality through a description that can be used to make predictions about reality. If the predictions describe reality sufficiently well for our purposes \(e.g. to within margin of error of experimental measurements\), the model is a useful one.
1.2.3.4.4. Con: Science is not "just accepted." Theories undergo rigorous scrutiny and testing. Scientists spend decades learning the methodology of disproving and proving theories so that they don't "just accept" ideas. This directly contradicts any reasonable definition of "faith".
1.2.4. Con: Faith is defined as either "confidence or trust", or as "belief not based on evidence". While the former is a tool of science, the latter is not. When one's confidence in a theory is independent of the evidence for it, one is not being scientific or empirical.
1.2.5. Pro: The scientific method itself must be taken on faith, because its validity relies on several fundamental ideas about the nature of reality \(like Nature's consistency over time, or its ability to be described by mathematics\), that cannot be justified scientifically. Even if such ideas seem obvious, their truth is far from logical necessity, but must be accepted "on faith".
1.2.5.1. Con: It is true that science functions according to certain assumptions. However, those assumptions are challengeable, which distinguishes them from faith. Such examples include the Copernican revolution, the refutation of mass and time as universal constants in the relativistic \(Einsteinian\) revolution.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: No science is ever "settled".
1.2.5.1.2. Con: Not all assumptions can be challenged in this way. For example, the idea that the laws of nature will not change over time is a necessary condition for the scientific method's validity, and so cannot be verified or challenged on scientific grounds. Challenging it would undercut the very evidence used to challenge it.
1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: It seems likely that if the laws of nature did change, scientific practice would change alongside it. Conversely, there is no guarantee that religious and other faith-based practices would change as well.
1.2.5.2. Con: The amount of faith required for science to function is limited to an insignificant margin.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: There are [few assumptions](http://www.indiana.edu/~ensiweb/NOS%20Over.BasicAssump.html) that are made to enable science, but these assumptions are made by anybody who believes that the world exists as they perceive it \(more or less\) and believe that it is possible to learn about the universe that surrounds them.
1.2.5.2.2. Con: How commonplace or generally accepted an idea is doesn't make it more or less significant of an assumption. If it is not supportable by evidence even in principle, then it can only be accepted "on faith".
1.2.5.3. Con: Scientific method is about verification. Scientific theories change and evolve when new verified evidence arises. Religion does not verify their claims basing on hard evidence.
1.2.5.3.1. Con: The challenge is: science cannot verify itself. It must presuppose logic, math, and that our physical senses really do give us accurate information about reality. The very words, "the scientific method is about verification" cannot be verified by science. Thus, any epistemology built on verification alone is ultimately self-defeating.
1.2.5.4. Pro: Hume's [problem of induction](https://stanford.library.sydney.edu.au/archives/sum2016/entries/induction-problem/) shows that we can never justifiably believe that nature will behave according to consistent laws.
1.2.5.4.1. Con: This is why science maintains theories. Gravity is still a theory, but because we can't be 100% certain that doesn't mean science and therefore evidence based assertions are equivalent to evidence-less assertions like religion.
1.2.5.4.2. Con: Hume proposes this, but statistics are also an integral part of this. In the link provided, the article later goes on to discuss Bayesian statistics, which helps us accept the possibility that we can't know yet we can safely assume.
1.2.5.4.3. Con: The wide use \(and accepted use\) of science and its applications are evidence to the fact that we have justified our assumptions as much as we need to in order to use them.
1.2.5.4.4. Con: Claiming we can never justify scientific claims results in two results. Either science is futile since we can't know, or we must proceed with everything theoretical even when we have proof, which is the way science currently functions. This argument is therefore purposeless.
1.2.5.5. Pro: Mathematics is fundamental to science, yet mathematics often relies on faith.
1.2.5.5.1. Con: While mathematics can reliably describe real things, it is itself an intellectual construct and language. It is arguably a modeling technology in some respects. One does not have "faith" in mathematics per se, as one must constantly check the reliability of the model. The map is not the terrain.
1.2.5.5.2. Pro: In mathematics systems of axioms exist which are not proven and are just ”believed” to be true. “Faith” and “science” co-exist in this case.
1.2.5.5.2.1. Con: Mathematics is only a language and as per se it is abstract.
1.2.5.5.2.2. Con: Mathematical and religious axioms are very different. In mathematics axioms are self-evident. In religion axioms are statements taken with no evidence.
1.2.5.5.2.2.1. Con: Many mathematical axioms are far from self-evident. Consider, for example, the [axiom of infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity), which states that a set containing infinite elements exists. The existence of any infinite entity is certainly not self-evident.
1.2.5.5.2.3. Con: Those axioms, upon being proven false, will no longer realistically be considered as axioms.
1.2.5.5.2.3.1. Con: Scientists have been able to stimulate an egg in the laboratory to reproduce without fertilization.
1.2.5.5.2.3.2. Con: Axioms cannot be "proven false". Mathematical theorems and results can be proven false, but axioms cannot.
1.2.5.5.3. Pro: As Kurt Gödel has shown, formalization of arithmetic based on a final set of axioms so that any true theorem of arithmetic can be formally proven is not possible. This may be interpreted so that we have to "believe" that the language of arithmetic and models built in it are formal enough without having any formal proof of it. [What is Godel's Theorem? \(Scientific American\)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-godels-theorem/) So even such a precise science as arithmetic is based on faith to a certain extent.
1.2.5.5.4. Con: Mathematics is one of the least faith-dependent subjects. Everything is either proven or not; no gray areas exist.
1.2.5.6. Con: This equates consistent observations with the lack of observations. Statistics exists not to prove things, but to say it is safe to assume these things because of their consistency. Statistics gives us the ability to not be 100% certain yet still rank ideas based on the likelihood of their truth.
1.2.5.6.1. Pro: If we were to rank ideas based on their likelihood, faith would rank at the bottom, while science would rank at the top \(while the theories would not all be the same, they would be above religious faith\).
1.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.
1.2.7. Con: The process of acquiring scientific knowledge involves the use of question \(doubt\) and observation and is incompatible with the notion of accepting information by faith.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Science does not "make claims" but assesses the claims for whether they are true or not. Science is the way for finding out the truth, while religions make claims that they are the truth. \(Religious\) Faith is the wilful belief in religious claims that disregards facts by suspending one's ability for critical thought.
1.2.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.1.
1.2.8. Con: 'Science' consists of a system of falsifiable hypotheses, positive evidence for which is rarely available. Once falsified, a hypothesis is replaced with a new one exposed to further testing. The strongest hypotheses are called 'theories'. There's no absolute certainty in science, but there's no blind faith either.
1.2.8.1. Con: Faith is not necessarily blind.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: [1 Thess. 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A1-11&version=NIV) states: "But examine everything thoroughly; hold fast to what is good".
1.2.8.1.2. Pro: [1 Corinthian 15:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A6&version=NIV), part of creed often considered by biblical scholars to be the earliest Christian message goes: "After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep." This implies an encouragement to talk to some of the 500 people who were still around for evidence.
1.2.9. Con: 'Faith' is not a word used in scientific circles: 'trust', 'likelihood' and 'probability' are common terms in science, but all of these terms are applied proportionally to the term's supporting evidence.
1.2.9.1. Pro: 'Religious faith' describes personal beliefs and opinions. Scientific description of the word 'faith' is based on reproductibility and prediction accuracy.
1.2.9.2. Con: Faith is needed to look at the essential points of science. Believing in theorems and axioms is the basis of most parts of science, as well as a kind of faith.
1.2.9.3. Con: According to [thesaurus.com](https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/faith/7?s=t), faith and trust are synonyms.
1.2.9.4. Con: Scientists have faith in causality. "Everything has a cause." is an unverifiable faith statement if one can't observe all events in history.
1.2.9.4.1. Con: This is not true for science. Science functions with a null hypothesis that nothing is causing this, and only when a degree of certainty is achieved do we declare the null hypothesis wrong.
1.2.9.4.1.1. Pro: Faith in causality is required for scientists to design and execute an experiment, but science assumes the opposite. This is why scientists have to prove things before being accepted in the scientific community.
1.2.10. Con: There is a strong difference between believing in something that is probable \(scientific approach\), and something that is false or unfalsifiable \(religious approach\).
1.2.10.1. Con: A higher power or intelligent designer is not an improbable being.
1.2.10.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #2629: [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism) exists.
1.2.11. Pro: Science leaves too many gaps for it to function alone.
1.2.11.1. Pro: Science can give no explanation of the cause of the laws of physics, beyond that they are simply how particles behave.
1.2.11.1.1. Pro: It is too statistically unlikely for the laws of physics to have by chance created the order one can observe exists in the world. A basic principle of entropy is that there are more ways for a system to be in disorder than in order.
1.2.11.1.1.1. Con: Shortcomings of physics fail to justify current religious frameworks.
1.2.11.1.1.1.1. Pro: Each religion is a statistically unlikely occurrence since we have no way to determine which religion would be correct.
1.2.11.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #3371: What [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) should people follow?
1.2.11.1.1.2. Con: To claim that this system of laws is statistically unlikely is a statement about the population of all "laws of physics." We only have our system as data, so claiming it's statistically unlikely is an inaccurate assessment given an insufficient population of data.
1.2.11.1.2. Con: This statement presupposes that there is a reason for the system as opposed to random chance. Science needn't presuppose a particular cause, as random chance is sufficient.
1.2.11.2. Con: Science is a continuous process. Saying science has too many gaps is only a valid claim if science is done progressing, which it isn't. Current gaps could just be things yet to be solved.
1.3. Pro: Faith and science address inherently different subject matter and can therefore co-exist.
1.3.1. Con: Human nature inherently pits conflicting ideologies and opposing beliefs against each other.
1.3.1.1. Pro: It is within human nature to blame everyone else but themselves, as such, both sides could never coexist because of one factor needed for proper coexistence: Compromise.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Even different religions have problems coexisting even though they are universally based upon "faith" and "belief", so a scientific line of thinking based on logic without weighing "belief" is inherently going to cause strife.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: The parent falsely accuses all religions of being unreasonable.
1.3.1.2.2. Con: Not all forms of theism define faith as “blind” or unwarranted assertion.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: The Christian view of “faith” includes the use of reason as part of an intellectual pursuit of discovering who God is, the world He created, and the underlying reasons for having faith.
1.3.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The ancient daily Jewish prayer called the Shema says to love the Lord with all of the heart. The ancient Jewish understanding of the [heart](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=aS4iM6KpPYo) was that it was the center of intellectual activity in a person. Thus, scripture commands humans to love God with their intellectual capabilities every day.
1.3.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: From cover to cover, the Bible consistently demonstrates the use of intellect, including study of the world itself.
1.3.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: In [Matthew 22:37](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=Matthew%2b22:37&version=NIV&interface=amp), Jesus himself commands his followers to “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.”
1.3.1.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: In [2 Timothy 3:16](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=2%2bTimothy%2b3:16&version=NIV&interface=amp), the apostle Paul tells Timothy “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.” The use of Scripture requires rational thought.
1.3.1.2.2.1.2.3. Pro: In [1 Peter 3:15](https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm), the Apostle Peter teaches Christians to “honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect.” Giving reasons for why we believe what we believe requires rational thought.
1.3.1.2.2.1.2.4. Pro: In relation to teaching other disciples in the faith, Paul instructs Timothy in [1 Timothy 4:15](https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-15.htm) to “Practice these things, immerse yourself in them, so that all may see your progress.” This clearly requires the use of rationality and intellect.
1.3.1.2.2.1.2.5. Pro: Across the book of Acts, the historian Luke gives an account of how the Apostles shared the gospel of Christ. Arguing \(reasoning\) and offering proofs were a standard component of sharing Jesus’ message.
1.3.1.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.10.
1.3.2. Pro: There are some religious faiths that have either no dogma or no dogma containing physical claims about the universe or history.
1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.3.
1.3.3. Pro: As long as they do not lead to contradictory claims, there is no reason that they can't coexist.
1.3.3.1. Con: Every single major religion uses texts rife with unscientific claims and promotes practices to bring about a certain outcome which has been proven to be false or is unprovable.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: There is extremely-little-to-no archaeological evidence to support the events described in the Book of Mormon, such as [the existence of horses](https://publications.mi.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1055&index=1) in Pre-Colombian America.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Horses have been found in Mexico that have been carbon dated to 2,540 years ago. See Miller and Roper, “[Animals in the Book of Mormon,](https://bookofmormoncentral.org/blog/new-evidence-for-horses-in-america)” Pg 164
1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This information lacks a credible, peer-reviewed source. That fact alone may act as an illustration of religious faith categorically operating against the principles of modern science, which centralize peer-reviewed, rigorous research.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Certain Hindu-based yogi practices encourage the drinking of "subtle liquors" from [one's own nose](https://www.womenfitness.net/jalneti-cleaning-nasal-path/), otherwise known as snot, for personal benefit. Some even promote cutting the frenulum to do so. There is no evidence that this is beneficial.
1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: It may be that these practices rely on anecdotal precedents, but that alone does not make them distinctly incompatible with scientific thought. Modern medicine and science often come to embrace observations from the Vedic traditions, after applying the scientific method to them.
1.3.3.1.3. Con: When mindfully separated from poetic and apocalyptic passages, the historical texts in the Bible tend to be surprisingly accurate.
1.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: While dates and even central details may be wildly inaccurate, we may find historical facts and valuable observations embedded throughout these texts.
1.3.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: Science provides tangible evidence for what the Bible and other religious texts have already considered as true. Therefore, they can both co-exist.
1.3.3.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Before science knew oxygen was carried by the blood: [Lev. 17:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+17%3A11&version=KJV) 'For the life of the flesh is in the blood.' The Bible did not dispute science, but confirmed it, before science confirmed it.
1.3.3.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: The Bible claimed pure gold was clear before NASA actually refined it and proved it: [Revelation 21:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A18-21&version=NIV) And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. The Bible confirmed this before science confirmed this.
1.3.3.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Before science, the Bible knew each star was different: [1 Corinthians 15:41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A41&version=KJV) 'There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.' The Bible confirmed this before science confirmed it.
1.3.3.1.3.1.1.4. Pro: Some biblical affirmations have been confirmed by science. For example, science has proved that all humans came from a single woman - Eve - by [mitochondrial studies.](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/resources/clarifications/MitochondrialEve.html) Thus, faith can offer guidelines for understanding the universe.
1.3.3.1.3.1.1.4.1. Con: The matrilineal most recent common ancestor \(called "Mitochondrial Eve" for scientific communications purpose\) was not the first human female and has nothing to do with the biblical Eve.
1.3.3.1.3.2. Con: This statement is equivalent to: "Except for all the points where it is wrong, the text is accurate."
1.3.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.6.3.
1.3.3.2. Pro: The Bible is not a book about science, although it does make some profound scientific claims that once challenged scientific orthodoxy.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Faith and scientific unity over the claim that time and space have a beginning suggests an area where they can co-exist. What the Bible always claimed challenged the once-held scientific orthodoxy that time and space were eternal.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: This was not an "orthodoxy" but a consensus based on an extrapolation of the available data. As soon as new phenomena were proved to exist - namely the [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) effect - the idea was rapidly abandoned by the whole community.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: If there is a scientific orthodoxy, then it is upholding the scientific method. Which in particular implies: if facts significantly contradict the standing and commonly accepted theory, the theory is to be abandoned by the whole scientific community.
1.3.3.3. Con: Well that's quite the problem. They sometimes do lead to contradictory claims.
1.3.3.4. Pro: Not all scientific findings and methods conflict with religion in the same way that not all religious knowledge conflicts with science.
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.3.1.1.
1.3.3.5. Pro: It is impossible to scientifically prove everything we believe, so everyone relies on faith to some degree.
1.3.3.5.1. Pro: Works like C.S. Lewis's [Mere Christianity](https://novel12.com/242826/mere-christianity.htm) demonstrate that some religious people are using the evidence available to them, and logic, to answer the question "Is there a God?" Using the best logic and evidence available seems the most scientific way to approach questions with answers that cannot be proven or disproven.
1.3.3.5.2. Pro: It is impossible to prove scientifically that a world exists external to our minds, yet most of us believe that this is true.
1.3.3.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.10.
1.3.3.5.4. Pro: We can't understand all the complexity of the universe in our limited human understanding.
1.3.3.6. Pro: There is nothing inherently contradictory between intelligent design and evolution. Adaptability is an intelligent design choice.
1.3.3.6.1. Con: There is nothing inherently supporting the claim either.
1.3.3.6.2. Con: If this is true, then intelligent design is not only non-falsifiable, but perhaps categorically nonsensical.
1.3.3.6.3. Con: Evolution is based on survival of the fittest. Intelligence plays no role in this process; design happens as a function of random occurrences \(except in the modern case whereby humans have been able to manipulate their environment to shape selection pressures - there is still no God or faith involved though\).
1.3.3.7. Con: You can believe one scientific claim and at the same time believe in an unrelated religious claim.
1.3.3.7.1. Con: The claim at hand takes interest in faith/science ontology \(that religion and science can coexist as long as they are not mutually contradictory\), not in epistemology \(that a person can or cannot believe in two while admitting contradictory claims from both\).
1.3.4. Pro: Science is concerned with the physical, while religion is concerned with the non-physical.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The scientific method is concerned with empirical data and is therefore silent in regards to making claims about non-empirical entities.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Scientific method provides plentiful tools to treat non-empirical entities, e.g. [Newton's Flaming Laser Sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Alder#Newton's_flaming_laser_sword) or [Sagan Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagan_standard).
1.3.4.2. Pro: While science can be used to explain the physical world and provide a mechanistic description of its processes, it is limited in that in does not explain the non-physical world and therefore doesn't cover all aspects of life.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Science doesn't explain morality.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: As human beings, we make many subjective decisions in life that are not directly related to science. For example, rating the 'quality' of a painting is usually not down to the frequencies of light that reach our eyes, or the mass of the painting.
1.3.4.3. Con: If a non-physical idea has zero bearing on the physical then it is an undetectable abstraction of zero import to our physical world. Of course this is never the case for a non-physical claim, they always are purported to have bearing on the physical, which is the realm of scientific inquiry.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: Some aspects of "faith" can be dissected on a psychological level - therefore, a physical level. [St. Paul may have had epilepsy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1032067/).
1.3.4.3.2. Con: Some ideas \(even of imaginary things\) may affect us psychologically in a way that is \(currently\) undetectable physically.
1.3.4.4. Con: What has previously seemed non-physical has consistently been found to be physical to the point where we can't safely assume that they're separate.
1.3.4.5. Con: Science is concerned with providing models to explain and predict natural phenomena, based \(in particular\) on observations. These models naturally induce reflections on the sufficient amount of causes, e.g. whether any supernatural action is required for an explanation, i.e. about the spiritual sphere.
1.3.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.
1.3.5. Con: Faith and science both address the nature of existence. This is precisely the same subject matter.
1.3.5.1. Con: Faith looks for meaning in existence, not for an explanation based on empirical evidence. They are disciplines whose object is the same but whose goals are different.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: "Meaning in existence" is almost perfect longhand for "explanation" of why the world is as it is. At this philosophical level, the goals of faith and science are the same as they both seek explanation and meaning for existence.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Con: Science does not look for meanings. There is no meaning in a proton.
1.3.5.2. Con: Science is the study of the natural world. Faith addresses the super-natural, which is not part of the natural world.
1.3.5.3. Con: The nature of existence is usually taken to be the realm of ontology or metaphysics - i.e. a branch of philosophy, not science or religion.
1.3.6. Con: Faith is an attitude applicable to all claims, obviously including claims about the natural world. It is the opposite of skepticism, the foundation of scientific inquiry.
1.3.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.1.5.
1.3.7. Pro: Religion is philosophy, and philosophy and science are not the same topics. They can both be used to address similar topics, but the basis for the rationale can often lead to different answers. Even with different rationales, they can coexist as long as each community respects the other.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Science uses math and observation to answer questions while attempting to null human emotion, and will never truly answer emotive questions such as ethics. Religion, on the other hand, is based on ancient philosophy and is very much emotionally driven.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: Religion claims to answer ethics, so when it clashes with modern thinking that is evidence that it can't supply these answers since ethics do not change over time \(owning a slave is not better because it was centuries ago\).
1.3.7.2. Pro: The necessary element in having coexistence is that both sides have to respect the value of the other. This requires relaxing forced dogma on both sides. Science can enrich our lives in many ways. Religion is a vast pool of past knowledge on ethics and thought, and can be used as a resource for developing future ethics.
1.3.7.2.1. Con: Religion shouldn't be used to develop ethics because ethics should be an objective constant in time.
1.3.7.2.1.1. Pro: Religion is interpreted, which means it is both not objective and not constant.
1.3.7.2.1.2. Pro: Religion should be used in the same context as myth is, but we should recognize it as seriously as we recognize outdated religions to prevent conflicts with evidence based science.
1.3.7.3. Con: The difference is that philosophy is a debate that can help address topics, while religion is often oppressive and can hold claims contrary to science \(e.g. Galileo, 10,000-year-old Earth creationism, etc.\).
1.3.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.
1.3.7.4. Con: Religion and science aren't philosophy. Philosophy can often interlap religion or science, but only as a tool for thinking or as an external criticism. It is a totally different matter.
1.3.8. Con: While it's true that faith and science often tackle very different subjects, that isn't always the case - there are areas where they overlap. Plenty of faith claims or religious doctrines are claims about the physical world, and can therefore be scientifically investigated.
1.3.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.
1.3.9. Pro: Science examines the world and helps us understand what we can do in it. Faith determines what we should do in it. This is co-existence.
1.3.9.1. Con: Faith suggests "what" just as much as "should". Creation stories, miracles and mythical events, and explanations of the world are generally present among faith-based constructs. Ethics and morals are present in science as well, meaning science has interest in the "should".
1.3.9.1.1. Con: The ethics and morals present in science do not come from science, they come from scientists.
1.3.9.1.1.1. Con: The ethics and morals present in religion do not come from religion, they come from theists. Point being, they are both man-made constructs regarding how people should behave.
1.3.9.1.1.2. Con: The ethics and morals are [studied](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14021-altruism-needs-selfish-genes-to-evolve-after-all/) using nothing but the scientific method, which is as good as unattached to scientists' personalities.
1.3.9.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.7.1.
1.3.9.2. Con: What we should do is suggested by our collective morals, of which only a small part is a particular faith or religion. The world does not share a common religion, but basic human morals like the protection of young, avoiding lies and murder, and creating networks.
1.3.9.3. Pro: Faith promotes moral thought. If it was scientifically possible to derive morals, then we could rely on science. However, at best, science can help us understand morality.
1.3.9.3.1. Pro: Steven Jay Gould’s theory of “[non-overlapping magisteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria)” is supportive of this argument.
1.3.9.4. Pro: Science is a human convention made for understanding the world. It is a set of rules and their nature restricts them from covering the whole meaning of life, while religion can do so since many religions started as philosophies, contemplations about living a good life, e.g. Hinduism.
1.3.10. Pro: In some cases the science only provides you with mathematical models, and the real meaning of those models is left to faith and interpretation. Such is the case with the interpretations of quantum physics.
1.3.10.1. Pro: There is a persistent epistemic gap between scientific models and "[the thing in itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself)" \(so coined by Kant\). The relationship between the model and the underlying reality demands leaps of faith into an unknowable epistemic condition.
1.4. Con: So much can be explained by science, faith is not a necessary tool for understanding life.
1.4.1. Con: Whether it is a “necessary tool” bears no logical relationship to whether faith and science can coexist.
1.4.2. Con: Some religious claims are necessarily out of reach of scientific investigation.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Religion makes claims about existence of non-empirical beings, while scientific method alone cannot make claims about the ontological status of non-empirical beings.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Faith helps us understand things that science cannot fathom, answering questions such as: "Why do we die? and "Why is there so much injustice?"
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Entropy and biology explain death. Psychology explains injustice.
1.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.9.3.
1.4.3. Con: In the grand scheme of things, it cannot. Science continues to only scratch the surface of a gargantuan body of knowledge.
1.4.3.1. Pro: We are nowhere close to having a working model to account for [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis).
1.4.3.2. Pro: We still don't have a good enough explanation for the beginning of this world. The Big Bang theory doesn't explain why it came to a Big Bang, but rather what was a fraction of second after it happened.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: The Big Bang indicates that the universe had a beginning, and therefore a beginner.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: It cannot be determined who or what started the Big Bang, and therefore it is inconclusive that faith, or a God, had any part in it.
1.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: God created the universe through the Big Bang.
1.4.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: It's been suggested the Big Bang is an ordered event, not a random, "chaotic explosion". This [implies](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/03/20/does-the-big-bang-breakthrough-offer-proof-of-god/) an intelligent creator is behind the event.
1.4.3.2.1.2.1.1. Con: It is only a suggestion, not supported by any proof.
1.4.3.2.1.2.1.2. Con: This suggestion is stated because of the belief that such order in the universe had to come from an intelligent creator, which even if more possible, is not for sure true.
1.4.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: [The Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_theory), despite being a scientific theory, carries possible theological implications regarding the concept of creation out of nothing. With the emerging evidence of the Big Bang theory, many theologians and physicists have viewed it as implicating theism. Many religions also harmonize the Big Bang with their religious tenets.
1.4.3.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: A popular philosophical argument for the existence of God known as the [Kalam cosmological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument) rests in the concepts of the Big Bang. The Kalam argument's underpinning is the impossibility of an actual infinite.
1.4.3.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: The [Nasadiya Sukta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasadiya_Sukta) \(the Hymn of Creation\) in the Rigveda mentions the world beginning from a point or bindu, through the power of heat. This can be seen as corresponding to the Big Bang theory.
1.4.3.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.6.5.
1.4.3.2.1.3. Con: The Big Bang is somewhat misunderstood. The theory states that projecting back the existing expansion of the universe yields a state with infinite density/temperature within finite time. The laws of physics as we know them will almost certainly not apply in that environment so we can only say that at this point our ability to make predictions about what came before breaks down. The theory is not that the universe has a beginning, just that it has a point we cannot project beyond.
1.4.3.2.1.4. Con: Causation is not a universal law of nature.
1.4.3.2.1.4.1. Pro: [Virtual particles](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/BlackHoles/hawking.html), for example, that randomly appear and destroy each other everywhere in the universe don't have a cause in and of themselves. They just are.
1.4.3.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Virtual particles existence is connected with existence of other particles. Therefore, in analogy to universe we would have to have another universe, which it would be related to.
1.4.3.2.1.4.1.2. Con: The fact that we don't know what causes their being doesn't mean they don't have such cause.
1.4.3.2.1.4.1.3. Con: Virtual particles are necessary for some fundamental physical processes, so in general could have known cause.
1.4.3.2.1.5. Con: The claim that a beginning requires a beginner is an unsupported artifact of thinking of the entire universe as a human society.
1.4.3.2.1.5.1. Con: The claim that anything that has a beginning has a cause is basically the [law of causality](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/law%20of%20causation). The law of causality is the basis for all science.
1.4.4. Con: Understanding life is not the only purpose of faith, so even if it is not needed for that there is still a place for it.
1.4.4.1. Pro: The human capacity to believe in things is too special to insist on never doing it. You can educate yourself on facts while still exploring hypotheticals and choosing which ones to favor.
1.4.5. Pro: Evolution refutes the need for a God.
1.4.5.1. Con: That something is not needed does not mean it doesn't exist.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) leads to conclusion that if there is no need / evidence to state that something exists, it is good to avoid doing so.
1.4.5.2. Con: While the theory of evolution weakens the need for God, it does not answer the question of how life began.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.4.5.3. Con: If God exists, he exists alongside evolution. There are many theories that are compatible with both God and evolution.
1.4.5.3.1. Pro: The Genesis story where God made humans after He made animals is compatible with evolution.
1.4.5.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.10.6.
1.4.5.3.1.2. Pro: A day for God is not necessarily a day for humans. Parables are very common in the Bible.
1.4.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: It also quite possible that God has access to resources, elements and technology that accelerate the evolutionary process, especially if it's an omnipotent being we are talking about.
1.4.5.3.1.3. Pro: It isn't stated how God created humans besides the fact that He made them in his likeness. Therefore, this does not rule out evolution. \([Genesis 1:26-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26-28&version=NIV)\)
1.4.5.3.1.3.1. Con: If God intentionally created humans, then humans were not created as a result of evolutionary processes operating on other animals.
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.6.
1.4.5.4. Con: This is intelligent design, not God. They're not interdependent concepts.
1.4.6. Con: That science can explain so much does not imply faith is unnecessary for understanding life.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Saying that "so much can be explained by science" is a self-refuting statement. Saying '"so much" can be explained by science' instead of saying '"everything" can be explained by science' admits that science is limited in its scope, and that there is a need for faith, at least to those who want to understand what science cannot uncover.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: By this logical standard, science only needs to explain *enough* to make faith unnecessary, not everything.
1.4.7. Pro: The ‘[God of the Gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps)’ concept suggests that the areas that religion alone explains are becoming smaller and smaller as a result of scientific advancements.
1.4.7.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.4.7.2. Con: However, it's necessary to consider that the "decrease" of areas that religion alone can explain isn't necessarily a decrease, since there are things that we don't know. So, it isn't that clear if science is "taking the lead".
1.4.8. Con: If the same things can be explained by faith, it could be that science is the unnecessary tool for understanding life.
1.4.8.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.9. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.4.10. Pro: Science in its complexity, currently and progressively, through time, dissolves the need for speculative reasoning and belief.
1.4.10.1. Con: By the time science as a thought tool has answered most critical questions, the human population will have evolved into something\(s\) else or has become extinct.
1.4.10.2. Pro: Psychology, anthropology, sociology - these fields of science, as do many more, arguably, go in far greater depths and complexities of the questions asked by most faiths, and provably address the issues in a methodologically sounder manner to provide more tangible proof than any faith could.
1.4.10.3. Con: Not all topics can be explored by science, such as "what happens to a soul after death?" Those questions are important to many, if not all, people.
1.4.10.3.1. Con: Obviously there are ways of answering questions that require neither science nor religion. For example, "Do you like chocolate ice cream?"
1.4.10.3.1.1. Con: A question about desserts carries less weight than one about the afterlife. Trusting in science to uncover answers about an afterlife 100 years from now still leaves the aging with a desire for answers now. There are already a myriad of wonderful dessert options.
1.4.10.3.2. Con: The answers to metaphysical questions can come just as easily from speculation as from religious authority.
1.4.10.3.3. Pro: On the concept of exploring by science, there are more sections of the human population that do not know of scientific thought than those who do. This stems from: \(1\) lack of training or education in scientific thought, \(2\) by rejecting the necessity of scientific thought, or \(3\) utilizing a selective duality into their personal belief system that uses both science and faith.
1.4.10.3.4. Con: The problem is the "solutions" that religion proposes are justified by their framework. They are not bound by reality unless the religion itself has rigorous proof. Religion makes us feel better about our place in the universe by providing quick answers to these questions, but without a large body of evidence validating the framework itself these answers are invalid.
1.4.10.3.4.1. Con: Jesus resurrected from death, which is justification for believing in the claims Christianity makes about life after death. The claims of Jesus resurrecting have [good support](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/historical-evidence-for-the-resurrection#fn1).
1.4.10.3.5. Con: Philosophy exists for the search for these questions. Religion exists to claim to have found the solution.
1.4.10.3.5.1. Pro: Religion exists without a sufficient evidence base, so its claims are invalid. Philosophy is a search and so has nothing to prove.
1.4.10.3.5.1.1. Pro: Religion [shifts over time](http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-01/news/mn-1827_1_galileo-galilei) as religion is interpreted. If something is based on evidence, then it remains static, void of new evidence. Any developments in religion must therefore have accompanying evidence to be accepted as an evidence-based development and not a social one.
1.4.10.3.5.1.1.1. Con: This is not a problem for religious propositions. They should modify and change based on new evidence. This is called being intellectually responsible and true to the evidence.
1.4.10.3.5.1.2. Pro: Religion is known for having insufficient evidence, hence why “choosing your own religion” is a human right. Evidence leads to fact, which cannot be chosen – that is why people either accept science or refuse to accept it, they do not choose which science to believe in because they can’t \(and why there is no human right to choose scientific beliefs\).
1.4.10.3.5.1.3. Pro: The fact that many religions do have geographic tendencies suggests that religion has a regional appeal, not an objective one which would require random distribution across the world \([Christianity is the only major religion somewhat evenly distributed, but still has clear gaps](http://geographical.co.uk/places/mapping/item/1059-world-religions)\) .
1.4.10.3.5.1.3.1. Con: Judging the truth value of any proposition \(religious or otherwise\) based on how \(or where\) it was generated is an example of the [genetic fallacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy). You cannot falsify a proposition such as “Jesus is God” by appealing to how that proposition was generated. You must defeat the present case offered for a claim. This is because belief in a proposition could be unjustified and yet the proposition could still be true.
1.4.10.3.5.1.3.1.1. Con: The argument is not about religious origin, but about current religious distribution. If a single religion had more evidence than others, over time that religion would likely overtake others and begin being distributed evenly throughout the world since it would have the means to disprove other religions.
1.5. Pro: A religious person can be scientific, just as a scientific person can be religious.
1.5.1. Pro: Christianity in particular has made an [overwhelming contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christians_in_science_and_technology) to modern science. A strong [case](http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages) can be made that modern science in the West is the direct result of Christian influence and thought.
1.5.1.1. Con: Citing the number of Christians in a particular field has absolutely nothing to do with the impact of Christianity as an institution on that field. It is only a reflection of Christianity's predominance as a religion over the last millennium. There is nothing to say the same discoveries wouldn't have been made by a scientist of another religion were that religion the predominant religion of that era.
1.5.1.2. Pro: [Historically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_science), Christianity has often been a patron of sciences. It has been prolific in the foundation of schools, universities and hospitals, and many clergy have been active in the sciences.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Modern historians of science such as J.L. Heilbron, Alistair Cameron Crombie, David Lindberg, Edward Grant, Thomas Goldstein, and Ted Davis have reviewed the popular notion that medieval Christianity was a negative influence in the development of civilization and science. In their views, the monks [saved and cultivated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_science) the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions and promoted learning and science through the sponsorship of many universities.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: St. Thomas Aquinas, the Church's "model theologian", not only argued that reason is in harmony with faith, he even recognized that reason can contribute to understanding revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development. He was not unlike other medieval theologians who sought out reason in the effort to defend his faith. Some of today's scholars, such as Stanley Jaki, have claimed that [Christianity with its particular worldview was a crucial factor for the emergence of modern science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_science).
1.5.1.2.3. Pro: David C. Lindberg states that the widespread popular belief that the Middle Ages was a time of ignorance and superstition due to the Christian church is a "caricature". It was common to tolerate and encourage critical thinking about the nature of the world. The relation between Christianity and science is complex and [cannot be simplified to either harmony or conflict,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_science) according to Lindberg.
1.5.2. Pro: Science is a product of faith, as many scientific advancements were made in [monasteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_school#Contributions_to_Science_in_the_Middle_Ages).
1.5.2.1. Pro: A number of [people of faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christians_in_science_and_technology) founded scientific works or movements.
1.5.2.2. Con: Even if faith is indeed the source of science, science also has a lot of other sources.
1.5.2.3. Con: Science progress was often slowed due to faith.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.1.
1.5.2.3.2. Pro: Heliocentrism for long time was denied by church\[[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html),[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair)\].
1.5.2.3.3. Pro: Keeping hard on already stated laws, especially by their creators, led to denial of many better ones due to faith that the stated ones are true.
1.5.2.3.4. Con: The supposed history of warfare between science and religion is a myth.
1.5.2.3.4.1. Con: By their definition they are opposed as one is about fact \(things statistically proven with evidence\) and one is about faith \(the act of believing something is true, where evidence isn't requisite\); to say they aren't in direct conflict implies religion isn't about faith, science isn't about fact, or that fact and faith are not opposites.
1.5.2.3.4.1.1. Con: If faith is the "act of believing something is true, where evidence isn't requisite" then science itself is established on faith. The very foundational propositions of science must be believed without evidence \(e.g. logic works, math works, physical reality is real, etc.\).
1.5.2.3.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.5.2.3.4.1.2. Con: There are theological propositions and scientific propositions. We should differentiate between propositions and the epistemological methods to arrive at those propositions.
1.5.2.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.5.2.3.4.3. Con: The progression of science has led to the emergence of a better world, lifesaving technology and innovations that have liberated humankind from the perils of the past. Faith has impeded and denigrated scientific pursuits based on beliefs which are unsupported and deny fact-based principles, making further and much needed progress in scientific endeavors difficult.
1.5.2.3.4.3.1. Con: Confirmation bias. An accurate representation must include all examples - which are vast - where faith has advanced intellectual inquiry, economic prosperity, liberty, and human rights.
1.5.2.3.4.3.2. Pro: Science can be used to fight wars, but it has never started a war.
1.5.2.3.4.3.3. Con: Many wars have been fought over religion, including slightly different flavors of religion \(e.g.: Catholics vs Protestants, Sunni vs Shite\).
1.5.2.3.4.3.4. Con: Many non-military horrors have been done in the name of religion such as The Spanish Inquisition, American and European witch trials, and the 9-11 terrorist attacks.
1.5.2.3.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.3.
1.5.2.3.4.5. Pro: The notion of a law of nature, foundational to modern science, originated in the scientific revolution as a theistic \(or deistic\) metaphor - it was believed there was a divine law-giver who decreed that objects obey certain physical laws \(e.g. Newtonian gravity, etc.\), and that these laws could be discovered.
1.5.2.3.4.5.1. Con: Ad traditionem. The principle, under which a hypothesis is to be verified by means of independent reproducible experiments, was developed to prove the existence of [supernatural action of weapon salve](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Weapon_salve). As a result, it was used to disprove decisively that any such action exists.
1.5.2.3.4.5.1.1. Con: The parent to the above claim is not an appeal to tradition - it is not claiming that the 'divine law-giver' account of natural laws is correct merely because it was historically important. It is only supporting the original claim that faith has, historically, been an important catalyst of scientific work \(which says nothing about whether scientific work has vindicated said faith or not\). So the charge of appeal to tradition is incorrect.
1.5.2.3.4.5.1.1.1. Con: The claim just states that though faith and science were able to coexist once and faith could have given impulses for scientific thought, it doesn't necessarily mean that faith and science can coexist now, just as science can't coexist any longer with the belief in sympathetic magic, even though the latter used to promote scientific research once.
1.5.2.3.4.6. Pro: The [idea of warfare](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/science-theology/what-is-the-relation-between-science-and-religion/) between science and religion is a relatively recent invention of the late 19th century, carefully nurtured by secular thinkers.
1.5.2.3.4.6.1. Pro: Back in 1896, the president of Cornell University [Andrew Dickson White](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Dickson_White) published a book entitled [A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_History_of_the_Warfare_of_Science_with_Theology_in_Christendom). Under White’s influence, the metaphor of “warfare” to describe the relations between science and the Christian faith became very widespread during the first half of the 20th century.
1.5.2.3.4.6.2. Con: Galileo was put in jail because his findings countered those of the church, the Christians in the Colosseum, and so forth. Religion has been protected by threat of death for most of history, so it would be impossible for the conflict of science and religion to have surfaced, because individuals who would raise such a claim would be persecuted. Thus the fact that this is a recent development is irrelevant, because it of the unlikelihood that it would have occurred before recent times.
1.5.2.3.4.6.2.1. Con: If the parent is true then one could conclude that Christianity as a worldview, at minimum, is compatible with science. If these viewpoints were able to arise out of a predominantly Christian worldview, then it is unclear that Christianity stands in opposition to science.
1.5.2.3.4.6.2.2. Con: If it was "impossible" for the conflict of science and religion to have surfaced, then it becomes unclear why it ever surfaced in the first place.
1.5.2.3.4.7. Pro: For over 300 years, between the rise of modern science in the 1500s and the late 1800s, the relationship between science and religion can best be described as an alliance.
1.5.2.3.4.7.1. Con: Within this time frame Galileo was locked in jail and Michael Servetus was executed in the name of the church. Any "alliance" between religion and science was likely due to the suppression of science against religion.
1.5.2.3.4.8. Pro: During the last quarter century, a [flourishing](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/science-theology/what-is-the-relation-between-science-and-religion/) dialogue between science and theology has been going on in North America and Europe. Clearly faith and science can, at bare minimum, have mutually respectful discussion.
1.5.2.3.4.8.1. Pro: In an address before a conference on the history and philosophy of thermodynamics, the prominent British physicist [P. T. Landsberg](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-professor-peter-landsberg-theoretical-physicist-1-805344/amp) suddenly [began to explore](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4NIDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA380&lpg=PA380&dq=“To+talk+about+the+implications+of+science+for+theology+at+a+scientific+meeting+seems+to+break+a+taboo.+But+those+who+think+so+are+out+of+date.+During+the+last+15+years,+this+taboo+has+been+removed,+and+in+talking+about+the+interaction+of+science+and+theology,+I+am+actually+moving+with+a+tide.”&source=bl&ots=JpSRz0KF66&sig=u72-EkY36PPUB4g5X73RUvXvwO4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjvi83VpJvdAhXrQ98KHdzJBsgQ6AEwAXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=“To%20talk%20about%20the%20implications%20of%20science%20for%20theology%20at%20a%20scientific%20meeting%20seems%20to%20break%20a%20taboo.%20But%20those%20who%20think%20so%20are%20out%20of%20date.%20During%20the%20last%2015%20years%2C%20this%20taboo%20has%20been%20removed%2C%20and%20in%20talking%20about%20the%20interaction%20of%20science%20and%20theology%2C%20I%20am%20actually%20moving%20with%20a%20tide.”&f=false) the theological implications of the scientific theory he was discussing.
1.5.2.3.4.8.2. Pro: [ESSSAT](http://www.esssat.eu/about-esssat/) is an organization established “to advance the open and critical communication between theology and science; to share knowledge for the mutual benefit of each; and to work on the solution of interdisciplinary problems.”
1.5.2.3.4.8.3. Pro: [SRF](https://www.srforum.org/about) exists to promote discussion between scientific understanding and religious thought on issues at the interface of science and religion, and membership is open to people of any religion or none.
1.5.2.3.4.8.4. Pro: [CTNS](http://www.ctns.org/about.html) is an international program dedicated to research, teaching and public service. The central scientific focus of CTNS is on developments in physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, and genetics, with additional topics in the neurosciences, the environmental sciences, and mathematics. With regard to the theological task, CTNS engages in both Christian and multi-religious reflection.
1.5.2.3.4.8.5. Pro: There have been on-going conferences sponsored by the Berkeley Center and the Vatican Observatory, in which prominent scientists like Stephen Hawking and Paul Davies have explored the implications of science for theology with prominent theologians like John Polkinghorne and Wolfhart Pannenberg.
1.5.2.3.4.8.6. Pro: The journal [Zygon](http://www.zygonjournal.org/about.html) provides a forum for exploring ways to unite what in modern times has been disconnected—values from knowledge, goodness from truth, religion from science.
1.5.2.3.4.8.7. Pro: [ASA's](https://network.asa3.org/page/ASAAbout) unique mission is to integrate, communicate, and facilitate properly researched science and theology in service to the Church and the scientific community.
1.5.2.3.4.8.8. Pro: Secular journals like Nature and the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science carry articles on the mutual implications of science and theology. [Example 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/443010a). [Example 2](https://www.nature.com/articles/434684a). [Example 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms201532). [Example 4](https://academic.oup.com/bjps/article-abstract/52/2/371/1435926?redirectedFrom=fulltext). [Example 5](https://academic.oup.com/bjps/article/59/4/675/1581972?searchresult=1).
1.5.2.3.4.8.9. Pro: The [Templeton Foundation](https://www.templeton.org) has awarded its million dollar Templeton Award in Science and Religion to outstanding integrative thinkers such as [Paul Davies](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html), [John Polkinghorne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Polkinghorne), and [George Ellis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._R._Ellis) for their work in science and religion.
1.5.2.3.4.8.10. Pro: Both Cambridge University and Oxford University have established chairs in science and theology \(Writing That Makes Sense, [pg.462](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=RkZKAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA462#v=onepage&q=Cambridge%20University%20Oxford%20University&f=false)\).
1.5.2.3.4.8.11. Con: For centuries, many religions tried to replace science with unquestionable set of dogmas. There's no real communication between the two, as their logical structures are incompatible.
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.1. Con: This is rarely true, many early Christian theologians for example, believed in ensuring and testing all biblical claims. In fact, the recent young Earth trend in the church is, in fact, only recent. [Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo) for one did not believe in 6 day creation, and the Bible talks extensively about testing what you have been told.
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.1.1. Con: The church's historic suppression of contrary beliefs suggests that Christianity is not encouraging the testing of its practices.
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.1.2. Con: Even if the young Earth trend is recent, it still speaks to an encouragement of irrationality if a disproportionate amount of individuals who disbelieve in the Earth's age are of religious belief. This suggests a lack of testing on the part of religious bodies.
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.1.2.1. Con: Extrapolating that religious bodies are more prone to irrationality based on a small representative sample is nothing more than cherry picking.
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.2. Pro: When the \(Catholic\) church made some scientific principles compatible with religious ideas, they did so with the threat of force against any scientific idea they disagreed with. Using the threat of force to destroy ideas cannot be considered peaceful coexistence between anything, especially when those things are nothing more than ideas themselves.
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.2.1. Pro: During most of the 16th and 17th centuries, fear of heretics spreading teachings and opinions that contradicted the Bible dominated the Catholic Church. The Church [persecuted](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1675/copernicus-galileo-and-the-church-science-in-a-religious-world) scientists who formed theories the Church deemed heretical and forbade people from reading any books on those subjects by placing the books on the [Index of Prohibited Books.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum) Nicholas Copernicus and Galileo Galilei were two scientists who printed books that later became banned.
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.2.1.1. Pro: Many scientists were hunted by inquisition \(e.g. [Cecco d'Ascoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecco_d%27Ascoli), [Galileo Galilei](https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html)\) due to the fact that their statements were incompatible with faith.
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.2.1.1.1. Con: "Admittedly, [Galileo](http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages) was put on trial for claiming it is a fact that the Earth goes around the sun, rather than just a hypothesis as the Catholic Church demanded. Still, historians have found that even his trial was as much a case of papal egotism as scientific conservatism. It hardly deserves to overshadow all the support that the Church has given to scientific investigation over the centuries."
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.2.1.1.2. Con: A couple of examples or data points is not enough to establish a "trend" that the church suppressed science by "hunting" scientists. The parent implies that there are many more, yet does not provide them.
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.3.
1.5.2.3.4.8.11.3. Con: -> See 1.5.1.2.
1.5.2.3.4.8.12. Con: Scientists and theists having a respectful conversation is no different than a misogynist and feminist doing the same. The fact of the matter is the beliefs themselves inherently cannot both be true and conflict by definition. Mutually respectful discussion is not enough to prove co-existence.
1.5.2.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.3.4.8.11.2.1.1.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.6.
1.5.4. Pro: Many religious people [believe in science](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150129093903.htm).
1.5.4.1. Pro: If there are, and have been, many scientists who are/were also theists, faith and science can co-exist, both in a society, and within individuals.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: The question of co-existence is not time-bound; all previous scientific theists were products of their time, and thus insufficient to project forward towards the subject of the question; a more fully developed science v. a more fully developed religion \(which we have achieved\).
1.5.4.2. Pro: Most of the greatest scientific minds in history were deeply religious persons who understood their limitations. Their faith was founded in the belief that God is a very logical entity and scientifically knowable.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: For example, Isaac Newton. He viewed his physics and math findings as a means to learn about God. “This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.” [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/232391-this-most-beautiful-system-of-the-sun-planets-and-comets)
1.5.4.3. Con: A belief does not equate to acceptance of co-existence. A religious person can also believe that they exist separately.
1.5.4.4. Pro: Many Christians find science exciting and fascinating because they accredit all creation to God. The study and discovery of how all things work, the logic and perfect order in form and function is another unveiling of His mind. Nothing about science challenges Christians' belief in God.
1.5.4.5. Con: This is a generalisation. Many scientific people do not believe in faith, one would not accept that as sufficient argument against faith.
1.5.4.6. Con: Science is not a matter of belief. It's an instrument to explore the world.
1.5.4.6.1. Con: Science is an instrument to find true propositions about the world. These truths have to be believed in if we are to advance.
1.5.4.7. Con: While most [people](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10943-017-0433-x) believe in science when it conforms to their beliefs, many religious people deny the validity of scientific evidence if it would challenge their beliefs.
1.5.4.7.1. Con: It is unjustified to criticize human persons for trying to hold coherent beliefs. Propositions come from many sources and all must be evaluated and integrated into an individual’s view of the world. This holds for the secularist as much as for the religious person.
1.5.4.7.2. Con: "Science" is used by many to promote beliefs that have no proven evidence, but are popular. In chemistry or physics, for example, an idea can be a hypothesis, but to become a theory, it must be tested by trying to prove it's wrong. Evolution is called a theory, but is actually a doctrine or dogma.
1.5.4.7.3. Con: It does not seem appropriate to measure all faiths by the actions of some. Many of faith understand science and history and are willing to reconsider their understanding of faith based on new discoveries, just as a scientist would amend their understanding of science based on new discoveries.
1.5.4.7.4. Pro: Many religious groups do not agree with scientific theory of how the universe was created.
1.5.4.7.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.6.
1.5.4.7.4.2. Con: The text of [Genesis 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.1.24-Gen.1.25&version=AKJV) opens the possibility of interpreting that God created the dinosaurs, and is thus in line with contemporary scientific theory.
1.5.4.7.4.2.1. Con: Not all religious people strictly adhere to religious texts.
1.5.4.7.5. Con: Some people are comfortable holding multiple beliefs.
1.5.4.8. Con: Many religious people reject science.
1.5.4.8.1. Pro: Many religious people oppose some of today's scientific advancements in improving and extending human life.
1.5.4.8.1.1. Con: Life is one of the core concepts of most religions. If those scientific advancements are not going against morals, then those religious people are contradicting themselves.
1.5.4.8.2. Con: Many scientists have \(or had, regarding historical ones\) a belief in religion that's either co-existing independently or whose ideas are influencing each other.
1.5.4.8.2.1. Pro: The psychiatrist [Richard Gallagher](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/01/as-a-psychiatrist-i-diagnose-mental-illness-and-sometimes-demonic-possession/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.691ff0a9eada) was treating mental illness with psychiatry, as well as the occasional demonic possession with exorcism.
1.5.4.8.2.2. Pro: The Father of the Big Bang Theory, [Georges Lemaitre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lemaître), was a Catholic Priest and physics professor.
1.5.4.8.2.2.1. Pro: The Big Bang is now accepted by physicists, cosmologists, and can be observed thanks to the Hubble Telescope. Study of the data delves into the beginning of space and time.
1.5.4.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: Although many scientists are agnostic or atheists, the logical conclusion is that there must be a beginning force of some kind.
1.5.4.8.2.2.1.2. Pro: There are physicists such as Michael Strauss of the University of Oklahoma, who study the Big Bang. He concludes that it proves the existence of a creator. His recent [book](https://www.westbowpress.com/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-001153927) that covers these claims is The Creator Revealed, A Physicist Examines the Big Bang and the Bible.
1.5.4.8.2.3. Pro: [André Tacquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/André_Tacquet), a Jesuit mathematician laid the groundwork for what would later become calculus.
1.5.4.8.2.3.1. Con: Mathematics is a tool used in science, but is not a science itself.
1.5.4.8.2.3.1.1. Con: [Mathematics](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mathematics) is the abstract science of number, quantity, and space, either as abstract concepts \(pure mathematics\), or as applied to other disciplines such as physics and engineering \(applied mathematics\).
1.5.4.8.2.4. Pro: [Sir Francis Bacon](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/12-famous-scientists-on-the-possibility-of-god_us_56afa292e4b057d7d7c7a1e5), known as the father of the scientific method, was an Anglican.
1.5.4.8.2.5. Pro: [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal), who made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics and wrote a defence of the scientific method, paving the way for the Age of Enlightenment philosophers many of whom left religion, stuck firmly and became and ardent proponent of it. His development of probability theory led to his argument of [Pascal's wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager), which used his scientific work to justify his religious beliefs.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1. Con: [Pascal's Wager](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager) is a problematic argument that doesn't convincingly justify religious beliefs.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1. Pro: The notion proposed by Pascal in his Wager is inherently flawed.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: The idea that "you should believe" assumes that you have a choice over what you believe: ["ought implies can"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ought_implies_can). However, one cannot choose their beliefs, and so there is no "should" with regard to belief. \(Perhaps there is only rational or irrational.\)
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: You do not choose your beliefs through volition. You are convinced.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: People can refuse to be convinced, especially when they have social support for their established belief.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: It is impossible for a sane person to sincerely believe in something they don't genuinely think is true, or at least do not think is false.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Many people take risks when they believe in part of a very complex notion but have doubts about other parts. God honors this kind of belief, as can be seen in the life of Abraham. He believed God enough to leave his homeland for a new land, but doubted when he became old and childless to the extent that he had a child with his wife's maid. God still honored his promise to Abraham, made when Abraham first believed, and gave him a child by his wife, among many other answered promises.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Another example may be a trust fall. A person may in general trust the people there to catch them. But may feel much doubt due to the newness of the situation. They may scream when they fall, showing their lack of total faith. But the fact that they fell shows enough faith to be caught and have an experience where faith grows. The next time they fall, they may not scream.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: Belief without evidence is against rational thinking.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Many positive emotions and activities are outside rational thinking; this does not mean that they do not bring benefit to the lives of those who engage with them.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Belief without evidence being irrational is not the same as emotions outside rationality. Beliefs are not emotions.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2. Con: To say that there is no evidence is simply false.  Example of at least some evidence being that there is a clear [historical person known as Jesus of Nazareth.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus)
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Even if there was a historical person named Jesus of Nazareth, that does not support the idea that he was a god of some kind.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: We're not just referring to any Jesus of Nazareth. But Jesus of the Bible. According to the New Testament authors, Jesus claimed to be God. Since we [know Jesus existed](https://www.kialo.com/what-is-the-best-religion-to-believe-3371/3371.0=3371.13-3371.27-3371.333+3371.497), and He claimed to be God, it follows that He is God.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Simply claiming to be god is no evidence of being god, even if claimed by a provably real person.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: [Did Jesus Exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Did_Jesus_Exist%3F_\(Ehrman\)) is a book by Bart Ehrman, a leading scholar of the New Testament, writer of over twenty-five books \(including three college textbooks\) in that field of study and an agnostic. Written to counter the idea that there was never such a person as Jesus Christ at all, Ehrman sets out to demonstrate the historical evidence for Jesus' existence, and he aims to state why all experts in the area agree that "whatever else you may think about Jesus, he certainly did exist."
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: The evidence presented by Bart Ehrman falls short of the conclusions he makes. [Historicity of Jesus](https://books.google.com/books/about/On_the_Historicity_of_Jesus.html?id=EWIJoAEACAAJ)
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.3. Pro: The eyewitnesses of Jesus's life and his resurrection have been carefully documented by men named Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Peter. Their testimonies have been well preserved over the ages.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.3.1. Con: Eyewitness reports, especially those from two millennia ago, are not sufficient evidence for supernatural events. One can find eyewitness reports of almost anything, such as Bigfoot, aliens, the Loch Ness Monster etc.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.3.1.1. Con: [The evidence indicates](http://coldcasechristianity.com/2015/why-i-know-the-gospels-were-written-early-free-bible-insert/) the Gospels are, indeed, early enough to have been written by eyewitnesses. If they were written this early, in the very region where the events took place, it would have been difficult for them to include obvious lies, given that they would have been written to people who were alive during the events recorded in the New Testament. These people would have been available to vet the content of the Gospels and call them out as lies if they contained fallacious information.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The relative proliferation of biblical texts compared to other writings of the time would have made such obvious lies especially difficult to gain the momentum they did as the foundation of the world's eventual most popular religion.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Even if the Gospels were written when eyewitnesses were alive, and eyewitnesses “called out” certain aspects of the Gospels as lies, their act of calling out may not have been preserved over the past 2000 years.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.3.2. Pro: The Gospels were written by individuals drawing from either personal first hand experience or the first hand experience of reliable witnesses.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: The gospels contain accounts embarrassing to the early church founders and are therefore likely not outright fabrications.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: The gospel describes Peter's [three denials of Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_Peter). This is an embarrassing account that would likely not be written unless it was true.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.3.2.2. Pro: If the New Testament authors were making false claims for personal gain, they would not have universally committed to martyrdom.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.1.3.2.4. Con: -> See discussion #8515: Jesus probably did not exist as an historical person
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: Pascal's Wager is flawed in that it proposes infinite utility gains and losses. When you introduce infinity into utility equations, it turns out that every possible action \(as long as it has the possibility, however small, of converting you\) should have an infinite expected utility value. For this reason, going to the park is just as valid a response to Pascal's Wager as going to church.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Any fraction of infinity is still infinity. Therefore, any action that offers a non-zero chance of increasing faith can be justified, by the following equation. Value of action = probability of reward * value of reward.
The value of the reward is infinite. Therefore any non-zero value for 'probability of reward' leads to infinity for 'Value of action'.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.2.2. Con: Someone who understands Pascal's Wager to this extent is not more likely to be converted by going to church than by going to the park anyway, though. The knowledge needed to decide has been attained. And the only variable left is if this person believes or doesn't.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.3. Pro: Pascal's wager justifies the belief in Gods in general, but not necessarily the God of Christianity. If I proposed that there existed a God who would send you to super-heaven and super-hell based on your belief, then Pascal's Wager would say you should believe in that God over the God of Christianity. It does not advocate for the belief in an established God, but instead in the theoretical deity that promises the most reward/punishment.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.3.1. Con: Pascal asserts that the probability of God existing is a [50/50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager) chance. And he was taught the God of the Bible. If he were to hear of your god, the probability might lower quite a bit, thus vastly changing the wager.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.4. Pro: Pascal's Wager assumes a particular theology: one where the God rewards belief and not action. If God doesn't judge you based on your belief in him, however, any perceived gain in believing is meaningless.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.4.1. Con: In this version of the Bible, God will punish non-believers: "But the cowardly, the [unbelieving](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelations%2021:8&version=NIV), the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur."
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Despite Pascal's theology, Christianity does not describe the only God this wager could apply to.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.4.2. Con: It is a false dichotomy to say that God rewards belief but not action. God rewards both. God rewards our actions, but our actions only merit hell. "[For all have sinned](https://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm)" and "[the wages of sin is death](https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm)." The way out is [belief in Jesus.](https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm) So He will reward my actions by saying 'you deserve hell' but He will reward my belief by saying 'you are saved by faith in Jesus.'
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.5. Pro: God may punish feigned belief or 'tokenism' visits to religious buildings \(e.g. for considering a doubting mind in Church to be blasphemous\). This consideration changes the Wager.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.5.1. Con: The difference for punishment for this and for unbelief is relatively small. Both are eternal damnation. True belief is what brings eternal life. And considering the afterlife, including in a manner such as Pascal's Wager, can help bring someone to the point of true belief.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.6. Pro: This claim, Pascal's Wager, is countered by the [Atheist's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist%27s_Wager).
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.7. Pro: This assumes god wouldn't be able to distinguish between a true believer and someone "believing" for personal gain,  which contradicts the assertion of an omniscient deity; God may even punish feigned belief. This consideration changes the Wager.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.7.1. Pro: In almost all religion your ability to enter the kingdom of heaven is an assessment of heart and not of mind. That is to say one must truly believe God’s existence rather than just accepting it through logical choice.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.7.2. Con: The notion that a true believer does not believe for personal gain is a false dichotomy, according to the Bible. For instance, [Romans 2:7](https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm) says that eternal life is for those who seek glory and honor and immortality. Choosing to trust that God is the source of these things gives a lot of honor to God, and is a great display of faith. \(This is also supported by [Hebrews 11:6](https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-6.htm) that says those who would please God must believe that He rewards those who seek Him.\)
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.8. Pro: The Apostle Paul would have rejected Pascal's Wager. In [1 Corinthians 15:12-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A12-19&version=ESV), he argues that the Christian faith is of no value if Christ has not been raised from the dead. From Paul's perspective, there is much to be lost in this life from believing in a God that does not exist.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.8.1. Con: Paul also taught much about being patient with those of weak faith. For instance,[Romans 14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+14&version=NIV). So while he might strongly counter certain displays of doubt by certain people, as he did when the Corinthians doubted resurrection, he might not do that in all cases and it might be up to the given circumstances \(new or mature believer, culture, etc\). He might 'become like a gambler to those who gamble,' so to speak, as he strives to be "[all things to all people](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+9%3A19-23&version=NIV)."
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.1.8.2. Con: Even if people, who believe in a God who then does not exist, are to be pitied above all other humans, the state of humankind as a whole, if there is no afterlife, is quite [pitiable](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+12&version=NIV). This sentiment is expressed well in Pascal's Wager. Pascal loses out on 80 or so good years of living, and that is pitiable if he has no reward for it, but worth the risk to him because the reward is so great.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.2. Pro: The problem with [Pascal's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager) is that it requires true belief. If a person does not believe in a god but still professes his faith, he is an idle worshiper, which means that not only is he not believing in a god, he is adding an additional sin.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.2.1. Con: This is not necessarily a problem because people who have faith are granted the grace of doubts. The Bible has examples of the disciple [Thomas expressing doubt](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+20%3A24-29&version=NIV) and a man expressing the nuance of faith with doubt in saying "[I believe. Help my unbelief](https://biblehub.com/mark/9-24.htm)." Therefore, a person may believe in some aspects of God but struggle with others, and God will be gracious, patient, and helpful to provide more assurance.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: God showed much patience with the disciples when they did not understand His teachings at first. For instance, they needed to be shown the miraculous feeding of [4000](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+8&version=HCSB) even after the miraculous feeding of [5000](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+6%3A30-44&version=NIV), and even then Jesus takes the time to teach them when He sees that they do not understand when they are afraid of not having enough bread in the [boat](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+8&version=HCSB) shortly after.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.3. Con: Jesus had teachings with similar sentiment, but more clarity and more detail, before Pascal did and would have more authority than Pascal since Pascal was Christian.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: Jesus [taught](https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-20.htm) His followers to "store up treasure in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy and thieves do not break in a steal" instead of storing up treasure on earth, asserting that the two are mutually exclusive.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.3.2. Pro: Jesus [taught](https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-29.htm) His followers that it was better to enter into the Kingdom with their eyes gouged out or their hands cut off, in order to avoid sin, than to enter hell with a whole body.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.3.3. Pro: Jesus [taught](https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm) that His followers should not fear other humans who could kill them, but instead to fear God who has power to kill and to send people's souls to hell.
1.5.4.8.2.5.1.4. Con: It is only problematic if used in an unintended manner. Pascal himself said [reason is feeble compared to Scripture](http://2012daily.com/?q=node/138). So incorrectly seeing his argument as all the proof he had for the existence of God and then showing how it doesn’t prove God is a “straw man”. We must see his argument as his reason to engage Scripture in the first place. If his argument convinces to at least engage Scripture, then we must address Scripture and try to find truth or faults within it.
1.5.4.8.2.5.2. Con: Pascal [lived and died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal) before the [Age of Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment).
1.5.4.8.2.6. Pro: A [significant part](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/what-scientists-believe) of the scientists have some religion or faith that extrapolate science.
1.5.4.8.2.6.1. Con: According to the source in the parent, scientists are eight times more likely to be atheists than the general population.
1.5.4.8.2.7. Pro: Many established scientists were part of the [Catholic Clergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Catholic_clergy_scientists).
1.5.4.8.2.7.1. Con: This may have been common throughout history, but it is not true [today](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnfarrell/2015/05/23/the-decline-of-the-priest-scientist/#4421fabd1d0e).
1.5.4.8.2.7.1.1. Con: [George Coyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Coyne) is a Jesuit astronomer and was the former director of the Vatican Observatory based out of the University of Arizona. He is still alive today in the year 2018.
1.5.4.8.2.7.1.2. Con: [Tadeusz Pacholczyk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadeusz_Pacholczyk) is a living American Catholic Priest and neuroscientist. \(2018\)
1.5.4.8.2.8. Pro: Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton [were Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christians_in_science_and_technology).
1.5.4.8.3. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.5.4.8.4. Con: Even if they do so, it is not necessary to reject science to be truly religious.
1.5.4.8.4.1. Con: It is unclear that this is true. Claims about what constitutes that which is "truly religious" ought to be precisely qualified or they quickly dissolve into facile vagueness.
1.5.4.8.4.2. Con: It may be that "true religion" categorically refers to relationships with truth and/or knowledge which are acutely incompatible with the scientific method.
1.5.4.8.5. Con: The question is whether the two can coexist, not whether they do in all cases. While many religious people reject science, many religious people also embrace science. Thus, the two can coexist.
1.5.4.8.5.1. Pro: One's personal preference is not proof that faith and science cannot coexist.
1.5.4.8.6. Pro: Many people believe religious conviction is to be built upon claims which can be neither verified or tested.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.8.2.
1.5.6. Con: This is an irrelevant point. People generally \(including scientists\) tend to hold views that are not comprehensively logical, or internally consistent across the board. Yet, we have very good philosophical reasons \(logical absolutes\) to suspect our universe to be logically consistent \(even given quantum weirdness\). Scientists can be and often are wrong, but this says nothing about whether the scientific method is compatible with religion, religious faith, or the supernatural.
1.5.6.1. Con: People who are capable enough of understanding the logic required for science are also in many cases capable to see how faith is logical as well and how the possibility of it complementing science is logically consistent.
1.6. Pro: As the dynamics and the relationship between science and faith changes, both can coexist at different points in human history.
1.6.1. Pro: [Transhumanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) argue that as Science advances it will become itself a beacon of Faith in man's capacity.
1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #13564: Transhumanism is the next step in human evolution.
1.6.1.2. Con: The faith would be based on the evidence that is the modifications on humans. This is faith in evidence as opposed to blind faith.
1.6.2. Pro: They can co-exist as long as faith cannot be ruled out by science. For now it can't be.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Faith cannot, by definition, be 'ruled out' by science. The best science can do is to address claims that are made by religious, faith-based traditions. Science cannot escape the pragmatic necessity of making axiomatic assumptions that are necessary in order to exist in the world.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Science is not about axioms but about looking at the evidence and predicting what will happen next. Theories arise, predictions about the axioms, but they are not assumed so much as inferred from the reality we inhabit. Comparing axioms derived through science to religion is therefore invalid, since religion uses axioms void of evidence.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Sometimes science appears to contradict faith because those defining it can't see the physics of a miracle or the existence of a spiritual realm even as they consider the possibility of dark matter and string theory that have some seemingly unprovable traits.
1.6.2.3. Con: The burden of proof lies on the one making the claim. Religion needs to be proven, not dis-proven.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.4.10.
1.6.4. Pro: Until a couple of centuries ago, faith and science co-existed perfectly.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Until a couple of centuries ago, in the Eastern \(especially the Islamic\) world, science and faith were inseparable.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Commanded by the Quran to [seek knowledge](http://www.quranreading.com/blog/importance-of-seeking-knowledge-in-islam/) and read nature for signs of the Creator, and inspired by a treasure trove of ancient Greek learning, Muslims created a society that in the Middle Ages was the [scientific center of the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/science/how-islam-won-and-lost-the-lead-in-science.html). The Arabic language was synonymous with learning and science for 500 hundred years, a golden age that can count among its credits the precursors to modern universities, algebra, the names of the stars and even the notion of science as an empirical inquiry.
1.6.4.1.1.1. Pro: [The Islamic Golden Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age) is the era in the history of Islam, traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 14th century, during which much of the historically Islamic world was ruled by various caliphates, and science, economic development and cultural works flourished.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: Islam is one of the few religions in human history in which scientific procedures are necessary for religious ritual \([Astronomy in the Service of Islam](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/science/how-islam-won-and-lost-the-lead-in-science.html), Dr. David King\).
1.6.4.1.2.1. Pro: The requirement that Muslims face in the direction of Mecca when they pray, [for example](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/30/science/how-islam-won-and-lost-the-lead-in-science.html), required knowledge of the size and shape of the Earth. The best astronomical minds of the Muslim world tackled the job of producing tables or diagrams by which the [qibla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibla), or sacred directions, could be found from any point in the Islamic world.
1.6.4.1.2.2. Pro: Arabs had always been knowledgeable about the stars and used them to navigate the desert, but Islam raised the stakes for [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world).
1.6.4.2. Con: Until a couple of centuries ago science did not challenge faith.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: When science explains a natural phenomenon, which challenges religious dogmas, prediction power proves science to be superior to religious beliefs.
1.6.4.2.2. Con: Science cannot challenge faith - only philosophical conclusions based on scientific discoveries can.
1.6.4.3. Con: Their previous coexistence in no way proves ongoing coexistence, especially as our body of scientific knowledge grows.
1.6.4.4. Con: The physical co-existence of faith and scientific skepticism as mind-states/ideals is of no bearing on the philosophical compatibility of the two.
No one argues for the compatibility of Fascism and Communism based on their co-existence in the 20th century.
1.7. Con: Faith and science both make fundamental claims about the world we live in, but use different methods for arriving at those claims. Therefore, conflict will always arise between the two.
1.7.1. Pro: Science is fact based. Faith is not.
1.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.3.4.1.
1.7.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.
1.7.3. Pro: Science and faith do not use the same acceptance criteria.
1.7.3.1. Con: Presently, members of each side have been adamant on forcing their dogma, so peaceful coexistence has not been attained. Peaceful coexistence requires both sides to respect or tolerate the other side's methods and line of thinking.
1.7.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.3.4.8.11.2.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Science uses math and observation while trying to nullify emotion. Religion does not use the same kind of logic based process, but is taken due to followers' faith in its history, its power of community, and for most peoples' emotional attachment \(many types\).
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.1.6.
1.7.4. Con: Approaching an issue by multiple methods does not prove that "conflict will always arise between" them. There exist physical phenomena which can be explained by starting with different methods but arriving at the same conclusions.
1.7.4.1. Con: The difference is the approaches must be in the same system. Religion uses faith, whereas science evidence, i.e. two different systems that are inherently incompatible.
1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.
1.7.6. Con: -> See 1.2.5.5.
1.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.
1.7.8. Con: -> See 1.5.2.3.4.
1.7.9. Con: Conflict does not imply that coexistence is impossible. Brothers can argue over the most useless of things and still end up with the same beliefs they started with.
1.7.9.1. Con: Brothers can change their opinions or, if the argument is useless, give up when they've lost interest. Religion and science are fundamentally opposed by definition, and can't just stop being opposed, nor alter their nature. Their conflict is perpetually unresolved and unable to be resolved, where the only solution is resolution.
