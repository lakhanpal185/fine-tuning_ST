Discussion Title: Is Female Education The Most Important Objective to Improve Quality of Life?

1.1. Con: Many societies do not really care about gender equality. Efforts that target female education are therefore not in line with what people consider necessary or want.
1.1.1. Con: What is considered 'necessary' or 'wanted' by some does not mean it shouldn't be a priority.
1.1.2. Con: This may be more easily established on a case by case basis then, rather than a blanket rule - it still remains true, however, that education is vital.

1.2.3. Pro: Educating girls leads to women taking control of their reproduction, reducing fertility rate, improving health outcomes of themselves and their families, alleviating poverty, and as a result reducing environmental degradation.

1.3.2. Pro: [Gross domestic product](https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/why-educating-girls-makes-economic-sense) also soars when both girls and boys are being offered educational opportunities: "a one percentage point increase in female education raises the average GDP by 0.3 percentage points and raises annual GDP growth rates by 0.2 percentage points.
1.3.3. Pro: Education leads to improved productive capacities of the labor force, meaning the country as a whole can become more productive and technologically advanced.

1.4.1. Pro: Parliaments with a higher degree of female MPs are more likely to ratify environmental treaties.
1.4.1.1. Con: This is anecdotal as high rates of female membership in governments and attention to environmental issues are both relatively recent developments in history. There isn't enough data on either issue yet to draw such a strong conclusion from the correlations.

1.7. Con: Education of both men and women will have greater effects than that of women alone. Both must play a role in improving the quality of life of all of society's members.
1.7.1. Con: True, but in parts of the earth where women generally do not receive education, it might be easier to spread the education already in place to women as well.
1.7.2. Con: The argument does not require educating women instead of men, but rather taking the education already available to men, and extending it to women as well.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
