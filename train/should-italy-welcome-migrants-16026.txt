Discussion Title: Should Italy welcome migrants?

1. Italy should welcome migrants.
1.1. Pro: Italy and most other European countries supported American aggression in Muslim countries. They must accept responsibility for what they did and take in the people who are fleeing their countries because of that.
1.2. Pro: Italy or any other western country cannot stop people from trying to enter, so they might as well welcome the newcomers so that those people actually try to integrate.
1.2.1. Con: Western countries are more than capable of keeping foreigners outside their territory. Through a combination of physical barriers, deportations, and PR campaigns dissuading people from coming. Many countries have done this.
1.3. Pro: The birth rate is falling in Italy.
1.3.1. Pro: Italy's [population](https://www.thelocal.it/20180208/italy-birthrate-lowest-ever) is older than ever before, therefore immigrants can be very beneficial.
1.4. Con: There are more and more unemployed people in Italy
1.4.1. Pro: Italy's [unemployment](https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/unemployment-rate) rate has risen in the last years.
1.5. Con: Mass immigration from Africa should increase crime and terrorism
1.5.1. Con: There is no reason why a group of people looking for better economic prospects have to necessarily be more prone to crime than locals.
1.6. Pro: The government is using migrants to promote racism and intolerance
1.6.1. Con: Migrants and refugees needs help. The fact that they are used as a political tool is reprehensible, but to let them die or starve because of it is morally worse.
1.7. Pro: International treaties oblige Italy to do it.
1.8. Con: White people should defend their identity
1.8.1. Con: There is no 'white identity' since the culture, language, religion and background of many Caucasians is very diverse.
1.8.2. Con: We are all human beings: that's our identity. To define a human being "white" or "black" or "wathever" is obsolete. Today, the mainstream belief among scientists is that race is a social construct without biological meaning.
1.8.3. Con: Skin colors don't have an identity. People have. And it is multiple.
1.8.4. Con: Anthropologists [argue](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajpa.23120) that "there are no human biological races and recognition that race exists as lived social experiences". [Population-wise](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0043759#abstract0), "there is a noticeable genetic difference between Sardinians, Northern Italians and Southern Italians", hence the concept of "white people" is arguably wrong.
1.9. Con: Many of them aren't political refugees, but are economic migrants.
1.9.1. Con: People fleeing from their countries because of war or economic hardships do so to live better lives and thus it is morally right to provide them with that possibility.
1.9.2. Con: This would pose a problem only if their average working know-how was comparable to the italian one. As a matter of fact, the average italian is more work-instructed and therefore [not likely to compete for a job](http://www.oecd.org/italy/jobs-for-immigrants-vol-4-9789264214712-en.htm) with a migrant.
1.10. Pro: Colonialist countries are the main responsible for this.
