Discussion Title: Should Countries Taking In Refugees Confiscate their Valuables?

1. Countries that accept refugees must confiscate their valuables worth more than €1500.
1.1. Con: Taking refugee's valuables makes their integration more difficult.
1.1.1. Pro: Confiscating refugees' assets and valuables worth more than €1500 makes it very hard for them to found a business or to create a new existence in general.
1.1.1.1. Pro: To apply for a job refugees would already need money to dress appropriately.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: There are business clothes for [men](http://www.c-and-a.com/de/de/shop/herren/business-mode/alle-business-artikel) and [women](http://www.c-and-a.com/de/de/shop/damen/business-mode/alle-business-mode-artikel) that do not cost a fortune.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Most clothing costs less than €1500 and thus will remain affordable.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Asylum seekers are mostly not allowed to work.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: You can buy clothing of high quality at thrift shops.
1.1.1.1.5. Con: Applicants do not need a suit and a tie for all jobs. In some cases regular clothes are ok as well.
1.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: When applying as a waitress, bartender or security guard, you most probably can wear casual clothes for the job interview.
1.1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Not standing out in a positive way \(like for example a neat outfit\) from the competitors in those branches will put the light more on likely deficits of refugees \(language problems, no references, no networks, etc.\) and reduce the chances of getting the job.
1.1.1.1.6. Con: Without speaking the language of the country they are in, applying for a job will be rare.
1.1.1.1.6.1. Con: If you do not speak the language there are still many jobs to work in.
1.1.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: There is always a significant expat community that allows to work in your mother tongue.
1.1.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: English is typically the only requirement to work in an Irish Pub.
1.1.1.1.6.2. Con: Learning the local language does not take too long. [Six months](http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20150302-secrets-to-learning-a-language) are enough to qualify for basic tasks.
1.1.1.1.6.2.1. Con: Certain languages \(such as French, Japanese, Chinese, Russian or Polish\) are very hard to learn due to a complex grammar and / or specific type of alphabet.
1.1.1.1.6.3. Con: If the domestic language of the new country is too hard to learn, one can get along with English quite well.
1.1.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.1.2.
1.1.1.2. Con: It is possible to start a business with less than [$100](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/money/10-businesses-you-can-start-with-under-100-dollars.html).
1.1.1.3. Con: Asylum seekers do get [everything they need](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2015/11/balkan-asylum-seekers-fear-deportation-germany-151105102613974.html) for daily life. So there is little chance or need to build a new existence anyway.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Asylum seekers in Germany receive free accommodation, basic healthcare and a monthly allowance of [325 Euros](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2015/11/balkan-asylum-seekers-fear-deportation-germany-151105102613974.html).
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: This does not mean that they cannot create a new existence. It is meant as a first step of help. Otherwise one could argue that Hartz-IV recipients are not able to create an existence either.
1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Although [there are \(not very likely\) possibilities](http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article123408839/Existenzgruender-bekommen-kaum-Hilfe-vom-Jobcenter.html) within Hartz-IV to start an existence, the purpose of Hartz-IV is not to boost the ability to start a new existence to live off it, but to provide a guaranteed existential minimum to secure basic "survival".
1.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: One of the most succesful German Start-ups, [Momox](http://www.webretailer.com/lean-commerce/momox/), was created out of unemployment.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: A future or perspective is needed to have a human daily life.
1.1.1.3.3. Con: In many cases security from violence is something they do not get.
1.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Camps are often under attack showing how little security refugees enjoy. \([mirror.co.uk](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/calais-migrant-camp-fire-france-6830330); [rt.com](https://www.rt.com/news/325053-arson-attack-germany-migrants/)\)
1.1.1.3.4. Con: This is a huge waste of potential talents, skills and manpower which finally results in a deficit for society.
1.1.1.3.5. Con: Most young people want to learn, work and build a new existence no matter what they receive from the government.
1.1.1.3.5.1. Pro: 70% of young Britons want to learn a foreign language. \([theguardian.com](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/07/-sp-do-young-people-care-about-learning-foreign-languages-data)\)
1.1.1.3.5.2. Pro: A British survey shows that [81%](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/aspires/ASPIRES-final-report-December-2013.pdf) of children age 10-14 want to go to university.
1.1.1.3.5.3. Con: In Germany, children are not only [less educated](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2015_eag-2015-en#page1) than their parents, but also are happy with less and [not driving for more](http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article132042821/Deutsche-Jugend-geringer-gebildet-als-die-Eltern.html).
1.1.1.4. Pro: The confiscation limits the refugees' possibilities of self-determination.
1.1.1.5. Pro: Earning acceptance, reputation and prestige within a society is often directly connected to economical success. Therefore confiscating their valuables makes this step even harder for refugees.
1.1.1.6. Pro: Parties to the Geneva Convention are encouraged in [Art. 30 \(2\)](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html) to allow asset transfers for refugee's resettlement in another country.
1.1.1.6.1. Con: Art. 30 \(2\) is just after refugee status was granted and therefore does not apply to the confiscation of valuables upon arrival.
1.1.1.7. Con: The likeliness for refugees to start an own business while being in refugee camps and awaiting the decision upon their application is very low, mostly because they just are not allowed. Thus confiscating their valuables when they register does not take any possibilities from them, because they do not have them anyway.
1.1.1.8. Con: €1500 is hardly enough to build a new existence in [Denmark](http://www.wohin-auswandern.de/wohnen-in-daenemark).
1.1.1.8.1. Con: Asylum seekers are confined to special legislation and treatment and thus cannot create a new existence.
1.1.1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.1.8.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.
1.1.1.9. Pro: Refugees get highly dependent from the public authorities.
1.1.1.9.1. Pro: Financially dependent refugees are causing permanent costs in the long run which is a deficit for society.
1.1.1.9.2. Con: Being dependent on authorities is part of the welfare regime, under which refugees and asylum seekers come.
1.1.1.9.2.1. Con: So if there are already lots of people living of welfare, the number of them only increases by the dispossessed refugees, which becomes an even larger problem for society.
1.1.1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.4.
1.1.2. Con: Refugees' [biggest obstacles](http://www.eaea.org/en/home/news/refugees-biggest-obstacles-to-integrate-are-recognition-of-qualifications-and-adequate-language-skills.html) to integrate are recognition of qualifications and adequate language skills. Taking their valuables will not make it more difficult.
1.1.3. Pro: The physical search creates a feeling of discrimination because non-refugees do not have to undergo the same procedure.
1.1.3.1. Pro: This feeling of discrimination might even degrade security for the community as a whole. [Procedural justice research suggests](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-5893.3703002/abstract;jsessionid=C437FBCBD0ACD7F9BFF34F86922F26DB.f02t02?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=) that when people perceive authorities like police behave unfairly, they are less likely to share information and cooperate with those authorities. So unfair police practices degrade fairness perceptions and thus might degrade the public good of safety for the community as a whole.
1.1.4. Pro: Refugees entering a new country are faced with overwhelming difficulties and have forfeited most of what they owned to leave a bad situation. Refugees becoming self sufficient and productive is the ultimate outcome for both the refugee and the host country. The host country will benefit more from the refugee attaining self-sufficiency as quickly as possible than what is gained by taking their possessions. Confiscating most of the refugee's possessions is counterproductive to this end.
1.1.5. Pro: Just as any dispossessed persons, refugees or newcomers are likely to feel treated unfairly which leads to a menace for social peace.
1.1.5.1. Con: Unless you assume something with "cultural mannerisms" refugees and newcomers are not more likely to feel treated unfair than anybody living under certain conditions off the welfare state, for example Hartz - IV.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: People living under Hartz - IV can choose to apply for it or not. Furthermore they are not getting dispossessed. Refugees do not have this option, the only one is to return to their home countries.
1.2. Con: Exercising the right to asylum must not be tied to expenses.
1.2.1. Pro: It is a basic right of the individual and thus supposed to be free.
1.2.1.1. Con: Even basic rights can be limited under certain circumstances.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: There are rights that cannot be limited, e.g. [torture prohibition](https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/03/11/legal-prohibition-against-torture#permitted) or the [right to have rights](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=2918840).
1.2.1.2. Con: Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution." The article and other international law says nothing about the right must be without a reasonable fee.
1.3. Con: Confiscating valuables from refugees is a very aggressive measure and not easily compatible with a constitutional state and/or free market economy. There must be less absolutist ways to have refugees contribute to the state.
1.3.1. Pro: Rather than confiscating valuables, refugees entering a country should have to declare the worth of their belongings and funds. This declaration should then be used as a basis to calculate how and to which amount the state will financially support the individual refugee.
1.3.2. Pro: Instead of conficating valuables the state could approach refugees similar to recipients of social perfomance \(e.g. Hartz IV\). The state only steps in with financial support, when reserve assets have been spent.
1.3.2.1. Con: Keeping track of each refugee's financial situation, as an alternative approach, would overburden the already strained administration.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Refugees are already part of the welfare system, thus their income situation is pretty clear to those, who are consulting them on the administrational side. Thus keeping further track after a first "tabula rasa" would not put that much extra workload on the administration as they already were given.
1.3.3. Pro: As the right to property is one of the basic rights in most constitutional states with a free market economy, compulsory confiscations should only be allowed in exceptional cases.
1.3.4. Pro: One of the main duties of a modern democratic state is to provide and protect the right of property. The suggested confiscation violates that important right.
1.3.4.1. Con: Interference with the [right to property](http://www.echr.coe.int/LibraryDocs/DG2/HRHAND/DG2-EN-HRHAND-04%282003%29.pdf) can be justified due to reasons such as public or general interest, taxing measures, compensation, etc.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: [Citizens' properties](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34422558) have been confiscated by the state to provide places for refugees to stay for. Thus it should also be okay for the state to confiscate valuables from refugees.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Only not used commercial properties \(empty houses\) have been confiscated by the state to make use out of them. Thus it is not comparable with the only valuables a refugee owns.
1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Empty houses are still someone's property. If the owner is known there should not be right to confiscated it.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: All citizens pay taxes.
1.3.4.2. Con: Refugees are other states' citizens and therefore not in the scope of protection concerning their properties.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Refugees are natural persons and thus entitled to the protection of [property](http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/incorporated-rights/articles-index/protocol-1-article-1/).
1.3.4.2.2. Con: If one state fails to protect their citizens it is the duty of another state to step in and do the job others have failed to do.
1.3.4.2.2.1. Con: R2P deals exclusively with [domestic protection](http://www.who.int/hiv/universalaccess2010/worldsummit.pdf); not with protection once a citizen leaves the country. This mostly excludes refugees.
1.3.4.2.2.2. Con: R2P requires a [prior authorisation](http://www.who.int/hiv/universalaccess2010/worldsummit.pdf) by the UN Security Council. Refugees rarely fall within this scope.
1.3.4.2.3. Con: In democratic societies individual rights apply to every human in the country, regardless of their nationality.
1.3.4.2.3.1. Con: Foreign property in a country is treated differently from domestic property in [international customary law](http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2935&context=bclr).
1.3.4.2.3.1.1. Pro: It is needed to keep outside investment protected.
1.3.4.2.3.1.2. Con: In the absence of a treaty the non-discrimination principle [prevails](http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2935&context=bclr).
1.3.4.2.3.2. Con: [Art 13](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html) of the Geneva Convention does not give refugees a right to property equal with nationals but only with "aliens generally in the same circumstances".
1.3.4.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.3.2.
1.3.4.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.1.
1.3.4.4. Pro: Valuables of refugees were often taxed in their country of origin and thus it would create a type of double taxation.
1.3.4.5. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.3.2.
1.3.4.6. Con: Redistribution of wealth to ease differences is a generally accepted practice.
1.3.4.6.1. Con: Countries do not take away from the rich but from everyone. All citizens pay taxes to support the people who cannot \(anymore\) finance themselves.
1.3.4.6.1.1. Con: Tax levels are different depending on wealth. Thus not all citizens pay equal taxes.
1.3.4.6.1.2. Con: At the same tax rate a rich person pays more taxes than a poor person due to a higher tax base.
1.3.4.6.2. Con: It is not normal to take from the rich and give to the poor. In general, everyone pays to the welfare system in proportion to their earnings/possessions.
1.3.4.7. Pro: Refugees have problems of proving ownership of their valuables and thus enjoy special protection of property rights.
1.3.4.7.1. Pro: In other areas of [property rights protection](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/pinheiro_principles.pdf), such as restitution, refugees do enjoy special rights as well. Thus, it is likely that the same applies to carried valuables.
1.3.4.8. Con: The Geneva Convention in [Art 29 \(2\)](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html) clearly allows to impose charges to cover administrative procedures.
1.3.4.8.1. Con: If this is about covering administrative procedure costs, then the fee should be standardized rather than scaled according to what refugees are carrying.
1.3.4.9. Con: While native citizens have been paying taxes in the country for their whole life, the new arriving refugees have not. It is unlikely that any refugees can contribute an amount commensurate with what a citizen of their age would have contributed over a lifetime, so this is the next best possible way for them to contribute fairly to the services they will access.
1.3.4.9.1. Pro: It is a major principle of the Geneva Refugee Convention in chapter IV that refugees are [treated the same](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html) as national citizens.
1.3.4.9.2. Pro: Security is not a free good accessible for everybody. It costs a lot of money and everybody has to pay his/her contribution.
1.3.4.9.3. Con: Refugees pay taxes as well, e.g. in form of added value tax when purchasing food or clothing.
1.3.4.9.3.1. Pro: When buying expensive goods or bringing their valuables with them, wealthy refugees contribute a lot to the economy and society.
1.3.4.9.4. Con: States are obliged to take in refugees under the [Geneva Convention](http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html) without return payment.
1.3.4.9.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.3.2.
1.3.4.9.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.8.
1.3.4.9.5. Pro: It follows the guiding principle of the welfare state that you support yourself when you are able to do so.
1.3.4.9.5.1. Con: As the status "refugee" already suggests, self-support is not possible for a refugee, because he/she is not under the protection of his/her home state. That is precisely why the asylum state is obliged to support the refugee.
1.3.4.9.5.1.1. Con: Refugees and asylum-seekers are unable to legally work while states are processing their applications. So it is unfair to them to say that they are a drain and states are obligated to support them—when at the same time it is actually those same states that keep them from legally working.
1.3.4.9.5.2. Pro: Germans that receive unemployment benefits have to use up their money too until they can get it.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1. Con: One cannot compare the condition of a refugee, who has fled his/her home country due to war or other life-threatening reasons, to the condition of a citizen of a safe, democratic country.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.9.5.1.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.2. Con: As soon as the refugee is in his or her new host country you can compare their situation, at least financially.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3. Pro: Refugees often have no choice to flee their home country with all their wealth while unemployed have had the chance.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: People living in the EU have all possibilities to become successful \(compared to the regions refugees are fleeing from\). If they stay broke and unsuccessful it is their fault and no money needs to be spent on those who just failed.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1.1. Con: The sources of individual poverty are irrelevant to see that it is unfair when rich refugees get resources while domestic poor people do not get them.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.9.3.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Countries like Romania and Bulgaria do not offer a lot of possibilities to people born in poverty.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Still, they offer more possibilities for people than war-torn countries like Syria, Libya or Iraq.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: While in countries such as Syria, Libya or Iraq most people have similar opportunities, possibilities in Romania or Bulgaria depend on your ethnicity alone.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: In countries such as Syria, Libya or Iraq people do not have similar opportunities if they belong to the "wrong" sub-religious group \(in some cases Shiites, in some cases Sunni, in some cases Kurds, ....\).
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Romania has a lot of rich ethnics and poor natives. Opportunities are based on context, not necessary one's ethnic one, like in every society.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: They offer hardly anything to Sinti and Roma.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Romania [discriminates](http://cms.horus.be/files/99935/MediaArchive/national/Romania%20-%20SR%202008.pdf) Roma in the educational system.
1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: [Bulgarian Roma](http://hudoc.ecri.coe.int/XMLEcri/ENGLISH/Cycle_03/03_CbC_eng/BGR-CbC-III-2004-2-ENG.pdf) encounter serious difficulties in many spheres of life.
1.3.4.9.5.3. Con: Some models of the welfare state \(e.g., Milton Friedman's [negative income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax) and F.A. Hayek's [minimum income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_minimum_income)\) do not create and police categories of poor, disabled, and old people to dole out different forms of assistance. Rather, they save on administrative infrastructure, costs, and discretionary power by seeking to ensure that everyone has access to enough resources to live.
1.3.4.9.6. Con: [Nearly 90,000](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/nearly-90000-unaccompanied-minors-sought-asylum-in-eu-in-2015-a7010976.html) or [more than one third](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-crisis-children-make-up-more-than-a-third-of-arrivals-and-more-than-ever-are-making-deadly-a7052911.html) of arrivals are children. Children have not paid taxes in their countries of origin, so this argument is inapplicable to a large subset of the relevant refugees.
1.3.4.9.7. Con: Wealthier refugees, say with confiscated valuables above €1 million, would suffer disproportionate costs.
1.3.4.9.8. Con: Asylum only requires the personal assessment of the individual applying to confirm his right to asylum \(e.g. political persecution\) and not an entrance fee.
1.3.4.9.8.1. Con: Asylum considerations are not affected
1.3.4.9.8.1.1. Con: If one would refuse to be searched and have his valuables confiscated that would obligatorily lead to a denial of that persons request. Otherwise due to logic it would just not work.
1.3.4.9.8.2. Con: It is not applicable to all refugees entering and thus not an entrance fee.
1.3.4.9.9. Con: Native citizens paid taxes while working in their home country. This is something different.
1.3.4.9.9.1. Pro: Refugees are not allowed to work as long as their legal status is pending.
1.3.4.9.10. Con: When paying taxes, only a part of the income is being taken away. When taking money from refugees, everything is taken away.
1.3.4.9.10.1. Con: They can keep anything up to €1500.
1.3.4.10. Pro: Confiscation is  a form of dehumanization and of stealing someone's property.
1.3.4.10.1. Con: In criminal proceedings, property can be confiscated by the state. In this case, for example, [Bitcoins worth £50,000](https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3029619/paypal-fraudsters-gbp50-000-in-bitcoins-seized-on-proceeds-of-crime-confiscation) were confiscated.
1.3.4.10.2. Con: Guns can be confiscated by the police, for example in cases of [domestic violence](http://www.preventdvgunviolence.org/assets/documents/legal-landscape/police-seizure-of-firearms-at-scenes-of-domestic-violence.pdf). Clearly, not all confiscations dehumanize the person.
1.3.5. Con: Confiscation is a very selective practice. Because most refugees do not own more than €1500 this targets only a limited number. Alternatives would target more people.
1.3.6. Pro: This would also mean confiscating valuables of high sentimental value like inherited jewellery. Taking away memories of beloved family members is inhumane.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Jewellery may be the only thing that reminds them of their families and their homes, as it would be too hard to flee with heavier stuff like paintings or photo albums.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: Pictures are easy to take or can be stored online.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: Paintings can be physically taken when fleeing.
1.3.6.2. Con: It is easy to include safeguards that exempt things the refugee is dependent upon both physically or emotionally.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: The Danish officials for example refrain from taking away valuables that have a [sentimental value](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/01/danish-mps-vote-seizing-valuables-refugees-160126055035636.html).
1.3.6.2.2. Pro: Nowhere they require refugees to hand over golden teeth or prosthesis.
1.3.6.2.2.1. Con: Those things cannot be asked for, because they serve a special medical purpose.
1.3.6.2.2.1.1. Con: Gold teeth could be removed and sold; from the money they get they could get new cheaper fillings / tooth of other material. That way they would also support the local dental technology and contribute right away to the society they wish to become part of.
1.3.6.3. Pro: Considering the wounds a confiscation may leave, it is not proportional to confiscate sentimental valuables.
1.3.6.4. Con: Jewellery has often been used in families in order to be financially covered in bad times. Being in a war and fleeing to another country is definitive a bad time, thus it makes total sense to give it away and be protected at the same time.
1.3.6.5. Con: Granting asylum for people searching for security and safety is humane. As everything in life this comes with a cost, if it means letting go of inherited jewelry then it is that way. The alternative is either returning where one came from or even not trying to seek refuge in countries with terms for getting asylum.
1.3.6.5.1. Con: The majority of refugees cannot return where they came from.
1.3.6.5.1.1. Con: If they do not accept given procedural standards, then they have to be sent back or at least denied entry to the country and brought back to the border.
1.3.6.5.1.1.1. Con: Deporting refugees is often not possible even though the application was dismissed.
1.3.6.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: There is hardly a chance to be deported to [Afghanistan](http://www.dw.com/en/afghanistans-minister-of-refugees-no-agreement-on-taking-back-deportees-from-germany/a-19020715) because their safety cannot be guaranteed there.
1.3.6.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: Source countries can refuse to accept [forced deportees](http://www.dw.com/en/afghanistans-minister-of-refugees-no-agreement-on-taking-back-deportees-from-germany/a-19020715).
1.3.6.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: Source countries want [safeguards](http://www.dw.com/en/germany-plans-to-accelerate-deportation-of-algerians-moroccans/a-18985272) before accepting deportees.
1.3.6.5.1.1.2. Con: Applicants often [destroy their passport](http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/7342/germany-migrant-deportation) intentionally and are not rejected for not conforming to the rules.
1.3.6.5.1.1.3. Con: Rejected cases are rarely deported.
1.3.6.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: In 2015, of 5,500 rejected asylum applications from Moroccans and Algerians in Germany in the first half of last year, [only 53](http://www.dw.com/en/germany-plans-to-accelerate-deportation-of-algerians-moroccans/a-18985272) were deported.
1.3.6.5.1.1.3.2. Pro: In 2014 the EU as a whole deported only 862 individuals to destinations outside Europe. It is thus unlikely to be sent back either way. \([zeit.de](http://www.zeit.de/feature/deportation-refugees-flights-frontex)\)
1.3.6.5.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: In 2014, only 222 refugees have been sent back to countries outside Europe by plane. \([zeit.de](http://www.zeit.de/feature/refugees-in-germany-deportation-flights-laws)\)
1.3.6.5.1.1.3.3. Pro: The Netherlands stopped deporting [Angolans](https://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/policy_and_research/gcim/gmp/gmp34.pdf) between 1998 and 2001 due to the conditions there.
1.3.6.5.1.1.4. Pro: Denial of entry or getting sent back is the logical step for people not applying for asylum in the correct, bureaucratic form with the acceptance of all measures connected to this process.
1.3.6.5.1.2. Con: Iraqi Refugees leaving Germany and returning home because they got [disillusioned](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2016/01/28/why-iraqi-refugees-in-germany-are-choosing-to-head-home.html) by the conditions and possibilities in Germany.
1.3.6.5.1.3. Con: Wealthy refugees have more than one choice and thus have the possibility to select a country of their choice.
1.3.6.5.1.3.1. Pro: For wealthy refugees [investment visas](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3d36db18-9fc3-11e3-b6c7-00144feab7de.html) offer a possibility to circumvent this provision and safeguard their assets.
1.3.6.5.2. Pro: Asylum applications that do not conform to the rules will be rejected and the applicant deported. It is the bureaucratic process in those cases.
1.3.6.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.5.1.1.1.
1.3.6.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.6.5.1.1.2.
1.3.6.5.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.6.5.1.1.3.
1.4. Pro: Taking away valuables from refugees is necessary for the state to generate easy and fast income.
1.4.1. Con: Because there are only few refugees that have more than €1500 the effects will be negligible.
1.4.1.1. Pro: A majority of refugees possess [less than €1500](http://www.vice.com/read/denmark-refugees-possessions-photos-876) and thus only special cases will be affected.
1.4.2. Con: Taking their money means they cannot spent it in that country. It would have a positive effect on the country's economy if they would be able to spend it.
1.4.2.1. Con: If the money is taken away by a country, it is spent the most "in the country" way possible.
1.4.3. Con: Implementing such policies renders seeking refuge in countries with this policy more attractive to impoverished refugees than wealthy ones. These refugees are more likely to be uneducated ones, because the well-educated ones will look for countries where they can keep their money.
1.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.6.5.1.3.1.
1.4.3.3. Con: Refugees follow other more important considerations than wealth calculations when choosing a destination.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: Well educated people will go to the country that offers the best opportunities in education and employment because they calculate on their own and their childrens' chances in future.
1.4.3.3.1.1. Pro: Well educated people look for a long-term solution, not for a short period of wealth.
1.4.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Humans do not want to wait for better times. They want to have a good life [immediately](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference).
1.4.3.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Gains in better life are more discounted than potential losses and therefore humans want the gains [now](http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/loewenstein/TimeDiscounting.pdf).
1.4.3.3.1.2. Con: As many refugees plan on moving back to their home country as soon as they can they do not need to care about their future in a host country.
1.4.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: Because the costs of fleeing to a closer destination and return from it are cheaper than far destinations, most refugees that settle in the vicinity of a conflict are more likely to return.
1.4.3.3.1.2.2. Con: Causes of migration and flight are protracted. Therefore, refugees have to care about their mid-range future in the host country.
1.4.3.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Climate change as a cause for flight and migration is not easily resolved in the short term, thus making a quick return less likely.
1.4.3.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: Civil Wars typically last several years, thus making a quick return less likely.
1.4.3.3.1.2.2.3. Pro: The economic situation in home countries does not change in a couple of years, thus making a quick return less likely.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: Traditional [colonial ties](https://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/policy_and_research/gcim/gmp/gmp34.pdf) are a major driver for refugee patterns.
1.4.3.3.3. Pro: Being able to speak the language is important both for work and integration and thus is a [major factor](https://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/policy_and_research/gcim/gmp/gmp34.pdf) in destination selection.
1.4.3.3.4. Pro: Having relatives or a sizeable expat community in a certain target country is often more important than wealth considerations.
1.4.3.3.4.1. Pro: More than [90%](https://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/policy_and_research/gcim/gmp/gmp34.pdf) of asylum applications from Vietnamese in the EU were filed in Germany in 2001. This indicates that established networks between source and destination country strongly influence destination choices.
1.4.3.3.4.2. Pro: [Social networks](https://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/policy_and_research/gcim/gmp/gmp34.pdf) in a destination country can guide the initial flight, because it provides for local information and experience.
1.4.3.3.4.3. Pro: The reputation rather than the reality of a country can attract refugees.
1.4.3.3.5. Pro: [Agents](https://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/policy_and_research/gcim/gmp/gmp34.pdf) are extremely important and often decide the destination country on behalf of the refugee.
1.4.3.3.6. Pro: Saudi Arabia or the UAE offer good economic opportunities but are [not preferred](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-34116381) destination countries.
1.4.3.3.6.1. Con: There are around [500.000](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anhvinh-doanvo/europes-crisis-refugees_b_8175924.html) refugees in Saudi Arabia.
1.4.3.4. Pro: In the long run it will become more expensive because poor and uneducated people not only do not provide enough productivity towards a society, but are also more likely to become sick and that will lead to higher health care costs, carried by the society as well. [\(telegraph.co.uk\)](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/12064058/Poor-and-uneducated-are-biologically-different-to-affluent-UCL-finds.html)
1.4.4. Pro: It helps financing the application procedure.
1.4.4.1. Con: Physically searching refugees is more costly for the police than the rewards.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: The rewards of physically searching refugees, especially those from conflict areas like the Islamic State where people may have been radicalized against the West, might extend beyond the value of confiscated possessions. Physical pat-downs might also enhance public safety.
1.4.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.8.
1.4.5. Con: Social policy depends little on what are the easiest and fastest ways for the state to make money. If it did, then one would expect to see a comparative cost-benefits analysis of other such policies. Probably legalizing and taxing drugs, sex, organ sales, and the market for healthy white babies would generate a lot more income at less cost than confiscating refugees' wedding bands.
1.4.6. Pro: This could be a small step towards a balanced national budget.
1.4.6.1. Con: Refugees are people in need. It is unethical in a [Kantian sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_to_an_end) and illegal under [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) for a state to use human beings, especially particularly vulnerable human beings who generally have little remaining wealth to extract in the first place, to better balance their budgets. People are ends unto themselves, not means to an end.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: Among domestic citizens are people in need as well \(homeless, poor, old, sick, etc.\). Cutting social expenditure to fund other branches of governments is part of politics. Thus no exception for refugees needs to be made.
1.4.6.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.5. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.6. Con: Confiscating refugees' valuables will lead to a bad international reputation as can be seen in recent articles [recent](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/denmark-refugees-immigration-law/431520/) [articles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/01/26/denmark-passes-controversial-bill-to-seize-assets-and-valuables-from-refugees/) [about](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/27/denmark-selfish-global-refugee-crisis-immigration) [Denmark's](http://www.wsj.com/articles/denmark-pulls-back-on-welcome-mat-for-refugees-1453844339) new bill.
1.6.1. Con: Laws should not be made in regards to how they will affect a country's reputation. Laws should be made in regards to necessity.
1.6.1.1. Con: A country's reputation is an important source of [soft power](http://www.amazon.com/The-Future-Power-Joseph-Nye/dp/1610390695) and should not be disregarded.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Germans' reputation of being hard-working and effective attracts international business-partners and investors.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Berlin's reputation as notorious party capital attracts dozens of tourists that spend a lot of money while there.
1.6.2. Pro: Public diplomacy is an important endeavor for which countries spend a lot of money. The negative effects of confiscating refugees' valuables is an obstacle to this endeavor.
1.6.2.1. Pro: States make use of [public diplomacy](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01636608509450301) to directly communicate with foreign peoples, with the aim of affecting their thinking and, ultimately, of their governments.
1.6.2.2. Pro: States make use of domestic [non-state actors](https://kadirayhan.wordpress.com/2015/07/24/why-do-we-need-non-state-actors-in-public-diplomacy-theoretical-discussion-of-relational-networked-and-collaborative-public-diplomacy/) to influence the public abroad.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: States sponsor culture institutes to spread language, culture, and knowledge on the globe.
1.6.2.2.1.1. Pro: The [Goethe Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethe-Institut) has offices around the world and is mainly funded by the German government.
1.6.2.2.1.2. Pro: The [Instituto Cervantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Cervantes) is primary funded by the Spanish government to spread Spanish culture.
1.6.2.2.1.3. Pro: The Chinese government inspired by the tactics of European countries established the [Confucius Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius_Institute) in 2004.
1.6.2.2.1.4. Pro: The [British Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Council) has been operating since 1934 and has been succesful in collecting local informations abroad that were used during World War II.
1.6.2.2.1.5. Pro: The Visegrad countries make tailored use of non-state actors in Korea to promote investment and tourism.
1.6.2.2.1.5.1. Pro: The Czech Republic engages with the Praha Restaurant in Seoul to host exhibitions.
1.6.2.2.1.5.2. Pro: The Czech EU Presidency 2009 was able [to broker agreement](http://www.mzv.cz/seoul/en/news_and_activities/seoul_deal_reached_under_local_czech_eu.html) among Korean based EU member state promotion agencies to form the Korean division of the European Union National Institute of Culture.
1.6.2.2.1.5.3. Pro: The Czech Republic is funding travel TV shows in [Korea](http://www.czechtourism.com/Czechtourism/media/CzT-Media/1-brochures/en/report2013/index.html#/28/zoomed).
1.6.3. Con: Other countries are doing the same and did not receive negative coverage, suggesting that the confiscation itself was not the cause.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Germany partly did it and was not criticized internationally.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Germany is [hailed](http://www.worldcrunch.com/rss/world-affairs/auschwitz-survivor-hails-germany-s-heroic-stand-on-migrants/c1s20543/) for its refugee policy; not criticized.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: In the beginning of 2016 there is [mild critizism](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/refugee-crisis-germany-follows-denmark-seizes-jewellery-valuables-refugees-1539381) against the German practice.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Denmark has a track record of refugee related topics, which gives special salience to Danish immigration laws worldwide.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: The Mohammed cartoons made Denmark famous for its opposition to radical Islam.
1.6.3.2.2. Pro: The international advertisements to discourage refugees coming to Denmark have been [internationally criticized](http://inserbia.info/today/2015/07/denmark-set-to-run-anti-refugee-newspaper-ads/).
1.6.4. Con: Denmark remained among the Top 10 [most reputable](http://www.reputationinstitute.com/research/Country-RepTrak) countries in 2015. This suggests that the overall negative impacts are small.
1.6.5. Pro: A good international reputation leads to more representation in international organizations.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Angela Merkel is traded as a likely [successor](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/15/opinion/why-angela-merkel-could-lead-the-un.html?_r=0) to Ban Ki-moon as UN Secretary General.
1.6.6. Con: Australia is getting bad reputation for their refugee politics sending boats back to Southeast Asian countries, but they do not seem to suffer from this bad reputation.
1.6.6.1. Con: A bad reputation always results in some kind of negative consequences.
1.6.6.1.1. Pro: People do not want to travel to countries that they think of as cruel and inhumane.
1.6.6.1.1.1. Con: Although being a military dictatorship for decades, Egypt was pretty popular with tourists from all around the world.
1.6.6.1.2. Pro: People do not want to trade with countries that they think of as cruel and inhumane.
1.6.6.1.2.1. Pro: As can be seen in recent discussions about trading with Saudi-Arabia.
1.6.6.1.2.1.1. Con: The discussions regarding Saudi-Arabia are only regarding heavy weaponary in particular, but not trading in general. And even regarding weapons the trade will not be stopped completely as the economic gains are just too huge.
1.6.6.1.2.2. Con: The US did not really seem to suffer trade-wise although their cruelties in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib were known.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1. Con: The US' picture in the world has not changed into cruel and inhumane after Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The [budget crisis](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/15/americans-need-discover-how-world-sees-them), not prisons, has undermined the US reputation in the world.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.2. Con: After Abu Graibh, between 2003 and 2004, the reputation of the US deteriorated significantly in Western Europe. \([time.com](http://time.com/3013299/america-approval/#y2003t2004)\)
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: At the same time however, the [US reputation rose](http://time.com/3013299/america-approval/#y2003t2004) in Russia and Turkey.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: The US is generally regarded as [favorable](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/1-americas-global-image/), not cruel, around the world.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.4. Pro: That 50% of global publics regard the US' torture tactics as 'unjustified' did not change the picture that 69% regard the US as 'favorable'. \([pewglobal.org](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/global-publics-back-u-s-on-fighting-isis-but-are-critical-of-post-911-torture/)\)
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.5. Pro: By all major trading economies the US is seen as [more favorable](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/global-publics-back-u-s-on-fighting-isis-but-are-critical-of-post-911-torture/) than China.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.6. Pro: Since 2002 US favorability has [not decreased](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/1-americas-global-image/) around the world even though many disapprove of US interrogation methods.
1.6.6.1.2.2.1.7. Pro: [US favorability](http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/23/global-publics-back-u-s-on-fighting-isis-but-are-critical-of-post-911-torture/) is more a reflection of geopolitical considerations.
1.6.6.1.3. Con: A bad reputation reduces constraints on a country because they cut social obligations to a community of states.
1.6.6.1.3.1. Pro: Countries with very bad reputation do not have problems violating international law.
1.6.6.1.3.1.1. Pro: It is easy for North Korea to violate international human rights, defy the Security Council and kidnap foreign citizens.
1.6.6.1.3.2. Pro: Having a bad reputation with your counterpart allows to impose more stringent and aggressive policies.
1.6.6.1.3.2.1. Pro: Because the US has not had a high reputation in Iran it did not need to care about the loss of popularity when imposing economic sanctions.
1.6.6.1.4. Con: A bad reputation can be used to achieve policy objectives.
1.6.6.1.4.1. Pro: Bismarck played on the bad Prussian reputation among the French to [trick them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War#Causes) into a war that unified Germany 1870.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.8. Con: The EU is wealthy enough to host refugees without taking away their posessions.
1.8.1. Con: The Eurozone is still struggling with the consequences of the heavy [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_debt_crisis) \(debt crisis\) which started in 2009.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Greece for example is not even capable of supporting their own poor and elderly.
1.8.2. Con: The EU is not wealthy enough to give resources to refugees who can support themselves financially.
1.8.2.1. Con: Those refugees cannot support themselves financially if their valuables above €1500 are confiscated.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Many in the EU do not get resources even though they would really need them, e.g. [people in poverty](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/People_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion). Giving these resources to refugees that can sustain themselves is unfair.
1.8.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.2.1.
1.8.2.2.2. Con: You are not giving resources to refugees, but taking away resources from them.
1.8.2.2.2.1. Pro: Morally, that is a difference, especially if valuables like jewellery would be included.
1.8.2.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.6.
1.8.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.9.5.2.1.3.1.
1.8.2.2.4. Pro: Unfortunately this view is also shared by people from wealthier countries. Giving resources to refugees instead to their own homeless people can be regarded as unfair.
1.8.3. Con: Europe carries great responsibility already with its wealth. Additional burdens would be unacceptable.
1.8.3.1. Pro: The EU is supporting poor countries substantially already.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: The EU umbrella organisation for [aid and relief NGO](http://www.concordeurope.org/financing-development/aid/item/133-eu-aid-the-facts)s finds aid given by the European Commission to be generally positive across the board, including transparency, amount and effectiveness.
1.8.3.1.2. Pro: The EU alone \(not even included individual member states\) is the [biggest donor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governments_by_development_aid) of ODA.
1.8.3.1.2.1. Pro: In Europe, the provision of [ODA/GDP](http://www.compareyourcountry.org/aid-statistics?cr=oecd&lg=en#) is highest among the world.
1.8.3.1.2.2. Con: ODA is an inappropriate way of helping poor countries.
1.8.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: A country, used to receiving ODA, may be perpetually bound to depend on handouts.
1.8.3.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Government structures adapt to handle and distribute incoming ODA. As these agents are very strong depending on the amount of ODA they have vested bureaucratic interest to remain bound to aid.
1.8.3.1.2.2.2. Con: Many countries have benefited from ODA in their development
1.8.3.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: South Korea has transformed from an ODA recipient to an ODA donor
1.8.3.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: The Marshall Plan can be understood as ODA and was extremely successful in Western Europe.
1.8.3.1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: The Marshall Plan was no ODA as it came accompanied by US military troops that stayed. They have been critical in democratization and safeguarding a beneficial business environment, allowing for economic development.
1.8.3.1.2.2.3. Con: ODA can relieve suffering in case of natural disasters
1.8.3.1.2.2.4. Pro: ODA is ineffective because it leads to [fungibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility) of regular budget.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5. Pro: ODA conditionality is reducing effectiveness of development aid.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.1. Con: Conditionality is a [safeguard](http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.4324/9780203446539.ch1) against default by the borrower.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.2. Con: Conditionality is preventing [donor fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donor_fatigue).
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.3. Con: ODA conditionality is a safeguard against [moral hazard](http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.4324/9780203446539.ch1) by the recipient government.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.4. Con: Condititonality reduces corruption within the recipient government.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.5. Pro: Effects of ODA condititonality are mixed at best.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.5.1. Pro: Poor countries are often unable to implement policies attached to condititonality.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.5.2. Pro: Macro-economic targets, e.g. inflation or debt level, are typically [not conducive to growth](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=rCO0RXzhW48C&pg=PT419&lpg=PT419&dq=riddell+assessing+impact+aid+conditionality&source=bl&ots=L7FshFRMbv&sig=kcn4vz9lVCYjeGAYc9QVZy9cYxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHv6ufkrLLAhVH5KYKHTdMB9UQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.5.3. Pro: Conditionality targets were generally made based on [overestimated growth rates](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=rCO0RXzhW48C&pg=PT419&lpg=PT419&dq=riddell+assessing+impact+aid+conditionality&source=bl&ots=L7FshFRMbv&sig=kcn4vz9lVCYjeGAYc9QVZy9cYxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHv6ufkrLLAhVH5KYKHTdMB9UQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false) while underestimating external shocks.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.5.4. Pro: Effects of trade liberalization and privatization have often led to [reduced efficiency](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=rCO0RXzhW48C&pg=PT419&lpg=PT419&dq=riddell+assessing+impact+aid+conditionality&source=bl&ots=L7FshFRMbv&sig=kcn4vz9lVCYjeGAYc9QVZy9cYxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHv6ufkrLLAhVH5KYKHTdMB9UQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false), especially in public utilities.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.5.5. Pro: Condititionality neglects the effects of policy reform on the [poor](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=rCO0RXzhW48C&pg=PT419&lpg=PT419&dq=riddell+assessing+impact+aid+conditionality&source=bl&ots=L7FshFRMbv&sig=kcn4vz9lVCYjeGAYc9QVZy9cYxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHv6ufkrLLAhVH5KYKHTdMB9UQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.5.6. Con: Conditions and funds can be used as a [political resource](http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.4324/9780203446539.ch1) by reformers and thus increase the chances of reform.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.5.7. Con: Conditionality creates greater [consistency](http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.4324/9780203446539.ch1) over time.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.5.8. Con: Institutions demanding conditions can be used as [scapegoats](http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.4324/9780203446539.ch1) for reform.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.6. Pro: Assessment of what constitutes 'good governance' as condition is highly arbitrary.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.6.1. Pro: The World Bank's [CPIA Index](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/CPIA) is made by individual discretion with little oversight and methodological problems. This leads to [high fluctuations](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=rCO0RXzhW48C&pg=PT419&lpg=PT419&dq=riddell+assessing+impact+aid+conditionality&source=bl&ots=L7FshFRMbv&sig=kcn4vz9lVCYjeGAYc9QVZy9cYxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHv6ufkrLLAhVH5KYKHTdMB9UQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q=riddell%20assessing%20impact%20aid%20conditionality&f=false).
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.7. Con: [Less state control](http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.4324/9780203446539.ch1) of the economy is leading to a more efficient public sector and mobilizes domestic resources leading to growth.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.8. Con: Conditionality is a [force majeur](http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.4324/9780203446539.ch1) that results from the power differentials between those who have resource and those who do not.
1.8.3.1.2.2.5.9. Pro: As the [average number of conditions](http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.4324/9780203446539.ch1) per World Bank adjustment loan increased from 39 to 56 between 1980 and 1990.
1.8.3.1.3. Pro: The EU is joining in the general criticism of the existing international order and aims at strengthening UN organizations vis-a-vis Bretton Woods organization in the context of sustainable development. [Most recent UN meeting discussing good governance and SDGs \(23.9\)](http://webtv.un.org/watch/panel-discussion-on-human-rights-based-approach-to-good-governance-23rd-meeting-30th-regular-session-of-human-rights-council/4505293520001)
1.8.3.1.4. Pro: The EU favors least-developed countries through the [Everything but Arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_but_Arms) initiative that scraps unilaterally customs to the EU and therewith strengthens domestic economies in poor countries.
1.8.3.1.5. Pro: The EU and its Member States are directly providing support to local NGOs in the Global South, for example [Environment Development Action in the Third World](http://endatiersmonde.org/instit/)
1.8.3.1.6. Con: The EU is doing much harm to poor countries and thus cannot escape responsibility.
1.8.3.1.7. Con: The EU carries a historical responsibility for poor countries.
1.8.3.1.7.1. Pro: Europe exploited poor countries to develop. Now is the time to return this borrowed resources.
1.8.3.1.7.1.1. Pro: Colonies have provided material benefits to the citizens of Europe.
1.8.3.1.7.1.1.1. Con: Products produced in former colonies are still available.
1.8.3.1.7.1.1.2. Con: Cheap labor from migrant workers is still available.
1.8.3.1.7.1.1.3. Pro: The real-world manifestations of white supremacy of the world are not apparent any more.
1.8.3.1.7.2. Pro: The image of white man superiority casts a lasting shadow that needs resources to resolve.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1. Pro: The dominance of white men in world affairs was and is felt across the world.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: The idea of white superiority has led to racism and violence against non-whites all across Europe.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: The idea of supremacy comes from life itself. According to evolution those survive who are able to adapt best to their surroundings, thus they are able to reign supreme. Racism and violence thus come by natural, because somebody will have supremacy, regardless of it now being white supremacy.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no need for supremacy. A society can function through cooperation and specialization just like family members can specialize and live without supremacy of a certain person.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In some cultures, even in families there is a certain form of supremacy, the patriarchy or matriarchy, in which either a strong father or mother is "reigning" the family.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The first "scientific investigation" of those structures \(the credit would go to Aristotle in this one\) of family and their integration in society puts the man of the house \(the chief of the family\) in charge of the others, thus a superior position lies within the family structure.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: In [Afghanistan](http://outlookafghanistan.net/topics.php?post_id=13129) patriarchy as a form of family organization does still exist.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.2. Pro: It makes minorities look like weak targets that can be threatened without repercussions.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Police thinks minorities are more often the perpetrator and thus have a [bias](https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/press-releases/new-evidence-reveals-police-europe-target-minorities-excessively) to investigating crimes against minorities.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.3. Pro: Whit people have more ressources they can use in a violent fashion.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: There is a wealth [gap](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp1302.pdf?3ca32a0093002d235da418edbd284e0d) between native borns and migrants in many European countries.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Physical violence is generally negatively related to wealth. Thus, if white people have more ressources they are less violent.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Violence [results](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120417221611.htm) from inter-male competition for sexual partners. Being more wealthy makes for a more succesful spouse and hence less stress resulting in violence.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Violent [crimes](http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140545/) are associated with high concentration of wealth which suggest that the inter-male competition is strongest.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.1.4. Con: It is [immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_crime) that leads to violence; not white supremacy.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2. Pro: The dominance of white men in world affairs was felt in a high status when encountering other people.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2.1. Con: For European women this reduced feeling of cultural supremacy has created benefits.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Full-time working mothers in 1995 spend as much time with their children as part-time employed mothers in1975. More [equality](http://www.soc.umn.edu/~elkelly/Bianchietal2000HouseworkTrends.pdf) with their husbands has allowed them for this.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Women do less [housework](http://www.soc.umn.edu/~elkelly/Bianchietal2000HouseworkTrends.pdf) while men do more.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Women have [lost](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=JgZ2_QFbEmMC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) equally a status they once enjoyed as role models for women in colonized societies.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2.2. Pro: There is a clear white skin preference in dating today that most likely was present in the 20th century.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: In social dating [apps](http://qz.com/149342/the-uncomfortable-racial-preferences-revealed-by-online-dating/), white \(wo\)men are treated preferentially over other ethnicities.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2.2.2. Con: Among [men](http://qz.com/149342/the-uncomfortable-racial-preferences-revealed-by-online-dating/), all racial groups prefer another race over their own. So this preference could equally be imagined.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: Whites overwhelmingly prefer to date members of their own race, while blacks, especially men, are far more likely to cross the race barrier. This creates a [preference](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110211183853.htm) in dating for white men.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2.2.4. Pro: White men and women have an exclusionary racial dating behaviour [favoring](http://paa2008.princeton.edu/papers/80046) white.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2.2.5. Con: Black men are more [attractive](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886910004617) than white men.
1.8.3.1.7.2.1.2.2.6. Pro: White women are more [attractive](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886910004617) than black women.
1.8.4. Pro: The EU is the [second largest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=46&pr.y=16&sy=2014&ey=2014&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=998&s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP&grp=1&a=1) economy in the world.
1.8.5. Pro: According to the World Bank, 24 out of the 28 EU member states rank under the first 50 of the [wealthiest nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita).
1.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.9.
1.10. Pro: It prevents refugees who can afford to pay their part of the expenditures of the receiving state from enjoying social benefits without contributing.
1.11. Con: It is at least optically concerning that this was never something contemplated in the various times that white European people were a significant proportion of global refugees. The decision to apply this policy now, but not, for example, to refugees fleeing World War II suggests an unwillingness to treat refugees from African, Middle-Eastern and Asian backgrounds fairly.
1.11.1. Con: The refugees coming from Ukraine where white and they were not even allowed into Germany, they were sent back to their war torn [homes](http://newobserveronline.com/white-war-refugees-not-allowed-in-germany/)
1.12. Pro: Wealth comes from the economy of the society in which that wealth is earned. Valuables that refugees bring with them should be repatriated to their country of origin.
1.12.1. Con: Any country has no right to collect property of its citizens.
1.12.2. Con: The property of refugees was already taxed in the country of origin.
1.13. Con: Taking valuables from refugees puts them at a disadvantage. Such valuables can be sold or borrowed in order to become independant.
1.14. Con: To physically search refugees for valuables has negative effects.
1.14.1. Con: When refugees arrived in Munich, they submitted to mandatory health checks. Negative effects of this similar requirement are unproven.
1.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.
1.14.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.14.4. Pro: By being forced to be searched refugees' privacy rights are violated.
1.15. Pro: This strategy would work as deterrence and help keep refugees out.
1.15.1. Con: Economically successful refugees bring with them the skills and spirit to contribute to the economy in the host country and are therefore sought after refugees.
1.15.2. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.15.3. Con: It is not clear that deterring refugees is a good thing in the first place.
1.15.3.1. Pro: Trapping displaced people in conflict zones can exacerbate conflict and overstretch foreign countries when they are drawn in.
1.15.3.2. Pro: Studies in the area suggest substantial [economic benefits](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1602.pdf) that can be drawn from properly handled refugee flows into a country.
1.15.4. Con: Refugees are not in a state of mind where they can decide not to go somewhere, because they know their money would be taken.
1.15.4.1. Con: They all have smartphones, thus they can get information before fleeing their countries and while fleeing, where their valuables will get confiscated and then decide in which direction to go.
1.15.4.2. Con: Refugees are aware of the costs of single steps down to 40 Euros for the trip from Serbia to Hungary. This makes them highly likely to be aware of a maximum level for valuables. \([foreignpolicy.com](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/29/the-road-to-germany-2400-refugee-syria-migrant-germany-nonfiction-comic/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=New%20Campaign&utm_term=*Editors%20Picks)\)
1.16. Pro: This would show that refugees have something to give in return, which would be good for their reputation.
1.16.1. Con: Refugees have labor force to offer. Instead of taking away their valuables, they just should rather be allowed to work and contribute economically.
1.16.1.1. Con: Offering labor force does not create positive reputation.
1.16.1.1.1. Pro: Without additional jobs immigration will reduce wages and therewith enhance the inequalities between rich and poor.
1.16.1.1.1.1. Pro: Reduced wages because of immigration could fuel the resentments on the political right and within parts of the population even more.
1.16.1.1.1.2. Pro: This depends particularly on the extent to which migrants have skills that are substitutes or complements to those of existing workers. If the skills of migrants and existing workers are substitutes, immigration can be expected to increase competition in the labour market and drive down wages in the short run.
1.16.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If, on the other hand, the skills of migrants are complementary to those of existing workers, all workers experience increased productivity which can be expected to lead to a rise in the wages of existing workers.
1.16.1.1.1.3. Con: Reduced wages are good for the competitiveness of companies, which already are experiencing huge pressure with too high wages compared to other countries in Asia for example.
1.16.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Economies gain economic advantage through efficiency gains rather than labor input. Asian countries [cannot compete in the long term](http://econ.sciences-po.fr/sites/default/files/file/myth_of_asias-miracle.pdf) because their economies are based mostly upon the input of production factors.
1.16.1.1.2. Con: This would make Germany more competitive as a production base as it would likely reduce wages.
1.16.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.16.1.1.1.3.
1.16.1.1.3. Pro: Considerable time will be needed until the reputation effects can be seen. Confiscating valuables is faster and directly linked to refugees.
1.16.1.1.3.1. Pro: Benefits refugees contribute to the overall health of the economy are difficult to link to refugees given the complex interdependence of our economy and its development.
1.16.1.1.4. Con: But it shows that refugees actually have something to offer to society.
1.16.1.1.4.1. Pro: The image of a working refugee will destroy the picture of refugees depending on welfare and therewith improve their reputation.
1.16.1.1.5. Con: The reputation ones workforce creates is linked highly to the work they do. Being a legal, tax paying worker always creates positive reputation, because one is a productive part of society.
1.16.1.2. Pro: Especially when taking into consideration that 80% of common refugees in Germany are under the age of 30.
1.16.1.2.1. Pro: This would be a positive effect on the German economy and the age pyramid as well.
1.16.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.16.1.1.3.
1.16.1.3. Pro: Otherwise this is a huge waste of potential talents, skills and manpower which finally results in a deficit for society.
1.16.2. Con: Because it is not given voluntarily it will not be positive for their reputation.
1.16.3. Pro: It makes refugees more accepted among the sceptical public.
1.16.3.1. Pro: Many people are afraid that their country cannot pay for all the incoming refugees and see the refugees as competition regarding social welfare, jobs, etc. This may change if refugees have to contribute to their "new country" financially.
1.16.3.1.1. Con: €1500 will not be enough to balance the costs, the integration of refugees is causing, and thus will not change the mind of people, who fear, refugees would take away their social welfare money.
1.16.3.2. Pro: It is a symbolic gesture that appeases the right wing public.
1.16.3.2.1. Con: Radical right-wing groups can tout the gesture as their success and therewith gain more supporters.
1.16.3.2.1.1. Pro: The Swiss People's Party which supported the Minaret Ban lists it as their success and uses it to advocate their later opinions.
1.16.3.2.1.2. Con: Most people that would vote radical right, would do so, no matter whether these parties have proven that they were effective in bringing legislative change or not.
1.16.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Populism exactly rides on decrying current situations. Populist parties do not need to prove anything.
1.16.3.2.1.2.2. Con: Populist parties can create the image of being successful in delivering their utopian promises.
1.16.3.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Nobody votes for a party that seems incapable of delivering on its promises, in case it got elected.
1.16.3.2.2. Pro: What [influences](http://doc.utwente.nl/61252/1/Lubbers02extreme.pdf) potential right wing voters most is their economic and social status expressed. Confiscating valuables improves refugees' economic and social status and thus will reduce support for right-wing groups.
1.16.3.2.3. Con: The right wing public does not care about money but about the refugees' religion, ethnicity and culture.
1.16.3.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.16.3.2.2.
1.16.3.2.3.2. Pro: Anti-Muslim attitudes are making most refugees not accepted. These do not change with confiscating valuables.
1.16.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: People do believe that Islam and Christian values do not fit together. Islamic refugees are being discriminated against, because of their religion.
1.16.3.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Not all people in Germany are Christians, so even if the two religions would not fit together, this argument would be irrelevant.
1.16.3.2.3.2.1.2. Pro: The name PEGIDA itself shows that clearly. They are not opposed to refugees in general, but to Muslims in specific.
1.16.3.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: [PEGIDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegida) explicitly states that it does not oppose Muslims who have integrated into society.
1.16.3.2.3.2.1.3. Pro: [Felix Baumgartner](http://www.rp-online.de/panorama/leute/felix-baumgartner-hetzt-auf-facebook-gegen-angela-merkel-und-fluechtlinge-aid-1.5720483), extreme athlete, posted a statement on Facebook, where he says he believes that Islam and Christianity do not share the same values, because of the way Islam is treating women.
1.16.3.2.3.2.1.3.1. Con: The value of statements of people who free fall from 40 km out of a balloon for a lemonade producer, in questions of religious/philosophical/political aspects, is questionable at best.
1.16.3.2.3.2.1.3.2. Con: Felix Baumgartner is, due to his [treatment](https://www.facebook.com/FelixBaumgartner/photos/a.438276003803.225765.58427163803/10153622023013804/?type=3) of women, not qualified to speak about ways of how to treat women.
1.16.3.2.3.2.2. Pro: A British organizer of PEGIDA states, that their main motivation for protesting is their fear of Islam. \([theguardian.com](http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/feb/28/newcastle-pegida-organiser-explains-reasons-for-march-video)\)
1.16.3.2.3.2.3. Pro: Refugees with Christian denomination were not a problem for many societies regardless of race.
1.16.3.2.3.2.3.1. Con: [Christian refugees](http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/7284/turkey-christian-refugees) which fled into Turkey \(Anatolia\) have to hide their religious identities because there is potential prosecution and discrimination.
1.16.3.2.3.2.4. Con: Anti-immigration demonstrations do not target all foreigners but only those that are perceived as economic refugees.
1.16.3.2.3.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.16.3.2.3.2.1.2.1.
1.16.3.2.3.2.4.2. Pro: In its manifesto [PEGIDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegida) explicitly approves the acceptance of war refugees and politically persecuted people.
1.16.3.2.3.2.4.2.1. Con: PEGIDA only accepts refugees as long as they fulfill certain qualifications.
1.16.3.2.3.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Accepting to give away all valuables above €1500 would hence make them acceptable.
1.16.3.2.3.2.5. Con: Regardless of being driven by racism or social acceptance, receiving money for something always makes accepting refugees easier.
1.16.3.2.3.2.5.1. Pro: It enhances the chances that no taxpayer money will be used.
1.16.3.3. Con: People who do not accept refugees in general will not start supporting them just because they pay some amount of money when they arrive.
1.16.3.3.1. Pro: PEGIDA opposes refugees because they are afraid of 'all these young male Muslims'. Money will not change this.
1.16.3.3.2. Pro: PEGIDA's theses show that money is not the reason they are opposing refugees.
1.16.3.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.16.3.2.3.2.4.2.
1.16.3.3.3. Pro: [AfD supporters](http://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/afd-supporters-lean-towards-xenophobia-and-fascism-research-says/) lean towards xenophobia and fascism, money cannot change that.
1.16.3.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.16.3.2.3.2.2.
1.16.3.3.5. Con: -> See 1.16.3.2.2.
1.16.3.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.16.3.2.3.
1.16.3.4. Pro: Public dissatisfaction with the political regime significantly facilitates [right-wing extremism](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.203.4186&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Confiscating valuables creates more satisfaction and thus makes refugees more acceptable.
1.16.3.5. Con: -> See 1.16.3.2.3.2.
1.16.3.6. Con: Demonstrations against refugees, especially in Germany, supported by very "sceptical" citizens are ultimately driven out of racism, not due to the lack of social acceptance.
1.16.3.6.1. Con: It is not racism but the intolerance towards Islam that drives the fears in the population.
1.16.3.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.16.3.2.3.2.2.
1.16.3.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.16.3.2.3.2.3.

1.16.3.6.4. Con: -> See 1.16.3.2.3.2.5.
1.16.3.6.5. Con: The new radical right is [primarily supported](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227620490_'Immigration_Sceptics_Xenophobes_or_Racists_Radical_Right-wing_Voting_in_Western_Europe') by voters who are unhappy about the prevailing immigration policy rather than xenophobes or racists.
1.16.3.6.5.1. Pro: Only the appeal on the immigration issue [unites](http://cps.sagepub.com/content/41/1/3.full.pdf) all successful populist right parties while racism performs little in this task.
1.16.3.6.5.2. Con: Ethnonationalist xenophobia served as the [major driver](http://jensrydgren.com/Is%20extreme%20right-wing%20populism.pdf) for right wing political parties since the 1970s.
1.16.4. Con: -> See 1.2.
