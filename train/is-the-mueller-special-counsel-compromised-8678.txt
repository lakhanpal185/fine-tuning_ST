Discussion Title: Is the Mueller special counsel compromised?

1. The Mueller special council is compromised.
1.1. Con: Deputy AG Rob Rosenstein stated that [after looking into the issue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-13/gop-to-grill-rosenstein-on-anti-trump-bias-in-mueller-s-probe), he sees no reason to interfere with the investigation.
1.2. Con: Both Justice Department policy and the Civil Service Reform Act "prohibit using political affiliation and may also prohibit using certain ideological affiliations in hiring and taking other personnel actions with regard to career attorneys", [according](https://oig.justice.gov/special/s0901/final.pdf) to the department's inspector general.
1.2.1. Pro: This means that Robert Muller was prevented from considering political affiliation when choosing his team of investigators.
1.2.2. Pro: Career attorneys are bound my professional codes to rise above partisanship, as they swear an oath to uphold the Constitution, both as lawyers as well as as law enforcement officers.
1.3. Con: To accuse the investigation of being "compromised", the burden of proof of is on the accusers. There is no evidence \(even regarding Strzok and his political anti-Trump bias\) that literally suggests that there is anything inappropriate going on in the prosecution.
1.4. Pro: There is a compromise because any investigator who has different political allegiances from the president is suspicious, and suspicion amounts to guilt.
1.4.1. Pro: Mueller used to be director of the FBI.
1.4.1.1. Con: Being a former director of the FBI does not demonstrate that the special council is compromised.
1.4.1.2. Con: Most law enforcement officials are conservative Democrats or Republicans, as they stand on the side of law and order.
1.4.2. Pro: Mueller is pretty close with Comey
1.4.2.1. Con: Guilt by association will march everyone to prison.  Being "pretty close with Comey" is not an argument or even a given.
1.4.2.2. Con: Association with someone like Comey doesn't make a strong case for bias. Comey himself maintained his objectivity long beyond what most people would be capable of, until he was directly dragged into a necessarily political position by the President himself during the private talk.
1.4.3. Pro: Mueller has stacked his team with Democrats who likely have anti-Trump bias.
1.4.3.1. Con: Trump's statement that Muller's team has "13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans" has been rated only half true by [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/21/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claims-about-Mueller/).
1.4.3.2. Pro: The Strzok text messages are damning.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Strzok was only removed after the AG intervened.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: Strozk was in charge of editing of Comey's description of Hillary's handling of emails.
1.4.3.3. Con: A \(hypothetical\) bias against a suspect is expected from law enforcement, as they are taking a prosecutorial stance against their suspects; It's not a compromise unless there is some violation of rights, forged or hidden evidence, abuse of suspects or witnesses, etc. etc. The bias isn't even beneficial to the prosecution in court, unless they can make a real case.
1.4.3.4. Con: Robert [Mueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mueller) is a Republican.
1.4.3.4.1. Con: 'Establishment' Republicans can have an anti-Trump bias.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Con: "Can" have bias does not equal "do" have bias.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: Mueller was [appointed to offices](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/21/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claims-about-Mueller/) by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as by Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. This shows that both sides have trusted him to do his job in an unbiased way.
1.4.3.5. Pro: Several members on Mueller's team have made large contributions to the DNC
1.4.3.5.1. Con: Donald Trump has also repeatedly made [donations](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-donald-trump-wrote-10-checks-hillary/) to the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaigns.
1.4.3.5.2. Con: The person who made the largest donation to the Democrats in Muller's team has also made donations to [federal Republican](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/21/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claims-about-Mueller/) campaigns.
