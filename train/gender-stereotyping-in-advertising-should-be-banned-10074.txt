Discussion Title: Gender Stereotyping In Advertising Should Be Banned

1. Gender Stereotyping In Advertising Should Be Banned
1.1. Pro: Gender stereotypes cause people, and especially women, to internalise sexist ideas about themselves.
1.1.1. Pro: Gender stereotyping can affect how children feel about themselves and how they relate to others. In a 1975 study, children exposed to TV advertisements depicting reversed gender roles rated male-dominated professions as more appropriate for women than did children exposed to TV advertisements portraying women in the traditional homemaker role. \([pg.2](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.7466&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\)
1.1.1.1. Pro: [Research](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/6/2563) has shown that children younger than 8 years are cognitively and psychologically defenseless against advertising. They do not understand the notion of intent to sell and frequently accept advertising claims at face value.
1.1.2. Con: Gender stereotypes can also help us accept and celebrate our differences. That all genders should be treated equally doesn't necessarily imply that all genders are a homogeneous entity.
1.1.2.1. Con: Stereotypes inherently reduce the multifaceted aspects of people's identities into singular signifiers — nurturing, sexy, strong — in a manner that obscures the many other aspects of people's characteristics that do not conform to those norms.
1.1.2.2. Con: All genders may not be homogenous entities, but the prevalence of some stereotypes \(such as those tied to gender\) over others implies that genders are in fact homogenous because they are portrayed in very similar ways.
1.1.3. Pro: Sexist advertisements increase body dissatisfaction among men and women.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The standard of beauty, propagated by adverts that use gender stereotypes, is unattainable for most women. This negatively affects women's self esteem and mental health.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Women exposed to sexist advertisement exhibit a greater discrepancy between actual and ideal body size than do women exposed to nonsexist advertisements. \([pg.2](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.7466&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\)
1.1.3.2. Pro: Sexist TV advertisements that portray women as sex objects also portray especially attractive, athletic, or muscular men \(at least relative to comparable ads that do not employ the female sex object sub-type\) and thereby cause men to feel insecure about their bodies through social comparison. Such sexist ads therefore have an influence on men’s beliefs and satisfaction with their bodies. \([pg.3](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.7466&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\)
1.1.3.3. Con: While advertisements undoubtably portray ideal bodies that the average person does not compare favourably to, that is likely also true of the people depicted in the media being consumed. At best advertising is a minor instance of this much larger issue.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Advertising is at least upfront that it is portraying an aspiration ideal for people to buy in to. Depictions of perfect bodies in other media, that are nominally telling stories to which normal people can connect to, have a more insidious normative effect.
1.1.4. Con: A ban is not necessarily the best way to counteract this effect.  Offensive speech should usually be countered by opposing speech, rather than by suppressing people's freedom of speech.
1.1.4.1. Con: Only companies with large amounts of money to spend on advertising have the ability to counteract this form of speech in an equally effective manner. Given this unlevel playing field advertising hardly qualifies as an arena for free speech.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Advertising qualifies as an arena for free speech because it is speech.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Companies with large amounts of money create advertisements to appeal to the biggest part of their target audience that they can. If ads that defy stereotypes seem popular, they will be made.
1.1.5. Con: Stereotypes are an architectural method of categorizing things to better understand and communicate. The only reason a stereotype is ever formed in the first place is because there are common characteristics or traits. Not all stereotypes are negative and any offence taken to stereotypes are often subjective.
1.1.6. Pro: Gender stereotyping in advertising often display and propagate oppressive sexual norms.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Axe is known for displaying women as objects who are present to please and satisfy the sexual needs of men using their "Axe Effect" commercials.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: The Axe Effect advertisements also promote the belief that all men are[incapable of controlling themselves](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/axe-commercial-suggests-that-women-ruin-everything_n_3689409.html) when women are nearby, thereby negatively stereotyping male personality traits as well.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Head&Shoulders ran an [ad campaign](https://www.firstpost.com/blogs/head-and-shoulders-new-ad-stands-above-the-rest-in-misogyny-1516733.html) in India encouraging men to quit using their wife's shampoo before they "stop being a man" raising questions about sexual norms that dictate the way in which men ought behave.
1.1.7. Pro: Gender stereotypes within advertising are often internalized by young women. This results in many women not fulfilling their potential and / or not working in occupations that they might otherwise have aspired to.
1.1.7.1. Pro: According to a 1984 study, female graduates who watched traditional advertisements with gender stereotypical roles subsequently placed less emphasis on educational achievement compared to homemaking in essays about their future. \(The Social Science of Cinema, [pg.42](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=0_NMAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.1.7.2. Pro: A 2002 experiment shows that when compared to women viewing nontraditional or neutral advertisements, the women watching stereotypical portrayals scored lower on a math test, answered a smaller number of math problems, and demonstrated less interest in quantitative fields. This shows that with repeated exposure, women may not only underestimate their mathematical aptitude but also narrow their career prospects based on similar misconceptions. \(The Social Science of Cinema, [pg.43](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=0_NMAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA43#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.2. Pro: Gender stereotypes in advertising restricts individual autonomy.
1.2.1. Con: Competition creates the need for companies to differentiate from one another which leads to diversity even within gender stereotypes in advertising. This multiplicity means that people are more likely to question those stereotypes than if they were only exposed to one dominant stereotype transmitted by social norms without advertising.
1.2.1.1. Con: On the contrary, advertising tends to uncritically parrot the most common kinds of stereotype because they are the conceptions of gender that society at large is most familiar with, and as such using them makes it easier to sell products.
1.2.1.2. Con: Gender stereotypes, even if they are 'diverse', are still inherently harmful.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.2.3. Pro: In most developed countries people watch [upwards of three or four hours of television](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276748/average-daily-tv-viewing-time-per-person-in-selected-countries/) each day, meaning that the norms it portrays form a significant portion of their lived experience.
1.2.4. Pro: Gender stereotypes within advertising contributes to the pressure that society places on individuals to conform to gender stereotypes.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Advertising aimed at men often objectifies women, which further puts pressure on women to behave in specific ways.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Given that advertisements exist to sell products, reproducing the male gaze which objectifies women in advertisements aimed at men is a commercially sound strategy.
1.2.4.2. Pro: A [research](https://mediatel.co.uk/newsline/2017/07/28/three-quarters-of-women-feel-stereotyped-in-ads/) by Universal McCann found that 49% of women surveyed “felt pressure from advertisements to be a certain way” and 44% agreed that advertisements had made them feel “not good enough”. Meanwhile, 46% of male respondents said they had felt the need to look or behave in a certain way because of how they are represented in advertising.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Gender stereotypes within advertising place pressure on women to perform the majority of domestic labor, and to aspire to be mothers \([UNESCO, p.8](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000370/037077eo.pdf)\).
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Men feel relieved when their wives do housework and being a mother is a valuable endeavour.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Gender stereotypes within advertising, contributes to society placing pressure on men to not be ' feminine' or 'express their emotions'. This limits the autonomy of men.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Men are particularly prone to [depression](https://www.michigandaily.com/section/news/research-reveals-gender-differences-stress-vulnerability) and [suicide](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/21/suicide-gender-men-women-mental-health-nick-clegg). Gender stereotypes within advertising contribute towards men feeling unable to request help when they experience mental health symptoms.
1.2.4.5. Pro: When people are continuously exposed to gender stereotypes, it changes their perception of who they are and how they should act.
1.2.5. Con: Advertisers seek to link products to gender norms so that men and women feel empowered to use products which are not traditionally associated with their gender.
1.2.5.1. Con: Such advertisements are the exception rather than the rule. The benefits that they offer are thus likely overcome by the harms that traditional stereotyping perpetuate.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Examples of this include, beauty products 'for men', and DIY products 'for women.' The adverts for these products use gender stereotypes to meaningfully increase individuals' autonomy and ability to make choices and experience new things.
1.2.6. Con: People have the right and ability to watch or not to watch advertisements, so their autonomy is not impacted.
1.2.6.1. Con: The restriction of autonomy is not to do with whether or not individuals have the choice to watch this advertising. Rather it is to do with the subconscious effects advertising that appeals to stereotypes has on people.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: [This research](http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2450394&page=1) shows that gender stereotypes can largely contribute to individuals' perception of themselves and become self-fulfilling prophecies.
1.2.6.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.2.
1.2.6.1.2. Pro: It is [reported](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/9191107/Think-Tank-Its-the-subconscious-that-makes-ads-work.html) that the primary driver of the effectiveness of advertisements is consumers' subconscious response to advertising and not conscious consumption of superficial claims.
1.2.6.1.3. Con: Seeing a stereotype does not mean that someone will believe the stereotype, especially if they already expose themselves to more accurate information.
1.2.6.2. Con: It is almost impossible to completely avoid advertisements in today's world where competition between brands is so high.  This means that companies turn to new and innovative ways to advertise their brands. Advertisements are present all around us- in newspapers, magazines, on television, billboards and even online.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: Most Americans are exposed to [around](https://www.redcrowmarketing.com/2015/09/10/many-ads-see-one-day/) 4,000 to 10,000 advertisements each day.
1.2.6.3. Pro: Services such as Netflix, Tivo, or Youtube Red already allow people the ability to opt-out of advertising if they find it troubling or annoying.
1.2.6.3.1. Pro: People hence see, what they want to see, making it a self fulfilling prophecy
1.2.6.4. Pro: Internet browsers now have ad-block plugins that users can deploy to avoid advertisements on websites.
1.2.6.4.1. Con: A lot of websites mandate that users disable their ad-blockers if they wish to view the content on the site.
1.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.
1.3. Pro: Gender stereotyping perpetuates harmful social narratives surrounding women.
1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.3.
1.3.2. Pro: Gender stereotypes often portray young girls doing traditionally "girly" things like gossiping etc.
1.3.3. Pro: Gender stereotypes within advertising reinforces and contributes towards the prejudice against female candidates that many employers have.
1.3.3.1. Pro: The majority of women used in advertising, are attractive, skinny and young. This contributes to a narrative within society that suggests women who do not conform to these traits are not as valuable. This narrative contributes towards workplace discrimination.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Gender stereotypes within advertising perpetuate the notion that women should not aspire to hold 'traditionally male occupations.' These stereotypes, which are [internalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalisation_\(sociology\)) by employers, result in women being unfairly denied opportunities, even when they are just as qualified, or more qualified than successful male applicants.
1.3.4. Con: Gender stereotypes are not harmful because they provide a blueprint for how you are expected to behave, which is good in order to create a society with high levels of harmony, social trust and altruism.
1.3.5. Con: Gender stereotypes do not necessarily perpetuate harmful narratives. For example, portraying women as nurturing is problematic if there are no counter-veiling narratives, but if presented as one valid choice amongst many that portrayal would ring true and encourage the many women who are caregivers.
1.3.6. Con: The forms of stereotyping offered in advertising are those that are socially palatable given they are publicly broadcast and need to ultimately endear people towards a brand or product. They thus present some of the least-harmful stereotypes, whereas those expressed in private likely contribute much more to harmful social narratives.
1.3.7. Con: A ban may not be necessary. As attitudes shift and gender stereotyping becomes less effective, the practice will decrease or stop without needing a ban.
1.3.8. Pro: Stereotypes contribute to and provide strong reinforcement to gender norms and popular conceptions of what somebody of a particular gender can be. They therefore make challenging these norms, which are often the site of many aspects of gender inequality, much harder.
1.3.9. Pro: Stereotypes reinforce women's objectification.
1.3.9.1. Pro: The advertising industry tends to be overwhelmingly [male dominated](https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2016/feb/03/how-advertising-industry-fails-women). This means it is very likely to uncritically reproduce the male gaze, which tends to objectify women, in the advertising it produces.
1.3.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.
1.3.9.3. Pro: Adverts that objectify women, contribute towards [rape culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture).
1.3.9.3.1. Pro: Men exposed to advertisements depicting women as sexual objects are significantly more accepting of rape-supportive attitudes and sex role stereotyping compared to a group viewing advertisements featuring women in progressive roles. \(Social Psychology of Consumer Behavior, [pg.11](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=XPx5AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.3.9.4. Pro: Men exposed to advertisements depicting women as sexual objects are more likely to later indulge in sexist behaviors, such as stereotyped information acquisition and sexualized behavior during a job interview with a female applicant. \([pg.1](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/111/gender%20typed%20advertisements.pdf)\)
1.4. Con: Gender stereotypes reflect reality.
1.4.1. Con: On the contrary, gender is a social construct that gender stereotypes in advertising contribute to.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Gender stereotypes tend to vary widely based on both time and place. For example, ancient Greek men, who tended to wear skirts, often mocked Persian men for wearing trousers because they thought doing so was effeminate.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Gender stereotypes within adverts, overwhelmingly suggest that an individuals' gender is determined by their biology. This repressive representation of gender is particularly harmful for trans people.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: For the overwhelming majority, there is in fact alignment of biology with gender.  [A 2016 NY times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/health/transgender-population.html) estimates 0.6% of the US population is trans, meaning that there would be gender/biology alignment for 99.4% of the population.
1.4.2. Pro: Advertisements mirror the aspirations, ideals, and values of a society, [even if](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=XPx5AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false) the mirror is distorted by reflecting only certain values and lifestyles.
1.4.2.1. Con: Advertising only reflects the part of society that are useful for the advertisers to increase consumption. This leads to certain ideals being more frequently shown, which in turn leads consumers to believe that these ideals are more important than others. When consumers are repeatedly exposed to stereotyped portrayals, these stereotypes take up more room in consumers’ minds, leading them to believe that such over-simplified versions of reality are in fact true. \(Åkestam, [Pg.31](https://www.hhs.se/contentassets/85ded4ca9b574ab6ba846a5f82975067/sse-phd-diss-2017-nina-akestam_final2articles_lowres.pdf)\)
1.4.2.2. Pro: To ask for the ban of of stereotyping in advertising is to ask that advertisers ignore reality when marketing their products. Currently a standard approach of an advertising agency would be : research their target market, figure out who is buying the product they are selling, then market it to those people as best they can. It's just a mirror of reality, if you look in the mirror and see something you want to change you don't reach for the mirror to change it.
1.4.3. Con: Gender stereotypes in advertising could still be harmful even if they reflected reality.
1.4.3.1. Con: Gender stereotypes are not necessarily negative.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Banning gender stereotypes implies that stereotypical behaviors are negative - so negative that they cannot be shown.  e.g. If you cannot show a woman as a nurse or a homemaker the implication will be that women who are nurses or homemakers are doing something wrong.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Gender stereotypes may not be necessarily negative in the abstract, but the issue is that regardless of this they still tend to communicate a single and limiting representation of what someone of a particular gender can be or amount to.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.4.4. Pro: There are ample ads that depict, for example, [dads as loving caregivers](http://fortune.com/2016/06/19/dadvertising-commercials-fathers-day-ads/).
1.4.5. Pro: Individuals of different genders, on balance, do tend to display slightly different patterns of behavior. It would be absurd for advertisers to pretend that this isn't the case.
1.4.6. Pro: Since the gender stereotypes used within advertising reflect reality, and most individuals do not see them as controversial, it is unclear why it is legitimate for the state to ban the use of gender stereotypes within advertising.
1.5. Con: Advertising does not influence people's perception of themselves.
1.5.1. Con: People are exposed to numerous advertisements and commercials in magazines, television, the Internet, and billboards everyday. Advertisements therefore do have an impact on viewers’ beliefs, values, choices, attitudes, and behaviors, whether consciously or unconsciously.
1.5.1.1. Pro: People learn social norms by observing others’ behavior. In a modern society examples of social behavior come, to a considerable extent, from advertising. Advertising particularly shapes norms and standards in those areas in advertising in which recipients lack first-hand knowledge. \(Social Psychology of Consumer Behavior, [pg.10](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=XPx5AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.1.
1.5.2. Con: Gender stereotypic advertisements play a causal role in shaping people’s self-concepts.
1.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.
1.5.2.2. Pro: Women exposed to advertisements featuring domestic portrayals are less likely to hold a positive orientation towards civic engagement and political participation than women who have not yet seen the advertisements. \(The Social Science of Cinema, [pg.42](https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=0_NMAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.
1.5.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.5.2.5. Pro: Women exposed to TV advertisements depicting reversed gender roles \(e.g. husbands serving their wives dinner\) are found to be less conforming and more self-confident than those exposed to traditional gender roles, and their future aspirations contain more achievement/career themes and fewer homemaking themes. \([pg.2](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.7466&rep=rep1&type=pdf)\)
1.5.3. Con: The entire point of advertising is to make people feel incomplete or inadequate if they do not possess the product being advertised to them. It is absurd to suggest that this would not influence people's self perception.
1.5.3.1. Pro: A [2016 study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101018163112.htm) found that advertising of beauty products had a negative effect on the self esteem of women.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Women are told through advertising that they must shave their legs regularly if they want to conform to their gender's stereotypes. This results in women spending money on products they don't need and feeling needlessly ashamed of any body hair they might have.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Con: Advertising is not the original source of cultural physical ideals, and is not the only way that these ideals are communicated.
1.5.4. Pro: Advertising is there to sell products and services and is not aimed at enforcing any specific stereotypes. Banning stereotypes in advertising will create new stereotypes; i.e. a ban on the use of female models to advertise kitchenware will force advertisers to use only male models.
1.5.5. Pro: People who are influenced by advertisement are susceptible to all kinds of influence, so we would need to ban a lot of other things \(films, books, newspapers, TV\)
1.5.5.1. Con: The key difference is that the purpose of advertising is to sell you things. To do so, it has to attempt to make you feel incomplete and hence identify strongly with the stereotype being presented. Though the stereotypes in other media can still be damaging, this identification is not as strong in those forms.
1.5.5.2. Con: Considering that mass media [have an influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_of_mass_media), banning stereotypes could only be positive.
1.5.6. Pro: It is patronizing to suggest that individuals lack agency, and that their perception of themselves is solely defined by the images they see in adverts.
1.5.6.1. Con: Individuals who see advertising of course retain agency, but the horizons of that agency are limited by what that person thinks is possible or what they think they are capable of. Advertising is part of a subconscious stream that influences these perceptions, and agency is narrowed when it adheres to stereotypes rather than challenges them.
1.5.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.2.
1.5.7. Con: It is well known that mass media [have an effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_of_mass_media) on individual or audience thought, attitudes and behavior.
1.5.8. Con: Advertising can be psychologically damaging to viewers.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Advertising conditions consumers to link certain emotions with specific products. The result is a [mentality](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/653947?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that makes users believe that they like and need certain products but do not fully understand why. This leads to purchasing habits while abandoning rational thought.
1.5.8.1.1. Pro: [Research](https://appliedpsychologydegree.usc.edu/resources/infographics/thinking-vs-feeling-the-psychology-of-advertising/) by the University of Southern California \(USC\) shows that 31 percent of successful advertising campaigns appeal to emotions rather than rationality \(16 percent\).
1.5.9. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.
1.6. Pro: Stereotypes in advertising force people to see offensive images, even if they do not want to.
1.6.1. Con: It is a positive good for people to engage with arguments and images which cause them to feel offended. All growth and development comes from facing those things that cause discomfort when faced. Being faced with words and images that offend, allows us to face and wrestle with 'danger' and 'harm' without truly being endangered or harmed, and serves as an innoculation against true harm or control.
1.6.1.1. Con: Repeated exposure to words or images that cause offense could desensitize people to the acts represented by those words and images. And being desensitized, in turn, might make them more prone to do \(or at least tolerate, and thereby make more likely\) more terrible things occuring in the real world.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that being aware of offensive things will make someone do offensive things. Discussing controversial or offensive problems is not a slippery slope that leads to terrible things happening, and ignoring offensive things does not prevent terrible things from happening.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Being exposed to things which offend a person allows them challenge it. This drives forward the discussion and can lead other people who had not initially been offended to see the other side of the coin.
1.6.1.3. Con: Engaging with offensive and confronting is all well and good when people are consciously choosing to engage in debate or learn about different opinions. When people are forced to do so as part of their relaxation time is likely to trigger backlash and annoyance rather than open-minded consideration.
1.6.1.3.1. Con: People should be expected to be able to cope with annoyance. Whether they choose to consider opposing points of view or be triggered is up to them.
1.6.2. Pro: Some people may have made conscious choices to reject aspects of their gender's stereotypes — such as not having children or dressing in the 'wrong' way — despite societal pressures to the contrary. Being constantly shown images that portray the opposite choice as normal undermines the validity of those decisions.
1.6.3. Con: What counts as an 'offensive' representation of gender is subjective. For example, some feminists will argue that images of women wearing high heels and make up are offensive. Other feminists will argue that these images are 'empowering.'
1.6.3.1. Pro: Because anything could be considered offensive the logical conclusion is that eventually everything will be banned.  As increasing numbers of things get banned free expression becomes too restricted.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Groups with the social, legal, or financial capital will be able to ban things that they find offensive while groups or individuals with less power will be unable to ban things that they find offensive.  This will further marginalize already marginalized groups by giving others the power to restrict media while effectively denying them the same ability.
1.6.3.3. Con: Even if groups differ as to whether a particular attribute is positive at an individual level or not they would still agree that the overwhelming prevalence of just a few stereotypes is disempowering to people in general because it limits their options by reducing the scope of what choices are considered 'normal'.
1.6.3.4. Pro: If the state takes a side in subjective debates, it risks alienating and offending large sections of the population. For example, many conservative women would be offended if the state decided that images of women being housewives should be banned from advertising.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.6.5. Pro: The consent of the viewer is not acquired before they are exposed to potentially triggering imagery.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Advertisements infiltrate many areas of the public sphere. Individuals have a right to access public space and the public sphere without being forced to undergo trauma in order to do so.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: It's impractical to prove to any objective standard that someone has experienced trauma as a result of viewing an image.
1.6.5.1.2. Pro: Gender stereotypes that are used within advertising feature images which can be triggering to individuals who suffer from, or who used to suffer from [eating disorders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/27/beach-body-ready-america-weight-loss-ad-instagram).
1.6.5.2. Pro: These kinds of images, especially in the case of advertising that propagates gender stereotypes to do with sex and sexuality, can often be the site of trauma for some people and are potentially triggering.
1.6.5.3. Con: Advertising, like many other fields is evolving. In the non-traditional advertising channels \(digital media\), consent gradually is become a key factor in determining the quality of the ad-experience.[In Mobile Advertising, Consent is the New Transparency](https://medium.com/tapjoy/part-2-of-2-in-mobile-advertising-consent-is-the-new-transparency-3fc1a1130460)
1.6.6. Con: Seeing these kinds of images can be vital in rallying opposition to repressive attitudes, which exist regardless of whether or not the images do.
1.6.6.1. Con: In the same measure, showing stereotypes in advertising can reinforce the notion depicted and reinforce repressive attitudes.
1.6.6.2. Con: There are other methods of rallying opposition to gender norms, which are preferable.
1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.7. Con: Companies should have freedom of expression.
1.7.1. Pro: Although harmful, banning it from advertising is censorship which should be avoided in a free society wherever possible. Instead, we should be devoting effort to subvert the stereotypes with counter advertisements.
1.7.1.1. Con: Advertisements exist to sell stuff, and the problem is that in the status quo using gender stereotypes is a very effective way of selling people things. Given market incentives, it is unclear what mechanisms exist that could create subversive counter-advertisements.
1.7.2. Con: Speech acts can and should be curtailed if it can be clearly demonstrated that they are causing harm.
1.7.2.1. Pro: What is in the best interests of companies, is often not what is in the best interests of society. This is why the state has a right to place restrictions on the adverts and products that companies produce.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Companies do not have an absolute right to 'freedom of expression.' The state frequently bans companies from advertising messages that cause harm to society. For example, in many nations, tabacoo companies are banned from advertising.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: Many advertisements have been banned from TV and other media because they are deemed to have problematic messaging. This clearly indicates that the freedom of expression of companies is not absolute.
1.7.2.2.1.1. Pro: There is a history of Super Bowl Commercials being [banned](http://business.time.com/2014/01/27/the-13-most-controversial-super-bowl-ads/slide/13-peta-gets-sexy-with-vegetables/) for being too sexually explicit.
1.7.2.3. Con: Mere portrayal of gender stereotypes in advertising does not create the kind of harm that would justify curtailing free speech.  According to the US Supreme Court, the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. \([Schenck v. US](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8474153321909160293&q=schenck+v.+united+states&hl=en&as_sdt=4006)\)
1.7.2.3.1. Con: US courts have rules that to the extent advertising counts as speech it can be curtailed to prevent harms much less than 'present danger' [such as through the FTC's regulations](http://adconsul.org/en/articles/6).
1.7.3. Pro: On a principled basis there is little to distinguish speech acts through advertising and other high-publicity speech acts.
1.7.4. Con: It does not logically follow that companies should have the same rights to freedom of expression as individuals.
1.7.5. Pro: The government should not interfere with a free market.
1.7.5.1. Con: The government may intervene when a free market finds itself in a sub-optimal equilibrium \(for instance when externalities are hurting the population or the environment\).
1.7.6. Pro: It should not be government's role to right every wrong. Bans should be a last resort, used only when normal market pressures can't accomplish the same goal. The marketplace is already accomplishing this.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Individuals are responsible for their ability to accept or reject the messages they consume so the decision to consume products that strengthen gender stereotypes is made by consumers with their purchasing power. In the modern world, companies that deliver outdated stereotypes that no longer resonate with people are not accepted by consumers so there is already a [self-correcting mechanism](http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/tech-is-transforming-the-role-of-cmo-here-are-20-execs-driving-the-innovation/) at play.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: Men’s and women’s roles have been becoming increasingly blurred over the past couple of decades. By falling back on gender stereotypes in their advertising, brands are no longer depicting a world that consumers recognize, so they are [less likely](https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/opinion/gender_stereotyping_is_damaging_brands/2495) to resonate or engage.
1.7.6.1.1.1. Pro: An analysis of more than [6 million posts](https://www.ft.com/content/4904bbc4-6e21-11e7-b9c7-15af748b60d0) on Facebook found that “brands that are speaking in the language of gender equality” win ratings that are 8 to 10 per cent higher on its measure of brand appeal than “[brands that don’t](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferrooney/2017/06/26/sheryl-sandberg-on-gender-equalitys-power-in-advertising-and-business/#5fbdb7d84486)”.
1.7.6.1.1.2. Pro: Several sexist advertisements have faced strong backlash in recent times which shows that people are less likely to accept such outdated ideas now.
1.7.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: Audi triggered outrage in China in 2017 with an advertisement that [compared women to used cars](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2017/07/19/audi-sexist-ad-china/491191001/). The brand later apologized for airing the sexist commercial and removed it.
1.7.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: Jewelry brand Pandora removed [an advertisement](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/pandora-slammed-for-sexist-ad-asking-women-to-choose-between-an-apron-or-a-bracelet-for-christmas-a3711341.html) after it was accused of being sexist by asking if women would prefer an apron or a bracelet for Christmas. The advertisement was received with outrage by many for being “sexist and stereotypical”.
1.7.6.1.1.2.3. Pro: In 2016, [Sprite advertisements](http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/08/sprites-brutally-refreshing-ads-are-just-misogynistic.html) that featured sexist phrases such as “She’s Seen More Ceilings....than Michelangelo” were met with a strong consumer backlash and the company was forced to apologize.
1.7.6.1.1.2.4. Pro: A [2012 Reebok advertisement](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/21/reebok-cheat-on-your-girlfriend-ad_n_1369648.html) that encouraged men to “Cheat on Your Girlfriend, Not Your Workout” was removed from circulation after customer complaints.
1.7.6.1.1.3. Pro: [Research](http://www.ana.net/content/show/id/43814) proves that advertisements in which women and girls are accurately portrayed generate significantly more awareness, recall, and purchase intent than advertisements in which they are not. This is significant because women drive [70-80%](https://hbr.org/2009/09/the-female-economy) of all consumer purchasing.
1.7.6.1.1.3.1. Pro: Girls [prefer brands](https://www.marketingweek.com/2015/02/18/why-brands-are-losing-relevance-with-girls/) that empower them and help them to define and discover who they are in ways that don’t necessarily match up to stereotypes that currently exist in marketing. Brands that default to gender stereotypes when creating products and communications aimed at girls therefore miss out on a lucrative market and endanger future brand loyalty from a young age.
1.7.6.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Dove’s “[Real Beauty](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/21/dove-real-beauty-campaign-turns-10_n_4575940.html)” campaign has run for 13 years, putting forth countless advertisements that changed the conversation about what it means to be beautiful. It has inspired a 60 percent increase in sales over a ten-year period.
1.7.6.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Aerie, a lingerie brand that targets high-school and college-aged women, launched its [#AerieREAL](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aerie-photoshop-sales-growth-2016_us_573d35d6e4b0646cbeec260c) campaign in 2015, pledging not to retouch photos of their models and to showcase a variety of body types. After launching #AerieReal, the retailer’s sales grew by 20 percent in the 2015 fiscal year.
1.7.6.1.1.4. Pro: [Research](https://www.badgerandwinters.com/objectification-of-women) by top advertising firm Badger & Winters found that advertisements that objectified women had a significantly negative effect on brand reputation and consumers’ likelihood of making a purchase.
1.7.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.7.6.2. Pro: Many businesses aim to self-regulate and break away from stereotypes. Regulations that ban gender stereotypes ignore these efforts.
1.7.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.1.1.3.1.1.
1.7.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.1.1.3.1.2.
1.8. Con: Ban of stereotyping will not work in practice.
1.8.1. Pro: Banning of gender stereotypical advertisements will result in reversal of stereotypes \(use of only male actors for cooking, house-cleaning and beauty products and female actors for performance cars, guns and DIY products\) and thus just create new stereotypes.
1.8.1.1. Pro: More complex setups \(where you force all advertisers to use proportional split of actors\) will make advertisement more expensive while still utilizing stereotypical roles.
1.8.1.2. Con: In the context of existing gender norms and stereotypes that will still operate outside advertising, these new stereotypes would be if anything subversive and would lack the harm of reinforcing dominant narratives of gender which is typically associated with gender stereotypes in advertising in the status quo.
1.8.2. Pro: The alignment of an ad with its gender stereotype does not necessarily indicate bias.  Even if genders were randomly selected for advertising spots, about half of the commercials would reflect "gender stereotypes" for products that have a gender stereotype.
1.8.3. Pro: A ban would put sanction for the behavior squarely into the unsubtle and blunt hands of government. Government does not have either the light touch needed not the respect demanded to impact people in their social interactions. It is better for individuals and societies \(as opposed to government\) to rely on shame and chastising to curb offensive actions.
1.8.4. Pro: Education is a more powerful tool than prohibition.
1.8.4.1. Con: Prohibition has been successful in reducing social problems, [e.g. the use of alcohol](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/16/opinion/actually-prohibition-was-a-success.html?module=ArrowsNav&contentCollection=Opinion&action=keypress&region=FixedLeft&pgtype=article), so it should be applied to gender stereotyping as well.
1.8.4.2. Pro: Understanding the stereotyping mechanism, and why so many people fall for it, will be more effective then banning it.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.8.4.1.
1.8.6. Pro: There is no suitable cross-cultural definition of gender stereotyping that would permit such strong legal action.
1.8.6.1. Con: Different definitions of gender stereotypes could be applied in different markets, depending on the cultural context.
1.8.6.2. Con: There are some aspects of gender stereotyping which are moreorless universal to all cultures, such as the idea of women being naturally maternal. Advertisements based on the stereotypes could still be banned.
1.8.6.3. Pro: It would be complicated to differentiate between gender stereotypes and cultural cliches and norms.
1.8.6.3.1. Pro: For exampe, would an ad in which women appear wearing makeup and men appear without makeup be reproducing a gender stereotype? There is no objective answer, and the process of deciding would be complex and problematic.
1.8.6.4. Pro: Enforcing all but the most conspicuous violations would prove difficult.
1.8.6.4.1. Pro: Enforcing this could be a drain on many cities already strained legal system, diverting resources from issues of pertinent immediate safety.
1.8.6.4.2. Con: Enforcing this could be an investment that pays dividends in crime reduction.
1.8.7. Con: Regulating the media industry is near-impossible without specific, detailed cases and exceptions. It would be logistically and realistically more sensible to ban specific advertisements instead of instituting a blanket regulation that may hurt non-harmful advertisements.
1.8.8. Pro: Stereotyping is the main purpose of marketing and advertising. Ban stereotyping almost equals to ban ads. Targeted ads are often targeted depending on age, gender or domain of interests.
1.8.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.
1.8.10. Pro: A bigger segment of consumers will not be affected by brands actively breaking gender stereotypes as compared to the audience that will react positively to them. In [a survey](https://choozle.com/gender-stereotyping-in-digital-advertising-survey/) of 500 people \(250 men and 250 women\), 44% of respondents said that when it comes to their feelings about a brand, they are not impacted by advertisements that aim to break stereotypes.
1.8.10.1. Con: Advertisements often effect people in subconscious or subliminal ways, so the fact that people don't think they are affected by these things ultimately means little.
1.8.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.2.
1.8.10.2. Pro: According to [a survey](https://choozle.com/gender-stereotyping-in-digital-advertising-survey/) of 500 people, 50% of males and 38% of women are likely to experience no impact from a brand trying to break a stereotype.
1.9. Con: Gender stereotyping can sometimes create effective advertisements.
1.9.1. Con: In deciding a regulatory regime for advertisements, whether or not something creates effective advertisements should not be of any concern. The duty of a regulator is to the public at large, not the shareholders of the companies in question.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Marketing alcohol and tobacco to children would probably be an extremely effective advertising strategy, but it is also illegal because of the damage it would do the public good.
1.9.2. Con: Gender stereotyping can be [damaging to brands](https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/opinion/gender_stereotyping_is_damaging_brands/2495). Challenging traditional gender boundaries will create more effective advertisements and have benefits for companies.
1.9.2.1. Pro: According to [research](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/consumers-urge-brands-push-boundaries-gender-stereotyping/1440353#BospXY2AhxAFJTOY.99) from Universal McCann, 65% of women and 59% of men like it when brands use traditional media to challenge stereotypes.
1.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.1.1.
1.9.2.3. Con: If gender stereotyping tends to be damaging to brands, then there is little need to ban it in advertisements as market incentives will naturally lead to their use becoming rarer and rarer.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: The backlash against instances of the use of gender stereotypes in advertising is discursively useful in demonstrating that they are no longer acceptable to the pockets of society at large that still believe in them.
1.9.2.3.2. Pro: If anything, an attempt to censor gender stereotypes in this way is likely to halt this trend and instead give them more appeal. The public tend to resent censorship of this nature, and any ban will make them appear dangerous and subversive.
1.9.2.3.3. Pro: Producers \(including advertisers\) in the market offer what the consumers in the market will tolerate - conversely producers \(including advertisers\) in the market withdraw what the consumers will not tolerate. The fluidity of the market, directed by profit/loss cues will sort out the whole mess without armed coercion. A critical mass of consumer distaste with the practice will be sufficient to alleviate the problem.
1.9.3. Con: Gendered products are unnecessary because many people are starting to prefer non-gendered products.
1.9.3.1. Pro: International marketing firm Havas [surveyed](https://www.ama.org/publications/eNewsletters/Marketing-News-Weekly/Pages/do-consumers-want-gendered-products.aspx) 12,000 people across 32 countries and found that 61% of women and 46% of men believe children should be raised in a gender-neutral manner to avoid rigid gender restrictions.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: According to the survey, 39% of women and 54% of men would still prefer to see girls and boys raised with gender-specific toys, clothes and other products.
1.9.3.2. Con: If many people are starting to prefer non-gendered products then there is little need to ban them as market incentives will ensure that firms cater to those tastes.
1.9.4. Pro: Existing gender stereotyping also makes counter-stereotyping advertisements more effective.
1.9.5. Pro: All good stereotyping in marketing is based on research collected, presenting products and services based on 'Avatars'. Avatars are developed personas, to help a marketer communicate effectively to the target. For example, a brand has a product suitable for  teenage girls who listen to Katy Perry, from high-income-households. Or a service geared towards CEOs that like old-school hip hop. The goal is to communicate effectively.
1.9.6. Con: Gender stereotyping ads do create effective advertisements, but at the expense of gender equality.
1.9.7. Pro: Stereotypes are a common tool in society to more effectively vehiculate meaning through communication \(representing a commonly known situation, you do not need to describe it accurately, as most individuals can make it out from a few "hints"\). What should be banned are offensive stereotypes.
1.9.8. Pro: Communication often relies on cultural shortcuts in order to invoke communal ideas and shared understandings in an efficient manner. That advertising often relies on conflicting stereotypes \(the strong male breadwinner vs. the hapless husband\) shows that this method of importing an idea is simply a tool, not a restriction or instruction.
1.9.8.1. Pro: Stereotypes are not necessarily negative judgments and can simplify communications. This is the main reason that they are considered helpful tools for advertisers, as advertising needs to be processed quickly and with minimal effort. \(Åkestam, [pg.34](http://Stereotypes are not necessarily negative judgments and can simplify communications. This is the main reason that they are considered helpful tools for advertisers, as advertising needs to be processed quickly and with minimal effort)\)
1.9.8.2. Pro: Few products can be marketed to an audience with a scope broad enough to avoid demographic niches. The simple act of demarcating a group that falls in a place on several continuums \(Age, Sex, Gender, Wealth, Geography\) creates the necessity to stereotype.
1.9.8.2.1. Con: Stereotyping to some degree is of course necessary in advertising, but the difference between gender and most other categories is that it is the site of massive amounts of historical violence, inequality and power imbalance. We can allow advertisers to stereotype in other ways without contributing to such baggage.
