Discussion Title: Should The Working Week Be Shortened to 15 Hours For The Same Pay?

1. The workweek should be shortened to 15 hours for the same pay
1.1. Pro: It would free people up to spend time doing things they believe are worthwhile.
1.1.1. Pro: A more healthy way of life will be promoted, as people will have time to exercise and enjoy nature or volunteer.
1.2. Con: People choose to work many hours to maintain a high quality of life.
1.2.1. Con: Quality of life may not only be affected by earnings.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Free time is an invaluable good, and we are losing it when choosing to work more hours.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: For many, working is a pleasure and part of their identity.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: People who love work could still work more than that but be paid over twice as much.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: People can currently work part time, and many do. More people [choose to work full time](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2018/06/04/the-ratio-of-part-time-employed-may-2018), with the only exception in the UK being during the 2008 recession.
1.2.1.1.2.2. Con: Allowing people to work longer for more money would simply devalue those who working 15hrs and we would return to a 40hr week.
1.2.1.1.2.2.1. Con: This is ahistorical; when we moved from a 60-80 hour standard workweek to a 40 hour work week standard, it did not revert in this way.
1.2.1.2. Pro: To reduce life to money seems depressing and unrealistic. Life does not revolve around money.
1.2.2. Pro: Earning more money allows us to afford more quality stuff and services in order to support a quality lifestyle.
1.3. Con: A shortening of the working week would result in further shortage of workers in skilled jobs \(eg medics\).
1.4. Con: It would be too costly for companies.
1.4.1. Pro: There would be a dramatic downturn in productivity and organisation.
1.4.2. Con: Unproductive work due to overworking is also costly for companies.
1.4.3. Con: Automatization can replace workers.
1.4.4. Pro: For many jobs, you can not do them in less time \(customer service, construction, driving\). Paying the same money to people for less time would cripple the economy, as services would not be provided.
1.4.4.1. Con: Unemployed people would cover the labour deficit.
1.4.5. Pro: In many cases pay levels are led by market forces and economic realities, making it impossible to guarantee that pay would be maintained under reduced hours. While the relationship may not be linear it is unreasonable to imply that there would be no reduction in the ‘value’ of employees to businesses and therefore a commensurate reduction in pay that would prove unpalatable.
1.4.6. Pro: A 15 hour work week would result in people working multiple "full time jobs" leading to a massive increase in incomes resulting in hyperinflation.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Even though our productivity has increased, the amount of required work per person has increased in order to maintain the higher consumption level of our current lifestyles.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: [37% of British workers think their jobs make no meaningful or productive contribution.](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/08/12/british-jobs-meaningless/)

This doesn't even count all of the people who do real work in support of meaningless jobs. 

Modern society requires less work than ever before to maintain our current lifestyles, but because of irrational attachment to work culture, we make up pointless jobs that accomplish nothing and force people to go to them all day to pay them for nothing.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Con: No company makes up jobs, it costs them money. If a company is profitable, someone somewhere is paying for it's product, therefore it provides value for them, even if the employees don't see it.
1.4.7. Pro: A country that did this would lose its ability to compete in the global marketplace.
1.5. Pro: Will reduce unemployment by creating more positions in places where jobs actually need to be done.
1.5.1. Pro: Will reduce the need for pointless 'make work' positions, described by Anthropologist David Graeber as ['Bullshit Jobs' ​](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books/reviews/article-review-david-graebers-bullshit-jobs-brilliantly-unpacks-the-modern/)
1.5.1.1. Con: David Graeber is an [anarchist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber), which is a currently unpopular viewpoint in the world.  His views are representative of a small minority of people.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: His analysis about jobs does not rely on any anarchist presuppositions, and so his position as and 'Anarchist' is irrelevant to the validity of his work on that issue.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.7. Con: It would encourage laziness.
1.7.1. Con: This need not be the case; people can fill their free hours with other occupations and hobbies.
1.7.2. Con: While at work people would be more productive due to a better psychological state.
1.7.3. Pro: There would be aeons of surplus time filled with, potentially, very little.
1.8. Pro: It would improve quality of life for employees everywhere.
1.9. Con: It would cause an unrealistic amount of disruption to current practices for both employers and employees.
