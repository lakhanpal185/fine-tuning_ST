Discussion Title: Could letting kids fight help reduce bullying?

1. Letting kids fight could help reduce bullying.
1.1. Pro: It allows things to be dealt with more immediately and not build up.
1.1.1. Pro: Anti-bullying [campaigns](https://bigthink.com/ideafeed/bullying-ineffective) and programmes are ineffective at stopping bullying. In light of this, it is better for children to be able to help themselves rather than suffer in silence.
1.1.2. Con: Fighting back gives a the desired response to a bully and creates an incentive for that bully to return and harass the child who gave them that response again. This makes it more likely for bullying to happen again in the future.
1.1.2.1. Pro: [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9089124) found that of children who are bullied, those who hit back are more likely to be bullied six months later than children who donâ€™t retaliate.
1.2. Con: Violence begets more violence.
1.2.1. Pro: Research indicates that children who face corporal [punishment](https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/38/2/133/1651936) from their parents have an increased long term risk of deviancy and violent behaviour. It is likely that violence between peers will have the same long term effect on parents behaviour.
1.2.2. Pro: Children are poor at telling the difference between someone who is intentionally bullying them and playful, but not malicious behaviour. Allowing children to fight whenever they perceive that they are being bullied opens the door to excessive and cyclical violence without justification.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Research shows that [aggressive children](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1129603?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) are more likely to perceive the behaviour of others as aggressive -even when it is not. This means that they are likely to react in an unnecessarily violent way if they are told it is acceptable for them to do so.
1.3. Con: Bullies would ultimately abuse this and justify themselves by admitting it was an act of bullying.
1.4. Con: There is a potentially higher likelihood for serious injury.
1.4.1. Con: The potential for serious injury \(i.e. broken bones\) is probably much more likely from kids playing \(climbing trees, skateboard tricks\) than from a fistfight and/or wrestling match.
1.4.2. Pro: Even a single punch can kill someone in a fight. In Australia [90 people](https://www.smh.com.au/national/90-killed-in-single-punch-assaults-since-2000-20131201-2yjtr.html) were killed by a single punch between the years 2000-2013.
1.5. Con: It may reduce physical bullying but doesn't address things like cyber bullying.
1.5.1. Pro: Social networking is a relatively new phenomenon. Problems and solutions on these platforms should be openly discussed to optimize people's ability to intelligently manage their children's use of such platforms.
1.6. Pro: Getting a "taste of their own medicine" will prevent more bullying in the future.
1.6.1. Con: This assumes that fights will take place on an even plane, whereby the bully will also feel the effects of being victimized. This won't necessarily be the case.
1.6.1.1. Con: The bully doesn't need to feel victimized in order for the physical conflict to be a success for the challenger. Bullies pick on easy targets and are more likely to respect someone who stands up to them and fights them.
1.6.2. Pro: Standing up to bullies at an early age helps correct their behaviour; whether this requires physical or nonphysical correction depends on the situation.
1.6.3. Con: It would reinforce the ability for strong people to bully the weak.
1.6.3.1. Con: Bullying is the problem. The only adults who are pro bullying are parents of a bully. Letting kids fight stops bullys from having a monopoly on the use of force.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Those who feel confident to engage in bullying would be more likely to be able to fight than their victims.
1.6.4. Pro: [Research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1130744?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) shows that more submissive and non-violent children are more likely to be the victims of schoolyard violence because of their peers. If these children stand up for themselves, they will not be unduly victimised.
1.7. Pro: Teaching kids to stand their ground increases their resilience and ability to handle adversity in the future.
1.7.1. Con: Violent reactions to adversity are unlikely to be beneficial in the future lives of children. Children who learn that violence is an appropriate dispute resolution mechanism are unlikely to succeed in life, even if they are better at standing their ground.
1.8. Con: We have no right to inflict harm on another regardless of circumstances.
1.8.1. Con: Under a utilitarian understanding, allowing for harm to be inflicted for the purpose of reducing greater harm in the future is justified.
1.9. Pro: Fighting back [improves](https://www.today.com/parents/poke-back-why-one-psychologist-says-parents-should-tell-kids-t100941) the self-esteem of the child being bullied.
1.9.1. Con: Children told to fight back by their parents may suffer from worse self-esteem as they feel abandoned by their parents and teachers. This is especially true if they are unable to effectively fight off their bully.
1.9.2. Con: Child psychologists distinguish between [effectual and ineffectual](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1993-97065-011) violent responses to bullying. Children who are predisposed to ineffectual responses are those who already have low self-esteem and emotional competence. For these children, ineffectual fighting responses only make their circumstances worse.
1.9.3. Pro: Children who discover that they are able to physically defeat a person who has undermined their self worth, may find it easier to move on and recover from bullying experiences.
