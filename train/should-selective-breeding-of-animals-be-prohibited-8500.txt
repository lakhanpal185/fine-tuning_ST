Discussion Title: Should selective breeding of animals be prohibited?

1. Selective breeding of animals for pets \(e.g. Siamese cats, pugs, etc.\) should be prohibited.
1.1. Con: Humans enjoy competitions and shows that are based on purebred animals.
1.1.1. Pro: Humans use animals for their own ends in a huge variety of ways. There's nothing distinct about selective breeding of pets that means we should ban it.
1.1.1.1. Pro: It is morally permissible to use animals for human benefit as long as their welfare is taken into consideration.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Aristotle [argued](http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/) that there is a natural hierarchy of living beings with plants serving humans and animals, and animals in turn serving the needs of humans.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Knowingly breeding animals in a way that increases their risk of causing medical problems is not adhering to the animals' welfare.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: [Bentham](https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1979----.htm) points to the capacity for suffering as the vital characteristic that entitles a being to equal consideration.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Pet ownership, especially of dogs and cats, has medical and emotional benefits for humans, for example it helps manage levels of [anxiety and stress](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-health-benefits-and-risks-of-pet-ownership). It is important for this to be accessible for everyone.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Approximately [6.5 million](https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics) companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters, but only 3.2 million are adopted each year. There are enough animals in shelters that prohibiting selective breeding of dogs and cats would not cause access problems for humans seeking animal companions in the US.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Humans are every bit as natural as anything else, we are part of the environment these animals live in. Our artificial selection is simply another way these species adapt and they thrive because of it.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Humans have been [selectively breeding](http://www.encyclopedia.com/plants-and-animals/agriculture-and-horticulture/agriculture-animals/selective-breeding) all sorts of animals and plants for 10,000 years.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Selective breeding occurs naturally to some extent: Early humans decided to cooperate \(symbiotically\) to a larger extent with wolves that had traits that we associate with dogs than those who did not, hence selecting for those traits.
1.1.1.5. Pro: Humans cause far more animal suffering [through farming](http://www.animalequality.net/node/844) than they do through purebred pets.
1.1.1.5.1. Con: This is true, but not relevant. If two things cause suffering, one does not have to stop the larger problem before stopping the smaller one.
1.1.2. Pro: Dog shows have a proud history stretching back over [one hundred](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/about-the-kennel-club/history-of-the-kennel-club/) years. In the present day the most popular show, [Crufts](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-crufts/), has an attendance of 160,000 people and 27,000 dogs. It is broadcast on national TV.
1.1.3. Con: It is immoral to select and encourage animal traits \(and genetic mutations\) based on what humans find pleasant or desirable.
1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.3.2. Con: Purebreed cats constitute less than 15% of pet cats, and are subject to intense scrutiny from geneticists; it simply isn't a large enough issue to warrant banning. \([Ch. 10](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cat-Sense-Feline-Enigma-Revealed/dp/0241960452)\)
1.1.3.2.1. Con: There are over [74 milllion pet cats in the US](https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Statistics/Pages/Market-research-statistics-US-pet-ownership.aspx). That means 11 million purebred cats. This is more than the [number of humans living with bipolar disorder in the US](https://www.bipolar-lives.com/bipolar-disorder-statistics.html), which we devote significant medical resources and mental health attention to.
1.1.3.3. Pro: All domestic animals, particularly those we have selectively bred, are orchestrated to be totally dependent upon us \(e.g. because of their medical requirements\). It is wrong to keep an autonomous being in this state of servitude \(as argued by [Francione G. L. 2012](http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/pets-the-inherent-problems-of-domestication/)\).
1.1.3.3.1. Con: Some domestic animals formed symbiotic relationships on their own with humans. For example, the cat became domesticated when humans started storing grain. ["The cats were delighted by the abundance of prey in the storehouses; people were delighted by the pest control."](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-house-cats-158390681/)
1.1.3.3.2. Con: Whether or not it was wrong to breed animals to depend upon us, we have already done so. There is no clear ethical path we could take to reverse this.
1.1.3.4. Pro: It is an affront to an animal's dignity to disrupt its integrity by selecting traits for human pleasure that go against its natural state \(e.g. breeding a dog that [can't bark](https://iheartdogs.com/meet-the-dog-breed-that-cant-bark/)\). \(Discussed in [Bovenkerk and Nijland 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10806-017-9673-8)\)
1.1.3.4.1. Con: This depends on what one construes as an animal's 'natural state'. All domestic animals are descended from past wild incarnations, with both natural and selective breeding having determined a great many aspects that are now dubiously deemed 'natural'.
1.1.3.5. Pro: Selective breeding objectifies animals turning them into means for our end, for example using a Chihuahua as a fashion accessory \(discussed in [Bovenkerk and Nijland 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10806-017-9673-8)\).
1.1.3.5.1. Con: The article also argues that selective breeding does not objectify the animals: a new animal is born as the result of selective breeding that can be treated with dignity.
1.1.3.6. Pro: This is turning animals into "living parts of our machinery." Transforming them into "production units" robs them of their "animal-ness" and is thus unethical [\(Harfield in Bovenkerk and Nijland, p. 397\)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10806-017-9673-8).
1.1.3.6.1. Con: 'Animal-ness' is a nebulous term, and not helpful; as different breeds adapt to their surroundings, their features and traits will evolve. Cats and dogs alike serve utterly different purposes and display adaptive behaviours to their ancestors, but this does not remove their 'animal-ness'.
1.1.3.6.1.1. Con: Animals used in selective breeding are usually no longer permitted to adapt to their surroundings -- they are placed in unnatural surroundings and given veterinary care that prevents the normal evolutionary adaptation processes.
1.1.3.7. Con: The 'ecomodernist' argument suggests that we humans are the 'God' species and should take control over natural processes in order to achieve human flourishing on this planet [\(Bovenkerk and Nijland, p. 399\)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10806-017-9673-8.pdf).
1.1.3.8. Con: Animals do not have rights, so to say that certain treatment of animals should be prohibited would restrict human freedom without inhering or defending any other entity's rights.  Therefore, selective breeding of animals should not be prohibited.
1.1.3.8.1. Con: Animals have limited rights as owned but sentient beings, much like children.
1.1.3.8.1.1. Pro: There are laws against abusing animals.
1.1.3.8.1.2. Con: While Children have Legal Rights, children insofar as they are ethical agents are fully righted by several rights based ethical theories including versions of Kantian Ethics and Natural law. Therefore it makes sense that children are afforded certain legal rights, but it does not make sense to give animals legal rights because they are not ethical agents.
1.1.3.8.1.2.1. Pro: 1. If something is a righted agent, then they posses the necessary and sufficient cause for all rights which is Reason. 2. Animals do not possess reason 3. Conclusion therefore they are not righted. 4. Human beings do possess reason. 5. Therefore, they are righted.
1.1.3.9. Pro: Techniques for breeding pure bred animals often involve artificial insemination, which can be seen as immoral as it would be classed as bestiality if it was not done for the purpose of producing offspring.
1.1.3.10. Pro: Selective breeding prevents animals from having self-determination regarding their relationships and their offspring's parentage.
1.1.3.10.1. Con: That's an integral part of the concept of having pets. If that is not allowed, having pets should not be an option at all.
1.1.3.11. Con: We are part of the environment of animals and if it is more useful for animals to have specific traits then just like in nature these will propagate.
1.1.3.11.1. Pro: Conciously prefering traits in other animals as their environment is not immoral.
1.1.3.12. Pro: Many dogs, after 100 years of selective breeding, present unnecessary physical detriments to their health [dogbehaviorscience.wordpress.com](https://dogbehaviorscience.wordpress.com/2012/09/29/100-years-of-breed-improvement/).
1.1.3.13. Pro: Attempts to [genetically modify](https://io9.gizmodo.com/6-animals-shaped-by-artificial-selection-into-beautiful-1603184303) animals has led to many monstrous-looking and extremely physically vulnerable animals.
1.1.3.13.1. Con: If breeding business are regulated, these problems can be avoided.
1.1.4. Pro: [Cat shows](http://cat-chitchat.pictures-of-cats.org/2008/05/uk-cat-shows.html) date back to the late 19th Century, and were widely attended, with a large variety of cat breeds. 'Show cats' exist now, usually with a competitive element that rewards purity of breed and behaviour.
1.1.5. Con: In most cat shows, the cats are kept in cages and surrounded by a vast number of spectators; this is potentially very stressful for cats, especially if they are accustomed to roaming more freely.
1.1.6. Pro: [Arguably](http://www.skepticcanary.com/2011/07/28/why-humans-are-more-important-than-other-animals/), humans are more important than animals; we have imagination, self-awareness and potential in a manner not found in animals. As such, we have a right to treat animals as we deem right or necessary.
1.1.6.1. Con: Peter Singer and other philosophers have argued that the basic tenet of justice is that equal interests should be treated equally and unequal interests unequally. If we attach more importance by definition to human interests than to the interests of other animals we are committing speciesism: discrimination on the basis of an irrelevant characteristic, namely species membership \(discussed in [Bovenkerk and Nijland, p. 393](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10806-017-9673-8.pdf)\).
1.1.7. Pro: [The Kennel Club](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/media/1135646/the_kennel_club_annual_report_2017.pdf) made £4.2m from dog shows in 2017. This income helps support the organisation's countless functions which are all ultimately aimed at improving the wellbeing of dogs.
1.1.8. Con: Human enjoyment of competitions and shows is not a sufficient reason to justify the treatment/living-conditions of animals. If it were, we would not have outlawed dog fighting.
1.2. Con: If humans stopped breeding some particular breeds, they could become extinct.
1.2.1. Con: Cloning could pose a viable alternative to selective breeding in cases of potential extinction.
1.2.1.1. Pro: A cat was first successfully cloned [in 2002](http://messybeast.com/clonecat.htm), and tests have continued since.
1.2.1.2. Con: It is almost impossible to [perfectly clone](http://messybeast.com/clonecat.htm) calico or tortoiseshell cats, as their coat colours are determined not only by genes, but by environmental and in utero factors.
1.2.1.3. Con: Cloning has [very low](http://messybeast.com/clonecat.htm) success rates at present.
1.2.1.4. Pro: The [techniques](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078015/) used in selective breeding are essentially the same as cloning.
1.2.1.5. Con: Cloning results in an even higher, or worse, degree of genetical homogenity
1.2.1.6. Con: There is no moral reason as to why cloning, even were it possible, would be preferable to selective breeding.
1.2.2. Con: Extinction might be preferable, given that selective breeding of animals often results in animals that suffer a great deal of pain when they are alive.
1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.3.2.
1.2.4. Con: If pugs or other types of dogs stopped existing it would not be a bad thing. It would be in the same category as we see today when less people getting red hair.
1.2.5. Pro: Well-known and historically important dog breeds, for example the corgi, bloodhound, Scottish deerhound, gordon setter, Norwich terrier, Skye terrier, and many others, are now incredibly [rare](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/meet-22-dwindling-dog-breeds/). The disappearance of these special breeds would be a great loss.
1.2.5.1. Pro: [Bloodhounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodhound#History) and the [Corgi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_Welsh_Corgi#History) have been with humans for around 1000 years.
1.2.6. Pro: Selective breeding can be used in resurrection biology, or '[de-extinction](http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct-archive/articles/selectivebreeding.htm)', to bring extinct species back to life.
1.2.6.1. Pro: There are a number of [extinct dog breeds](https://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2016/02/17/10-extinct-dog-breeds.aspx) - Alpine Mastiffs and Southern Hound included - that are predecessors to modern dogs, and could theoretically be restored through resurrection biology.
1.2.6.2. Pro: There are many [extinct cat breeds](https://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds/viewtopic.php?t=22302207), which could theoretically be restored through resurrection biology.
1.2.6.3. Con: Many animals, regardless of their breeding, are abandoned and have to live in shelters or be euthanised. It is therefore immoral to keep breeding more animals while many are left to die.
1.2.6.3.1. Con: The necessary response to such high birthrate is to responsible [spay and neuter](http://www.animals-abused.org/spay-neuter.htm) pets and abandoned animals. Crucially, animals that are bred can be monitored and their birth rate controlled. Breeding is not the problem.
1.2.6.3.2. Pro: [On the same day](http://messybeast.com/clonecat.htm) as a successful cat cloning, 6000 unwanted cats and kittens were destroyed in the USA. This is a key example of unacceptable situation that has only increased with time, as 'purity' is heralded as the ideal.
1.2.6.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.2.6.3.4. Con: It is [possible](https://familypet.com/yes-you-can-find-purebred-dogs-at-shelters-and-rescues/) to adopt purebred pets.
1.2.6.3.4.1. Pro: Indeed, purebred or pedigree dogs are generally [easier to rehome](https://www.pets4homes.co.uk/pet-advice/could-you-offer-a-new-home-to-a-pedigree-dog.html) once abandoned.
1.2.6.3.5. Pro: In the US, while every year puppy mills breed over 2 million puppies, 1.2 million dogs are [euthanized](http://www.thepuppymillproject.org/about-puppy-mills/) in shelters.
1.2.6.3.5.1. Con: Prohibiting selective breeding does not solve the problem of animal overpopulation, as selectively bred pets are small minority of animals born each year.
1.2.6.3.5.1.1. Pro: [70.000](http://catingtonpost.com/animal-overpopulation-shocking-facts-and-figures/) cats are born every day in the US alone. That's over 25.5 million a year. This dwarfs the number of animals being bred.
1.2.6.3.5.1.2. Pro: There are currently between [70 and 78](http://www.bradfordlicensing.com/documents/pets-fact-sheet.pdf) million dogs in the US. Over half of these are mixed breed.
1.2.6.3.6. Pro: In the UK, with a [9 million](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/kennel-club-campaigns/puppy-farming/) dog population, more than [80,000](https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/news-events/news/stray%20dogs%202016%20summary%20report%20-%20gfk%20social%20research.pdf) dogs were handled by authorities between 2015-2016. From them, 37,000 lost and abandoned dogs remained [unclaimed](https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/news-events/news/the-nations-stray-dog-numbers-fall-by-21-but-twelve-dogs-a-day-face-destruction-because-forgetful-owners-havent-updated-their-dogs-microchip-details) \(and 4% were euthanized\) while every year, pet shops sell around [1.5 million](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/kennel-club-campaigns/puppy-farming/) new dogs.
1.2.6.3.6.1. Con: Lost or abandoned dogs \([37,000](https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/news-events/news/the-nations-stray-dog-numbers-fall-by-21-but-twelve-dogs-a-day-face-destruction-because-forgetful-owners-havent-updated-their-dogs-microchip-details)\) represent just 2.5% of the number of new dogs sold \([1,5 million](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/kennel-club-campaigns/puppy-farming/)\), therefore it does not justify stopping 100% of dog breeding.
1.2.6.4. Pro: Selective breeding programs already exist for the extinct [aurochs](http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct-archive/articles/selectivebreeding.htm#aurochs), [tarpan](http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct-archive/articles/selectivebreeding.htm#tarpan), [quagga](http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct-archive/articles/selectivebreeding.htm#quagga) and the [Barbary lion](http://www.petermaas.nl/extinct-archive/articles/selectivebreeding.htm#barbarylion).
1.2.6.5. Pro: This can be vitally important in helping animals that have, through extensive domestic breeding, lost their original adaptive traits.
1.2.6.6. Con: Focusing undue attention on resurrection biology draws attention away from the [extinction crises](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-efforts-bring-extinct-species-back-from-dead-miss-point/) of over 20 000 animal species.
1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.
1.5. Con: Selective breeding can be beneficial for the animals themselves, not merely their human counterparts.
1.5.1. Pro: Pure breeding can mitigate the harm done by humans. The [featherless chicken](http://www.poultryworld.net/Breeders/General/2007/4/Featherless-the-future-or-an-unsaleable-concept-WP002971W/) is a good example of an animal, which is likely healthier in the conditions we keep chickens in than its feathered peers. It is also more environmentally friendly, and efficient, to farm.
1.5.1.1. Con: We should not be adapting animals to fit our agricultural practices, but rather adapt our agricultural practices to better fit animals.
1.5.2. Con: This is not entirely true of cats; cats have a 'large range of variation in the genes that underpin temperament, learning and behaviour', which makes it challenging to breed cats for specific personality traits. \([Bradshaw, Ch.10](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r8s3_xAj3V8C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q&f=false)\)
1.5.3. Pro: In the case of rats, inbreeding is used to identify problematic genes and features, to avoid problems later down the line. As a result of this experimentation, bad genes can be [all but eliminated](http://www.afrma.org/breeding-inoutline.htm) from the line.
1.5.3.1. Con: This does not consider the problems facing those rats which are born defective in some way, and are subsequently culled.
1.5.3.2. Con: This approach is fundamentally anthropocentric and still places the interests of the animal last. "[Bad genes](http://www.afrma.org/breeding-inoutline.htm)" include behaviour traits such as aggression, which, while troublesome for a human, may be a feature of what makes a rat a rat. The examples of lines with health conditions that you should not breed form likely arose from previous anthropogenic inbreeding, thus are at best a mitigation of a problem selective breeding has caused these animals.
1.5.3.3. Con: Rats breed much faster than most domestic animals. We would have difficulty applying this practice to dogs, for example.
1.5.4. Pro: Selective breeding can also be used to breed out negative characteristics, be they superficial or more serious.
1.5.4.1. Pro: There are [suggestions](http://www.instituteofcaninebiology.org/blog/genetics-behavior-and-puppy-temperament-testing) that selective breeding can help breed out aggression or fearfulness in dogs.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Aggression in dogs is often caused by training. A [study](https://positively.com/articles/aggressive-training-breeds-aggressive-dogs/) has shown that aggressive or aversion-based training creates dogs that are aggressive towards humans.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Selective breeding is necessary for pet's mental health and for our safety. Breeding is what ensures the dogs' mental health with traits like friendliness towards humans and other dogs, calmness, non-aggressive/dangerous play. If mentally healthy dogs are not bred, we will have a lot more [problems](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201703/do-purebred-and-mixed-breed-dogs-show-behavior-differences) with biting, stressful dogs and more.
1.5.4.1.2.1. Con: [Research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201703/do-purebred-and-mixed-breed-dogs-show-behavior-differences) also points out that behavioral differences between purebred and mixed-bred dogs, although partially attributed possibly to genetics, are also highly dependent on environmental factors.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Kennel clubs are taking a number of steps to reduce health complications in purebred dogs.
1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Techniques like "estimated breeding values" are [being used](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/mateselect/ebv/Default.aspx) by the UK Kennel Club. These allow selection against negative traits even with complex inheritance. They have been [successfully deployed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579364/) elsewhere in animal husbandry.
1.5.4.2.1.1. Con: The fundamental problem is the small size of purebred populations. Selecting against certain defects can have unforeseen [negative consequences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579364/) - as individuals are removed from the breeding pool, the genetic diversity further shrinks, potentially exposing other genetic conditions.
1.5.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: In the1970s attempts were made to correct haemolytic anaemia amongst Basenjis \(a bark-less dog\). These attempts resulted in [unintentionally spreading](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/magazines/2010/05-06/the_purebred_paradox_p2.html?credit=web_id145418212) an inherited kidney disease throughout the population.
1.5.4.2.2. Pro: Kennel clubs are actively combating this, for example the UK Kennel Club has a scheme which registers [assured breeders](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/breeding/assured-breeder-scheme/scheme-requirements-and-recommendations/). These assured breeders are required to screen out genetic defects.
1.5.4.2.2.1. Pro: Strategies like this have proved successful, for example reducing the rate of [patella luxation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579364/) in Kooiker dogs.
1.5.4.2.3. Pro: Kennel clubs can orchestrate controlled outbreeding to expunge the genes causing these negative traits.
1.5.4.2.3.1. Pro: A gene that caused kidney problems in Dalmatians [was removed](http://www.fundacion-affinity.org/sites/default/files/whitepaper-estudio-abandono-adopcion-2015-en.pdf) by crossing a Dalmatian with a Pointer, and then back crossing the offspring with Dalmatians for several generations. The result was an essentially purebred dog \(genetically indistinct from other Dalmatians\) without the deleterious mutation.
1.6. Con: Selective breading has allowed pet ownership to be more accessible.
1.6.1. Pro: Genetic engineering has [resulted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078015/) in hypoallergenic pets, including cats and dogs allowing those allergic to pets to still be able to own them and enjoy their company.
1.6.2. Pro: People living in apartments or with small living spaces may only be able to handle a small dog rather than a large one.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.7. Con: Selective breeding can be beneficial for the economy.
1.7.1. Pro: The existence of selective breeding provides a career and an income to numerous people in different professions - breeders, groomers, handlers, veterinarians, show judges etc.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Veterinarians virtually depend on unhealthy dog breeds. \([Bovenkerk and Nijland, p. 401](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10806-017-9673-8.pdf)\)
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Employing doctors is not sufficient reason to promote suffering. It goes against ["the prevention and relief of animal suffering"](https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/veterinarians-oath.aspx) that is the duty of veterinarians.
1.7.2. Pro: Selective breeding allows fashion to permeate the world of animals, which can be seen as beneficial from an economic perspective.
1.7.3. Pro: Selective breeding creates an opportunity for breed-specific products and events.
1.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Many manufacturers produce breed-specific [dog food](https://www.petmd.com/dog/centers/nutrition/evr_dg_do_I_need_breed_specific_dog_food).
1.7.3.3. Pro: [Dog shows](https://www.salon.com/2016/02/15/the_big_money_behind_best_in_show_how_the_westminster_dog_shows_four_legged_tv_celebrities_fuel_the_high_dollar_puppy_business/), in turn, create a preference and demand for purebreds among spectators and the general public, which helps drive the business, regardless of where the person ultimately decides to buy a dog from.
1.7.4. Pro: The sale of purebred dogs worldwide is a multibillion dollar [industry](https://www.salon.com/2016/02/15/the_big_money_behind_best_in_show_how_the_westminster_dog_shows_four_legged_tv_celebrities_fuel_the_high_dollar_puppy_business/).
1.7.5. Con: The surplus of animals bred but potentially not adopted \(and consequently abandoned\) means the community has to house them in shelters. This would be bad for the economy.
1.7.6. Con: Monetary concerns should not outrank ethical concerns.
1.8. Con: It is more often than not that unintended breeding of mixed breeds result in strays and poorly kept animals. Those who spend good money on a pet usually cherish and keep them
1.9. Con: Selective breeding is comparable to natural selection in nature.
1.10. Con: Animals have a wide variety of characteristics \(aesthetic, personality, etc.\) that potential owners will find important. Selective breeding ensures that desirable traits are maintained.
1.10.1. Pro: The very existence of most domestic animals is [predicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_animals) on selective breeding \(at varying stages in their domestication\).
1.10.2. Con: Pet breeders prioritize what the pets' human owners might want, and not the animals welfare, when deciding what the 'best characteristics' are during selective breeding.
1.10.3. Pro: Purebred animals are more predictable in terms of size and behavior, which make it easier for owners to decide what type of pet do they want.
1.10.3.1. Pro: [Different cat breeds](https://www.thespruce.com/personalities-of-popular-cat-breeds-554219) are known for different temperaments and sociability; while this is not an exact science, particularly with cats, it is still a good guide for potential owners and breeders.
1.10.3.1.1. Pro: Certain breeds of cats - including Persians and Ragdolls - are purebred for their [personalities](https://www.thespruce.com/personalities-of-popular-cat-breeds-554219).
1.10.3.2. Con: Breeding animals [for temperament](http://www.instituteofcaninebiology.org/blog/genetics-behavior-and-puppy-temperament-testing) is an inexact science due to environment implications; while some animals may be more predisposed to positive temperaments, their upbringing and training are the more vital factors.
1.10.3.3. Pro: Many people do not want to buy mutts/moggies from shelters as they cannot be sure of the future size, energy levels and temperament of the animal. These are essential factors, and buying or adopting a pet without having regard to these would be irresponsible.
1.10.3.4. Pro: A large study found that there were significantly [fewer problematic behaviours](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172720) amongst purebred dogs than mixed-breed dogs. This is a legitimate reason to choose a pet.
1.10.4. Con: -> See 1.10.3.2.
1.10.5. Pro: In the case of rabbits, selective breeding - far from being abhorred as potentially damaging - is [broadly encouraged](https://www.raising-rabbits.com/selective-breeding.html) \(albeit with occasional caveats\) as a safe way of ensuring the continuation of positive genetics.
1.10.5.1. Pro: The positive genetics described in this article are for: better bone structure, small or large size, or the ability to be better breeders. These all benefit humans rather than the rabbits themselves.
1.10.6. Pro: This does not automatically imply that characteristics will be to the detriment of the animal; selective breeding can be conducted responsibly.
1.10.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.5.
1.10.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.
1.11. Pro: Purebred animals considered 'defective' or that do not develop the preferred characteristics of their breed are more likely to be abandoned.
1.11.1. Pro: If a trait of overbreeding causes major health issues, this [may contribute](http://pictures-of-cats.org/the-reason-why-people-abandon-purebred-cats.html) to owners abandoning their cats; for example, Persian cats need a great deal of care, attention, grooming, and are very prone to a great number of ailments that can put off owners who underestimated the responsibility.
1.11.2. Pro: Further to this, in the case of rabbits, those with [perceived defects](http://www.rabbitadvocacynetwork.org/rabbit-breeding/) may be sold to meat processors, killed for home consumption or sold as snake food; what constitutes a 'defect' is highly questionable, as mild defects do not necessarily preclude a happy life.
1.11.3. Con: Conscientious breeders will not let dogs bred by them to be abandoned. Those puppies that are not able to perform special functions \(e.g. police dog, show-dog\) will be sold to families that are looking for a pet.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Kennel clubs are actively trying to tackle this problem, for example the [assured breeders](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/breeding/assured-breeder-scheme/scheme-requirements-and-recommendations/) scheme in the UK requires that breeders prioritise welfare, help re-home pets they have previously sold, and are open for inspections.
1.11.4. Con: Unfortunately pets get abandoned all the time. Purebreds and mutts have the same likelihood of abandonment if the only reason they were acquired was to perform a certain function or because it was assumed they would look a certain way.
1.11.4.1. Pro: [A study](http://www.fundacion-affinity.org/sites/default/files/whitepaper-estudio-abandono-adopcion-2015-en.pdf) in Spain found that 10% of cats and 21.9% of dogs abandoned were purebred. [Statistics](http://btoellner.typepad.com/kcdogblog/2010/06/why-people-adopt-pets-vs-buy-vice-versa-research-from-petsmart-charities.html) from the US report that around 12% of pets \(dogs and cats\) are purebred.
1.11.5. Con: Purebred dogs and cats are less likely to be abandoned because they are expensive to buy, whereas mutts/moggies can be adopted from shelters for free.
1.11.5.1. Pro: Purebred dogs can cost [thousands of dollars](https://www.care.com/c/stories/6072/the-pros-and-cons-of-purebred-dogs/), which means that - generally speaking - most prospective owners make considered decisions when it comes to purchasing one.
1.11.5.2. Pro: This is particularly true for cats, as purebred cats are [rarer than](http://pictures-of-cats.org/the-reason-why-people-abandon-purebred-cats.html) purebred dogs.
1.11.5.3. Con: -> See 1.11.4.1.
1.12. Pro: Breeding facilities are often not licensed, do not treat animals adequately or do not have the proper conditions.
1.12.1. Con: In the UK new [legislation](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/22/puppies-cannot-bought-unless-mother-present-new-laws/) is being introduced to tackle the puppy mill problem. The new law will require all sellers to show potential buyers the puppies alongside their mothers before the sale. Breeders will also be banned from selling puppies they have not bred themselves, and online ads will have to include the seller's licence number, the country of origin and the country of residence of the pet being advertised.
1.12.2. Pro: Puppy mills usually keep dogs in overcrowded and unsanitary [conditions](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills).
1.12.2.1. Pro: Dogs bred in puppy mills do not get to socialise, [experience](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills) toys, walks, exercise or basic grooming.
1.12.2.1.1. Pro: As puppies from puppy mills are usually removed from their mothers and littermates as early as 6 weeks old, they often do not get [socialised](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills) properly. This results in various behavioural problems throughout their lives.
1.12.2.1.1.1. Pro: Fearfulness, shyness, aggression and anxiety are common behavioural problems in dogs that were not adequately socialised.
1.12.2.2. Pro: Some puppy mills will keep all dogs outside in cages, where they are exposed to the [elements](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills) all year round.
1.12.2.2.1. Pro: Hyperthermia and hypothermia are common causes of death for dogs constantly kept outside.
1.12.2.3. Pro: In some puppy mills dogs are kept inside in cages, never being able to experience the [outdoors](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills).
1.12.3. Pro: Kitten mills similarly have [appalling conditions](https://www.petful.com/animal-welfare/kitten-mills/), and only care about profit.
1.12.4. Pro: It is not only dogs and cats that fall prey to mills: [ferrets](https://www.peta.org/features/investigation-exposes-cruelty-ferret-mill/), [rats](http://www.itsaratsworld.com/say-no-to-pet-mills/), [guinea pigs](https://www.thedodo.com/petco-petsmart-pet-supplier-abuse-1563393540.html), [rabbits](https://www.thedodo.com/petco-petsmart-pet-supplier-abuse-1563393540.html), etc. Almost every conceivable domestic animal can be and has been subjected to breeding mills.
1.12.5. Con: In the US,[laws](https://www.animallaw.info/topic/table-state-laws-concerning-minimum-age-sale-puppies) mandate that puppies not be separated from their litter mates or mothers before eight weeks in order to ensure their proper development.
1.12.6. Con: [Reputable breeders](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/01/should-we-stop-keeping-pets-why-more-and-more-ethicists-say-yes) provide a viable alternative to puppy mills.
1.12.7. Pro: Banning selective breeding could shut down many dog farms and illicit breeding organisations which breed purely for profit.
1.12.8. Pro: Puppy mills are only focused on making a [profit](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills) and have little regard for the health of the resulting dogs.
1.12.8.1. Pro: Dogs in puppy mills usually do not get adequate food, water and veterinary [care](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills).
1.12.8.1.1. Pro: To maximise profits, female dogs are bred at every opportunity with little to no recovery time between litters. When they are physically depleted to the point that they no longer can reproduce, breeding females are often [killed](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills).
1.12.8.1.2. Pro: Puppies sold this way often arrive to their new homes with various [diseases and infirmities](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills), including giardia, parvovirus, distemper, upper respiratory infections, kennel cough, pneumonia, mange, fleas, ticks, intestinal parasites, heartworm and chronic diarrhoea.
1.12.8.2. Pro: Puppy mills often do not remove sick dogs from their breeding pool, which means that puppies from these types of breeding facilities are prone to congenital and hereditary [health conditions](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills).
1.12.8.2.1. Pro: [Hereditary health conditions](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/puppy-mills/closer-look-puppy-mills) in dogs bred in puppy mills can include epilepsy, heart disease, kidney disease, muscoskeletal disorders \(e.g. hip dysplasia\), endocrine disorders, blood disorders, deafness, eye problems and respiratory disorders.
1.12.9. Con: In the US, in addition to the Animal Welfare Act 1966, a large number of states have passed new laws aimed at eliminating the worst aspects of puppy mills.
1.12.10. Con: In the UK the [Breeding and Sale of Dogs \(Welfare\) Act 1996](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/11/contents) was passed to regulate the welfare of dogs kept in commercial breeding establishments, to extend powers of inspection, to establish records of dogs kept in such establishments etc.
1.12.11. Con: -> See 1.11.3.1.
1.13. Con: Some purebred dogs are used professionally \(e.g. guide dogs, police dogs, search-and-rescue\). The vital tasks they perform may be lost if purebreds are prohibited.
1.13.1. Pro: Those [who work with](https://dogwellnet.com/content/health-and-breeding/breeding/breeding-for-health/population-breed-level-approach/inherited-defects-in-pedigree-dogs-parts-1-and-2-r291/) guide dogs report that the reliable temperament of purebred animals is required for their role.
1.13.2. Con: Professional dogs often suffer [stress](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/us/more-military-dogs-show-signs-of-combat-stress.html?pagewanted=all) and may have [shorter work lives](http://www.shoreservicedogs.com/considering1.shtml), depending on the type of work they do.
1.13.2.1. Con: This is not so much an argument against selective breeding, but against how animals are used. If animals were not selectively bred, arguably suitable 'mutts' would be used to fill these roles.
1.13.3. Pro: A large number of breeds were developed to assist hunters in various tasks. These breeds have special abilities that make them suitable for tasks that not all dogs could perform.
1.13.3.1. Con: While it's true that many breeds were developed to do certain tasks, most of those tasks are no longer done by dogs, but by using modern [technology](https://www.lowes.com/search?searchTerm=animal+trap) or [chemicals](https://www.domyown.com/burrowing-animals-ap-4749.html) instead.
1.13.3.2. Pro: Hounds track and chase prey. Sighthounds are able to follow prey by keeping up with its speed; scenthounds have a powerful sense of smell and can follow prey by tracking its scent.
1.13.3.3. Pro: Terriers are used to control rats, rabbits, foxes and badgers. Due to their size, speed and abilities they are able to find, track or trail quarry, especially underground, and to catch and kill small vermin.
1.13.3.4. Pro: Dachshunds were developed to scent, chase and flush out badgers and other burrow-welling animals and to hunt small prey such as rabbits.
1.13.3.5. Pro: Gun dogs assist hunters in finding and retrieving game \(usually birds\). The group includes pointers and setters \(that guide the hunter toward the quarry\), retrievers \(that retrieve game without harming it\), flushing spaniels \(that flush out quarry from dense bush\) and water dogs \(that retrieve game from the water\).
1.13.4. Pro: Pastoral dogs - including herding dogs and guard dogs - were specifically bred to be able to help shepherds herd and protect their flock.
1.13.5. Pro: Police dogs have to be intelligent, aggressive, strong, and have a good sense of smell. This set of criteria makes a handful of breeds ideal for the job - for example German shepherd, Belgian malinois, bloodhound etc.
1.13.5.1. Con: Police can train non-purebred dogs to fulfil  these roles, as they are doing in some parts of the [US](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/police-departments-adopting-pit-bull-dogs-save-money-euthanised-training-a7367821.html).
1.13.6. Con: Some purebred animals were developed according to specific working capabilities. When these high-energy animals, that sometimes require more attention, end up as family pets, problems often arise.
1.13.6.1. Pro: For example three purebred dogs: the Boston terrier; the French Bulldog; and the bulldog, have [caesarian section rates](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2009.00902.x/abstract) of more than 80%. Thus they are essentially totally dependent on humans.
1.13.6.2. Pro: There is [evidence](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1574688/Pedigree-dogs-are-dumped-in-record-numbers.html) from the UK that a number of exercise-intensive purebred dogs have been abandoned, probably because they were too much work to care for.
1.13.7. Pro: [A large study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172720), which controlled for environmental variables, found that there were behavioural differences between purebred and mixed-breed dogs. Thus some purebred dogs may be better to fill certain roles.
1.14. Pro: Purebred animals have an unacceptably high level of health problems.
1.14.1. Pro: A number of purebred animals directly suffer from the characteristics they are bred for.
1.14.1.1. Pro: The famous skin folds of the [Chinese Shar-Pei](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/dogs-that-changed-the-world-selective-breeding-problems/1281/), so valued by breeders and owners, can become breeding grounds for bacteria that cause frequent skin infections.
1.14.1.2. Pro: [Bloodhounds](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/dogs-that-changed-the-world-selective-breeding-problems/1281/), known for their low-slung eyelids, often suffer eye irritation and infection.
1.14.1.3. Pro: [Giant dogs](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/dogs-that-changed-the-world-selective-breeding-problems/1281/), such as mastiffs, Saint Bernards and great Danes are nearly too big for their own good - researchers have found a strong correlation between a dog's large size and the frequency of orthopaedic problems, such as hip dysplasia.
1.14.1.4. Con: The fault can be considered to lie in the particular choice of traits, rather than choosing traits overall.
1.14.1.5. Pro: Spanish Pachón Navarro and the Turkish Catalburun are [intentionally bred](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579364/) for a developmental defect: a cleft palate.
1.14.1.6. Pro: [Brachycephalic airway syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579364/) is a condition that afflicts dogs with intentionally flattened skulls such as pugs, bulldogs, and Boston terriers.
1.14.1.6.1. Pro: [Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/pugs-and-bulldogs-why-do-wethink-its-normal-to-watch-themchoke/) \(BOAS\) affects nearly all pugs, bulldogs and French bulldogs. Yet a study has shown that the owners of over half of the dogs diagnosed with BOAS thought that their dog did not have breathing problems, and found their dog's noisy, snuffling breathing as 'cute'.
1.14.1.6.2. Pro: The [popularity](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/12/french-bulldogs-set-knock-labradors-top-spot-become-uks-popular/) of these dogs is soaring, despite the fact that selective breeding has caused most of them to suffer from breathing difficulties and other health conditions.
1.14.1.6.3. Pro: The work of [CRUFFA](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cruffa/about/), a group of activists campaigning to stop using flat-faced breeds in advertisements, has been endorsed by The [British Veterinary Association](https://www.bva.co.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/newsroom/news-releases/top-vet-dog-tired-of-pug-health-problems-highlights-bbc-radio-4-today/) and many other animal welfare charities.
1.14.2. Pro: In-breeding and small genetic pools make purebred animals more prone to health complications.
1.14.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.8.2.1.
1.14.2.2. Pro: Using "[popular sires](http://www.instituteofcaninebiology.org/the-pox-of-popular-sires.html)" is particularly egregious as it allows negative traits to spread throughout the population. Recessive traits from these sires can remain hidden before surfacing several generations later at which point they are already, sadly, ubiquitous.
1.14.2.2.1. Pro: It is believe that haemophilia amongst German Shepards can be [traced back](http://www.humanesociety.org/news/magazines/2010/05-06/the_purebred_paradox_p2.html?credit=web_id145418212) to a single male dog from1968.
1.14.2.3. Con: [Crossbreeding in dogs](http://dogs.lovetoknow.com/dog-breeding-pregnancy/advantages-disadvantages-cross-breeding-dogs) is not without risk of serious congenital health risks either, as genetic risk factors can be found across multiple different breeds.
1.14.2.4. Pro: [In all 50](https://dogwellnet.com/content/health-and-breeding/breeding/breeding-for-health/population-breed-level-approach/inherited-defects-in-pedigree-dogs-parts-1-and-2-r291/) of the most popular purebred dog breeds in the UK, at least one trait sought by breeders correlated with an inherited health condition.
1.14.2.5. Pro: Many [kennel clubs](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/registration/how-to-register-your-dog/breed-register-pedigree/) have registration rules that require both the sire \(male parent\) and dam \(female parent\) to be registered with the kennel club as a purebred dog. This sets up a "[breed barrier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579364/)" resulting in a closed, homogenous population.
1.14.2.5.1. Pro: As [an example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579364/) the Jack Russel Terrier \(not recognised a purebred dog\) is significantly more genetically diverse than a very similar dog, the Parson Russell Terrier, which is recognised by the UK Kennel Club.
1.14.2.6. Con: -> See 1.5.4.2.
1.14.3. Con: The genetic health problems facing cats could not be mitigated through banning purebreeds; health problems need to be assessed and treated on their merits, without scapegoating selective breeding. \([Ch. 10](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cat-Sense-Feline-Enigma-Revealed/dp/0241960452)\)
1.14.4. Con: In dogs, crossbreeding may prove [more dangerous](http://dogs.lovetoknow.com/dog-breeding-pregnancy/advantages-disadvantages-cross-breeding-dogs) than in-breeding: various pups can be different sizes or crossed with large-skulled variants that make pregnancy and delivery extremely difficult.
1.14.4.1. Con: The same disadvantages can be present in purebred dogs, such as the [bulldog](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/although-purebred-dogs-can-be-best-in-show-are-they-worst-in-health/). Breeders frequently turn to artificial insemination because the female bulldog’s bone structure cannot support the male’s weight during mating. Most cannot give birth naturally either, because the puppies’ heads are too big for the birth canal.
1.14.5. Con: -> See 1.5.3.
1.14.6. Pro: A bulldog's altered figure makes it nearly impossible for them to reproduce without assistance, and the facial changes cause severe breathing problems in a [third](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/although-purebred-dogs-can-be-best-in-show-are-they-worst-in-health/) of all bulldogs.
1.14.7. Con: Discouraging unhealthy and unethical breeding can be done with animal welfare laws and oversight changes rather than requiring a blanket prohibition.
1.14.7.1. Pro: Failure when executing a method may be a consequence of faults in the execution, not the method. Specifically, the health problems facing purebred animals may stem from poor practise amongst breeders rather than selective breeding in general.
1.14.8. Pro: Genetic diversity allows animals to adapt to environmental change, have long and healthy lives, have a higher variation of alleles and be more likely to survive and produce offspring.
