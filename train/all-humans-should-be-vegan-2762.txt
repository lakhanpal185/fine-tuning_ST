Discussion Title: All Humans Should Be Vegan.

1. All humans should be vegan.
1.1. Con: Humans should feel free to choose any food they want.
1.1.1. Con: Choices are and will always be limited.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Humans can't eat metal or grass, they can't consume certain drugs.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Some drugs are regulated due to the harm and psychological effects they cause. Meat doesn't have the psychological altering effects as those drugs.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Metal is not food and humans can consume grass.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Wheatgrass](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/wheatgrass#1) is an edible type of grass.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Humans will not be able to have a choice when meat runs out anyway \(such as when every fish gets caught in the ocean or when a species goes extinct\).
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: In a vegan world, species would not be as endangered anymore, some species would not go extinct.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Fish and other ocean wildlife populations are [greatly reduced](https://lop.parl.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/bp434-e.htm#THE%20STATE%20OF%20THE%20WORLD'S%20FISHERIES\(txt\)) compared to a century ago, and a vegan society would allow those populations to rebuild and restore balance in the ocean.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: If everyone chose to be vegan, then it is a possible violation of the [food chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_chain). Animals might overwhelm us.
1.1.1.2.1.3. Con: In order to grow crops we already mass extinct certain lifeforms. Middle Europe for instance is almost insect free leading to a mass starvation of birds and other animals living of those insects. Germany has lost [75%](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insektensterben) of its insect biomass due to modern agriculture.
1.1.1.2.1.4. Con: Domestic animals were bred by humans throughout history. They are not capable of living in the wilderness now and will go extinct if they had to.
1.1.1.2.1.5. Pro: "[Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, and habitat destruction](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)."
1.1.1.2.1.6. Con: Animals are not threatened if they are provided legal protections from mass exploitation or extinction.
1.1.1.2.1.6.1. Con: Individual animal lives are endangered in any slaughterhouse, by definition, however restrictive and well applied the laws may be. The focus of veganism is not only the preservation of species as a whole, but the reduction of suffering inflicted upon animals as sentient individuals.
1.1.1.2.1.7. Con: [Cowspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowspiracy) is not a credible source.
1.1.1.2.1.7.1. Con: Cowspiracy is not a source on its own, it is an aggregator. Its sources can be found at: [cowspiracy.com](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/)
1.1.1.2.1.8. Pro: Over [100,000 species](http://www.worldanimalfoundation.org/articles/article/8949042/186425.htm) per year go extinct in large part due to animal agriculture.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Animals reproduce, some very quickly. Sustainable farming practices realistically preclude the possibility of a livestock species going extinct, [including fish](https://grist.org/food/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-fish-farming-but-were-afraid-to-ask/).
1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Industrial farming is driving the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth, [says leading academic](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/mass-extinction-life-on-earth-farming-industrial-agriculture-professor-raj-patel-a7914616.html) at the "the [Extinction and Livestock Conference](http://www.extinctionconference.com)"
1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Sustainable farming practices do not have these problems. This fails as a criticism of farming as a whole.
1.1.1.3. Pro: People aren't completely free to choose what to eat since [advertising](https://www.mnn.com/money/sustainable-business-practices/stories/the-marketing-of-meat-why-beef-and-pork-producers-are) is prominent in our culture, [affecting the decision making process](https://lifehacker.com/5824328/how-advertising-manipulates-your-choices-and-spending-habits-and-what-to-do-about-it).
1.1.1.4. Con: Limiting choices available to others without a clear moral reason is immoral since it undermines their free will. Stating that "Oh well, choices are limited" is not a good reason for example to discourage abortions.
1.1.2. Con: That's speciesist. What about the choice of the non-human animal being chosen as "food"? Certainly they would much rather be free and not raised and slaughtered for a sandwich.
1.1.2.1. Con: Livestock animals don't have the necessary intelligence to understand that, or to make that choice.
1.1.3. Pro: While there are more merits to being vegan, the proper statement should be "all humans ought to be vegan" as ultimately, what one eats is entirely their choice.
1.1.3.1. Con: It is not. This "choice" is a not only a result of education but also one of massive propaganda through tens of millions in Lobbying and 24/7 advertising. It is an industry after all defending its own interests. It is also a result of quasi complete ignorance, judgement mechanisms and consent fabrication operated on self, since childhood.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: People tend to be selfish, and the propaganda just feeds into this individualism without either side looking at the consequences of such decisions.
1.1.3.2. Con: People getting to eat what they want would make sense if meat is sustainable. However, being unsustainable, not everything that people eat will be their choice. If we run out of meat, then the first person that picked meat got their way for their choice, whereas the next person doesn't. Thus, what one eats is not entirely their choice, but instead dictated by their environment \(a.k.a. what's available\).
1.1.3.3. Con: Choice only makes sense if people's actions do not affect anyone else's. Once it affects others, people's choices do not get to be entirely their own.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Meat gets treated like a [public good](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-good.asp), because everyone needs to eat food and most people eat meat. However, it cannot support everyone. Vegan foods are more of public goods than meat is, so they should replace meat.
1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Meat is more of a [quasi-public good](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-good.asp), because it is unsustainable \(a.k.a. one person's food choices depletes another's\), whereas veganism is more sustainable and acceptable by the public, making it more of a public good. Thus, veganism is what the public should strive towards.
1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Meat is more likely to run into the free rider problem \([1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/public-good.asp), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good#Free_rider_problem)\) than veganism. Meat takes more resources to accomplish, which makes it harder to contribute to than veganism.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: This leads to the issue where people starve in an omnivore world. When one person takes more than they contribute, another person has nothing to take, because they did not give enough either or gave enough, but the resource is already taken by the free rider.
1.1.3.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: In a vegan world, this is less of a worry. Efficiency is greater, which lowers the bar for contributing to the public good. This allows for more access for all and less of one person taking from another.
1.1.3.3.1.2.2. Pro: The free rider problem is an example of a market failure. Veganism is the way to go, because it is less likely to run into this type of market failure, making it better for the economy's functioning and sustainability.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Veganism is more beneficial to the [common good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good) than meat is, because it is more beneficial for all and better achieved through citizenship than meat.
1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Vegan foods are easier to make [common goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good_%28economics%29) than meat is, because their lower prices makes the non-exclusivity part of creating them as common goods more feasible to accomplish.
1.1.3.4. Pro: Some people feel the need to eat meat \(both for health or for their body asking for it\). It's unfair to prohibit it.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: If the transition to veganism is gradual, then people's bodies can change gradually towards eating vegan food \(both for their health and body\). The transition will be fair, because people will not seek meat anymore. Then, we can focus on the new demand for veganism without worry about causing issues for anyone.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: One day when the change to veganism occurs, no one will want to meat anymore \(because their bodies adapted to the new diet\). Even though it is unfair now to prohibit it \(because people crave meat\), with the transition, it will be unfair to keep meat around, because people will find it repulsive. Society finds ways to remove what is repulsive, because it is not conducive to be around \(no one wants to be around it\).
1.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: People do not need to eat meat, because they tend to be healthier on a vegan diet. If they are lacking in their new diet, they can find ways to make it healthier \(like not eat junk food and supplement what they are missing\).
1.1.3.4.1.3. Pro: People's taste buds change to their diet \([1](https://plantproof.com/taste-buds-will-they-change/), [2](https://nutritionfacts.org/2014/06/24/want-to-be-healthier-change-your-taste-buds/)\), so one day their body \(i.e. their tongue and brain\) will stop asking for meat.
1.1.3.4.2. Con: It should be very fair and even beneficial, because people's unhealthy diets are causing their bodies to get unbalanced \(such as [becoming obese](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2018/03/21/Obesity-linked-to-death-of-taste-buds-change-in-diet/9291521638015/), which [meat causes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697260/)\) and crave something that is not good for them. If we remove what is causing people to become ill, then people will be healthier and society will be better off.
1.1.3.4.3. Con: If one argues that it is unfair to force another into doing something they don't want, the logical conclusion is that forcing animals into captivity and untimely deaths is also unfair.
1.1.3.5. Pro: Being able to make a vegan choice or non vegan choice is an important freedom. When we can engage in a balanced decision process, we are more likely to see diverse outcomes \(that move towards total veganism\) e.g. eating much less meat/ only eating meat at traditional festivities
1.1.4. Con: Every culture limits the freedom of choice regarding meat consumption, with some animals being considered improper for consumption.
1.1.4.1. Con: Unless you count cannibalism, Western culture doesn't really care what you eat.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Eating dogs or cats would cause a massive outcry in most Western countries.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Humans should be able to choose to eat anything they like, like dogs, cats, apes, other humans etc, but can't because they aren't allowed to. In meat eating societies, they have bans on these, because these actions are offensive to others or problematic.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: There is nothing inherently wrong with eating dogs, cats, or apes. Some cultures already do, and it presents no genuine problems for them.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: If people can eat meat from livestock, then it is no different than consuming these other animals. People just have moral/ethical instead logical conflicts with eating meat from these sources.
1.1.4.2.3. Con: There are no problems inherent with eating any of those animals, but they cannot be lumped together with cannibalism, which is a completely different thing. Humans should, in fact, be able to choose to eat anything they like, short of committing a crime.
1.1.4.2.4. Pro: [Eating pets](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/man-bites-dog-its-legal-to-eat-dogs-and-cats-in-44-states-101714.html), [endangered species](https://www.alternet.org/story/145668/endangered_species_on_the_grill%3A_the_black_market_in_illegal_meat_flourishes_in_the_us) like apes, and [cannibalism](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-ridiculous-law-in-every-state-2014-2) are banned in some US states and due to their dangers.
1.1.4.2.4.1. Pro: People eating endangered animals, such as apes, could be devastating to the environment if they go extinct.
1.1.4.2.5. Con: It is the bans themselves that are offensive and problematic rather than eating these animals. Carnism \([1](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/carnism-why-eating-animals-is-a-social-justice-issue/), [2](https://www.carnism.org/carnism), [3](https://www.farmsanctuary.org/learn/carnism/)\) is an is an invisible oppressive system that is a form of speciesism. It creates 'paradoxical mentality' and hinders social justice through our food system.
1.1.4.2.5.1. Pro: Children are often not educated on the source of their food and distracted from their natural empathy for animals. The artificial divide between animals which are okay to eat and those that are not begins with parenting.
1.1.4.3. Pro: With all humans being vegan, we would create worldwide limits on the freedom of choice for meat consumption, because all animals would be considered improper.
1.1.4.4. Con: The amount of people who support/oppose certain actions does not speak for or against the action.
1.1.5. Con: This is a loaded statement, a "begging the question" fallacy where the word 'food' is used to make the statement seem reasonable.

The crux of the vegan argument is, like not eating fellow humans, non-humans should also be regarded as non-food for humans.

So, yes humans should be free to choose any food they wish, but animals are not food.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Prizing animals over other sources for protein is a man-made decision, not a natural one, especially with the [discovery of fire](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-fire-makes-us-human-72989884/).
1.1.5.2. Con: As animals are frequently eaten by carnivores and omnivores alike, including humans, it is factually inaccurate to say that animals are not food.
1.1.5.3. Pro: If a higher developed, more intelligent species were to invade our planet and develop a taste for human flesh, no human would advertise the invaders' rights to eat what they want. We would want them to recognize our will to live and find something else to eat. If we put ourselves above animals because of our higher intellect, that intellect also compels us to treat those who are dependent on us with their best interests in mind.
1.1.6. Con: We should limit actions of humans which have negative effects on other humans. For example, the environmental impacts of animal agriculture.
1.1.6.1. Pro: A vegan society would be better off for the environment.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: A vegan society would best combat climate change.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Less fields to grow crops results in [more](https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/cattle-ranching) [area](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldOfChange/deforestation.php) with forests, which [reduce carbon emissions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1433831915000463).
1.1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Monoculture forestry can cause more environmental issues than they solve, because they cut down more forest that is absorbs more carbon than the plants put there instead.
1.1.6.1.1.1.2. Con: Livestock feed, including grass for pasture based livestock, are carbon sinks. Removing those crops \(especially in areas that have no plants normally, like deserts\) would be worse for the planet.
1.1.6.1.1.2. Pro: A vegan diet [would](https://www.culinaryschools.org/yum/vegetables/) create less greenhouse gas emissions, require less water, and use less land for its food production.
1.1.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: It could reduce by two thirds greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 according to [Oxford University](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-03-22-veggie-based-diets-could-save-8-million-lives-2050-and-cut-global-warming) and here is the [scientific publication](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/03/16/1523119113.full) with figures.
1.1.6.1.1.2.2. Con: The biggest water burden in California  is from high water demand crops such as almonds
1.1.6.1.1.2.3. Pro: The meat industry [contributes](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/21/eat-less-meat-vegetarianism-dangerous-global-warming) to global warming.
1.1.6.1.1.2.4. Con: Making farming practices holistic will [reduce emissions leading to sustainability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI).
1.1.6.1.1.2.5. Con: Water-resource is never wasted, that would be against the laws of nature, but the Money to bring the water to the animals/plants now that is wasted.
1.1.6.1.1.2.6. Pro: Methane from the gas output of grazing and dairy cows, along with other processing, constitutes [4%](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/41348/icode/) of green house gases that affect the entire world.  Excrement runoff from pig farms, no less, [pollutes waterways](http://www.earthtimes.org/business/environmental-impact-disposal-waste-large-scale-pig-production/433/) to a measurable ecological detriment.
1.1.6.1.1.2.6.1. Con: All that could be easily managed by setting regulations to use that methane from cows themselves and digested from their manure for energy production.
1.1.6.1.1.2.7. Pro: Over [18%](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/18/vegetarianism-save-planet-environment) of greenhouse gases are due to animal agriculture.
1.1.6.1.1.2.7.1. Con: Without using ruminant animals to mimic the herds we will [create deserts](https://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change).  Far more carbon is sequestered by the natural cycle of life then you ever will have gobal warming with cow farts.
1.1.6.1.1.2.7.1.1. Pro: Properly managed regenerative farming of livestock in brittle environments \(those prone to desertification\) is crucial for improving ecological systems and sequestering carbon. So even if we don't eat the livestock we need them on the land. [Holistic Management](https://holisticmanagement.org/)
1.1.6.1.1.2.7.2. Pro: A vegan's diet's [carbon footprint](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet) is estimated to be less than half that of a high meat diet.
1.1.6.1.1.3. Con: Even though most people eat too much meat, the world doesn't need to go vegan to reduce the environmental impact.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1. Pro: Humans probably should eat less meat, but this isn't an reason to stop eating meat altogether, especially free-range ethically farmed animals.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1.1. Con: There is a moral argument to stop eating meat altogether \(as well as fish and animal derived products\): animals are sentient beings with a will to live, and it is therefore more ethical to avoid inflicting suffering to other animals, for the same reason as it is more ethical to avoid inflicting suffering to other human beings.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Free range chickens are still slaughtered, selectively bred for rapid growth to a point where for some, their legs can't support them, and kept in overcrowded barns. Free Range doesn't equal a happy life for the animal.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1.3. Pro: Certain forms of privately maintained animal rearing are not harmful, for instance keeping a chicken in your backyard.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1.3.1. Con: Not all people can have a backyard chicken, as they can conflict with laws \(especially zoning\). Going against the laws could get people into legal trouble.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: Other animals would be much harder yet to raise by their size alone. They would be harder to conceal, making owners much more likely to get into trouble.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1.3.2. Con: Many chickens have been bred to produce more eggs than is healthy for them to do so. This is because their calcium can become [severely depleted](https://mikethechickenvet.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/bones-shells-and-hen-health/), and it is difficult to feed them enough to overcome this.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1.3.3. Con: Most backyard chickens are hens \(females\). Most of the cocks \(males\) will have been killed at hatching.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1.3.4. Con: Most backyard chickens are still killed for food once they stop laying frequently.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1.3.4.1. Con: Get your eggs from another yard.
1.1.6.1.1.3.1.3.5. Con: While keeping a single chicken may well not be cruel the demand for meat far outstrips that. It is not feasible to support the world on this small scale farming, thus by not being vegan humans are forced to turn to crueler methods.
1.1.6.1.1.3.2. Con: If billions of people eat "just a little amount of meat" system is not sustainable.
1.1.6.1.1.4. Con: People might drive around more on a vegan diet to find vegan options \(due to living in a [food desert](https://www.cdc.gov/features/FoodDeserts/index.html)\). This contributes to global warming more if the vehicle is not fuel efficient.
1.1.6.1.1.4.1. Pro: Since processed vegan food \(like substitutes\) are [more expensive](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/the-challenge-of-going-vegan/) than animal products, people might drive around more looking for cheaper, more affordable options to satisfy their cravings.
1.1.6.1.1.4.2. Con: The extra fuel an individual may use initially to find vegan products is minuscule compared to the emissions from the animal agriculture industry.
1.1.6.1.1.4.3. Con: This claim makes no sense - when the demand for vegan products rise, the supply for them also rises. Thus, driving around would not be an issue if everyone goes vegan.
1.1.6.1.1.4.4. Con: People who live in food deserts can get innovative with their vegan options. They may grow their own food, order online, or just buy foods that are not fresh but still healthy \(like dried fruit\). Thus, driving around will not be an issue as it will decrease as people get adjusted to their new diet.
1.1.6.1.1.4.5. Pro: This is significant, as driving is another major contributor of greenhouse gases towards climate change.
1.1.6.1.1.4.6. Pro: [Travel](https://www.popsci.com/g00/3_c-6bbb.utux78hn.htr_/c-6RTWJUMJZX77x24myyux78x3ax2fx2fbbb.utux78hn.htrx2fx78nyjx78x2futux78hn.htrx2fknqjx78x2fx78ydqjx78x2f100_6c_x2fuzgqnhx2fnrfljx78x2f7562x2f52x2fhqnrfyj-hmfslj-htsywngzynts_6.oulx3fnytpx3dwTvq4BNnx26khx3d05x2c05x26n65h.rfwpx3dnrflj_$/$/$/$/$/$/$/$/$/$/$) creates more greenhouse gases than the vegan diet prevents, which could increase when people change their behaviors to go vegan.
1.1.6.1.1.5. Con: Vegan society would be more dependent on imported foods, thus making the emission made by the worlds fleet of cargo ships even worse.
1.1.6.1.1.5.1. Con: The emissions that would come from increased transport would still [pale](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions) in comparison to emissions saved from the animal agriculture sector.
1.1.6.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Even though there are more emissions from transportation, the ones in animal agriculture are much worse, due to its type. If greenhouse gas effects were compared instead, the clear winner is animal agriculture. Methane from animals is [~35x](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jul/19/climatechange.climatechange) worse than CO2 from cars.
1.1.6.1.1.5.1.2. Con: Some of the numbers do not include [all of the steps](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jul/19/climatechange.climatechange) in the animal agriculture process, making the numbers inaccurate.
1.1.6.1.1.5.2. Con: The few % of the population that will rely more on imported food is insignificant. Only a few small or poorly populated countries without capabilities to grow food \(due to land size or geographic region\) will rely more on imported foods.
1.1.6.1.1.5.3. Con: If people go vegan, they tend to make [healthier and ethical choices](https://qz.com/91123/vegetarians-live-longer-but-its-not-because-they-dont-eat-meat/). In doing so, they will more likely pick local foods \(like at farmers markets\), because of their perceived eco and health value.
1.1.6.1.1.5.4. Pro: In the short-term, meat-heavy countries would rely on imports until the country can figure out how to grow its own produce.
1.1.6.1.1.5.5. Pro: Some countries that cannot grow crops easily \(such as political conflict regions that rely on mobile food like livestock\) will need imported food to survive.
1.1.6.1.1.6. Pro: One of these transitions towards reducing climate change is moving away from oil \(sourced from [plant and animal remains](https://answersingenesis.org/geology/the-origin-of-oil/), which is not really vegan\) and towards renewable energy like [solar](http://solargaines.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/How-Solar-Works-v2.png) and [wind](https://images.ecosia.org/XugO8KszOUN4TXxQML90yYkvRrM=/0x390/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fclaesjohnsonmathscience.files.wordpress.com%2F2009%2F02%2Fwindturbine1.jpg) \(their energy comes from vegan sources\).
1.1.6.1.1.7. Pro: The plants grown for food absorbs CO2, so they help to decrease this and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
1.1.6.1.1.8. Con: The high demand for kelp and seaweed based products is putting a lot of our oceans under threat from people that want to [farm these using unsustainable and seriously damaging farming methods such as dredging](https://www.aol.co.uk/news/2018/09/16/msps-urged-to-ban-mechanical-dredging-for-kelp/?guccounter=1). Research while in its early days is showing the positive effect that kelp beds and other fragile ocean based environments have on the [absorption of greenhouse gases](https://oceana.org/blog/seaweed-could-be-scrubbing-way-more-carbon-atmosphere-we-expected).
1.1.6.1.1.9. Con: Through agriculture we released as much carbon to atmosphere as from burning fossile fuels by eroding the top soil.
1.1.6.1.1.10. Con: Soil building grassland with grassing animals are an essential pillar to combat climate change and to restore soil. [The ecological argument: Putting carbon back where it belongs](https://youtu.be/wgmssrVInP0)
1.1.6.1.1.11. Con: The fertilizer used in agriculture is made from fossile fuels. Agriculture is heavily depending on fossile fuels.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: A vegan society would create the least pollution, which damages the environment.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: Meat production [poisons the air](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/18/vegetarianism-save-planet-environment). Nearly 40% of pesticides \(US\) and nearly two thirds of ammonia \(a major contributor to acid rain\) are used or produced in animal farming.
1.1.6.1.2.2. Con: A vegan society would increase the use of pesticides. In order to meet the demand \(and make money\), farmers and the firms behind them will be forced to use more and more pesticides and exceed the critical treshold we already reached in the use of chemicals in agricultural exploitation.
1.1.6.1.2.2.1. Con: A vegan world would not use more pesticides because we are already produce enough to feed the whole planet. But all this is used to feed animals, that make less food than what they eat \(and drink\). As you can see, a 60kg human has eaten way more than 60kg of food in his whole life.
1.1.6.1.2.3. Pro: Meat industry produces more pollution than all transportation and power plants [combined](http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Livestock%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf).
1.1.6.1.2.4. Pro: Leather is [biodegradable](http://www.truthaboutfur.com/blog/5-reasons-must-wear-leather-fur/), which is better for the environment \(less trash\) than plastic clothing.
1.1.6.1.2.5. Pro: Livestock is the most significant contributor to [nitrogen and phosphorus pollution](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions-agriculture) of streams, rivers and coastal waters worldwide.
1.1.6.1.2.5.1. Pro: This is really harmful to the underwater ecosystems, as [toxic algae blooms](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/toxic-algae-blooms-spreading/) grow \(and are getting worse\) from the runoff from farms that grow animals for meat.
1.1.6.1.2.5.2. Pro: [Cover crops](https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions-agriculture) are a solution to the problem, showing that vegan food production is the way to go to resolve the nitrogen/phosphorus pollution in waterways.
1.1.6.1.2.5.3. Con: Due to intensive farming required to produce agricultural produce for human consumption - while there are other alternatives silage is the cheapest way of fertilising the land and if used properly can reduce the leaching effect. Previously we had more trees, bushes and plants in buffer or runoff areas which absorbed a lot of the excess and acted as filters. Yet mans need for housing and infrastructures has meant that these have been greatly reduced.
1.1.6.1.2.6. Pro: The streams rivers lakes and waterways would be rejuvenated from removing feces sources as at the moment many waterways in America and possibly other countries are polluted with pig, cow and other animal feces making water unsafe to use and consume by humans. This is a human right issue and an environmental issue. A vegan society wouldn't need to accommodate for so many animals and therefore feces would be less.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: A vegan society offers the best way to manage resources.
1.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: There are and will be too many people on earth for everyone to eat meat.
1.1.6.1.3.1.1. Con: There is scarcity for essentially all resources, doesn't mean everyone should go without.
1.1.6.1.3.1.2. Con: There are other factors in world hunger other than not eating meat, such as access to and waste of food. Addressing these could potentially allow more people to live on Earth, even by eating meat.
1.1.6.1.3.1.3. Pro: Even though veganism is increasing rapidly in [multiple countries](https://www.plantbasednews.org/post/5-surprising-studies-that-prove-veganism-is-growing-around-the-world), the demand for meat worldwide is expected to [go up](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/wsfs/docs/Issues_papers/HLEF2050_Global_Agriculture.pdf) too as the population grows. All humans to being vegan would prevent this trend from happening before overpopulation effects due to eating meat cause the world population to peak and then decline.
1.1.6.1.3.1.4. Pro: We could stop world hunger or make food cheaper if we stopped eating meat. "We are currently growing enough food to feed 10 billion people." - [Cowspiracy](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
1.1.6.1.3.1.4.1. Pro: A vegan society would use less productivity on nutrition because nutrients found in meat can be obtained from plants more economically.
1.1.6.1.3.1.4.2. Pro: A vegan diet is the [most efficient](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts) way to use land. A vegan requires 1/6th of an acre for a year of food, a vegetarian needs three times that much, and a meat eater needs 18-fold more land than a vegan.
1.1.6.1.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: It is possible to cultivate [15 times more](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts) protein on any given area of land with soybeans rather than grazing cows.
1.1.6.1.3.2. Pro: Meat production strains scarce natural resources and environments.
1.1.6.1.3.2.1. Con: A vegan diet would strain the plant populations and most likely lead to surges in current animal populations, which we'd have nothing to do with and would be forced to compete with us for many plants, possibly causing starvation.
1.1.6.1.3.2.2. Con: This claim is an argument that less people should eat meat, or that people who eat meat should eat less, it does not in any way support the argument that "All" humans should be vegan.
1.1.6.1.3.2.3. Pro: Meat production leads to deforestation.
1.1.6.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: [6 million hectares](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/18/vegetarianism-save-planet-environment) of forest, twice the size of Belgium, and the same amount of wetlands, are lost every year due to farming. The majority of this farming is to directly support animals or grow their feed.
1.1.6.1.3.2.3.2. Pro: [91%](http://www.rainforestfoundation.org/agriculture/) of deforestation in rainforests is due to animal agriculture.
1.1.6.1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: ["Free-range, grassfed" cattle are "biggest single cause of global deforestation", "responsible for 80 percent of Amazonian deforestation"](https://foodrevolution.org/blog/the-truth-about-grassfed-beef/).
1.1.6.1.3.2.4. Pro: Meat production uses large amounts of scarce water.
1.1.6.1.3.2.4.1. Pro: [70%](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/18/vegetarianism-save-planet-environment) of the earth's fresh water is used for farming, and producing meat is far less water efficient than producing plants.
1.1.6.1.3.2.4.1.1. Con: In terms of water use, chicken is more efficient than most legumes and even broccoli when considering the value of protein in each food. Chicken is also more efficient than nuts as a measure of land area per unit protein produced.
1.1.6.1.3.2.4.1.1.1. Con: "The Water Footprint per gram of protein for milk, eggs and chicken meat \(around 30 L g−1 protein\) is 1.5 times larger than for pulses \(20 L g−1 protein\)." [Arjen Y Hoekstra](http://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Hoekstra-2014-Water-for-animal-products_1.pdf)
1.1.6.1.3.2.4.2. Pro: Between one and two thirds of fresh water resources are being used for animal agriculture. In the USA [30%](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/water-in-water-out/) of these resources are used on animal farming.
1.1.6.1.3.2.4.3. Pro: A vegan diet has a smaller [water footprint](http://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/product-water-footprint/water-footprint-crop-and-animal-products/) allowing more food to be produced given a constant amount of rainfall.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5. Pro: Meat production wastes food which could be used elsewhere.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.1. Pro: 36% of all crops grown are used to feed animals, which then we eat. There is a huge loss of energy in this system \(which is something basic we have all learned in middle school Biology\)[vox.com](https://www.vox.com/2014/8/21/6053187/cropland-map-food-fuel-animal-feed)
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.2. Pro: Producing 1 kg of grain-fed beef requires [7 kg of grain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/09/03/it-does-not-take-7-kg-of-grain-to-make-1-kg-of-beef-be-very-careful-with-your-statistics/#2430e94b5f0d).
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.2.1. Con: Cherry picking the one worst possible source of animal protein is an oversimplification.  Looking at greenhouse gas emissions per 1000 calories of food item, while beef requires 19.18 lbs of emissions, head lettuce requires 18.67 lbs, cucumbers 12.34, tomatoes 8.29, and poultry only 4.86.  [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/18/being-a-vegetarian-might-make-you-feel-environmentally-superior-why-that-may-be-wrong/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a84dace56239)
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.2.2. Con: This is an oversimplification, even in the strict case of beef, this figure is only representative of a sample of all beef production, namely [only in US, or US style feed lots.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/09/03/it-does-not-take-7-kg-of-grain-to-make-1-kg-of-beef-be-very-careful-with-your-statistics/#173258605f0d)
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3. Pro: If all humans were vegan, we would be more able to feed the population as it is and as it grows. Food grown for meat production would go to the people, as would water.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3.1. Pro: In the United States, replacing all animal-based items with plant-based replacement diets can add enough food to feed [350 million additional people](http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3804).
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3.2. Con: We already produce [more food](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-holt-gimenez/world-hunger_b_1463429.html) than we actually need, we could simply share it better. There is no need for veganism to do that.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.4. Pro: If we don't feed animals to then kill them or exploit for milk and eggs we can use the same amount of cereals and water to feed and give to people that are starving in the world.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.5. Pro: Meat wastes resources. According to [pyramid of biomass](https://biology.tutorvista.com/ecology/ecological-pyramid.html), it takes 10x the amount of food for animals to consume than it creates for humans \(for example, 200kg of feed makes 20kg of meat\).
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.5.1. Pro: Too much fertile land is used to feed animals \(like grain grown for cattle\). This could be used to feed more humans \(or be left to nature\).
1.1.6.1.3.2.6. Pro: Meat production wastes land which could be used for other purposes.
1.1.6.1.3.2.6.1. Pro: Free-range, grass-fed beef would require even more land \([30% more](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320015635/http://extension.psu.edu/animals/beef/grass-fed-beef/articles/telling-the-grass-fed-beef-story)\) than grain-fed. If the switch occurred in the US, the gain in land would be size of [3/4 of Texas](http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/2/2/127/htm). This take more land away from wildlife, which would be a detriment to their livable space.
1.1.6.1.3.2.6.1.1. Pro: [Grazing also has many other negative effects on ecosystems when cattle are raised in them](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7439/94722c6326433a10044898eabd0bcab3f4b3.pdf).
1.1.6.1.3.2.6.1.2. Pro: Following the articles, grass-fed beef creates 500% more greenhouse gases and uses 35% more water than grain-fed.
1.1.6.1.3.2.6.1.3. Pro: What makes this is worse is that grass-fed beef is [trending](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/grass-fed-beef-is-just-as-bad-for-the-environment-as-grain-fed/) over grain-fed due to people wanting to eat healthier foods.
1.1.6.1.3.2.6.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.3.2.1.
1.1.6.1.3.2.6.2. Pro: Currently the rate of raising lifestock on more and more land is not sustainable but more people could be fed in a sustainable fashion if the land used for raising life stock were instead used for growing nutrient dense edible plants.
1.1.6.1.3.2.6.3. Pro: As civilization grows, people will need more space and meat will need to be squeezed out for accommodate them, because meat takes up too much space that people need.
1.1.6.1.3.2.6.3.1. Pro: This is especially true for when people move to cities, as meat will be much harder to grow near or in cities than crops \(which can easily grow in buildings, like apartments or vertical farms\).
1.1.6.1.3.2.7. Pro: Domesticated animals that get released into the wild could become invasive and devastate ecosystems. One such example is [feral swine](http://www.vainvasivespecies.org/species/feral-swine).
1.1.6.1.3.2.8. Con: The real issue is not about being vegan/omnivorous: it's about intensive breeding and industries of junk food. The Alps are full of farms and little companies that produce salame, cheese, etc. This it is 100  times more environmentally friendly and animal-life respectful than bigger industries that produce vegetable products. If the whole world became vegan it would just penalize little farms like these ones.
1.1.6.1.3.2.8.1. Con: Land used to facilitate animal agriculture \(pasture, grain etc\) currently takes up around 30% of the earth's landmass. That's including all the horrific, high concentration meat factories that produce 100x more than these utopian farms per year. The space needed to produce 'enough' meat in these apparently Utopian farms to feed even a tenth of the world population would be [more land mass](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM) than we have. The space would be better utilised on vegetables.
1.1.6.1.3.2.9. Con: Having no humans is good for the environment.  While it may be technically true, it's not realistic; nor is it realistic to expect the world to be vegan.
1.1.6.1.3.2.10. Con: Extensive plant farming damages natural fauna by reclaiming its territory.
1.1.6.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.4.1.1.
1.1.6.1.3.4. Con: A vegan diet is [less sustainable](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/earth/going-vegan-isnt-actually-th/).
1.1.6.1.3.4.1. Con: A vegan diet is [more](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/infographic-veganism-and-the-environment/) [sustainable](https://www.veganismbythenumbers.com) [than](https://greenerideal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vegan-environment.jpg) our current diet, though it is not absolutely ideal.
1.1.6.1.3.5. Con: Only if people eat the foods that use [little water and resources to grow \(such as fruits, vegetables, and sweeteners like lettuce, tomatoes, and cane sugar\) instead of ones that use more than meat \(such as seeds like chocolate, coffee, and vanilla\)](http://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Mekonnen-Hoekstra-2011-WaterFootprintCrops.pdf).
1.1.6.1.3.6. Pro: Animal products going to waste are [much worse](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/08/150814091148.htm) and [more likely](http://www.fao.org/save-food/resources/keyfindings/en/) than vegan foods to go to waste.
1.1.6.1.3.6.1. Pro: Animal product waste does not stop when [resources are strained](https://www.truthordrought.com/single-post/2016/08/30/Drought-Stricken-California-Water-Contributes-to-US-Dairy-Cheese-%E2%80%9CSurplus%E2%80%9D), such as [during a drought](https://www.truthordrought.com/single-post/2016/10/13/Guess-Who-Dumped-13200-Olympic-Pools-Worth-of-California-Water), when they should be conserved instead. Vegan foods would lessen the cause of and recovery from natural disasters easier.
1.1.6.1.3.6.2. Pro: The difference \(between vegan and non-vegan foods\) really separates when foods are processed \(more waste occurs then\).
1.1.6.1.3.6.3. Pro: Biochar could avoid the inadequacies of decomposing \(such as a [lack of breaking down without nitrogen](https://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/gardening-techniques/building-garden-soil-wood-mulch-zmaz10onzraw)\), because it allows [unusable plant material to be utilized by the soil](https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/biochar-how-build-soil-lock-carbon-build-fertility-farm).
1.1.6.1.3.6.4. Con: Eventually all food breaks down into fertilizer, but animal products and plants have equally difficult byproducts that require more processing and take longer to break down, from [bones](https://ekko.world/how-to-recycle-bones/177451) to [nut shells](http://thegreenhome.co.uk/feature/uses-for-pistachio-shells/).
1.1.6.1.3.6.5. Pro: Whole, minimally-processed vegan foods require [less refrigeration](https://imgur.com/a/kZKCVDB) than animal products, which spoil quickly. The less food waste and refrigeration, combined with a long shelf life, makes vegan food much cheaper and more feasible for less privileged individuals/societies too than animal products do.
1.1.6.1.3.6.5.1. Con: There are exceptions to this, such as powdered milk and jerky, which have long shelf-lives.
1.1.6.1.3.6.5.2. Con: To create a "well-planned" vegan diet, vegan rely on many produce that are extremely fragil and need extensive cooling. Many fruits need to be riped in cool-house for several weeks.
1.1.6.1.3.7. Pro: Vegan products are more energy efficient.
1.1.6.1.3.7.1. Pro: Fur coats are [unnecessary](http://www.haveyoupackedthecamera.com/blog/articles/antarctica/antarcticaClothingOuterLayer.htm) for warm in all conditions, and it is also requires [15x](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1366983/How-ethical-fur-fashion-industrys-cynical-yet.html) as much energy to produce than non-fur equivalents.
1.1.6.1.3.7.2. Pro: Growing and producing meat consumes more [fossil fuel energy](http://www.worldwatch.org/node/549) than plant-based food.
1.1.6.1.3.8. Pro: Non-traditional farming methods \(like vertical farming \([1](http://www.verticalfarm.nl/), [2](https://www.wur.nl/nl/Dossiers/dossier/Verticale-landbouw.htm)\)\) developing in modern society will be best accomplished with crops instead of livestock.
1.1.6.1.3.9. Con: Not all land is fertile enough to grow crops with high enough vitamin and mineral levels to sustain humans.
1.1.6.1.3.9.1. Pro: If people don't get enough nutrients from their food, they may need to eat more, which in turn uses up more resources.
1.1.6.1.4. Con: Vegans may engage in other behaviours that are harmful to the environment according to the psychological phenomenon known as [moral self-licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-licensing).
1.1.6.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.4.6.
1.1.6.1.4.2. Pro: Because other behaviors \(such as travel\) emit more than becoming vegan, priorities should be placed on these detrimental behaviors first and over the diet \(such as teaching people about not utilizing vehicles to travel before teaching them about becoming vegan\). This change would lead to a greater environmental benefit than everyone just going vegan.
1.1.6.1.4.2.1. Con: Livestock produce 14.5% off all CO2 equivalent greenhouse gasses \([Gerber et al, 2013](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3437e.pdf)\), while all transportation produces 14% of all CO2 equivalent greenhouse gasses \([epa.gov](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data)\). Therefor becoming vegan is just as effective as never transport yourself or any goods that you may use.
1.1.6.1.4.2.2. Con: Greenhouse gas emissions are not the only environmental impact from the animal industries. Producing meat and dairies also requires much more water and land use compared to simply producing crops. All in all, a[huge recent study](https://www.google.se/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth) found that the single best way to reduce ones environmental impact is to go vegan.
1.1.6.1.4.3. Pro: The moral self licensing offsets the environmental benefits of the vegan diet.
1.1.6.1.4.4. Con: Since being vegan is often the result of a general interest in protecting the environment and sentient life-forms from unnecessary harm, vegan lifestyle is often accompanied by other lifestyle decisions that aim to reduce harm done to the environment. Vegans are thus more likely to show a broad spectrum of behaviour that aims to protect the environment.
1.1.6.1.4.4.1. Pro: Being vegan creates a guideline on how to be eco. Thus, if anything is worse, then people are more likely to recognize and do something about it \(like raise awareness\).
1.1.6.1.4.5. Con: Just because vegans "may" engage in other destructive activities does not mean they necessarily will. It certainly does not mean people should not go vegan, since some might perfectly fine transition without falling into moral self-licensing.
1.1.6.1.4.5.1. Pro: Most likely when people go vegan, they will not engage in moral self-licensing, because humans are creatures of habit will stick to the same routine they have except for one change.
1.1.6.1.4.5.2. Con: The major life change from the vegan lifestyle may trigger other life-changing behaviors as well, some of which may be moral self-licensing.
1.1.6.1.4.6. Con: People may engage as much in these behaviors anyway if they are not vegan. If they are vegan, they are providing an overall greater benefit, even when engaging in these activities.
1.1.6.1.4.7. Con: When everyone goes vegan, then new laws may come about to discourage people from engaging in worse activities to prevent climate change from affecting their region \(like a country\) anyway. Thus, this should not be a worry.
1.1.6.1.4.8. Con: If going vegan makes one more prone to moral self-licensing, then transitioning to veganism should be consciously paired with other eco-friendly lifestyle choices, such as avoiding flight and fossile fuel car travel.
1.1.6.1.5. Con: Global over-population is a real problem: people should be allowed to choose a diet that shortens their lifespan.
1.1.6.1.5.1. Con: There are better and more effective ways to reduce world population than by shortening their life, for example through widespread availability of family planning, spreading awareness on the causes and effects of overpopulation, providing easier access to birth control devices and implementing social norms to educate the public.
1.1.6.1.5.2. Con: Many people do not realise that by eating a diet of animal products they are more likely to contract diseases / risk early death as a result.  Since assisted death is often illegal and suicide is always discouraged the argument to “let people choose to live unhealthily and die sooner” seems weak. You would also have to change the ‘official’ guidance on nutrition to ensure people understand the health risks associated with consuming animal products.
1.1.6.1.5.3. Con: The cost to health services would be too great - they are already struggling with funding and lack of resources - unless you refused treatment to anyone not following a vegan diet
1.1.6.1.5.4. Pro: Shorter lifespans in an age of explosive and ever-increasing population growth with people living longer is a really detrimental situation with an inconclusive outcome as to who perishes. At least with shorter lifespans, the population remains stable and we know the outcome of humanity, due to predictability of shorter lifespans.
1.1.6.1.5.5. Pro: Allowing for shorter lifespans allows for control over the fate of humanity, instead of being dictated and ruled by nature.
1.1.6.1.5.6. Pro: With shorter lifespans, the case of "a shorter life is better than no life at all" comes into play. With short lifespans, everyone gets a chance to live, even though it is short. If everyone lives longer, especially on an animal-based diet, then future generations much shorter, if any life at all than if people die at a predictable lifespan and rate.
1.1.6.1.6. Con: Though it may seem that ethical veganism would be beneficial to the environment, a vegan lifestyle for all humans is not sustainable.
1.1.6.1.6.1. Pro: [Food waste](http://veganzinga.com/going-vegan-wont-end-world-hunger/) and a lack of production would still occur, which means that a vegan diet would not sustain the world's population.
1.1.6.1.6.1.1. Pro: Starving people would still not get access \(due to lack of money\) to food they need.
1.1.6.1.6.2. Pro: Although a vegan diet can extend the maximum world population, it still has a cap \(at most adding [4 billion](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034015/meta) more people to the 10-11 billion people cap of an omnivore diet\).
1.1.6.1.6.3. Pro: If most of the population became vegan we would need to use chemical fertilizers instead of raising animals for fertilizer \(manure\). This switch is not a sustainable or eco-friendly option.
1.1.6.1.6.3.1. Pro: This benefits already large and unethical agrochemical companies like [Monsanto](https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=monsanto+unethical+issues).
1.1.6.1.6.3.2. Con: [Manure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_phosphorus) does not sustain civilizations anymore, so phosphorus rock from mining and chemical reactions is the main source of fertilizer now.
1.1.6.1.6.3.3. Con: Meat requires more fertilizer \([50x](http://theconversation.com/how-the-great-phosphorus-shortage-could-leave-us-all-hungry-54432)\) than vegan foods. So vegan diets will actually use less chemical fertilizers than meat, making it the more sustainable choice.
1.1.6.1.6.3.4. Con: If people stop killing animals, due to going vegan, then wildlife could roam fields and provide some of the manure to counter the manure shortage from farm animals.
1.1.6.1.6.3.5. Pro: Chemical fertilizers are not good for the environment, causing ['dead zones'](http://theconversation.com/how-the-great-phosphorus-shortage-could-leave-us-all-hungry-54432) in the ocean.
1.1.6.1.6.3.6. Pro: Chemicals that are mined for fertilizer have a limited quantity \(such as [phosphorus](http://theconversation.com/how-the-great-phosphorus-shortage-could-leave-us-all-hungry-54432), which is highly unsustainable\), and relying on them will eventually lead to food shortages.
1.1.6.1.6.3.6.1. Pro: Manure provides a ['closed loop](http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2016/finalwebsite/problems/phosphorus.html)' of recycling chemicals, like phosphorus, in the ecosystem, whereas mining does not. Manure is sustainable, whereas mining is not.
1.1.6.1.6.3.7. Con: Instead of animals, [human waste](https://www.planetnatural.com/phosphorous-fertilizer/) could be a replacement.
1.1.6.1.6.3.7.1. Pro: Although this is not vegan \(humans are animals\), because this is really eco and sustainable, vegans should make an exception for this to help their crops grow.
1.1.6.1.6.3.8. Con: Technology, like [software](http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2016/finalwebsite/solutions/phosphorus.html), can slow fertilizer use.
1.1.6.1.6.4. Pro: Vegan foods might travel more food miles than meat \([tropical, packaged, fresh, and store bought are the biggest contenders currently](https://cuesa.org/learn/how-far-does-your-food-travel-get-your-plate)\).
1.1.6.1.6.4.1. Con: The majority of food-related greenhouse gas emissions occur during production, with final transport to retail only contributing [4% of the total emissions](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es702969f). Food choices have far more impact on GHG emissions than distance travelled.
1.1.6.1.6.4.1.1. Con: This does not take into account any other polluting factors. Especially in the northern parts of the world, vegetables are not available for long periods of times during the year. A switch off from meat completely would necessitate large scale transportation of food from other areas, which would need new planes, ships, trains etc. Infrastructure would need to be enlarged \(ports, airports etc\). All of this would increase the need for raw building materials, mines are great polluters for example.
1.1.6.1.6.4.2. Pro: According to the [article](https://cuesa.org/learn/how-far-does-your-food-travel-get-your-plate), local food vendors try to be more environmentally friendly in their approaches than ones further out.
1.1.6.1.6.4.3. Pro: Depending on the location, some vegans may have more food miles for their food than if they lived elsewhere [\(like living in Sweden versus the UK\), which could cause their food to have more miles traveled than a meat eater \(such as one living in Iowa\)](http://ngfn.org/resources/ngfn-database/knowledge/food_mil.pdf).
1.1.6.1.6.4.4. Pro: Foods that travel more miles use [more energy \(14% of the food system is transport-related\), and packaging uses even more](https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/viewhtml.php?id=281).
1.1.6.1.6.4.5. Pro: Increase in emissions \(like [CO2](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/09/04/how-green-is-local-food/)\) can come from transportation of heavily exported foods, like quinoa \([1](https://www.pri.org/stories/2010-06-21/quinoa-bolivias-nutty-tasting-export-success), [2](https://foodfirst.org/bolivian-quinoa-to-eat-or-to-export/)\).
1.1.6.1.6.5. Con: We don't have enough resources to allow every person to live on the same diet as the average US or European citizen. We already keep billions of farmed animals \(more than the number of all humans who have ever lived so far\); yet we are not able to provide everyone with enough food. We already use a third of all available land on this planet for animal agriculture. We cannot continue this unless we clear even more rainforests and other natural habitats.
1.1.6.1.6.6. Con: Since everyone becoming vegan is a step forward in a positive, eco direction, we can continue that momentum by working on this theme \(like food waste education, selling 'ugly' produce, growing food...\). However, without going vegan, these steps cannot be made. So even though veganism might not be sustainable, it is the foundation and start for our sustainability.
1.1.6.1.7. Pro: A vegan society would cause the least harm to wildlife.
1.1.6.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.6.1.7.2. Con: Consuming plants, in fact, can sometimes lead to [man - animal conflict](http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/elephants/asian_elephants/areas/issues/elephant_human_conflict/). For instance, the clearing of forests for producing crops in some states of India have led to fragmentation of the habitat for animals like elephants. As a result, when they enter these areas, the crops get destroyed and people tend to burst crackers or use fire to shoo them away. Fragmentation of habitat means no migration which means lack of food and hence loss of life.
1.1.6.1.7.2.1. Con: Raising animals for human use does in fact [require more](https://www.culinaryschools.org/yum/vegetables/) crops and farmland than not using animals.
1.1.6.1.7.3. Con: [Monocrop](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/environmental/monoculture-gardening.htm) agriculture to service vegan demand is an environmental catastrophe.
1.1.6.1.7.3.1. Pro: Vegan foods affect the wildlife of insects, such as [bumblebees and bees](https://www.kialo.com/should-all-bee-products-be-banned-1233/1233.0=1233.1+1233.387).
1.1.6.1.7.3.2. Pro: The least-harm alternatives are mentioned in the [cons here along their children claims](https://www.kialo.com/the-ethics-of-eating-animals-is-eating-meat-wrong-1229/1229.0=1229.1-1229.2000+1229.2117). They include utilizing hydroponics/aeroponics/vertical gardens \(to increase space for wildlife and also avoid conflicts with them\), and hand picking crops instead of using machines.
1.1.6.1.7.3.3. Pro: Pests and diseases could be introduced and spread over non-native parts of the world due to globalization of the food system, where it could cause damage there. The extent of damage goes past lost crops towards infecting wild lands \(impacting [biodiversity](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/1118322/icode/) there\). One example of this is [chestnut blight from Asia wiping out American chestnut trees](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2016/05/12/invasive-pests-no-1-threat-wnc-forests/84189454/).
1.1.6.1.7.3.4. Con: Following a vegan, plant-based diet [causes the least harm to animals](https://freefromharm.org/common-justifications-for-eating-animals/comparing-animal-deaths-production-plant-animal-foods/).
1.1.6.1.7.3.4.1. Con: Many species of wild animals have been almost hunted to extinction by farmers that felt threatened by their presence or the animals eating their crops, causing significant disruptions in natural habitats.
1.1.6.1.7.3.4.2. Pro: Crop fields do indeed disrupt the habitats of wild animals, and wild animals are also killed when harvesting plants. However, this point makes the case for a plant-based diet and not against it, since many [more plants](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/vegans-kill-animals-too) are required to produce a measure of animal flesh for food than are required to produce an equal measure of plants for food. A plant-based diet causes less suffering and death than one that includes animals.
1.1.6.1.7.3.5. Con: The idea of perfect veganism is a non-vegan one. The [actual ethics](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/vegans-kill-animals-too) of veganism are focused on causing the least possible harm to the fewest number of others.
1.1.6.1.7.3.5.1. Con: This is a "[No True Scotsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)" fallacy, creating a washed-out definition of Veganism to avoid the contradictions that it faces off, until it eventually might just as well become "Conscientious Omnivore Diet", defeating the purpose of Veganism itself.
1.1.6.1.7.3.6. Con: The [accidental deaths](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/vegans-kill-animals-too) from growing and harvesting plants are ethically different to the intentional deaths caused by slaughtering animals for food.
1.1.6.1.7.3.6.1. Con: Unfortunately, the outcome is the same for those animals.
1.1.6.1.7.4. Con: Without the cycle of life, [nature dies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q&feature=youtu.be). All life ends in the mouth of another.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1. Pro: Without a top predator to [selectively cull](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/game-handling/selective-culling.htm) the old and sick, entire populations \(species grouping \(like a herd\) or the total population of ecosystems\) might not survive \(due to starvation, etc.\).
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.1. Pro: If Texans didn't cull boars, they would overrun farms and destroy the livelihood of hardworking people.  Boars also kill people.  [A Plague of Pigs in Texas](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-plague-of-pigs-in-texas-73769069/)
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.2. Pro: Selective culling keeps populations healthy and reduces the spread of disease \(including inter-species ones like mad cow disease \([1](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/game-handling/selective-culling1.htm), [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/17/science/17obprey.html)\)\).
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3. Con: Selective culling causes issues too.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.1. Pro: Once the weak are all hunted, people will resort to other forms of hunting \(like trophy hunting\).
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: In trophy hunting, the best-looking animals are hunted \(a.k.a. selected\) for a collection, which could unbalance the natural population \(by cutting out the best and worst, only the middle is left\).
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: This transition can become unethical.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: People can start hunting healthy animals out of desperation \(because all the animals that a weak, old, and ill are hunted out by selective culling and people are still in the habit of hunting\).
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Once people transition, they might like trophy hunting more than selective culling \(especially if they used "selective culling" as an [excuse](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/game-handling/selective-culling.htm) to trophy hunt\). Then they would trophy hunt more than selective culling, which would decrease the positive benefits that selective culling provides.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.2. Pro: One example is that the more people hunt, the more that errors emerge due to recklessness and carelessness. This could damage culled and non-culled populations.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.3. Pro: Sometimes hunters selectively cull on purpose to cultivate [better breeds](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227324276_Selective_culling_of_Iberian_red_deer_stags_Cervus_elaphus_hispanicus_by_selective_monteria_in_Spain) for trophy hunting.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4. Pro: Selective culling does not leave nature alone, but instead [takes the place of natural selection](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/game-handling/selective-culling.htm). [Artificial selection](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227324276_Selective_culling_of_Iberian_red_deer_stags_Cervus_elaphus_hispanicus_by_selective_monteria_in_Spain) has no purpose \(as nature already does selecting\) but contains plenty of negative consequences.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.1. Pro: When this happens, there are negative consequences with no benefit \(just doing an activity with no purpose, like helping someone \(nature\) who already has a job that they can perform without help \(from hunters\)\).
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.2. Pro: People place the value of one species over another \(by supporting the growth of a population through weeding out the weak\), which can disrupt the balance within the ecosystem.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: Then less predatory species can thrive to the point they [overpopulate and cause threats](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140305-culling-badgers-deer-bison-swans-ethics-conservation/) to their own and other species' populations.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Humans may selectively cull species for cultivation rather than environmentalism, which potentially disrupts the ecosystem.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.2.2.1. Pro: If people spend money on their hunting gear \(camo clothing, guns...\), then the opportunity cost is not donating to saving endangered species \(like fighting poaching\). Endangered species suffer in this regard
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.2.3. Pro: The action of placing value of one species over another can negatively impact endangered species.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.2.3.1. Pro: When humans opt to selectively cull they can usurp a natural predator. This competition, with humans, can endanger predating species, as humans remove the predators' main food source \(weak, old, and ill prey\).
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.2.3.2. Pro: People get rid of wildlife they believe are nuisances through culling \(without regards to whether they are endangered or not\). Through this process, they might unintentionally cull endangered species, and harm their population in the process.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.2.3.3. Pro: Even though selective culling may strengthen an endangered species' population by weeding out the bad, people may unknowingly reduce a population to virtual extinction, [numerically and functionally](https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/07/not-yet-gone-but-effectively-extinct/).
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.3. Pro: The negative effects are: promoting hunting, wasting resources \(such as materials to make guns\), and polluting the environment \(like with gun shells\). Thus, the benefits outweigh the risks. Selective culling should not take place.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.4. Con: There are benefits to selective culling, such as improving the ecosystem around a person.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.5. Con: Some people may actually eat the meat from the animals they selectively cull. So while there is no ecological purpose, selective culling has an individualistic one.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.5.1. Con: The bad part about this is that the animal selectively culled may have had a purpose within the ecosystem that they cannot provide when taken out. Possibly, the animal would have been food for a predator or still provided protection to a population, even though it was at a disadvantage.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.6. Pro: Humans might have poor judgment on which animals should thrive within a population or not compared to nature and their assumptions can negatively impact populations.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.6.1. Pro: It is possible that some animals deemed as inferior really are at an advantage that can save the population. One example is that if people were selected for positive traits, then the ones that are [sickle cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease) disease carriers would be selected out. However, this trait protects them from malaria and thus are more advantageous than those without. Thus, removing them weaken's the capabilities of a population to survive.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.6.2. Pro: People might not be aware that removing one animal that is inferior might negatively alter the genetic pool of the population.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.6.2.1. Pro: Decreasing the genetic diversity of a population makes them more susceptible to getting wiped out.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.3.4.6.2.2. Pro: It might be possible that the animal with inferior traits also carry beneficial ones on the same gene, but may not always be obvious, like [obesity and hair color in mice](https://speakingofresearch.com/2012/11/14/bbc-science-club-puts-animal-research-in-the-spotlight/)\). Wiping them out \(called [differential selection](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jwmg.21337)\) may remove unknown/not obvious essential traits crucial to a population's survival and may cause them to suffer or go extinct as a result.
1.1.6.1.7.4.1.4. Con: If everybody went vegan, the practice of forced reproduction would come to an end and the number of animals of species which today are "exploited" by non vegans, which today is artificially pumped up, would be drastically reduced, to a point that the "starvation of the herd" would not be an issue at all. Thus, culling is not necessary.
1.1.6.1.7.4.2. Con: Not all [species' diets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotroph) are based on killing other beings.
1.1.6.1.7.5. Con: The risk of [death of wildlife](https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/viewhtml.php?id=281) increases during the transport of food, especially when the vegan food travels for thousands of miles by land. Local meat would cause less harm to wildlife during its transport.
1.1.6.1.7.5.1. Pro: According to a [scientific study](https://www.treehugger.com/cars/trillions-of-insects-killed-by-cars-every-year-says-study.html), 2 bugs are killed \(by striking the license plate alone\) for every 6.2 miles  driven.  This would equate to 32.5 trillion dead insects in the US alone for a given year.  A utilitarian that believed this argument would likewise argue against cars and other forms of massive insect slaughter.
1.1.6.1.7.5.2. Con: Feed needs to be transported to livestock to eat before their meat is shuttled to the consumer. Vegan food cuts out the middleman \(livestock\) by shuttling the crops directly to the consumer.
1.1.6.1.7.6. Pro: The [fishing industry is especially deleterious to the ocean's biota](http://www.pelagicos.net/MARS6400/readings/Dayton_et_al._1995.pdf).
1.1.6.1.7.6.1. Pro: According to the article, some fish cannot reproduce faster than they are caught \(due to long life stages and low reproduction rates\), leading to a decline in their population.
1.1.6.1.7.6.2. Pro: Trawling and bycatch severely reduces fish \(especially demersal, or bottom-feeding fish\) populations, which negatively affect fisheries.
1.1.6.1.7.6.3. Pro: Modern shrimp trawling operations generates more oceanic waste due to high levels of discards/bycatch in its processes.
1.1.6.1.7.7. Pro: In addition to being not harmful, vegan foods can be very symbiotic with and beneficial to wildlife.
1.1.6.1.7.7.1. Pro: Some foods that are eaten rely on animals to distribute the plant to allow it to flourish elsewhere, such as [elephant bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portulacaria_afra). So eating the plant helps the plant out too.
1.1.6.1.7.7.2. Pro: Allowing vegan foods to grow allows wildlife to grow it. When the plants flower, it helps native insects have food to support their populations.
1.1.6.1.7.7.3. Pro: Fruitarian diets help native plants out \(where food is taken from the plant without harming the plant itself\).
1.1.6.1.7.7.4. Con: Beekeeping is [beneficial to the environment](http://science.time.com/2013/09/12/honeybees-are-still-hurting-but-backyard-and-rooftop-beekeepers-can-help/), yet honey is not vegan. Bee populations [are declining globally](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/beekeeping/9790465/Why-natural-beekeeping-could-save-our-honey-making-friends.html).
1.1.6.1.7.7.4.1. Con: Beekeeping could be inherent to the farming of plants without having to steal the honey and making starve the bees with a glucosic substitute.
1.1.6.1.7.7.4.2. Con: The most commonly kept honeybee \(apis mellifera\) [evolved in Europe](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/full/42463639/1#sectionRange) and are a [non-native species](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198217/) in many areas where they are kept as pollinators and honey producers.
1.1.6.1.7.7.4.3. Con: Honeybees compete with native bee species for pollen and nectar, thus putting pressure on native populations of bees in places where honeybee hives are kept.
1.1.6.1.7.7.4.4. Con: Using honeybees as pollinators [results from](https://www.lexiconoffood.com/video/bees-and-monoculture) \(and reinforces\) large scale monocultural crop plantations which are [harmful to honeybees](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/honey-bees-and-monoculture-nothing-to-dance-about/) and [to the environment](https://theconversation.com/single-crop-farming-is-leaving-wildlife-with-no-room-to-turn-38991).
1.1.6.1.7.8. Pro: People would less likely and less unknowingly eat illegal "[bushmeat](https://www.fws.gov/international/wildlife-without-borders/global-program/bushmeat.html)" \(which is wildlife\).
1.1.6.1.7.8.1. Pro: Even though laws and enforcement \(like in the [US](http://www.newsweek.com/2014/08/29/smuggled-bushmeat-ebolas-back-door-america-265668.html) and [Europe](https://news.mongabay.com/2017/03/endangered-species-to-declare-europes-understudied-bushmeat-trade/)\) try to keep out this type of meat, it still works its way into the food system there. People might eat it thinking they are eating something approved of \(that would be "ethical"\), but in reality are not.
1.1.6.1.7.8.2. Pro: Not only is this bad for the animals, but the diseases that travel with the meat cause [epidemiological](https://qz.com/795294/will-illegal-bushmeat-bring-the-next-global-outbreak/) issues as well. People could get ill with diseases that are rare in their part of the world, which make them more difficult to treat.
1.1.6.1.7.9. Pro: Infrastructure could be made more vegan. Efforts made by the [Boring Company](https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/) to make car traffic go underground could reduce injuries to wildlife on Earth's surface.
1.1.6.1.7.9.1. Pro: The wildlife could be affected by cars coming from suburban areas to cities or within the cities themselves.
1.1.6.1.7.9.2. Pro: As cities start growing their population and people encroach on nature, this issue will become more of a reality than now.
1.1.6.1.7.9.3. Pro: Vehicles reportedly hit [1-2 million animals](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/roadkill-endangers-endangered-wildlife/) a year.
1.1.6.1.7.9.3.1. Con: Most of these accidents take place outside of cities where animals tend to live. In a study of multiple US states, [more than 95%](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/humanfac/94156.cfm) of all wildlife crashes took place on rural roads.
1.1.6.1.7.9.3.2. Pro: Comparing [population](http://images.slideplayer.com/35/10395779/slides/slide_9.jpg) to [roadkill](https://www.vox.com/2015/4/4/8341263/roadkill-maps) on a map, the trend shows that roadkill overlaps with densely populated areas \(a.k.a. cities\)
1.1.6.1.7.9.4. Pro: Global warming is bringing [more animals to cities](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-12/why-wild-animals-are-moving-cities-and-what-do-about-it), making it more important than ever to protect them there.
1.1.6.1.7.9.5. Pro: Removing roads could condense cities to provide more space for wildlife.
1.1.6.1.7.9.5.1. Pro: Then wildlife would have less need to go to cities due to more roaming space
1.1.6.1.7.9.6. Con: There isn't a lot of wildlife in most cities.
1.1.6.1.7.9.6.1. Pro: [Certain species of wildlife is increasing in urban areas](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/20/urban-beasts-how-wild-animals-have-moved-into-cities). Cities create an unbalance of species, leading the food chain to fall apart. That process makes it possible for some species to overgrow and others to falter
1.1.6.1.7.10. Con: Hunting for population control is better for the ecosystem and creates more protections for such species and populations than the vegan approach of not harming animals.
1.1.6.1.7.10.1. Pro: Hunting is a viable method to control overpopulation and invasive animals. This is more environmentally sustainable and ethical for wildlife than not interfering with their population status.
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.1. Pro: Keeping species' populations in check decreases the risk of them going extinct.
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.2. Con: There are methods that vegans can take care of overpopulation and invasions without killing animals, as these problems do not always occur due to natural events.
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.2.1. Pro: Fish kills, which are caused by [overpopulation](https://www.sancoind.com/news/fish-stocking-and-overpopulation) \(too many fish breathing dissolved oxygen\), are also caused by human activities \(like [driving, eating meat, and growing crops](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/qa-chemical-fishkills.html)\). If vegans drive less or do not grow crops near waterways, then they can prevent fish kills without hunting.
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.2.2. Pro: Vegans can try to decrease the capability of a population from getting to big by removing environmental factors that allow them to survive \(like food sources or habitats\).
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.2.3. Pro: Vegans can relocate animals through careful monitoring programs to prevent animal populations from expanding too much.
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.2.4. Pro: Vegans can try to support existing wildlife and make their conditions favorable, so that they can overcome any species with the potential to cause overpopulation or invasions.
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.3. Pro: If there are massive [die-offs](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/die-off), then the animals' meat would go to waste.
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.3.1. Pro: This also saves resources, because farmers would not have to grow crops to feed people if people just eat the animals from die-offs instead.
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.4. Con: Not being vegan is one of the major reasons why the environment has overpopulation and invasive animals to begin with.
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.4.1. Pro: If people do not own pets, then they would not release them into the wild and cause them to become invasive \(like [lionfish](https://www.sailorsforthesea.org/programs/ocean-watch/lionfish-invasion)\).
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.4.2. Pro: Using animals for pest management \(like [ferrets to remove rabbits](https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/pests-and-threats/animal-pests/ferrets/)\) can make them become invasive.
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.4.3. Pro: The desire for hunting caused overpopulation for game animals, like deer \([1](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1276&context=icwdm_usdanwrc), [2](https://www.greenwichtime.com/local/article/Hunting-has-increased-deer-population-not-643259.php)\), through regulated hunting practices and disrupt native species \(like [songbirds](https://blog.nature.org/science/2013/08/22/too-many-deer/) with deer increases\)
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.4.4. Pro: [Fish stocking](https://www.sancoind.com/news/fish-stocking-and-overpopulation) for fishing can cause overpopulation of species as well \(although they may not affect nearby environments if the water body is artificial\).
1.1.6.1.7.10.1.5. Pro: Not interacting with wildlife does not mean we will be helping it. In Oregon, when driving across the Santiam Pass, you'll see forests of dead trees that burnt in a forest fire. People thought if we left it, it would grow back. This was not the case, and now there is a forest of dead trees. \(The trees burnt in a forest fire.\)
1.1.6.1.7.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.7.4.1.
1.1.6.1.7.10.3. Con: There could be other ways to control animal population than killing them.
1.1.6.1.7.10.3.1. Pro: [Vector control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_control) uses [biological](http://www.placermosquito.org/programs/biological-and-physical-control/), [cultural](http://pods.dasnr.okstate.edu/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-8893/L-429.pdf), [physical/mechanical](http://www.placermosquito.org/programs/biological-and-physical-control/), and [legislative](http://www.mvcac.org/advocacy-and-legislation/legislative-and-regulatory-issues/) methods to prevent wildlife from becoming a threat. These methods can assist vegans in handling wildlife through either indirectly or not killing them.
1.1.6.1.7.10.3.2. Pro: PETA has a list of human pest control methods \([1](https://www.peta.org/living/humane-home/humane-bug-prevention/), [2](https://www.peta.org/living/humane-home/insects-may-bug-us/)\)
1.1.6.1.7.10.3.3. Pro: Citizen science-based monitoring projects \(through [mobile apps](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/8-apps-that-turn-citizens-into-scientists/)\) is a great way for vegans to [surveil \(like mapping\)](https://www.rentokil-pestcontrolindia.com/vector-control/mosquito-vector-control-methods/) populations and [respond](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2018/testimony/Info_Testimony_AEN-WTL-EEP-AGR-WAL_01-24-18_VCB.pdf) to issues before they become a large threat.
1.1.6.1.7.10.3.4. Pro: Vegans can do [research](http://www.mvcac.org/advocacy-and-legislation/legislative-and-regulatory-issues/) and brainstorm new methods to handle wildlife once everyone goes vegan.
1.1.6.1.7.10.3.5. Pro: Public education can help to encourage everyone \(especially once vegan\) can take part in the preventative actions for wildlife control.
1.1.6.1.7.10.3.6. Pro: Technology can help to control animal population ethically.
1.1.6.1.7.10.3.6.1. Pro: New technologies, like [drones](http://www.mvcac.org/advocacy-and-legislation/legislative-and-regulatory-issues/), can provide surveillance instead of people being in wildlife areas.
1.1.6.1.7.10.3.6.1.1. Pro: People would not be possibly create damage while they walk in delicate ecosystems with endangered species.
1.1.6.1.7.10.3.6.1.2. Pro: People would be at less risk of being attacked by wildlife. Drones are a safer surveillance option for humans than previous methods of monitoring \(like going in-person to locations\).
1.1.6.1.7.10.3.6.2. Pro: [Genetic engineering \(GE\)](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/06/16/482279851/are-genetically-engineered-mice-the-answer-to-combating-lyme-disease) of mice and deer may help with preventing the spread of Lyme disease instead of [killing them](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/science/ticks-lyme-disease-mice-nantucket.html).
1.1.6.1.7.10.4. Pro: Hunting is more eco-friendly than growing crops, as it uses less resources \(land, water, nutrients...\).
1.1.6.1.7.11. Con: Vegan food can cause more harm to wildlife than save. If people eat [lake-grown algae](http://www.klamathafa.com/afa.html) for example, they are eating more lives in one bite than how many are lost to make a steak.
1.1.6.1.7.12. Pro: Pets \(like [cats](http://www.thegardenisland.com/2018/03/18/hawaii-news/feral-cats-make-invasive-species-list/) and [fish](http://www.saltwatersmarts.com/why-never-release-marine-aquarium-livestock-into-wild-2792/)\) can cause damage to the environment \(especially wildlife\) by becoming invasive. Not having them would decrease this issue.
1.1.6.1.7.13. Con: Vegans are no better than omnivores at competing with other wild animals for the same food source \(birds go after apples and wolves go after sheep\). Thus, vegans are not better off, but create the same harm to wildlife as before from this standpoint.
1.1.6.1.8. Pro: Vegan lifestyles add beauty and removes destruction from the environment.
1.1.6.1.8.1. Pro: Plants that are grown add colors that people make wallpapers out of and are a point of pride for an area: such as the[lavender fields of the French Provence](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pqaNZRauoRU/UeoNq_K9jFI/AAAAAAAABVM/LqTxNcd18x4/s1600/Lavender+fields+Provence+-+France+%284%29.jpg).
1.1.6.1.8.1.1. Pro: Much easier than creating wallpaper featuring a [factory farm](https://www.naturalblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/factory-farms.jpg).
1.1.6.1.8.2. Pro: Vegan lifestyles allow for more freedom, as people most likely feel better after going to a farm and learning about what plants look like to pull crops rather than walking around a dairy or factory farm.
1.1.6.1.8.2.1. Con: There is no all too visible difference between vegan and non-vegan landscapes, as many animal farms are built in rural areas and most of the land there is employed to grow plant crops, produced in particular to accommodate the animal's food demands.
1.1.6.1.8.2.2. Con: Livestock grazing on the free fields is described as a [pastoral landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoral) and was highly regarded aesthetically for millennia. Visual benefits of vegan landscapes over non-vegan ones are thus highly questionable.
1.1.6.1.8.2.3. Con: Visiting certain kinds of fields at certain periods of work cycle may be [dangerous for the health](https://theheartysoul.com/mcdonalds-fries-pesticides/).
1.1.6.1.8.2.4. Con: People may go to the fields with freely grazing animals and feel good after learning about the animal's way of life.
1.1.6.1.8.2.5. Pro: Many people do not know what a plant looks like when it's grown and before/while it produces food. To see that at a farm is an educational experience, especially when comparing different plants to each other to see patterns.
1.1.6.1.8.3. Con: Deforestation for growing crops is not a pretty sight.
1.1.6.1.8.4. Pro: Some vegan foods \(especially trees such as [maple syrup](https://www.massmaple.org/about-maple-syrup/how-sugar-maple-trees-work/) and fruit\) allow the native environment to be preserved while benefiting the plant that the food is taken from.
1.1.6.1.8.4.1. Pro: Tapping maple trees when the sap is flowing down to match air pressure alleviates the trees from too much pressure \(that reaches [40psi](https://www.berkshiresweetgold.com/science--heritage.html)\).
1.1.6.1.8.4.2. Pro: The damage to maple trees is minimal and could be just as much as a [woodpecker's hole](http://www.caryinstitute.org/newsroom/learn-about-science-maple-syrup) \(especially if the spout's placed in one\).
1.1.6.1.8.5. Con: Hunting \(which is not vegan\) is often done to preserve nature, or to finance preserving nature.
1.1.6.1.8.5.1. Con: Hunting is a very ugly sport involving the death of animals in nature \(which leads to extinctions\) and manipulating nature to accommodate hunters and by the act of hunting alone.
1.1.6.1.8.5.2. Pro: Hunting, if done ethically, will give an animal a far quicker and cleaner death than in nature. Old animals often freeze, starve, or get brutally killed by predators.
1.1.6.1.8.5.2.1. Pro: Hunting makes an animal's death more peaceful and humane.
1.1.6.1.8.5.3. Con: Hunting messes up nature's circle of life. When animals die naturally, they provide food for an entire ecosystem at times \(depending on how large the animal is\).
1.1.6.1.8.5.3.1. Con: The fact that an animal that dies in the wild feeds many other animals, plants, etc. doesn't make its death any less painful.
1.1.6.1.8.5.3.1.1. Con: These animals die after having a long and fulfilling life naturally and when it is time to \(instead of being killed through hunting before the animals' life's maximum length is reached\).
1.1.6.1.8.5.3.1.2. Pro: Many animals die in the wild under cruel circumstances, such as disease and injury. For instance, they can die very young, and often without even leaving any \(living\) offspring.
1.1.6.1.8.5.3.2. Pro: Humans manipulated life to the point that they disrupt the natural circle of life. Many humans are not really part of the circle of life anymore.
1.1.6.1.8.5.3.2.1. Pro: Humans have a double standard where they do not want to be hunted \(as die peacefully\) but do not allow the same respect for animals to die a natural death.
1.1.6.1.8.5.3.2.2. Pro: Human remains do not become part of the environment these days with [modern burial practices](http://www.businessinsider.com/burying-dead-bodies-environment-funeral-conservation-2015-10?op=1&r=UK&IR=T#eco-friendly-alternatives-do-exist-6) \(intended to preserve the human body after death instead of decompose, especially with embalming, like Egyptian mummies\).
1.1.6.1.8.5.3.3. Pro: Human-style hunting gives humans an unfair advantage that breaks the circle of life. Humans can potentially kill all life, as seen with overfishing. Any other animal on Earth is not capable of this.
1.1.6.1.8.5.4. Pro: Hunting is part of the circle of life. Animals hunt and use tools for it. Humans are animals and just made this form of hunting more advanced \(through better tools like guns\).
1.1.6.1.8.5.4.1. Pro: The better tools makes humans higher in the food chain \(just like how animals who use tools allow them to be higher in the food chain\).
1.1.6.1.8.5.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.8.5.3.3.
1.1.6.1.9. Pro: [Land use is lowest with a vegan diet](https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.12952/journal.elementa.000116/elementa.000116.f002.png/). We could decrease the amount of land we need for food production drastically; allowing for more areas to be taken over by nature, increasing biodiversity in the long run.
1.1.6.1.9.1. Con: The land use argument is assuming that humans can just survive by eating grains. If someone would try, he would die very soon because essential nutrients are missing. In reality a vegan diet is relying on an extreme variety of low quality food. Vegetables and fruits have low nutritional value but use huge amount of land.
1.1.6.1.10. Pro: One [study](http://tier-im-fokus.ch/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/baroni07.pdf) revealed that the vegan diet has the lowest total environmental impact compared to Italian, omnivore, and vegetarian diets, especially when organically grown.
1.1.6.1.11. Con: Eating/drinking less or not at all is much better \(environmentally, ethically, socially...\) than a vegan diet.
1.1.6.1.11.1. Pro: There are a few tricks to get in this direction of eating less right now before better technologies come along \(like a [food replacement pill](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a8787/why-dont-we-have-food-replacement-pills-15248871/)\).
1.1.6.1.11.1.1. Pro: People who weigh less require a lower caloric intake to maintain their body weight than those who weigh more.
1.1.6.1.11.1.2. Pro: Getting ill and injured less often will allow the body to not need as much resources to recover from those events.
1.1.6.1.11.1.3. Pro: Sedentary lifestyles require less calories than high level activity ones.
1.1.6.1.11.1.4. Pro: Nutrient-rich foods allow people to be full and get adequate nutrition from lower food quantities.
1.1.6.1.11.1.5. Pro: Humans could live for some periods without eating, due to [autophagy](https://www.dietdoctor.com/renew-body-fasting-autophagy) \(although what is lost would need to be replaced if autophagy goes too far and is detrimental to health\).
1.1.6.1.11.2. Pro: Maybe people could be genetically be designed to be autotrophs instead of heterotrophs. Then getting food from only sunlight and water would be possible \(compared to now\).
1.1.6.1.11.2.1. Pro: Maybe the genetic design could be based on [these animals](http://www.viralnova.com/animals-dont-eat/).
1.1.6.1.11.2.2. Pro: With genetic editing, the genes that code for synthesizing vitamins that are only possible in other animals, such as [Vitamin C](https://blog.livonlabs.com/goat-vitamin-c-production/), could be placed in humans to make them closer to autotrophic than before.
1.1.6.1.11.3. Pro: If people are in suspended animation \(such as for long voyages in space\), then people might survive on little caloric intake.
1.1.6.1.11.4. Con: This is not a realistic possibility for humans, as biologically we need food to survive.
1.1.6.1.11.4.1. Con: As of now, no, but maybe one day in the future it might become a reality.
1.1.6.1.11.5. Con: There are no hypothetical studies to show that not eating would be best for our physical health and well-being.
1.1.6.1.11.6. Pro: The main reason is that agriculture contributes to global warming and depletes natural resources.
1.1.6.1.11.6.1. Con: Maybe we do not need to eat less, but instead make sure our food comes takes little resources. In [Finland](https://futurism.com/a-team-of-scientists-just-made-food-from-electricity-and-it-could-be-the-solution-to-world-hunger/), food is grown using electricity \(from renewable sources\), water, carbon dioxide, and microbes. This is a lot better than most crop and meat production currently.
1.1.6.1.11.7. Pro: If people's minds get digitally uploaded and then downloaded into robotic bodies, then people's food supply could be [electricity instead of food](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g).
1.1.6.1.12. Con: The production of vegetables, fruits and nuts uses huge amount of land for basically no nutritional value.
1.1.6.1.13. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.10.
1.1.6.1.14. Con: This is an over simplification and [studies show](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/18/being-a-vegetarian-might-make-you-feel-environmentally-superior-why-that-may-be-wrong/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.baa07232a344) that this is not an accepted scientific fact.  Switching to a diet with less or no meat \(of certain types\) has no guarantee of environmental benefits, and depending on particulars of the diet may in fact cause more environmental harm.
1.1.6.1.14.1. Pro: Properly managed animal farming can have huge benefits to biodiversity.
1.1.6.1.14.1.1. Con: Quite the opposite. As a matter of fact, industrial farming is a [major cause](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/08/meat-eaters-may-speed-worldwide-species-extinction-study-warns) of loss of biodiversity.
1.1.6.1.14.1.2. Con: The vast majority of animal agriculture at the moment is not properly managed.
1.1.6.1.14.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.2.7.1.
1.1.6.1.14.2. Con: A [systematic review](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165797) found that a vegan diet tended to be better for the environment \(tables 2, 3, and 4\). The majority of evidence points to a vegan diet being good for the environment.
1.1.6.1.14.3. Pro: Shifting to the diets recommended the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans \(less red meat and poultry; more seafood/fish, fruits, vegetables, and dairy\) would increase energy use by 38%, water use by 10%, and greenhouse gas emissions by 6% according to researchers at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284712516_Energy_use_blue_water_footprint_and_greenhouse_gas_emissions_for_current_food_consumption_patterns_and_dietary_recommendations_in_the_US).
1.1.6.1.14.3.1. Con: The article mentions a study of vegetarianism, where they actually include fish \(so it's in fact pescetarianism\), not veganism.
1.1.6.1.14.3.2. Con: The article builds up on an unreliably small and divergent sample of data - as stated by the article itself - and is thus not able to make a conclusive statement regarding veganism applied on the entire human population.
1.1.6.1.14.3.3. Con: The evidence provided discusses a vegetarian diet, one which includes the consumption of dairy products and fish as well as fruits and vegetables. As such, this piece of research is irrelevant to this conversation.
1.1.6.1.14.3.4. Con: The actual content on this article is actually that research results vary greatly and are not easy to interpret.
1.1.6.1.14.3.4.1. Con: The research is scientifically conclusive, however. Variety is comprehended in the study because it is expected.
1.1.6.1.14.3.5. Con: The authors published a [letter](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10669-016-9585-6) stressing that this analysis "did not compare vegetarian to non-vegetarian diets". In addition, the authors recommended [several](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/vegetarian-bad-for-environment-debunked_us_567072d7e4b0e292150f95a4) [media](https://news.vice.com/article/no-bacon-isnt-better-for-the-environment-than-lettuce) [articles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/18/being-a-vegetarian-might-make-you-feel-environmentally-superior-why-that-may-be-wrong/?noredirect=on) which more accurately reflect their research.
1.1.6.1.14.3.6. Con: These conclusions were based on an overall increase in animal products.

"Although this scenario modeled a 33 percent decrease in meat consumption \(beef, pork, and poultry\), it also modeled a 78 percent increase in dairy consumption and a tripling in seafood consumption—leading to an overall 13 percent increase in animal‐based food consumption \(as measured by calories\)"
[www.wri.org](http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/uploads/Memo_on_CMU_study.pdf)
1.1.6.1.14.4. Pro: Pasture animals can [improve](https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2011/grazing-of-cattle-pastures-can-improve-soil-quality/) soil [degradation](https://onpasture.com/2018/01/22/grazing-your-cover-crops-can-build-good-soil/).
1.1.6.1.14.4.1. Con: Reversing the effects of soil degradation could be achieved through vegan means, such as biochar, no-till farming, and crop rotation.
1.1.6.1.14.4.2. Con: [Overgrazing](http://people.oregonstate.edu/~muirp/wpubland.htm) could create soil degradation as well as a host of other environmental issues.
1.1.6.1.14.4.3. Pro: Soil degradation from crop production can [prevent grazing](http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/y8344e/y8344e0j.htm) from even being possible.
1.1.7. Con: It is acceptable to limit the freedom when the freedom infringes on the rights of others. By the same notion, you would not be allowed to eat another person, as that limits their right to exist.
1.1.7.1. Con: Animals do not share human rights.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Rights are artificial constructs created to order our behavior. Nonhumans may not have "human rights," but that should not stop them from having "animal rights." Neither is less artificial than the other, but that does not mean they would not both serve important moral purposes.
1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Giving animals just animal rights allows human rights to not be degraded to those of animals or vice versa \(where human rights apply to animals, but cause harm to them instead of protection\).
1.1.7.1.1.2. Con: Giving animals just animal rights may make animals more susceptible to laws to reduce their rights, while humans are not affected. Animals need extra protection right now, if giving animals human rights serve them better, then extending those rights to them has merit.
1.1.7.1.2. Con: This does not mean they shouldn't have the right to be needlessly exploited.
1.1.7.1.3. Con: In the past humans have failed to grant other groups of humans rights, we may be as wrong now about not granting rights to animals as we were then.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Violence and non-violence / invasiveness and non-invasiveness are never morally equivalent choices, no matter the topic.
1.1.7.3. Pro: Individual freedom should be limited by the suffering of other sentient beings.
1.1.7.3.1. Con: Animals are not moral actors and as such their abuse, exploitation and life are not subject to a question of morals.
1.1.7.3.1.1. Pro: To be a moral actor one must be capable of making moral decisions.  Animals do not have this ability.
1.1.7.3.1.2. Pro: Plants are identical to animals in their inability to make moral decisions, yet humans must eat to survive.
1.1.7.3.1.3. Con: Entities do not need to be moral actors to be included in the moral calculus of other entities. For example [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is concerned with suffering, irrespective of the moral ability of those that suffer.
1.1.7.3.1.3.1. Con: This form of utilitarianism equates animal suffering with human suffering.  This will lead to a society that minimizes the total aggregate suffering of animals and people.  Seeing as this argument is about what people should do, this is not germane.
1.1.7.3.1.3.2. Con: Utilitarianism is not the only school of philosophical thought.  For example here is a [list.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_philosophies)
1.1.7.3.1.3.3. Con: Utilitarianism does not concern itself with motives only outcomes and as such the "[moral luck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_luck)" problem is one that it can't escape.
1.1.7.3.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.7.5.1.
1.1.7.3.2. Pro: People do not need animal products either and it's improper to speak about individual freedom when there are sentient victims.
1.1.7.3.3. Con: There is [research](https://science.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/plants-feel-pain.htm) to suggest that plants too can feel pain.
1.1.7.3.3.1. Con: Plants neither feel pain, nor any emotions, that is not how they have been naturally selected to evolve.
1.1.7.3.3.1.1. Pro: They have neither [nervous system nor pain receptors](https://www.vice.com/sv/article/xd74nd/we-asked-a-botanist-how-sure-science-is-that-plants-cant-feel-pain-302). Plus, although plants have neurotransmitters \(even the same as ones found in [humans](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/acetylcholine)\), they do not use it for thinking but instead as [protection](https://phys.org/news/2014-02-human-brain-humans-insects.html) \(by changing their predators' brain chemistry to prevent their attacks\).
1.1.7.3.3.1.2. Pro: Fruits, for example, are deliberately tasty, so that other organisms consume them and thereby involuntarily distribute the fruits' seeds, as they are not digested, or left on the floor.
1.1.7.3.3.2. Pro: To not eat meat or any other animal product for the reason of an evolutionary adaptation \(pain\) while still eating plants whom have also shown the "will" to survive through many adaptations \(poison,...\), because of the ease to empathise with one but not with the other is merely a form of tribalism. Not a virtue.
1.1.7.4. Pro: Humans shouldn't have the right to choose the life and death of others if they do not depend on doing so for survival.
1.1.7.4.1. Con: Saying we don't need to do something is not a compelling reason why we should not do it.  There are many unnecessary things that people do every day, and most likely should, unless one would like humankind to return to subsistence living.
1.1.7.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.1.7.4.3. Con: Plants are alive too.
1.1.7.4.4. Con: Currently not all people abide by the rule a diet must be vegan.  This claim is self defeating.
1.1.7.5. Pro: Living beings are not comparable to simple "food items" as this is not a matter of taste, but a choice of life or death.
1.1.8. Pro: As the only more or less commonly agreed benefit of veganism is morality, and even this is [not undisputed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/pop-psych/201311/curious-case-vegan-moral-hypocrisy), the claim that all humans should become vegan as justified as that all people are to follow a single religious teaching.
1.1.9. Pro: Freedom of choice is framed in particular circumstances, such as a capitalist society in which you can choose among what you can pay, or a deprivided society with little options. Under some particular circumstances and through a rationalization process, one may conclude that [it may be beneficial to Humanity to become Vegan.](https://www.sciencealert.com/what-if-the-whole-world-suddenly-went-vegetarian)
1.1.10. Pro: Since coercion is not justified there is no way to make all humans stop eating meat.
1.1.11. Pro: Humans would not be able to interact with nature in a fulfilling and exciting way, which would make society worse off overall.
1.1.11.1. Con: The notion that a fulfilling and/or exciting way to interact with nature must imply restraining, exploiting or killing animals is unfounded. There is no reason to think \(and certainly there is no evidence\) that vegans, on average, interact with nature in a less fulfilling and/or exciting way compared to non vegans.
1.1.11.1.1. Pro: There are many possibilites of interacting with or learning about nature that do not require killing or exploiting animals - like going visiting wildlife parks, hiking / mountain climbing, photography, visting museums, watching nature documentaries, working at animal shelters.
1.1.11.2. Pro: Hunting and fishing are examples of interacting with nature in a fulfilling and exciting way.
1.1.11.2.1. Con: It's unnecessary killing of animals.
1.1.11.2.2. Con: Hunting could still be allowed under more restrictive circumstances \(e.g. where population control is actually needed\).
1.1.11.2.3. Con: Virtual hunting and fishing could be a sufficient replacement.
1.1.11.2.3.1. Con: There is something uniquely satisfying about killing an animal for food and eating it that is lost when hunting or fishing virtually.
1.1.11.2.3.1.1. Con: Killing an animal and eating it is not necessary for a happy life.
1.1.11.3. Pro: If people never ate meat, they would be deprived of a fulfilling experience.
1.1.11.3.1. Con: Often, people don't know about many other foods and are therefore deprived of a fulfilling experience.
1.1.11.3.2. Con: Choosing to remain abstinent from something that is \(potentially\) harmful is not the same as deprivation.
1.1.11.3.3. Con: If someone never ate meat, they wouldn't miss it.
1.1.11.3.3.1. Pro: Refraining from an activity because you recognize its harmful impact is not the same as "missing out". Some people choose to never drink or smoke because of that reason.
1.1.11.3.3.2. Pro: Meat does not necessarily taste good. People would not be fulfilled from eating it if they never have before. They also benefit from being deprived of a negative \(potentially traumatizing\) situation.
1.1.11.3.3.2.1. Pro: Many children will remember being coaxed or forced to eat certain things even if they didn't like them, including some meats and meat products, causing them to dislike the taste.
1.1.11.3.3.2.2. Con: Many people are conditioned to like the taste of meat, so many people like it. This conditioning is difficult to change.
1.1.11.3.3.2.2.1. Con: This does not count or mean we should eat meat, as people can be conditioned to like the taste of vegan foods as well.
1.1.11.3.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: A few generations ago, people were conditioned to be skeptical of homosexuality and still we have legalized gay marriage today. It is possible to change social conditioning.
1.1.11.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: People might get angry if something they are used to for long and is ingrained into their lives so well suddenly gets taken away from them.
1.1.11.3.3.2.2.2.1. Con: Meat would not be taken away overnight.
1.1.11.3.3.2.3. Pro: Getting everyone vegan will allow the many people who do not like the taste of meat to enjoy the great taste of vegan foods.
1.1.11.3.3.2.3.1. Con: We should not transition to vegan foods if they do not taste better than meat \(as some vegan foods taste worse than meat\).
1.1.11.3.3.2.3.1.1. Con: This a false equivalency. You do not have to replace steak by a perfect vegan copy, you can find meals that you like just as much and that happen to be vegan.
1.1.11.3.3.2.4. Pro: Taste is subjective.
1.1.11.3.3.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.4.1.3.
1.1.11.3.3.2.4.2. Pro: Many vegans do not experience cravings for animal products after some months / years of being vegan.
1.1.11.3.3.2.5. Pro: It's the spices, i.e. plants, and thermic processing make meat taste good. Raw meat is inedible for most.
1.1.11.3.3.2.6. Pro: Many people dislike the taste of meat, eggs, milk or cheese. It's subjective.
1.1.11.3.3.2.7. Con: Meat's taste is not a valid argument because vegetables also taste bad. Yet, nobody tries to ban them
1.1.12. Pro: A vegan society would restrict people's individual liberties, which would make society worse off overall.
1.1.12.1. Con: Nobody in any society can eat what he/she wants, so nobody has completely free individual liberties. A\) Some consumables are illegal B\) Some consumables are toxic or dangerous C\) we are already restricted in our consumption because we can't digest many things.
1.1.12.2. Con: Individuals don't have the liberty to own slaves, rape, kill others, defecate in public transport, drive while under influence, etc. Does that make the society worse off? Societies are not worse off when they restrict what people can do to other conscious beings.
1.1.12.3. Con: It's inappropriate to speak of personal choice or exercise of individual freedom when there are [victims](http://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/eating-meat-is-personal-choice).
1.1.12.4. Pro: People should not be forced into being vegan, because then it would block their freedom to think independently.
1.1.12.4.1. Pro: This is unethical, because it limits people's autonomy and capability of pursuing life, liberty, and happiness.
1.1.12.4.2. Pro: When people cannot think independently, then they are more dependent on whomever thinks for them \(in this case, the government\). Thus, the world being vegan would turn countries into [nanny states](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/nanny+state), so citizens become more reliant on the government for decisions.
1.1.12.4.2.1. Pro: The movement countries towards nanny states could set its citizens up for failure. When the government stops being there for its people, then people will not be able to take care of themselves anymore \(because their thought capabilities were taken away\), which limits their capability of surviving in the world.
1.1.12.4.3. Con: Veganism doesn't limit freedom of thought, but rather limits actions, similar to laws against violence.
1.1.12.4.3.1. Con: This would be the exact reason why worldwide veganism might not work though, because people will choose not to participate in it \(i.e. rebel\), as their thought does not have limits of freedom.
1.1.12.5. Con: If we restricted animal product consumption, the amount of damage a human can do to the environment would also be reduced, which in turn benefits the whole human population since climate change and pollution affect us all. Restricting an individual liberty for the protection of humanity would not make society worse off.
1.1.12.6. Pro: A government should not have the ability to enforce changes in our current habits, as it is a massive invasion into personal/everyday lives and privacy. This is not something that exists in current day, but could be inevitable in a vegan world. That is why we should not should not make the world vegan.
1.1.12.7. Pro: Killing some animals for food is an example of a human liberty.
1.1.12.7.1. Con: Liberty ends where needless suffering begins.
1.1.12.7.2. Con: Vegans want non-vegans to want to, of their own volition, become vegan.
1.1.12.7.2.1. Con: Some vegans want to restrict human rights from killing animals.
1.1.12.7.2.1.1. Con: This is not a [mainstream view](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) of veganism.
1.1.13. Pro: Many people gain substantial happiness from their non-vegan diet.
1.1.13.1. Pro: The demand for meat [increases](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-and-seafood-production-consumption). This shows its popularity.
1.1.13.1.1. Con: This could be tied to the [subsidization](https://meatonomics.com/2013/08/22/meatonomics-index/) of meat products, resulting in them being cheaper than plant based food, not necessarily to their popularity.
1.1.13.1.2. Con: The demand of meat increases because 3rd world countries follow the most developed ones which don't necessarily show the right example. Doing so they mimic the practices, which we can clearly see are usually [reversing](https://ensia.com/articles/these-maps-show-changes-in-global-meat-consumption-by-2024-heres-why-that-matters/) in the 1st world countries. Tendencies reverse because obvious reasons have been claimed and confirmed with scientific data and moral basis that explain and inform people on verifiable facts that will make them decide and hopefully make the right choice.
1.1.13.1.3. Con: The increase is made by economic and political interests coming together, and making a business without people's consent. Obesity in the world is increasing, should we boost the increase?
1.1.13.2. Pro: There would be severely less dishes that have meat as a key ingredient and thus would lead to a loss of dishes that have evolved over thousands of years, even those that are part of the culture of countries.
1.1.13.2.1. Con: Human cuisine has always evolved, especially in recent years with the wider availability of different foods. The void that losing some traditional dishes creates can easily be filled.
1.1.13.3. Con: If so many people are happy with eating meat, then so many people \(namely [millennials](https://munchies.vice.com/en_uk/article/9a8gve/this-is-why-millennials-are-all-turning-vegan)\) would not be trending away from it. Apparently people are not happy with the omnivore diet as they become more aware of the downsides of it, and are taking action to avoid it for better alternatives \(like veganism\).
1.1.13.4. Con: That does not justify causing animal suffering when it can be avoided.
1.1.13.4.1. Con: Suffering \(like being unhappy\) should not transition onto humans just because we do not want to create suffering in others \(like animals\). This just makes net suffering as equal as before, not different.
1.1.13.4.1.1. Pro: Humans should think of themselves first before helping others. Without humans being well-off in a transition, then it is not worthwhile. This extends to veganism.
1.1.13.4.1.2. Con: Veganism does not cause humans significant suffering.
1.1.13.4.1.3. Con: While veganism might cause short term unhappiness in some people during the transition period, it has long-term benefits for the whole planet. Sacrificing short-lived pleasures for a greater goal is the basis of many of our human endeavours \(e.g. saving for retirement\).
1.1.13.4.2. Pro: Compassion is more morally and ethically important than taste.
1.1.13.5. Con: Something feeling good to do does not mean that it is morally justified.
1.1.13.5.1. Pro: Human meat can taste good, violence can feel good. Because it comes at the expense of another conscious being, it's not a good enough reason to do it.
1.1.13.5.2. Pro: This argument assumes a position that people should do whatever pleases them regardless of consequences.
1.1.13.5.3. Pro: The argument that something tastes good has no moral value, it in no ways can be valid. Some may say anything tastes good, but if it has no health benefits so one limits his consumption of the produce, and if there is no valid point to continue to use such product then the person totally avoids it. Most of all because it harms the products environment in many ways.
1.1.13.6. Con: Happiness from good food is not limited to meals containing animal products. Most of the time, it's about interesting textures, umami and the social aspect of eating together. By focusing on those essential aspects of eating out / eating together, people can gain comparable happiness on a vegan diet.
1.1.13.7. Con: People can also gain substantial happiness from aligning their morals \(not wanting to hurt animals\) with their actions - by not eating animals. A clear\(er\) conscience can be a great source of happiness.
1.1.13.8. Con: As the technology improves, synthetic meat substitutes will inevitably become more economical, more nutritious, and better tasting than natural meat products.
1.1.13.8.1. Con: The specific diet and lifestyle of an animal has a [dramatic effect](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/will-chicken-thats-fed-lemons-taste-lemons) on its flavour, this would not be easy to replicate in a laboratory.
1.1.13.8.2. Con: Laboratory produced food means that some laboratories will have food monopolies. Thus poor countries will have to pay extortionate amounts to buy food that they won't be able to produce by themselves, because their production of it is not vegan.
1.1.13.8.2.1. Pro: If lab food is produced at a rate that exceeds consumption, post-scarcity would be achieved. The technology to produce meat in this way should be public knowledge for the world to use. It should be a public service, first provided by the government, and private entities can sell their own product to attempt to compete with the government's free product. If they fail, capitalism will have taken one more step toward its demise.
1.1.13.8.3. Pro: Many vegan products already taste good, it's just that many people don't know it.
1.1.13.8.3.1. Con: Just because broccoli tastes good doesn't mean we can't have ice cream.
1.1.13.8.4. Con: While synthetic meat substitutes may be feasible, these means won't be economical for a long time. To get truly nutritionally equivalent meat at a similar price could take decades, as this start-up [discusses](https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-to-serve-up-chicken-strips-cultivated-from-cells-in-lab-1489570202) by describing their meat substitute and their pricing projections for the future.
1.1.13.8.5. Con: We may, one day, create synthetic meat that has more flavour, more nutrients and requires 0 animal deaths. But we are not there yet \(all experimental artificial meats are less nutrient and have different taste\), so we are still justified to seek the best nutrition possible, given how nutrition is important in to biology.
1.1.13.9. Pro: If all humans were vegan, all restaurants would be vegan, which would make society worse off overall.
1.1.13.9.1. Con: If everybody were vegan, all restaurant owners and clients would be vegan: nobody would ever complain about all restaurants being vegan, so the claim that it would make society worse off overall is false.
1.1.13.9.2. Pro: Most people dislike vegan food.
1.1.13.9.2.1. Con: Many people would like vegan food if they tried and were used to it.
1.1.13.9.2.2. Con: People might not like the idea of eating only vegan, but most non-vegan foods have vegan ingredients. For instance, the meat most people eat tastes so good because it's been seasoned with vegan spices.
1.1.13.10. Pro: Cooked meats have powerful [stimulating effects](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/what-makes-a-hamburger-and-other-cooked-meat-so-enticing-to-humans/2013/08/12/8f8e1d72-ff73-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html?utm_term=.570f6f6d1816) on human sensory pleasure.
1.1.14. Con: Free humans who are adequately informed and supported would make the correct choice, whatever that may be. This conversation is intended to find what that correct choice is, not decide top-down what we should force on individuals.
1.1.14.1. Pro: Educating about veganism and creating the right conditions for people to choose vegan options more often is not equal to paternalism.
1.1.15. Pro: It is immoral to restrict the rights of other humans to eat animals, so long as in doing so they do not infringe on the rights of other humans.
1.1.15.1. Con: Humans should not be given special treatment solely out of morality as humans are animals too. They should be allowed to be eaten if they are weak, because morality is subjective and has no function in my quest for survival through nourishment.
1.1.15.2. Pro: True, that is why veganism works, because people's rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is infringed due to the few people that want to eat meat.
1.1.15.2.1. Pro: With global warming threatening human existence, many people will not have the capability to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Thus, not being vegan infringes on the rights of everyone just trying to exist.
1.1.15.3. Con: It is immoral to restrict the rights of animals in order to give humans more rights \(especially when humans do not need animals to live\).
1.1.15.4. Con: Humans are not inherently better than other animals \(an idea propped up by religion: [Genesis 1:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26&version=NIV) [Genesis 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27&version=NIV)\), only evidently more cruel, subjecting animals to [confinement from birth, mutilation, and imbalanced diet to manipulate growth.](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/factory-farming/animal-cruelty/) These aren't practiced by carnivorous animals in nature.
1.1.15.4.1. Con: Religion shows otherwise, that eating animals makes humans worse off \(as we are not above them\), not better. "Be not among drunkards or among gluttonous eaters of meat, for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and slumber will clothe them with rags" Proverbs 23:20-21.
1.1.15.5. Pro: The well-being of men has more value than the well-being of animals.
1.1.15.5.1. Con: The well-being of humans and the well-being of animals are not mutually exclusive.
1.1.15.5.2. Con: Every individual values his personal well-being the highest; human as well as animal. We should not justify imposing our will upon others because of this, human or animal.
1.1.15.5.3. Pro: Causing animals suffering, while regrettable, is not reason enough to deprive people of an entire category of food.
1.1.15.5.4. Con: Animal lives are of sufficient value that we should not just kill them when non-animal alternatives exist.
1.1.15.5.4.1. Pro: Veganism is a moral imperative. Since nonhuman animals are sentient, can suffer, and have a will to live, critics of animal rights would have to explain why those traits are not sufficient to grant animals such rights given they are the basis for moral treatment of fellow humans. Critics need to name what trait humans have that other animals don't have that justify such differential treatment, such that a human lacking this trait can be killed for food without it being immoral.
1.1.15.5.4.2. Con: If one is concerned with numbers of deaths of living organisms, then this argument is actually in support of voluntary suicide via starvation, as many plants must be killed or aborted to support the life of one human being.
1.1.15.5.4.2.1. Con: When considering morality, it is necessary to draw a line. It is unlikely that most humans would adopt a moral position that requires them to starve themselves to death, therefore it is necessary to strike a balance between surviving and acting ethically.
1.1.15.5.4.3. Pro: Fur coats [not needed](http://www.haveyoupackedthecamera.com/blog/articles/antarctica/antarcticaClothingOuterLayer.htm) for warmth in any weather condition, thus they lead to the pointless and [cruel](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1366983/How-ethical-fur-fashion-industrys-cynical-yet.html) death of many animals.
1.1.15.5.4.4. Con: Animals only have value because they give value to humans.
1.1.15.5.4.4.1. Pro: They taste good.
1.1.15.5.4.5. Con: The proposition at hand relates to veganism, which goes substantially beyond simply not killing animals. Any discussion of the ethics of killing animals is an argument in favor of vegetarianism, but not veganism per se.
1.1.15.5.4.6. Pro: Animals are [sentient](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/welfare_en), which relates to having moral value.
1.1.15.5.4.7. Con: The life of an animal does not have enough value to outweigh the benefits of killing and consuming them.
1.1.15.5.4.8. Con: Animals do not have similar levels of [emotional comprehension](https://www.thoughtco.com/do-insects-feel-pain-1968409) or intelligence \([1](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KtMisEcJcwc/TFTVGEG6zhI/AAAAAAAABRo/namNhbv_brM/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/moravec+-+1900-2030+machine+intelligence.jpg), [2](http://www.archure.net/p/bbbGIFxx.GIF)\) to humans. Therefore they are of less value.
1.1.15.5.4.8.1. Con: 'Chattel animals' are not one species or group of species. There is a lot of variety. For example, [pigs](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animal-emotions/201506/pigs-are-intelligent-emotional-and-cognitively-complex) are a lot more intelligent than most animals.
1.1.15.5.4.8.2. Con: The [ability to suffer](https://boingboing.net/2011/06/30/richard-dawkins-on-v.html) on a physical or even psychological level is not related or correlated to comprehension/intelligence.
1.1.15.5.4.8.2.1. Pro: Many mammals can get the same or at least very [similar mental conditions as humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_psychopathology), including depression, OCD, anxiety disorders, etc.
1.1.15.5.4.8.3. Con: There are [difficulties in measuring emotional and general intelligence](https://www.smh.com.au/national/scientific-studies-of-animal-intelligence-and-emotion-reveal-surprising-traits-20150703-gi4nbh.html). To base a life's value on subjective ranking does not make sense.
1.1.15.5.4.8.3.1. Pro: Many times intelligence and emotion look substandard to humans because there are different types and humans might not be able to recognize the other types in other animals. For instance, fish feel pain, but people don't believe that they do, because [fish emotionally react differently to pain than humans do](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130808123719.htm).
1.1.15.5.4.8.4. Con: Humans are not [unique with abilities and skills, and if anything, worse than other animals](https://visual.ly/community/infographic/science/difference-between-humans-and-animals). That does make humans less valuable. Basing value on criteria does not make sense in regard to abilities and skill.
1.1.15.5.4.8.5. Con: Some humans are born with disorders that greatly reduce their cognitive / physical abilities, yet we do not deem it ethical to kill humans of much lesser intelligence. We currently base the value of an animal on its species, not its abilities, intelligence or sentience.
1.1.15.5.4.8.6. Con: Intelligence and emotional comprehension are hard to measure and all such measurements are taken from a human point of view, so it's only natural that humans come out on top in such comparisons. Vegans base their moral considerations on empathy \(recognizing that non-human animals have many of the same needs as humans as well as the capability to suffer\) instead of pseudo-objective measurements of intelligence.
1.1.15.5.4.8.6.1. Con: Even vegans are humans, so they have biases too. Vegans vary widely in their beliefs as to what is considered 'sentient' \(from those believing [bivalves](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) are not sentient to vegans to think [insects](https://www.ourhenhouse.org/2013/10/a-vegan-angel-of-death/) are fine to kill\). The best method is to treat all life with respect and dignity and have science create a universal standard for all to follow.
1.1.15.5.4.8.6.2. Pro: Animals, with their variety, react differently to stimuli \(such as [fish feeling pain and respond differently than humans](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130808123719.htm), but still emotionally\). Because they react differently, humans do not take it seriously or say their responses even exist or have merit. That is why people do not believe animals are intelligent or smart \(or at the same level\), when it reality they are, just differently \(but at times equally\).
1.1.15.5.4.8.6.3. Pro: Many meat supporters believe that when animals react to a stimuli, it is just a reaction rather than emotion. However, emotion is also a reaction. Thus, humans do not look at everything equally, or display a bias just because it is convenient \(even when it does not make sense\).
1.1.16. Con: If there is no difference between the cost, taste, nutrients, etc. between synthetic meat and natural meat, preferring the latter is simply hateful and nonsensical, as it implies being content with contributing to animal deaths.
1.1.16.1. Con: Killing does not necessarily involve suffering. It is, in fact, a natural part of life, and is not innately immoral.
1.1.16.1.1. Con: The parent claim did not state that killing was inherently immoral. It stated that it is immoral to take a life out of spite when it is not necessary for survival.
1.1.16.1.1.1. Con: The parent did not claim that the life is being taken out of 'spite.' It did, however, claim that animals 'suffer' when killed or cooked after being killed, which is false.
1.1.16.1.2. Con: Animals in the wild act based on instinct, not morality, and are therefore not suited as role models for our modern society. Rape, cannibalism, coprophagy and infanticide are prevalent in the animal kingdom, yet we humans reject such acts.
1.1.16.1.2.1. Con: As well as eating other forms of life, animals also drink water, breathe air, and defend themselves when threatened. Just because animals instinctively partake in a particular behavior does not implicitly make it an amoral act.
1.1.16.1.3. Con: Even if killing was without suffering, it does not make it OK or morally valid.
1.1.16.2. Con: If advancements in the field of cellular agriculture / in vitro meat will lead to people choosing the cruelty-free option anyways, one could argue that there is no reason to go vegan now while these alternatives do not exist.
1.1.16.3. Pro: When we reach that point, animal suffering \(a.k.a. killing animals for no purpose, so they die in vain\) should naturally be abandoned and maybe enforced. Some movements already support banning hunting and fishing as "fun" to avoid having animals be cooked after a horrible death.
1.2. Pro: A vegan diet is healthier for humans.
1.2.1. Pro: A vegan diet clears the conscience \(with ideas like knowing it is less cruel and more eco-friendly\), which could lead to [less stress](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/1476830514Y.0000000164) \(about health\) in life.
1.2.1.1. Con: Vegetarian diets are [connected](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5868-9-67) to an increased incidence of mental health disorders including depression, anxiety and OCD.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: This is an association finding, with no proven causal link. [Quote](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1479-5868-9-67?site=ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com) from the authors: "there was no evidence for a causal role of vegetarian diet in the etiology of mental disorders."
1.2.1.1.2. Con: This paper is 18 years old. Society's response to veganism is different now, and so is the average vegan.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: This paper only studies responses to one particular group - German respondents to a German national survey.
1.2.1.1.4. Con: The results favour a psychological [explanation](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1479-5868-9-67?site=ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com): "For depressive disorders, anxiety
disorders, and somatoform disorders and syndromes we found that on average the adoption of the vegetarian diet follows the onset of mental disorders."
1.2.1.1.5. Con: "The experience of a mental disorder may [sensitize](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1479-5868-9-67?site=ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com) individuals to the suffering of other living beings, including animals".
1.2.1.1.6. Con: This [paper](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1479-5868-9-67?site=ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com) conflates people who eat plant-based diets for health reasons with those who do it for ethical reasons \(vegans\).
1.2.1.1.6.1. Pro: "Elevated levels of health-related anxiety [may lead](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1479-5868-9-67?site=ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com) individuals with mental disorders to choose a vegetarian diet as a form of safety or self-protective behavior, because a meat free diet is perceived as more healthy".
1.2.1.1.6.2. Pro: "Individuals with a history of a mental disorder [may exhibit](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1479-5868-9-67?site=ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com) more perceived health-oriented behavior in order to positively influence the course of their disease."
1.2.1.1.7. Con: The presented paper investigates vegetarians in a society \(German\) not welcoming to vegetarians. Research in societies positively valuing vegetarianism \(Seventh Day Adventists\) showed an [association](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20515497) with positive mood.
1.2.1.2. Pro: People claim they love animals and would rather not see footage of animals being killed, yet they eat them. Refraining from eating animals would resolve this cognitive dissonance.
1.2.2. Pro: People might be more aware of their impacts on their health and environment if they go vegan, which can help them get towards a healthier lifestyle \(due to giving their health more scrutiny, research, and educational insights\).
1.2.2.1. Con: People care about their health or not. Choosing a certain diet is part of a health choice. Forcing someone to adopt a certain diet is not making people more health conscious.
1.2.3. Pro: The [World Health Organisation](http://www.who.int/elena/titles/fruit_vegetables_ncds/en/) and national health ministries encourage adding more fruits and veggies to the plate.
1.2.4. Pro: Diets including meat, dairy, and eggs increase the risk of [heart disease among other conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm).
1.2.4.1. Pro: For those looking to eat a healthy diet, keeping intake of eggs [moderate to low](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/eggs/) will be best for most, emphasizing plant-based protein options when possible.
1.2.4.2. Pro: When [dairy fat](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2016/10/25/dairy-fat-cardiovascular-disease-risk/) was replaced with the same number of calories from vegetable fat or polyunsaturated fat, the risk of cardiovascular disease dropped by 10% and 24%, respectively.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Dairy consumption is unhealthy.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Dairy over the last few thousand years has given it's users resilient food sources and contributed to increased survival rates of humans and population growth... for those who can stomach it.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: It's unhealthy for those without Lactose tolerance, which is trackable as a gene mutation, and some tribes of early sapiens flourished with it, but even a thousand years ago in what is now Germany, less than 50% of people had lactose tolerance. aDNA tests of people in medieval German graves. 30% of the tested individuals from the 10th century had the alleles. 50% of the tested 16th century people. i.e. in Sapiens terms it's very recent addition and 'paleo' diets don't need it.
1.2.4.3.3. Pro: It is argued that IGF-1 in dairy may be unhealthy.
1.2.4.3.3.1. Pro: Some argue it [may lead](https://chestsculpting.com/milk-and-dairy-for-guys-with-man-boobs/) to men developing breast tissue.
1.2.4.3.3.2. Con: While drinking milk may raise IGF-1 levels there is [some evidence](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/93/17/1330/2519487) that overall it is protective from colorectal cancer.
1.2.4.3.4. Pro: [Anecdotal evidence](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/healthyeating/10868428/Give-up-dairy-products-to-beat-cancer.html) has associated dairy consumption with breast cancer.
1.2.4.3.4.1. Con: The UK Cancer Society suggests that, on a synthesis of the evidence, while it is not conclusive, dairy may in fact [be protective](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/breast-cancer/risks-causes/diet) from breast cancer.
1.2.4.3.5. Pro: Excess dairy consumption is associated with lower bone density as a result of the nuances in calcium metabolism.
1.2.4.3.6. Con: Access to and consumption of dairy is [associated with](http://blog.usdec.org/usdairyexporter/dairy-makes-a-case-as-a-remedy-for-malnutrition) a reduction in vitamin deficiencies in communities at risk of malnutrition.
1.2.4.4. Pro: If people eat vegan, they can prevent deadly complications from top medical diseases that meat contributes to.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: If people are less likely to get medical conditions with a vegan diet, they should be less likely to get [drug overdoses](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/node/2003) \(with leads to death\) from treating their preventable diseases too.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Medical errors are the [3rd leading cause of death in the US](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-05-03/medical-errors-are-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-the-us). People who follow a vegan lifestyle to avoid preventable diseases would less likely get and require treatment for them \(which increases their risk of medical errors\).
1.2.4.5. Con: There is no scientific back-up of the claim that animal products cause heart disease. Only some very biased, low-quality papers claim that. All high-quality studies proved the opposite.
1.2.4.6. Con: The all cause mortality of vegans is 22.5% higher than of meat eater according to the EPIC study, Oxford. Picking just one disease is misleading. You can die only once.
1.2.4.6.1. Con: [Respondents](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988204/) \(n=6,381\) aged 50–65 reporting high protein intake had a 75% increase in overall mortality and a 4-fold increase in cancer and diabetes mortality during an 18 year follow up period. These associations were either abolished or attenuated if the source of proteins was plant-based.
1.2.5. Con: It is possible to eat an unhealthy vegan diet.
1.2.5.1. Pro: People can still eat junk food and be unhealthy, as many junk foods are vegan \(fries, condiments, soda, candy...\). The world going vegan does not stop people's consumption of junk food and its negative health consequences too.
1.2.5.2. Pro: People can still eat components that are unhealthy on an omnivore diet in a vegan one \(such as excessive saturated fats, sugars, and salt\). A healthier diet would be a modified diet not only eliminating animal products, but also sources in excess of disease-triggering \(like [heart disease](https://www.mdedge.com/sites/default/files/Document/September-2017/JFP_06307_Article1.pdf)\) nutrients.
1.2.5.3. Pro: [Pesticide intakes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27588700) are higher on a vegan diet, which makes an organic vegan diet healthier.
1.2.5.4. Pro: It is impossible to get all nutriants from plant-source alone.
1.2.5.5. Pro: Many vegan options have significant amounts of sodium to compensate for the lack of taste
1.2.5.6. Pro: While there is nutrition of all forms available to the vegan, bioavailability and difficulty in acquisition/cost is much greater, reducing the probability of a successful healthful vegan diet.
1.2.5.6.1. Con: Cost is dependent also on demand. This argument thus relies on the fact that most people are not vegan to justify non-veganism. This argument therefore includes an appeal to the [bandwagon fallacy](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-bandwagon-fallacy-1689158).
1.2.5.6.2. Pro: In the United States, fruits and vegetables are [more expensive than meat](https://depts.washington.edu/uwcphn/news/presentations/Drewnowski%20cost%20of%20healthy%20foods%20051612%20\[Compatibility%20Mode\].pdf) when considered [isocalorically](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/isocaloric).
1.2.6. Con: A vegan diet might not be healthier for everyone, especially those with medical conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome or ones where they cannot metabolize nutrients that meat provides.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Vitamin A \(retinol \([1](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/retinol#section=Top), 2\) - because it is in "[retinas](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Vitamin_A2#section=Top)"\) is [only found](http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/topics/vitamina.html) in animal sources. The body can only acquire it on a vegan diet by converting beta-carotene to this,
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: People genetically not able to convert beta-carotene to Vitamin A would not be recommended for a vegan diet. The double whammy comes to them when beta-carotene buildup in the body presents [health problems](https://www.mygenefood.com/can-vegans-get-enough-vitamin-answer-may-genetic/) of its own.
1.2.6.1.2. Con: This is good, because as one of the articles mentioned, vegans cannot get Vitamin A toxicity.
1.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.1.
1.2.6.3. Pro: People with Celiac disease cannot eat wheat, which is a major source of [protein](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/wheat) for vegan diets.
1.2.6.4. Con: Many of these individuals could still be on a vegan diet if they modify their food choices. They may have more restrictions than the general population, but will still maintain the possibility for going in the same direction as everyone.
1.2.7. Pro: A vegan diet takes a lot less time consuming to eat healthy and delicious food. The convenience helps more people to stick to a healthy diet.
1.2.7.1. Con: A vegan diet is far more inconvenient than an omnivorous diet.
1.2.7.1.1. Pro: 'Quick food' options, like fast food restaurants and convenience stores, have very few \(if any\) vegan choices. Most of a vegan's diet realistically must be made rather than bought. For people with particularly busy lifestyles, this inconvenience can be a deal-breaker.
1.2.7.1.2. Pro: The vegan diet ranks abysmally on the [top 40 most popular diets](https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/best-easy-diets) when ranking by convenience, tying for 36th place. The vast majority of popular diets are far more convenient than veganism.
1.2.8. Con: Vegan foods might have negative health consequences not seen with animal sources.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Many vegan foods are not healthy for humans due to their [anti-nutrients](https://draxe.com/antinutrients/), such as oxalates and solanine. This can prevent people from absorbing nutrients they typically absorb in meat.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: Legumes in general, and soybeans in particular negatively impact the thyroid and create issues with it's function \(like goiter - [1](https://academic.oup.com/endo/article-abstract/61/5/570/2775031), [2](https://search.proquest.com/openview/20a517f8041e1e1dc3a567d9a481eec3/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1056336)\). Legumes is a [primary source](http://www.dietplanlist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/raw-vegan-diet-eating-plan-2d4605cd97bf2361445530e34ef140b8-PLYanB.jpg) of protein in the vegan diet.
1.2.8.2. Pro: Supposedly vegan foods might secretly contain non-vegan components on them, like [shellac and gelatin on bananas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713516306089).
1.2.8.2.1. Pro: If people grow their own food when vegan, then they can make more informed choices about what is in their food and not resort to eating non-vegan food unintentionally.
1.2.8.2.2. Pro: These non-vegan components can become a health risk, especially if a person is avoiding non-vegan foods due to allergies \(such as the [gelatin](https://www.foodallergy.org/common-allergens/other-food-allergens) and possibly shellac \([1](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Or%20Shellac%20Technical%20Evaluation%20Report%20%282014%29.pdf), [2](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Or%20Shellac%20Technical%20Advisory%20Panel%20Report%20%282002%29.pdf)\) on bananas\).
1.2.8.3. Pro: Vegans need artificial iron every so often: iron supplements aren't easily absorved \(including the liquid supplements\), provoking over time digestion problems and may be not absorved at all, so the anemia problems would be incrementing.
1.2.8.3.1. Pro: This is especially true if the supplement does not contain or is not taken with vitamins that help absorb it, like Vitamin C \(which is crucial for non-heme iron absorption\)
1.2.9. Con: A restrictive diet has harmful long-term consequences.
1.2.9.1. Pro: Choosing to follow a restrictive diet can make it harder to engage with social events, as eating in restaurants is [more difficult](http://ohsheglows.com/2013/02/06/10-tips-for-eating-out-as-a-vegan/).
1.2.9.2. Pro: Sharing food is a [fundamental part](https://www.npr.org/2017/02/02/512998465/why-eating-the-same-food-increases-peoples-trust-and-cooperation) of human bonding, being vegan makes this [difficult](https://cadryskitchen.com/2015/04/23/vegan-party-etiquette/).
1.2.9.2.1. Con: The main claim is that all humans should become vegan, thus this claim is not valid. If all humans became vegan, then vegan food would be the food shared by people and it would again have the positive effects that this claim proposes.
1.2.9.2.2. Con: Vegan food is actually easier to share, because there is more abundance due to less resources needed to grow vegan food.
1.2.9.2.3. Con: Vegan food is meant to be shared, especially with fruit. Some fruit are so big \(like watermelon, jackfruit, and breadfruit\) that it would be extremely difficult for one person to eat it alone.
1.2.9.2.4. Con: A cornucopia \(a basket overflowing with fruit and vegetables\) is symbolic of a [plentiful harvest](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cornucopia). That [abundance](https://www.brighthubeducation.com/history-homework-help/126590-what-is-a-cornucopia/) historically gets shared around Thanksgiving, when everyone feasts well. [Turkeys](http://time.com/4120730/thanksgiving-turkey-history/) are only a later, American addition to Thanksgiving.
1.2.9.3. Pro: This type of diet may be hard to follow, and thus bad on the psyche \(such as guilt\) when veering from it.
1.2.9.4. Con: Veganism is not restrictive in the sense that there is a lot of vegetal foods. Usually, [vegans tend to actually have a more diversified diet](http://letthemeatmeat.com/post/2138656446/does-going-vegan-increase-dietary-variety). This claim is uninformed.
1.2.9.5. Pro: [It is good for health](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/food-variety-and-dietary-diversity-scores-in-children-are-they-good-indicators-of-dietary-adequacy/369C0198716A89F501B9881A80566CDB) to have as wide a diet as possible to provide diversity.
1.2.9.5.1. Pro: [There is possitive corelation between diet diversity and Height for Age Z-scores \(HAZ\).​](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/134/10/2579/4688437)
1.2.10. Con: A vegan diet would cause more health issues at times than benefits, which makes it less desirable than not switching to it.
1.2.10.1. Pro: In the [top 8 food allergens](https://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm079311.htm), vegan food rank among them \(soy, tree nuts, peanuts, and wheat\). Being vegan places people allergic to these foods more at-risk of being affected by them.
1.2.10.1.1. Con: The top 8 food allergens list leads with milk, eggs, fish, crustaceans. [Milk allergies are the most common on the list.](http://www.stormsallergy.com/control/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/FoodAllergies.png)
1.2.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.2.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.1.
1.2.10.4. Pro: Veganism is supposed to lessen disease, but instead vegan-specific diseases will increase, such as [phytophotodermatitis](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1119566-overview).
1.2.11. Con: New unhealthy habits/lifestyles might come with a vegan diet and outweigh its benefits.
1.2.11.1. Con: People might not go out to restaurants as much \(due to a lack of options\), which is healthier.
1.2.11.2. Pro: People might buy processed food more on a vegan diet, because they do not know how to cook their own.
1.2.11.2.1. Pro: This is especially true, as food needs to be combined for better absorption and completion \(with antinutrients and incomplete protein sources of vegan food\).
1.2.11.2.2. Con: Non-vegan diets will also contain large quantities of processed foods if the person does not know how to cook. In some ways, being on a vegan diet forces you to cook with more basic ingredients as there fewer convenience vegan foods and unhealthy alternatives are less accessible.
1.2.11.3. Con: If vegans grow their own food \(especially hydroponic - [cleaner/less water usage, lower emissions...](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/0b/37/7d/0b377d6f9c09d918ca60828c2ee0b6e8.jpg)\), their diet would be healthier yet on the planet/people.
1.2.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.4.8.
1.2.11.5. Pro: These habits are unhealthy for these types of vegans, but also those around them \(through a negative influence\).
1.2.12. Con: Food from animal origins contain nutritional values that vegan food lacks.  These cannot be supplemented on a vegan diet.
1.2.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.2.13. Pro: The way [meat is produced](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/18/vegetarianism-save-planet-environment) spreads disease, and promotes antibiotic resistance. Going vegan will drastically lower the chances of getting ill from antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
1.2.13.1. Con: Deadly infections in food are mainly spread by vegetables as all statistics about food safety show.
1.2.13.2. Con: Some chickens do not contain any antibiotics. They run all day long around the park to stay healthy. Meat mass productions' unhealthy methods may not be confused with meat's own properties.
1.2.13.3. Con: This is a problem no matter the crop - plant based agriculture creates the same problems for pest resistance in the form of insects, weeds and moulds.
1.2.13.3.1. Con: While this may be true the resistance occurs in organisms which are not a direct threat to humans, whereas animal pathogens can [jump to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis) humans carrying with them their resistances.
1.2.13.4. Pro: The spread of disease in animals is more likely to [pass to humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis) than disease in plant crops due to genetic and biochemical similarities.
1.2.14. Con: Each year, health experts rank the [40 most popular diets](https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/best-diets-overall) to determine which are the best overall. Veganism ties with two others for 19th. When the list is adjusted to focus exclusively on the healthiest diets without regard to other factors, veganism does [even worse](https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/best-healthy-eating-diets), tying for 27th. Out of the 40 most popular diets, it is clear that veganism is one of the least healthy choices.
1.2.14.1. Pro: The two diets tied for first place in both the rankings of [healthiest](https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/best-healthy-eating-diets) and [best overall](https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/best-diets-overall), the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet, both require the consumption of meat and animal products, particularly fish, eggs, and fat-free dairy. Veganism's ranking is abysmal on both scales, indicating that animal products are necessary for the healthiest diets.
1.2.15. Pro: Improving the health behavior of individuals through veganism is a health factor that increases their health outcome \([1](https://www.healthcatalyst.com/population-health/)\) individually.
1.2.15.1. Pro: Veganism promotes other healthier life choices which can impact [diabetes](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/enjoy-food/eating-with-diabetes/veganism-and-diabetes), [heart disease](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-right-plant-based-diet-for-you), [arthritis](https://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/arthritis-diet/anti-inflammatory/vegan-and-vegetarian-diets.php), [cancer](http://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/en/), and more, for the positive.
1.2.16. Pro: A vegan diet has scientifically been proven to treat and reverse coronary heart disease [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25198208)
1.2.17. Con: Plants contain huge amounts of phytotoxins that destroy the health if consumed in high quantities or longterm. Plants defend them self with these toxins.
1.2.18. Con: A vegan diet is based on starch and sugar that is extremely unhealthy.
1.2.19. Pro: There is [mounting evidence](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/health) that humans can not only survive, but thrive on plant-based diet.
1.2.19.1. Pro: Vegan diets provide more fibre, a nutrient that [97% of Americans are short on](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/142/7/1390S/4630933).
1.2.19.1.1. Con: Nutrients like fibre can also be provided by non-vegan diets.
1.2.19.2. Pro: 58% of omnivores were deficient in [folic acid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26502280) according to a 2017 study in Switzerland.
1.2.19.3. Pro: Vegan populations have, on average, a [lower body mass index](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26853923) \(closer to center of healthy range\) than people following an omnivorous diet.
1.2.19.3.1. Con: A lower body mass index doesn't necessarily mean that someone is healthy. BMI actually has some [limitations](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/obesity/bmi-limitations.php) as it is only a measure of excess weight not of imbalances in healthy levels \(such as that of protein, fat, bone, and more\).
1.2.19.3.1.1. Con: Vegans have a lower BMI due to being healthier \([less fat](http://www.vegkitchen.com/nutrition/do-vegans-have-a-weight-loss-advantage/)\).
1.2.19.3.1.2. Pro: Vegans tend to have a lower BMI with [less bone density \(due to less calcium intake\)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9edd/5f5979f74cfdd9778722dc4a74bac1ca7894.pdf).
1.2.19.3.1.2.1. Con: According to the [article](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9edd/5f5979f74cfdd9778722dc4a74bac1ca7894.pdf), if vegans eat the same amount of calcium as omnivores, their bone density becomes the same. Thus, bone density has nothing to do with protein, but instead with calcium.
1.2.19.3.1.2.2. Pro: This is compounded by the fact that people lose bone density [as they age.](https://www.bones.nih.gov/health-info/bone/osteoporosis/bone-mass)
1.2.19.3.1.3. Con: There is [no difference](http://veggieprotein.com.br/artigos/cacao-amendoa/5.pdf) between vegans and non-vegetarians in terms of muscle mass.
1.2.19.3.1.3.1. Pro: Muscle mass increases and decreases with factors outside of diet, such as [creatine supplementation](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/13d9/247db5b39254ee6a786176c7eed63d04b2c2.pdf) and [age](https://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/guide/sarcopenia-with-aging).
1.2.19.3.2. Con: The lower BMI has nothing to do with not consuming animal products. Vegans are simply guided to healthier food as there are fewer unhealthy vegan options. If non-vegans also ate healthier options, the same effect \(a lower BMI\) could be achieved without following a vegan diet.
1.2.19.4. Pro: Vegan and vegetarian diets have been [associated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3662288/) with a lower risk of many chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer and type two diabetes. Lowering chronic disease burden would have a net positive impact on society \(by decreasing health care spending for instance\) while benefiting individuals.
1.2.19.4.1. Pro: LDL Cholesterol caused diseases are killing millions of people every year in the western world, and a vegan diet would have prevented them.
1.2.19.4.1.1. Pro: Saturated fats [raise LDL cholesterol](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Cholesterol/PreventionTreatmentofHighCholesterol/The-Skinny-on-Fats_UCM_305628_Article.jsp#.WtV9mNP49E5) and the majority of saturated fat comes from animal sources.
1.2.19.4.1.2. Pro: Vegans have significantly [reduced risk of ischemic heart disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26853923) compared to people following an omnivorous diet.
1.2.19.4.1.3. Con: Any specialized diet would prevent cholesterol caused diseases. Most people have very bad diets and having any dietary lifestyle would be beneficial.
1.2.19.4.1.4. Con: A healthy diet would have helped to prevent them, a vegan diet is not necessary.
1.2.19.4.2. Pro: A whole-food plant-based diet that excludes animal products and refined foods is [beneficial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5466941/) for preventing and treating type 2 diabetes.
1.2.19.4.2.1. Con: Recent [research](http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2816%2935229-5/abstract) is controversially showing that [diets](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/keto/) high in animal protein and fat and severely limiting carbohydrates are long term a better option for type II diabetics than diets high in complex carbohydrates and low in fats.
1.2.19.4.3. Con: It is likely that people choosing vegan diet are more aware of dietetics than ordinary people \(and thus act accordingly to protect their health\). The majority of our society do not think about healthy food and diseases and thus are not aware enough to act \(protect their health\) on this information.
1.2.19.4.3.1. Con: Since that is true, it is much better to have a society more aware of their health than less. Thus, this only emphasizes the realization more towards veganism.
1.2.20. Con: It is possible to eat a healthy diet that includes meat and animal products.
1.2.20.1. Con: While diets that include meat and animal products may be healthy, often their "healthiness" comes from reducing animal products.
1.2.20.1.1. Con: As shown by a ranking of the [top 40 most popular diets](https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/best-healthy-eating-diets), veganism ranks quite low, while all 26 diets that ranked higher include some animal products. This indicates that, while a reduction in animal product consumption, specifically certain types of products, like red meat, do in fact improve health when compared to a typical western diet, it is still healthier to keep some animal products, specifically things like fish and eggs.
1.2.20.2. Pro: Consuming animal products is healthy.
1.2.20.2.1. Con: It's [not obvious](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-beast/201610/do-humans-need-meat) that there's anything specifically beneficial about eating meat, and a healthy person with modest financial resources in an industrialized country can easily meet all normal dietary requirements on a vegan diet.
1.2.20.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.3.
1.2.20.2.3. Con: Meat contains the essential vitamin [B12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12), yet this B12 is often [supplemented](http://www.theglowingfridge.com/vitamin-b12-not-just-vegans/) into the [animal's food](http://www.farmhealthonline.com/disease-management/cattle-diseases/cobalt-deficiency/). Therefore when supplementing B12 yourself and eating healthy, meat is obsolete.
1.2.20.2.4. Pro: Animal products have [benefits](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/meat-food-group-body-4118.html) for [appetite](https://www.nature.com/news/2006/060904/full/news060904-3.html), [metabolism](https://www.medicaldaily.com/3-benefits-eating-meat-234798), iron absorption and the health of your muscles. While you may find these in vegetables it doesn't change that they can be gained from a healthy meat diet. Just because vegetables are healthy doesn't mean meat isn't.
1.2.20.2.5. Con: WHO \(World Health Organisation\) deems processed meat [carcinogenic](http://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/en/) and red meat a probable carcinogen.
1.2.20.2.6. Pro: Meat is an excellent source of iron [\(Pereira & Vicente, 2013\)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0309174012003385), while milk-based products are an excellent source of calcium and fatty acids \([Pereira, 2014](https://www.lbs.co.il/data/attachment-files/2015/08/26529_milk.pdf)\).
1.2.20.3. Con: When compared side by side a plant based diet will be connected to less diseases than a meat/dairy based diet. 
If you want to eat a healthy diet including animal products you have to have a very limited consumption of it, and be super choosy about their quality and origin.
1.2.20.3.1. Pro: Dairy or meat nowadays, unless you are able source locally and organically \(which is like not the case most of the times\), is going to be filled with a lot of extra nasty products related to industrial farming, antibiotics for example.
1.2.20.4. Pro: A vegan diet is a subset of an omnivorous diet. Therefore the claim above would imply that any amount, however small, of non-vegan food would always decrease the healthiness of a diet.
1.3. Con: The definition of veganism used in this discussion is arbitrary and has no end, as it asks adherents to reduce the exploitation of animals as much as possible. This makes the cutoffs \(of what veganism is/is not\) difficult to define and thus hard to follow.
1.3.1. Pro: The vegetarian diet is easier to follow, as the definition is more concrete and objective. Foods can be scientifically analyzed to decide what is vegetarian or not. This compares to the definition of veganism, which is looser and more subjective in its interpretation.
1.3.1.1. Con: The vegetarian diet is rather morally arbitrary. E.g. killing a chicken is wrong, but killing a young rooster because it can't lay eggs is alright;  Killing cows is wrong, but killing young bulls that the milk industry can't use is alright.
1.3.1.2. Pro: For certain foods, like [oyster mushrooms](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegancirclejerk/comments/3ck3tp/are_oyster_mushrooms_vegan/), the [debates](http://letthemeatmeat.com/post/207104195/but-is-it-vegan-oyster-mushrooms) clustered around it [shape](http://www.organicauthority.com/oysters-vegan-food-or-not) the list of what is vegan and what is not.
1.3.1.3. Pro: The definition of vegetarian is "no meat", so if one follows the definition line: meat -\> flesh -\> tissues \(groups of cells and cell parts with the same function\), then one could figure out how to be a vegetarian just by avoiding eating animal tissue.
1.3.1.4. Pro: The definition of vegan has a looser interpretation, because it talks about "reducing" animal exploitation/harm. This can translate to going vegan as far as the dieter wants to go rather than everyone on the diet following the same regimen.
1.3.1.5. Con: Just because an action is easier to follow, does not mean it is the better course for humans to take.
1.3.2. Con: Veganism is [defined](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) as "a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose." "As far as is possible and practicable" means that as long as replacements are not available it is alright to use the animal product.
1.3.2.1. Con: Possible and practical are non-interchangeable words.  Further if the standard is practicable, there is no objective standard for determining the practicability of something.  It is possibly for something to be available but expensive, but it is unclear at what point it is impractically expensive.  According to this claim, perhaps one is expected you to use something because it is available, even if it isn't affordable.
1.3.2.2. Pro: This definition is not [arbitrary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/arbitrary) as it is neither defined randomly nor defined by individual preference or convenience.
1.3.3. Pro: A solution to this is for people to practice a non-animal-based diet, so that people can eat anything that are not animals: fungi, plants, cyanobacteria...This is much easier to define and follow. Along with this \(since diet is not enough\), a vegan lifestyle could be added to include other aspects of consumption, such as not wearing wool or leather.
1.3.3.1. Con: Eating unicellular organisms wipes out there life and gives preferential treatment to multicellular organisms. A better idea would be to eat only non-animal multicellular organisms without severely injuring or killing them.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Unicellular organisms do not matter much in preservation of life to humans, because unicellular organisms at times attack humans. This makes humans accepting of defending themselves, such as killing bacteria through antibiotics. So if humans kill bacteria to preserve themselves, there is no worries about killing them for other purposes for self-preservation, such as eating them.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Even if a person did not want to kill bacteria that makes them ill, so they do not harm them, their bodies unconsciously do it anyway \(through the immune system\). Killing unicellular organisms is unavoidable by humans, so there is no moral dilemma associated with it.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: People could stay healthy, so their bodies don't get sick to the point their bodies generate immune cells to kill unicellular organisms
1.3.3.2.2. Con: Just because one set of unicellular organisms are bad, doesn't make them all bad. The unicellular organisms that do not harm us do not deserve to die.
1.3.3.2.3. Con: Just because unicellular organisms attack humans, does not justify killing them. We should extend protections to all lifeforms, no matter how bad they are.
1.3.3.2.4. Con: Just because other lifeforms are harming us, does not mean we should go on a 'killing spree' because of it. Two wrongs do not make a right.
1.3.3.2.4.1. Pro: Animals can kill us, does not mean we should take revenge on them.
1.3.4. Pro: The definition could lead to issues like endless debates, in which people might decide not to be vegan \(since they would not know how to or see injustice in some people not following it as much as others\). This would make everyone being vegan a greater issue than now.
1.3.4.1. Pro: [Avoiding animal products is impossible](https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/cattle-ranching), as every atom on Earth got circulated by an animal on Earth. Thus, avoiding animal products, and thus being a vegan, is not possible on Earth.
1.3.5. Pro: Because of this, animal abuse could still take place with people calling themselves vegan,  but not following through completely, because they believe they reduced their exploitation of animals the best they could do. For example, the part "as far and is possible and practical" could loosely be interpreted to get someone to eat less meat than before, without getting rid of it completely. Thus, they still contribute to cruelty/exploitation even when following the diet/lifestyle.
1.3.5.1. Con: This approach might be detrimental to the animal cause. In terms of consumption levels, 10% [reducetarians](https://reducetarian.org/faq) would deprive of more profits to the meat industry than 1% vegans. Especially when taking into account for how long. Portraying Veganism as something difficult or purity-related may cause that Vegans [abandon their diet](https://faunalytics.org/a-summary-of-faunalytics-study-of-current-and-former-vegetarians-and-vegans/) or label and most to not even consider it. If everyone would do the best they could \(whatever that is\) there would be no animal abuse.
1.3.6. Pro: The definition is centered around animals and not people's health, which makes it more difficult for people to stick to it.
1.3.6.1. Pro: This is especially true when people get sick from it, because they did not focus on their health and instead ate junk food on it \(many junk foods are vegan, such as chips, fries, donuts, candy, soda...\)
1.3.7. Pro: For some, veganism means abstaining from all products from animals, including those that lived and died naturally.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Just because an animal died before the concept of veganism came about, does not mean that utilizing those animals for exploitative means is not vegan. In the end, animal remains are still animal products if consumed.
1.3.7.2. Con: Animals that died naturally and peacefully are fine for vegans, as no cruelty was involved in their deaths.
1.3.7.2.1. Pro: The very roots of the vegan movement are [premised](https://www.vegansociety.com/sites/default/files/uploads/Ripened%20by%20human%20determination.pdf) on reducing suffering: "\[t\]he suffering and slaughter of animals was the starting point for the creation of The Vegan Society."
1.3.7.2.2. Con: Not every vegan agrees. The American Vegan Society, for instance, believes becoming vegan involves "[discontinuing use of all animal products](http://www.americanvegan.org/howtobevegan.html)", which includes those that died naturally.
1.3.7.2.3. Con: This claim has faulty logic, as the Vegan Society's definition involves exploitation and cruelty, while this claim only talks about cruelty while neglecting the other parts of the definition.
1.3.7.2.4. Con: Looking at only the cruelty at the time of death does not compensate for the cruelty within an entire animal's life \(the end does not justify the means\). If this was the case, then milk would be an acceptable food if the cow died naturally.
1.3.7.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.3.7.4. Pro: Abstaining from all animal products sends the message that animal consumption is fundamentally unnecessary. If a vegan were to consume animals that died from natural causes it would be an implicit admission that a life without consuming animals is a worse life.
1.3.8. Con: The cutoff \(of what veganism is and is not\) might be definitive after all.
1.3.8.1. Pro: The cutoff could stop at the naturally-created molecular level for it to be vegan. An example is if an animal's products become molecular naturally \(like breathing out CO2\) and not an exploitative source \(like growing animals for CO2 production\) and becomes indistinguishable from the same molecules not from animals \(like CO2 from volcanoes\), it is vegan. If animal remains are intact \(like non-decomposed bones\), then those are not vegan.
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: This is a definition that is workable, as some animal-specific molecules are distinguishable from non-living sources, such as collagen. This means that a manufacturer cannot break down an animal into molecular components and call it vegan.
1.3.8.1.2. Con: The definition of intact vs. not intact remains is anthropocentric. Thus this prioritizes our own interests over the interests of animals, which is counter to the core tenets of veganism.
1.3.8.1.2.1. Pro: The distinction \(between intact/non-intact remains\) probably does not impact the quality of life of animals in general. Thus, humans should not make man-made decisions that would not happen in nature.
1.3.8.1.2.2. Con: There is no easy way of consulting animals before making decisions, so animals are not part of the decision-making process for humans \(with the exception of animals getting negatively impacted by such decisions\).
1.3.8.1.2.3. Con: There are difficulties in knowing the thoughts of animals, so it is faulty to make assumptions on them.
1.3.8.1.2.4. Con: Just because the definition is anthropocentric, does not mean we should not take it into consideration. To think about everything, veganism in general seems to be anthropocentric, as animals probably do not think about the animal they eat before they eat it.
1.3.8.1.2.5. Pro: These animals lived and died practically billions of years before any humans set foot on this planet, let come up with the idea of veganism. Thus, to those animals, their remains are questionable as to whether they are vegan or not.
1.3.8.1.2.5.1. Con: Just because an event happened before a definition came about, does not mean that the definition does not apply to the condition. If that were the case, then dinosaurs would not be reptiles, because that classification only existed from the [1730s](https://askabiologist.asu.edu/questions/birds-dinosaurs-reptiles), only after more reptiles emerged from them to connect the dots for scientists. Thus, believing dinosaurs are reptiles are relevant, even though there were no capabilities to really label them such when they were around.
1.3.8.1.2.5.2. Con: This type of circular thinking does not further the idea of whether people should go vegan or not, but only creates a logical dead-end. If humans make definitions for their use, there is no reason for humans not to use them.
1.3.8.2. Pro: Taxonomic classifications can help to determine whether a biological cell \(to eat\) is vegan or not.
1.3.8.2.1. Pro: If the cell comes from an animal source, it is not vegan.
1.3.8.2.1.1. Pro: [Eggs](http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-largest-biological-cell.htm) are a cell, but are not vegan because they are an animal product.
1.3.8.2.1.2. Pro: If the cell comes from an animal, like [cultured meat](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/08/06/article-2384715-1B298543000005DC-270_634x267.jpg), it is not vegan.
1.3.8.2.2. Pro: Determining cells individually is really helpful in the definition of veganism. This is helpful especially in difficult situations like [protist colonies](https://study.com/academy/lesson/colonial-protists-definition-examples.html) and [chromists](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/chromista/chromista.html). They do not seem vegan when just looking at them \(looks like one organism\). But, at the cellular level, they turn out to be vegan single-celled organisms after all.
1.3.8.2.2.1. Con: A cell that does not come from an animal source, like [spirulina \(a cyanobacteria\)](http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanolh.html), then it is [vegan](https://www.znaturalfoods.com/spirulina-organic-tablets).
1.3.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: Unicellular organisms are vegan.
1.3.9. Con: The definition used here is [pragmatic](http://www.flanderstoday.eu/living/vegan-visionary-preaches-pragmatism-instead-moralising), rather than dogmatic, and thus is actually easier to follow then other forms of veganism.
1.3.10. Con: [Veganism](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) is taken on an individual basis \("as far as possible and practicable"\) This premeditated flexibility makes Veganism feasible for most people and circumstances.
1.3.10.1. Pro: This flexibility of Veganism allows us to understand and practice it from different approaches. For instance, there's no moral inconsistency for a vegan to kill a mosquito, bugs, or exterminate pests, if they choose to do so in self-defense. Veganism is also practiced by some [Freegans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeganism#Veganism_and_food_waste) who don't eat animal products but may redistribute leftovers so the needlessly suffering of animals don't go to the trash. Or some may even make exceptions at invitations or gifts.
1.3.11. Pro: The obscuricity and extension of animal [by-product](http://roogirl.com/20-everyday-items-that-contain-animal-ingredients) usage makes it almost unreachable to actually realise "vegan purity".
1.3.12. Pro: A stated goal of veganism is to reduce animal suffering. However, "suffering" is too vaguely defined.
1.4. Pro: If all humans were vegan, animals would not be killed or made to suffer needlessly, which is the moral thing to do.
1.4.1. Pro: A vegan society would recognize that every animal has a right to live.
1.4.1.1. Con: A vegan society would need to choose if they prefer predators to live, and grow plant-eaters to feed them, or let predators starve \(or kill all predators\) to let plant-eaters live well. The same amount of animals would be killed in both options. The most humane way is to reduce predators to an amount that can sustain in small population, and kill plant-eaters in humane way \(and use them as food\) instead of allowing them to be a killed in an inhumane way by predators.
1.4.2. Con: Animals are killed in unhumanitary way by predators like lions, eagles and so on. Amount of Animals killed by humans are way smaller than "natural" biosystem do. Humans kill animals in humanitary way, fast kill, as little pain as it is possible. Predators often wound prey and let it die for hours or days to get an easy prey.
1.4.2.1. Con: Humans don't always kill in the most humane way possible. There are many examples of animals being killed in extremely inhumane ways, even when better alternatives are the norm.

[flanderstoday.eu](http://www.flanderstoday.eu/business/tielt-slaughterhouse-closed-after-graphic-video-footage-released)

[nltimes.nl](https://nltimes.nl/2018/06/20/animals-boiled-alive-dutch-slaughterhouses)
1.4.3. Con: Many animals are [killed in the production](https://www.morehouse.edu/facstaff/nnobis/papers/Davis-LeastHarm.htm) of plant-based food. Rabbits, mice, hamsters and other rodents, groundnesting birds, deer fawn, snakes, etc.
1.4.3.1. Con: It's true than many animals are killed in the production of plant-based food but not compared with the billions of lives that are sacrificed in the business of livestock. And if more investment in production of plant-based food could be made, allied to Cellular agriculture and the notion that animal life is as valuable, we as a global society would learn effective ways to produce animal products without slaughtering farmed livestock and sacrificing the animals that die in plant-based cultures.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: The production of plant-based food kills not only some animals, but often the plants themselves. The total number of lives lost through vegan agriculture is exponentially worse than the current number for animal agriculture once you consider all the plant lives that must be sacrificed.
1.4.3.2. Con: For raising animals, you need plants and while producing this you also kill the mice and snakes that live there.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Feeding animals and then eating those animals requires more crops than simply eating plants directly, which results in more mice, hares, snakes, insects etc. being killed.
1.4.3.3. Con: A balanced, responsible, ethical and sustainable agriculture where no animal is killed exists.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: Agriculture on the scale needed to feed entire countries is not possible without doing it in the open air, where any wild animal and countless insects can wander into the cultivated area and be effectively hidden and, subsequently, killed during the farming process. Indeed, pollination requires animals as part of the process.
1.4.3.3.2. Pro: If people grow crops indoors hydroponically or aeroponically plus vertically, then they can avoid killing most, if any, animals.
1.4.3.4. Con: Morally speaking, there is a huge difference between accidentally killing and killing on purpose. Not to mention the imprisonment, forced insemination, robbing their offspring, painfully living, etc, to which farm animals are submitted unlike collateral victims of agriculture.
1.4.3.5. Pro: Veganism [kills more animals](http://theconversation.com/ordering-the-vegetarian-meal-theres-more-animal-blood-on-your-hands-4659) than it saves.
1.4.3.6. Pro: Vegan agriculture most likely will not stop its heavy use of [pesticides, insecticides, and more animal-killing chemicals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2984095/), because they make vegan products viable for consumer markets.
1.4.3.6.1. Pro: As the [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2984095/) mentions, such pesticides cause more harm than the target pest, affecting other animals and possibly humans. This causes a lot of damage for animals that people do not even think of when envisioning vegan food.
1.4.3.6.2. Pro: Vegan food production, with these chemicals, may cause more net deaths to the ecosystem \(especially wildlife\) in an open loop compared to buying farmed natural predators \(like larger insects, such as praying mantises and ladybugs, to eat the smaller insects, like aphids\).
1.4.3.6.2.1. Pro: Buying farmed insects as natural pesticides decreases the death toll \(as insects cannot breed as easily\) as well as create a closed loop \(the insects eat other ones instead of just dying, so their bodily material goes back to the environment through the circle-of-life\).
1.4.3.7. Pro: The public will not likely see how their food is made, thus making regulation less likely upon the process than the final consumer product.
1.4.3.8. Pro: For a vegan diet more animals have to die than for a carnivore diet. Agriculture is by definition the killing of any living being on a piece of land to grow just one plant.
1.4.4. Con: In a vegan world, many animals that are currently farmed and subsequently eaten would either live in worse conditions or never get the chance to live at all. For a significant number of animals, a vegan world would be a worse outcome for them.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Some [forms of farming](https://foodanimalconcernstrust.org/what-is-a-humane-farm/) treat animals extremely well, euthanize painlessly and help them live longer and healthier lives than in nature. Humans actually help more than take by protecting, curing, feeding, nurturing, and prolonging them/their offspring's lives in exchange for meat that they won't need or use after their death.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: The fraction of the lifespan of farm animals compared to their maximum lifespan in captivity is much smaller than the lifespan of wild animals compared to their lifespan in captivity, e.g. the red deer lives 10 years in the wild and 20 in captivity [\(Red deer\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_deer), which result in a fraction of 0.5. For dairy cows this fraction is ~0.25 and for chickens raised for meat 0.02 \([hsi.org.au](https://hsi.org.au/go/to/70/farm-animal-welfare.html#.WtTolIhuaM8)\).
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: The second source \(the one about actual livestock animal\) is not a scientific peer reviewed research, but a simple infographics. Secondly, it talks about "expected" life expectancy \(meaning how long can the body hold ideally\), not the realistic one. Between sickness, predators, natural agents and all of the sorts, they would not realistically live as long. In nature being elder is rare, humanity is exceptional. Furthermore, most mammals live longer, [healthier, and less stressed](http://ecology.com/2011/10/20/bambi-bessie-wild-animals-happier/) in captivity.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Even though domesticated dogs do have a better life being cared for by humans than they would have as wolves in the wild, you wouldn't advocate killing dogs in their early adolescence to be eaten like cows or pigs are. Caring for an animal doesn't automatically make it morally permissible to kill it, it is perfectly possible and beneficial to both parties to let the animal live, as is the case with pets.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: Farming practices should not be described as "protecting" animals and "taking care of offspring" when it inevitably leads to the death of the animals and their offspring for the financial gain of the producer.
1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: Animals are protected and taken care, so those are the right terms to use, describing what is actually happening.
Death is inevitable anyway. Why should the meat go to waste?
1.4.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Breeding animals for the sole purpose of killing them is entirely avoidable. It's not like they just pop up out of nowhere, we're bringing them to this world in order to kill and eat them. This is not like making use of naturally occuring "meat sources" like roadkill.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: There's no such thing as ethical killing. If animals are taken care only for the purpose of killing them that is ethically wrong when there is an alternative.
1.4.4.1.4. Pro: The non-industrialized production and use of dairy products \(milk and eggs\) is not innately exploitative or unethical because domesticated animals do not suffer, but are are rather fed, nurtured, and protected by the humans that raise them in a mutually beneficial process.
1.4.4.1.4.1. Con: Just because it might be possible, in theory, to raise animals ethically, does not mean it is ethical to consume animal products right now, as we are far away from widespread implementation of these "humane" practices.
1.4.4.1.4.2. Con: If we swap the highly optimized conventional animal agriculture \(which relies on animals being treated like commodities in order to maximize profits\) for non-exploitative, "symbiotic" ways of raising and keeping animals, we would have to live on mostly vegan diets anyway, since these methods of obtaining animal products have much lower yields and take up even more resources.
1.4.4.1.5. Con: Even if a farmed animal is treated well, the amount of lives negatively impacted by its existence is still very high. Species who are going extinct because of deforestation to make room for farmland, animals killed in the harvesting of the many crops you need to feed a single animal. Even cats have become a burden on many ecosystems, threatening rodent and bird populations. You're exchanging one arguably good life for dozens of others.
1.4.4.1.6. Con: Caring for an animal and eating its flesh after it has died from natural causes would be ethical.
1.4.4.1.6.1. Pro: Since we actively kill the animals, animal agriculture is not kind or caring. You would not describe a person who breeds and raises dogs for food as an animal-loving person.
1.4.4.1.6.2. Pro: Since farmers take animals' lives well before their death, they take the animals' meat when they still need it \(rather than when they do not\). The statement about taking the meat when it is no longer needed by the animal is thus false.
1.4.4.1.7. Con: Humane farming is only marginally better than traditional animal agriculture, yet notoriously hard to implement because of backlash from the industry and consumers who fear rising prices.
1.4.4.2. Pro: All animals are eventually killed, whether by humans or other animals or nature. Meat producers [usually want](http://www.grass-fed-solutions.com/cattle-stress.html) animals to die quickly to prevent pain-associated chemicals from forming, as they spoil the meat. Thus, they use the most humane means possible.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: If comparing humane methods of dying to being eaten alive by a wolf or starving to death after you break your leg, or the other 1000 ways to die in the wild, eating farmed animals makes sense.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: A vegan society would be required to protect animals from harm from other animals.
1.4.4.2.2.1. Con: Humans are able to make moral decisions, animals aren't. That make us responsible of our own actions, but not for the actions of wild animals. We neither enforce other moral standards on animals \(e.g. We do not stop animals from raping each other, while it is illegal in most justice systems\).
1.4.4.2.2.2. Con: This is a slippery slope. The only moral obligation humans would have is to protect animals from other humans. Animals killing each other doesn't factor in this discussion.
1.4.4.2.2.3. Pro: It would not be consistent to expect humans to be vegan but leave the poor sheep to be slowly eaten alive by a wolf, or an omnivore animal \(like humans are\). We would eventually have to enforce "veganism" on all of the animal kingdom. What about carnivores in that case? This isn't a slippery slope, nor a reductio ad absurdum, it's consequence.
1.4.4.3. Pro: It's better for an animal to live a short life than no life at all, assuming any amount of life to be a net positive.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: A life in a factory farm is [worse](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/farm-animal-welfare) than no life at all.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: Factory farms are not the only farming practices which exist.
1.4.4.3.1.2. Pro: Factory farms make up a [majority](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/farm-animal-welfare) of the farming industry in the US and Canada.
1.4.4.3.1.3. Pro: The assumption of net positivity is really based on perspective. The net is positive for some, not for all. From the farmer's perspective, that short life might be worthwhile, whether for food, job, or increased quality-of-life from interacting with animals. However, the short life is not worthwhile for the animal who has a quality-of-life that people would never want.
1.4.4.3.1.4. Con: Vegans generally look at the net suffering, not existence versus non-existence. An animal that never gets to live cannot suffer; while an animal raised for food will experience a lot of suffering despite the small joy it might feel from being alive at all.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: A farmed animal is given life, allocated land resources and food resources to support it.
1.4.4.3.3. Pro: A farmed animal does not have to live in constant fear of predation as it does in the wild.
1.4.4.3.3.1. Pro: This is true, because farms try to remove that fear. The process involves coaxing farm animals to not worry or not showing them their death until the end, if at all \(leading the animals to believe that people are just raising and not killing them\).
1.4.4.3.3.1.1. Con: There is lots of footage around that demonstrates how the killing is not always clean and painless. Animals fighting back, animals being insufficiently stunned and noticing how they're being lowered into a scalding tub alive, pigs who are suffocated in CO2 chambers and go into panic as they realize they're not able to breathe. The methods are far from perfect.
1.4.4.3.3.2. Con: Farm animals do live in fear, they just have been bred to not react to their predation. Domestic animals have aggression and other genetic traits taken out of them to prevent them from struggle and fighting their predators \(a.k.a. humans\).
1.4.4.3.3.2.1. Con: While animals might not be aggressive towards humans, their reaction to the conditions of being raised and bred by humans is still aggression and nervousness. That's why chickens get their claws and beaks cut off, so they don't start attacking each other.
1.4.4.3.4. Pro: A farmed animal can be provided with a life that is worth living. Free-range farming with an enhanced environment to stimulate the animals is possible, so that the animals' life is worth living.
1.4.4.3.4.1. Con: We are in no position to decide whether an animal's life has been "good enough already" for it to be killed as we can't measure happiness. This highly subjective criteria of happiness is not sufficient for deciding when to end an animal's life until we have a better understanding of how and what animals feel.
1.4.4.3.4.1.1. Pro: We wouldn't kill a dog that had a happy childhood at two years of age just because that happiness ought to suffice for a lifetime. We instead try to maximize the amount of happy years our pets can spend on this planet. We don't do this with livestock, we set an arbitrary limit on how much happiness they deserve so that it fits our needs \(eating them\).
1.4.4.3.4.2. Con: If we allow animals to live long and fulfilled lives before eating them, raising and killing them for food would be a lot less economically feasible, leading to a major drop in the availability of animal products \(or extremely increased prices\), which would in turn lead to an almost-vegan diet anyways.
1.4.4.3.4.3. Con: Free-range is an [elastic term](https://youtu.be/NxvQPzrg2Wg?t=5m4s), meaning that the definition is arbitrary and can be changed. Likely free-range will not be [much better or more ethical](https://youtu.be/NxvQPzrg2Wg?t=5m4s) than conventional farming \(if we don't account for the environment\).
1.4.4.3.4.4. Con: From the animal's perspective, there is no purpose to their existence. Even if they had the cushiest, nicest life, it would not be worth living for them \(unless they want to be meat for people, which would only happen in rare instances\). The only value that the animal's life is worth living for is for humans \(like the farmer\). The farmer only thinks the life is valuable to an animal because of their anthropocentric, predatory-perspective biases.
1.4.4.3.4.4.1. Pro: Animals wanting to be meat goes against biology. Biologically, animals want to survive and reproduce, not be some predator's meal.
1.4.4.3.5. Con: This statement assumes that adding livestock is net positive life. However, in reality, it is not. Adding their lives come at the sacrifice of others \(namely wildlife and humans - due to climate change\). This makes adding farm life net negative when factoring in all variables.
1.4.4.3.5.1. Pro: Since there are people starving currently, it makes sense to help those who exist now instead of adding other mouths to feed that have yet to come into existence.
1.4.4.3.5.2. Pro: The breeds humans "created" are optimized for putting on weight quickly \(so much so that many of them have severe mobility issues\) and have many of their natural instincts removed. Most of them would not stand a chance in the wild so it would not make sense to keep them around if we decided not to eat meat anymore.
1.4.4.3.5.3. Pro: Because of this reality, we need to make sacrifices and value one life over another. If we choose farm animals, then we are creating net negative life for wildlife and people. Because of this net negativity, livestock should not be added to this world, just based on the numbers of life added to this world alone.
1.4.4.3.5.3.1. Pro: Humans and wildlife are better choices to keep than livestock.
1.4.4.3.5.4. Pro: With climate change, even if we keep adding animals to this world to increase the number of lives on Earth, the end would leave to a net life of 0. If temperatures go high enough, no animal, including the farm animals added, will survive. That is why adding livestock does not make sense now, and most definitely does not in the future.
1.4.4.3.6. Con: If the livestock do not take up land, then it would get filled by other lifeforms \(plants, fungi, wild animals, and maybe even humans\). One lifeform's loss is another one's gain. Thus the addition of livestock is net neutral at most, but most likely net negative.
1.4.4.3.6.1. Pro: Because nature does not like voids \(such as a lack of life\), we do not need to make effort to bring lives into the world \(as nature will take of that for us\).
1.4.4.3.6.1.1. Pro: Thus, it is a waste of resources to raise livestock just to keep them around when resources are not required to achieve the same effect.
1.4.4.3.6.1.2. Con: Nature is not concerned with the maximisation of positive conscious experience \(for humans and overall on Earth\), while raising animals could be considered a noble human endeavour \(by purposefully and artificially elevating total Earthly consciousness to a level that provides benefits\).
1.4.4.3.6.1.3. Con: There is arguably no such thing as "nature" which has any kind of intentions.
1.4.4.3.6.2. Pro: That short life is not worth the life lost on others affected by it. That means there is an overall net negative when factoring everyone in \(the life lost due to health conditions in humans and workers\).
1.4.4.3.6.3. Con: The opportunity for moral good is maximised where life with the emotional capacity for joy/pleasure/fulfillment is allowed to thrive. Livestock should therefore take priority over plant and fungal life.
1.4.4.3.6.3.1. Con: This would be valid if animal agriculture created joy and fulfillment, but it mainly creates suffering.
1.4.4.3.6.3.2. Con: Plants can have joy/pleasure/fulfillment when allowed to thrive too. We should not let our quest for 'emotional capacity' get in the way of giving as much life freedom and quality-of-life they deserve, no matter how they enjoy it. Instead we should embrace and bring life that comes our way into this world unbiased \(a.k.a. no priority\) if we can bring them happiness.
1.4.4.3.6.3.3. Con: Just because we do not know at this moment that plants do not have an emotional capacity for enjoyment, does not mean that such enjoyment does not exist within them. We just do not know about it. We should err on the side of caution \(instead of assuming they don't and be wrong\) until we know better \(research is still in its [infancy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/23/the-intelligent-plant) in the plant neurobiology field\).
1.4.4.3.6.4. Pro: An increasing world population increases our spatial demands, so cities and villages could also expand if less farmland was needed. This is especially true for regions which suffer from severe lack of affordable housing.
1.4.4.3.7. Con: Putting animals in a [catch-22](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catch-22), where they lose either way \(having no life, or have a bad life and dying early\) are equally terrible and not worth it. Neither are good options nor real choices, as the chance for a good life is too small. The best option is a good, long life with a natural, uninfluenced death if we choose to breed them, not a short life.
1.4.4.4. Con: Farmers tend to kill wildlife in order to protect their livestock
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: Vegans can care for animals in existence, like wildlife \(especially endangered species\), and allow them to live longer lives than before. People would just need to refocus their nurturing efforts on wildlife rather than farm animals.
1.4.4.4.2. Pro: Since farming negatively affects wildlife, it is better to be vegan to take care of the life already in existence \(aka wildlife\) than to create new life just to take care of at the cost of another.
1.4.4.5. Pro: Domesticated animals, livestock and other animals that depend on humans would starve to death.
1.4.4.5.1. Con: A cow's typical life-span is 25 years. Cows used in dairy production are [exhausted](http://www.ad-international.org/farm_animals/go.php?id=120) and for most part killed after 4-5 years.
1.4.4.5.2. Con: Animals can fend for themselves. Human existence occurred after the first animals.
1.4.4.5.3. Con: Most of the animals dependent on humans are in that situation because humans put them in it. When all humans will be vegan there won't be any more animals bred for farms. All animals dependent on humans should be prevented from breeding.
1.4.4.5.4. Con: This is simply untrue. The number of domesticated animals would gradually but drastically diminish \(probably of several orders of magnitude\) as the practice of forced, artificial reproduction would be dismissed; the remaining "domesticated" animals would be taken care of by their owners.
1.4.4.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.7.4.1.
1.4.4.5.6. Pro: Alternatively, if all humans became vegan, then all the animals on farms would be killed anyway as no-one is going to pay to look after them.
1.4.4.6. Con: Going out of the way to raise lifeforms \(in this case, farm animals\) should not take place, as it comes at the expense of other lifeforms \(that are more valuable to this world than farm animals\).
1.4.4.6.1. Pro: Much of wildlife live in worse conditions or never get the chance at all to live due to animal agriculture. Thus, giving farm animals a chance at life should not be a justification for them, when we sacrifice another's life to make their living possible.
1.4.4.6.1.1. Pro: Biodiversity loss is well documented and will only get worse as people eat more meat.
1.4.4.6.2. Pro: If we keep farm animals around, we live in worse conditions or not at all, because they contribute to climate change. Humans should not raise animals at the cost of human life.
1.4.4.6.2.1. Pro: Climate change due to eating meat will make it much more difficult for humans to live \(by lowering their carrying capacity\). Thus, raising animals to make their lives better is not a worthy endeavor.
1.4.4.6.3. Pro: Whether or not we raise animals, the total number of animals on Earth should remain about the same. The only difference is that the animals are a different species.
1.4.4.7. Con: If we raise farm animals, then we are messing with nature, as we are artificially breeding species that should not exist instead of letting evolution take place.
1.4.5. Pro: All humans should be vegan because it should reduce modern cannibalism \([1](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/587503/Cannibals-North-Korea-Kim-Jong-Un-map-Stefano-Brizzi-flakka-murder-crime-Breaking-Bad), [2](https://www.aol.com/article/2016/06/29/places-where-modern-day-cannibalism-still-exists/21421203/)\).
1.4.5.1. Con: Cannibalism isn't a widespread issue and it's not socially acceptable or legal as it is so any veganism would have absolutely no effect.
1.4.6. Con: Eating animals elevates their lives, which is a ['godly deed'](https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/2941/jewish/Meat.htm) in religion \(at least the Jewish one\). Not eating them is what truly causes them to suffer and is less moral, because then the animal cannot be elevated spiritually.
1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.1.15.5.
1.4.8. Con: The falling cost of [laboratory grown meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_agriculture) will make the choice to not eat animals easier.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Lab-grown meat also has a massively reduced environmental impact due to not needing to expend energy and water to grow an entire living animal, will be healthier to consume than natural meat because it will be grown in fully controlled conditions without toxins or need to give drugs to the animal, and due to it being more sustainable, it might actually be cheaper than natural meat.
1.4.8.2. Con: In vitro meat can be considered vegan as long as there is no exploitation or harm inflicted to animals.
1.4.8.2.1. Con: Right now, that is is not a reality. Lab-grown meat requires more animal products than a cell of an animal \(like [fetal bovine serum, or FBS](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2017/07/why_is_fetal_cow_blood_used_to_grow_fake_meat.html) and [collagen](https://sentientist.org/2013/08/05/will-in-vitro-meat-become-cruelty-free/)\). There is no alternative nor method in the near future where in-vitro meat will be vegan. Until then, we should try to avoid it.
1.4.8.2.1.1. Con: One day, lab-grown meat will find a replacement for these materials. Then it will live up to its potential and reputation of being more ethical than meat.
1.4.8.2.2. Con: People are vegan for ethical reasons, but people are also vegan for health reasons. Lab-grown meat does not address the health issues. It is still a net-positive \(environmental/ethical\) and while supported by vegans for that reason, it is still not, technically "vegan food".
1.4.8.2.2.1. Pro: When the age of mass produced lab grown meat arrives, then vegans will continue to avoid it because of the carcinogenic effects of [heme iron](http://cancerpreventionresearch.aacrjournals.org/content/4/2/177).
1.4.8.2.2.1.1. Con: There are other methods of avoiding mass produced lab grown meat contaminated with heme iron than simply choosing a vegan diet.
1.4.8.2.3. Con: Unless the stem cells used to grow the meat are routinely derived from some sort of self-replicating base and do not require continued exploitation of animals to acquire them, it cannot receive the full support of the vegan community.
1.4.8.2.4. Pro: In vitro meat requires less land use, water, and animal suffering. This would support the harm-reduction philosophy of veganism.
1.4.8.3. Con: In-vitro meat might bring back [cannibalism](http://listverse.com/2018/09/02/10-facts-about-human-cannibalism-from-modern-science/), because we would be able to grow human meat for consumption. Since many people are repulsed by cannibalism, it will make switching away from livestock to lab-grown meat hard.
1.4.8.4. Con: If we wait for this before making a change, many animals will suffer in that time.
1.4.8.4.1. Con: Veganism is a difficult lifestyle to realistically be adopted by the majority before the lab-grown meats take over, making the effort largely ineffectual at noticeably reducing violence overall. The effort and resources should instead be directed at the promotion of lab-grown meats.
1.4.8.5. Pro: This will require very little habit change for most people.
1.4.9. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.3.1.
1.4.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.5.4.
1.4.11. Pro: Animals have innate, individual rights, which are taken away when they are killed or made to suffer.
1.4.11.1. Pro: Animals have a desire to live.
1.4.11.1.1. Con: Something's desire to live does not imply its right to live. This is the cornerstone of Darwinian survival - everything wants to survive but only the fittest will.
1.4.11.2. Pro: Animals have the capacity to suffer.
1.4.11.2.1. Con: Undue suffering makes no economic sense. it is in a farmers interest to minimise stress.
1.4.11.2.2. Con: If cruelty/suffering is the argument, then acquiring meat from a hunter \(or similar instant killing method\) should be acceptable. In other words, you do not have to go vegan to avoid animal suffering - you just must be certain that your source of meat is cruelty-free.
1.4.11.2.2.1. Con: Killing an animal is not cruelty-free. The cruelty of killing extends to their family if they are part of raising it, as well as dying by having a short life and another being deciding their fate in life for them. Veganism does not create these abuses.
1.4.11.2.3. Pro: Animals are actually capable of suffering, and are aware and articulated about that. This is now beyond scientific debate. The most simple argument to prove this is to consider that suffering would not have any [evolutionary value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4SnBCPzBl0&feature=youtu.be) if it were not perceived and felt in animals similarly to how it is perceived and felt in humans.
1.4.11.2.4. Pro: Some people believe animals see themselves as unique individuals.
1.4.11.2.4.1. Con: Some people do not agree that animals see themselves as unique individuals.
1.4.11.2.4.2. Con: Many animals [do not pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test) the mirror test as a measure of self awareness.
1.4.11.2.4.2.1. Con: The mirror test is likely a [very unreliable](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/02/what-do-animals-see-in-the-mirror/516348/) test of self awareness.
1.4.11.2.4.3. Con: This is an unsupported claim. "Seeing oneself as a unique individual" is vaguely defined and the fact that animals do so must be proved.
1.4.11.2.4.3.1. Pro: The opinions of some people should not be treated as a fact or a reason to ban everyone from eating meat.
1.4.11.2.4.3.2. Con: [Many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_fish#Experiencing_pain) [animals](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/expanim/62/2/62_12-0070/_article) were thought to not feel or be able to experience pain in the past, where we now know they can. It is better to err on the side of safety in this matter. It may be a bit off topic, but it was believed deep into the 80s and 90s that human babies can't feel pain either. This is another example of how it's better to err on the safe side.
1.4.11.2.5. Pro: We should assume that animals are conscious.
1.4.11.2.5.1. Pro: When we compare the human reactions signalling pain to reactions often [expressed by animals](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/do-animals-feel-pain-in-the-same-way-as-humans-do-10371800.html) when they possibly would feel pain, they are very similar.
1.4.11.2.5.2. Pro: Consciousness is a [barely understood](https://www.newscientist.com/round-up/consciousness/) concept, even in humans, but this does not mean there is no consciousness. Humans act on the assumption consciousness exists for themselves and others.
1.4.11.2.5.3. Con: We can also assume that farmed animals have no concept of life outside the farm, and since they've never experienced anything but farm life, they would have no reason not to be happy with life on the farm.
1.4.11.2.6. Con: Animals do not have souls and so do not perceive anything. Many credible thinkers have believed animals to be [automatons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_machine).
1.4.11.2.7. Con: Captive animals only suffer when they are aware of their wild counterparts.
1.4.11.3. Con: A vegan society would equate humans rights with animal rights, which would make society worse off overall.
1.4.11.3.1. Con: Veganism claims to be willing to grant more rights to non human animals than the rights they are currently acknowledged. This does not mean to equate human rights to animal rights. Vegans do recognize the specificity of the human species.
1.4.11.3.1.1. Pro: Humans are the only species capable of ethics \(which is why it is irrelevant for veganism that wild animals predate on each other\).
1.4.11.3.1.2. Pro: Humans are the only species capable of politics \(which is why no mentally healthy vegan ever asked for animals to have the right to vote!\).
1.4.11.3.2. Con: A vegan world would simply mean that animals are worth more than to be killed for taste.
1.4.11.3.3. Pro: When we elevate the rights of animals with respect to human rights we are also by corollary demoting human rights with respect to those of animals.
1.4.11.3.3.1. Con: This argument uses a measure of relative respect of humans and animals. It is similar to the statement "When we clean tables we are also by corollary demoting the cleanliness of human teeth with respect to tables". While the intended point may or may not be valid, the argument is not.
1.4.11.4. Con: Animals have no liberty.
1.4.11.4.1. Con: Animals have a concept of what it's like to be free vs being held in captivity.
1.4.11.5. Pro: We wouldn't like to be enslaved or killed by a more advanced alien civilization or a much more biologically complex alien species. So we shouldn't do this to animals.
1.4.11.5.1. Con: It is not the fact that humans are more advanced than animals, but the fact that humans are capable of rational thought and moral behavior while animals are not that is important.
1.4.11.6. Con: If animals have individual rights they should not be enslaved, which means pets would have to be abolished.
1.4.11.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.2.4.
1.4.11.8. Con: It is immoral to equate "animal rights" with human rights.
1.4.11.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.15.5.4.
1.4.11.8.2. Con: The distinction between humans and animals from the [biological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_psychopathology) and [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness) perspective is small.
1.4.11.8.3. Pro: Animals cannot have the same rights as humans since that will cause you to be sentenced for involuntary manslaughter when accidentally stepping on an ant.
1.4.11.8.3.1. Con: Ants are insignificant and value-less in comparison to a e.g. cow. Therefore humans should go vegan in order to protect cows and similar larger animals from being slaughtered, while there is no need to have focus on smaller creatures such as insects
1.4.11.8.3.1.1. Con: An animal's 'value' should not be based on size, but on its ability to suffer.
1.4.11.8.3.2. Con: That is an '[Appeal to consequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences)' fallacy.
1.4.11.9. Con: To be legitimate, rights should be based on a real understanding of the thing to which they are given. Since many humans cannot empathise with animals, it cannot be said that they have rights.
1.4.11.9.1. Con: Many humans also cannot empathise with other humans, which does in no way mean that some humans dont deserve rights.
1.4.12. Con: Animals dominating other animals is natural, thus humans using animals to their own ends is not unethical.
1.4.12.1. Pro: Animals such as cats and dolphins hunt and torture their prey for sport.
1.4.12.1.1. Con: Veganism is a statement of ethical nature, and humans are the only species capable of ethics and of the notion of morality. It is therefore irrelevant to veganism that non-human animals display traits of cruel behaviour towards other animals.
1.4.12.2. Pro: Animals would still be killed by other animals.
1.4.12.2.1. Con: Only to survive, not as much as we kill animals.
1.4.12.2.1.1. Pro: This is more natural in comparison with intensive factory farming and slaughter.
1.4.12.2.2. Con: The fact that people are still raped and murdered in Syria doesn't relieve us of the ethical obligation to not rape and kill.
1.4.12.2.3. Con: Veganism is an ethical statement, and ethics only apply to humans \(as they are the only species capable of the very notion of ethics\). Veganism does not apply to animals, and the fact that wild animals would keep on predating is therefore irrelevant.
1.4.12.3. Con: Nearly all widely held principles of ethics diverge from what happens in the natural, animal world.
1.4.12.4. Con: Simply because an authority such as nature does some action that does not make the action morally correct.
1.4.12.5. Con: Humans, unlike other animals, do not need to harm animals to live and thrive, which makes it unethical.
1.4.13. Con: Vegan morality is inconsistent and hypocritical in valuing one life \(animals\) over another \(plants, fungi, and microbes\).
1.4.13.1. Con: Plants are not the same as humans, as they are autotrophs, and thus do not require the destruction of life in their consumption practices \(unless it's a carnivorous exception\).
1.4.13.2. Con: Beyond a vegan diet, a non-living diet is more ethical yet \(in terms of not harming life\).
1.4.13.2.1. Pro: Humans can lower this capability by eating lower on the food chain \(like not eating animals that ate other animals before a human eats it\).
1.4.13.2.2. Pro: People could source their diet more from nonliving sources, like rocks \(salt, clay, baking soda, [mineral supplements](http://www.doctorsresearch.com/articles3.html)\), water, and sunlight \(Vitamin D\).
1.4.13.2.2.1. Pro: Even though these sources have no calories, people could get nutrients from these sources instead of going to living sources for the nutrients these contain.
1.4.13.2.2.2. Con: These have no calories, so people cannot sustain themselves solely on them.
1.4.13.2.3. Pro: People have the technological capabilities to [create food from chemicals](http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/articles/2516259/evonik-siemens-to-make-chemicals-from-co2-eco-electricity) \(through electrolysis\), so in the future, they may not require life to survive.
1.4.13.2.3.1. Pro: Another option might be [artificial photosynthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2lPQWL3o0U), such as making [glucose](https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0310).
1.4.13.2.3.2. Pro: Chemical reactions are possible to make essential amino acids from nonliving sources \(like [methionine](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jf60172a033) and [cysteine](https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/Amino%20Acid%203%20TR.pdf)\).
1.4.13.2.3.3. Con: Some people worry about the health issues associated with consuming the materials used \(like metals\) to make the food.
1.4.13.3. Pro: Valuing animals above plants depends on their similarity to us and is therefore based on an anthropocentric bias. This defeats the implicit aim of veganism by assuming that humans are superior, which gives us reign to harm non-humans for our own benefit. A less anthropocentric veganism would value all life in parallel to human and animal life, rendering all human behaviour immoral by virtue of the way in which we treat bacteria, plants etc. in order to sustain ourselves.
1.4.13.3.1. Con: The different treatment of different beings can be explained by the level of harm that can be done to that being. Sentient beings can suffer more than non-sentient beings, because they can experience pain and certain emotions \([Dawkins, 2000](https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/40/6/883/187667)\).
1.4.13.3.1.1. Con: Certain simpler forms of fauna \(including many species of insects, [fish](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/faf.12010) and invertebrates\) cannot consciously experience pain, but merely a reflexive response to physical damage that they don't have the cognitive ability to perceive as distressful. By this definition of non-violence, an ethical omnivorous diet can still rely on consumption of such animals that cannot consciously feel pain or distress.
1.4.13.3.1.1.1. Con: "Only very recently have neuroanatomical studies revealed that teleost fish possess similar pain-processing receptors to higher vertebrates. Research has also shown that fish neurophysiology and behaviour are altered in response to noxious stimulation. . . . .  Whilst we agree with the author that fish are unlikely to perceive pain in the same way that humans do, we believe that currently available evidence indicates that fish have the capacity for pain perception and suffering."[Braithwaite2004](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ufaw/aw/2004/00000013/A00101s1/art00012).
1.4.13.3.1.2. Con: Our understanding of "suffering" is also informed by how similar something is to us - the more similar to us, the more likely we are to recognize suffering when we see it. Morally consistent veganism must assume that a life can suffer whether we recognize the form of that suffering or not. As it is impossible to prove a negative, i.e. that plants *don't* suffer, then we cannot assume we have the ability to effectively limit harm.
1.4.13.3.2. Con: Vegans avoid eating sentient beings. Eating some life, like plants, is necessary as it is not possible to create a complete nutritional menu from inanimate sources without the inclusion of some kind of life form.
1.4.13.3.3. Con: Meat industry "kills" more plants than if people were to all go vegans. See [Sustainability of meat-based and plant-based diets and the environment](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/78/3/660S/4690010), [Protein efficiency per unit energy and per unit greenhouse gas emissions: Potential contribution of diet choices to climate change mitigation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030691921100090X) and [Sustainability of plant-based diets: back to the future](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/100/suppl_1/476S/4576675?searchresult=1#110601922) for details.
1.4.13.3.4. Con: While it is true that we tend to value more what is perceived as more evolved, and more [similar to us](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/3336375/We-prefer-people-we-think-are-similar-to-ourselves.html). This claim seems to assume that anthropocentrism is antonym to veganism, which is not, [veganism is](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) just and only against explotation and cruelty towards animals, not against the evolution theory, biological categorizations or other scientific findings. Also seems to confuse Veganism with [Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism) which would fit as a "less anthropocentric veganism".
1.4.13.4. Con: This should be framed relative to the cruelty of raising and harvesting plants for food. While plants do not \(that we know of\) perform central pain processing, they are still responsive to nociception in ways that reflect aversion, and often die due to our use of their bodies. We consider animal pain more important only because of their proximity to our lived experience - an anthropocentric bias.
1.4.13.4.1. Pro: Help has to go where is most needed. The pain and suffering caused by animal explotation, qualitatively and quantitatively, is nowhere near that of plants, fungis and microbes. [Animal Slaughter Kill Counter](http://thevegancalculator.com/animal-slaughter/)
1.4.13.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.3.
1.4.13.4.3. Con: Plants lack a central nervous system, and a brain to register the experience, and thus true awareness or sentience. The 'pain' response of plants could be equated to an autonomic response to stimuli. Suffering does not occur in the limbs, even if they are cut. [Suffering occurs, and is translated into suffering, in the brain](https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-pain-and-what-is-happening-when-we-feel-it-49040).
1.4.13.4.4. Con: This claim is actually support for the vegan position. [Since raising animals requires killing more plants](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/05/vast-animal-feed-crops-meat-needs-destroying-planet) than if we ate them ourselves, reducing our animal use would necessarily lead to a significant reduction in the killing of plants, too.
1.4.13.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.15.5.4.2.
1.4.13.5. Con: An "all or nothing" approach [is logically fallacious](http://www.academia.edu/21565174/Fallacy_All_or_Nothing) and hinders progression in the field of animal rights and ethics. Nowadays, social and political change is achieved through reforms, not revolutions. This means we don't need to have everything figured out before we can start working on improving and protecting animals' lives.
1.4.13.6. Con: Whether or not plants feel pain, veganism results in fewer plant deaths as fewer plant calories are used as animal feed.
1.4.13.6.1. Pro: Animals consume more plants to produce x amount of calories than if we got the calories directly from plants. Therefore even if eating plants is removing life, less plants are consumed by only eating plants.
1.4.13.7. Pro: Studies around plants' feelings and senses, and our [understanding of such topics is extremely limited](http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/features/062208/do-plants-have-brains); and our current point of view seems to be based on the complexity \([1](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/plants-use-neurotransmitter-signal-stress/), [2](https://www.crcpress.com/Neurotransmitters-in-Plant-Life/Roshchina/p/book/9781578081424), [3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-28516-8_10)\) or non-existence of a typical nervous system despite there still being stimuli in plants.
1.4.13.7.1. Con: There is no moral equivalence between the harm of killing an animal with a nervous system, which is capable of feeling pain and fear, and eating celery.
1.4.13.8. Pro: Life eats life, it is only natural for humans to eat animals, everything dies and their death is part of life.
1.4.13.8.1. Con: That would make sense if one life is taken for another life, in which case it would not matter as much if it's a plant, animal, microbe...However, when [animals are raised, more life dies than crops](https://vegeteers.com/2014/03/29/how-many-animals/). That is why this claim is invalid, because eating meat is numerically worse than eating plants.
1.4.13.8.1.1. Pro: Only an equivalent of lives lost from eating animals would make sense here. However, since another alternative \(plants\) beats that, then we need to make choices.
1.4.14. Pro: Meat production is very often cruel.
1.4.14.1. Con: Farmed livestock are protected from threats such as exposure, starvation, disease and predators. Protections that they would not have in the wild.
1.4.14.2. Con: -> See 1.4.11.2.2.
1.4.14.3. Pro: Safety standards in the meat industry are particularly low. The [meatpacking industry](https://www.hrw.org/news/2005/01/24/abuses-against-workers-taint-us-meat-and-poultry) is particularly dangerous.
1.4.14.3.1. Con: Safety standards can be raised and enforced. Banning something outright because the standards are currently lax is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
1.4.14.3.2. Con: [Safety standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_food_safety_organisations) differ between countries, some may be better than the United States \(which the article above discusses\).
1.4.14.3.3. Pro: Even though the numbers are low, meatpacking is still a pretty dangerous industry due to [under-reporting](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meat-and-poultry-work-is-dangerous-but-not-all-injuries-counted/).
1.4.14.4. Pro: In the eyes of [Paul McCartney: "If slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be a vegetarian.”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/44596-if-slaughterhouses-had-glass-walls-everyone-would-be-a-vegetarian)
1.4.14.4.1. Pro: [Cowspiracy](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/01/vegans-are-coming-millennials-health-climate-change-animal-welfare), which shows what happens in slaughterhouses, helped popularize and increase veganism.
1.4.14.4.2. Con: I have been working at an animal farm, and didn't become a vegetarian.
1.4.14.5. Con: Many meat animals in the third world are part of the family and protected from surrounding predators and only killed when there is need. Animals can be killed individually with minimum pain.
1.4.14.6. Pro: This cruelty reflects poorly on humanity \(like treating animals poorly is part of what encompasses being a human is\). We should not represent this cruelty and should avoid it to not be associated with it.
1.4.14.6.1. Pro: Cruelty should not be on a meal plate or part of keeping us alive.
1.4.14.6.2. Pro: Meat production is [barbaric](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34541077) in its cruelty. We live in the 21st century and should not have such uncivilized tendencies in society today.
1.4.14.7. Pro: [PTSD](https://www.texasobserver.org/ptsd-in-the-slaughterhouse/) is very widespread in slaughterhouses.
1.4.14.7.1. Con: It is possible to eat meat that does not come from a slaughterhouse.
1.4.14.7.1.1. Con: If you're talking about 'free to roam' 'organic' "happy" animals, then space would be an issue. We're [already using](http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/ar591e/ar591e.pdf) about 30% of the earth's landmass for animal agriculture, and most meat comes from tightly packed, super efficient slaughterhouses. If everyone ate 'ethical meat' it'd have to be grown on the moon.
1.4.14.7.1.2. Con: This is a small proportion of the meat consumed.
1.4.14.7.1.3. Con: It is difficult for most people to know how or where their meat was slaughtered.
1.4.14.7.1.3.1. Con: They should make more effort to find out.
1.4.14.7.2. Con: This is a systemic problem that, while heavily linked to the current system of animal agriculture, is not an inherent part of it.
1.4.14.7.2.1. Con: Reducing demand for meat will, in the long run, lead to fewer slaughterhouses and less trauma for the workers, whether or not slaughterhouses are a truly necessary part of the system.
1.4.14.7.3. Pro: Towns hosting slaughterhouses have [higher](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2010/05/14/probing_the_link_between_slaughterhouses_and_violent_crime.html) [criminality rates](http://www.animalstudies.msu.edu/Slaughterhouses_and_Increased_Crime_Rates.pdf). [And](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15685306-12341284)  " ...workers exposed to the killing of large numbers of animals on a regular basis become disturbed and appear to lose empathy."
1.4.14.8. Pro: Animals would not live in captivity or under unappropriate conditions.
1.4.14.8.1. Pro: Animals at farms are treated with the lowest priority when it comes to keeping lives safe during natural disasters. With [Hurricane Florence](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/hurricane-florence-millions-animals-condemned-drown-factory-farms/), millions of animals died in factory farms.
1.4.14.8.2. Con: -> See 1.4.11.6.
1.4.15. Con: Morality is subjective.
1.4.15.1. Pro: Morality can be measured in relation to anything a person decides to base their morality on. As such it is subjective.
1.4.15.2. Con: Immanuel Kant's [1st categorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative) imperative \(morality base\): would it be good if this action were applied to all within the class of things? If we don't think a pet deserves to die \(animal\), then any other animal doesn't deserve to die.
1.4.15.2.1. Con: A pet is an animal to which a person assigns value.
You don't want your pet killed, has you don't want your car destroyed. That doesn't mean we shouldn't destroy any car.
1.4.15.2.2. Con: Kant's moral imperative is a flawed one. There are many things that can be applied to all within the class of things that would have vastly destructive results if applied so, yet these things are not necessarily immoral. For example, homosexuality would be destructive if applied to the entirety of the human race yet it's not inherently immoral or harmful.
1.4.15.2.3. Con: Many omnivorous humans don't have the cognitive dissonance that makes them treat pets and farm animals differently. Pigs can be just as great pets and companions as they are a great food source, and horses can be a food source as great as they are companions. Pets are not usually eaten because of an emotional bond with the owner, not because their entire species is considered more undeserving of violence compared to others.
1.4.15.3. Con: This does not mean that morality is arbitrary: even in the most relativistic of all the possible ethical frameworks, consensus can be achieved on basic norms such as "unnecessarily harming of sentient beings is morally wrong" \(which is actually already a largely shared view point across vastly different cultures\).
1.4.15.4. Pro: The ethics of eating meat is highly subjective.
1.4.15.5. Con: [Morality is objective.](https://www.kialo.com/morality-is-objective-2649/2649.0=2649.1/=2649.1)
1.4.15.6. Pro: What is moral relates to consensus.
1.4.16. Pro: Because humans can thrive on a well planned vegan diet, there is no necessity for eating animal products. Lack of necessity makes the animal exploitation unethical.
1.4.16.1. Con: What is unethical according to one culture, can be ethical according to another. There is no such a thing as a "right decision" in this question what is fits for all. For example, Christianity teaches that God allowed mankind to eat animals, and there are even Biblical verses, when God suggest to eat animals. Therefore, for a confessional Christian, eating animals is completely ethical.
1.4.16.2. Con: If everybody went vegan there would not be enough food for everybody or we would have to exploit soil, which would lead a mass extinction and starvation pretty soon. Eating meat is necessary for survival for a lot of people and countries.
1.4.16.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.19.
1.4.17. Pro: When most humans eat animals they do not consider the death that was required for their meal. If people had to consider the actual consequences of their diet far more would be vegan.
1.4.17.1. Con: This claim makes an assumption that is certainly false as many people eat the animals they themselves kill.
1.4.17.1.1. Con: Only 35% of hunters consider meat being the \(main?\) reason for hunting according to [Responsive Management](http://www.responsivemanagement.com/index.php) \(["Motivations behind hunting"](https://www.fieldandstream.com/sites/fieldandstream.com/files/styles/655_1x_/public/import/2014/import/BlogPost/embed/meatstudy.JPG?itok=aCZxl-DC)\)
1.4.17.1.2. Con: Proportionnally speaking, this is not valuable. All people are not killers because some love to kill other humans.
1.4.17.2. Con: In a modern society there are many jobs that some find distasteful, while animal butchery is one, so for example are sewage processing and construction of high-rise buildings, both jobs others would likely not dare to perform.  If this argument has merit, it should apply to all fields of human endeavor which would have disastrous effects to human civilization.
1.4.17.3. Pro: Many people try not to think about what happened before eating their meal, partially because they do not want to consider the consequences. If those people were forced to see the process \(without blocking the thoughts in their mind\), they probably would eat less meat.
1.4.17.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.4.
1.4.17.5. Con: Given the choice of starving or killing an animal, ALL people would kill.  There are only a few traits that a species must possess, but self preservation is one of them.  Humans are just another type of animal, like wolves, or lions.  No one has a problem with them killing herbivores to feed their young.
1.4.17.5.1. Con: This is true in a survival context. Which is not the case anymore for the majority of humanity.
1.5. Pro: A world of veganism would be a more ethical world: this would bring moral benefits to human society.
1.5.1. Con: Following the ethical logic of veganism creates a high moral standard that humans would struggle to adapt to.
1.5.1.1. Pro: A vegan world is not possible. Vegan food is sometimes prepared using indirectly animal-derived products. Even if all products are animal-free, they might be produced using other tools that derive from animals and so on. You are never 100% vegan. Even just by living in this society, using its benefits, you are living off the usage of animals. The only way to be totally free is to live in nature.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: The [definition](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) of "Veganism" in the Vegan Society page is: "Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose." In the circumstances described, it would certainly be impossible and impracticable to avoid animal products. Eating animal products in such circumstances is therefore not in conflict with the definition of veganism.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: The point of veganism is to reduce the amount of contribution to unnecessary suffering and death of animals, when there are many similar alternatives that constitute a healthier diet.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: Many [non-food](https://www.treehugger.com/green-food/9-everyday-products-you-didnt-know-had-animal-ingredients.html) [products](http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/06/07/8-items-animal-byproducts/) [rely](https://www.peta.org/living/food/animal-ingredients-list/) on [animal](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/15-surprising-things-that-contain-animal-products-2014-3) [products](http://roogirl.com/20-everyday-items-that-contain-animal-ingredients/) in their production chain. We do not live in a Star-Trek world where complex organic chemicals can simply be synthesized.
1.5.1.1.3.1. Con: The production of complex chemicals is work in process, but is certainly possible with genetically manipulated bacteria and yeasts. E.g. [insulin](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/fromdnatobeer/exhibition-interactive/recombinant-DNA/recombinant-dna-technology-alternative.html); and even [milk](https://qz.com/1161955/perfect-day-is-making-convincing-cow-free-milk-by-genetically-engineering-yeast/).
1.5.1.1.3.2. Con: We could research substitutes to these products, currently, for some of these cases, substitutes exist but we simply don't use them as they're more expensive.
1.5.1.1.4. Pro: There is no such thing as ["vegan"](https://www.kialo.com/there-is-no-such-thing-as-vegan-10281/10281.0=10281.1).
1.5.2. Con: Veganism is not as ethical as other lifestyles.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Veganism accepts valuing humans/animals over other lifeforms, which is almost as bad as omnivores accepting valuing humans over animal/other lifeforms.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.13.3.
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Vegans' morality/ethics is always linked to animals we have empathy with, where we recognize ourselves as similar in the line of evolution, like mammals, fishes, birds, etc. It is acceptable to kill other kinds of life like non-pathogenic microbes or even vegetables, when no empathic sense is developed. Then, moral discourse just protects part of life, not life itself.
1.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: Veganism is based on the false superiority of animals against plants, while we already know about plant life \(like Pando\) that is much more complex than sponges \(animals\). It doesn't make sense for Pando to be considered 'just' food and sponge considered comparatively sacred.
1.5.2.1.3. Pro: Veganism's morality is detrimental and exploitative to lifeforms outside of animals.
1.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: Killing wild plants affects entire ecosystems \(including wildlife and native cultures\), especially to the point that a major food source goes away. An example of this is cutting down trees that take a long time if ever to bear fruit if replanted \(such as [acorn trees in a drought-prone environment](https://www.kcet.org/shows/tending-the-wild/episodes/tending-the-wild)\).
1.5.2.1.3.2. Pro: Many plant species go extinct or endangered due to exploiting plants, especially in the essential oil industry with rare plants like [sandalwood](http://www.tambela.com/articles/sandalwood.php).
1.5.2.1.3.3. Pro: This impacts all life on Earth. For example, if a plant is not preserved in the Amazon due to deforestation for a crop, that plant cannot be examined to find it to be a[pharmaceutical breakthrough](http://rain-tree.com/) for a major disease.
1.5.2.1.3.3.1. Con: The largest cause of deforestation is clearing land for livestock and to produce the food to feed livestock.
1.5.2.1.3.4. Pro: Vegan ethics provide no protection for organisms outside the animal kingdom, such as unicellular and non-animal multi-cellular organisms.
1.5.2.1.3.4.1. Con: Non vegan ethics also provides no protection for organisms outside the animal kingdom.
1.5.2.1.3.4.2. Con: Unlike animals unicellular organisms do not have a central nervous system and cannot feel pain or suffering.
1.5.2.1.3.5. Con: Giving animals moral consideration is still better than not respecting the needs of other living beings at all. No one said veganism was the end all be all, we will still need to adapt and evolve our ethics continuously as science gives us more insight on what it means to be alive and sentient.
1.5.2.1.3.6. Con: "Murdering" a carrot and murdering a dog are different acts. The argument that these are morally different hinges on sentience. It's the same reason turning off the life support machine sustaining a brain-dead patient is considered more acceptable than not treating a mentally alive person who would otherwise die from an illness. A body without consciousness doesn't care about what is done to it and has no sense of itself to lose, so its moral claim can't be equated with a sentient life's claim.
1.5.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.13.
1.5.2.1.5. Con: Animals are not held under the same moral standards as human beings when it comes to moral culpability. Thus, animals get more leeway \(i.e. less restrictions\) in living their life, which values them over humans \(just like, as an analogy, royalty get more privileges in leading their life than those below them in a feudalistic society\).
1.5.2.2. Pro: Some diets are more ethical than veganism
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: A raw vegan is more ethical than a vegan one.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: Raw vegan diets are better for the environment.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Cooking creates air pollution, by releasing pollutants into the air, which are bad for the environment, such as [VOCs and CO2](http://www.organicauthority.com/gas-or-charcoal-grilling-which-barbecue-is-better-for-the-environment/).
1.5.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Raw vegan diets use less resources to eat food, as cooking requires resources \(like kitchen equipment, stoves, fuel/electricity...\).
1.5.2.2.1.2. Pro: Raw vegan diets are better for personal health and safety.
1.5.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Cooked food creates cancer-causing chemicals, such as [acrylamide](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-fried-foods-are-bad#section4),[HCAs, PAHs, and AGEs](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/all-about-cooking-carcinogens).
1.5.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: Not cooking is safer and less destructive than cooking, especially when thinking of [cooking fires](https://www.nfpa.org/public-education/by-topic/top-causes-of-fire/cooking).
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: One diet that's more ethical to life than veganism is [Jain](https://pinkispalate.com/jainism/jain-diet/) [veganism](http://clovegarden.com/diet/jain.html). This diet tries to extend non-violence beyond animals to microorganisms and [plants](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/amy-shah/jain-food-struggles-in-am_b_8961854.html).
1.5.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.13.2.
1.5.2.2.4. Pro: A vegan [freegan](https://freegan.info/) diet may be more ethical than veganism.
1.5.2.2.4.1. Pro: [Freegan](https://freegan.info/) diets are better for the environment
1.5.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: [Freegans](https://freegan.info/) use less resources for their food, because they are eating food that would go to waste, instead of food that is grown for their purposes.
1.5.2.2.4.1.2. Pro: They reduce food and other, general waste through repurposing.
1.5.2.2.4.2. Pro: Vegan [freegan](https://freegan.info/) diets sometimes try to advocate for social issues \(boycotting the economical system\) on top of animal/environmental ones, while veganism focuses mostly on animal/environmental ones.
1.5.2.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.7.7.3.
1.5.2.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.11.
1.5.2.3. Pro: There are some lifestyles that may be better than veganism.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: [Freegans](https://www.happycow.net/blog/veganism-vs-freeganism/) \(the vegan ones\) might be more ethical than regular vegans, due to their negative waste habits.
1.5.2.3.2. Pro: Being an [environmentally-conscious](https://www.happycow.net/blog/have-you-greened-your-diet-yet/) vegan \(eco-vegan\) is more ethical to the [environment](https://www.happycow.net/vegtopics/environment) than just being vegan.
1.5.2.4. Con: Lifestyles with a lot of focus in purity \(such as [Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism), [Straight Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_edge), [Raw-Veganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_veganism) or [Breatharianism](https://raymaor.com/breatharian-life-faq/)\) may never be mainstream, because "mainstream" by definition -in our culture- [appeals to the lowest common denominator](https://www.theonion.com/lowest-common-denominator-continues-to-plummet-1819566022), in order to reach [the most people possible](https://www.rapidtvnews.com/201011038613/ccr-forces-itv-to-chase-lowest-common-denominator-audiences.html#axzz5QDdSGIHA) without any scope at all.
1.5.3. Pro: When people become vegan, they often keep up with their decision to do so for a greater amount of time if they are influenced and motivated for a wide [variety of reasons](https://faunalytics.org/how-many-former-vegetarians-and-vegans-are-there/), and as such they consider their impact upon environmentalism, ethic, health, peace, equality, water, oceans and their quality, wildlife and so on. This makes people more thoughtful and thus more likely to make other ethical decisions.
[Don't hesitate and try more plant based foods and reduce animal products in your daily habits](https://veganuary.com/why/)
1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.2.
1.5.5. Pro: If humanity turned vegan or vegetarian world hunger could be [eradicated](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034015/meta).
1.5.5.1. Pro: Plant foods spoil a low more slowly than animal products and many don't even require refrigeration. Freezing and canning vegetables further increases their shelf life. This means food waste from spoilage could be greatly reduced.
1.5.6. Con: Vegan food production is unethical for workers.
1.5.6.1. Pro: One example is handling [cashews](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11577928/Blood-cashews-the-toxic-truth-about-your-favourite-nut.html), due to their toxins.
1.5.6.2. Pro: [70%](http://www.fao.org/rural-employment/resources/detail/en/c/1073931/) of child labor is in agriculture.
1.5.6.2.1. Con: This is not inherently an agriculture-related problem. Child labor disappears when poverty disappears and when there are alternatives \(like education\). Taking away the employment will only make things worse.
1.5.6.3. Pro: Many popular vegan crops are picked by migrant farmers that face sexual, verbal, and physical abuse, as well as low pay. The production of vegan products is also not “cruelty free".
1.5.6.3.1. Con: Most crops \(especially in richer areas on the globe\) are produced for animal feed \([sos.noaa.gov](https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/agriculture-food-vs-feed/)\). Changing to a plant-based diet would mean that less farmers would be needed to produce crops, thus less farmers needs to be checked on employer welfare standards with the same amount of resources.
1.5.6.3.2. Con: There are no exclusively vegan crops. Food and products consumed by vegans are also eaten/used by non-vegans directly, and indirectly via the livestock they consume.
1.5.6.3.3. Con: Welfare standards of farmers are a separate issue from the issues veganism tries to solve. You can just as easily be a vegan checking welfare standards \(or enforcing them through your government, depending on the level of democracy of your government\) as being a non-vegan checking those standards of the products you buy.
1.5.6.4. Con: Once people go vegan, they may want to reduce their negative social impact by buying local foods \(or even growing their own\).
1.5.6.4.1. Pro: Local and growing food industries might grow when everyone goes vegan, which will make it easier to avoid worker exploitation.
1.5.6.5. Pro: Many fair trade items are vegan products \(like [coffee, chocolate, sugar, bananas, tea, and cotton](http://www.fairtradeamerica.org/en-us/fairtrade-products)\) due to [worker inequality and poor working conditions](http://fairtradeamerica.org/What-is-Fairtrade/What-Fairtrade-does) necessitating their spot on the list.
1.5.7. Con: Saying that everybody should do something because somebody thinks this is good is the mix of arrogance and ignorance. The premise that all people should do something because it is wrong is just the version of the utilitarian utility. We can not say for sure whether eating meat is good or not. In such blurry case where moral standards cannot be applied the best thing to do is to let people act according to their needs and see what good will come out of their actions.
1.5.8. Con: At present human demand for meat outweighs our ethical concerns surrounding the eating of meat. We should consider a global adoption of veganism only when we collectively feel that the ethical considerations outweigh our global demand for meat consumption.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Even if people try, they might revert back to eating meat out of habit or subconscious actions that people are unaware of \(like still going to a favorite steakhouse without remembering that they are vegan now\). Thus, without taking motivation into consideration \(making sure people want to be vegan\) first, the worldwide vegan change would not last permanently.
1.5.8.2. Con: Demand for veganism will follow action if everyone goes vegan and the right motivators are in place \(like advertisements and convenience\). Thus, demand for meat shouldn't stop the world from trying to go vegan.
1.5.9. Con: The habitual, [instinctive](http://www.dana.org/News/Details.aspx?id=43484), natural behavior of killing/eating animals is not inherently immoral or unethical. It is a fundamental part of nature \(predators kill prey for food, and we are a top predator\) and modern human existence. People cannot be blamed for notions they are born with or the means they use to survive in an environment out of their control.
1.5.9.1. Con: Most humans do not simply walk by a meadow with grazing cows and develop a sudden bloodlust. Our instinct to kill has been weakened severely and most people would only kill as a last resort.
1.5.9.1.1. Pro: In the age of supermarkets, hunting is not necessary for survival, which decreases a person's use of their instincts to kill animals for food.
1.5.9.1.1.1. Con: Much of the world's population does not have access to a supermarket. Hunting is still absolutely necessary for them.
1.5.9.2. Con: Early modern humans were more prey than predator, evolving instincts to repulse animals \(like [phobias](https://hubpages.com/health/list-of-animal-phobias), [fight-or-flight](https://psychcentral.com/blog/whats-the-purpose-of-the-fight-or-flight-response/), [patternicity](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/patternicity-finding-meaningful-patterns/), and [anxiety](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_evolution/2012/10/evolution_of_anxiety_humans_were_prey_for_predators_such_as_hyenas_snakes.html)\) and not those to kill them. People's animal-killing desire is [unnatural](https://www.peta.org/living/food/really-natural-truth-humans-eating-meat/) and [rare](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2011/01/06/132708321/human-killing-instinct-really), associated with [sociopaths](https://prime.peta.org/2010/04/only-sociopaths-intentionally-hurt-animals-a-professional-view), and stems from [trauma in life](http://www.humanesociety.org/parents_educators/childhood_cruelty_breaking_cycle_abuse.html), not at birth. This and its [habitual progression](https://www.animallaw.info/article/link-cruelty-animals-and-violence-towards-people) make humans killing animals [immoral and unethical](http://www.straypetadvocacy.org/PDF/AnimalCrueltyLaws.pdf).
1.5.9.2.1. Pro: Even our [most common instinct](http://listverse.com/2018/09/02/10-facts-about-human-cannibalism-from-modern-science/) of animal-killing, intraspecies predation \([killing](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/human-violence-evolution-animals-nature-science/) and [eating humans](http://listverse.com/2018/09/02/10-facts-about-human-cannibalism-from-modern-science/), which are animals\), is [frowned upon](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-ridiculous-law-in-every-state-2014-2). In fact, it is so natural, some humans are [genetically resistant](http://listverse.com/2018/09/02/10-facts-about-human-cannibalism-from-modern-science/) to cannibalism-related diseases, like prions.
1.5.9.2.1.1. Con: If certain people evolved to be cannibals, that proves that [predation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predation) is in fact a natural instinct in humans.
1.5.9.2.2. Pro: Our bodies match our lack of predatory instincts and never really evolved them, because we outsourced our hunting capabilities to tools instead of our bodies \(except using our minds to hunt\). Without [tools](http://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/tools-food), getting meat would be very difficult, whereas it would be no issue for a carnivore or omnivore. They even [started to be used](http://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/tools-food) around when humans started eating meat.
1.5.9.2.3. Pro: Even when humans take on the role of being a predator, they act differently than most real predators by being a '[super-predator](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34011026)'. The behavior is so irregular, it is even [unsustainable](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-human-superpredator-unique-predator-carnivore-fishing-hunting-unsustainable-20150820-story.html) and devastates ecosystems. Humans are not meant to be predators and kill animals, our poor judgment and behavior illustrates it is not a natural instinct, even for nature.
1.5.9.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.7.
1.5.9.2.5. Con: Contrary to popular assumptions, there is evidence that humans have [specific hunting traits](https://www.livescience.com/4631-modern-humans-retain-caveman-survival-instincts.html), and often express a natural [hunting instinct](https://www.depauw.edu/humanimalia/issue%2015/dinets.html), which has a 'thrilling' effect that has been replicated by [hunting-based video games and sport \(rather than subsistence\) hunting, such as safari hunting and catch-and-release fishing.](http://www.utdailybeacon.com/news/professor-studies-hunter-instinct-within-humans/article_4c7e14f8-9f69-11e6-b59e-d391da16db17.html)
1.5.10. Pro: Because a vegan world would have less violence and cruelty than our world today where animals are killed and eaten, the knock on effects are something inconceivable to us currently. The possibilities for future moral benefits are virtually endless.
1.5.11. Con: Not all people share the same ethical principles, so vegan lifestyle doesn't bring moral benefits to all humans.
1.5.11.1. Pro: Veganism, unlike vegetarianism, stems from 20th century cultural movement in the West, i.e., [Lebensreform](https://www.ic.org/wiki/lebensreform/), which in itself is not necessarily illegitimate. Nevertheless, forcing non-Western societies to adopt it \(i.e. [Westernization](https://www.reference.com/world-view/westernization-af8f44660d958357)\) is a form of [neocolonialism](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Neocolonialism) and cultural imperialism.
1.5.11.2. Pro: Culture can influence lawmaking. If everyone becomes vegan \(of their own free will\), then laws could be made to force people into staying vegan.
1.5.11.2.1. Pro: Veganism imposes the will of the masses onto the few that do not comply, which is [groupthink](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/groupthink).
1.5.11.2.2. Pro: The restrictions could have short-term implications on businesses, economies, and individuals. restaurants would have to change their menus to vegan food in order to comply with laws. This could run up costs for them in the short-term.
1.5.11.2.3. Pro: The lack of freedom from the enforcement of vegan laws could have long-term individualistic implications. The laws could impact health, and could lead to increasing mental health issues.
1.5.11.2.3.1. Pro: The controlling tendencies of society to conform to veganism could lead to stress in a person's life, especially impactful during the formative years.
1.5.11.2.4. Pro: Law enforcement might get more severe under a vegan world, especially within the transition phase.
1.5.11.2.4.1. Pro: This could cost governments more money.
1.5.11.2.4.2. Pro: Law enforcement might take a more big brother omnipresence to counteract any betrayers of veganism.
1.5.11.2.4.2.1. Pro: People might get into trouble with law enforcement by deviating from vegan principles.
1.5.11.2.4.2.1.1. Con: This already happens, as people do go to jail and get fined for animal abuse, fishing in protected waters, and cutting down plants in protected zones.
1.5.12. Pro: Many of our achievements as a civilization have relied on controlling our violent and destructive tendencies and being compassionate instead. Choosing non-violence \(or minimal violence\) when it comes to our food is the next logical step in the development of a civilized population that grows beyond its biological instincts.
1.5.12.1. Pro: [Geniuses](https://www.elephantjournal.com/2011/02/the-worlds-greatest-geniuses-are-vegetarians/) \(from ancient to modern times and East to West\) form from practicing non-violence, which includes their [diets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vegetarians): Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, da Vinci, Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Tesla, Edison, Tolstoy, Franklin, Luther King, Van Gogh, Kafka, Henry Ford, Stephen Hawkins, Gaudí, Alan Calverd, Edward Witten, Brian Greene, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Carl Lewis, Matt Groening, etc.
1.5.13. Pro: Being vegan is the least we can do to leave the world a better place than it was when we got here.
1.5.14. Pro: Compassion is the highest form of living. Through a vegan lifestyle, we can align our actions with our morals to elevate our selves and existence. We can be better off than we are now, increasing the collective well-being of society.
1.5.15. Con: Global adoption of the vegan diet would restrict the growth of human civilization.
1.5.15.1. Pro: Livestock farming can take place across a range of diverse climatic and environmental regions meaning that this type of agriculture is potentially [less geographically-constrained](https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture#global-agricultural-land-use-today) than arable farming.
1.5.15.1.1. Con: Countries that don't have a lot of arable farmland available to them still need to import fodder from other places of the world.
1.5.15.1.2. Con: This can only work if the farmed animals are fed with by-products or scrap material, otherwise the fodder require arable farmlands.
1.5.15.2. Pro: Computer modelling indicates that the United States could support the largest human population on domestic production if everybody followed a [lacto-ovo vegetarian diet](https://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.12952/journal.elementa.000116/). A vegan diet came close, and provided much higher carrying capacity than the current baseline diet, but it did not maximize carrying capacity.
1.5.15.2.1. Con: While the vegetarian diet can maximize the use of all available land in the US, it is not necessary to use up every inch of land if you don't need it in order to sustain the population. This is like saying a school bus is better suited for transporting a family of six than a minivan.
1.5.15.2.2. Con: Many areas that can only be used as grazing land are barren because they have been exploited and overworked by human agriculture. Allowing these areas to be taken over by natural plants and forests again would benefit soil quality and biodiversity, there is no need to put animals on them for grazing.
1.5.15.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.
1.5.15.4. Pro: None of us would be here without meat. The abundance we have now to make vegan choices may not be around in the future. It may save our lives yet in case in times of famine/ration \(such as a natural or nuclear disaster\). People will not have choices then, just like they did not in the past.
1.5.15.4.1. Pro: All [hominin](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/hominin)s in genus [Australopithecus](http://slideplayer.com/slide/4892880/16/images/19/A+hominid+evolutionary+tree.jpg) went extinct, and many were vegan \([1](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120717084813.htm), [2](http://humanorigins.si.edu/research/whats-hot-human-origins/australopithecus-sediba-was-vegetarian)\). We survived and eat meat. Since going vegan did not work in the past, we should not repeat history by devolving to a trait with an unsuccessful outcome.
1.5.15.5. Con: Veganism is the necessary next step to progress human civilisation.
1.5.15.5.1. Pro: The word civilisation now means more than living in cities, it entails ideas of moral progress and codes of conduct. Someone who is uncivilised is regarded as brutish and lacking compassion.
1.5.15.5.2. Pro: Since [17%](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/what-the-world-eats/) of a diet's calories typically come from dairy and meat, and [obesity](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html) affects a significant portion of the population, plus is on the rise in [certain age groups](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/26/health/childhood-obesity-in-the-us-study/index.html), losing the calories from dairy and meat seems a logical choice in keeping a healthy weight. This will benefit civilization growth rather than harming it.
1.5.15.5.3. Pro: The world population growth is expected to stop at between [8 and 11 billion people](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/IFsWorldPopulationHistoryForecastII.jpg) within [this century](https://phys.org/news/2014-10-world-population-peak.html). With veganism, population will end up closer to the top of the range \([1](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160926-what-would-happen-if-the-world-suddenly-went-vegetarian), [2](https://www.livescience.com/16493-people-planet-earth-support.html)\).
1.5.15.5.3.1. Con: Maximizing the number of humans alive on this planet is not necessarily a good thing.
1.5.15.5.3.1.1. Pro: Even if maximized, there will be a limit to the earth's carrying capacity somewhere down the road. This means population control should be considered sooner or later. Changing to an \(arguably\) less optimal diet is just a way of kicking the can down the road.
1.5.15.5.4. Pro: Eating meat reflects poorly on humanity; it is a [barbaric](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34541077) and primitive practice that incorporates into the definition of what being a human is. Veganism is more civilized and will allow civilizations to grow through its positivity instead of being held back by the negative attributes of producing and eating meat.
1.5.15.5.4.1. Pro: The compassion that veganism brings allows for more openness that allows civilization to grow. With the openness, more lives can exist \(human and non-human\). The bigger the population, the greater the success of a civilization \(which is one of its purposes\).
1.5.15.6. Con: The word ['civilisation'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization) has a far broader meaning than just population numbers.
1.5.15.7. Con: Population growth is not a goal in itself to strive for. Quality of life is a better goal. This might require a lower population
1.5.15.8. Con: Eating meat will restrict where human civilization can go and grow, due to it being a major contributory factor in [climate change](http://meatclimatechange.org/).
1.5.15.8.1. Pro: Climate change causes [mass migrations, which in turn threatens food security](https://www.kcet.org/shows/earth-focus/episodes/climate-migration), which in turn impacts the growth of civilization.
1.5.15.8.2. Pro: The [sea level rise](https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/File/SS6M_SLR_Population_PercentCroppedScaled_650_425_s_c1_c_c.jpg) that comes with global warming will definitely impact the growth of human civilization. What was once land would not be available for building on and populating anymore.
1.5.15.9. Pro: People learn about animals through non-vegan activities, like eating meat, having pets, visiting zoos, and hunting. Taking those activities away would make vegans less aware of animals due to less interactions with them.
1.5.15.9.1. Con: These are artificial interactions. Vegans will create a better learning experience for understanding animals, because they will see them with natural behavior and form. This process will create a better understanding and appreciation than forced animal encounters.
1.5.15.9.2. Con: Non-vegan practices make learning about animals harder, because such practices cause extinctions and dangers to the learning process that can make learning about animals almost impossible at times.
1.5.15.9.2.1. Pro: People might get traumatized over learning about an animal if they think about the ethics of it dying to study it \(such as with biology dissections\).
1.5.15.9.3. Con: People do not need to partake in non-vegan activities to learn about animals when the information is available in books and technology \(which gets better each year\).
1.5.15.9.4. Pro: Being up close and personal with animals can foster compassion and sympathy towards more animals than not being near them.
1.5.15.9.5. Pro: Being near animals can help organizations bring animal-related issues to the public's attention, especially at zoos.
1.5.15.10. Con: Eating meat restricts civilizations due to the costs on society with health care \(as meat causes many chronic diseases that are expensive whether they get treated or not\).
1.5.15.11. Pro: -> See 1.5.11.1.
1.5.16. Con: -> See 1.4.11.3.
1.5.17. Pro: A [vegan approach](http://www.vegansociety.com) to the world tends to support the rights of humans, as well as benefiting animals.
1.5.17.1. Pro: The theory of [intersectional veganism](https://veganvoicesofcolor.org/2017/01/29/intersectional-veganism/) studies animal rights and how they fit into the context of oppression of various historic groups. The goal of intersectional veganism is to redefine society in a way that reduces oppression of all groups, not just animals.
1.5.17.1.1. Con: Intersectional veganism relies on the troubling premise that because some people treat human beings that look different from them akin to animals, we can improve the situation by treating animals better.  The more enlightened perspective would be to treat all humans regardless of racial differences as equally deserving of human rights.  Elevating the status of animals to is in no way required to believe that all humans possess individual rights.
1.5.17.2. Pro: Although the idea of everyone following a vegan diet is apparently ludicrous, it has been explored before, in the BBC Docu-comedy [Carnage](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/carnage-review-bbc-iplayer-simon-amstell-vegan-comedy-actually-funny-a7636871.html), showing how a society could function with veganism.
1.5.17.2.1. Pro: The comedy [effectively satirises](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/fran-carruthers/carnage_b_15560476.html) unethical parts of our society that we currently take for granted, indicating how considering the world from a vegan perspective can improve our moral clarity
1.5.17.3. Pro: If humans stopped treating animals as commodities \(like being objectified for consumption\), they would less likely utilize [dehumanization](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dehumanization) as a justification for making decisions.
1.5.17.3.1. Pro: The dehumanization could be a pretext for war.
1.5.17.3.1.1. Con: There is no scholarly research that shows a link between diet or veganism and a propensity to warfare.
1.5.17.3.1.2. Con: Lack of resources is what causes war.  If everyone goes to a vegan diet, there will be more competition for food, not less, leading to more desperation and starvation, and therefore, more war.
1.5.17.3.1.2.1. Pro: During a transition away from meat the upset to the existing food production network is very likely to cause shortages and increased competition.
1.5.17.3.1.2.1.1. Con: This is only short-term. In the long-term, these tensions will go away as non-vegan farms convert to vegan ones.
1.5.17.3.1.3. Pro: This is due to [demonizing the enemy to the point of thinking of them as subhuman](https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/dehumanization) to not treat them humanely, just like with commodifying animals.
1.5.17.3.1.4. Pro: Favoring one species over another might lead to people thinking about favoring one group of humans over another.
1.5.17.3.2. Pro: People might apply and transfer the principles of [speciesism](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/speciesism) to humans if the habit of eating meat is so ingrained into their lives that they see how the concept could apply to other lifestyle activities \(such as shopping, entertainment, travel...\).
1.5.17.3.2.1. Pro: People who eat meat might be more okay with people being exploited to make products on market, such as clothing.
1.5.17.3.3. Pro: People might apply their objectification tendencies to humans \(as humans are animals too\). This mindset could let people feel more justified in violating others rights.
1.5.17.3.4. Con: Since people have more rights and protections than animals, dehumanization is not likely to get enacted from this influence.
1.5.17.3.5. Con: People might likely be more dehumanized, as people who bother animals might find people as an alternative source to treat poorly when they go vegan.
1.5.17.4. Pro: Veganism allows us to fulfill our moral obligation \(in what humans agree is immoral\) through refraining from supporting animal food and entertainment industries \(due to their immoral practices\).
1.5.17.4.1. Pro: Examples of their practices are profiting from killing innocents, sexual abuse, torture, and all other forms of exploitation on an unwilling individual.
1.5.17.4.2. Pro: Once people start these practices, these industries will vanish. This will improve the morality of the economy as a whole.
1.5.17.4.2.1. Pro: People can inspire and feed off each other to achieve this.
1.5.17.4.2.1.1. Pro: When one person has a better idea of how to improve their morality, they can apply it to other industries. Then the net morality of all the industries combined goes up around them.
1.6. Con: Humanity becoming vegan does not resolve all the issues it tries to fix.
1.6.1. Pro: Veganism still negatively impacts animals and causes them harm \(even though the reason to be vegan is to avoid this\). A.K.A. not all 'vegan' food is really vegan.
1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.7.
1.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.6.1.3. Pro: Vegan food production utilizes animals to grow crops.
1.6.1.3.1. Pro: [Insects, such as bees and bumblebees, are consumed by the agriculture industry to grow crops.](https://www.kialo.com/should-all-bee-products-be-banned-1233/1233.0=1233.1+1233.387)
1.6.1.3.2. Pro: People sometimes use animals for fertilizer, such as [fish](https://groundtoground.org/2011/09/09/fertilizing-your-garden-with-fish/).
1.6.1.3.3. Pro: It is impossible to separate agricultural production from the use of [animal manures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5fJeCC3N9g), insect intrusion, and other interactions with animals. Keeping animal products off our plates is an artificial distinction.
1.6.1.3.3.1. Con: Veganism does not claim to be about "keeping animal products off our plates". It strives to reduce suffering where possible.
1.6.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.6.1.5. Pro: Veganism tries to prevent exploitation to animals, but still impacts humans \(which are animals\).
1.6.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.
1.6.1.5.2. Pro: With deforestation \(exploitation of animals' land for crops/timber\), [indigenous](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/09/16/indigenous-people-in-brazil-facing-deforestation-joblessness-seek-out-cities.html) cultures get lost and the people of them get a lower quality of life.
1.6.1.5.3. Pro: Veganism will [not solve hunger](http://veganzinga.com/going-vegan-wont-end-world-hunger/), because if there are no paying customers for the grain that is grown for livestock, then farmers will not grow it, or if they have it, give it to those in need.
1.6.1.6. Con: A modified vegan diet, that takes into account the production methods as well as the final product, would reduce this issue.
1.6.1.6.1. Pro: Veganic farming eliminate animal products and intentional harm to animals \(as with pesticides\) \([1](http://gentleworld.org/beginners-guide-to-veganic-gardening/), [2](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/03/veganic-farming.html)\) in its production.
1.6.2. Con: If a vegan diet were to resolve more problems than it causes, even if it fails to solve all problems, it would be better that everyone were vegan.
1.6.3. Con: Many of the issues that veganism currently creates would be worked out once the world transitions.
1.6.3.1. Pro: People are more likely to work on vegan-specific issues when living the lifestyle, because they are more "woke" to them.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Since the battle is over about whether people should eat meat or not, people will now transition their focus onto vegan-only battles.
1.6.3.3. Pro: Once everyone becomes vegan. vegan issues will become more pronounced and happen more often. This visibility will cause people to react and objectify to them, which will lead them to action.
1.6.3.4. Pro: Once everyone becomes vegan, more people could collaborate together to tackle the larger-scale vegan issues that cannot be achieved with the current vegan population status.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.3.
1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.
1.6.6. Con: Veganism is not about fixing all issues. It is about improving the "ethical footprint" of humans on nature. Even if not ALL humans would become vegan it would be an improvement.
1.6.6.1. Con: -> See 1.4.13.
1.6.6.2. Pro: A vegan world would massively reduce animal suffering, massively reduce land use and rain forest depletion, and massively reduce related health issues such as heart disease. That is enough.
1.6.7. Pro: Part of the reason why people would want veganism is to not get affected by food-borne illnesses from livestock \(even ones from [water](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/other/agricultural/contamination.html), [soil](http://www.backwoodshome.com/prevent-foodborne-illness-with-safe-gardening-methods-by-donna-insco/), and [crops](http://thehill.com/regulation/healthcare/252490-foodborne-illnesses-cost-us-77-billion-a-year-study-says) come from these animals too\). However, [wildlife may still be a source of food-borne illnesses in vegan food](http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/09/co-management-of-food-safety-risks-from-wildlife-the-environment/#.W0tkAdUzrIU).
1.6.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.13.
1.6.8. Con: This may be true, but going vegan gets rid of the focus on the meat topic and its problems \(namely environmental\), so the world can move onto other critical issues, like poverty and education.
1.6.9. Con: If you are to surmise all species suffering, the current levels of suffering in such number maybe the greatest tragedy the earth has witnessed. Over 50billion animals/year, a large percentage of which suffer for their entire existence, and have a complex neural network. [animalclock.org](https://animalclock.org/)
1.6.10. Con: Taxing the suffering is most likely the best way to improve the lot of factory-farmed animals. Taxing on plastic bags and CO2 has worked well in making markets adjust. So focusing on a workable tax system on animal suffering would fix the vegan mission statement in the quickest manner.
1.6.11. Pro: Large-scale veganism may be difficult to enforce \(especially in private settings\). Thus, while the world implements the practice, non-vegan occurrences may still happen in secret.
1.6.11.1. Pro: People may still poach, as that is really [difficult to enforce](http://www.africanindaba.com/2014/04/poaching-in-africa-facts-causes-and-solutions-april-2014-volume-12-3/).
1.6.11.1.1. Con: When people become vegan, they are less likely to buy animal products from poaching. Going vegan would definitely lessen its extent.
1.6.11.1.2. Pro: The products from poaching may make its way into consumer markets and vegans may buy animal products unknowingly if the vendors lie, hide sales from enforcement, or not label clearly and accurately.
1.6.11.1.3. Con: With a vegan world, people may take more actions and increase enforcement, due to the practice not fitting in with the new vegan world.
1.6.11.2. Pro: Human beings have an inherent right to privacy. Veganism cannot be adopted fully without infringing upon that right since it would have to be state mandated and enforced.
1.6.12. Con: There is no quick fix for humanity's largest challenges. Abandoning progress altogether because of that would not make sense.
1.6.13. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.6.14. Con: Not implementing something groundbreaking that solves many problems because it doesn't solve every problem it tries to fix is irrational.
1.6.15. Pro: Turning someone a vegan may not mentally have vegan views.
1.6.15.1. Pro: being a vegan does not necessarily equate to being an animal/nature lover
1.6.15.2. Pro: People may still not want to be vegan or believe in veganism, even if the world and they go vegan.
1.6.15.2.1. Pro: If too many people do not believe in veganism, even when the world turns vegan, the world turning vegan may only end up a short run instead of sustaining through the long-term.
1.7. Pro: The vegan lifestyle is better for the people who follow it.
1.7.1. Pro: Societal advancements towards veganism improve everyone's lives. Through intellect, any substitution and improvement is possible.
1.7.1.1. Pro: [Consumer demand](https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Up-Green-Child-Bestselling/dp/1416541241) could drive veganism advancements through changing and removing industries. One pivotal event displaying this is the replacement of [whale oil with kerosene](http://www.petroleumhistory.org/OilHistory/pages/Whale/whale.html).
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: If people stay healthy through participating in a vegan diet, then they could [avoid consuming medications](http://www.americanvegan.org/howtobevegan.html) made from animal products or involved animals in their research and testing.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Since people eat more varieties of plants on a vegan diet than an omnivorous one, people can learn about, appreciate, and have a desire to protect biodiversity more.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: Their habits also naturally protect biodiversity, because of the safeguarding of species out of consumer demand.
1.7.1.2.2. Con: Vegan foods decrease biodiversity through monocultures and growing in biodiverse regions, so ability of the vegan diet to protect biodiversity is questionable.
1.7.2. Pro: People can have vegan activities that fill their time just as well as non-vegan ones.
1.7.2.1. Pro: People do not need to create art \(for health, like art therapy\) with non-vegan materials \(like [chalk](http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Chalk.html) or [animal products in paint](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/vegan-art-supplies-1039508)\) in the digital age \(like electronics to create digital art\).
1.7.2.2. Pro: People could replace non-vegan [hobbies](http://www.notsoboringlife.com/list-of-hobbies/), like hunting, fishing, beach-combing, and building aquariums, with vegan ones like kayaking, yoga, genealogy, and robotics.
1.7.2.3. Pro: People can have an active life with activities that are vegan and have the same health benefits as those that are not. For instance, one could experience anywhere from fun to winning competitions doing mechanical bull rides as much as horseback riding.
1.7.2.4. Pro: People could swim in the ocean instead of pools \(which use [diatomaceous earth \(DE\) filters](http://www.poolcenter.com/dePoolFilter)\).
1.7.2.4.1. Pro: If a person owns a swimming pool, then they could switch to a [plant-based filter](https://www.poolsupplies.com/product/fiber-clear-filter-media), which is an an alternative to DE ones.
1.7.2.5. Pro: Instead of going to zoos and animal circuses, one could be around animals by visiting nature \(like a [national park, sanctuary, or preserve](http://www.americanvegan.org/howtobevegan.html)\) or viewing it through a [webcam](http://explore.org/).
1.7.3. Con: Plant fabrics, like [cotton](https://rodaleinstitute.org/chemical-cotton/), might contain pesticides, which are bad for health.
1.7.3.1. Con: This can be prevented by buying [organic cotton](http://web.archive.org/web/20180126184950/https://www.organiccotton.org/oc/Organic-cotton/Agronomic-practice/Pest-management.php).
1.7.4. Pro: People's wellbeing is improved by leading a vegan lifestyle.
1.7.5. Pro: Veganism sets life up for efficiency, as it is both [utilitarian](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080708064040AAuo70s) and [minimalist](https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/minimalism-and-veganism-crossover).
1.8. Pro: People can make vegan substitutions of non-vegan consumer products. These changes can be so minimal that they are unnoticeable. That way, people will not miss out on aspects of their previous lifestyle.
1.8.1. Pro: People do not need to buy pets to be healthy, especially since pets can make them [ill](https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/zoonotic-diseases.html), trigger [allergic reactions](http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/general-health/air/air-quality-pet-dander.php), and create overall [health risks](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/pets/advice/g595/pet-health-risks/?slide=1) to people in general \(especially owners\).
1.8.1.1. Pro: Pet foods with meat is not necessary to buy if people's pets are herbivores, such as [hamsters and rabbits](http://www.vegansouls.com/pets-for-vegan).
1.8.1.2. Con: Pets can actually help to [improve your immune system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex5y6OVVHe0).
1.8.2. Pro: Vegan jewelry, like gemstones \(excluding [amber](http://www.ambericawest.com/baltic/)\), bamboo beads, twine, [seeds](https://jennyhoople.com/shop/jobs-tears-seeds-ready-for-beading-andor-viable-for-growing/), and porcelain could replace [non-vegan ones](http://www.americanvegan.org/howtobevegan.html).
1.8.3. Pro: People do not need to wear clothing from animal products to stay healthy, even in extreme weather.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Leather is an inessential clothing material that can be replaced by [plant fibers](https://www.trustedclothes.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/fiber-plants.png) if everyone went vegan.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: Because leather is a [byproduct of the meat industry](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/27/ethicalfashion.leather), it is a waste not to use it. However, if everyone went vegan, there would be no worries of wasting resources \(because the meat industry would not exist to create such byproduct\).
1.8.4. Pro: People can by soap bars without [tallowates](https://www.sharecare.com/health/skin-cleansing-products/what-is-sodium-tallowate), such as castille soap bars.
1.8.5. Pro: There are [vegan cosmetics](https://theaspiringvegans.com/how-to-identify-vegan-cosmetics/#more-356) that people can learn about and [buy](https://www.vegan.com/guides/makeup/) these days.
1.8.6. Pro: This is a benefit, because when people who consume non-vegan products switch to vegan ones, they will not miss/crave them anymore.
1.8.7. Con: Vegan substitutes help solve the problem of animal cruelty. But the increase of its consumption is not regulated and generates other sustainability related issues  .
1.8.7.1. Pro: Market pressures on local prices reduces affordability for local populations for which it is a staple food for 4,000 years. In [Bolivia and Peru, quinoa](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2013/01/quinoa_bad_for_bolivian_and_peruvian_farmers_ignore_the_media_hand_wringing.html) causes this issue.
1.8.7.2. Pro: Fair Trade programs are [outdated and sometimes inefficient](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_problem_with_fair_trade_coffee)
1.8.7.3. Pro: Quinoa is very thirsty to grow, especially in with monoculture/industrial methods. Local water resources are getting depleted.
1.8.7.3.1. Pro: Monoculture crops can also lead to a [drop in the local biodiversity](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/food-system-monocultures-gm-un-diversity-day).
1.8.7.4. Pro: Market regulation for superfoods are too relaxed, pressured by the boom of the demand. This causes issues at times, like in the [supply chain and with sustainability](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/magazine/the-superfood-gold-rush.html).
1.8.8. Con: Most of the vegan "alternatives" taste horrible.
1.8.8.1. Con: If it were true that vegan alternatives taste horrible, we wouldn't see an [increasing number](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-opinion/rise-rise-veganism-global-market-14199168) of vegan shops, brands and alternatives.
1.8.8.2. Con: It would be safe to assume that most omnivores have also had their share of bad animal-containing meals. Just because people might have had bad luck with some vegan products, that doesn't mean the entire \(very diverse\) food group of animal alternatives can't possibly be tasty.
1.8.8.3. Con: Like with any new industry, there is a certain trial and error period. As more customer feedback is coming in and production methods are refined, meat alternatives get better and better.
1.8.8.4. Con: They taste horrible with an omnivore palate \(or even a vegan's\). However, vegan alternatives are the 'lesser of two evils', because they taste slightly better than meat. This gets found out once people eat vegan alternatives and try to go back to eating meat. The meat tastes horrible in comparison and forces them, by default, back to the vegan alternatives.
1.8.8.5. Con: Meat can taste horrible too, yet we don't see that abandoned. We shouldn't abandon vegan alternatives either, just because they taste bad \(especially when they're always improving, unlike meat\).
1.8.8.6. Con: If people do not like the taste of vegan alternatives, they do not need to eat it when going vegan. This should not be a determinant in deciding whether the world goes vegan or not, because it is not a requirement.
1.8.8.7. Pro: With 'nice' cream, ingredients are exchanged with sub-par alternatives \(like oil for milk\) and extra chemicals \(like gums, stabilizers...\), that they just taste bad. When vegan foods come with viable substitutes that mimic 'the real deal', then more people would like vegan alternatives taste-wise.
1.8.8.8. Pro: In addition to tasting bad, they also are more expensive and less nutritious.
1.8.8.9. Pro: Most people are accustomed to meat and since the human palate is very fine-tuned to taste nuances, any little change would make an alternative not taste the same at best and horrible at worst.
1.8.9. Con: Many alternatives are soy based. Soy production is a main driver in deforestation.
1.8.9.1. Con: Soy cultivation--particularly in heavily deforested regions such as the Amazon--often regularly carried out in areas that were previously cleared for animal agriculture \(cattle\).\[[1](http://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/where_we_work/amazon/amazon_threats/unsustainable_cattle_ranching/cattle_ranchin.cfm)\] Thus, it is animal agriculture that remains mainly responsible for deforestation, with even Brazil's government acknowledging that 80% of deforestation is as a result of cattle farming.\[[2](https://www.greenpeace.org/archive-international/en/publications/reports/slaughtering-the-amazon/),[3](https://foodrevolution.org/blog/the-truth-about-grassfed-beef/)\]
1.8.10. Con: Many of these vegan/vegetarian alternatives are [more processed](http://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/food/article/fake-meat-gets-real) than their meat counterparts. More processing is definitely less healthy than less.
1.8.10.1. Con: If one makes meat alternatives at home \(like a raw veggie patty\), then it would require less processing than a meat patty \(which requires packaging and cooking\)
1.8.10.2. Con: "Processed = not healthy" is a false implication and a naturalistic fallacy. Some forms of processing actually increase the availability of certain nutrients in foods, others simply improve texture or shelf life and don't harm the end product at all.
1.8.10.2.1. Pro: Processing doesn't determine how healthy an item of food is. Meat can carry far more, and often worse, diseases which is infinitely more unhealthy than just "processed" food.
1.8.10.2.1.1. Pro: If meat is raw and uncooked, then it is even less healthy than cooked, because of the diseases it carries that get 'removed' in the cooking process.
1.8.10.3. Con: How processed a food is is not easily measurable, because criteria is difficult to determine \(Is it number of production steps? What is classified as a single step?\), If you include the effort you need to raise, keep, transport, medicate and slaughter animals, the steps increase dramatically for meat products than vegan ones.
1.8.10.3.1. Con: Looking at all the steps, vegan foods tend to have a lot too \(except if picked yb the one eating it\), from buying seeds, to planting, watering, picking, packing, shipping, shelving, buying, processing, cooking, serving, and eating.
1.8.11. Pro: People can make vegan choices for spaces they occupy without compromising quality and integrity.
1.8.11.1. Pro: [Faux fur](https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/house-garden/furniture/best-faux-fur-rug-sheepskin-white-black-large-a7529266.html) rugs can replace traditional fur rugs.
1.8.11.2. Pro: People do not need to make homes sourced with once-living materials \(like [marble](https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/acidrain/4.html) counter-tops\) to make it livable, safe, and healthy to live in when non-living materials work just as well \(like [granite](http://solidsurface.com/ideas-guides/materials/granite) counter-tops\)
1.8.12. Pro: Not only are vegan changes minimal, but an enhancement to a previous animal-inclusive life.
1.8.12.1. Pro: Vegan food requires less processing than animal products.
1.8.12.1.1. Pro: Vegans do not need to kill their food to eat it, whereas meat eaters do. Vegans can pick foliage and fruit from a plant without killing it. However, animals need to die in order to eat their flesh.
1.8.12.1.2. Pro: Vegans are able to avoid cooking that animal products require to avoid food-borne illnesses.
1.8.12.1.2.1. Pro: Raw milk is known for a host of [pathogens](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/rawmilk/raw-milk-questions-and-answers.html) if not cooked.
1.8.12.1.2.2. Pro: Some animal products can avoid cooking, especially freshly-killed animals. However, it is a rarity for omnivores to avoid cooking, whereas the opposite occurs with vegans.
1.8.13. Con: People who enjoy hunting will miss killing animals.
1.8.13.1. Con: There are substitutes for hunting, such as video games, VR, and target practice in national forests. Better ones may also come along when people forgo hunting for veganism.
1.8.14. Con: Many non-food items contain irreplaceable animal products, for example personal computer. Animal products are used in multitude of products nobody really thinks of.
1.8.15. Con: Many replacements for animal products are far more harmful to health and environment.
1.9. Pro: Veganism as a worldwide behavioral [public health intervention strategy](http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/faculty/detels/PH150/Detels_Intervention.pdf) improves community/[population health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690307/) outcomes \(includes global\).
1.9.1. Pro: Vegan diet has shown to [lower fertility](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/mens-health/11172519/Vegetarians-have-much-lower-sperm-counts.html), making a task of reproduction \(one of [key functions of any living organism](http://www.web-formulas.com/Biology_Topics/Living_Organism_and_Its_Functions.aspx)\) more difficult to achieve. Therefore, it cannot be an optimal, or even healthy diet for humans as species.
1.9.2. Pro: certain vegan foods - \>fertility maca as an example: [natural-fertility-info.com](https://natural-fertility-info.com/maca)
1.9.3. Pro: people learn to adapt by avoiding foods like soy \(phytoestrogens\) that \<fertility.

1.9.5. Pro: population sustainability issues of veganism
1.9.6. Pro: veganism can lead to depopulation
1.9.6.1. Pro: vegan diet - \<population - might be good thing - as world is getting overpopulated [borgenproject.org](https://borgenproject.org/overpopulation-public-health/) [www.medicalnewstoday.com](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/284619.php) [www.healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/overpopulation-driving-global-health-crisis-031914#2) [www.renewableresourcescoalition.org](https://www.renewableresourcescoalition.org/overpopulation-causes-effects-solutions/)
1.9.6.2. Pro: anti-natalism - vegan agenda [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlhL-WQ_X2Y)

1.9.9.

Effects might be decreased by removing farm animals, as their #'s increase as human populations increase, causing crowding-related issues [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/19/population-crisis-farm-animals-laying-waste-to-planet)
1.9.10. Pro: If pesticides are used on crops \(especially greater use with GMO crops resistant to pesticides\), then a vegan diet might not be healthier for [populations nearby growing areas](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/23/hawaii-birth-defects-pesticides-gmo).
1.9.11. Con: Veganism can lead to depopulation, which is detrimental to humankind.
1.9.11.1. Pro: Some agendas within the vegan population encourage depopulation, such as antinatalism.
1.9.11.2. Con: Depopulation is beneficial to the humanity's survival, as it will help sustain the human population at a steady rate.
1.9.11.2.1. Pro: The world is overpopulated for various reasons, and animal agriculture is a main contributor. Veganism can protect against overpopulation and its effects through depopulation \(if it is mild\) to make the worldwide quality-of-living higher than now.
1.9.11.3. Pro: Certain plants produce phytochemicals that decrease fertility, such as phytoestrogens in soy.
1.9.11.3.1. Con: Scientists can create GMO versions of crops, like soy, to not contain phytochemicals that decrease fertility.
1.9.11.3.2. Con: Animal products also increase infertility as well.
1.10. Con: Veganism is too hard for people to follow and adopt, making a vegan world nearly impossible.
1.10.1. Pro: Veganism is extreme, Vegetarian is perfectly ethical and gives more choice.
1.10.1.1. Con: The egg and dairy industry routinely kills and mistreats male animals at a very young age, and in the case of dairy, often causes severe distress to the mother as they're separated permanently. There is nothing ethical about any of this.
1.10.2. Con: Veganism, unlike what most people believe, is super [easy to adopt](http://features.peta.org/how-to-go-vegan/) and absolutely [feasible](https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/cost-vegan-diet-international-perspective).
1.10.3. Pro: Many people with eating and nutritional-based disabilities may be unable to remove meats from their diets.
1.10.3.1. Pro: For those who previously suffered from an eating disorder, going vegan may increase their risk of a relapse, due to the ease with which their old eating disorder may [become](http://www.thebalancedblonde.com/2014/06/23/why-im-transitioning-away-from-veganism/) a [restriction-based eating disorder](https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/the-problem-with-going-vegan-after-recovering-from-an-eating-disorder).
1.10.3.2. Pro: Some [medications](https://www.livestrong.com/article/484289-medications-that-inhibit-iron-absorption/) and medical conditions \(e.g. [menorrhagia](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/blooddisorders/women/menorrhagia.html)\) can create predispositions for chronic anaemia. This can impact the effort/ costs associated with going vegan \(which is easier to get an iron deficiency with than eating meat\), and may even make it medically ill-advised.
1.10.3.2.1. Pro: Plant sources of iron only contain non-heme forms of iron, while meat sources contain both heme and non-heme. This source makes the iron content [more available for absorption and use in the body](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/) \(known as the bioavailability of a nutrient\). Vegans/vegetarians are expected to have almost 2x the recommended intake of iron to get sufficient iron absorption. This can be very difficult for someone with anaemia to build up their iron levels on a vegan diet, and even worse with a medical condition.
1.10.3.3. Con: The [definition](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) of veganism is: "A way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose." In the \(unlikely\) case of survival or health concerns, the "as far as possible and practicable" clause makes it possible for such persons to be considered vegan as they would have no alternative options.
1.10.3.3.1. Con: That definition is too vague. There are [different definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism#cite_note-13) of veganism, many of which are not compatible with using animals in any circumstances. In a way we are all vegan depending on how easy you believe it is to reach all the necessary nutrition in your city harming as few animals as possible.
1.10.3.3.2. Pro: Veganism is not solely about diet. A person can still choose to live in accordance with vegan values, such as by avoiding animal circuses and leather/fur products.
1.10.3.4. Pro: If someone is stranded \(which is a temporary eating disability\), eating meat would help a person survive their circumstances.
1.10.3.4.1. Con: There are methods to surviving when stranded on a vegan diet, such as eating vegetation and not exerting oneself too much to conserve energy and nutrients.
1.10.3.4.1.1. Pro: If people learn about what they can forage in the wild, they may find great success in their dire situation
1.10.3.4.1.2. Con: If vegetation is not around \(such as in the middle of the ocean\), meat would be the only sensible food option there.
1.10.3.4.2. Pro: People who are vegan may still choose to not eat meat even then, but to impose that decision onto others \(like making the world vegan\) would not be ethical.
1.10.3.5. Pro: Genetic conditions that cause nutritional deficiencies can prevent a person from removing meat from their diet.
1.10.3.5.1. Pro: [Retinol deficiency](https://www.healwithfood.org/vitamin-retinol/genetic-deficiency.php) is a genetically pre-disposed condition that prevents conversion beta-carotene to Vitamin A \(retinol\) in humans. Since plants have no retinol \(only beta-carotene\), humans with this condition cannot have a vegan diet, only one with animal products.
1.10.3.5.1.1. Con: However, even then the source does not have to be meat; a vegetarian diet with milk and eggs would suffice.
1.10.3.5.2. Con: People with [hemochromatosis](https://hemochromatosishelp.com/heme-iron-vs-non-heme-iron/) \(a [genetic condition](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hereditary-hemochromatosis)\) can benefit greatly from a vegan diet, due to the lower absorbing non-heme iron in plants \(compared to heme iron in meat\).
1.10.3.6. Con: Rare disorders should not stop the world from becoming vegan, as more people will benefit than be negatively impacted. [Top diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) would be reduced so much with a vegan diet, that more individuals globally would benefit from going vegan than the reverse, just to prevent rare vegan-related and -specific medical conditions from occurring.
1.10.3.6.1. Pro: More eating and nutritional-based disabilities are caused by meat rather than the other way around \(the largest cause of death in the US is [heart disease](http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/557851c26da8114d1474389d-800-800/causes-of-death2.png), which meat contributes to, yet benefits from a [vegan diet](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-right-plant-based-diet-for-you)\).
1.10.3.6.1.1. Con: We should make exceptions for the rare diseases that require meat if the world goes vegan.
1.10.3.6.1.2. Pro: A vegan world will find solutions to issues so they would not be a problem. Society may opt for genetic modification to prevent rare genetic conditions that require meat from existing. Without rare disorders existing, they would not get in the way of the world being vegan.
1.10.3.6.2. Pro: People who eat meat can create their own nutrition-based disabilities that require them to eat meat once they have it \(like [kidney disease](http://jacknorrisrd.com/are-there-medical-conditions-requiring-animal-foods/)\). If people stop eating meat to begin with, they would not damage their bodies to create their limited food options and preventable diseases.
1.10.3.6.2.1. Pro: The reason why people go towards meat, is because their nutritional-based disability comes from eating meat and makes eating plant-based foods difficult \(like diabetes \(eating fruit\) and Chron's disease - [1](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jul/16/health.food), [2](https://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20560523,00.html)\). If people just avoid meat, they would not be forced to eat it later in life.
1.10.3.6.2.2. Pro: Also, if people stop creating their own preventable diseases from eating meat \(like [thyroid conditions from mercury in fish](https://www.amymyersmd.com/2015/07/the-toxin-heavy-metal-and-thyroid-connection/)\), they would not require [animal-based](https://fpnotebook.com/Pharm/Adverse/AnmlDrvdPhrmctcls.htm) \(including from meat\) and -tested medications.
1.10.3.7. Pro: Not everybody can be vegan. Some may encounter difficulties when eating too many fibers or vegetal proteine, and may be forced to resort to meat for their diet
1.10.3.8. Pro: Those with [IBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome) often cannot tolerate [gluten](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/), most nuts, [beans and legumes](https://areyoutheresoy.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/low-fodmap.jpg), foods [high in insoluble fiber](https://www.webmd.com/ibs/ibs-triggers-prevention-strategies), or even at times [soy](https://www.ibsdiets.org/fodmap-diet/fodmap-food-list/) products. This makes it nearly impossible to consume the daily protein requirement. A vegan diet would simply cause further health complications for individuals who require animal products to survive.
1.10.3.8.1. Con: Requiring animal products with IBS is an exaggeration, as people can be vegan on this diet. Even though some websites say to stay away from these foods and eat animal products instead, other [websites](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-health/ibs-ibd-and-the-role-of-diet/) say that animal products are the triggers and the stated vegan foods are possible to have with IBS.
1.10.3.8.2. Con: People do not have to eat gluten, nuts, beans, legumes, high insoluble fiber, and soy to be vegan and healthy \(a.k.a. getting enough protein\). [Rice](http://www.theveganrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fodmap-handouts-1.pdf) can replace wheat, and [quinoa](http://www.theveganrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fodmap-handouts-1.pdf) \(a [complete protein](https://www.livestrong.com/article/378479-is-quinoa-a-complete-protein-food/)\) can replace legumes and nuts. Also, people can eat soluble fiber instead of insoluble fiber.
1.10.4. Con: Veganism gives people [more energy and helps them feel better](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/natural-health/health-benefits-within-one-week-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet/). Thus, while it is hard to follow at first, once people start to feel better from it, it will get better and easier.
1.10.5. Con: If veganism were "too hard" no one could go vegan. Thousands of people are vegan so this argument isn't fallacious, and irrelevant: the prevalence of veganism or lack thereof is not an argument against whether people should follow it or not.
1.10.5.1. Con: Thousands of people are professional athletes but most people lack the desire or dedication to train to that level. So it is with veganism. Claiming that "some" can do it therefore "everyone" can do is it fallacious.
1.10.6. Con: The most difficult part of being vegan is breaking non-vegan habits because taste is habitual. Once these habits are broken, veganism is cheaper, easier and \(in most cases\) healthier
1.11. Con: There was never a vegan society existing that could sustain itself for a longer period.
1.12. Con: Veganism is not feasible for less privileged societies or individuals.
1.12.1. Con: Affordability does not determine whether something is good or desirable. If the thesis was "All humans should have access to clean water" nobody would dispute that on the basis of economic feasibility.
1.12.1.1. Con: Economics bars access.  The thesis is not 'All humans should have access to food', but that they should only consume certain kinds of food.  There are many geographic areas where meat and fish is cheaper, more abundant and easily attainable than fruits and vegetables.
1.12.1.1.1. Con: There are a rare few exceptional places which hunt for their food, but that is not all humans. All humans with a number of potential exceptions could have cheaper vegan food by making educated choices or if governments subsidised the food in the [same](https://plenteousveg.com/cost-vegan-protein-vs-animal-protein/) ways as meat, dairy and eggs are [subsidised](https://meatonomics.com/tag/meat/).
1.12.2. Pro: [1/7](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM) of the world populations income depends directly or indirectly on livestock. Without alternative production methods a vegan world would result in more poverty of the rural areas.
1.12.2.1. Con: The world population still needs to eat, the 1/7th of the world population will work on crop production/distribution.
1.12.2.2. Pro: Not every arable land of the world is suitable for crop production and a lot of byproducts of the human food production are not edible for humans, but for ruminants.
1.12.2.3. Pro: In Catholicism, fish is exempt from the "no meat during lent" rule because of communities that relied on fishing for food.
1.12.2.4. Con: "more poverty of the rural areas" - as you have described an area to be in poverty then that should include all living species within that area, of which include thousands of animals. The argumentation here is based on animal life having no value but commodity, and human life is the only one of importance. 'Poverty' can come in many forms and be applies to many lives.
1.12.2.5. Con: Raising livestock makes poverty worse in rural areas than crops do, because livestock is less sustainable, ruining the land quicker until there is not much left, leaving people with no other means to keep their jobs going. It forces them to leave where they live, forcing them into more poverty yet. So a vegan world would result in less poverty than more.
1.12.3. Con: A balanced vegetarian diet is cheaper than a balanced diet that includes meat.
1.12.3.1. Pro: Rice and beans are very cheap, and in fact are a staple for much of the 'less privileged' societies in the world.

China's demand for meat [has increased as it got richer](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/30/food.china1). [This trend follows in other developing countries](https://www.voanews.com/a/decapua-farm-animals-29mar12-144898655/179917.html). The poor still eat rice and vegetables, [which even the WHO knows is a more efficient use of resources](http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/3_foodconsumption/en/index4.html).
1.12.3.2. Pro: [A study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19320248.2015.1045675?journalCode=when20) comparing a healthy diet that included meat, and a healthy diet that did not, found that the non-meat diet saved over $700 a year.
1.12.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.6.2.
1.12.3.2.2. Con: This study is geographically constrained to the USA, so it cannot be used to support the claim that a vegan diet is cheaper everywhere.
1.12.3.3. Pro: Some [NGOs](https://ffl.org/food-yoga/why-vegan/) who fight hunger across the world only provide vegetal foods. Main reason is the lower cost.
1.12.3.4. Con: Real life experience, including all supplements and so on, shows that a vegan diet is far more expensive.
1.12.3.5. Con: Replacing all non-food animal products is extremely expensive.
1.12.4. Con: Veganism is more economically feasible for less privileged societies than feeding, raising, butchering, and refrigerating livestock.
1.12.4.1. Pro: Rice and beans can be grown in some of the worst arable agriculture conditions imaginable \([USDA Hardiness Zones](https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/) 9b-10a\) and is a staple food in poorer parts of developing nations including [China](http://adoptionnutrition.org/nutrition-by-country/china/). [Meat dependence increases with a nations wealth, not decreases.](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Per-capita-gross-domestic-product-GDP-and-meat-consumption-by-country-2005-source_fig2_273483292)
1.12.5. Con: A vegan society would be more economically efficient.
1.12.5.1. Pro: Technological innovations could take place to advance a vegan society.
1.12.5.1.1. Pro: [Biofuel](http://www.digitalrefining.com/news/1003742,Axens____Vegan____technology_selected_by_Total_for_its_first_Biorefinery_in_France.html#.Ww7tA-6UvIV) is a great technology that a could improve a vegan society's current fuel resources.
1.12.5.1.1.1. Pro: Biofuel is better than other fuels, as it does not contain [sulfur/aromatic compounds](http://www.digitalrefining.com/news/1003742,Axens____Vegan____technology_selected_by_Total_for_its_first_Biorefinery_in_France.html#.Ww7tA-6UvIV) that other fuels contain.
1.12.5.1.1.2. Pro: Biofuel is so new and advanced, that this vegan industry can generate skilled jobs.
1.12.5.1.2. Pro: This could allow the people that lose employment in non-vegan industries could gain them in the vegan ones. It could possibly lead to more jobs than ever before!
1.12.5.1.2.1. Pro: Non-vegan industries might not have as much automation as older industries, which would at least lead to a temporary job boom. One example of an industry switch could be from [coal to renewable energy](https://www.fromtheashesfilm.com/).
1.12.5.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.5.1.1.2.
1.12.5.1.2.3. Con: Workers would have trouble applying their meat-processing skills in other \(i.e. vegan\) industries, because they aren't transferable.
1.12.5.2. Pro: Animal farming is [subsidized](https://www.verantwoordeveehouderij.nl/nl/Verantwoorde-Veehouderij-2/show-5/Subsidie-belangrijke-inkomensbron-voor-veehouder-in-Europa.htm) by governments to keep prizes unnaturally low. In 2016: Netherland 3.50 Euro/liter milk, Germany 7 euro/liter milk and Poland more than 10 euro/liter milk.
1.12.5.2.1. Pro: If everyone eats vegan, then the subsidies from meat could go into vegan products to make them cheaper.
1.12.5.2.1.1. Pro: If the [$38 billion of subsidies that went to meat](https://meatonomics.com/tag/meat/) goes to fruit and vegetables \(which are already cheap\), then there would be multiple benefits.
1.12.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Creating produce would become more efficient, because the money could go to innovations that could make produce even cheaper yet.
1.12.5.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: This could help save resources even more on top of the resources saved from switching away from meat.
1.12.5.2.1.1.2. Pro: The price of produce would go to zero \(the already low cost is less than the high subsidy\), which could make healthy food free and potentially end hunger.
1.12.5.3. Pro: India has a vegetarian population of [~30%](https://www.dawn.com/news/1206096), of which the majority of this group is the most impoverished. This suggests that veganism can be an affordable diet for societies. It is a myth that an omnivore diet is cheaper.
1.12.5.3.1. Pro: Grains and legumes make up the majority of a vegan diet's protein and calorie content. Those are very inexpensive food items that are often available in bulk \(reducing the price further\), making them better suited for people with instable income.
1.12.5.3.1.1. Con: Meat can be bought in bulk too, making meat cheap too. Buying in bulk to save on price is not food-specific. Buying meat in bulk \(reduces its subsidized price further\) helps those with an unstable income buy it.
1.12.5.3.1.2. Con: Grains and legumes contain huge amounts of anti-nutrients and plant poison.
1.12.6. Con: This statement is true but it also affirms that for most humans veganism should be adopted as a norm.
1.12.7. Pro: Animal agriculture allows societies and individuals to use their resources more efficiently and thrive as a result. In a vegan world, they may not.
1.12.7.1. Pro: If you were born in a agriculturally hostile territory you couldn't rely on food other than meat to sustain yourself.
1.12.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.
1.12.7.1.2. Con: Dedicated efforts for self sufficiency are possible even in hostile environments. Regional specialties can arise in this way. For example, Kurdistan is [self sufficient in fruit and vegetables](http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/070820172) meaning it would be likely to be able to support itself in a vegan world.
1.12.7.1.2.1. Con: The link is more or less a propaganda of the government there. It might be true, but there is no hard data presented. Also, it is worth taking note that the country is self sufficient only in the current distribution of food, which includes animal nutrition sources. It is not suggested anywhere that it might have the same self sufficiency and could ensure a proper diet with a population which would eat only vegan food.
1.12.7.1.3. Pro: The Inuit Population solely relies on Fish, since they live in the harsh conditions of the Arctic lands. It is obvious that diets should be adapted to the different environments. Exceptions will always persist.
1.12.7.1.4. Pro: Farming animals is often the only means available for farmers, e.g. farmers use animals to store energy for harsh winters or where the terrain doesn't allow for intensive crop farming.
1.12.7.1.4.1. Con: Intensive farming is a particular case. This way of doing agriculture is not even tenable. Its not the only way to produce crops.
1.12.7.1.4.2. Con: Storing energy for winters is possible without livestock, by using a granary.
1.12.7.2. Pro: Crops' co-products and plants that [cannot be eaten by humans](http://www.cast-science.org/download.cfm?PublicationID=278268&File=1e30d1bf7a7156ce24b3154cc313b587d97bTR) can convert to animal feed.
1.12.7.2.1. Con: Inedible \(to humans\) feed is not a viable option. Livestock [cannot compete with energy](http://www.globalharvestinitiative.org/2013/10/livestock-and-feed-conversion-food-producers-or-food-thieves/) for inedible food, which forces them to compete with humans for their edible food supply.
1.12.7.2.2. Pro: The benefits to the conversion are valorizing and preserving certain environments \(such as [grassland](http://w3.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/grass.htm)\) that crops cannot and allowing more diverse crop rotation \(which resolves [tillage damage](https://www.agweb.com/article/cover-crops-and-cattle-are-cash-naa-chris-bennett/)\).
1.12.7.2.2.1. Pro: This can provide a double benefit, as less grains would need to be grown for livestock, which preserves grasslands even more \(by not cutting them down for crops\).
1.12.7.2.2.2. Con: In the real world, this is not the case. [Overgrazing](https://www.desertusa.com/desert-food-chain/food-chain-6.html) due to population gains of cattle in grasslands is a real threat to the land's decline.
1.12.7.2.2.3. Con: Vegan food have the same capabilities as livestock to achieve these goals.
1.12.7.2.2.3.1. Pro: If people ate foods that they normally are not accustomed to \(such as native plants\), then they could preserve environments to without resorting to livestock \(just like how Native Americans acquire [chia seeds and acorns](https://www.kcet.org/shows/tending-the-wild) while the preserving the wild\)
1.12.7.2.2.3.2. Pro: Plants \(like [oats](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/opinion/sunday/crop-rotation-and-the-future-of-farming.html)\) can reverse damage caused by livestock with crop rotation.
1.12.7.3. Pro: Use of animals in farming initially made use of underutilized fibres, indigestible to humans, and still does so \([1](https://qknowbooks.gitbooks.io/jhs_1_science-farming-systems/mixed_farming.html)\). Use of animals saves human labour \(and therefore nutritional requirements, fuel use etc\) and produces edible food by fertilizing arable land, simultaneously consuming unwanted and underutilized resources in locations where crops useful for humans cannot be readily grown \([2](http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/rural_environments/farming_rural_areas_rev2.shtml)\). Thus, the use of animals is not only more cost effective for agrarian communities, but often necessary.
1.12.7.3.1. Con: This argument is not valid for the present time as ecosystems such as rainforests that hold vast nutrition for humans is cut down to make space for animal farming. [rainforests.mongabay.com](https://rainforests.mongabay.com/amazon/amazon_destruction.html)
1.12.7.3.2. Con: Our demand for meat requires us to then grow these crops, which then takes land and resources to do. Wild animals graze and consume these resources, so they do not go unutilized, they support an ecological cycle.
1.12.7.4. Con: The conversion of crops into meat is in fact a very inefficient process \(both time and resources\) compared to the direct consumption of plant matter.[\(Eschel, et al. 2016\)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.6b01006)
1.12.7.4.1. Pro: Meat accounts for 17% of global calorific intake, while using twice the amount of resources including land, water and feed. [economist.com](https://www.economist.com/feast-and-famine/2013/12/31/meat-and-greens)
1.12.7.5. Pro: Nomadic people grow livestock instead of crops, because of their traveling lifestyle. Livestock provides more resource efficiency than vegan foods do for them.
1.12.8. Pro: Many consumers and producers would suffer economically without animal agriculture.
1.12.8.1. Pro: The move to veganism would cause mass unemployment as farming, beekeeping, meat processing, and many other jobs would end. This would cause massive poverty, much as the [deindustrialisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindustrialization) has done already but on a larger scale.
1.12.8.1.1. Pro: Meat is not the only product from meat-industry, going vegan will affect farming practices, since meat [by-products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_product) are also used as fertilizers as well as in other chemical production utilizing [bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_char), [fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallow), [hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_fiber) and [hooves](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5792a41a59cc68d6c93ced4f/t/5a78e0f4652deabd9163410b/1517871349410/Industrial_Application.pdf) + [horns](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23410124) \(last 3 are major source of keratin\) to mention a few.  This will have a dramatic impact on many economies.
1.12.8.1.2. Con: The [demand](https://healthcaretrends24.com/106826/vegan-mayonnaise-market-higher-mortality-rates-by-2025/) for more vegan products \([plant milks](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/01/22/why-im-switching-from-milk-to-silk.aspx), meat substitutes, etc\) is already causing a [shift in businesses](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/soy-milks-popularity-a-headache-for-dairy-industry-2014-07-19). Animal-based companies worldwide are already profiting in the production more vegan-friendly products \([Unilever](http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/02/hellmanns-very-ironic-vegan-mayo.html), [McDonald's](https://www.mcdonalds.co.za/menuItem/veggie-burger-meal)\) and [new vegan companies are on the rise](http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=6471&catId=8).
1.12.8.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.12.5.1.2.
1.12.8.1.3. Con: Business will adapt as they always do. This move to veganism would come on several generations so there is time for market to adapt and to do the transition.
1.12.8.1.4. Con: One can argue for keeping every industry alive for the sake of jobs, no matter how harmful. Under this premise, we could never achieve progress and change.
1.12.8.1.5. Con: This would be a short term effect and would not \(in and of itself\) make society worse off in the longer term, especially if replaced by other industries which may require more or less labour inputs.
1.12.8.1.5.1. Pro: Ultimately the same amount of food would need to be produced. As such demand for workers in non animal based farming would increase. Varieties of non-animal products would also increase to account for the diversity of products desired by consumers \(think about the variety of crisps or candy currently in the market place\) this would result in emergence of various niche non animal products and related industry. A good example is faux leather made from mycelium.
1.12.8.2. Pro: Countries would be less self sufficient, and thus more vulnerable to global market and diplomatic volatility, in a vegan society because they would depend more on imports.
1.12.8.2.1. Pro: Many vegan staples are [imported from across the globe](https://goodfoodcentre.wordpress.com/2014/10/24/where-veganism-gets-food-security-wrong/). Items such as quinoa, coconut products, palm oil products, avocados, and tropical super foods are yearlong staples for many vegans.
1.12.8.2.1.1. Con: 'Super foods' is not a term specifically used for vegans. The Dutch dietary association gives fat fish as example of a super food, in their critique on super foods, which is obviously not vegan. Vegans can easily live without a fad called super foods.
1.12.8.2.1.2. Con: Quinoa, coconut products, palm oil products, avocados and tropical super foods are not necessary in a vegan diet, they are used for variation and their taste, but that is how they are used by any demographic.
1.12.8.2.1.3. Pro: People would have less choices if food only grows in their country, as not every part of the country might be suited for growing vegan food.
1.12.8.2.1.4. Con: Imported food tends to be less ethical than local food.
1.12.8.2.1.4.1. Pro: People are more likely able to know, see, and act on local food if there are ethical issues with it \(such as cutting into endangered species' land\).
1.12.8.2.1.4.2. Pro: Foods imported to the US tend to utilize animals more in the process \(such as [monkeys to get coconuts](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/10/19/448960760/monkeys-pick-coconuts-in-thailand-are-they-abused-or-working-animals)\).
1.12.8.2.1.4.3. Pro: Many vegan foods have a fair trade label, because one was needed due to the exploits necessitating one for those foods.
1.12.8.2.1.4.4. Pro: Foods imported could have negative associations, such as ['blood avocados' and their relations to drug trafficking](https://www.thefix.com/blood-avocados-and-their-ties-drug-trafficking).
1.12.8.2.1.4.4.1. Pro: This means that money that could go towards peaceful local foods with community end up in the hands of corrupt individuals and organizations \(such as cartels in the article\).
1.12.8.2.1.5. Con: The vegan society is very critical toward the use of palm oil \([vegansociety.com](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/general-faqs)\), so calling it a vegan staple is dishonest as many vegans try to avoid palm oil.
1.12.8.2.1.6. Con: Imported foods tend to be less healthy than local foods.
1.12.8.2.1.6.1. Pro: Imported foods to the US contain more [pesticides](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/emeriti/roberta-cook/articles-and-presentations/imported-vs-domestically-produced-fruits-and-vegetables-there-di/).
1.12.8.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: Countries with [less restrictions](http://www.foodqualityandsafety.com/article/pesticides-in-imported-produce/) create greater pesticide issues.
1.12.8.2.1.6.2. Pro: Imported foods contain or grown around chemicals that are banned in the country taking in the imports.
1.12.8.2.1.6.2.1. Pro: One example is US importing foods from China \([1](https://www.davidwolfe.com/10-foods-china-plastic-pesticides-cancer-causing-chemicals/), [2](http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2014/04/09/truth-about-tilapia.html), [3](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38957549)\).
1.12.8.2.1.6.3. Pro: Imported foods use more food miles, which means those foods are not allowed to ripen on the plant as much as local foods.
1.12.8.2.1.7. Pro: These imported foods, such as [quinoa](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/17/quinoa-threat-food-security-improving-peruvian-farmers-lives-superfood), tend to keep alive ancient cultural foods around in the ever-changing globalized world.
1.12.8.2.2. Con: Living sustainably and in an environmentally-friendly way is not specific to the vegan or non-vegan life-style. Buying more seasonal and local produce is possible for vegans and non-vegans.
1.12.8.2.3. Con: A pressurised economy is a benefit as it can lead to a more positive change in society.
1.12.8.2.3.1. Pro: People would need to get innovative, both on the grower side \(figuring out which vegan foods can be grown locally that people can eat\) and the consumer end \(choosing foods that are not imported\).
1.12.8.2.4. Con: This will not be an issue, as vegan food is grown in [practically every country](https://static.secure.website/wscfus/1897311/uploads/crops_map_fao.png) \(even [similar crops](https://www.targetmap.com/ThumbnailsReports/17660_THUMB_IPAD.jpg) are grown worldwide, so there are no worries about nutritional imbalances\).
1.12.8.2.5. Con: As people become vegan, their new values align with making more local choices in the process.
1.12.8.2.5.1. Pro: One of them is eco-friendly choices. This means that vegans will make countries more self-sufficient by choosing local produce \(like at farmers markets\).
1.12.8.2.5.1.1. Con: Non-vegan options are also available at farmers markets too.
1.12.8.2.5.2. Pro: To avoid cheap labor for goods, people might seek out local artists for innovative faux products \(like clothing and accessories\).
1.12.8.2.5.3. Pro: People within countries benefit for a less globalized economy, because their wages will not be cut by a lower competitor of a country with impoverishing wages.
1.12.8.2.6. Con: In the future, countries are going to be more self-sufficient, as the trends are heading towards there anyway \(mostly independent of veganism\). This means that a vegan society will be more local than the previous one regardless.
1.12.8.2.6.1. Pro: All foods are going to get harder to grow due to climate change. This should not stop people from going vegan. If anything, this pressure will push people to be more vegan, as vegan foods will be easier to grow then than meat.
1.12.8.2.6.1.1. Pro: People are going to want vegan food instead of meat, because people realize meat is a great contributor to climate change.
1.12.8.2.6.1.2. Pro: Vegan food has more options during climate change, because their supply will be less hit-and-miss with the unpredictability of climate change.
1.12.8.2.6.1.2.1. Pro: On [60 minutes](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/seaweed-farming-and-its-surprising-benefits/), a fisherman turned to kelp farming, because the fishing is hard to find \(especially when ocean animals move to seek colder waters\).
1.12.8.2.6.1.3. Pro: Vegan food takes less resources to grow, which will be easier to choose in scarce times \(like low water reserves\)
1.12.8.2.6.1.4. Pro: Plants will be able to [handle](https://www.southernliving.com/home-garden/gardens/drought-tolerant-plants) the hotter weather more than livestock, which will make vegan food a sound decision over meat as the planet warms up.
1.12.8.2.6.1.5. Pro: If vegan foods are grown in vertical farms, they'll help with surviving the new conditions \(as they can be placed anywhere and uses much less resources than current agricultural practices\).
1.12.8.2.6.2. Pro: Local food will be easier to implement when [megacities](http://parisinnovationreview.com/articles-en/agriculture-future-technologies-light) emerge, as farm innovations \(vertical, indoor, and rooftop\) could feed the masses more better than current production methods than the suburban/rural demographics of today.
1.12.8.2.6.3. Pro: The US under the Trump era, advocate and have their goal to reach for emphasizing a local economy.
1.12.8.2.6.4. Pro: Rewilding is a [movement](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/rewilding/human-rewilding1.htm) that could lead to foraging for food \(extremely local\) as lands gain wild plants again.
1.12.8.2.7. Pro: Not every country has favorable [cropland](https://cropmonitor.org/img/about/Synthesis_Crops.jpg) for vegan crops to grow on.
1.12.8.3. Pro: Animal rights organizations go north to Arctic communities and tell the Inuit populations that hunting seal is unethical and morally wrong. These same communities are then expected to [rely on imports from southern regions](https://goodfoodcentre.wordpress.com/2014/10/24/where-veganism-gets-food-security-wrong/) that are outrageously expensive.
1.12.8.4. Con: If all of society was vegan then the cost of specialist vegan food would go down. Vegan food as a whole such as beans, grains and vegetables are already extremely affordable. B12 supplements and fortified foods are also extremely cheap.
1.12.9. Pro: Many humans, especially those in poverty, live in [food deserts](http://www.foodispower.org/food-deserts/). They do not have easy access to the variety of vegetables, fruits, grains and supplements required to sustain a vegan diet as more privileged individuals do distance-wise. Vegan access will still be difficult logistically to work around if the world goes vegan.
1.12.9.1. Pro: Lesser privileged individuals living in food deserts would need to [pay more](https://sendthewholebattalion.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/cost-difference.jpg) for their vegan products, which would become a hardship than those living near them.
1.12.9.2. Pro: Due to the inconvenience, people in food deserts get more [health issues](http://www.foodispower.org/food-deserts/). People there may still go for unhealthy items \(like alcohol and fast food\), even if those options are suddenly veganized, which makes removing these issues difficult.
1.12.10. Con: It's not about privilege but about environment. There are locations where is unfeasible to cultivate the land \(such as desserts or rocky areas\) and to import plant-based foods \([countries with sanctions](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0410/countries-sanctioned-by-the-u.s.---and-why.aspx)\) Only in the case of regions where the land is unworkable and where they import plant-based food, this diet would be more expensive and just for those privileged. Most countries don't face those problems and their populations are or aren't vegans for another set of reasons.
1.12.11. Con: Vegan foods are either the most expensive or the cheapest foods in the world per lb, whereas animal products fall into the middle zone. This makes vegan food more beneficial for everyone: more expensive for privileged individuals and cheaper for less privileged ones.
1.12.11.1. Pro: The [Italian White Alba Truffle](http://most-expensive.com/foods) is the most expensive food in the world at over $48,600 per lb.
1.12.11.2. Con: Even though vegan foods are the most and least expensive foods, some animal products are also really expensive and cheap, thus allowing everyone to enjoy it. Thus, expense should not be an indicator in deciding whether the world should go vegan or not.
1.12.11.3. Pro: The cheapest nutrient/source of sustenance is [water](https://greatist.com/health/44-healthy-foods-under-1), which is vegan and practically free.
1.12.11.3.1. Con: Water alone is not enough to sustain the human body for long periods of time, which would not be an adequate substitute for animal products.
1.12.11.4. Pro: The cheapest food, salt, is vegan, at under [12 cents/lb](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/morton-50-lb-bulk-non-iodized-table-salt/102SALT50.html).
1.12.11.4.1. Con: Salt is very unhealthy
1.12.11.5. Pro: The cheapest food with protein is soft wheat pastry flour, at a little over [21 cents/lb](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/soft-wheat-premium-pastry-flour-50-lb/104SWAN.html).
1.12.12. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.6.5.
1.12.13. Con: The food used to feed livestock, which is then fed to humans, could be used to help feed those harvesting it in third world countries and those who are poverty stricken. Cutting out the middle man, the animals, would provide better energy transferral across the food chain and help solve world hunger.
1.12.13.1. Con: [Grass, leaves and twigs](https://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/resourcesforyou/animalhealthliteracy/ucm255500.htm) that many free grazing animals consume cannot be digested by humans.
1.12.13.1.1. Con: Although maybe not all foods that animals eat can be eaten by humans, but we can reduce food waste by eating parts of food not traditionally eaten to reduce food waste.
1.12.13.1.2. Con: Farmers do not need to grow foods \(like [hay](http://www.johnnyseeds.com/farm-seed/grasses-millets-and-sorghums/)\) that humans cannot eat once everyone goes vegan.
1.12.13.1.2.1. Pro: [Grain-fed animals](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/grass-fed-vs-grain-fed-beef#section1) eat the same foods as humans.
1.12.13.1.3. Con: This is beneficial, because livestock damage the environment through grazing. Without grazing the living parts of plants, plants and ecosystems will be restored.
1.12.13.1.3.1. Pro: Also, the grazing destruction will not continue, because humans cannot consume previously-grazed plants, as they are inedible to them \(like [certain grasses](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_PLANTMATERIALS/publications/mdpmcbr8095.pdf)\).
1.12.13.1.4. Con: Technology may be able to resolve this problem. Researchers are trying to [convert cellulose to starch](https://mappingignorance.org/2013/05/02/cellulose-conversion-to-starch-a-promising-strategy-for-future-global-food-demand/) to make inedible foods edible for humans.
1.12.13.1.5. Pro: A lot of food available to us now through meat will not be available to vegans, due to the lack of converting these plant products to food. [86%](http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/2017_More_Fuel_for_the_Food_Feed.html) of livestock feed's inedible for human consumption.
1.12.13.1.6. Pro: Without getting rid of these excess plant products, they would build up as trash with no use.
1.12.13.1.6.1. Con: These plant products could go towards other, non-food uses, like [compost](http://gentleworld.org/beginners-guide-to-organic-composting/). Individually, grass may become ethanol, leaves may be plates to serve food on, twigs can be shaped into utensils...
1.12.13.1.6.2. Pro: Grass, leaves, and twigs do not decompose in soil efficiently.
1.12.13.1.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.6.3.
1.12.13.2. Con: Starvation does not happen because of lag of food. It happens because the people can either not pay for that food or through war or desaster it is not reaching the local communities. A vegan society will not change that reasons.
1.12.13.3. Con: Even if that where the case, this statement is implying that first world countries that CAN do such large scale farming would be willing to offer huge amounts of food for pennies, or rather charity, [which they are notoriously bad at doing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_development_aid_country_donors). This could only happen if the cost of cultivating crops is lower than the cost of exporting it halfway around the globe.
1.12.13.4. Con: World hunger is caused by politics and not by lack of food nor by lack of arable land.
1.12.13.5. Con: A lot of plants used for animal consumption are not digestible by humans, like grass, hay and corn silage. Animals are fed easy to grow vegetable food whose main carbohydrate is cellulose, which we cannot digest.
1.12.13.5.1. Con: The continuous progress in the field of genetic modification will allow more resilient crops to be produced which can then grow under less-than-ideal conditions where only inedible foods could be grown previously.
1.12.13.5.2. Con: Sustaining a vegan diet needs dramatically less land, so we wouldn't have to use those areas where only inedible food like grass can grow.
1.12.13.5.2.1. Con: To grow all the variety of different plants, vegetables and fruits and nuts to make a vegan diet possible, you need much more land. And this land has to be all over the world \(tropical fruits\).
1.12.13.5.3. Con: This is partly a circular argument, because many of these areas can only sustain "inedible" plants because they were once forests specifically cleared to make room for grazing land, or because years of monocropping has removed most nutrients from the soil. Animal agriculture is therefore also a cause of barren land, not just an answer to it.
1.12.13.5.4. Pro: Most animal food is waste out of the food production, as well as low quality grains that do not meet food standard. Additionally, the plants grown for animal feed are plants necessary to keep the soil fertile in the constant rotation of crops.
1.12.13.5.5. Pro: Animals then convert this indigestible food to useful nutrient that can fertilize food crops.
1.12.13.5.5.1. Pro: Many of the important nutrients found in animals are often not found in plants. And when they are, they are not in the same quantities, and then we need to grow more of them \(defeating the purpose of planting on the basis that it consumes less resources than animals\). And even when we can, it's not metabolically the same as the one we get from animals, which is better suited for our Gastro-Enteric apparatus, see how B12 is less bio-aviable from "alternative sourches" [and it is discouraged](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2000824).
1.12.13.5.6. Pro: Areas where crop feed is grown often cannot support foods that are edible to humans, and is thus more useful for this purpose than otherwise.
1.12.14. Pro: Veganism is [not just](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) abstaining from eating meat but also not using anything which uses animal products. This is an unrealistic standard as animal based products are unavoidable.
1.12.14.1. Con: Animal based products are not unavoidable: from food to clothes, we can get everything we need without exploiting animals. With the increasing number of vegans, vegan products are becoming increasingly available as well. A proof of this is the very fact that thousands of vegans around the world live their life without buying animal products.
1.12.14.1.1. Con: Animal products aren't just used in everyday life but also in [construction](https://www.networx.com/article/animal-ingredients-in-home-improvement-p) and mass production.
1.12.14.2. Pro: Many products people cannot go without contain [animal products](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/products-you-didnt-know-contain-animal-ingredients/) \(including [money](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/11/vegans-are-pissed-that-britains-new-money-contains-meat/) in the UK\), and harming animals is almost [unavoidable](https://www.thoughtco.com/is-there-no-such-thing-as-vegan-127588).
1.12.14.2.1. Con: Vegans understand that 100% animal free living is currently impossible, but reasonable effort to remove impact on animals, within necessity, is still considered living vegan.
1.12.14.3. Con: Even if animal products were unavoidable, veganism advocates [the reduction](https://www.thoughtco.com/is-there-no-such-thing-as-vegan-127588) 'as far as is possible and practicable'.
1.13. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.14. Pro: The meat production industry is itself unethical.
1.14.1. Pro: If you eat meat, you should be the one to perform the killing. This is simply the highest form of taking responsibility for your own actions.
1.14.1.1. Con: Outsourcing tasks can be efficient and cost effective. By having different professions we are able to excel in our own area, be it butcher or farmer.
1.14.1.2. Con: Using that flawed logic, if you want to drive a car you should have to build the car yourself, since by your logic you can't consume a product unless you created it. In this case, the product would be meat.
1.14.2. Con: The vegan agricultural industry is itself unethical too.
1.14.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.3.
1.14.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.
1.14.2.3. Pro: Farmers may take land away from wildlife to farm crops, which is why some species become threatened.  One crop of particular concern is [palm oil](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18775582).
1.14.2.3.1. Pro: Even the [greenhouse gases rising from the deforestation](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/stop-deforestation/drivers-of-deforestation-2016-palm-oil#.WtQJHPkbPIU) contributes to animal suffering.
1.14.2.3.2. Pro: Even though these farmers are not profiting off of animal products \(which is not vegan\), they are profiting at the cost of animals by contributing to their suffering. This way, vegan crops contradict the vegan definition by contributing to the "cruelty of, animals for food"
1.14.2.4. Con: If the production of plant based foods is unethical, then veganism is still the better choice because much more of those plant based products are required to feed livestock than humans.
1.14.3. Pro: [Factory farming](http://visionlaunch.com/factory-farming-pros-and-cons/) is unsustainable, which is bad for the environment.
1.14.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.2.
1.14.3.2. Con: Factory farming of vegetables, for example done in form of  [vertical farming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMzL92bRgEY) is actually really good for everybody, especially for nature. Bill Nye's helper visits the 808 factory in[s3e4, check it on Netflix](https://www.google.fi/search?client=opera&hs=ZqX&ei=f-MYW8nnONHOwAKdmoxw&q=bill+nye+saves+the+world+season+3+episode+4&oq=bill&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.35i39k1l2j0i67k1l8.2957.3537.0.4750.4.4.0.0.0.0.82.317.4.4.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.4.317...0j0i20i263k1.0.8jc9xKxg1XU)
Also [cultured meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultured_meat)-technique is just as sustainable as 808 factory, for Factory farming practices.
1.14.4. Pro: The meat industry affects more lives in an unethical manner than those just being slaughtered.
1.14.4.1. Pro: The agricultural industry is dangerous as there is political corruption leading to environmental defenders and activists being [regularly killed](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/02/almost-four-environmental-defenders-a-week-killed-in-2017).
1.14.4.1.1. Con: This holds for the whole agricultural production, not only of meat and diary, and includes potential vegan foods.
1.14.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.7.
1.14.4.3. Pro: Slaughterhouse employees are not only exposed to a battery of physical dangers on the cut floor, but the psychological weight of their work erodes their well being. Read "Slaughterhouse: The Shocking Story of Greed, Neglect, and Inhumane Treatment Inside the U.S. Meat Industry" and other numerous literature on this matter.
1.14.5. Pro: It's not humans that you have to enforce the law on, it's the meat production industry. It could be made more ethical.
1.14.6. Con: Production methods can be changed to ethical ones.
1.14.6.1. Con: The argument that the meat industry could be more ethical is greatly a weak one because we al know that there is a big difference between 'could be' and 'will be'. Money making is the driving factor behind all this and that should be the target.
1.14.7. Con: The meat production industry being unethical might imply that all humans should become vegetarian, but it does not imply that all humans should become vegan.  The ethics of the meat production industry are only relevant to the ethics of eating meat, not the ethics of eating other animal products.
1.14.8. Con: The reproductive strategy that farmers evolutionarily chosen for livestock \(a.k.a. [artificial selection](http://www.innovateus.net/innopedia/what-are-benefits-artificial-selection)\) that these animals obliged to made them more successful than their predecessors \(outliving them, with like [cattle](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/130401_beef) and [chicken/turkeys](https://www.kent.ac.uk/news/science/3384/chickens-closer-to-dinosaurs-than-other-birds)\) and perhaps any animal within their [taxonomic class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28biology%29) on Earth. This symbiotic relationship is beautiful, benefits both humans and farm animals, and there is no reason to destroy it.
1.14.8.1. Con: The benefits that the livestock receive is due to the fact that more animals die or go extinct to keep these few remaining species alive.
1.14.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.14.1.
1.14.8.2. Pro: Humans realize which genes and traits keep an animal alive and which do not. Without humans, the livestock's evolutionary line might not be here today.
1.14.8.2.1. Con: This evolutionary line is optimized for human needs, not for the animals', for example chickens that can't support their own body weight because of their disproportionately large chests \(due to high demand for chicken breast\). We are not doing them a favor.
1.14.8.3. Pro: Since animals and humans conflict for the same food source, it is more ethical to keep animals around than kill them in order to eat the single source of food. Humans might've realized that early on and went with this decision, which is why livestock breeding is present today.
1.14.8.4. Con: Selective breeding methods in farming did not come without its issues, some of which [negatively impacts the welfare of farm animals](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/media/3816969/modern-breeding-technologies-and-farm-animal-welfare.pdf).
1.14.8.4.1. Pro: Some of these practices were so bad that they lead to emergence of veganism to begin with as well as the whole reason for this debate.
1.14.8.4.2. Pro: Male chicks and calves are not beneficial to the industry \(they can't lay eggs or produce milk\), so most of them are killed, sometimes immediately after birth. We selectively keep the animals that are useful to us instead of allowing them to thrive and reproduce.
1.14.8.5. Con: This is not an example of a symbiotic relationship, since animals do not benefit from it apart from being alive for a short period of time.
1.14.8.6. Con: There is no reason to evolve the other animal rationality because we are already much more evolved.
1.14.8.7. Con: For the food chain, there are already more successful and evolved animals made by nature.
1.14.8.8. Con: Giving life to an individual in order to kill him soon after it is not beneficial.
1.14.9. Con: Killing is unavoidable to produce food. Even for a vegan diet many animals have to die. Deer, wild boar, mice, rats, hamster, birds, insects, … are directly killed to protect the harvest. Whole species are brought to extinction because of taking the habitate from them to grow just one plant.
1.14.10. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.
1.14.11. Con: You can eat local meat and animal products without patronizing any products from the industrial meat production industry.
1.14.11.1. Pro: There are multiple forms of agriculture and organic farming with animal welfare in mind. [Biodynamic agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodynamic_agriculture) is one example.
1.14.11.2. Con: The majority of consumers prioritize the cost and ease of meat rather than the ethics of production. Just because a minority choose to carefully select their produce, does not compensate for a majority who do not.
1.14.11.3. Con: Some situations make that impractical. For instance, industrial meat from developed countries is cheaper than local meat in developing countries, hindering its local meat production if sold there. Economic imbalances can then happen, forcing markets to resort to selling factory over local meat and consumers no choice but to buy factory meat instead.
1.14.11.4. Con: It would not be possible for everyone to eat as much meat as they want without using the meat processing industry.
1.14.11.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.6.1.
1.14.11.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.2.
1.14.12. Con: This is an overly broad generalization. There is even [a list](https://certifiedhumane.org/whos-certified/) of humane producers.
1.14.12.1. Con: Defining humane as:"characterized by tenderness, compassion, and sympathy for people and animals, especially for the suffering or distressed" \([dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/humane)\). Killing perfectly healthy animals just for your preference of taste is not tender or compassionate and shows now sympathy for the animal. There is no way to kill a human humanely., nor an animal.
1.14.12.2. Pro: One can have sympathy for animals and treat them accordingly despite the fact that they are consigned to produce milk, eggs, or meat for human consumption.
1.14.12.3. Con: The abuse, exploitation, and killing of a sentient being is never ethical.
1.14.12.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.
1.14.12.3.2. Con: You can eat many animal products without killing the animal in question, such as milk, eggs, and cheese.
1.14.12.3.2.1. Con: The vast majority of [egg](https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/q/1256/1236) and [dairy](https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/a/1370/1236) production also depends on slaughter.
1.14.12.3.2.2. Con: To produce milk a cow is impregnated by force, made to carry young for 9 months, and their babies are taken away at birth. If male he is killed for veal, if female the cycle repeats. The cow goes through this process over and over until she is "spent" \(usually only a few years as opposed to a long 20 year life\) and then sent to slaughter.
1.14.12.3.3. Con: Plants may be [sentient](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-green-mind/201412/are-plants-entering-the-realm-the-sentient) as well.
1.14.12.3.3.1. Pro: True. There have been studies that show that plants can react to pain, [as this website shows](http://www.collective-evolution.com/2015/05/15/do-plants-respond-to-pain-scientists-conduct-an-experiment-to-find-out/). Furthermore, [they also have been proven to have memory](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-01-09/new-research-plant-intelligence-may-forever-change-how-you-think-about-plants).
1.14.12.3.4. Pro: Killing an animal should be considered murder.
1.14.12.3.5. Con: There is no abuse in those farms. There is no exploitation if we are giving them everything they need for free in exchange for their meat after a paniless death. Killing a sentient being can be ethical in case of Self Defence, Research \(without lab rats we would all die\) and finally Nutrition, given how important it is for Biology and given that a human baby and a Sponge are not on the same level. A Sponge can't even feel pain. So Animal life is not on the same level.
1.15. Con: A vegan diet lacks specific essential nutrients.
1.15.1. Con: In the same way that vegan diets need to be careful about getting the correct nutrients, non-vegan diets also need careful structuring to avoid health complications.
1.15.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.15.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.15.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.15.1.4. Pro: A balanced diet is not dependent on the inclusion or exclusion of animal products or other specific food groups, but on the nutrients it provides - carbs \(energy\), protein, minerals, vitamins and healthy fats. These can be obtained from plant or animal sources.
1.15.2. Con: Some [professional athletes](http://www.greatveganathletes.com/) have shown that it is possible to adopt a vegan diet without sacrificing their athletic abilities or taking too many dietary supplements.
1.15.2.1. Pro: Matt Frazier is an endurance runner who has successfully completed ultramarathons. He does take [supplements](https://www.nomeatathlete.com/supplements/) for Vitamin B12, trace minerals, and EPA/DHA.
1.15.2.2. Pro: [Nancy Clark](http://www.nancyclarkrd.com/), a professional nutritionist, argues that vegan athletes don't always require [supplements](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/can-athletes-perform-well-on-a-vegan-diet/), so long as they adopt a strict training habits.
1.15.3. Con: Many expert organizations agree that a vegan diet can be as healthy as an omnivorous diet.
1.15.3.1. Pro: [According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx), "appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood, and for athletes."
1.15.3.1.1. Con: That same document \(which is [disputed](https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/16/inaccuracies-and-omissions-force-nutrition-society-to-pulls-its-position-statement-on-vegetarian-diets/) within the scientific community\) also claims that vegans will often have to use supplements, and does not deny how sickness is more frequent in them.
1.15.3.1.1.1. Con: The [article](https://retractionwatch.com/2015/11/16/inaccuracies-and-omissions-force-nutrition-society-to-pulls-its-position-statement-on-vegetarian-diets/) also does not say that sickness is more frequent in vegans. Raising bacteria in labs to produce B12 vitamin or algae to produce Omega 3 is as natural as raising cows in industrial farms to produce milk and meat, or raise olive trees to produce olive oil; as for the claim that intakes make a healthy diet more costly, it is unfounded. Finally, any healthy diets require planning.
1.15.3.1.2. Con: A vegan diet might provide all essential nutrients when well planned, but requiring all humans to go vegan \(as the top-level claim states\) will include people who are unable \(skillwise or timewise or from simple forgetfulness and lack of priority\) to plan all meals well. These people will experience malnutrition.
1.15.3.1.2.1. Con: This is just a conjecture.  The opposite scenario is at least as probable: if everybody were vegan, information about healthy 100% plant based diets would be more widespread and even available in schools; vegans would be at least as healthy and informed as they are now. Furthermore, research suggests that lack of vitamins and minerals is not more common among vegans than in non vegans, see for example [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26502280)
1.15.3.2. Pro: [Many](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts.pdf) [dietary](http://www.dietitians.ca) [and](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts.pdf) [medical](https://medlineplus.gov/vegetariandiet.html) [institutions](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx) [endorse](https://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx) properly planned vegan diets as nutritionally complete: British NHS, American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics \(formerly known as american dietetic association\), the British Dietetic Association, the "Dietitians of Canada" association, the American College of Cardiology etc.
1.15.3.3. Pro: According to the [American Journal of Clinical Nutrition](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/5/1627S.full), "Vegans generally have an adequate iron intake and do not experience anemia more frequently than others. Typically, vegans can avoid nutritional problems if appropriate food choices are made. Their health status appears to be at least as good as other vegetarians, such as lactoovovegetarians".
1.15.3.4. Pro: A properly planned vegan diet is perfectly healthy. As stated by [Dietitians of Canada](https://www.dietitians.ca/your-health/nutrition-a-z/vegetarian-diets/eating-guidelines-for-vegans.aspx), the[National Institute of Health \(US\)](https://medlineplus.gov/vegetariandiet.html), the [Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx), the [National Health System \(UK\)](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx), and the [Association of UK Dietitians](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts.pdf).
1.15.3.5. Con: An omnivorous diet in and of itself is not necessarily an optimal one. Comparing the health of the vegan diet to the unhealthy \(on average\) omnivore one means that the vegan diet, at most, will not be that healthy if followed.
1.15.4. Con: This is ironic, as the vitamins that vegans miss \(Vitamin B12, D3, and K2, plus DHA\) but is in meat are actually vegan themselves \(produced by microbes\). Animals just do the work for us by absorb these vitamins into their flesh \(that becomes meat later on\) from the microbes instead of us. Thus, it is not the vegan diet that lacks vitamins, it is just that people make poor \(i.e. microbe-deficient\) food choices on the diet \(omnivores do not have to worry about that\).
1.15.4.1. Pro: Vegans can take in microbes \(that produce these missing nutrients\), so that they stay in the gut lining and survive to produce the missing nutrients.
1.15.4.1.1. Pro: Then, they would not worry about deficiencies or finding the right foods anymore, just like omnivores. Whatever's missing will already be in the vegans' bodies, regardless of what they eat.
1.15.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.
1.15.6. Pro: The nutritional contribution of animal source foods to dietary quality is indisputable as shown by [study](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/133/11/3911S/4818042)
\(chapter "Association between animal source foods and child nutritional status"\).
1.15.7. Pro: Certain essential nutrients, when missing/too low in the diet, creating deficiencies that are harmful.
1.15.7.1. Pro: Vegan diets are at an increase risk of B12 deficiency among other vitamin deficiencies. B12 deficiency alone [can lead to](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vitamin-b12-deficiency-can-be-sneaky-harmful-201301105780) sensory neuropathy and possible permanent neurological damage if untreated. Vegan diets need to be carefully structured or supplemented with vitamins.
1.15.7.1.1. Con: [Vitamin B12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B12#Synthesis_and_industrial_production) is naturally made by bacteria, not animals. For this reason, vegan B12 supplements can be produced easily and cheaply.
1.15.7.1.1.1. Pro: B12 is easy to supplement in various vitamin dense shakes and meals. Also, there exists pill in which a person can intake the essential amount of B12.
1.15.7.1.2. Con: B12 deficiency is not a vegan issue. [The Framingham Offspring study](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/71/2/514/4729184) found that 39% of the general population may be in the low normal and deficient B12 blood level range, and it was not just vegetarians or older people. Most interestingly there was no difference between those ate meat and those who did not. The people with the highest B12 blood levels were those who were taking B12 supplements and eating B12 fortified cereals.
1.15.7.1.3. Con: B12 deficiency is not an issue for informed vegans. Recent [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26502280) results suggest that no significant vitamins or minerals deficiencies affect the vegan population compared to non vegans.
1.15.7.1.4. Pro: The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics warns about the risk of [vitamin B12 deficiencies](https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/vegetarian-and-special-diets/food-sources-of-important-nutrients-for-vegetarians) in vegans. While these can be safely gained from supplements, they are at greater risk.
1.15.7.1.5. Pro: There is a [study that shows that low Vitamin B12 levels during pregnancy](http://newsroom.wiley.com/press-release/alcoholism-clinical-and-experimental-research/avoiding-meat-during-pregnancy-linked-la) set up a worse life \(more prone to drugs\) for their progeny.
1.15.7.1.6. Pro: Without taking synthetically produced goods it is impossible to obtain [sufficient Vitamin B12](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/219822.php) on a vegan diet. The human body cannot source B12 from the sources that herbivores utilise, including bacterial sources. Vitamin B12 is [synthesized](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-001-0902-7) from bacterial sources. It is a reasonably technological enterprise, with a moderate level of industrialisation required.
1.15.7.1.6.1. Con: Only the way that food is grown, processed, and packaged necessitates B12 supplementation. Consider the case of [orthodox Hindus](http://www.biblelife.org/abrams2.htm) who were fine until emigrating to London in the mid-1970s.
1.15.7.1.7. Con: -> See 1.2.20.2.3.
1.15.7.1.8. Pro: Without adequate Vitamin B12 supplements on a vegan diet, people can get [pernicious anemia](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/pernicious-anemia).
1.15.7.1.8.1. Con: Pernicious anemia could happen to those with [medical and genetic risk factors](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/pernicious-anemia) \(vegans are only a small %\). They need to take Vitamin B12 shots, regardless of where the B12 comes from in the diet if their digestive system cannot absorb B12 anymore.
1.15.7.1.9. Con: B12 deficiency is not an issue in the vegan community, as B12 can be easily and efficiently [produced by bacteria](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00253-001-0902-7) in controlled laboratory conditions, B12 is cheap and available, and increasingly present in fortified products \(like vegetable milk\). Raising bacteria in lab cultures to produce B12 vitamins is as natural as raising cattle to produce milk and meat - but surely more efficient and environment friendly than industrial farms.
1.15.7.2. Pro: Vegans are more [deficient](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/82/2/327/4862944) than meat-eaters in the omega 3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. Supplements for these nutrients are usually animal-derived \(the omega 3 fatty acid is found in fish\).
1.15.7.2.1. Con: [Walnuts](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3138/2), [Chia](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3061/2) seeds and [flaxseeds](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3163/2) are are plant sources that are very high in Omega-3. Omega-3 is also present in most vegetables in varying amounts, some good sources are listed [here](https://plenteousveg.com/vegan-sources-omega-3/). And if you want to take a vegan DHA supplement then there are algae derived [options](https://plenteousveg.com/vegan-vitamins/#omega3).
1.15.7.2.2. Con: The Omega-3 acids EPA and DHA are found in algae. This is where fish get theirs. We can eat algae extract which is widely available in pill form.
1.15.7.2.3. Con: Our bodies are able to produce Vitamin D when exposed to the sun. "Vitamin" D is a hormone, not really a vitamin. It's produced by the kidneys. Making this technically yet another cruelty-free source of "vitamin" D3.
1.15.7.3. Pro: Vitamin D3 is [rarely found in plants](https://www.dietitians.ca/Your-Health/Nutrition-A-Z/Vitamins/Vitamin-D--What-you-need-to-know.aspx) and will be inadequate in a vegan diet unless supplemented.
1.15.7.3.1. Con: All diets are poor in vitamin D3: " The paradox with ‘vitamin D’ is that diet per se is usually poor in vitamin D" \([Norman, 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4642156/)\). "The most well-known source of vitamin D is via synthesis in the skin induced by sun exposure." [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4642156/)
1.15.7.3.2. Pro: D3 is inadequate in vegan diets, that is why meat is a good source of D3 \(the livestock gets its source from microbes that produce it\).
1.15.7.3.3. Con: People produce their own Vitamin D from the sun \([1](https://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/cholesterol.php#utilization), [2](https://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/vitamins.php#d), [3](http://www.cholesterol-and-health.com/Vitamin-D.html#figure1)\) and do not need supplementation with this method.
1.15.7.3.3.1. Pro: This source prevents overdosing on Vitamin D \(as seen in the third article\), as the body produces only what it needs.
1.15.7.3.4. Con: There are multiple vegan sources of Vitamin D3.
1.15.7.3.4.1. Pro: [Vegan vitamin D3](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-d) supplements are sourced from lichens. They are especially beneficial for vegans who stay too long indoors.
1.15.7.4. Pro: Getting enough protein on a vegan diet can be challenging.
1.15.7.4.1. Pro: Vegan protein sources are not as high-quality, meaning they do not contain complete essential amino acid profiles. The protein-rich foods also contain fibres and anti-nutrients like lectins that lower the absorption of the amino acids. For example the [digestibility](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3905294/) of whey is 100%, whereas the digestibility of black beans is 75%.
1.15.7.4.1.1. Con: Contrary to popular belief, [any legume](https://vegetarianism.stackexchange.com/a/1404/1236) can completely satisfy human amino acid requirements, either eaten alone or with other whole plant foods. The necessity of protein combining is a myth.
1.15.7.4.2. Con: Even in developing countries and for all ages, sources of protein and amino acids and their protein quantity is [shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10466163) not to be an issue.
1.15.7.5. Con: Omnivore diets are not as nutritious anymore as they used to because livestock's food is sanitized, which prevent microbes from creating nutrients that adds to livestocks' meat \(such as [B12](http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/carnivores-need-vitamin-b12-supplements/2013/10/30)\).
1.15.7.5.1. Con: Farmed meat is not the only meat available. Free-range and hunted animals are still an option.
1.15.7.6. Pro: Iodine is [not consistently available](https://veganhealth.org/iodine/) from plant foods.
1.15.7.6.1. Pro: A study of [Boston-area vegetarians and vegans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21613354/) found that U.S. vegans may be at risk for low iodine intake.
1.15.7.6.2. Pro: A study of [London-area vegans](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/iodine-intake-and-iodine-deficiency-in-vegans-as-assessed-by-the-duplicateportion-technique-and-urinary-iodine-excretion/546E13105E5CFF1D9A01C116658B09C4) found the probability of iodine deficiency disorder was moderate to severe among vegans who were not consuming seaweed.
1.15.7.6.3. Con: Table salt is [iodized in many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodised_salt) because iodine deficiency is recognized as a public health concern among many people, not just vegans.
1.15.7.6.4. Pro: Dairy is a consistent source of iodine, partly because dairy cattle [are given iodine feed supplements](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iodine-HealthProfessional/) and iodine solutions are used to clean the teats of milking cows.
1.15.7.6.5. Con: Iodine is available in supplements, such as the [VEG 1](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/veg-1-frequently-asked-questions-faqs) multivitamin sold by The Vegan Society UK.
1.15.7.6.6. Con: In countries like the Netherlands iodine shortage in all food is simply solved by supplementing bread. This could also be done to other countries and with other food types [\(Voedingscentrum: Iodine Netherlands\)](http://\(http://www.voedingscentrum.nl/encyclopedie/jodium.aspx\)).
1.15.7.6.7. Con: High amounts of Iodine are naturally present in seaweed, which can be [cultivated](https://www.wur.nl/en/article/Sustainable-seaweed-cultivation.htm) in nearly every country with a coastline. Seaweed could simultaneously a provide a good source of protein for large populations.
1.15.7.6.8. Con: A normal Western Diet often also lacks essential nutrients like [jodium](http://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-krijg-ik-voldoende-jodium-binnen-.aspx) \(iodine\).
1.15.8. Con: A vegan diet also lacks unnecessary and harmful nutrients that animal products contain.
1.15.8.1. Pro: A vegan diet [lacks dietary cholesterol](http://www.diagnosisdiet.com/diet/vegan-diets/) - the main cause of [heart disease](https://www.pcrm.org/health/medNews/cholesterol-levels-lower-in-vegans): the [#1 killer](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death) worldwide.
1.15.8.2. Pro: Vegan diets also contain a lot less heavy metals and pollutants.
1.15.8.3. Con: -> See 1.2.8.1.
1.15.8.4. Pro: It is better to lack nutrients and be able to supplement them than place dangerous ones in the body and try to remove them before it is too late to.
1.15.9. Con: Animal products lack specific essential nutrients too, like [Vitamin C](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/report?nutrient1=401&nutrient2=&nutrient3=&&max=25&subset=0&offset=7100&sort=c&totCount=7123&measureby=g). This is no reason then not to go vegan.
1.15.10. Pro: -> See 1.10.3.
1.15.11. Con: These can be supplemented.
1.15.11.1. Con: Supplements cost money, which may not be affordable to the less privileged.
1.15.11.1.1. Con: The [money saved from healthcare expenses/loss of life](http://time.com/4266874/vegetarian-diet-climate-change/) could go towards paying for supplements.
1.15.11.1.2. Con: Most people pay for supplements anyway when eating meat, so this should not be an issue.
1.15.11.1.3. Con: Since meat is [generally more expensive](https://plenteousveg.com/cost-vegan-protein-vs-animal-protein/) than vegan food \(outside of processing\), the savings could be transferred towards buying supplements.
1.15.11.1.3.1. Pro: Savings could be even greater without cooking, as vegan foods can be eaten raw, whereas meat needs to be cooked \(outside of rare instances like pre-cooked meat, jerky, and meat just taken out of an animal\). The savings come from no cookware, fuel to cook with, or safety issues from mistakes.
1.15.11.1.4. Con: Vegans might not need too many supplements if they eat a nutritious diet.
1.15.11.1.5. Con: If people eat cheaper vegan food, then they can budget their money towards supplements.
1.15.11.1.6. Con: Vegan foods and supplements will get cheaper with more people buying them, so this will not be an issue.
1.15.11.1.7. Pro: Supplements cost money and without being able to pay for them, vegans could run into costly health issues
1.15.11.1.8. Pro: Supplements require educating the public about what to use. If this is not provided in school, then only the more privileged can afford to educate themselves on what supplements to buy instead of experimenting \(which is costly\).
1.15.11.2. Con: A diet requiring supplementation, that does not supply essential nutrients is not a complete and healthy diet.
1.15.11.3. Pro: Modern society provides the means to supplement these nutrients via cruelty-free production methods based on lab-bred bacteria.
1.15.11.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.15.7.1.1.
1.15.11.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.15.7.3.4.
1.15.11.3.3. Con: Robust scientific evidence based research is virtually non-existent to prove that these alternatives and supplements can be correctly absorbed by the human body and what effect do they have on people using them in the short and long term. There is a huge difference between in-vitro testing, long term scientific studies, and reality.
1.15.11.3.3.1. Con: Science has identified the exact chemicals vitamins and minerals are made of, and many of them can be synthesized in a lab. They are thus chemically identical to their naturally-occuring counterparts.
1.15.11.3.3.2. Con: Supplementation to combat common nutritional deficiencies \(which are by far not exclusive to vegans\) has long been a standard practice in medicine and even food science \(for example, iodized table salt has greatly reduced iodine deficiency\). There is no reason to believe that supplementation is not an effective treatment for deficiencies.
1.15.11.4. Con: Supplements are unnatural.
1.15.11.4.1. Con: Unnatural is needed, as humans created and live in an unnatural world that necessitates unnatural behaviors
1.15.11.4.2. Con: Just because they are unnatural does not make them bad or not necessary.
1.15.11.4.3. Con: Pretty much any diet these days is unnatural, due to living in a post-agricultural revolutionary era
1.15.11.5. Pro: Vitamin K2, found in [natto](https://veganhealth.org/vitamin-k/), could be supplemented \(from natto\) for those who do not have access to that food.
1.15.11.6. Con: -> See 1.2.12.
1.15.11.7. Pro: A vegan diet contains pretty much all of the nutrients required, the small few not provided can be easily supplement if its not already done so.
1.15.11.8. Con: Supplements are not available in all countries and not accessible to all humans.
1.15.11.9. Con: Acknowledging that nutrient supplements are readily available for vegans, raises the point that they are merely supplements and not completely authentic substitutes for natural sources of nutrients.
1.15.11.9.1. Pro: Some pills make uptake of supplement nutrients more difficult than getting it from food sources.
1.15.11.9.2. Con: Some supplements are a better source of a nutrient \(due to a higher bioavailability or correct balance of nutrients\), so it is better to supplement, no matter what diet a person's on.
1.15.11.9.3. Con: People are not always able to balance their food intake to make sure they get enough of everything and take a multivitamin because of that, regardless of diet.
1.15.11.10. Pro: Some supplements are better than natural sources, because they are not attached to food, as with [B12](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/).
1.16. Con: Humans evolved to eat meat and, as it's in our nature, we cannot and should not change.
1.16.1. Pro: Removing humans from a strong predatory position would disrupt the current ecosystem. The weaker species would become overpopulated, unable to care for their volume and potentially spread disease to land used for plant growth.
1.16.1.1. Con: If the overpopulation becomes an issue \(pushing a species to extinction\), then humans could find vegan methods to manage wildlife populations.
1.16.1.1.1. Pro: One method to cull is relocating a species \(checked for potential issues\). The benefits are two-fold: 1\) the population decreases in the original location and 2\) the population can survive and thrive in the new place
1.16.1.2. Con: [Natural selection](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hunting/game-handling/selective-culling2.htm) will correct for species' overpopulation eventually.
1.16.1.2.1. Pro: Humans for the most part removed the top predator from ecosystems \(such as [killing sharks for soup](http://www.stopsharkfinning.net/shark-fin-soup-whats-the-scoop/)\). Once humans become vegan, the top predators \(that are not extinct\) will probably come back and replace humans' top position \(as we have done with them\).
1.16.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.7.4.1.
1.16.1.4. Pro: This is similar to the effect caused by the decrease in wolf numbers [increased the deer population](http://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20081023/SPORTS/810230378).
1.16.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.16.1.2.1.
1.16.1.5. Con: Humans, being the strongest predator in the ecosystem, cause \(rather than prevent\) so much damage that this discussion needed to be created \(to explore the possibility of removing humans from this position to prevent further impacts\).
1.16.1.5.1. Pro: Most of the human-style culling \(removing a predator that is a threat to humans through hunting\) causes the exact problems that top predators supposedly prevent.
1.16.1.5.1.1. Pro: Humans removing a top predator \(like [sharks](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/sharks-how-a-cull-could-ruin-an-ecosystem)\) disrupts the ecosystem.
1.16.1.5.1.2. Pro: Removing the top predators prevents those animals from keeping other species populations in check. Then those species get overpopulated anyway \(such as [sea urchin populations due to overfishing](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110114164516.htm)\).
1.16.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: These overpopulated species [wreak havoc](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110114164516.htm) on the ecosystem.
1.16.1.5.1.3. Pro: Hunting is generally not a good mechanism for regulating animal populations. In some cases it causes [species extinctions](https://www.britannica.com/list/6-animals-we-ate-into-extinction).
1.16.1.5.1.3.1. Con: Are there any examples of hunting to extinction from within the last century? We have learned a bit since then and understand about sustainable yields.
1.16.1.5.2. Pro: Humans artificially created domestic breeds for their purpose only \(not for the environment\). If humans lost their top predatory position, domestic species would cease to exist eventually \(through natural selection\). Although this transition is a disruption to the ecosystem, it is a positive and necessary action to make the environment better than its current condition.
1.16.1.5.2.1. Pro: Most of the meat eaten is not from hunting, but from industrial farming. Industrial farming is now disrupting the ecosystem.
1.16.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.14.3.
1.16.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Farming is not an example of normal predation.
1.16.1.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: Most land animals killed for meat consumption are raised specifically for that purpose. Livestock farming does not help regulate animal population.
1.16.1.5.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Arguments against livestock farming do not make arguments for blanket veganism.
1.16.1.5.2.1.2.2. Pro: This is true when the only predator is homo sapiens. A wild herd is not comparable to an intentionally bred one, as most habitats have multiple natural predators.
1.16.1.5.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: A farmer is a predator that both breeds and kills you, which is not comparable to a predator killing already existing animals in the wild for food, for its survival.
1.16.1.5.2.1.2.2.2. Con: For some animals, such as [deer in the UK](http://www.countryfile.com/explore-countryside/wildlife/deer-culling-britain-facts-and-statistics), humans do act as the top predator and are needed to control numbers.
1.16.1.5.2.1.2.2.3. Pro: Farming is not normal predatory behaviour because it exceeds and replaces natural predator activity.
1.16.1.5.2.1.2.3. Pro: While referring to predators in nature \(e.g. a lion or a wolf\) this claim "might" have its sense. When this claim is referring to humans as the "predator" then it doesn't make sense. There is no "selective predator role" in intensive animal farming \(e.g. chickens or pigs\). Every "product" is produced, genetically selected, and killed to be eventually sold on the supermarket shelves.
1.16.1.5.2.1.2.4. Pro: The top predator is always present in the animal kingdom, in accordance with the ecosystem. Humans have built systems outside of ecosystem, so outside of natural predators.
1.16.1.6. Pro: What would we do with all the remaining livestock on farms if we became vegan right now? The reproduction of the herd wouldn't stop and the excess of animals would be very harmful to nature if they are released into the wild.
1.16.1.6.1. Con: The government stipends towards meat can be shifted to funding sanctuaries for remaining livestock.
1.16.1.6.1.1. Pro: In combination with stopping further breeding of livestock, sanctuaries will prevent livestock from harming nature while maintaining peaceful lives.
1.16.1.6.1.2. Pro: The stipends could the temporarily pay for farmland until the livestock live out their lives completely instead of being released into nature.
1.16.1.6.2. Con: Livestock already exist in nature \(like grazing cattle\). Farmers will just need to keep managing the population \(like preventing overgrazing\) to not impact the ecosystem.
1.16.1.6.3. Pro: Some livestock cannot be released into the wild. For example, large numbers of feral pigs have threatened [historical sites](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2013/06/14/rooting-history-feral-swine-damage-archaeological-sites) in Florida.
1.16.1.6.3.1. Con: Some livestock could be released into the wild. This could actually be a positive \(like restoring [wild horse populations](https://rtfitchauthor.com/2009/10/03/1216/)\) rather than a negative.
1.16.1.6.4. Pro: Current livestock would not be killed and instead live [longer](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/94/33/13/943313e0f11805e1cbc4cecacfc1ed10.jpg) and more fruitful lives. While this is a benefit to the livestock, their lives add to the population when reproduction continues. This can make livestock populations continue its pace \(even without human intervention it could still reach its projected [100 billion](https://youtu.be/7gXq1ml6B1E?t=1m16s) mark\), which could cause difficulties in managing them.
1.16.1.6.5. Con: The lives of livestock would be threatened, as [their food source would go towards humans to live](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat). This will negatively impact the reproduction of herds.
1.16.1.6.5.1. Pro: Adding to this, since more people will thrive in this transition, the surplus could lead to more people with jobs of controlling the remaining herds.
1.16.1.6.6. Con: In nature, livestock's populations will be at the whim of natural selection. This will control any overpopulation issues.
1.16.1.6.7. Con: The transition of a vegan planet might not happen overnight, which prevents these issues from arising.
1.16.1.6.7.1. Con: Even in small numbers, an animal like a pig that doesn't produce any product beneficial to humans \(or make a good pet\) will have difficulty surviving.
1.16.1.6.7.1.1. Pro: In Texas, wild pigs were not prevalent until [1980ish](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-plague-of-pigs-in-texas-73769069/).  Considering the idea of wild is simply an escaped domestic pig, the numbers have grown so large that the pigs cause problems for the Texans- eating the crops, destroying property.  Pigs populate quickly even in nature.
1.16.1.6.7.1.2. Pro: Wild pigs are destructive, costing the U.S. an estimated [$1.5 billion](http://blogs.plos.org/ecology/2017/02/01/invasive-wild-pigs-leave-a-swath-of-destruction-across-u-s-and-they-keep-spreading/) each year in damages and control costs.
1.16.1.6.7.1.3. Pro: In 2014, reports showed the USDA is spending [$20 million](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-wild-pigs-ravaging-the-u-s-be-stopped/) to solve a pig problem that has spread to 39 states and counting.
1.16.1.6.7.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.16.1.6.3.
1.16.1.6.7.2. Pro: Even though reproduction would not stop, it would slow down dramatically \(since human intervention artificially inflates populations: through artificial breeding\).
1.16.1.6.7.3. Pro: Over time, the livestock will decline \(farmers will just sell what they have and not grow more\) until a lack of supply and demand cause them to cease existence. Thus, no livestock would be left to place into the wild and would not be an issue.
1.16.1.7. Con: We eat the meat of farmed animals, not wild animals. So if we stop eating meat and stop animal farming, it won't affect wildlife because we do not take from their population to begin with.
1.16.1.7.1. Pro: Except for rare and highly-regulated hunting and eating roadkill for food, people are not the top of wildlife's food chain.
1.16.1.7.2. Con: If the [30%](https://greenerideal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vegan-environment.jpg) of land that goes to farm animals gets returned to wildlife, they might have a chance of overtaking us. Eating farm animals decreases the risk of humans getting removed from its top predatory position.
1.16.1.8. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.7.10.3.
1.16.2. Con: The fact that there are many people alive today that don't eat meat should refute the claim that we cannot or should not change.
1.16.3. Con: Eating meat is not in our nature. Everyone is born a vegetarian, but get into eating meat is through parental choosing \(around [4-6 mths old](https://www.babycenter.com/404_when-can-my-baby-eat-meat_1368509.bc)\) and cultural conditioning reinforcement later \(see TV advertisements for [fast food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIsX2PGi5IY) and [lunch meals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrWtXvI1kaU)\).
1.16.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.5.1.
1.16.3.2. Pro: Young children are born with a natural aversion towards harming animals \(except in [rare circumstances](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-human-equation/201104/children-who-are-cruel-animals-when-worry)\), including due to [fearfulness](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080227121840.htm). They get [conditioned](https://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/is-it-normal-for-your-preschooler-to-hurt-animals/) by people around them later on to act differently towards animals. Having less sympathy towards animals probably prepares them to be less cautious towards eating meat \(even though animal aversion is in our nature\).
1.16.3.3. Con: As humans are conscious beings for the sake of argument, no one can be technically be called vegetarian at birth. This is because babies cannot decide what they eat. One could make the argument that kids shouldn't eat vegetables because they don't naturally like them, but that wouldn't make much sense. In any case babies only gravitate "naturally" towards breast milk but that's about it, any other claims are completely subjective.
1.16.4. Con: Just because it is in our nature, does not make it healthy. We developed a [craving for sugars, because it was scarce in the past](http://theconversation.com/how-the-diets-of-early-humans-explain-our-eating-habits-46481). We should not cater to our nature, just because it is innate, because it can cause us harm instead.
1.16.4.1. Pro: Since our meat-eating tendencies are different today \(we used to hunt for food\), we set ourselves up for disease \(like heart disease\) if we continue what is in our nature.
1.16.5. Con: This is a contradiction, because evolving to eat meat means that humans did change. Saying we cannot and should not change does not make sense, as the only reason why humans eat meat is because we changed. If we really cannot/should not change, we should just eat the largely plant-based diet of our ancestors \([1](http://www.becominghuman.org/node/news/diet-australopithecus-sediba), [2](http://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/anthropology/science-paranthropus-boisei-tiger-nut-diet-01680.html)\) instead, before they evolved to eat meat.
1.16.6. Pro: We [evolved to eat meat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2qdyKxU0YU&t=715s) and our body [processes meat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIRurLnQ8oo&t=105s) a lot better than vegetables or other fats, which makes us sick
1.16.6.1. Pro: It's not wrong for an individual who experience health benefits from meat to act in his/her own interest and eat meat.
1.16.7. Pro: Without animal protein, we wouldn’t even have [become human](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16990)—at least not the modern, verbal, intelligent humans we are.
1.16.7.1. Pro: Both the teeth and intestinal tract of humans are similar to other omnivores.  Human teeth are similar to pig teeth, for example, and very different from both herbivore and carnivore teeth.

Humans and pigs both have incisors, canines, and \(bunodont\) molars. Herbivore molars are usually a lot less rounded, and full of ridges for grinding plants. Carnivores have sharp teeth that work together like scissors to cut meat.

[www.quora.com](https://www.quora.com/What-type-of-teeth-do-omnivores-have)
1.16.7.2. Pro: Evolution clearly shows that the more we evolved, the more meat we ate, and the correlation between brain evolution and meat intake is well known in science.
More primitive primates will be more frugivurous. More evolved primates will preferr meat. This switch is verified from Habilis to Erectus
[abc.net.au](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/11/22/1514032.htm)
1.16.7.3. Con: There's no reason to believe that meat made us intelligent, since the process of both aquiring and making meat edible through cooking required a high degree of intelligence in the first place.
1.16.7.3.1. Con: Earliest [evidence](http://discovermagazine.com/2013/may/09-archaeologists-find-earliest-evidence-of-humans-cooking-with-fire) of cooking dates back 1 million years, where [meat consumption](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/evidence-for-meat-eating-by-early-humans-103874273) dates back more than 2.5 million years. Most of our [brain growth](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-has-human-brain-evolved/) has happened in the past 2 million years.
1.16.7.3.1.1. Con: The link between brain growth, intelligence, and eating meat is [questionable](http://discovermagazine.com/2010/sep/25-modern-humans-smart-why-brain-shrinking) at most. Correlation does not equal causation. Meat-eating lacks proof of causation for intelligence.
1.16.7.3.1.1.1. Pro: Although the brain growth from meat might be why humans became intelligent, brain growth could also come from a larger muscular structure from hunting \(as seen with [Neanderthals](http://discovermagazine.com/2010/sep/25-modern-humans-smart-why-brain-shrinking)\), which we do not have now \(even though we still eat meat\).
1.16.7.3.1.1.2. Pro: Human brains have been shrinking for the [past 20,000 years](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-have-our-brains-started-to-shrink/), even though we are becoming more intelligent and probably eating more meat than ever. It is just that we do not need to hunt for meat and intelligence comes externally rather than internally now with computers and the internet.
1.16.7.3.1.1.3. Pro: The climb of intelligence started [10M yrs ago](http://www.rupestreweb.info/mimesis.html), long before we ate meat. Intelligence is often mistakenly attributed to meat-eating, since their co-occurrence could be coincidental \(meat-eating started when intelligence exponentially exploded, around [2.6M yrs ago](http://nmnh.typepad.com/100years/2015/03/early-humans-could-have-scavenged-from-lions-lunches.html)\).
1.16.7.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: Intelligence really took off when we started walking upright, around [6M yrs ago](http://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/brains). After [2M years](http://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/brains), new environments and climate change intellectually stimulated our brains, which caused further growth. So walking upright and changing environment\(s\), not meat \(although meat was there\), lead to brain growth.
1.16.7.3.2. Pro: Humans first ate meat [using tools](http://nmnh.typepad.com/100years/2015/03/early-humans-could-have-scavenged-from-lions-lunches.html). The intelligence to make tools did not originate from eating meat.
1.16.7.3.3. Con: The acquiring of meat at this time has no relation to how meat made us intelligent. Humans likely ate leftover carcasses that other animals killed themselves, which requires, but not much intelligence. It was only after eating meat that our brains grew larger, fostered later by cooking.
1.16.7.4. Pro: The development of human cognition and brain was [greatly advanced](https://www.livescience.com/24875-meat-human-brain.html) in evolution as meat consumption increased \(especially when [cooked and pounded](https://www.npr.org/2010/08/02/128849908/food-for-thought-meat-based-diet-made-us-smarter)\).
1.16.7.4.1. Pro: Eating meat caused humans to evolve smaller guts to send energy to the brain faster. This was great, because our larger brains now use [20%](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/evolution-of-diet/) of our body's total energy intake.
1.16.7.4.2. Con: [With cooking, digestible starches](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280735260_The_Importance_of_Dietary_Carbohydrate_in_Human_Evolution) \(pg 253\) continued the rise of brain growth when meat could not. This accelerated our brain size increases faster than meat did \(during the Mid-to-Late Pleistocene\).
1.16.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.15.4.
1.16.7.6. Con: That is not the entire story. In fact, without plants, we would not be the modern humans we are.
1.16.7.6.1. Pro: We evolved [smaller jaws and saliva to break down starches](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/evolution-of-diet/) to eat plants.
1.16.7.6.2. Pro: One hominid, paranthropus boisei, had around an [80%](https://www.ibtimes.com/nutcracker-man-diet-extinct-species-early-human-survived-tiger-nuts-not-meat-1535834) diet of tiger nuts \(not meat\), which supported a large brain around [2.4-1.4M years ago](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2536015/Ancient-ancestors-ate-diet-tiger-nuts-worms-grasshoppers.html).
1.16.7.6.2.1. Pro: Even though it went extinct, so did all hominid species except the homo sapiens of today. It was not due to their plant diet being insufficient for them.
1.16.7.6.2.2. Pro: Tiger nuts allowed humans to survive for [1M years](https://www.ibtimes.com/nutcracker-man-diet-extinct-species-early-human-survived-tiger-nuts-not-meat-1535834) of climate change.
1.16.7.7. Con: Since [meat remains survive better than plant ones](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280735260_The_Importance_of_Dietary_Carbohydrate_in_Human_Evolution) \(pg 255\), it is difficult to really know what diet made us human without the complete picture.
1.16.7.8. Con: While it is true that being able to digest a variety of foods has been an evolutionary advantage; many of our closest relatives \(primates\) are entirely herbivorous. If meat was the only driving factor of evolution, other omnivorous or carniverous animals would be ahead of us. It is more likely that the use of tools and fire allowed humans to surpass other animals.
1.16.7.9. Con: Our history should not determine our future and while we were in need of meat in the past, this doesn't justify a need in the present.
1.16.7.10. Con: Whether or not that is true, we do not need it now.
1.16.7.10.1. Pro: People who don't live in regions where food is scarce don't have a problem getting enough calories and protein. In fact, most people easily take in too much, as is shown by increasing rates of obesity in the developed world.
1.16.7.11. Con: With modern knowledge of what humans require for a healthy diet, there is no longer a dietary argument for the consumption of meat. The fact that humans historically have benefited from it is irrelevant to the question of how we should live today, and there is no proof that consumption of meat will lead to a better or healthier humanity in the future: quite the opposite.
1.16.8. Pro: The simple truth is that human nature will never allow this to happen - too many people enjoy eating meat and animal by-produce and too many people survive on it for this to be a serious proposition whether it is scientifically sound or not.
1.16.8.1. Pro: Regarding the reduction of violence towards animals, veganism can never become the mainstream solution for the majority of humans because it simply conflicts too strongly with our omnivorous nature. Other solutions \(such as cultured meats\) are more viable since they don't require the same unintuitive changes in dietary behavior, thus reducing animal violence while also allowing the majority of humans to actually adopt it.
1.16.8.2. Con: Whether or whether not making all humans vegan is possible is irrelevant. The important part is, *should* all humans be vegan.
1.16.8.2.1. Con: Ethic is, by definition, the practical part of Philosophy. It can't just be theoretical. You have to decide what is right and wrong based on what can be done. Yes, theoretically everyone \(including children\) should have fought a dictatorship, but this is impractical and thus suggesting it would be unethical. Thus if human nature prevents humans from being vegan it is unethical to suggest they should be.
1.16.8.3. Con: Before slavery was abolished "too many" people enjoyed the luxuries of cheap labour for it ever to be removed. Veganism is a social movement. The whole premise of a social movement is that things can be changed.
1.16.8.4. Pro: Perhaps ideally all humans should be vegan. But it is akin to asking "should humans stop being jealous?" Some conduct- because it is sociobiological, or innate-is beyond our capacity to change through an authoritarian measure.
1.16.9. Pro: Humans are naturally omnivores, with a preference to eating meat. We should not stray away from our nature.
1.16.9.1. Con: The length of our digestive system is just like of many other herbivores. Without fire we couldn't eat meat too, so it can't be natural.
1.16.9.1.1. Con: Humans can eat and digest raw meat, but often cooking makes it more flavorful.
1.16.9.1.2. Con: Our digestive system is actually of a length and structure similar to that of many other omnivore and opportunistic species, and many people worldwide survive well with a diet that includes raw meat \(but not only raw meat, in most cases\).
1.16.9.1.3. Con: Actually, we could eat meat raw.  It's just that it's not as safe to do so; after all, cooking meat kills the bacteria that could find us a tasty host... and cooking improves the flavor quite a bit \(especially with a nice white wine and some oregano\).  In fact, there are relatively few animals that cannot be safely eaten by humans.  The same cannot be said for plants.
1.16.9.1.4. Con: Animals like humans [cannot eat](https://www.geek.com/science/geek-answers-why-can-animals-eat-raw-meat-but-we-cant-1593883/) raw meat without the possibility of health issues. However humans can still and do eat raw meat.
1.16.9.2. Con: Nature does not offer all the right choices and answers.
1.16.9.3. Pro: There is [much evidence](https://www.npr.org/2010/08/02/128849908/food-for-thought-meat-based-diet-made-us-smarter) in paleoanthropological science that the size of human brains \(i.e. large in relation to body size\) is related to the subsistence strategy adaptation of meat and seafood eating in the Old World, as far back with our genetic ancestors as Austrolopithecus \(perhaps the first stone tool user, as some have reasonably argued\).  We cannot foresee the neurophysiological consequences of resorting to centuries of veganism \(reverting to a more primate-like dietary strategy\).
1.16.9.4. Pro: While this [Scientific American article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-humans-eat-meat-excerpt/) primarily is focusing on mass-scale livestock ranching issues, it makes it clear that humans are biologically omnivores, and that this omnivorous nature is part of what allowed humans to develop the way they had.
1.16.9.5. Con: There is no preference to eating meat, we are socially conditioned to prefer eating meat, which isn't exactly the same thing.
1.16.9.6. Con: This argument is an example of the [is–ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is–ought_problem). What *is* doesn't justify what ought to be.
1.16.9.6.1. Con: If we don't base "oughts" on existing context, then what should we base them on?  One could argue that a human ought to take their dietary requirements from water, soil, and the sun, thus no longer needing to kill animal or plant life, but that's hardly a realistic context.
1.16.9.7. Con: The "preference to eating meat" part is disputable as humans are actually opportunistic [omnivores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMOjVYgYaG8&feature=youtu.be) and evolved to adapt to the availability of food \(which in some cases meant a primarily plant based diet\). Even if this were true, though, it would be irrelevant as a [properly](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts.pdf) [planned](https://www.dietitians.ca/Downloads/Factsheets/Guidlines-for-Vegans.aspx) [vegan](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx) [diet](https://medlineplus.gov/vegetariandiet.html) is perfectly [healthy](https://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx).
1.16.9.8. Con: Humans belong to the great apes \(hominids\) - which includes chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, bonobos - all of which eat plant based diets.
1.16.9.9. Con: We live in a modern society, were we take medicine and eat preservatives. Nothing is natural.
1.16.9.10. Pro: "There is evidence that hominids were making tools and [eating meat](https://www.sapiens.org/body/early-humans-and-raw-meat/) as far back as 3.3 million years ago—and that they increased their meat consumption around 2.6 million years ago—yet evidence for cooking doesn't turn up until about 500,000 years ago."
1.16.9.10.1. Con: Humans also managed to create nukes, weapons and bombs, is there any evidence we should pursue in this way. If we do something it doesn't mean we should pursue it.
1.16.9.10.1.1. Con: Not relevant to the origins of people eating meat. Though, these tools have already adapted make the killing of animals more humane.
1.16.9.10.1.1.1. Con: In some cases regulations for 'humane' slaughter is ignored and there is evidence of abuse in many abattoirs which claim to follow those standards.
1.16.9.11. Con: [Humans are omnivorous](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/omnivore/). They evolved to be able to eat a lot of different things, including meat and dairy products. But there are actually still [a lot of humans that are not able to process lactose](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/539wy5/it-took-humans-5000-years-to-evolve-the-capability-to-digest-dairy). Humans also evolved into compassionate beings that can decide what to eat and what not. Evolution is, therefore, not a good argument.
1.16.9.11.1. Con: The human body is designed for a herbivorous diet \([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wG3b3ql34A), [2](http://meatyourfuture.com/2015/09/herbivores-carnivores/), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmXynDLkbXY)\): teeth, jaw movability, digestive colon & saliva properties
1.16.9.11.1.1. Con: Humans are actually omnivores \(anatomically\). There are two types of mammalian herbivore GI tracts, one with multiple stomachs \(like ruminants: [cows](http://slideplayer.com/slide/4687656/)\) or one stomach but large cecums \(like lagormorpha: [rabbits](https://oercommons.s3.amazonaws.com/media/courseware/openstax/m44736/Figure_34_01_05ab.jpg) or rodents: [mice](https://giorgiafiorio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Rat-Anatomy-Organs-diagram-ideas-Diagrammatic-representation-of-the-internal-organs-of-a-rat.jpg)\). Humans are like the latter, but have small cecums \(vestigial appendix\). Thus, the human GI tract does not resemble those of herbivores, but instead omnivores like [bears](https://blackbearsofnorthamerica.weebly.com/anatomy.html).
1.16.9.11.1.2. Con: Apes \(which humans evolved from\) all are mostly plant-based with some animal supplementation. This makes them omnivores \(or "mostly herbivore"\), not [herbivores](https://www.livescience.com/53452-herbivores.html). This is seen in [gorillas](https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-do-gorillas-eat-and-other-gorilla-facts), [chimpanzees, bonobos](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/c/chimpanzee/), [monkeys](https://animalcorner.co.uk/animals/old-world-monkeys/) \(Old World - for human taxonomy\) humans. Only [55 million years ago](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/diet-and-primate-evolution-2006-06/) was there a carnivorous primate \(insectivore\).
1.16.9.11.1.3. Con: Not all humans are truly herbivorous in their anatomy. Some humans [evolved to consume milk](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/070401_lactose), due to genes allowing them to digest lactose.
1.16.9.11.1.4. Pro: Most ancient civilizations were built on a plant\(s\) as a staple crop \(like [corn](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs141p2_015559.pdf) for the Hopi, [three sisters](https://www.thoughtco.com/three-sisters-american-farming-173034) of Native Americans, and [mongongo nuts](http://www.beyondveg.com/tu-j-l/raw-cooked/raw-cooked-3g.shtml) for the !Kung Bushmen\).
1.16.9.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.
1.16.10. Con: We are not bound to do what we did in the past.
1.16.10.1. Pro: Just because something is natural does not mean that it is good. This is the [naturalistic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy).
1.16.10.1.1. Con: A diet that fits human’s metabolism is guaranteed to provide all the nutrients we need.
1.16.10.2. Pro: Changing diet is not hard for humans, since we are the most adaptable species on the [planet](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/humans-may-be-most-adaptive-species/).
1.16.10.3. Pro: The whole point of evolution is to change. If we evolved to eat meat, then we can sure can evolve to eat a vegan diet as well.
1.16.10.3.1. Con: In an ecosystem, [survival of the fittest](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/survival+of+the+fittest) involves not only evolution, but also [adaptation](http://www.differencebetween.net/science/nature/difference-between-adaptation-and-evolution/). Because evolution will not be fast enough for human survival, adaptation is the other option to use. Thus, even though veganism is not in our nature, we need to achieve it behaviorally to adapt to climate change.
1.16.10.3.2. Pro: In the past, humans evolved to eat meat due to dietary gaps. Now we have the opposite problem. We need to evolve away from eating meat due to dietary abundance \(as with obesity and health conditions from too much meat\).
1.16.10.3.3. Pro: Evolution predates humanity and civilisation. Jainism \([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism)\) and other beliefs offer different perspectives. Humans evolved in caves, yet very few people want us to go back and live in them.
1.16.10.3.4. Pro: As we no longer live in a survival state, we don't need to eat meat to have an healthy diet respectful of other living creatures. Moreover, high-protein diets such as the one followed by [Inuits](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/neal-barnard-md/eskimo-myth_b_5268420.html) exposes them to heart diseases issues and a short life expectancy contrary to diets using less meat such as the [Okinawan](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/19/japanese-diet-live-to-100) diet which enables people to live over 100. \([www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc23vYwPihU)\)
1.16.10.4. Pro: Just because we have done something for a long time does not mean it is good.
1.16.10.5. Pro: Early modern humans ate mostly [mammoth, along with antelope, horses, and deer](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170804082912.htm). The meat we eat is different today, as some of these animals are extinct. To say we cannot and should not change does not make sense, as we had to evolve even our meat-eating tendencies to keep it in our nature.
1.16.11. Con: There are no need to use animals, we are at a higher level technologically.
1.16.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.4.1.
1.16.11.2. Pro: Humans have the potential to bypass evolution through genetic editing. Thus, we can genetically edit our DNA for us to become vegan to not worry about the pitfalls of our meat-eating nature not letting us change.
1.16.11.3. Pro: Following our nature would make sense if the meat created today is natural. However, meat today is unnatural in production and processing \(with colouring, flavouring, and GMOs\).
1.16.11.3.1. Pro: Unfortunately, the world we live in is not natural, so adaptation to the new, modern environment is better than not changing at all \(even if that is most people's preference\).
1.16.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.
1.16.11.5. Pro: Numerous substitutes already exist for traditionally animal-derived products.
1.17. Con: Veganism is incompatible with some cultural beliefs and practices.
1.17.1. Con: The current meat industry is incompatible with cultural beliefs and traditions. It is incompatible with [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhabihah), [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shechita), [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_dietary_laws), and [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_in_Hinduism)
1.17.1.1. Con: The meat industry being incompatible with cultural, or religious, values is not an argument to justify veganism. Instead it is a justification for making the meat industry more religion-friendly.
1.17.1.2. Con: There are plenty of options for people of various faiths. Halal groceries, hunting, back yard farming are all reasonable options.
1.17.1.3. Con: Ethical slaughter has very little to do with being vegan. Ethical slaughter is a different discussion, which is where this argument belongs.
1.17.2. Pro: In Christianity and Jewish religion [eating a lamb at Easter/Pesach](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+12&version=NIV) is a several thousands years old tradition which symbolises the saving power of God.
1.17.2.1. Con: Just because some cultures in the bronze age used to do something does not make it a "good" or "helpful" practice thousands of years later. There are other ways to remember religious events.
1.17.2.2. Con: There is no reason this couldn't be a symbolical lamb if the nature of this act is already symbolical.
1.17.2.3. Con: Substitutions can be made so people can still carry out their traditions. Faux lamb could be used instead of lamb to keep the traditions going.
1.17.2.3.1. Pro: Many religions already make substitutions in their practices \([pg 3](https://books.google.com/books?id=XKrjyQTlJWsC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=substitutions+of+religious+rituals&source=bl&ots=VvirFGHL28&sig=VHEWPWQ6sYqBQimolOgCmyfwyVs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigoIeA9v_dAhUnzoMKHcs3AQwQ6AEwA3oECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false)\), which the religion allows for. With such flexibility, vegan substitutions should be possible and accepted, because of such commonplace that already takes place. If nobody can notice the difference in the substitution, then there is no reason not to use it.
1.17.2.4. Con: If we need to ditch religions to go vegan, then it is a worthwhile venture. These religions will still be around for people to study academically, so we can move forward by eliminating the practice of it.
1.17.2.4.1. Pro: By then, people most likely will not practice religion anyway, as religious participation is declining [worldwide](http://By then, people most likely will not practice religion anyway, as religious participation is declining worldwide.). So an academic setting in the future will be best after all to preserve the past without losing it, but also having a 'happy medium' where people do not participate in it if they do not want to.
1.17.3. Pro: If all humans would become vegan the humanity would lose a big part of its culture. In the same way that some people e.g. engage in medieval practises it would be desirable e.g. for historians that at least a small group of humans would keep these animal-based culture alive.
1.17.3.1. Con: Perfomative art and studying cultural heritage is possible without actually continuing to kill and eat animals. Just like people don't actually wage war or keep slaves for the sake of historical reenactment.
1.17.4. Con: Slavery was a cultural practice in the west. By the above argument, slavery should still be morally acceptable in the west.
1.17.5. Con: Cultures can preserve their practices by making substitutions with vegan ones without compromising its practices.
1.17.5.1. Pro: Even if cultural practices are lost from veganism, the cultures can be documented and preserved to practice the vegan parts when desired.
1.17.6. Con: Veganism is not the largest threat to culture. Cultural beliefs and practices are getting lost anyway to modernism, so the veganism conflict with cultures would not happen anyway in the future.
1.17.6.1. Pro: Globalization is a bigger threat to the loss of cultural practice than veganism is.
1.17.6.2. Pro: Many younger people do not want to pick up cultures and traditions, because they want to be a part of modern civilization. Thus, people actually want to be a part of veganism more than their cultural traditions.
1.17.6.3. Pro: There will come a time when the only way to learn about a culture is through documentation \(like in textbooks and museums, just like how many ancient civilizations are known these days\) rather than the people in it. Thus, we should focus on these forms of documenting while cultures are still around instead of their inevitable threats.
1.17.7. Pro: Academic and laboratory research, some fields more than others, like biology, rely on [animal testing and experimentation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/peta-study-finds-animal-testing-in-federal-labs-on-the-increase/) to write research papers. Many academics, scientists, and industries would lose grants, funding, and jobs if everyone went vegan.
1.17.7.1. Con: The public does not favor animal testing, so the majority of people will be happier with the world going vegan, especially when there are [alternatives](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319016413001096).
1.17.7.2. Pro: The pharmaceutical industry in the US would not exist right now without animal testing, as it is part of [drug research process](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm143475.htm).
1.17.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.
1.17.7.3. Con: While veganism strives to reduce animal suffering wherever possible, it would be a gradual development and not an overnight shock. We can start with food, where we already have many satisfactory alternatives, and worry about animal testing when we have more efficient ways \(e.g. better computer models\) for testing in biology.
1.17.7.3.1. Pro: Also, in a vegan world, animal testing might not exist due to its ineffectiveness. Instead, drugs would just be given to humans and weeded out based on how the public reacts \(known through doctor visits and such\).
1.17.7.4. Con: The pharmaceutical industry would decrease anyway in a vegan world. The population would be healthier due to the new diet, needing less medications than ever before.
1.17.7.5. Con: In-vivo/observational academic/research fields may increase due to veganism, rather than decrease, due to the lack of disruption that veganism causes to the world.
1.17.7.5.1. Pro: If wildlife can survive and thrive, there will be opportunities in studying it that are not possible before. This can range from learning about the wildlife itself to the tourism trends it creates.
1.17.8. Pro: Many cultures have deeply rooted, specific traditions with respect to foods and animal products. Imposing veganism imposes a western/dominant interpretation of animal wellbeing, ethical perspective, and relationship to food. This would worsen trends towards suppressing or eliminating nonwestern/nondominant cultures.
1.17.8.1. Con: Non-western cultures eat way less animal products, which is the main problem with western civilization.
1.17.8.2. Con: This discussion is not about forcing people to act, but the best way to act. Tradition is [not a reason](http://yvfi.ca/tradition) to perpetuate actions if they are morally wrong. For example, slavery and considering women inferior to men have been traditional views for millennia in many cultures. It is obviously unrealistic to expect a sudden change, but it is not unreasonable to think it can happen.
1.17.8.3. Pro: In [Mi’kmaq culture](https://humanrightsareanimalrights.com/2015/04/03/margaret-robinson-indigenous-veganism-feminist-natives-do-eat-tofu/), the killing of a moose symbolized a boy’s entry into manhood. So when you challenge the hunting traditions, you’re challenging how Mi’kmaq men understand their masculinity.
1.17.8.3.1. Con: There's nothing wrong with challenging cultural beliefs.
1.17.8.3.2. Con: Challenging cultures that are unethical is more important than preserving traditions.  For instance tiger body parts and elephant tusks are a common ingredient in Traditional Chinese Medicine but have been outlawed.  Other cultural traditions include owning people as slaves.
1.17.8.4. Con: Cultural traditions centered around meat \(like hunting, ritual slaughter for certain spiritual / religious events\) are not the main focus of veganism. Although vegan ethics would dictate the abolishment of such practices, the vegan movement is currently more concerned with animal agriculture on a large, global scale. A small native tribe owning a herd of goats is a relatively small problem and vegans are not trying to take away animals from people who actually depend on them.
1.17.8.5. Pro: Some specific religious activities are incompatible with veganism.
1.17.8.5.1. Pro: [Animal sacrifice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sacrifice) is a component of some current religious practice.
1.17.8.6. Con: Many non-Western cultures are vegan or vegetarian.
1.17.8.6.1. Pro: Veganism need not be seen as a Western cultural trait. Similar ideas can be found in non-Western countries, notably [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism_by_country#India).
1.17.8.6.2. Pro: Veganism is not strictly a western dominant interpretation. For example, followers of [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_vegetarianism), [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_in_Hinduism), and [Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_vegetarianism) advocate vegetarianism in their culture, believing that humans should not inflict pain on animals.
1.17.8.6.3. Pro: Many non-Western cultures, such as the Okinawans and Hunza, eat plant-based diet.
1.17.8.6.4. Con: In South Korea, for example, it is quite difficult to stay on a vegan diet as meat, fish and egg is very prevalent. For example, the stock for any Korean soup consists of dried anchovies.
1.17.8.6.4.1. Con: As our understanding of umami \("meaty taste"\) and which compounds it's made of is constantly growing, we can develop good-tasting ways for making broth, condiments and sauces that don't require the use of animal flesh.
1.17.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.17.8.6.4.
1.17.9. Con: Just because something is a cultural practice or deeply believed doesn't make it right or ethical. Ethics should always be more important than culture, tradition or beliefs.
1.17.9.1. Con: Ethics are made by cultures, they aren't just hanging in the air. Each cultures have theirs own ethics, and they are different. It's possible that something is ethical in one culture but unethical in an other. Even in the West, liberal ethics are opposing with conservative-Christian ethics in many questions \(e.g. marriage, abortion, war, etc.\), these are two different cultures coexisting, and when one tries to force its ethics to the other, it's something against human rights.
1.17.10. Con: [Appeal to tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition) is a logical fallacy.
1.17.10.1. Con: This is not an appeal to tradition, because it simply states the fact, without asserting that this should be the standard.
1.17.10.2. Pro: Tradition is superseded by logic and scientific discovery.
