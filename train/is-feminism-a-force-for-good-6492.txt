Discussion Title: Is feminism a force for good?

1. Feminism is a force for good in the world.
1.1. Con: Feminism is a divisive force in society.
1.1.1. Con: A new social concept almost always brings division which doesn't make it unworthy of implementation, slavery abolition in U.S. being the best example.
1.1.1.1. Con: Slavery was not a social concept.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Slavery was certainly a social norm.
1.1.2. Pro: Increasingly feminism has been dividing groups up by status and potential victim risk, this in turn creates a situation where feminists actively decry others in an attempt to look more puritanical than their peers.
1.1.2.1. Pro: This has fostered a divisive atmosphere where groups are pitted against each other in an attempt to be more virtuous and victimised than their peers.
1.1.2.2. Con: For the conflicts described in the above claim, all parties are ostensibly trying to do good but merely disagree about what is best. These conflicts don't escalate to the point where it would offset good of their original goals.
1.1.2.3. Con: Groups have always been divided by [status](http://www.thefinertimes.com/Middle-Ages/social-classes-in-the-middle-ages.html).
1.1.2.4. Con: Feminists don't care about being puritanical.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Feminists as a group are [neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_views_on_prostitution) about prostitution because some see it as a male dominance thing, while other's see sex and selling and buying of sex as a valid view for both men and woman to have.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: People, including woman who shame other woman or any person for being fringed or sluts are seen as anti feminists, to the point where feminists are preforming [slut walks](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2017/09/amber-roses-slutwalk-controversial-feminist-movement-still-relevant).
1.1.3. Con: Third wave feminism is an [extremist](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/04/curious-case-third-wave-feminists/) form of former ideologies which has been more divisive than previous iterations. It is unfair to define all of Feminism as divisive.
1.1.3.1. Con: While third wave feminists are almost exclusively in the spotlight in social discourse, without getting called out by other feminists, it is entirely fair to make the claim, that this is indeed feminism today.
1.1.4. Pro: The most active branch of feminism is third-wave feminism which has been cited from non-feminists to be [hostile](https://twitter.com/kimberlyfroth/status/1029871155207761922), and has even been labeled as [toxic](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/18/feminism-rosetta-scientist-shirt-dapper-laughs-julien-blanc-inequality) because it focuses on shaming men publicly for sexist acts rather than focusing on the main issues behind some of these actions, which would be toxic to society as a whole.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Feminism puts men in a position where they are fearful of women in the [workplace](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11904203/Well-done-feminism.-Now-man-are-afraid-to-help-women-at-work.html). [Male college professors, and powerful business men](https://nypost.com/2015/05/26/why-powerful-men-now-hide-behind-open-doors/) do not trust having women in their classrooms and offices alone without the door open, for fear of a visit to HR, or a lawsuit accusing them of something.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Men who don't sexually abuse woman have little to fear.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Even men who sexually assault woman often won't face consequences.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Woman are [unlikely](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-compassion-chronicles/201711/why-dont-victims-sexual-harassment-come-forward-sooner) to report sexual assault.
1.1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Being charged with sexual assault doesn't seem to have hard consequences.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: [False accusations](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45565684) are usually for woman to cover up things such as pregnancy, or for an emotional gain. The fear men have is irrational if they aren't doing anything creepy.
1.1.4.2. Con: Whist there are people considered to be toxic feminists, they are no where near the majority of people who claim to be feminists. It is even argued that [toxic feminism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Toxic_femininity) is not a real thing.
1.1.4.3. Con: We should judge feminism based on feminism, not what people think about feminism.
1.1.5. Con: It is divisive only in its extreme form, trying to replace patriarchy with matriarchy, going beyond equality
1.1.6. Con: Feminism can't be blamed for being "divisive" or "adversarial" because society and the sexes were more divided and adversarial before the time of feminism. More feminist women and men are in agreement on feminist issues now, than when sexist beliefs were dominant in society. This unity is only growing, with more and more people understanding the finer points of true egalitarian society. The entrenched, recalcitrant sexists who make the exception should only be blamed on themselves.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Complaining about people's legitimate concerns should not be encouraged.
1.1.7. Pro: Feminism promotes [anti-family](https://medium.com/\@NikitaCcoulombe/why-feminism-wants-to-dismantle-the-family-long-4695d45bcf88) policies and perspectives because feminists often claim that marriage and child-rearing are wound up with patriarchy.
1.1.7.1. Pro: Prominent feminists such as [Linda Gordon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Gordon) have made anti-family [statements like](https://medium.com/\@NikitaCcoulombe/why-feminism-wants-to-dismantle-the-family-long-4695d45bcf88): “the nuclear family must be destroyed… Whatever its ultimate meaning, the break-up of families now is an objectively revolutionary process.”
1.1.7.1.1. Con: There doesn't seem to be any proof that she said that. The links provided link to a dead end article. Though other sources also quote her with the claim, the internet is known for [repetition of false claims.](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2017/11/18/traffic-jam-in-china-behind-viral-posting-of-mass-desertion-of-cars-in-germany/)
1.1.7.1.2. Con: We do not have the context of the statement and so could misinterpret what she meant. Quotes can be interpreted [differently](http://ttp://www.susanbrownmiller.com/susanbrownmiller/html/against_our_will.htm) if we have the half sentence before the conjunction, or better yet the entire paragraph.
1.1.7.1.3. Con: Historically the nuclear family is not [universal](http://oregonexplorer.info/content/how-family-structure-has-changed). So the concept of alternatives to the nuclear family are not anti-family.
1.1.7.2. Con: It would be illogical for feminists to be [anti-family](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/03/myths-stay-at-home-moms/).
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Some Feminists argue that by choosing to get married and have a children/family, that women are making the wrong choice and "betraying the cause" and enabling the oppression of the patriarchy. This is anti-choice unless that choice corresponds with their own goal and world view.
1.1.7.2.1.1. Con: A large majority of feminists disagree.
1.1.7.2.2. Pro: Some Feminists argue that by choosing to get married and have a children/family, that women are making the wrong choice and "betraying the cause" and enabling the oppression of the patriarchy. This of course, taken to its ultimate extreme \(no breeding\) would result in the extinction of the species, so is clearly an illogical view and stand point.
1.1.7.2.3. Con: Some [feminists](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1021293/How-mothers-fanatical-feminist-views-tore-apart-daughter-The-Color-Purple-author.html) do believe women should get jobs and work, and take up the fight for equality, instead of getting married, staying at home and having and [raising kids](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/02/housewife-feminist-baby). They do not believe it is possible, or even desirable to do both. Some have even speculated this is the reason women are marrying later/older and having children later in life, as well as less children.
1.1.7.2.3.1. Con: Encouraging woman to work is not a bad thing.
1.1.7.2.3.2. Con: This is not being anti-family, but pro freedom.
1.1.7.2.3.2.1. Con: It is possible to claim to be both.
1.1.7.3. Con: The world is becoming overpopulated anyway.
1.1.7.3.1. Con: Anti-family does not stop breeding or the population growth rate, just the traditional family stereotype and structure.
1.1.7.3.2. Con: Even if this assertion is accepted as true, population growth or even stability is important for society and the species.
1.1.7.3.3. Con: Taken to its logical extreme, this statement has troubling moral and ethical implications.
1.1.7.4. Con: Popular feminist media outlet, [Everyday Feminism](https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/03/myths-stay-at-home-moms/), promotes that stay at home moms should be supported by feminism.
1.1.8. Pro: Feminism causes men and women to view each other as adversaries - or worse, enemies - instead of promoting cooperation and mutual thankfulness.
1.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.1.8.2. Con: Only a sexist person could cause hate from a discussion of feminism. i.e. a female trying to gain more rights, falsely using feminism as the reason, or a male wanting more rights and blaming feminism for getting in their way. \(Or reversed roles.\) Real feminists won't find this problem with other feminists.
1.1.8.3. Pro: A prime example of this consequences is the [Mgtow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVXdxaaRiAU) idea, which is, as they sell it, is no less than self preservation that would have never happened had feminism never happened
1.1.8.3.1. Con: Sociopathy, bitterness and consideration of women as sub-humans existed before feminism; There's no way to predict that these peoples' "MGTOW" behaviors in a feminist society are any worse than how they would have adapted to a society where women had fewer rights and had to stay "in their place". The redirection of guilt from them onto feminism is absurd.
1.1.8.4. Con: Feminism is the only way to successfully promote lasting cooperation and mutual thankfulness, because true gender equality is a prerequisite to such things.
1.1.8.5. Con: As [Robert Franken’s](http://www.male-feminists-europe.org/can-men-feminists-male-point-view/) article argues, men can be feminist and -as evident by the article itself - some are.
1.1.9. Pro: As feminism has grown more popular and powerful, average women have been becoming [less happy.](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp09-11bk.pdf)
1.1.9.1. Con: If true, this fact supports the enduring relevance of feminism. It certainly does not prove that feminism is the cause of women becoming less happy.
1.1.9.2. Con: Correlation is not causation.
1.1.9.3. Pro: Thanks to feminism, women now have a choice between either having a family, having a career, or balancing both - which can be challenging for women to manage.
1.1.9.3.1. Con: If women are stressed about balancing family and career it is because men are still not sharing equally in the [responsibilities at home](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/09/27/women-chores-home_a_23224733/). It is not the choices that cause women stress, it is patriarchy and archaic gender roles.
1.1.9.3.2. Con: Men also have these problems, but are less likely to be personally castigated for how they make those same choices.
1.1.9.3.3. Con: This could be false equivalence. Capitalism could be argued to be the source of sufferage in combination with patriarchy.
1.1.10. Con: Feminism has brought hundreds of thousands of women from all sorts of demographics and walks of life together in [protests and marches](http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,2088114,00.html), united by a common goal.
1.1.10.1. Con: Many of these protests and marches did not have a coherent cause or goal, causing these women to come together for a variety of reasons that are not unified.
1.1.10.1.1. Pro: A perfect example is the [Women's March](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/women-march-protests-thousands-rally-trump-180120195621901.html), held shortly after President Trump's election and again in 2018. Participants' reasons for marching varied wildly, with some protesting the defunding of Planned Parenthood, others unequal pay, some for the environment, and even a "Handmaid's Tale" group hoping to prevent fiction from becoming reality.
1.1.10.1.1.1. Con: The underlying theme that unites all of these causes is an opposition to the values and proposed policy lines that the Trump administration threatened to take, which would negatively affect the life of women across the country.
1.1.10.2. Con: Protests and other gatherings are amassing of one group against another, which can be perceived as divisive despite the perceived unity within one or more groups.
1.1.11. Pro: Feminists can be exclusionary to different groups of women due to the amount of ideological infighting within it as a movement.
1.1.11.1. Con: Everyone has disagreements about the best way to do something when they are passionate about a cause. This doesn't show feminism preventing its own success, only that it isn't a magically perfect execution.
1.1.11.2. Pro: Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists \(TERFs\) exist.
1.1.11.3. Con: This is like saying that Nazis were nice because a few of them were nice, similar to another [point](https://www.kialo.com/is-feminism-a-force-for-good-6492/6492.0=6492.1-6492.138+6492.201-6492.240-6492.413-6492.1393/-6492.1393) made. Groups that large will often have internal conflict, but there's a seems to be a trend trend that most feminist support mens rights for equality, the right to abortion and equal respect for transgenders.
1.1.11.4. Con: Not all feminists believe those claims.
1.1.11.4.1. Con: That's true, but the claim isn't that all feminist have these beliefs. Rather, the claim is that feminism as a sociological movement has these beliefs.
1.1.11.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.3.
1.1.11.5. Con: There is no substantial evidence that this claim is true about the majority of feminists, or the overall movement.
1.1.11.5.1. Con: This exclusion happens systemically and at prominent feminist events such as the [Women's march](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/01/17/pro_life_feminist_group_new_wave_feminists_removed_from_women_s_march_partnership.html).
1.1.11.6. Pro: [Pro-life women](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/01/17/pro_life_feminist_group_new_wave_feminists_removed_from_women_s_march_partnership.html) often find themselves excluded from Feminist movement.
1.1.11.6.1. Con: Feminists are actually fighting for pro-life women's rights in spite of the pro-life women fighting against their own right to have a choice. It's not "in-fighting" when one party is acting directly in opposition to the mission. Pro-life women are perfectly capable of joining in other feminist ventures when they keep boundaries between that and their anti-feminist activities.
1.1.11.6.2. Con: This seems like it was more a matter of wanting to avoid having Pro-Life signs/coalitions/chants at an event that overwhelmingly disagrees that this falls under the umbrella of "feminism" or "women's rights". Pro-life women could go but they couldn't push that agenda while they were participating.
1.1.11.7. Pro: [Sex workers](http://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/1131368/womens-march-in-dc-sex-workers) are often excluded from the feminist space.
1.1.11.7.1. Con: Sex workers are often included in the feminist space. Sex workers are often excluded in a patriarchal space. Has an anti-feminist community ever treated sex workers well?
1.1.11.8. Pro: Feminism often demonstrates intolerance of differing views to the point of ostracism and [intentional exclusion](https://nypost.com/2017/12/29/how-the-feminist-left-let-women-down-in-2017/).
1.1.12. Con: There is no clear correlation between divisiveness and righteousness.
1.1.12.1. Pro: Obama was a pretty divisive force in society. So were Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Oppenheimer, Einstein, Caesar, etc.
1.1.12.2. Con: An individual may perceive their own self-righteousness \(moral certainty\) as righteousness \(moral integrity\). Those that flaunt their “moral superiority” and over-ride other essential morals are not righteous.
1.1.12.3. Pro: Many societal changes create division as seen throughout history; like abolishing slavery and the de-segregation of race. Just because it is divisive doesn't mean it's bad or not worth the effort.
1.1.13. Pro: Feminism often defends misandrists and misanthropes like [Donna Hylton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hylton), who was invited to speak at the International Women's March, despite being convicted for murder and torture. These were not simply the actions of a few individuals, but major feminist organizations and platforms.
1.1.13.1. Con: Donna Hylton had served her sentence, and once served most moral systems allow rights like freedom of speech to return.
1.1.13.2. Con: Bad ideas/actions of individuals in a group are not representative of the group itself, unless that group endorses those ideas/actions.
1.1.13.2.1. Con: If this discussion were about those groups, the same critique would be applied. But it isn't.
1.1.13.3. Con: It's unreasonable to expect every individual of a movement to catch every instance of malpractice by 'official groups'. One mistake should not be cause for dismissal of an entire movement that has been historically necessary. If this truly happens often, please provide more examples.
1.1.13.4. Pro: Many self-professed or claimed feminists are actually [Misandrists](https://percolately.com/alexa/funny-feminist-tweets-2/?utm_content=inf_10_4134_2&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=GTAK&tse_id=INF_84396610d7a511e8871cc5c94d0ec567&fbclid=IwAR0RG0_h_FwSbMhrXL25hmOO43n4WiH3ZgNDhanCHPYSc0DFC5iUzFDKAy0), and use feminism as a thin veil for the misandry.
1.2. Pro: [Feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism_and_equality) is trying to slow down [the 'war' against woman](https://www.gq.com/story/the-republicans-war-on-women-is-a-clear-and-present-danger).
1.2.1. Pro: The war on woman includes [disinformation campaigns](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/12/reasons-people-believe-feminism-hates-men/) against feminism.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Anti feminism groups such as [womenagainstmen.com](http://www.womenagainstmen.com/media/feminism-is-a-hate-group.html) use [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com) and false claims to try and discredit feminism. For example, looking extreme feminists with points of views that nearly every other feminist would disagree with. They then use the [Fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition) to falsely claim that is what all feminists are like.
1.3. Pro: There are still groups trying to reverse legal protections for women's rights that have only existed since the previous century. Even if one were to posit that there is not one more women's right needed, it is feminist just to keep things from going backwards.
1.4. Pro: Feminism adds a new perspective to conventional views on social and political issues.
1.4.1. Con: New perspectives don't necessarily mean good perspectives.
1.4.1.1. Con: In feminism's case it can mean good perspectives, as shown by the [pros](https://www.kialo.com/is-feminism-a-force-for-good-6492/6492.0=6492.1+6492.19) inlined with the parent.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Equality, a perspective generally held by feminists, is morally good.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: [Feminism helps to make a more equal society.](https://www.kialo.com/is-feminism-a-force-for-good-6492/6492.0=6492.1+6492.181/+6492.181)
1.4.2. Pro: Most works of art or[literature](http://thegreatestbooks.org/) that are heralded as expressing a 'human condition' or 'human tragedy' feature almost-exclusively male protagonists, meaning they are limited to expressing a male's experience of it. Feminist writings offer the other half of the story.
1.4.2.1. Con: Equating Feminism with femininity is a false equivalency. Feminism is not needed in order to add female voices to the mix.
1.4.2.2. Con: Given that less than half of women in Western countries consider themselves feminists, it can be argued that feminism really doesn't represent women.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Women benefit from feminism even when they don't claim it. For example, at one point, [90% of women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_Opposed_to_Woman_Suffrage#/media/File:Household_Hints.jpg) opposed women's suffrage. We're all pretty grateful now, though.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: [Polls](https://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8372417/feminist-gender-equality-poll) in the US suggest that as few as 18% of women there call themselves a feminist. This is despite more than two thirds of women in the country supporting equality of the sexes.
1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: Polls may simply indicate a lack of understanding. In this case, if polled citizens are not aware of the various facets of feminism, they may be hesitant to consider themselves members of the movement.
1.4.2.2.2.2. Con: Some feminists avoid using the word "feminist" to describe themselves as a way to avoid peoples' prejudice against feminism, and to give their ideas and actions a chance to be evaluated on their own merit.
1.4.3. Pro: By raising the status of women in society, feminism reduces the influence of '[toxic masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_masculinity)'.
1.4.3.1. Pro: As the status of women in society is raised, so is the influence of female perspectives.
1.4.3.2. Pro: As women gain greater influence and respect in society, misogynistic attitudes become less tolerated and accepted in society.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Misogynistic and homophobic attitudes portrayed by men are generally considered elements of ['Toxic Masculinity'](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/news-events/calendar/toxic-masculinity).
1.4.4. Pro: Feminists offer cultural critiques, from a feminist perspective on art, movies, television and other cultural phenomena, helping us better understand them.
1.4.4.1. Con: Feminism has failed to portray the character that is "woman", but rather insists that women adopt and portray themselves with more masculinity, which does not artistically resonate with the masses nor resonate intuitively with women in general.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: This assumes a very binary masculine/feminism divide, which is not accepted by all feminists.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: There are groups of feminists, such as [lipstick feminists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_feminism), who actively shrug off conventional 'masculinity'.
1.4.5. Pro: Some feminist texts are considered classics that have contributed to our understanding of societal, political and philosophical issues.
1.4.5.1. Con: Some feminists texts discuss the value in killing all [men](https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://kunsthallezurich.ch/sites/default/files/scum_manifesto.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjLztSY483bAhXsDMAKHbm7A1MQFjAPegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw07Axup7FlO1H25rb5YfV9i), reducing male [population](http://www.azquotes.com/quote/598052), and otherwise harming men.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: As an example of both blaming men 100% for a problem and suggesting harm to men as a solution, here is one feminist tweeters take on the [situation](https://www.georgetakei.com/moms-blistering-rant-about-why-men-are-to-blame-for-all-unwanted-pregnancies-goes-viral-2605669198.html?utm_content=inf_10_4221_2&tse_id=INF_83ee8650ba9911e8872dc93302272904).
1.4.5.2. Pro: Cynthia Enloe added a [feminist perspective to international relations theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananas,_Beaches_and_Bases) when she focused on the role of military bases, diplomats' wives or backlashes to nationalism.
1.4.6. Con: Feminist perspectives on socio-cultural issues have a propensity to point out sexism or female injustice where it does not exist.
1.4.6.1. Con: In these cases there often is sexism but it is very difficult to see as a man or someone who is not accustomed to seeing these issues
1.4.6.1.1. Con: Through a certain lens or world view, many actions can be interpreted as sexist, regardless of intent. This may speak more to the mentality and world view of the interpreter than whether something is actually sexist or not.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Pro: Example: Person A of one gender, comments on or compliments Person B of the other gender in a genuine manner. Person B however takes offence and feels the comment is sexist or made it a condescending or otherwise lecherous manner with ulterior intentions, motives or subtext. Person B has now interpreted the action or comment as sexist when no such intention or subtext was meant.
1.4.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: In the above example, it may speak more to Person B's world view and mind-set then the reality of the situation, as they have attributed and attached extra meaning, motivation or context than actually exists or is intended, imposing their own world-view and agenda on the actions or words of Person A. It is person B who is giving it weight and turning it into an issue where otherwise none would exist.
1.4.6.1.1.2. Con: An action can be sexist even when it wasn't its intention
1.4.6.2. Con: Not feminism, but a fraction of feminists promote false ideas.
1.4.6.2.1. Pro: There are many different feminisms, so criticisms should be directed to specific ideas by name, rather than feminism as a whole, otherwise they will be beating at 'straw effigies'.
1.4.6.2.1.1. Con: Whilst there are variations within the movement and some fringe extremists, there are broad beliefs and popular ideas that come from mainstream feminism: as such, the movement can be criticised fairly, as producing these ideas.
1.4.6.2.1.2. Con: Many of these false ideas come direct from mainstream contemporary feminist activism: feminist blogs, YouTube channels and websites. This activism often learns these concepts from feminism-supporting university courses and disciplines, such as gender studies.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Feminists promote the concept of a '[rape culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture)' even though many consider it a myth.
1.4.6.3.1. Con: Rape culture is so engrained into modern-day society that often people are unaware of what is deemed rape and what is not.
1.4.6.3.1.1. Pro: People often see rape in the media but don't recognize it as rape or chalk it up to a "lesser" form of rape; for example, in shows like Game of Thrones, we are expected to actually root for and admire characters who have committed blatant sexual assault.
1.4.6.3.1.2. Con: The concept 'rape' has been stretched to include mere sexual molestation. It is important to distinguish between these terms as one as a far more significant impact than the other.
1.4.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: The [Oxford Dictionary](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rape) defines 'rape' as: "the crime, typically committed by a man, of forcing another person to have sexual intercourse with the offender against their will".
1.4.6.3.1.3. Pro: [A report](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11362194/Why-students-dont-understand-what-counts-as-rape.html) illustrated that young people do not understand what constitutes rape: a third of male university students' answers showed that they would rape a woman if there were no consequences. This was because they didn’t recognise that these actions were, in fact, rape.
1.4.6.3.1.3.1. Pro: [1/3 of women](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11343380/Sexually-assault-1-in-3-UK-female-students-victim-on-campus.html) at university in the UK have been sexually assaulted or abused.
1.4.6.3.1.3.2. Pro: That 32% went [down to 16%](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11362194/Why-students-dont-understand-what-counts-as-rape.html) when students were asked the same question, only worded to use 'rape'. Though still a high percentage, this illustrates the knowledge gap that exists and the effects that it can have.
1.4.6.3.2. Con: Victim-blaming for rape incidents is still prevalent in society, which is a significant part of rape culture.
1.4.6.3.2.1. Con: The term "rape culture" deceptively portrays the act of raping as a significant part of the culture; that rape is both frequent and accepted. The occurrence of victim-blaming is not sufficient to support this interpretation.
1.4.6.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.1.3.
1.4.6.3.2.2. Pro: Victim-blaming directs the responsibility for rape prevention on the victim: not walking alone at night, not drinking to excess, adhering to certain norms of sexual behaviour and avoid perceived promiscuity. Feminism redirects this responsibility back the perpetrator, as it ought to be.
1.4.6.3.3. Con: Rape culture is a real phenomenon with many facets.
1.4.6.3.3.1. Pro: Rapists may be in theory despised, but they often are not in practice.
1.4.6.3.3.1.1. Pro: In many rape cases, the media focuses disproportionately on what the survivor should have done to prevent the rape, when the onus is of course on the rapist.
1.4.6.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: During the [Belfast Rape Trial](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/inside-court-12-the-complete-story-of-the-belfast-rape-trial-1.3443620?mode=amp), the alleged victim was asked if she had been "staring" at the defendant on the night of the incident.
1.4.6.3.3.1.1.2. Con: This is rarely true. The vast majority of rape reports in the media do not focus disproportionately on what the survivor should have done.
1.4.6.3.3.1.2. Pro: Rapists, especially upper-class white male rapists, have received minimal punishment even in the face of overwhelming evidence against them \(see the [Brock Turner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_v._Turner) case\).
1.4.6.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: Due to the legal principle of "innocent until proven guilty", it is common for victims in rape trials to be considered untruthful until proven otherwise.
1.4.6.3.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.1.1.1.
1.4.6.3.3.1.2.3. Con: There is no evidence that overall, upper-class straight white male rapists receive minimal punishment more than others for committing similar or different crimes. This is a false narrative pushed by feminists.
1.4.6.3.3.2. Pro: The under reporting of sexual assault and rape is a part of rape culture.
1.4.6.3.3.2.1. Pro: It's a widely acknowledged problem that sexual assault and rape is under reported.
1.4.6.3.4. Con: Politicians, institutional leaders, police and many others have a proven track record of trying to suppress, minimize or ignore information about rapes or even prevent evidence collection, to the benefit of rapists over victims.
1.4.6.3.5. Pro: In the West, where rapists are openly denounced and despised, it makes no sense to claim there is a rape culture.
1.4.6.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.
1.4.6.3.5.2. Con: Revenge of the Nerds was a popular movie where the protagonists raped women, surreptitiously filmed them and stole their underwear.
1.4.6.3.5.3. Con: Brett Kavanaugh will very likely be the next Supreme Court Justice because a thin majority choose to ignore numerous likely claims against him. The President has even sabotaged the FBI investigation to protect the alleged rapist.
1.4.6.3.6. Pro: Feminists inflate sexual assault statistics.
1.4.6.3.6.1. Con: It is more likely that [men don't understand consent](http://www.scarymommy.com/science-shows-that-men-dont-understand-consent-and-we-say-it-isnt-rocket-science/), and so don't classify their behavior as assault when it really is.
1.4.6.3.6.1.1. Pro: [See Kobe Bryant's puzzling apology letter](https://www.thenation.com/article/wrestling-in-with-kobe-bryants-forgotten-apology/), written to the victim after he was cleared of charges, he clearly describes a situation where there was no consent, and insists he still believed there was consent.
1.4.6.3.6.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.4.
1.4.6.3.6.3. Pro: They suggest one in four women are raped on US college campuses, though the real figure could be [one in forty](http://time.com/100091/campus-sexual-assault-christina-hoff-sommers/).
1.4.6.3.6.4. Con: -> See 1.4.6.3.3.2.1.
1.4.6.3.6.5. Pro: Campus rape claims [are distorted](https://www.city-journal.org/html/campus-rape-myth-13061.html) by inaccurate studies and lobbying of feminist activists and a 'rape prevention industry' selling services and courses.
1.4.6.3.7. Con: The word 'rape' is often trivialised, showing that society does not recognise the severity of such an act.
1.4.6.3.7.1. Pro: One example of this is how the word "rape" has become slang in some communities, like [gamers](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/closed-threads/143803-rape-and-game-culture), for "triumph" or "win"--e.g. saying "I raped you" after you beat someone at a game.
1.4.6.4. Pro: A huge amount of things have been declared sexist by feminists, many of which seem hyperbolic or ridiculous.
1.4.6.4.1. Con: Some of the things in that list are broadly considered sexist both by feminists and non-feminists, such as Christianity or the church.
1.4.6.4.2. Pro: [Science](https://whyscienceissexist.wordpress.com/) and [STEM](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/students-tell-stem-sexism-bristol) courses have been accused of sexist behaviour and atmospheres.
1.4.6.4.2.1. Con: There is ample evidence that, from earliest upbringing, girls are dissuaded from science-based subjects, and are not taken seriously in them as careers. It is a very real problem, certainly not hyperbolic or ridiculous.
1.4.6.4.3. Pro: Several [faiths](http://www.chabadbrisbane.com/templates/articlecco_cdo/aid/964239/jewish/Judaism-Is-Sexist.htm) [and](http://www.religiouscriticism.com/bible/the-sexist-bible/) [religious](http://www.religiouscriticism.com/bible/the-sexist-bible/) [leaders](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/607531/Dalai-Lama-Sexist-Attractive-woman-successor-London-Britain-Tibet-Perez-Hilton) have been condemned as sexist by feminists.
1.4.6.4.3.1. Con: Out the four parent examples, two are exactly the same. Those two, plus another link a sexist religion \(Christianity and Judaism\), thus not helping the claim. The only example you have of feminists accusing people of being sexism where it doesn't exist is the Dalai Lama, which [Does not](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/the-pacific-heart/201509/no-the-dalai-lama-is-not-sexist-taming-the-angernet) seem to be a [true claim.](http://www.tibetanfeministcollective.org/2015/09/23/yes-his-holiness-the-dalai-lama-is-still-a-feminist/)
1.4.6.4.3.2. Con: Most religions are run by men, worshipping a male god and promoting the subjugation of women; it is entirely valid - and not hyperbolic in the slightest - to correctly identify religion as sexist.
1.4.6.4.4. Pro: [Feminism itself](http://www.debate.org/opinions/is-feminism-sexist) has been accused of being sexist.
1.4.6.4.4.1. Con: A lot of accusations against feminism are untrue. For example, pro men's rights organisations using logical fallacies to try and make feminists look bad. Hence why people have negative opinions on sexism, those opinions are based off lies.
1.4.6.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.4.6.4.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.4.6.5. Pro: Feminism suggests there is a wage gap in the West, that should be eliminated when in reality, [it doesn't exist](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html).
1.4.6.5.1. Con: [EU figures](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Gender_pay_gap_statistics) show an \(unadjusted\) average 16.2 % gap \(2016, gross hourly earnings\).
1.4.6.5.2. Pro: Any gap in earnings between men and women represent different typical life choices that men and women make, rather than systematic discrimination.
1.4.6.5.2.1. Con: Systematic discrimination impacts the life choices that women make.
1.4.6.5.2.2. Con: Women are [paid less for doing the same jobs with the same experience](http://www.yalescientific.org/2013/02/john-vs-jennifer-a-battle-of-the-sexes/).
1.4.6.5.2.3. Pro: Women choose to have children, which pauses their careers in a way that employers could do without.
1.4.6.5.2.3.1. Con: It is couples and families, not women alone, who make the decision. It just so happens that nature dictates it is a woman who must carry the child.
1.4.6.5.3. Con: There may not be a huge gap when you compare men and women in the same job, but female dominated jobs such as social care and nursing are under paid for their skills and duties.
1.4.6.5.3.1. Con: It is unclear who gets to decide what constitutes being underpaid.
1.4.6.5.4. Con: It does not exist if you control for differences in job choices, hours worked, amongst other factors. However, these different factors are themselves determined by societal or historical sexism, and as such the pay gap continues to pose a problem.
1.4.6.5.4.1. Con: [Childbearing](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/19/17018380/gender-wage-gap-childcare-penalty) \(an exclusively female attribute that falls under the vague "other factors" category and accounts for a majority of the pay gap\) is by no means "determined by societal or historical sexism." Biology does not work like that.
1.4.6.5.5. Pro: The metric includes women who were affected by sexism in the 70s through to the 90s. Their careers today do not reflect their full potential. Because of this, the wage gap metric is a measure of sexism over the past 50 years, not a measure of sexism today.
1.4.6.5.5.1. Pro: Measures of the gender pay gap among recent college graduates show a reverse wage gap with women [making 8% more](http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html).
1.4.6.5.6. Pro: The gender pay gap is often conflated with the unadjusted pay gap. When all variables other than gender are controlled for, such as hours worked, occupation, education, the pay gap disappears.
1.4.6.5.6.1. Con: This claim says that there is a gap; It didn't say that there were excuses or justifications for a gap, it said that the gap didn't exist.
1.4.6.5.6.2. Pro: This [source](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/Glassdoor-Gender-Pay-Gap-Study.pdf) narrows it down to 5.4%, but fails to account for hours worked. This [source](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0779dc2f-4a4e-4386-b847-9ae919735acc/gender-pay-inequality----us-congress-joint-economic-committee.pdf) controls for hours worked, which reduces the wage gap by 6.0 percentage points.
1.4.6.5.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.5.6.1.
1.4.6.5.6.2.2. Pro: This [report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/atus_06242016.pdf) finds that among full time, year round workers, men work 8.2 hours a day compared to women's 7.8. This would mean women work 4.5% fewer hours than men.
1.4.6.5.6.2.2.1. Pro: The same study, this time for 2016 instead of 2015, found that accounting for hours worked would reduce the gap by [7.1](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/atus.pdf) percentage points.
1.4.6.5.6.3. Con: The problem lies in the various factors that the unadjusted pay gap controls for. It is in enabling women to work more hours, receive a greater education and aspire to more well-paid occupations that the government should act.
1.4.6.5.7. Pro: The gap does not actually exist beyond a statistical anomaly. The true gap is near [6%](https://web.archive.org/web/20160327195224/http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/Gender_Wage_Gap_Report.pdf), which is within one standard deviation, and is therefore insignificant from a statistical standpoint.
1.4.7. Pro: Feminism makes women's views, concerns and issues heard. This is not a platform that they would otherwise have access to.
1.4.7.1. Con: This is absolutely a platform women would have access too, its literally called democracy.
1.4.7.2. Con: It is wrong to assume that male politicians or speakers do not consider the views of any woman, or women, in their lives, that men do not give any consideration to the wishes of their mothers, or wives, or sisters, or daughters without feminism.
1.4.7.3. Con: Feminists regularly try to de-platform and silence people with opinions they don't agree with, including other women. Examples [Christina Hoff Sommers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha2E5aQ7yb8) , [Jordan B Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irfj1FxQkcI) , [Cassie Jaye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5y-BZyOxDg) , to name a few.
1.4.7.4. Pro: Feminism keeps women's rights and well-being in popular discourse and at the top of people's minds.
1.4.7.4.1. Con: Women's rights and well-being do not need to be at the top of our minds; women already have rights, so we do not need to keep this as a paramount thought. Women as a group do not deserve to have their well-being treated as more important than anybody else's well-being.
1.4.7.4.2. Con: Women's well-being was of paramount importance, as changes in law in history prior to the vote were often changed in the spirit of a [woman's rights and well-being through the influence of public opinion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_National_Anti-Suffrage_League)
1.4.7.5. Pro: Feminism helps breed recognition and support for under-represented female leaders and ideas.
1.4.7.5.1. Con: This is demeaning to women, making the declaration that they aren't able to earn things on their own merit, rather they must have affirmative action.
1.4.7.5.1.1. Con: This ignores the fact that it's more noteworthy when a woman is the first to do 'x' because, unlike men, they have faced obstacles in getting there that men have not had to deal with.
1.4.7.5.2. Con: There is no reason to believe that women at large are specifically benefited from other women holding leadership positions.
1.4.7.5.2.1. Con: The existence of female leaders can provide inspiration for other women who aspire to positions of influence.
1.4.7.5.2.2. Con: The existence of powerful female leaders can change social perceptions of women's abilities and opportunities. This could make it more possible for women to advance in a range of roles.
1.4.7.5.2.3. Con: Female leaders understand the specific problems facing women, from a first person perspective, in a way that a male leader cannot. This gives them a different insight when tackling problems that exclusively face women.
1.4.7.5.3. Con: There have been examples where women have been given advantages over men when trying to reach leadership roles; for example, in [UK elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-women_shortlist). This is sexist discrimination.
1.4.7.5.3.1. Con: Positive discrimination initiatives exist to redress the balance that sexism and lack of equal opportunities has distorted. It is therefore a countermeasure born out of sexist discrimination.
1.4.7.5.3.1.1. Con: Discrimination is never justified.
1.4.7.5.3.2. Pro: All-women shortlists are undemocratic.
1.4.7.5.3.2.1. Con: Party selection processes are typically undemocratic. Parties are free to choose whatever candidates they wish, just like any organisation.
1.4.7.5.3.2.2. Con: People are always free to vote for whichever candidate they wish, at the election, which is democratic.
1.4.8. Pro: Feminism has allowed for women to express their sexuality more openly and helped to deconstruct the taboos encompassing nudity, sensuality, romance, and connectedness.
1.5. Pro: Feminism fights to correct injustices against women.
1.5.1. Con: Nowadays, at least in western societies, women have the same rights than men. The alleged injustices most feminists fight against are instead social misconducts.
1.5.1.1. Con: Sexism intersects with other forms of opression and [many women still experience subjugation.](http://www.lsunow.com/daily/opinion-white-feminism-not-inclusive-counterproductive-to-movement/article_fc6f7e44-172f-11e8-b332-bb46560c2fa5.html)
1.5.1.2. Con: Men's sexual health is [legally endorsed](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-cover-viagra-if-contraceptives-arent-covered_us_5963eceee4b0deab7c646b13) while women's sexual health is steadily losing legal ground.
1.5.1.3. Con: [35% of women](http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures) worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner at some point in their lives. This is more than a 'social misconduct' and needs to be fought.
1.5.1.4. Con: Feminism doesn't only fight for the same rights, but also the same opportunities.
1.5.2. Pro: Feminists help combat and expose sexist objectification of women in society.
1.5.2.1. Con: Feminism sets an unqualified moral standard upon all women regarding sexual objectification. Not all women would agree that being appreciated \(by either gender\) for one's attractiveness is a bad thing.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Appreciation and objectification are not the same thing. The difference is that appreciation simply indicates enjoyment of something or someone, while sexual objectification means that one person sees the other as a means to an end in a way that ignores or dismisses the humanity of the other.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Practically, objectification without considering one's humanity is common and considered by most to be acceptable. People rarely humanize people they don't have personal relationships with, i.e. service workers. Individuals are usually fine with being treated as objects until puritans attach 'sexual' to the label.
1.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Many people have personal conversations with the people they interact with in public all of the time.
1.5.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: People may be able to make personal connections with strangers, but they are not socially expected to.
1.5.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Neutrally interacting with someone in the public sphere is not inherently viewing them as an object. This is a separate issue than having intimate, private interactions \(like sex\) with another individual.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: Feminism is not a monolith capable of imposing unqualified moral standards.
1.5.2.1.2.1. Con: This maybe true, literally, but is practically false. Individual supporters of feminism try to impose moral standards. This is the problem with the ambiguity of feminism.
1.5.2.1.2.1.1. Con: If feminism is ambiguous, then it, inherently, is incapable of imposing moral standards, either practically or literally.
1.5.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: If feminism is ambiguous then it is can't reasonably be considered a force for good.
1.5.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Individual feminist argue against sexual objectification and there are a variety of standards used to discuss the issue. There is no standard imposition.
1.5.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: With no standard, the doctrine of feminism is impossible to debate - either attacking or defending. Presumptions must be made.
1.5.2.1.3. Con: Most people who believe in the idea of objectification understand it as something that depends on the people involved and the details of the situation. Lovers or strangers may disagree on whether objectification is happening, even if their general disapproval of objectification is mutual, and learned via feminist perspectives.
1.5.2.2. Con: Feminism can't combat sexual objectification because feminism can't impose moral standards.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: Feminism has fought sexual objectification for decades \(mostly with social pressure\), during which it has lessened and changed without a force for imposing the standards.
1.5.2.2.2. Con: Feminism can and does impose moral standards, it sets a norm for society based on a viewpoint of equality. Whilst the feminist movement cannot currently claim that it has eliminated the objectification of women through this process it can and does set moral standards.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Feminism is still relevant. Women are still [hypersexualized](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-22/street-harassment-survey-reveals-girls-as-young-as-11-catcalled/9783316) from [a tender age](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/it-s-scary-a-third-of-girls-harassed-in-public-before-they-are-15-20180521-p4zgma.html), harassed when they're still unable to understand what is going on, which makes them grow up feeling [scared](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3227029/) and [insecure](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/young-girls-report-online-harassment-digital-a7891276.html). A few extremists shall not render the movement unlegit.
1.5.2.4. Pro: Video games, and their surrounding culture, are a current and real example of sexism.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: Videos games feature women \(often sexualised\) [as passive decoration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZPSrwedvsg), objectifying them.
1.5.2.4.1.1. Con: The source linked in the claim severely undermines the point. Feminist Frequency has been proven to perpetuate lies and misinformation in order to slander and misrepresent the gaming community and gaming in general. [An example regarding the video game The Witcher 3.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/05/31/why-feminist-frequency-is-dead-wrong-about-the-witcher-3/)
1.5.2.5. Pro: Women face [harassment](http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/resources/statistics/) on the street, feminists work to combat this.
1.5.2.6. Con: Feminists bring a greater focus to women's female anatomy, not less; for example, "free the nipple" marches and "pussy hats".
1.5.2.6.1. Con: Focusing on the female anatomy is not inherently endorsing objectification.
1.5.2.6.2. Con: The Free the Nipple campaign is actually about desexualizing/deobjectifying female breasts.
1.5.2.7. Con: Feminists exhibit a glaring double standard in their apathy towards the objectification of men.
1.5.2.7.1. Con: Lots of feminists have argued that[it is not okay to objectify men.](https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/12/objectifying-mens-crotches-isnt-equality-makes-sexism-towards-women-worse-7305596/)
1.5.2.7.2. Con: Objectifying men does not [impact them](http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/opinion/objectifying-men-why-saying-a-man-is-hot-is-ok-9702) same way as the objectification of women impacts women.
1.5.2.7.2.1. Pro: Objectification of women [directly impacts](https://www.fastcompany.com/40489432/how-hiring-managers-hire-women-based-on-their-appearance) how they're perceived in hiring practices.
1.5.2.7.2.1.1. Con: Just because a subset of employers select women based on their appearance, that doesn't mean objectifying men is acceptable.
1.5.2.7.2.1.2. Con: The referenced survey is evidence of prejudice but not objectification. If you're hiring someone for a job, you want the job to be done - not hiring an ornament.
1.5.2.7.2.2. Pro: Women are [more likely](http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/resources/statistics/) than men to be victims of street harrassment.
1.5.3. Pro: Treatment and research for women's health issues have not been and still are not prioritized as highly as comparable health issues for men or neutral to gender.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Women's health rights are politically attacked all over the United States with regards to their doctor patient privacy, terminations of unsafe or unwanted pregnancy, for payment for medical insurance claims.
1.5.4. Pro: Feminism fights to protect women from violent abuse.
1.5.4.1. Con: Modern Feminism fails to reconcile rape and sexual abuse with various misogynistic practices inherent in specific religions.
1.5.4.1.1. Pro: Feminists often claim Islam is compatible when in reality the two [contradict](https://www.eurozine.com/islamic-feminism-contradiction-terms/) each other, particularly in [Middle Eastern](http://www.dw.com/en/womens-rights-in-the-islamic-world/a-40714427) countries. Western Feminism studiously ignores this, creating a logical blind spot.
1.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: Feminism [has been quiet](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/why-is-feminism-so-quiet-about-muslim-women-who-refuse-to-wear-the-hijab-1.3189620) and failed to actively support Muslim women who refuse to wear the veil, for fear of being branded islamophobic.
1.5.4.2. Pro: [Female genital mutilation](http://www.feminist.org/global/fgm.html) \(FGM\) is a massive problem world wide, which feminists work to end.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: [100+ male infants die](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/boyhood-studies/4/1/bhs040106.xml) in the US each year due to circumcision. Some feminists disregard male genital mutilation as on par with FGM. This could be seen as hypocritical because both issues impede on a person's right to body autonomy, right to give consent, and risk life-long sexual dysfunction.
1.5.4.2.1.1. Pro: The [FSR](http://www.fsrinc.org/whats-wrong-genital-autonomy/) said: "Feminists should insist on the fundamental difference between male and female circumcision and speak out against criminalizing male circumcision "
1.5.4.3. Pro: Feminists fight to protect women from rape and sexual abuse.
1.5.4.4. Con: Feminism gets in the way of other, more effective approaches to tackling injustices, which have fewer negative side-effects.
1.5.4.4.1. Con: Tackling those problems is, by definition, feminism.
1.5.4.4.2. Con: If the objection is only to the name feminism and the organisation of efforts under one umbrella, then this isn't really a substantive objection to feminist activism and activity.
1.5.4.4.2.1. Con: The argument is not to do everything feminism does without calling it feminism, but rather to accomplish some of what feminism claims as goals, but to do away with other aspects of feminism that are more harmful than helpful.
1.5.4.4.3. Pro: The approach of [egalitarianism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/) could be used which defends rights for all people, not just women.
1.5.4.4.3.1. Pro: [Feminism is](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/feminism) 'the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes'. A better term for someone who believes in gender equality would be an 'egalitarian', as this does not come with the implication of advocating solely for women's rights.
1.5.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: The claim, that these problems can be addressed without naming the movement Feminism, is substantive because Feminism leads to gender bias.
1.5.4.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Feminism was born from gender bias, and has a proven track record of lessening it
1.5.4.4.3.1.2. Con: The way "Egalitarianism" fails some people is when sexists don't beleive they are sexist, because it is normal to them. People have various justifications for thinking it's fair for other people to live by other rules. The benefit of naming feminism for a woman's point of view implicitly shows that perspective, and that "normal" is not "normal"; It was not / is not representing women.
1.5.4.4.3.1.3. Con: The term feminism implies equality for all, but has a focus on female issues as they have been the historically oppressed sex. There is nothing wrong with highlighting this, and supporting the fight to rectify this and get everyone on a level playing field in terms of gender equality.
1.5.4.4.3.2. Con: Egalitarianism is feminism, by definition.
1.5.4.4.3.3. Con: Egalitarianism doesn't provide the resources, perspectives and framework to help with uniquely female issues.
1.5.4.4.3.3.1. Con: Feminism doesn't provide the resources, perspectives, and framework to help with uniquely male issues either, but egalitarianism has the space to include them both.
1.5.4.4.3.4. Con: Egalitarianism doesn't have the same history of activism and creating real social and political change.
1.5.4.4.3.4.1. Con: Feminism once didn't either. This can easily be changed.
1.5.4.4.3.4.2. Con: Egalitarianism has been around much longer fighting many more battles than feminism has. It just hasn't been as well branded.
1.5.4.4.3.4.2.1. Con: Many so-called "egalitarian" philosophies and organizations were not as egalitarian as they claim, or as egalitarian as feminism. Sikhs, Christians, Jews, English and French people have all still had gender inequalities that feminists felt they had \(or have\) to resolve. Women couldn't even vote in England or France until the 20th century \(thanks to feminists\).
1.5.4.4.3.4.2.2. Pro: The English Bill of Rights in 1689, The US Constitution, and the French Constitution of 1789 are based on egalitarian principles of '[Equality of Person & Gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism#Equality_of_person)'.
1.5.4.4.3.4.2.3. Pro: The religions of Sikhism, Christianity, and Judaism have foundations on [egalitarian principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism#Religious_and_spiritual_egalitarianism).
1.5.4.4.3.5. Con: Feminism helps to create a more equal society for all of its members, not just for women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.1. Pro: Men have [thanked](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/the-good-men-inside-the-all-male-group-taking-on-modern-masculinity) and joined feminism for its help for men.
1.5.4.4.3.5.2. Pro: Justice-based feminism is good not just for women, but also any marginalized group, because it focuses on ways to expose one-way power dynamics.
1.5.4.4.3.5.2.1. Pro: First and second wave feminist theory has been copied by many marginalized populations to reduce discrimination.
1.5.4.4.3.5.2.1.1. Con: An ideology is a collection of ideas, and that the probability that it produces one good idea is pretty high. That doesn't make a case for the whole ideology though, only that specific idea.
1.5.4.4.3.5.2.1.2. Pro: Native Americans [have adopted](http://www.academia.edu/1330316/Decolonising_Feminism_Aboriginal_Women_and_the_Global_Sisterhood_) feminist advocacy strategies into many equal rights and anti-bigotry movements.
1.5.4.4.3.5.2.1.3. Pro: Many African anti-colonialism advocacy groups [have adopted](http://www.quest-journal.net/volXX/Quest_XX_Megwe.pdf) feminist theory to help stabilize daily life in Post-colonial Africa.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3. Con: Feminism overlooks areas in which men are disadvantaged and do not reach equality.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1. Con: Feminism exists for the very reason that society has historically been structured so as to privilege the rights, plight and success of men over all other members of society.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.1. Pro: Women have historically been regarded as object of exchange between the men, be they fathers or husbands, who owned them.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.2. Pro: Women throughout history have been [financially disenfranchised](https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2014/aug/11/women-rights-money-timeline-history), which removed their autonomy. Feminism was necessary to make improvements in this area.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: [Up until relatively recently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_rights_of_women_in_history#cite_note-:4-66), inheritance among the elites in Europe was passed on to the eldest male heir and never to the woman.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3. Pro: Women have historically been politically disenfranchised. Feminism was necessary for bringing about a change to that.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: Feminist movements such as the suffragettes helped obtain rights for women that were unjustly denied them.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2. Con: The history of feminism - good or bad - has little bearing on whether it is still a positive force.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.1. Con: Its history could be predictive though. If a movement has a history of making positive contributions, it could likely continue making positive contributions.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: Feminism is no longer needed.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Men still feel they can’t properly express themselves without being ridiculed by other men and women, they need feminism.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Suicide rates are the highest in men because some feel like they can’t talk about their problems without being made to feel they’re being “unmanly” or too “feminine” for expressing emotions. They still need feminism.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Higher male suicide rates are caused in large part due to the use of more lethal methods by men. Women attempt suicide [just as much as men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide). Feminism is unlikely to address this issue.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that men are likelier to choose lethal methods than women is most likely a result of social inequality between men and women. As social equity is part of feminism it should be able to address this issue.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Patriarchy \(rigid gender roles\) may not necessarily be the specific root cause of men's issues such as [male suicide](https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/). Mental health problems are not caused entirely by social structures, as many people have a [genetic predisposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diathesis%E2%80%93stress_model) to those issues before mental health disorders may/may not develop.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Regardless of the path that leads men to contemplate suicide, it is well-understood that asking for help is a monumental factor towards recovery. Many men believe asking for help is 'weak' because they should "man up"
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: In a patriarchal society men are discouraged from speaking out about being victims of sexual assault because they're told that men either "can't be raped" or "should have enjoyed it".
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.3. Con: Just because men require the absence of a patriarchy does not of itself prove that men require feminism.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: it does not necessarily connect that because men suffer \(just as women do\) from a patriarchal system that therefore they require feminism. Advocating for women to have equal rights to men does not logically lead to men being removed from the damage that a patriarchy might do.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.3.2. Con: Feminism has [helped](https://mic.com/articles/88277/23-ways-feminism-has-made-the-world-a-better-place-for-men#.ViRN0CwjX) men.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4. Con: But it is feminists with the I bathe in male tears mugs, it is feminists who shut down a talk on [male suffering and suicide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iARHCxAMAO0). It was feminists who protested screenings of the Red Pill. Men do not need a ideology that repeatedly shames them and shuts down any investigation of their issues.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.13.4.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.2. Pro: Many feminist 'words' attack men. For example: 'manspreading' or 'mansplaining'.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.1. Con: These words are employed as a criticism of some traits generally employed by men which undermine women. They are not anti-male, per se, but rather against this particular behaviour.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.1.1. Con: If these words were simply referring to the antisocial act of, for example with mansplaining, 'talking down to someone', then it would be illogical to add the word 'man' in the front of it. One does not in fact need to use the term 'mansplaining' as patronising is a fitting substitution, and is gender neutral.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Considering the term patronising exists an a suitable substitute, the term 'mansplaining' could be seen as sexist.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Mansplaining is more than simply being patronizing towards someone. It is to explain in a patronizing way, with the explainer often having no regard that the explainee knows more than the explainer about the given topic.

\(see the first sentence of the [second paragraph](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2012/11/a-cultural-history-of-mansplaining/264380/).\)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: Terms such as 'mansplaining' refer specifically to men patronising women, and is therefore attacking men by implying we need a term specifically for this behaviour: it implies that women do not partake in such behaviour, or implies that a women patronising someone is different to a man patronising someone.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.2.1. Con: '[Mansplaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining)' is called what it is simply because men partake in it [more often](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/it-s-man-s-and-woman-s-world/201603/the-psychology-mansplaining) then women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: The assumption here is that men only \(more often\) pedantically explain things to women. Men talk down to other men [just as much](http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/hsl_shl/van%20Baalen.htm). Being the recipient of "mansplaining" is an example of equal treatment.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: 'Mansplaining' is not a useful term: "\[you\] don't fight patronizing [by patronizing in return."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining#Criticism)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.3. Pro: Patriarchy is another word that attacks men as a group for societal norms which have a tendency to oppress women, ignoring the roles of women and other forces, and rejecting the notion that at one time there may have been reasonable justification.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.3. Con: To be unbiased, it should be pointed out that in the video linked by the parent about the protest on "male suffering and suicide" was being talked about by a person who apparently is pro-rape.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.2. Con: [Statistics](https://mic.com/articles/168585/the-next-time-someone-tells-you-sexism-is-over-show-them-these-statistics#.Xe35t6VRA) indicate that we still don't have gender equality.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: While the above statistics provide an idea of disparity, they are only one side of the picture. Importantly, it in unknown the true extent that men face sexual harassment, physical or sexual \(domestic\) violence or assault. Due to the gender stereotyping, the few figures available are believed to be grossly under-reported.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: [70%](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/toplines_harassment_0819202013.pdf) of women who claim to have been sexually assulated in the workplace did not report it.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.2.3. Pro: [35%](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2013/violence_against_women_20130620/en/) of women worldwide are victims of physical or sexual violence.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.2.4. Pro: [1 in 5](https://ncadv.org/learn-more/statistics) women have been raped in their lifetime, as opposed to 1 in 71 men.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.2.5. Pro: Women’s hygiene products cost [13% more](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dca/partners/gender-pricing-study.page) than male hygiene products.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4. Con: There are still many unjust laws and practices that affect women in the US.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.1. Pro: Women in the US earn approximately [20% less](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/03/gender-pay-gap-facts/) than their male counterparts.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.6.5.2.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.2. Pro: 90% of underage children who are married in the US [are girls](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/opinion/americas-child-marriage-problem.html).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.2.1. Con: This statistic, upon closer inspection, would condone forced abortion to women under age of majority \(which is not the same as age of consent\). Many young girls marry out of love or customs \(out-of-wedlock/shotgun weddings\).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.2.2. Con: This statistic does not differentiate for voluntary marriage of young couples or cultural arrangements to avoid "out-of-wedlock" birth, and includes women above age of consent in most states \(but [includes all women under age of majority](http://www.tahirih.org/news/child-marriage-happens-in-the-u-s-too/)\).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.3. Pro: Some US states have [outdated consent laws](http://www.wbtv.com/story/13227226/critics-say-no-doesnt-mean-no-when-rape-happens-in-nc) that do not allow consent to be revoked once granted.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: Outdated can be considered "established" law, which asserts that all parties involved understand what consent is, how it is given, and when/how it can be taken.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.4. Pro: In the US State of Georgia, [it is legal](http://time.com/4422772/upskirt-photos-harassment/) to take "upskirt" photos of women without their consent.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.5. Pro: [Seven US states](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/health/parental-rights-rapists-explainer/) do not have laws protecting rape victims from custody lawsuits.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.6. Pro: [In Oklahoma](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/27/oral-sex-rape-ruling-tulsa-oklahoma-alcohol-consent), having oral sex with a person who is unconscious due to alcohol consumption is not considered rape.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.6.1. Con: This may indeed be an unjust law that affects women, but it is not a sexist law, as anybody can be orally raped.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.7. Pro: Abortion remains restricted or illegal in much of the world for women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.7.1. Con: Abortion is murder thus unethical.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.7.1.1. Con: Abortion \(and murder, in general\) is not inherently unethical, for example, it can be justified by a self-defense argument if the life of the mother is in danger
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5. Pro: Injustices against women have been mostly resolved.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.1. Pro: Feminism distracts people from bigger issues.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.1.1. Pro: Feminism puts emphasis on identity politics, and takes attention away from economic decline overall, where these issues are focused on women as compared to men, rather than the overall decline in economics.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.1.2. Con: This assumes people have only a finite amount of attention and thus can not be distracted by more than a given set of issues \(and the movements that try to combat them\).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.2. Con: According to [this point](https://www.kialo.com/is-feminism-a-force-for-good-6492/6492.0=6492.1-6492.7+6492.17), injustices are still not fully resolved. Therefore we still need feminism.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.3. Pro: Women have legal equality in the West, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.3.1. Con: Even in the west, women still don't have equal access to many of their rights, particularly [when it comes to healthcare](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/05/this-map-depicts-abortion-access-across-america-and-its-really-bleak/)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.3.2. Con: Just because women in the West have equality under the law does not mean they have equality in practice.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.3.3. Con: There are still many women in the world, who may well not be in the West, who do not have such equality. It is important that feminism stays alive all over the world to protect their rights.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.4. Pro: Organisations exists to protect women from domestic violence and other kind of abuse.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.5. Pro: People in the developed world mostly believe men and women are equally capable.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.5.1. Con: Women are held to a higher standard than men. Eg, due to [rape culture](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/06/05/brock_turner_s_dad_s_defense_proves_why_his_victim_had_to_write_her_letter.html), if a women comes out about sexual assault, the woman is blamed for 'asking for it', or 'provoking the action', whereas men are asked to be exempt from punishment because 'boys will be boys'.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.5.2. Con: Even in the developed world, men and women are often held capable for different things. For instance, women are often believed to be better in child caring, while men are often believed to be better in highly technical tasks
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6. Con: Despite lawful equality being achieved in several countries, political, economical, personal and social equity have [not been achieved yet.](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2015/09/no-country-has-yet-achieved-equality-between-men-and-women-un-human-rights-chief/)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.1. Con: Inequality exists for both genders. A movement that advocates for gender equality would be more appropriate now than Feminism which focuses on one gender.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.1.1. Con: Feminism does argue for gender equality. It simply starts from the assumption that women are at a disadvantage and thus need advocating for.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.1.2. Con: [Feminism helps men and has overturned laws unfavourable to males.](https://mic.com/articles/88277/23-ways-feminism-has-made-the-world-a-better-place-for-men#.VootIviQA)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.2. Pro: This is true, but is also not a problem. Because in a society that offers truly equal opportunities for both genders, you would not see equal representation. In places such as Sweden \(where equal opportunities are strongly enforced\) you see an effect called the [Gender Equality Paradox](http://www.thejournal.ie/gender-equality-countries-stem-girls-3848156-Feb2018/). When given truly free choice, women and men tend to gravitate toward more traditional gender roles when it comes to career choice.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.3. Pro: Gendered or sexualised marketing degrades women to be an object for the use of men. Examples of this are the UltraTune tyre ad: [abc.net.au](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-20/ultratune-ad-campaign-criticised-as-sexist/7102438)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.3.1. Con: Men are also degraded and [sexualised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwYCvTpYMCA) in adverts aimed at [women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmVexzzVfDA).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.3.1.1. Pro: It is a [growing problem](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11395576/Men-are-now-objectified-more-than-women.html) and feminism couldn't care less about the [double](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/12/12/hunkvertising-is-the-rise-of-mens-sexual-objectification-equality/) [standard](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/why-sexual-objectification-men-tv-143951686.html).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.3.1.2. Con: The [proportion](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/social_issues-july-dec13-sexualization_12-21) of men being sexualized is much [less than](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-011-9093-2) the proportion of women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.3.2. Con: That is a gross generalization that misrepresents an entire industry. The subject of whatever sexualization may or may not be present in a specific advertisement depends on the very target market the campaign is aimed at.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.4. Pro: Although women get paid the same amount as men, the lowest paying careers \(teachers, nurses\) have historically been 'women's' jobs, and are therefore valued less even though they are integral to society.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.4.1. Con: While teachers and nurses are valuable professions that some would argue are underpaid for the work they do, they are by no means the lowest paid careers.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.4.2. Con: Women have the right to choose their career paths. The fact that certain professions are dominated by women \(or men, for that matter\) might simply be the result of decades of freedom of choice.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.4.3. Con: Salary does not correlate perfectly to societal value.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.5. Pro: In parenting, fathers are applauded for the slightest thing, like dropping their children off at school or going to an appointment about the pregnancy, whereas mothers are expected to do these things, and when they do the smallest things wrong, they are called out and shamed. As [Ali Wong](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/comedian-makes-hilarious-observation-about-the-way-we-praise-dads_us_57a1fa40e4b08a8e8b602917) once said, "It takes so little to be considered a great dad, and it also takes so little to be considered a bad mom."
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.5.1. Con: [Courts](https://www.galbraithfamilylaw.com/blog/ontario-courts-biased-mothers-divorce-cases/) tend to [favour](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-hughes/are-custody-decisions-bia_b_870709.html) women \([mothers](http://www.familylore.co.uk/2007/12/why-courts-favour-mothers.html)\) in custody battles in [most western countries](https://www.complexfamilylaw.com/Articles-by-Gene-C-Colman/Gender-Bias-in-the-Family-Courts-of-Canada-Fact-or-Fantasy.shtml).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.6. Pro: Feminism is still needed in all countries, as sexual harassment/assault is still an overwhelming issue everywhere.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.6.1. Con: Feminism is not necessarily the solution to the sexual harassment/assault issue.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.7. Pro: If women are outspoken or loud, especially in careers dominated by men, they are ridiculed and called 'bossy', 'rude' and 'unfeminine'.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.8. Pro: Women are criticised much more than men when it comes to body positivity. This is also a part of internalised sexism, as frequently other women and media outlets aimed at women \(NW, Famous Weekly\) also promote the idea that women can only be attractive if they're skinny. This is why [64%](https://www.eatingdisorders.org.au/key-research-a-statistics) of people with eating disorders are women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.8.1. Con: That assumes that the only cause of eating disorders is "internalized sexism." In fact, [women are generally more likely to be diagnosed with a mental illness than men](http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/genderwomen/en/). Reasons for that are still unclear; as such, it would be unfair to blanket an entire field of study under gender inequality.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.9. Pro: In over 60 countries, women are still not allowed to legally undergo the medical procedure of an abortion.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.9.1. Con: That fact does not count as an example of gender inequality because men can not get pregnant.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.9.1.1. Con: It’s an issue of gender equality as men are never forced to have their bodily autonomy overwritten by conservative legislation.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.10. Pro: Women are looked down upon if, by the age of 30, they're not married with kids, whereas men are revered for not 'settling down' or 'chaining themself to a woman'. Examples of this are in the media, where comedians such as Katherine Ryan and Roisin Conarty are constantly criticised for still being single, whereas comedians like Jack Whitehall and James Acaster are in the same situation and are not given the same criticisms.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.10.1. Con: Human biology causes[female fertility to decrease drastically with age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_and_female_fertility). In fact,[women worldwide hit menopause at around 50 years of age](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025712515000218?via%3Dihub), after which they can not conceive anymore. Given these biological axioms, it is only natural that women would be under pressure to settle and have a family.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.6.10.2. Con: With advanced maternal age, [chromosomal abnormalities increase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_maternal_age). Thus, it is not medically recommended for women to wait too long to have a child. This well-known reality can permeate other non-medical aspects of society, making it seem unfair towards women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7. Pro: Women are able to climb to the very top of society now.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.1. Con: The ability to achieve something does not preclude systematic obstacles to doing so being in place, as they have been for generations.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.2. Con: [In the G7](https://www.grantthornton.global/en/insights/articles/women-in-business-2016/), just 22% of senior roles are occupied by women and 39% of companies have no women at all in senior roles.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.2.1. Con: That assumes that women who actively went after those "senior roles" were discriminated against due to their gender. Statistics in a vacuum are not useful.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.3. Con: Women have already been able to get to the top of the society before feminism even existed. For instance, Cleopatra and Maria Theresa were both leaders of their state.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.3.1. Con: Both [Cleopatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra) and [Maria Theresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Theresa) rose to power due to lineage. Their ascension had nothing to do with anything other than them being next in line.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.4. Pro: Women do well in the western educational systems.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.4.1. Pro: [Girls outperform boys](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-3) in many areas at school.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.4.2. Con: This high performance does not carry over when women progress in their careers and is not often reflected in their compensation \(see: gender wage gap\)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.4.2.1. Pro: An [in-depth analysis](https://hired.com/gender-wage-gap) of more than 100,000 job offers in the US found that 69% of the time, men receive higher salary offers than women for the same job title at the same company.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.4.2.1.1. Con: This analysis does not control for total compensation, age, experience, location or other factors - it just looks at men vs women for same job salaries.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.5.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.5. Pro: A patriarchal status quo does not exist in many western societies, as evidenced by females in positions of power. Both the current [UK Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May) and the recent [USA runner up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton) in the elections are women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.5.1. Con: Politically speaking, the overwhelming majority of representatives and leaders in the western world \(and the world as a whole\) are male. This is an easily verifiable fact. Since this is the status quo and is patriarchal \(dominated/controlled by men via majority\), it is thus a patriarchal status quo.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.5.1.1. Pro: In 2017, there were [only 15](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/08/women-leaders-around-the-world/) female world leaders in office in the world, eight of whom are their country’s first woman in power.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.5.2. Con: This is cherrypicking. Just because at least two world countries are led by women does not mean that political gender equality has been achieved.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.5.2.1. Con: The existence of female leaders in some of the most prominent and powerful positions in the world is evidence of equality of opportunity.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.5.2.1.1. Con: The existence of female leaders in some of the most prominent and powerful positions is not evidence of equality of opportunity. Evidence of equality of opportunity would actually look like a roughly equal balance of men and women in positions of power; this, however, is not the case.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.5.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.5.1.1.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.5.2.2. Pro: The US senate is overwhelmingly male, with a sparse handful of current and former [female senators](https://www.senate.gov/senators/ListofWomenSenators.htm).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.6. Pro: [More women](http://www.equilar.com/reports/48-associated-press-ceo-pay-study-2017.html) are in c-suite positions in Fortune 500 companies than ever before.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.6.1. Con: This speaks of the level of inequality of the past, and the success that feminism is having in correcting those inequalities. It still represents [just 6%](http://www.equilar.com/reports/48-associated-press-ceo-pay-study-2017.html) of c-suite positions.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.6. Con: There is still far too much [economic inequality](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nake-m-kamrany/gender-inequality_b_1417535.html) between men and women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.6.1. Pro: In the UK, female managers earn £[12,000](http://www.businessinsider.com/gender-pay-gap-female-managers-2017-9) less than men per year.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.7. Con: Feminism is needed in cultures where women have fewer rights, and it can be a force for good in these countries.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.7.1. Pro: Young girls in third world countries are being forced to marry men who will rape and impregnate them. Those girls need feminism.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.7.2. Pro: [12% of women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage#Child_marriage_by_region) in developing regions are married or in union before age 15. Child marriages lead to a host of negative consequences for those who are victims of it. They need feminists around the globe to fight for them, for they are unable to do so themselves.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.2.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8. Con: Misogynistic language is still persistently used in society.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.1. Pro: A [report](https://www.demos.co.uk/files/MISOGYNY_ON_TWITTER.pdf?1399567516) found more than 6 million instances of the word “slut” or “whore” used in English on Twitter in a year, 20% of which appeared to be threatening.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.1.1. Con: From that report, "Women are as almost as likely as men to use the terms ‘slut’ and ‘whore’ on Twitter. Not only are women using these words, they are directing them at each other, both casually and offensively; women are increasingly more inclined to engage in discourses using the same language that has been, and continues to be, used as derogatory against them."
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.2. Con: These words do not mean someone that hates women. They are offensive terms aimed specifically at women but that does not mean they hate women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.3. Con: There is a huge difference between hating one specific female individual for various reason, and hating women as a whole.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.4. Con: Feminism focuses on misogyny perpetrated by men, yet it is women who are more likely to use misogynistic language, abuse of women by women is not addressed in feminism.[Misogynistic language on twitter mainly used by women.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/women-most-likely-use-misogynistic-language-twitter-report-finds-a7364226.html)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.4.1. Con: The twitter report on women's misogynistic language showed findings separated by gender. It was discovered that women tended to favour derogatory name-calling "cow" or "bitch" while the men made more personal comments about a women's appearance, intelligence and sexuality. The latter implies a more deep-seated hatred and is arguably the reason why misogyny attracts a focus from feminism to men, even though they are not the sole perpetrators.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.4.2. Con: Feminism certainly does acknowledge women's sexist language and behaviours, such as highlighting the issue of "[horizontal hostility](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/judith.white/docs/1999_white_jsi.pdf)".
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.5. Con: Language/decorum policing is not in the stated purview of feminism. Inequality is. Thus feminists should focus on never using derogatory language themselves \(as demonstration\) instead of pointing out bad behavior in others as hateful, harmful, or "threatening".
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.5.1. Con: [Reappropriating/reclaiming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation) language can well be in the purview of feminism; it is a way to take threats and invert them.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.5.1.1. Con: Language is the function by which we all communicate. Reappropriation and reclamation of slurs does not provide for civility or the promotion of feminism.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.6. Pro: Similarly, women are still battling with bias in language as anything feminine is considered weak; i.e. "Don't be a girl about it."
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.9. Pro: A general "anti-prejudice movement" would be needed instead of feminism.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.9.1. Con: The goal of feminism is to achieve same prejudices for every person regardless of their gender rather than no prejudices at all.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.9.2. Con: The discrimination and prejudice which different groups face often have radically different origins and often manifests itself in different ways. In short, different marginalized groups face different issues and its impossible to simply homogenize oppression as one phenomena.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.10. Pro: Nowadays, feminism has lost its true purposes because it is still based on a sexual distinction which should be outdated for a real ethical progress of humanity.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.10.1. Con: Feminism has been increasingly [intersectional](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10572435/Intersectional-feminism.-What-the-hell-is-it-And-why-you-should-care.html) since the 90s.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.10.2. Con: For obvious biological reasons, the "sexual distinction" you mention will not disappear anytime soon; thus, it is unlikely it will ever become an outdated way of distinguishing between men and women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.10.3. Con: To achieve equity of all people \(no matter as whom they identify\) it is likely a good intermediate step to achieve equity between men and women. Equity for all could build up on that afterwards or in parallel.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.11. Con: Women still face double-standards with their sexual behaviour.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.11.1. Pro: It's seen as a positive for men to have many sexual partners, while women are degraded for exhibiting the same behaviours.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.8.1.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12. Con: Women are still subject to disproportionate and gendered physical violence in many instances.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.1. Con: While the violence inflicted upon each gender is disproportionate, feminism suppresses the fact that men suffer more violence and injurious accidents.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2. Con: This is questionable as men do not report attacks through fear of shame. Research such as that done by [Harvard](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/In_Brief_Domestic_violence_Not_always_one_sided) shows that it may actually be males who are more the victims.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1. Con: This proves that feminism is still needed, so men can feel more able to seek out help and report their attacks without it feeling shameful.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1. Con: Some branches of Feminism, and some feminists, however do nothing to help men and in fact go out of their way to shame and attack them.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.13.4.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.2. Pro: No more than [certain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misandry) branches of feminism are [tainted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-cant-we-hate-men/2018/06/08/f1a3a8e0-6451-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html)by [Misandry](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/understanding-the-erotic-code/201608/misandry-the-invisible-hatred-men), reinforce [negative](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/rethinking-men/201010/why-some-people-have-issues-men-misandry) stereotypes, spread [falsehoods](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/06/what-the-professor-who-hates-men-missed/562496/) and are almost militantly aggressive.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3. Pro: Statements of belief from feminists also include blatantly sexist and misandric principles. ... "I feel that 'man-hating' is an honourable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them." Robin Morgan \(1970\)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.1. Con: That quote specifically calls “man-hating” a political act, and one justified because of an oppressed classes hatred of their oppressors. Robin Morgan is decrying men for oppressing women, not decrying men.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Many beliefs have changed since 1970. One quote from one feminist, 47 years ago, is weak justification.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.1. Con: "All men are rapists and that's all they are." [Marilyn French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_French)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: According to the evidence it is a quote from a character in a book she wrote. Also "Rape" seems to be used as a metaphor. \(Though that could be subject to opinion.\) It's like saying Suzanne Collins claims she can turn into a mockingjay
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.2. Con: "I believe that women have a capacity for understanding and compassion which man structurally does not have, does not have it because he cannot have it. He's just incapable of it." Former Congresswoman [Barbara Jordan](https://www.forbes.com/2011/04/26/enough-with-the-male-bashing.html#732ee6766e5c).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.3. Con: "Probably the only place where a man can feel really secure is in a maximum security prison, except for the imminent threat of release." [Germaine Greer](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/510845-probably-the-only-place-where-a-man-can-feel-really)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.4. Con: "Men who are unjustly accused of rape can sometimes gain from the experience." [Catherine Comin](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,157165,00.html), Vassar College. Assistant Dean of Students.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.4.1. Con: This is not misandry. The full quote then runs: "I think it ideally initiates a process of self-exploration. 'How do I see women?' 'If I didn't violate her, could I have?' 'Do I have the potential to do to her what they say I did?' Those are good questions." It is not misandry but asking men to question themselves.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.4.1.1. Con: This is misandry - and essentially victim blaming. The core concept is that falsely accusing men of rape causes men to reflect on their own behavior. In other words - "did I cause this to happen?". Victim blaming is utterly reprehensible and should never be considered acceptable - let alone 'ideal' - in any context. The idea that it should be is misandric and fundamentally anti-feminist.

1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.6.1. Con: "Society for cutting up men" doesn't sound like a feminist group, therefore has no warrant in this discussion.

[Common phrase](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=a+woman%27s+faults+are+many+but+men+have+only+two+everything+they+say+and+everything+they+do&rlz=1C1CHBF_enAU795AU795&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZnuH9_fDdAhVPZt4KHevGBpgQsAR6BAgDEAE&biw=1366&bih=626)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.18. Con: I do want to be able to explain to a 9-year-old boy in terms he will understand why I think it’s OK for girls to wear shirts that revel in their superiority over boys. Treena Shapiro
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.19. Con: "I dared to suggest that we should take into account men's feelings and viewpoints on key feminist issues. "Men have had their voices heard for FAR TOO LONG! IT'S OUR TURN!" came the online battle cry, as though even garnering some male opinions would be a threat to womankind's empowerment" - Natasha Devon,[Modern feminism has got it wrong about men](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10831043/Modern-feminism-has-got-it-wrong-about-men.html)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.20. Con: Consider, for example, the number of neologisms that use "man" as a derogatory prefix and that have entered everyday media language: "mansplaining," "manspreading" and "manterrupting." - Cathy Young, [Feminists treat men badly and it's bad for feminism](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/feminists-treat-men-badly-and-its-bad-for-feminism-20160703-gpxbcp.html)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.2.21. Con: Attacking a claim based on how many examples it gives \(or assuming an example constitutes the entire body of available evidence\) is intellectually dishonest and a logical fallacy.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.3.3. Con: This is not an example of feminism becoming misandry, but rather an example of someone confusing the two.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.3. Pro: Women are [3 times](https://www.ourwatch.org.au/understanding-violence/facts-and-figures) more likely to be beaten at the hands of their male domestic partner than the other way around.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.4. Pro: Women still fear for their safety when rejecting romantic interest from male strangers \(See: [incel](http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/incel-meaning-explained)\)
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.4. Con: According to the [definition from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism), the goal of feminism is "\[...\] to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social equality of sexes"; hence, enhancing areas for men in which they are disadvantaged is a task of feminism too.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.2. Pro: There are multiple educational quotas that discriminate against men, even though [women do better in school on average](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2015/03/06/why-girls-do-better-at-school-than-boys).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.3. Con: In some cases, feminism also addresses men's issues.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.3.1. Pro: In a [famous speech about feminism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkjW9PZBRfk) Emma Watson talks about \(dis-\)advantages of both, men and women, resulting from inequality.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.3.2. Pro: Feminist politicians have fought for male parental leave, in Scandinavian countries
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.4. Con: The fact that men are not at the core of this movement does not mean it overlooks or ignores men.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.4.1. Pro: It's not necessarily the job of women to fight for men's issues; after all, men have the majority of the political power.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.4.1.1. Con: Feminism is not a movement by women, but by people from all sexes. Therefore at least a part of the feminist movement should take care of men's issues.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.4.1.2. Con: Everyone should try to make the world better for everyone. If one only helps others from the same group \(e.g. same gender\) minorities will be underprivileged.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.4.1.3. Con: Political power isn't the only thing needed for the goals of feminism. For instance stereotypes are hardly changed by political campaigns if the general public doesn't share the same ideas.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.4.1.4. Con: While the people with political power are more likely to be men, the average man has no more political power than the average woman. Simply sharing the gender of someone in power does not make someone's situation any better. The men in power do not represent the interests of disadvantaged men.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.4.1.4.1. Con: Since most of the people who have political power are men, all men's interests are represented in a way that women's interests are not.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5. Con: Men suffer negative consequences from the expectations and requirements placed on them by the patriarchy, which feminists are trying to dismantle.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.2. Pro: If a man dresses as a woman - notably skirts or dresses - he is seen as deviant or weak, whereas women are permitted to dress in typically masculine clothes like suits or trousers.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.3. Con: Feminists are not really trying to dismantle the patriarchy, they are propping up the areas of patriarchal gynocentrism that aid them, such as women's need to be protected \(DV propaganda\) and given special help \(female only scholarships, positive discrimination in hiring\).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4. Pro: Women are perceived as weak and unfit for dangerous roles, placing extra responsibilities and weight on men.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4.1. Pro: Men are seen or obliged to be the protectors of women and family, meaning they may feel obligated to risk their lives in combat or other dangerous activities.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4.2. Con: On average, [women are physically weaker than men](https://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/diet-fitness/personal-training/men-vs-women-upper-body-strength.htm). That is a consequence of human biology and has nothing to do with societal perceptions.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4.2.1. Pro: [Biologically](https://www.chronicle.com/forums/index.php?topic=30154.105;wap2), 90% of [women](https://www.quora.com/Are-men-generally-physically-stronger-than-women-Is-it-medically-proven-If-a-boy-and-girl-are-given-the-same-kind-of-training-from-childhood-will-they-become-players-of-the-same-quality-in-physical-sports) are physically weaker than 90% of men. This is [not sexist](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/hide-and-seek/201207/the-battle-the-sexes), it is a biological fact.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4.2.1.1. Con: Modern technology has made it that this physical disadvantage is not an actual disadvantage and women are just as capable, productive and efficient in these jobs and roles as men
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: In the military being physically weaker is not as much of a disadvantage as it once would have been when wars were fought with mainly melee combat. No longer having to wear armour, or wield a sword,where they would likely be over-powered by male combatants, or a heavy shield. A gun has equalised the role for men and women, as have planes, artillery etc.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Construction used to be manual labour, but now, at least in the western world, we have machines that anyone can operate, such as bulldozers, cranes, diggers and excavators, so these are things that require skill rather than strength.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4.2.1.1.3. Pro: Machinery lines now mean anyone is capable of operating the machinery, relying on skill and training, intelligence, rather than brawn.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4.2.1.2. Con: If someone had a physically demanding job, which are more likely to go to men, they would be more fit.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: If someone were convinced to do sports at school, which is more likely to happen for boys, they would be stronger.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4.2.1.2.2. Con: If a man and a woman do equal exercise, the man will still end up with greater muscle mass and strength than the woman due to basic physiological differences in structure.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.6. Pro: Some feminists, such as Mary Koss, have discriminated against male victims of domestic and sexual violence.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.6.1. Con: Few feminists have these views, Mary Koss is not a popular 'feminist'.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.6.2. Pro: [Mary Koss](https://toysoldier.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/mary-koss-doesnt-think-women-can-rape-men-and-boys/) does not believe that the rape experiences of men are equatable to that of women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.6.2.1. Con: An individual's views on the matter does not speak for the whole of the feminist movement.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.6.3. Pro: Mary Koss generally [excludes men](http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf) from her definition of rape victims \(p.206-7\).
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.7. Pro: Breast cancer research receives more [funding](http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/05/breast-cancer-receives-much-more-research-funding-publicity-than-prostate-cancer-despite-similar-number-of-victims/) than prostate cancer research despite a similar number of victims.
1.5.4.4.3.5.3.7.1. Con: Breast cancer is not exclusive to women.
1.5.4.4.3.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.
1.5.4.4.3.5.5. Con: Feminists have directly protested, [campaigned against politically](https://globalnews.ca/news/1676642/controversial-centre-for-men-opens-in-toronto-amid-criticism/), and even [doxxed](http://www.inside-man.co.uk/2016/02/16/4655/) other groups seeking to address inequalities of their own, including male suicide and male mentoring groups, and the opening of men's homeless shelters.
1.5.4.4.4. Pro: Problems facing women or around gender and equality can be tackled on a by issue basis. This has many advantages.
1.5.4.4.4.1. Pro: This type of campaigning could enlist people put off by feminism, its ideology, or reputation.
1.5.4.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.2.
1.5.4.4.5. Con: The perspective of feminism, which targets injustices that uniquely affect women, has resources that other approaches lack.
1.5.4.4.5.1. Pro: There is an international network of feminist activism, which feminists can work with when combating injustice.
1.5.4.4.5.2. Pro: There is a whole body of feminist literature and theory which can inform activists working from this perspective.
1.5.4.4.5.2.1. Con: Feminist literature, theory and activism are not reliable ways of knowing the reality of injustices or for making just changes. Much work done in the past is suspect and needs to be filtered by a scientific process, at the minimum, or redone entirely in the worst case scenario.
1.5.4.4.5.3. Con: These resources could be reallocated to egalitarian organizations that would accomplish more good for more people.
1.5.4.4.5.3.1. Con: Egalitarian organizations are not inherently more effective at advocating for the rights of their constituents than their feminist counterparts. Thus, simply reallocating resources from the latter to the former is not an obvious recipe for success.
1.5.4.4.6. Pro: Other groups are also fighting against violent abuse of women and are more effective than feminists. Law enforcement, the U.S. military, the American Bar Association, the Battered Women's Justice Project, just to name a few.
1.5.5. Pro: Feminism helps to challenge and dismantle sexist stereotypes.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Femininity is typically seen as weaker and inferior to masculinity.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.2.
1.5.5.2. Pro: Due to gender stereotypes, women do a greater share of parenting and household duties, jobs that are not remunerated and impede women from spending time advancing their careers.
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: New mothers allocate [twice as much](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4578481/) of their available time to routine child care activities than fathers.
1.5.5.2.2. Con: This division in parenting duties is in large part due to biological differences and preferences.
1.5.5.2.2.1. Pro: [In chimpanzees](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC22663/) the male does negligible parental care.
1.5.5.2.2.2. Con: Modern societies have developed to a level of sophistication that is able to override historical biological and physiological traits for the good of societal functioning and liberalism.
1.5.5.2.3. Con: Men often do much more difficult, [dangerous](http://publication/equal-pay-day-this-year-is-april-12-the-next-equal-occupational-fatality-day-will-be-in-the-year-2027/) work.
1.5.5.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.1.
1.5.5.2.4. Pro: [A study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170926105448.htm) finds that Canadian women of all ages still tend to do more household chores than their male partners, no matter how much they work or earn in a job outside the home.
1.5.5.2.5. Pro: [The Office for National Statistics](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37941191) in the UK found that women are doing almost 40% more than men on average in unpaid household chores.
1.5.5.2.6. Pro: In the US, [a study found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4131769/) that among married or partnered subjects with children, after adjustment for work hours, spousal employment, and other factors, women spent 8.5 more hours per week on domestic activities.
1.5.5.3. Con: Patriarchy is not real. The gender role imposed on men is not being rulers but \(sometimes disposable\) protectors and providers. That's not only promoted by men but also by women as it has many advantages for them.
1.5.5.3.1. Con: That men are seen as protectors and that this can disadvantage them is a part of the patriarchy concept.
1.5.5.3.2. Con: The patriarchy idea doesn't suggest that all men are rulers, simply that male is the dominant gender in general, and masculinity is preferred over femininity.
1.5.5.3.3. Pro: Men are often seen as disposable in society as evidenced by the huge amount of male fatalities over time in war.
1.5.5.4. Con: Strict gender roles are not enforced in Western society.
1.5.5.4.1. Pro: Both women and men are free to seek whatever employment and educational opportunities they deem fit.
1.5.5.4.2. Pro: Both sexes are free to stay home and raise children.
1.5.5.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.2.1.
1.5.5.4.3. Con: There are often gendered dress codes in work. Men aren't typically allowed to wear skirts to work for example.
1.5.5.4.3.1. Pro: In France, male bus drivers [protested](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/22/french-bus-drivers-skirts-dress-code-nantes) against gendered dress codes by wearing skirts to work, having been forbidden from wearing shorts despite extreme temperatures.
1.5.5.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.2.
1.5.5.4.4. Con: While free to do so, breaking out of traditional gender roles in Western society still attracts criticism, for the man who wishes to stay at home and take on the parent role, and for the woman who decides to have a career instead of being at home with the kids, or if she chooses not to have children at all. The laws might have changed, but attitudes haven't.
1.5.6. Pro: Feminism is needed to address the practical rights that women have been denied.
1.5.6.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.
1.5.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.
1.5.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.2.
1.5.6.4. Pro: Feminism fights to give women equal legal rights.
1.5.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.4.
1.5.6.4.2. Con: In the Western world, women already have equal legal rights.
1.5.6.4.3. Con: Feminism is a harmful bias in law making.
1.5.6.4.3.1. Pro: Feminism in many countries promotes laws that favor women against men´s rights. [Spanish Gender equality and violence laws are an example.](http://justiciadegenero.com/en/analysis-of-8-years-of-gender-violence-law-in-spain/)
1.5.6.4.3.2. Con: If law makers were the opposite of feminists, they would be extremely biased and very harmful to the population.
1.5.6.4.3.3. Con: Equality cannot be biased.
1.5.6.4.3.4. Con: Feminism is needed in many [countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia#Driving).
1.5.6.4.3.5. Con: Feminism is defined as "the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes", and has nothing to do with unfair lawmaking.
1.5.6.4.3.5.1. Con: One way to advocate for any group \(minority or not\) is to push for new legislation protecting its constituents' rights.
1.5.6.4.3.5.2. Con: Theoretical definitions can be wrong or not correlate with the practical effects of the movement in the real world, or with how some people use the term to motivate actions that differ a lot from the supposed original goal or definition.
1.5.6.4.3.6. Pro: Feminism supports the introduction of gender quotas, which would not encourage equality but would force people to discriminate based on gender.
1.5.6.4.3.6.1. Con: [Not all feminists support quotas](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/gender-quotas-are-an-insult-to-women/19198#.WxABMFMvzRY).
1.5.6.4.3.6.2. Pro: Gender quotas inherently aim to achieve equality of outcome, with potentially counterproductive results.
1.5.6.4.3.6.2.1. Pro: Government-dictated quotas ultimately reduce people to numbers, restricting their opportunities and disregarding their skillsets, qualifications, and aspirations when it comes to job placement.
1.5.6.4.3.6.3. Con: Women are systemically excluded from positions of power by norms which demean ambitious women as bossy, structures that make workplaces inhospitable, and socio-economic inequalities. Quotas in places such as boardrooms and [legislatures](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/11/10/why-quotas-are-needed-to-achieve-gender-equality/?utm_term=.356bf73c6ee1) helps to level the playing field for women.
1.5.6.4.3.7. Pro: Feminism can become a profitable trend in [corrupted family court](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl-cTa-mau8)s, and promote [disempowerment of men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqCaxtdHwCc); while currently seen almost exclusively in Israel, it should not be dismissed as a concern.
1.5.6.4.3.8. Pro: Paternity laws commonly [discriminate](https://dadsdivorce.com/articles/harsh-laws-that-discriminate-against-men-and-fathers/) against men, many of which are supported by feminist groups such as the [National Organization of Women](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/07/14/paternity-innocence-is-now-defense.html).
1.5.6.4.3.8.1. Pro: The law and feminists are staunchly against [a man's right to choose](https://www.salon.com/2000/10/19/mens_choice/) fatherhood.
1.5.6.4.3.8.2. Pro: [Women's rights groups](https://nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/20980-as-it-was-and-ever-shall-be-now-opposes-equal-rights-for-fathers) [have fought](http://www.uticaod.com/news/20171231/shared-parenting-bills-could-reshape-custody-battles) [against](https://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/opposing-shared-parenting-the-feminist-track-record/) shared parenting legislation.
1.5.6.4.3.9. Pro: Feminists [have opposed](http://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/1120821/drafting-women) equality in the draft.
1.5.6.4.3.9.1. Con: Many feminists have been advocating for including women in the draft [for decades](https://now.org/resource/issue-advisory-women-and-the-draft-moving-two-steps-closer-to-equality/).
1.5.6.4.3.9.2. Con: [Some feminists argue](http://bust.com/feminism/16574-why-drafting-women-isn-t-gender-equality.html) that the draft strips people of rights. Rather than fighting for it to include women, they fight for it to be eliminated altogether.
1.5.6.4.3.9.3. Con: Feminism comes in many flavours. There are feminist groups who applaud feminism in the sense of full equality, even when it does not nescessarily benefit the female. The latter applauds draft equality.
1.5.6.4.3.10. Pro: The National Organization for Women [blasted efforts](http://ncfm.org/2012/06/news/domestic-abuse-violence/the-national-coalition-for-women-blasts-efforts-to-include-sensible-and-gender-inclusive-provisions-in-legislation-to-reauthorize-the-violence-against-women-act/) to [include](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/4970/text) [gender inclusive language](https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/2876/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22violence+against+women%22%5D%7D&r=84) in the Violence Against Women Act.
1.5.6.4.3.11. Con: The [legal system](http://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2009/08/federal-court-demographics-changing-to.php) and [government](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-10-24/despite-diverse-demographics-most-politicians-are-still-white-men) in the United States are overwhelmingly dominated by \(white\) men. These systems are and have been biased against women. If feminism counteracts such biases by demanding equality of rights, then this should be seen as welcome.
1.5.6.4.3.11.1. Con: The fact that a homogeneous group is in a position of power does not necessarily translate in biased lawmaking for the minority du jour.
1.5.6.4.3.11.2. Con: Representation does not equate to equality. Demanding equality of rights necessarily requires that all parties involved are held to the same standard.
1.5.6.5. Pro: Fewer women hold positions of power. Feminism fights to change that.
1.5.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.5.7.2.
1.5.6.5.2. Con: That fewer women hold positions of power is simply a reflection of women's life choices, rather than evidence of systemic discrimination.
1.5.6.5.2.1. Pro: Women take time off to be with their children, and extended maternity leave.
1.5.7. Con: -> See 1.5.4.4.
1.6. Con: Feminism lowers public will to discuss the equity of the sexes
1.6.1. Con: Feminism provides a platform for the discussion of equality between the sexes
1.6.2. Con: The public or individuals' wills are already low because it's not a fun problem to fix. Most privileged people will get defensive and have sensations of guilt and persecution when they are made aware of the unfairness. The changes to ones' life may be significant, to achieve fairness.
1.6.3. Con: For a long time discussions on gender equality have only been about feminism. Because of feminism the discussion is on the rise.
1.6.4. Pro: Feminism would be easier to talk about if there was not so much anger, and it was truly aimed to help the lower classes.
1.6.4.1. Con: The anger is because of sexism, not because of feminism. If there were no grievances that anger some people, feminism would have no reason to exist.
1.6.4.2. Con: Suggesting that anger from oppressed groups silences debate ignores the fact that oppressive systems use any means to silence the oppressed, regardless of the emotions of the oppressed.
1.6.5. Con: Feminism is simply defined as the will to fight for women's equal rights; Any discussion of fighting for women's rights is at some level, feminist.
1.6.5.1. Con: Individuals themselves could still fight for women's rights via political activism or by trying to influence legislature, rather than under the umbrella of feminism.
1.6.5.2. Con: People advocated for the advancement of women's rights before feminism, and if it should cease to exist tomorrow, people would still advocate for the advancement of women's rights. Feminism is an umbrella of ideologies, and those ideologies do not have a monopoly on the advocacy of women's rights towards gender equality.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: Using a definition of a word like "feminism" that's preferred by non-feminists instead of the definition of feminism that a growing and evolving group of people have chosen for themselves shows a bias against them, not an understanding of the movement.
1.6.5.2.2. Con: It's perfectly normal to describe people from the past using words that had not yet been invented, and it is still true if the definition of the word suits the circumstances. \(Sometimes it's absolutely necessary, if the person lived before your own language existed\)
1.6.5.3. Con: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.
1.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.2.
1.6.7. Con: This is simply a branding problem that is rectifiable.
1.6.7.1. Con: The branding is not rectifiable, without actually renaming feminism to something like egalitarianism.
1.6.7.2. Con: The problem is that "Feminism" is the brand.
1.6.7.2.1. Pro: Feminism is a gendered term of gendered origin that denotes 'female'.
1.6.7.2.2. Pro: Feminism is now too broad a term, ill-defined and diverse, meaning it is often misunderstood.
1.6.7.2.2.1. Pro: The broadness of the word feminism allows for extremists who identify as feminists to shelter themselves in the movement. The effect is to tarnish the entire feminist movement, which in turn has a negative effect on female equality.
1.6.7.2.2.1.1. Pro: Feminists such as Monique Wittig have undermined various traditional tenants of feminism, [such as insisting lesbians are not women.](https://www.kialo.com/lesbians-are-not-women-8720/8720.0=8720.1/=8720.1)
1.6.7.2.2.1.2. Pro: The movement either needs to call out its own extremists or re-brand itself, like how some people are calling themselves "egalitarians" instead of feminists, despite having the same viewpoints. Such individuals feel like feminists are pushing for a matriarchal society, instead of a society which doesn't differentiate between sexes.
1.6.7.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Re-branding is the best approach, since there are too many factions within feminism for any one to claim authority.
1.6.7.2.2.1.3. Con: All popular movements that gain traction are vulnerable to being mixed up with extremist branches that tarnish the entire movement. It is a part of popular movements that should not minimise the value of the movement's core tenets and achievements.
1.6.7.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: The men's rights movement is tainted by misogyny: "Misogynists in the men's rights movement 
[spread falsehoods](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2012/men%E2%80%99s-rights-movement-spreads-false-claims-about-women) about women".
1.6.7.2.2.1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.12.2.1.1.2.
1.6.7.2.2.2. Con: This seems to be an inevitable part of any large social and political movement. To get the changes and benefits offered by organised political action one must accept a movement will spawn extremists and some undesirable actions. Arguments will almost certainly occur over definitions and focus.
1.6.7.2.2.3. Pro: The word feminism has been used so much as a derogatory term that the word has come to mean something entirely different; its purpose is to acknowledge that prejudices in history have been mainly toward women, and recognising that, so we can pursue equality between everyone.
1.6.7.2.2.3.1. Con: "Feminism" as a derogatory term is not a universal experience, but some people's most frequent encounters with feminists are in outrageous stories from anti-feminist or sensationalist news and entertainment. Even if 80% of self-identified feminists might agree that a story shows a feminist doing wrong and wouldn't support it, observers inside the bubble wouldn't see that, whereas self described feminists are likely recognize it as outlier behavior, misguided youths or cartoon feminists.
1.6.7.2.2.3.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that many feminists are even aware of their own bias and the problems in their methodology. A [recent study](https://www.thecollegefix.com/study-dog-parks-are-manifestations-of-rape-culture-and-oppression/) by a [group of academics](https://www.thecollegefix.com/hoax-project-gets-a-woke-version-of-mein-kampf-accepted-by-feminist-journal/) has shown that many [groups with an agenda](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/06/20/academic-journal-publishes-study-on-dog-rape-culture-claims-female-dogs-are-oppressed/)will [publish anything](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4954000/Academics-say-gender-expectations-turning-dogs-crazy.html) that supports their view, regardless of how preposterous, without proper questioning or vetting, because it supports their narrative.
1.6.7.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: There are [reasons](https://twitter.com/lakens/status/1047454051661762560) to believe this studies had some value besides the narrative to be accepted, and the reporting of the papers has not been [very accurate](http://michaelkeenan.tumblr.com/post/178734541040/tldr-this-latest-academic-journal-hoax-is)
1.6.7.2.2.3.1.1.2. Con: The problem of [publishing fake data](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/01/high-tech-war-on-science) \(which is the main problem about this studies getting accepted\) is not a problem only in feminist journals, but related to the methodology and problems of journals in general and the [motivations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_misconduct#Motivation_to_commit_scientific_misconduct) to do it
1.6.7.2.2.4. Pro: Feminism has been claimed by groups that have completely opposite and incompatible goals about the core meaning of feminism and the essence of its main topic: gender.
1.6.7.2.2.5. Con: Nearly all terms lack clarity without context. The meaning of terms such as "democracy," "equality," and numerous others are all disputed.
1.6.7.2.2.5.1. Con: Most terms \(including 'democracy' and 'gender equality'\) don't incorporate completely opposite and incompatible goals at the same time over their main issue. While they promote one main goal, the debate is over the details on how to incorporate that common goal.
1.6.7.3. Pro: Feminism is based on a fundamentally just concept: equality between men and women.
1.6.7.3.1. Con: It cannot be based on the concept of equality, because that concept is too vague.
1.6.7.3.1.1. Pro: It means different things to different people at different times \(eg. equality of opportunity Vs equality of outcome\) and can't be applied effectively either conceptually or practically to such a large and diverse group as the female half of the population.
1.6.7.3.2. Con: If all men are not equal to each other, and all women are not equal to each other, then in no possible way can all men and all women be equal to each other.
1.6.7.3.3. Pro: Feminism's roots are founded on this concept of equality.
1.6.7.3.3.1. Pro: Feminism grew out of the [Civil Rights movement](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lynn-yeakel/march-on-washington_b_3769211.html).
1.6.7.3.3.2. Pro: The [early history](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-topics/) of feminist movements were founded on ideas of equality: "after the First International Women's Conference in Paris in 1892 \[...\] the term, following the French term féministe, was used regularly in English for a belief in and advocacy of equal rights for women based on the idea of the equality of the sexes".
1.6.7.3.3.2.1. Con: This may be the early intentions of feminism, but it doesn't necessarily mean that contemporary feminism is still based on the same just concept.
1.6.7.3.3.3. Con: The movement was given the name ‘feminism’ because it focuses on the gender inequality issues that impact women. The branding should not be confused with other rights movement ideologies such as Egalitarianism or Humanism, which seek to address inequalities impacting both genders.
1.6.7.3.4. Con: If feminism were based on gender equality it would also demand women to be treated equally in disadvantageous situation where they currently are relatively advantaged.
1.6.7.3.4.1. Con: This assumes that current forms of feminism are selective in their demand for equal opportunity in historically male-dominated professions.
1.6.7.3.4.2. Con: Feminists were the ones who made woman's drinking age increase to 21 to be the same as mens.
1.6.7.3.4.3. Pro: Women are not equally scouted for military service in many countries.
1.6.7.3.4.3.1. Con: Feminists have campaigned for women's inclusion in the military, including [combat roles.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/06/feminism-women-army-combat-roles)
1.6.7.3.4.3.2. Con: Conscripting women creates a number of problems separate to feminism or equality, such as: dependents \(conscripting both parents in one family would be bad\), child-bearing, pregnancies, breast feeding, and the removal of choice to raise a family \(a woman has a limited number of child-bearing years\).
1.6.7.3.4.4. Pro: Women are less like to be assigned to high risk physical jobs.
1.6.7.3.4.5. Pro: Women are more likely to receive [child custody following divorce.](https://www.divorcenet.com/resources/divorce/for-men/divorce-for-men-why-women-get-child-custody-over-80-time)
1.6.7.3.4.5.1. Con: The discrimination in custody battles is [not brought on](https://queerguesscode.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/the-truth-about-feminism-and-child-custody-discrimination/) by feminism.
1.6.7.3.4.5.2. Con: The concept of feminism dictates that the woman shouldn't be the default carer. In an equal society, judgements made regarding child custody would depend on the parent\(s\) who desired it and who is best suited for the task. Financial stability, mental health, a support network, etc, should all be the factors in child custody. Not gender.
1.6.7.3.4.6. Con: The situations where women are kept from dangerous labour or military jobs are based on sexist ideas that women are weak, but those dangerous jobs are also oppressive and sexist by nature.
1.6.7.3.4.6.1. Con: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.5.4.2.1.
1.6.7.3.5. Pro: Feminism does not mean women should be held above men, it means being treated equally, and not condescendingly.
1.6.7.3.5.1. Con: Most definitions of feminism include a recognition of the political activism that's a core of the movement. Someone may broadly support equality but not wish to identify with the activism of feminism.
1.6.7.3.5.2. Con: Modern third wave and [intersectional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) feminism contain a complex set of political and social assumptions and are at the mainstream of contemporary feminist activism. Many people may disavow the label feminist as they disagree with this movement, despite supporting equality.
1.6.7.3.5.3. Con: Equality between the sexes can mean a lot of different things. Equal rights to vote and consideration under the law is different from enforced quotas for certain jobs. People may support some applications of equality, but not others, and distance themselves from feminism for this reason.
1.6.7.3.5.4. Con: While one's deeds and words can, through timing, tone, and connotation, be received in a variety of manners, condescension is also based on potentially biased or inaccurate perceptions of the recipient.
1.6.7.3.6. Con: There are comparatively better ways to believe in equality than being a feminist.
1.6.7.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.
1.6.7.3.6.2. Pro: Liberalism already predicates equality under the law for all human beings, and does so before feminism. Feminism, on the other hand, places the focus on a group, switching the terms of the argument from universal to group-based recognition. This is a trojan horse for an awful, primitive thought-process that inevitably will, in the long run, work against equality.
1.6.7.3.6.3. Con: Believing in equality between men and women, [by definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism) makes a person a feminist. Just because someone is uncomfortable or unfamiliar using the term doesn't make it less true.
1.6.7.3.7. Con: Feminism doesn't seek true gender equality, but aims to disadvantage men in order to promote its own agenda.
1.6.7.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.4.3.1.
1.6.7.3.7.2. Pro: [Prominent feminists](https://thoughtcatalog.com/jake-fillis/2014/05/23-quotes-from-feminists-that-will-make-you-rethink-feminism/) have made anti-male statements.
1.6.7.3.7.2.1. Con: Source lacks evidence any of them are true. The internet often makes up stories: [Example that won't cause anger.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/german-fuel-protest-image/)
1.6.7.3.7.3. Pro: Feminists want men to become feminised.
1.6.7.3.7.3.1. Con: It’s sexist to imply that men being effeminate is a negative thing. Men should be encouraged to be feminised because the theory that men should be strong and emotionless is outdated and damaging.
1.6.7.3.7.4. Pro: Feminists oppose and actively fight against men's rights.
1.6.7.3.7.4.1. Pro: Feminists protest [men's rights events.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/29/mens-rights-conference_n_5405300.html)
1.6.7.3.7.4.1.1. Con: That is better described as a "[Mens rights over woman's event](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/mens-rights-conference_n_5405300)" or something along the lines of how they're trying to give men more rights than woman. Any group wanting equality would protest them.
1.6.7.3.7.4.2. Con: It is not men's rights that feminists oppose, but the misogyny and sexism in those movements.
1.6.7.3.7.4.3. Con: -> See 1.6.7.2.2.1.3.1.
1.6.7.3.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.4.3.5.3.1.3.2.2.1.4.2.
1.6.7.3.7.6. Pro: The term 'feminism' suggests promoting women over men.
1.6.7.3.7.6.1. Con: Feminism is a combination of the word feminine and the suffix _ism_. Feminine is derived from the Latin [femina](https://www.etymonline.com/word/feminine) which means woman/female. [Ism](https://www.etymonline.com/word/-ism)is from the Greek word ismos, meaning the practice or teaching of a thing. Basically, the etymology of feminism gives us "the philosophy of women" or "female thought." 
There is nothing about the term that suggests promoting women over men.
1.6.7.3.7.6.2. Con: The dictionary definition of [feminism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/feminism) is the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.
There is nothing about the term that suggests promoting women over men.
1.6.7.3.7.7. Con: Current feminism does not oppress men, but rather critiques the power relations and male privilege that is taken for granted. It is the responsibility of the subject to be aware of privilege. Of course if one is not perceived do so and think critically, others will do it on their behalf.
1.6.7.3.7.8. Con: Feminism is about equality of the sexes and any anti-male statements are not feminism but misandry - which should be discouraged.
1.6.7.3.7.9. Con: Though some feminists are anti-male, feminism itself is not based on anti-maleness.
1.6.7.3.7.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.3.3.
1.6.7.3.7.9.2. Con: Until Feminism actively seeks to eradicate those anti-male feminist voices, it will be based in part on anti-maleness.
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.1. Con: This is a like hasty generalisation logical fallacy, except worse because it is common knowledge that those feminists are a minority. This is like calling all men rapists because less than 90% of men are trying to stop rape.
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.1.1. Con: And yet, some noteable Feminists, such as [Susan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Brownmiller) [Brownmiller,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Our_Will) do claim that all men are rapists. Other [less noteable](https://medium.com/\@annetteinafrica/all-men-are-potential-rapists-399176050f3) ones have made [similar claims](https://citizen.co.za/news/opinion/opinion-columns/1916142/not-all-of-us-menaretrash/), while rejecting "[not all men](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rape_culture)" defences.
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.1.1.1. Con: And notable men commit or admit to sexual assault. Bill Cosby, Donald Trump, likely Brett Kavanaugh, aka people we've heard of. Both calling all men rapists and calling feminism sexist is a hasty generalisation.
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.1.1.2. Con: Susan Brownmiller's quote was misinterpreted.
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.1.1.2.1. Con: This is a disingenuous interpretation of the quote. If rape is the conscious conspiracy by ALL men, then that is saying that all men are \(potential\) rapists and part of the conspiracy of rape against women. The reason for it \(fear/intimidation\) is beside the point, the ultimate process \(rape\) is what is important here. And in that she accuses all men, without exception.
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Most woman will have a friend who has been raped, they should be thinking that any stranger they see could rape them, the same way a lot of people wouldn't want a snake interacting with them even though they won't necessarily bite. For some woman it will be a fear they've learned to get over time, but a rational one.
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: The [quote](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/99474-against-our-will-men-women-and-rape) “\[Rape is\] nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation" \(Which notably does NOT claim that all men are rapists\) "by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.”
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: [Whole](http://ttp://www.susanbrownmiller.com/susanbrownmiller/html/against_our_will.htm) quote from Susan Brownmiller is: "Man's discovery that his genitalia could serve as a weapon to prehistoric times, along with the use of fire and the first crude stone axe. From prehistoric times to the present, I believe, rape has played a critical function. It is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear."
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.1.1.3. Con: [medium.com](https://medium.com/\@annetteinafrica/all-men-are-potential-rapists-399176050f3) talks about men's reactions:" “Are you calling ME a rapist?” First of all, no." So obviously they do NOT say that all men are rapists, they are saying "All men are potential rapists" to show that many woman walking down the streets have to think like that, because they've been in that scenario and have been raped before.
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.1.1.3.1. Con: This however misses the point and even denies the language is triggering, in the same way as if someone said "all women are potential child abusers" because the larger percentage of non-sexual abuse against children is by women, and all are capable of and have the equipment to abuse a child. It's an absurd and deliberately provocative claim that could be chosen or worded more carefully. But it wasn't. Because it was designed to be triggering and provocative.
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.1.1.4. Con: The rejection of "Not all men" isn't to defend the statement "all men are rapists", rather it's pointing out that anyone who claims it is missing the point and shutting down the practical discussions that can be had because of it. \(At least in the evidence shown by the parent.\)
1.6.7.3.7.9.2.2. Con: No social movement exists as a single cohesive unit with homogeneous views and ideas. It is as unreasonable to consider feminism "anti-male" due to the views of some members as it is to dismiss all men's rights activists as "misogynists" because of the views of a few members.
1.6.7.3.7.10. Con: Feminism isn't a specific set of rules that every feminist must believe in.
1.6.7.3.8. Con: Equality is not a desirable goal as men and women are different.
1.6.7.3.8.1. Pro: Men and women [are closer](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/14/chimp_genome_y_chromosome_gumble) in terms of their DNA to their corresponding primate gender than to the opposite human sex.
1.6.7.3.8.2. Con: The idea that gender or sex is a binary [Is outdated](https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2015/02/24/sex-biology-redefined-genes-dont-indicate-binary-sexes/), even genetics recognizes more than two possabilities for chromosomal set and questions if genes are the primary element in defining sex. Rendering any debate centred on the dichotomy of men and women unnuanced.
1.6.7.3.8.2.1. Pro: Differences in Sexual Development \(DSDs\) occur in [1 in 100](https://childrensnational.org/choose-childrens/conditions-and-treatments/diabetes-hormonal-disorders/differences-in-sex-development) live births.
1.6.7.3.8.3. Pro: Differences within the human species demonstrates clear differences between physiological and [psychological differences between men and women](http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=6390).
1.6.7.3.8.4. Pro: The concept of equality is unfair to the individuals whose greater needs or merits aren't recognized.
1.6.7.3.8.5. Pro: Equality, unlike equity, implies no recognition of natural or developed differences between individuals based on an abstract and vague ideal of social group.
1.6.7.3.8.5.1. Con: Feminism is not contingent on women and men being exactly the same. Even if biological differences in abilities and preferences exist between women and men, it doesn't change the core values of feminism, which is that women should have the same rights to autonomy and personhood that men do.
1.6.7.3.8.6. Con: Equality can be understood to be equality of opportunities and equity in the respect given to both genders.
1.6.7.3.8.6.1. Con: Through individual and culturally reinforced bias, respect given is received by each of us differently - as well as by whom the respect is given, how it is presented, and how it was earned.
1.6.7.3.8.6.2. Pro: Understanding that equality is referring to opportunity indicates that gender representation levels do not reflect equality in the literal feminist sense.
1.6.7.3.8.7. Con: We may not be able to achieve absolute level of equality of outcome, if this was even desirable, for everyone. We could, however, get to high levels of equality of opportunity.
1.6.7.3.8.7.1. Pro: Equality of oppourtunity has increased for many formerly marginalised groups already.
1.6.7.3.8.8. Pro: Demanding something impossible \(equality\) is fundamentally unjust.
1.6.7.3.8.8.1. Con: Changing an attitude or an opinion is not impossible. Society has demonstrated on multiple occasions throughout history that different values can be adopted. Equality is simply another set of values that could potentially come to fruition.
1.6.7.3.8.8.2. Con: Achieving 100% equality of the sexes may not be possible, but it is still a just cause worth fighting for.
1.6.7.3.8.8.2.1. Con: If it has been established that equality is inherently unjust, a just cause cannot simultaneously be unjust, thus not worth fighting for.
1.6.7.3.8.8.3. Pro: Demanding the impossible puts unfair constraints on those that fight for those ends.
1.6.7.3.8.8.4. Pro: Demanding the impossible means never achieving one's goals, but likely incurring costs along the way.
1.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.2.2.
1.7. Con: Feminism is a harmful political force.
1.7.1. Con: Feminism is concerned with addressing female under-representation in government so that the law-making process can benefit from female perspectives.
1.7.1.1. Con: We don’t specifically need the female perspective, as we should trust our legislators to be fair and empathetic to other groups in their legislation.
1.7.2. Con: Feminism seeks to address existing bias whereby male candidates are viewed more favourably for leadership roles regardless of experience, qualification, and overall merit.
1.7.3. Con: It is not harmful per se, but is prone to corruption and manipulation , just like any other movement
1.7.4. Con: Any movement which encourages equality, i.e women’s right to vote, is not a harmful political force but a positive one.
1.7.4.1. Con: Voting rights \(or suffrage\) for women in North America was won a long time ago \(20th century\). While it qualifies as a definite win for feminism, the feminist movement in North America has long since moved on to other political ambitions.
1.7.4.2. Con: Feminists separate themselves by hurting the position of men under the guise of fighting patriarchy
1.7.4.2.1. Con: A movement encouraging slavery of men is both not feminism and does not follow from the initial statement that forces promoting gender equality are good.
1.7.4.3. Pro: Gender equality benefits women, men and non-binary people and gives people freedom on an individual level instead of being limited or subject of pre-existing prejudice and generalization.
1.7.4.4. Con: Communism wanted to make everyone economically equal. However it also killed millions of people.
1.7.4.4.1. Con: This is an anthropomorphism. Communism is a political theory. Perhaps some communists have killed people, but I'm not sure how that is relevant.
1.7.5. Pro: Modern \(mostly third wave\) feminism is part of a politically and socially harmful postmodernist movement, sometimes referred to as "Cultural Marxism".
1.7.5.1. Con: Skepticism, which is a core attitude of postmodernism, is critical for discussions and therefore essential for progress.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: Postmodern scepticism simply goes against scientific models that make progress possible. Postmodernism won´t bring us iphones or drones, it could just give us the moral relativism that make nihilism and massive shootings common.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.
1.7.7. Pro: Feminist ideas dominate other political agendas, such as the question of gender in a certain role being more important than merits.
1.7.7.1. Pro: Positive discrimination is ineffective and in the case of feminism, defeats the point. Women want to be acknowledged as people and not just because they are a woman.
1.7.7.1.1. Con: You could only say it's self defeating if women weren't starting off from a disadvantaged position. People who have habitually overlooked women \(consciously or unconsciously\) don't need to ask anyone, analyze their decision making, or advertise what they've done. The existing problem has needed direct attention.
