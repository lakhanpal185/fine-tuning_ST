Discussion Title: Does Morality Precede Religion?

1. Morality precedes Religion
1.1. Con: Religion precedes ethics. The determination of what is right and wrong is based on religious beliefs \(i.e. human sacrifices is good in Aztecs, while it is not in Christian teaching\).
1.1.1. Con: This only suggests that religion may twist ethic perception, as ceremonial sacrifice does not appear to occur naturally \(without religion involved\). Outside of religious fervor, sacrified people and their kin and family may not find their situation that "good".
1.1.2. Con: The determination of what is right or wrong is based on [ethical frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics). There are many such frameworks and religion is only one category \(with subdivisions in specific denominations that do not necessarily share the same [normative ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics)\) among many others.
1.1.3. Con: A sense of morality and ethics most likely preceded organized religion, but religion can serve to codify which morals and values carry the most weight in a society. As an example, the Aztec, Maya and dozens of other societies saw human sacrifice as essential for the continuance of the universe but it would be wrong to conclude that all Aztec were born with an innate comfort with sacrifice.
1.1.4. Con: You justify that religion is "the determination of what is right and wrong" yet blatantly contradicts your example of human sacrifices. The fact that religion made the aztecs thought that human sacrifices are "good" \(or Christians thinking that taking away the rights of homosexuals is a good thing\) is a testament that Religion makes things look right even if they are wrong. Religion does not produce morality, it was made to control \("Religio", meaning bound, restrain\).
1.2. Con: Religion decides what ought to be, science decides only what is.
1.2.1. Con: Nobody decides anything. Science observes what is. Philosophy wonders why anything is. Religion veils what is.
1.3. Pro: People cannot exist in a society without a moral code in order to promote cooperation and trust. Religion is developed from the moral code in order to ensure obedience.
1.3.1. Con: Not if you take into account Theistic Evolution. If this was the case, then it was a God who deemed it so our species could evolve through religion, which then gave us our moral code, deeply rooted into our subconsciousness through narrative archetypes.
1.3.1.1. Con: Being unable to determine that theistic evolution is true \(it's unfalsifiable\), this claim doesn't lead to any constructive conclusion.
1.3.2. Con: A moral code is not subjective to obedience. "Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The obedient must be slaves." -Henry David Thoreau- Likewise, Morality is not subjective to Religion.
1.4. Pro: Philosophy has laid a moral foundation which can exist without religious dogma.
1.4.1. Con: Philosophy evolved from religion, not the other way around, suggesting that morality evolved from religion.
1.4.1.1. Con: Basic morality is an evolutionary adaptation, that may be traced back to the need of our ancestors to survive in small groups in Savannah and ultimately to [the selfish gene theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene-centered_view_of_evolution#Selfish-gene_theory).
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Some aspects of morallity are observed even in non-human animals, e.g. [bonobo and chimpanzees](http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/chimps_and_bonobos_prove_that_moral_behavior_is_a_product_of_evolution/).
1.4.2. Con: Atheistic morality is a religion.
1.4.2.1. Con: Religion is [defined as](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religion) 'the service and worship of God or the supernatural'; atheistic morality is the inverse.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: Religion is [also defined](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/religion) as "a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith" Atheistic morality fits this definition.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Religion is based on faith and belief. In atheistic morality, there is a fundamental belief in the role of science; at its heart, atheistic morality is a faith-based pseudo-religion.
1.4.2.3. Con: Atheistic morality is a misnomer...  Secular ethics is what should be used.
1.4.3. Con: Formally hardly a pro for an original claim, as philosophy does not predate religion.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Some modern primitive [tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3) that have some form of religion in form of animism, but apparently lack any kind of philosophical doctrine and similar practices date back to the [Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_religion) era.
1.5. Con: God determined morality, otherwise mere self interest would drive human behavior.
1.5.1. Con: Self interest and the interest in the general wellbeing of others, which can arise through self-awareness alone, and does not require religion.
1.5.2. Con: If this statement was true, then ALL non religious people would be driven only by self interest. It's just not true.
1.5.2.1. Con: Not necessarily, there is the argument by clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson, for example, that narrative archetypes from religion are deeply rooted in our subconsciousness, so whether we believe in a God or not, we still follow those same fundamental principles that a God deemed on us from Theistic Evolution.
1.5.3. Con: A God should be proven first for us to be able to assert that it determines morality.
1.5.4. Con: This is false. If it were true, this would mean that religious people are always moral, which in fact, is not. The holy books, which claimed to be written by or inspired by "a God" contains numerous accounts of that God committing horrible and immoral atrocities, and exhibiting very man-like personality disorders \(narcissism, egotism, and self-centredness\).
1.5.5. Con: Self interest is compatible with morality. It is in an individual's self interest that system are fair and equitable, even if they don't always favor the individual above all else because on average they will create positive outcomes for the individual.
1.5.6. Con: Even under the assumption, that a deity determined morality, it's still conceivable, that morality precedes religion. The truthfulness of religious claims is irrelevant to the question.
1.6. Pro: Morality surely stems from our innate [sociality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociality). Religion came along when we started inventing stories in an attempt to explain what we did not comprehend.
1.6.1. Pro: As most religions are founded on morality, it makes sense that before religion was established, people acted by their own morals first.
1.7. Pro: An innate predisposition towards caring for others and equality exists in human nature.
1.7.1. Con: There can also be an innate predisposition towards evil and antisocial behaviour; morality is harder to judge in such cases.
1.7.2. Pro: Religious people are not less inclined to do immoral acts.
1.7.3. Con: It is not scientifically clear that such an innate predisposition exists as all human beings have been formed by a predominately religious culture.
1.7.4. Pro: [Neurophilosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophilosophy) a fascinating new field of research is, so far, in support of a [biological origin for morality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcXKBf48Tf4).
1.7.5. Pro: This predisposition toward caring has been [observed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_learning_in_animals) in a wide variety of animals. Neurophilosophy and [neurosciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) in general tend to show that morality as we know it, might be a survival tool given by evolution processes. The better a species get as using this tool, the better it will perform in an evolutionary context.
1.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.9. Con: While it is often accepted that humans have their own innate capacity to determine right/wrong, this morality must have a deeper basis. Morality only truly makes sense in a theist setting. Without a creator, the universe is a result of random chance, and therefore all actions are simply down to chaos, and nothing is right or wrong.
1.9.1. Pro: Those who died during 9/11 share the same fate as the terrorists who died, or anyone else who dies. Crying out against suffering and immorality would be pointless.
1.9.2. Con: That "morality must have a deeper basis" is a baseless assertion.
1.9.3. Con: That "morality only truly makes sense in a theist setting" is also a baseless assertion.
1.9.4. Con: "Without a creator, the universe is a result of random chance" is a false dichotomy.
1.9.5. Con: "And therefore \[...\] nothing is right or wrong" is a non sequitur; the universe's existence being random does not suggest no morality exists.
1.10. Pro: The [Euthyphro dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma) proves that an almighty, intervening, good God could not have determined morality on his own.  He either used preexisting criteria, or decided it randomly, both of which are against theism.
1.10.1. Pro: God cannot claim to be 'all-good' without 'goodness' being defined pre-God.
1.10.2. Con: If it is assumed that the Divine is above all other things, then the Divine is not subject to logic itself.
1.10.2.1. Pro: If the Divine is not subject to \(or out of the realm of\) logic, then it is absurd.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: Okay then, maybe the Divine is absurd
1.11. Pro: From a Judeo-Christian perspective, morality does indeed precede religion, just as God preceded creation. From this perspective, God—the origin of flawless morality and the antithesis of immorality—allows us a means within which 'He' might be known...the codification of a shared understanding, and common practices known as religion.
1.11.1. Pro: If people adhering to a certain religion are able to pick from their religious texts the parts that "make sense" \(such as being nice to your neighbor\), and cast out the passages that are "outdated" or "should not be understood literally" \(such as killing the infidels\), it means their understanding of right and wrong precedes religion.
1.12. Con: Atheist regimes have proven that the removal of religion from human nature creates widespread death and catastrophe, as in the case of Stalin or Mao.
1.12.1. Con: It is questionable to blame a removal of religion for the carnage wrought by Stalin and Mao; the more likely culprit is communism itself.
1.12.1.1. Pro: History has shown that any dogma, whether religious or political, is enough to cause widespread death and destruction.
1.12.1.1.1. Pro: The [inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition) is a good example of religious dogma causing death and destruction..
1.12.1.1.2. Pro: [Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism) & [nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism)  are good examples of dangerous political dogma causing death and destruction.
1.12.2. Con: The "[Atheist regimes](https://infidels.org/kiosk/article/the-fallacy-of-the-20th-century-atheist-regimes-898.html)" argument is demonstrably fallacious.
1.12.3. Con: Correlation does not prove causation.
1.12.4. Con: [Religious wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion) perpetrated by religious regimes are very common throughout history.
1.13. Con: Religion has been the cultural mechanism that teaches morality to the young. Given time they might learn the same lessons through life experience \(if they survive\), but why should society suffer when teaching religion short circuits the chaos. Religion indoctrinates the wisdom of moral behavior to the young in a way they can consume.
