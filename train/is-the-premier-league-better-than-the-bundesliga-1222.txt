Discussion Title: Is the Premier League Better than the Bundesliga?

1. The Premier League \(PL\) is better than the Bundesliga \(BL\).
1.1. Pro: The PL is more capable at attracting world-class players than the BL.
1.1.1. Pro: The [PL](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/startseite/wettbewerb/GB1)'s players have a total market worth of 4.4 billion €, while the [BL](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/marktwerte/wettbewerb/L1)'s players total only 2.4 billion €
1.1.1.1. Pro: Of the world's [100 highest-valued players](http://www.transfermarkt.de/spieler-statistik/wertvollstespieler/marktwertetop), 34 play in the PL and only 14 in the BL.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Of the world's [20 most valuable soccer clubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_most_valuable_football_clubs), eight are from the PL - and only three from the BL.
1.1.1.3. Con: Due to more money available, the PL tends to [drastically overvalue](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/west-ham/11337882/Andy-Carroll-has-cost-West-Ham-over-45-million.html) players, which leads to absurd situations like [Andy Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Carroll) being one of the most valuable players looking at what was paid for him.
1.1.2. Con: The PL seems to be less attractive than the BL for the next generation of up and coming super talents.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Renato Sanches was [targeted](http://www.goal.com/de/news/968/transfernews/2016/05/05/23152042/medien-manchester-united-kurz-vor-sanches-verpflichtung) by Manchester United, instead he went to Bayern.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Ousmane Dembele went to Borussia Dortmund, denying the interest of  [Leicester](http://www.goal.com/de/news/968/transfernews/2016/05/11/23374182/youngster-ousmane-dembele-ich-wei%C3%9F-wohin-ich-gehe) and [Liverpool](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/514942/Borussia-Dortmund-transfer-news-Liverpool-Ousmane-Dembele).
1.1.3. Pro: As of summer 2014, the average annual wage at PL clubs was about 1.5x as high as at BL clubs \([3.4 vs. 2.1 Mio Euro](http://www.globalsportssalaries.com/GSSS%202015.pdf)\).
1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.4. Pro: The PL is spending more on acquiring highly-valued players.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Over the course of the last ten seasons, the PL's clubs [spent](http://www.transfermarkt.de/transfers/transfersalden/statistik/plus/0?sa=&saison_id=2006&saison_id_bis=2015&land_id=&nat=&pos=&w_s=) more than three times as much on the acquisition of new players than the BL's clubs. At the same time, they made more than twice as much from selling players.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Of the 25 European clubs that [spent the most](http://www.transfermarkt.de/transfers/einnahmenausgaben/statistik/a/ids/a/sa//saison_id/2006/saison_id_bis/2015/land_id/0/nat/0/pos//w_s//plus/1) on new players during the last ten seasons, nine are from the PL and only two from the BL.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Of the [50 most expensive transfers ever](http://www.transfermarkt.de/transfers/wertvollstetransfers/statistik?saison_id=alle&land_id=0&ausrichtung=&spielerposition_id=&altersklasse=&leihe=&w_s=&plus=1), 22 had a PL club as their destination, whereas only five went to BL clubs. Looking at only the 25 most expensive transfers, these numbers change to 11 vs. 0.
1.1.5. Pro: Over the course of the past ten years, players from PL clubs were awarded a spot at the [FIFA Ballon d'Or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Ballon_d%27Or) awards \(or, until 2010, the [FIFA World Player of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Player_of_the_Year) awards\) four times, whereas players from BL clubs achieved this only twice.
1.2. Pro: The PL is more entertaining from a competitive standpoint.
1.2.1. Con: If the latest season is excluded, the past decade saw only five teams making it into the PL's top-3, whereas nine teams did so in the BL. Including the extraordinary last season, these numbers change to seven vs. nine.
1.2.2. Pro: The title is more contested in the PL than in the BL. During the past ten seasons, the champion was on average 5.3 points ahead of the second-ranked team in the PL, but 9.8 points ahead in the BL.
1.2.3. Pro: Of the BL's [25 most-valuable players](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/marktwerte/wettbewerb/L1), 18 play for either Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund. In the PL, the players of no single team occupy more than seven spots on [this list](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/startseite/wettbewerb/GB1).
1.2.4. Pro: Market value is distributed far more unequally in the BL. The share of all BL players' market value owned by the league's top two clubs is roughly equal to the share of all PL players' market value owned by the league's top four clubs \([37%](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/marktwerteverein/wettbewerb/L1) vs. [41%](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/marktwerteverein/wettbewerb/GB1)\).
1.2.5. Pro: Spending is distributed more equally in the PL than in the BL.
1.2.5.1. Con: Going by the average annual salaries of all teams as of 2014, the distribution of spending is similar in PL and BL. In both leagues, [about 30%](http://www.globalsportssalaries.com/GSSS%202015.pdf) of clubs pay above-average salaries.
1.2.5.2. Con: As of summer 2014, in [both PL and BL](http://www.globalsportssalaries.com/GSSS%202015.pdf) the top-3 three clubs accounted for about one third of the league's total spending on wages, and the top-5 clubs for about half of the league's total spending on wages \(adjusted for squad size\).
1.2.5.3. Pro: As of 2014, Bayern Munich alone accounted for about [20%](http://www.globalsportssalaries.com/GSSS%202015.pdf) of wage spending and [24%](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/startseite/wettbewerb/L1/plus/?saison_id=2014) of transfer spending in the BL. In the PL, the most profligate club \(Chelsea\) accounts for only [10%](http://www.globalsportssalaries.com/GSSS%202015.pdf) of wage spending and [13%](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/startseite/wettbewerb/GB1/plus/?saison_id=2014) of transfer spending.
1.2.6. Con: While the title race might be more competitive in the PL, the race for CL and EL places is usually uninteresting, because the "Big Five" who compete for the title also built the runner-ups which are the European Places.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United/City are usually the dominant clubs and the ones always playing on an international level.
1.2.6.2. Pro: During the last ten seasons, eight different BL clubs made it either directly into the CL or into the CL qualification, whereas only seven PL clubs did so.
1.2.7. Con: During the last ten years, four different teams have won the PL, which is the same number as in the BL.
1.2.8. Pro: In the last 5 years the PL has seen 4 different champions \(Manchester United, Manchester City, Leicester and Chelsea\), where as the BL has seen one \(Bayern Munich\).
1.3. Con: The PL utilizes domestic talent to a lower degree than the BL.
1.3.1. Pro: As of [last season](http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/163550/umfrage/auslaenderanteil-der-top-fussball-ligen/), 68% of all PL players were foreigners, whereas only 48% of BL players were.
1.3.1.1. Pro: During the last three seasons, only [43%](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/transfers/wettbewerb/GB1/plus/?saison_id=2013&s_w=&leihe=0&intern=0) of all players bought by PL clubs came from other English clubs, whereas [53%](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/transfers/wettbewerb/L1/plus/?saison_id=2013&s_w=&leihe=0&intern=0) of all players bought by BL clubs came from other German clubs.
1.3.2. Pro: Of the PL's 50 most valuable players, only [10](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/marktwerte/wettbewerb/GB1) are of British nationality. In the BL, [27](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/marktwerte/wettbewerb/L1) of them are of German nationality.
1.3.3. Pro: The BL's clubs are superior at nurturing home-grown talent.
1.3.3.1. Pro: PL clubs have on average a significantly lower number of 'homegrown' players than BL clubs \([3.4](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/eigengewaechse/wettbewerb/GB1/plus/1) vs. [6.1](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/eigengewaechse/wettbewerb/L1/plus/1)\).
1.3.3.2. Pro: The soccer academies of the BL's clubs are commonly seen as superior to and [more successful](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/premier-league-clubs-continue-to-lag-behind-rivals-in-nurturing-homegrown-talent-9823664.html) than those of PL clubs.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: The German youth coaching with mandatory academies for each Top 2 division club and a cohesive recruitment strategy started after the shocks of the EURO 2000 and 2004 and took some time to develop and produce footballers of international format. PL Clubs [just recently started](http://www.sport1.de/fussball/bundesliga/2015/09/karl-heinz-rummenigge-vom-fc-bayern-muenchen-warnt-vor-england) to do so on their own, thus it will take some time.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: This discussion is about the status quo the a present-day comparison of the two leagues, not about a potential future.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Germany won the U21 World Cup in 2009, including players like Boateng, Neuer and Özil, today's starting member of the general national squad.
1.3.3.3. Con: The average share of home-grown players in PL and BL squads is comparable at [11.7% and 13.3%](http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/mr/mr09/en/).
1.3.3.4. Pro: Home-grown talent gets more chances and plays a bigger role in the BL than in the PL. In the BL's clubs, the average play time of home-grown players is [almost equal](http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/mr/mr09/en/) to that of other players, whereas in the PL's clubs it as a third lower than that of other players.
1.3.3.5. Pro: During the past seven seasons, the average number of new players without previous experience in professional leagues launched per club per season in the BL was almost twice as high as in the PL \([0.75 vs. 0.43](http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/atlas/en/debutant-players.html)\).
1.3.3.6. Pro: The average BL club has home-grown talent with a market worth of [25.6 Mio. Euro](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/eigengewaechse/wettbewerb/L1/plus/1), whereas the average PL has home-grown talent with a market worth of merely [16.6 Mio Euro](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/eigengewaechse/wettbewerb/GB1/plus/1).
1.4. Pro: The PL has a higher [revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League#Finances) than the BL or any other league in the world. So, from an economical perspective, it is the most successful.
1.4.1. Pro: The PL has a TV-Deal, that brings the teams [8.3 Billion](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/12141415/Premier-League-clubs-to-share-8.3-billion-TV-windfall.html) Pounds, while the BL currently stands at [850 Million](http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/639808/artikel_850-millionen-euro_so-werden-die-tv-gelder-verteilt.html) Euro.
1.4.1.1. Pro: The PL can rely on competing Pay-TV stations in the UK with not so much Free-TV football, while the BL suffers from the fact that game recaps are being shown in the Sportschau \(Free-TV\) shortly after the games on the main matchday have ended and general lack of interest in Pay-TV in Germany. Thus there seems a general interest of "public availability" in Germany, while the big money in the PL is made with Pay-TV.
1.4.1.2. Con: PL clubs are highly reliant on their broadcasting deal. While it provides BL clubs with [28%](http://s.bundesliga.de/assets/doc/1070000/1066709_original.pdf) of their revenue, this number stands at [over 50%](http://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/sports-business-group/articles/annual-review-of-football-finance.html) in the PL, and at some clubs at [up to 80%](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/29/premier-league-finances-club-by-club).
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Best practice has it that businesses with reliance on a single source of income are more vulnerable to shake-ups.
1.4.2. Pro: The high profits made in the PL also have an impact on the lower Championship, with guaranteeing promoted teams [215 Million Euro](http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/intligen/startseite/651327/artikel_das-215-millionen-euro-spiel.html), even if they get immediately relegated.
1.4.3. Pro: The PL has two teams more than the BL and no "Winterpause", thus providing a nonstop flow of football throughout the whole season, with only a summer break.
1.4.3.1. Pro: ["Boxing Day"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_Day#Sport) is a very popular day to watch football, since a lot of derbies are played on that day, which makes it an attractive asset for TV-rights, while Germany is missing anything close to that.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The PL has 20 instead of 18 teams, which makes it possible to offer 4 more matchdays in the PL compared to the BL.
1.4.4. Con: The BL has a higher operating profit than the PL \([de.statista.com](http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/3550/umfrage/finanzielle-eckdaten---1-fussball-bundesliga-und-premier-league/)\).
1.4.4.1. Pro: In the 2010/11 season the BL achieved an operating profit of 171 Million € while the PL only earned 75 Million € \([handelsblatt.com](http://www.handelsblatt.com/sport/fussball/bundesliga-seria-a-und-co-bundesliga-bleibt-aergster-verfolger-der-premier-league/6696162-2.html)\)
1.4.4.1.1. Con: This number is likely outdated due to the PL's new TV-deal.
1.4.5. Con: As of 2015, nine of the 20 clubs in the PL were [in debt](http://www.totalsportek.com/money/premier-league-financial-report-of-all-20-clubs/) with more than 100 Million Pounds.
1.4.5.1. Con: As of last season, [more than two-thirds](http://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/sports-business-group/articles/annual-review-of-football-finance.html) of PL's debt was non-interest bearing.
1.4.5.2. Con: The debts of many of the Clubs, for example [Manchester United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glazer_ownership_of_Manchester_United#Refinancing), are very often the results of takeovers by investors. The debts are backed by real estate and other assests of the clubs and have no impact on the financial power of the clubs, as they have as much money to work with as the investors grant them.
1.4.6. Pro: The lack of investor unfriendly rules like 50+1 makes the PL more attractive to investors, which leads to more money coming into the league.
1.5. Con: The BL is more fan-friendly, attracts a bigger live audience and has a better stadium atmosphere.
1.5.1. Pro: During the 2015/16 season, [41%](http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/zuschauer-geschichte.html) of BL matches were sold out whereas only [11%](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/premier-league/besucherzahlen/wettbewerb/GB1/saison_id/2015/plus/1) of PL matches sold out.
1.5.1.1. Con: For all practical purposes this difference is not noticeable. The PL still has a stadium capacity utilization of [95.9%](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/premier-league/besucherzahlen/wettbewerb/GB1/saison_id/2015/plus/1), which is higher than that of the BL.
1.5.2. Con: The PL has more stadiums that are famous for their atmosphere than the BL.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The Atmosphere in Old Trafford, also known as the "Theatre of Dreams" is legendary.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: The stadium has made a [list](http://www.thesportster.com/soccer/top-15-soccer-stadiums-with-terrible-atmospheres/) of the world's stadiums with the worst atmosphere, a claim heard about many of the ordinary matches taking place there.
1.5.2.2. Pro: The Stadium Atmosphere of Liverpool is legendary and in the last weeks became an [important part](http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fc-legend-rush-amazing-11295840) of the club's international success.
1.5.2.3. Con: The Westfalenstadion \(Signal-Iduna-Park\) in Dortmund has a famous atmosphere.
1.5.2.4. Con: The Arena AufSchalke \(Veltins-Arena\) in Gelsenkirchen has a famous atmosphere.
1.5.3. Pro: BL tickets are way cheaper than PL tickets.
1.5.3.1. Con: The PL has this year [introduced](http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2015-16/mar/090316-premier-league-clubs-announce-new-deal-for-away-fans.html) a league-wide price limit for away-tickets at 30 Pounds.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: This is still more expensive than the average price in the BL.
1.5.3.2. Pro: The average price for 2015/16's cheapest season pass in the PL \([652€](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/ticket-prices-how-much-does-it-cost-to-watch-your-team-a6694486.html)\) is more than 3.5x the price of the average price for the BL's cheapest season pass \([181€](http://blog.uebersteiger.de/2015/06/25/preisuebersicht-dauerkarten-1-2-fussball-bundesliga-20152016/)\).
1.5.3.3. Pro: The [average ticket price](http://www.goeuro.co.uk/football-price-index) in the PL during the 2015/16 seasons stood at 68€, while it stood at only 29€ in the BL.
1.5.4. Pro: Various ultra groups add to the emotional atmosphere in German stadiums.
1.5.4.1. Con: Not every football fan appreciates the noisy, [at times aggressive](http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fankultur-und-ultras-das-verhalten-ist-teils-aggressiver-geworden-a-817312.html) atmosphere that ultra groups bring to football matches.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: 90 minutes of singing is enjoyed by many people.
1.5.4.1.2. Pro: Groups of ultras have repeatedly been linked to the presence of [hooliganism](http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/ultras-fans-im-fussball-und-die-probleme-mit-rassismus-a-970655.html) and the [usage of flares](http://www.focus.de/sport/fussball/bundesliga1/bundesliga-fischer-ultra-szene-hat-ein-pyro-problem_aid_1107049.html) in BL stadiums.
1.5.4.1.2.1. Con: Only a minority of ultras is violent.
1.5.4.2. Con: It is still a pretty [heated discussion](http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/gewalt-im-fussball-die-schattenseiten-der-fankultur.724.de.html?dram:article_id=316757) whether Ultras are a security problem in stadiums regarding violence or not.
1.5.4.3. Con: Ultras do not add something that was not there before, thus having no impact on the quality of the atmosphere.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: In the CL quarter- and semifinals against Manchester United and Real Madrid the air was literally shaking in the old "Olympiastadion".
1.5.4.3.2. Pro: At the famous 4 Minute Championship of Schalke there was a very emotional atmosphere \(in both directions\) without Ultra groups.
1.5.4.4. Con: Even Ultra groups cannot give a very emotional atmosphere to games between \(for example\) Wolfsburg against Hoffenheim or Leverkusen against Augsburg or Ingolstadt.
1.5.4.4.1. Con: That has nothing to do with investor driven clubs or "retort-clubs": The worst atmosphere in German professional football can be found in Munich at the German record-champion Bayern Munich.
1.5.4.4.2. Pro: Noone can give an emotional atmosphere to matches of these clubs.
1.5.4.4.2.1. Con: The Europe League appearances of Augsburg had actually pretty good atmosphere.
1.5.4.5. Pro: Their choreographies became an important part of every special match.
1.5.4.6. Pro: Their chants can thrill an entire stadium.
1.5.4.6.1. Con: There were chants in stadiums way before Ultra culture.
1.5.4.7. Pro: They support their clubs whenever and wherever.
1.5.4.7.1. Con: So do loyal fans who are not connected with ultra groups.
1.5.4.8. Pro: Ultra groups became an important factor in discussions about the quality of football clubs.
1.5.5. Pro: The absence of standing seats in PL stadiums has repeatedly been blamed for [crowd numbers](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10425094/Its-time-fans-were-allowed-to-stand-at-football-grounds.html) and an [atmosphere](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2512484/Special-report-Pressure-growing-allow-fans-stand-20-years-seater-stadiums-introduced.html) inferior to that in BL stadiums.
1.5.6. Con: Average beer prices per liter are identical in the two leagues: [8.09€](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2289482/Premier-League-clubs-Pie-pint-programme-costs-revealed.html) in the PL, [8.11€](http://www.stadionwelt.de/sw_stadien/index.php?head=Bier-amp-Wurst-in-deutschen-Stadien-BVB-am-guenstigsten&folder=sites&site=news_detail&news_id=12748) in the BL.
1.5.6.1. Con: While not more expensive than in the BL, beer in the PL [cannot](http://www.premierleague.com/content/premierleague/en-gb/fans/attending-a-match.html) be drunk on the seats but only in designated areas.
1.5.7. Pro: Fans are kept out of Premier League stadiums due to high ticket prices.
1.5.7.1. Pro: In both leagues Clubs are selling Tickets to tour organizers who resell the tickets combined with hotelbookings, thus local fans are kept out. \(See for example [here](http://www.dertour.de/dertour-live/fussball/) and [here](http://www.die-fussballreise.de/fussballreisen/premier-league-england/c-2201-index.html)\)
1.5.7.2. Con: During the 2015/16 season, the PL filled [95.9%](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/premier-league/besucherzahlen/wettbewerb/GB1/saison_id/2015/plus/1) of its stadium capacity, whereas the BL achieved only [92.8%](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/besucherzahlen/wettbewerb/L1/saison_id/2015/plus/1).
1.5.7.2.1. Con: This issue is not only about how many people buy tickets, but also about who is able to afford them. High prices might be acceptable for occasional visitors, tourists and those with deep pockets - but possible not for the loyal and local fans who help create stadium's atmosphere.
1.5.7.2.1.1. Con: A "change" in the visitors structure does not necessary relate to high ticket prices. In Munich the prices are decent in comparison, still you see many many not locals in the stadium leading to be famous for having one of the worst stadium atmospheres around Europe, although being sold out with a 70K+ stadium.
1.5.8. Pro: The Bundesliga is more inline with its roots and it genuinely cares for its fans where as the PL does not. Due to international interest and the amount of money clubs receive from oversea's the PL clubs do not value the people who created football in England for what it is. The fans.
1.5.9. Pro: BL stadiums are larger. During the 2015/16 season, the average size stood at [47.000 seats](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/besucherzahlen/wettbewerb/L1) whereas it stood at only [38.000](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/stadien/wettbewerb/GB1) in the PL.
1.5.9.1. Pro: During the 2015/16 season, the average attendance at BL matches stood at [42.860](http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/zuschauer-geschichte.html); in the PL it was merely [36.378](http://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/eng-premier-league-2015-2016/1/).
1.5.9.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.7.2.
1.5.10. Pro: Some English football fans even regularly [visit](http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/29624410) German stadiums as the atmosphere is better.
1.5.10.1. Pro: In English stadiums drinking alcohol \(on the seats\), smoking and even [standing](http://www.wembleystadium.com/TheStadium/StadiumGuide/RulesnRegulations) up for cheering is forbidden, which seams hard to bear for real football fans.
1.5.10.1.1. Con: The regulations mandating sitting during a match are on a regular basis [ignored](https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa90/2015/oct/09/safe-standing-bundesliga-fans-premier-league); guests who sit oftentimes [have problems](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2013-12-16b.590.0) even watching the match.
1.5.10.1.2. Pro: The Wembley Stadium's regulations [state that](http://www.wembleystadium.com/TheStadium/StadiumGuide/RulesnRegulations) "nobody may stand in any seating area whilst play is in progress".
1.5.10.1.3. Con: Even Nick Hornby in "Fever Pitch" [spoke out](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=v31gfptu4PwC&dq=fever+pitch&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y) in favor of an alcohol ban and seating-only stadiums for the PL.
1.5.10.1.4. Con: The reason there are pretty strict rules in English stadiums are because it was \(as described by Nick Hornby in "Fever Pitch"\) the genuine English fan culture that played a significant role in the tragedies of [Hillsborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster) and [Heysel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium_disaster).
1.5.10.1.4.1. Con: Hornby does not relate the catastrophe in Hillsborough to any genuine fan culture. He rather [criticizes](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=v31gfptu4PwC&dq=fever+pitch&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y) the fatuous perspective of many fans on the issue and calls out the systematic failure of authorities, club and stadium owners.
1.5.10.1.4.2. Con: Just recently a jury ruled that Hillsborough was the police's fault. [\(theguardian.com\)](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-inquests-jury-says-96-victims-were-unlawfully-killed)
1.5.11. Con: English football fans are known for having the best chants.
1.5.12. Pro: The fact that bored billionaires can buy English football teams and do whatever they like with them destroys the idea of football clubs and football culture.
1.5.12.1. Con: An Austrian billionaire bought the football team of Leipzig as well.
1.5.12.1.1. Con: The acquisition and development of RB Leipzig was a marketing move by Red Bull, not a random investment by a bored billionaire.
1.5.12.1.2. Con: Still there are more rules to follow for investors than in the PL.
1.5.12.1.2.1. Pro: For example the [50+1 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50%2B1_rule).
1.5.12.1.2.1.1. Pro: The 50 + 1 Rule allows the members of the clubs to still maintain control of the majority of the clubs stakes and via their procedures and structures to shape the clubs direction.
1.5.12.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: With the 50+1 rule the members maintain responsible for the actions their elected board members took and therefore ultimately for the future of the club.
1.5.12.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: At the VfB Stuttgart the relegation is ultimately the members' responsibility, because for years they elected people with no clue about football \(businessmen and politicians\) and their poor decisions drove the club that far.
1.5.12.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: FC Schalke 04 is constantly underachieving because the board, which gets elected over and over again has no clue about football and constantly interferes in the work of the sport executives and/or made poor personal choices because of the cluelessness.
1.5.12.1.2.1.2. Con: The 50+1 rule is very controversial and there are strong traits, that [the rule is illegal](http://www.tz.de/sport/1860-muenchen/interview-rechtsexperte-mark-orth-501-regel-2693118.html) and would get forbidden by the EU if somebody would sue against it.
1.5.12.1.2.1.2.1. Con: So far not a single investor in Germany sued against the rule, thus even they do not seem to believe it is illegal.
1.5.12.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: A trial at the EU would take a\) much time and cost b\) much money. Instead of going through this for a fair amount of time investors just invest their money in other clubs in other countries.
1.5.12.1.2.1.3. Con: Although it is possible to become a member of Rasenballsport Leipzig, the membership fee is prohibitively expensive, and the club reserve the right to reject any application without a reason. As a result the 50+1 rule can be circumvented as the club has only a handful of members, most of whom are Red Bull employees. [\(wikipedia.org\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50%2B1_rule)
1.5.12.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Due to its structure and purpose \(see comment\) RB Leipzig is the only club having the need for such a procedure and are as well the only club that handles this situation that way.
1.5.12.1.2.1.4. Con: 50+1 has a [time limit](http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/617728/artikel_hopp-darf-mehrheitseigner-bei-hoffenheim-sein.html), which makes it possible to bypass it if one has enough time.
1.5.12.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Someone who just wants to make money fast and does not care about football will not be willing to wait 20 years.
1.5.12.1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Fast money for investors is hardly being made with football teams, even pretty clear takeovers for profit like the Glazer's takeover of Manchester United are long term commitments.
1.5.12.1.2.1.5. Con: As seen at 1860 Munich, 50+1 can lead to difficult situations: An investor can have for example the majority of total stakes \(60%\) but only 49% of the stakes qualified for vote on decisions, while the organs of the business are casted 50-50 and thus the decisions making leads by structure to negative outputs on and off the pitch.
1.5.12.1.3. Pro: RB Leipzig is critizised for being merely a marketing tool by experts and fans alike.
1.5.12.2. Con: The idea of football clubs is to be successful, reach and stay in the highest league and win titles. All this requires huge investments.
1.5.12.2.1. Pro: Regarded matter of factly football clubs are companies offering goods \(e.g. fan products\) and services \(entertainment\). In order to be successful and to stay in the market \(leagues\) they have to invest huge amounts of money in the right personell and marketing.
1.5.12.2.2. Pro: As football clubs need huge investments to survive in a competitive environment, wealthy investors like billionaires are beneficial for the clubs.
1.5.12.2.3. Con: Leicester showed that there does not need to be a connection between money and success.
1.5.12.2.3.1. Con: Leicester spent around [50 million](http://www.transfermarkt.de/leicester-city/transfers/verein/1003/saison_id/2015) Euros for new players, that would be the [fourth most](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/transfers/wettbewerb/L1) in the BL behind Bayern, Dortmund and Leverkusen.
1.5.12.2.3.1.1. Con: This is still only a modest sum in the larger context of the club's league - which is, after all, the PL.
1.5.12.2.3.1.1.1. Con: When looking at the [transfer balance](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/transfers/wettbewerb/GB1/plus/?saison_id=2015&s_w=&leihe=0&intern=0) of the PL clubs, Leicester came with the 8th highest transfer deficit of all teams this season.
1.5.12.2.4. Con: That is not the only idea of a football club. If you are a member of a German football club you can influence important decisions, enjoy sports activities \(other than visiting a football stadium\) and help shape and inspire your club. In England these structures are gone now, but of course they were there before the big money invaded football.
1.5.12.2.4.1. Con: "Clubculture" and the things committed to it are not a thing exclusive to football clubs. High-tier Clubs, regardless if investor driven or not \(and be it in Germany or England\) are professional corporations, which demand a different structure by law and a different culture, because of the competitiveness of the surrounding they work in.
1.5.12.2.4.2. Con: Most football clubs in Germany are not solely football clubs, but rather sports clubs. The decision making, other activities and also shapening of the club is still possible, there is just no admission for the members to the \(often separated from the club in a GmbH/LLC or AG/stock corp.\) professional football section of it.
1.5.13. Con: The PL has a much higher number of derbies, throughout the country, even though the focus relies on London.
1.6. Con: The Premier League is awash with money and this dilutes the raw enjoyability of the football
1.6.1. Con: The fact it’s awash with money means that higher caliber players are attracted to the PL.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Dortmund’s Sokratis switched this year to Arsenal
1.7. Con: The BL's clubs are more successful in international competitions than the PL's clubs.
1.7.1. Con: Of the top-25 clubs in the UEFA's ranking over the past five years, the PL supplied one more than the BL \([5 vs. 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_coefficient#Country_coefficient)\).
1.7.2. Pro: The highest ranked BL  team has a higher UEFA ranking than the highest ranked  PL team \(FC Bayern - 154.883 vs. Chelsea - 142.078\)
1.7.3. Pro: The German and English football associations have almost identical [UEFA rankings](http://de.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/index.html) \(76000 vs. 80000\)
1.7.4. Con: During the last decade, a PL club made it into the [Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League)'s final match seven times, whereas a BL club only made it four times. Taking the semi-finals into account, this ratio stands at 14 for the PL vs. 8 for the BL.
1.7.5. Con: The PL has slightly more clubs \(13\) in the top-100 of the [UEFA's ranking](http://de.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/index.html) than the BL \(11\). If anything, the PL's clubs have therefore been more successful in recent years.
1.7.6. Con: Looking at the Titles in the current highest two European competitions, Champions League \(CL\) and Europa League \(EL\), the PL has won 4 times the CL \(while the BL has 3\) and 1 time the EL \(Germany zero times\). Thus the PL has more success as of the current competitions.
1.8. Con: The football played in the BL is more attractive than that in the PL.
1.8.1. Con: British referees are internationally known for allowing a certain level of "robust" plays and do not whistle at every contact, as for example very often happens in the BL. That helps to establish and to keep a game-flow instead of destroying it with small intermissions.
1.8.1.1. Pro: The average match in the BL during the last ten seasons was interrupted by [3.5](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/fairnesstabelle/wettbewerb/L1/plus/?saison_id=2006) yellow cards, whereas the average PL match was interrupted by only [3.1](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/fairnesstabelle/wettbewerb/GB1/plus/?saison_id=2006).
1.8.2. Con: Although maybe being tactically less advanced than the BL, the action on the pitch in the PL is faster and higher, because of the traditional "kick and rush" tradition in England.
1.8.3. Con: Matches in the PL are more exciting. The share of goals scored during the last 15 minutes \(incl. overtime\) of all matches during the last ten seasons was slightly higher than in the BL \([22.85%](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/torverteilungminuten/wettbewerb/GB1) vs. [21.34%](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/torverteilungminuten/wettbewerb/L1)\).
1.8.4. Con: The PL is placed higher than the BL in the ranking of the most exciting football leagues in the world. [totalsportek.com](http://www.totalsportek.com/football/ranking-best-league-in-the-world/)
1.8.5. Con: The PL is much more competitive than the BL: there are always 5-6 teams that are able to become champion. If you look at the BL, in last 16 years you can see the dominant position either of FC Bayern\(11 championships\) or Borussia Dortmund \(3 championships\). [PL champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_football_champions) [BL champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_football_champions)
1.8.6. Pro: The last huge tactical developments in terms of football were developed in Germany - they were so good, the PL decided to sign both coaches responsible for them.
1.8.6.1. Pro: Although being pretty one dimensional the "Run and gun" style of Jürgen Klopp at Dortmund \("Pressingmaschine"\) took the BL by surprise and accounted for back to back Championships and a CL Finale. Now he is working at Liverpool trying to implement that style at Merseyside.
1.8.6.2. Pro: Pep Guardiola took "Tiki-Taka" to the next Level, adjusting it with polyvalent players and position interpretations and added new elements usually not seen at the classic possesion football.
1.8.6.2.1. Pro: "Packing" \(meaning the number of players "overplayed" by long passes\) became an own category in the analysis of the game - maybe best shown with Jerome Boateng and his ability to play long balls over dozens of meters, something that was hardly to not to be seen by CB's.
1.8.6.2.2. Pro: The Wing Backs act "inverted" thus not only going up and down the sideline but moving more into the centre of the pitch allowing for powerplay situations on offense as well as on defense.
1.8.6.2.3. Con: That kind of football is only possible when you have the right players to do so and those calibres are only affordable for a very very few clubs in the world generally.
1.8.6.2.4. Pro: Although being famous for implementing the "false 9" at Barcelona, Guardiola adapted the role of the Striker \(R. Lewandowski and T. Müller\) to very complete roles with much more duties on the defensive end and with much more work on the sidelines. The result was for both strikers the best individual season in their career.
1.8.7. Pro: During the past ten seasons, the average number of goals per match was always higher in the BL \([2.87](http://www.weltfussball.de/statistik/bundesliga/1/) over all seasons\) than in the PL \([2.65](http://www.worldfootball.net/stats/eng-premier-league/1/) over all seasons\).
1.8.8. Pro: There are very few teams in the PL that follow a distinct tactical approach, which get the time to get implemented and develop. 3 of those teams top this years PL table \(Leicester, Arsenal, Tottenham\) and they either stuck with the coach during the last years \(Tottenham, Arsenal\) or changed the coach due to non sportive reasons but the approach towards the game was the same \(Leicester\).
1.8.8.1. Pro: Arsenal under Arsene Wenger follows a clear approach of a dynamic offensive game with a free flowing passing game, being able to adapt to the opponent and either "make the game" or focus on counter.
1.8.8.2. Pro: Leicester focused on a defense first approach and relied heavily on counter attack football, without going blind down the pitch but following trained moves.
1.8.8.3. Pro: Tottenham makes perfect use of their star striker Harry Kane, building the offense around him, while having a solid defense who keeps the game in balance and starts counter attacks.
1.9. Con: More than half of all PL clubs have majority owners born outside the UK. In the eyes of many, this makes them investment targets first - and sport clubs with a responsibility to tradition and local origin second.
1.9.1. Con: The average PL player has been longer with his current club than the average BL player \([938](http://www.transfermarkt.de/premier-league/vereinstreue/wettbewerb/GB1) vs. [868](http://www.transfermarkt.de/1-bundesliga/vereinstreue/wettbewerb/L1) days\).
1.9.2. Con: Football is about winning, investment is about winning. In both cases winning comes with loads of money, thus a "marriage" of those seems pretty natural as both are highly competitive fields with lots of money to be made.
1.9.3. Pro: Although [changed back](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2903337/Cardiff-City-set-announce-club-colour-return-blue-red-Vincent-Tan-finally-bows-fan-pressure.html) meanwhile, Cardiff City changed the club colors from blue to red and the club's badge from a bluebird to a dragon because the new investor wanted so. That was a unique process so far, showing how little investors initially care about a club's heritage and tradition.
1.9.4. Con: Leicester City F.C., those days often called the "anti-thesis" to typical PL clubs, is investor owned as well. But Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha favored an approach of building a team and letting it grow.
1.9.5. Con: The Investors of Chelsea London and Manchester City for example spent billions of Euros into their teams to win titles, not to make money.
1.9.6. Pro: Events in the PL are more profit-driven and thus fast-moving than in the BL.
1.9.7. Con: Most of football fans would not care about this while deciding about what of both leagues is better.
1.9.8. Pro: -> See 1.5.7.
1.9.9. Pro: Some fans even found their own clubs because they are so disgusted by their former favourite clubs' leadership.
1.9.9.1. Pro: [Portsmouth F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_F.C.), a "Traditionsklub" with a long PL history, was bought by a fan-organization after the previous owner ran it into administration. It is currently the largest club owned by supporters, currently plays in the League Two \(4th tier in England\) being the highest ranked fan-owned club in English professional football.
1.9.9.1.1. Con: With this past season being over, the [AFC Wimbledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Wimbledon) is now the highest ranked "fan owned" club in England, after winning Promotion into the League One \(3rd tier league\).
1.9.9.2. Pro: Most famous example is [FC United of Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.C._United_of_Manchester), founded by Manchester United supporters.
1.10. Pro: The PL is preferred by fans outside of Europe, for example in [China](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-3284650/Majority-Chinese-football-fans-support-UK-Premier-League-clubs-350-million-regularly-watching-games.html).
1.10.1. Pro: The PL's native language is English, which is much more widespread around the world than German. The BL still is far behind the PL in their foreign TV rights, only for the last couple years they started to promote it.
1.10.2. Pro: The PL has much higher revenue from selling international TV rights than the BL.
1.10.2.1. Pro: The PL's earnings for international TV rights for the 2016/2017 season are estimated at 1.4 Billion $ while the BL's earnings supposed to be around [170 Million $](http://www.forbes.com/sites/mattconnolly/2016/05/28/one-championship-breaks-ground-for-mma-in-thailand-with-historic-sellout-event/#6259b574480f)
1.10.2.2. Pro: The PL earned around 1 Billion € from international TV rights for the 2014/2015 season, while the BL earned only 80 Million $ for the same season \([forbes.com](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2015/02/15/an-apples-to-apples-comparison-of-tv-rights-fees-paid-to-big-european-soccer-leagues/2/#73d6b4b5334c)\)
1.10.2.3. Pro: During the 2011/2012 season the PL earned 530 Million € from broadcasting outside it's home country, while the BL only earned around 47 Million € \([11freunde.de](http://www.11freunde.de/artikel/wer-schaut-die-bundesliga-im-ausland)\)
