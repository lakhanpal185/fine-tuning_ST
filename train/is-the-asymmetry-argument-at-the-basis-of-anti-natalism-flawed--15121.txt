Discussion Title: Is the Asymmetry Argument at the basis of anti-natalism flawed ?

1. The asymmetry argument at the basis of anti-natalism is flawed
1.1. Con: most people would not bring their children into a life of certain suffering, even if future generations might be happy
1.2. Pro: In order to accept the Asymmetry argument, you first have to accept some sort of utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is false.
1.2.1. Pro: Life is inherently valuable. In some cases, death might be preferable to continued suffering, but a life of 51% pain and 49% pleasure does not seem unworthy of living.
1.2.2. Con: We could reject basic Utilitarianism but uphold some other version of Utilitarian like Rule-based Utilitarianism \(for example\)
1.2.2.1. Con: Claim here - unless refined, is that all Utilitarianism is false
1.2.2.2. Con: But any version of Utilitarianism that doesn't lead to the idea that a life is unworthy of living when suffering outweighs happiness, does not have any bearing on anti-natalism.
1.2.2.3. Con: Basic Utilitarianism \(or Act Utilitarianism\) and Rule Utilitarianism are not distinct, thus rejecting one entails rejecting the other.
1.2.3. Pro: Pain is not always bad. We often seek out pain to achieve a higher good \(stretching, dieting, getting vaccinated \).
1.2.3.1. Con: No Utilitarian claims that any small amount of pain is bad. The measure of 'good' is the overall ratio of pleasure to pain so a vaccination is seen as producing surplus pleasure/happiness despite the momentary pain.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: It's unclear, in different Utilitarian writings, over what time period the "pleasure/pain" measurement is done. "In the long run we're all dead"...
1.3. Pro: Contrary to the third statement of the Asymetry Argument, the non-existing pain of a non-existing thing is not a good thing, it's just nothing.
1.4. Pro: Contrary to the Asymmetry Argument, it IS theoretically possible to deprive a yet-unborn child of happiness [www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/8krrg3/after_listening_to_the_is_life_worth_living/dzc9egd/)
1.4.1. Pro: You can do something now to deprive a future person of happiness - it's no different to causing future pain! 
e.g. poison an anti-natal ward causing birth deformities in the future

1.4.2. Pro: Negative happiness = pain and -\(Pain\) = Happiness! There is no absolute zero - it's a spectrum and treating them as different things is non-sensical
1.4.2.1. Pro: Only the contrast to pain makes pleasure real.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: If we accept that the absence of pain is good, then with a consistent thinking, we should also accept that the absence of pleasure is bad.
1.4.2.2. Con: No happiness doesn't mean Negative happiness. Imagine a building where upstairs you feel happiness and downstairs you feel pain. If you aren't upstairs \(no happiness\), you are not necessarily underground \(pain\). You can also be at ground level, feeling neither happiness nor pain.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: This argument still places pleasure and pain on the same spectrum. It simply says that there is a mid point, a point of equilibrium, between the two.
1.5. Con: One cannot cause harm to a non-existent being
1.5.1. Con: This argument is a statement of the Non-Identity Problem.[francoistremblay.wordpress.com](https://francoistremblay.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/the-non-identity-problem/)
The argument against the NIP is that there is a causal link between the non-entity and the future-person. If one puts poison in a maternity ward \(empty at the time\) that causes birth defects in babies born a week later \> one assumes a harm was done \(at the time of planting the poison\)
1.5.2. Pro: Beings that do not exist do not have nervous systems and thus cannot feel pain.
1.6. Con: The absence of pain is good even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone.
1.6.1. Pro: One of the [definitions of "good"](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/good) is: "To be desired or approved of." As long as we approve to the absence of pain, then it is good.
1.7. Pro: Unless you're a hedonist, pleasure isn't necessarily good, just as pain isn't necessarily bad.
1.8. Con: The absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is somebody for whom that absence is a deprivation
1.9. Pro: It is logically incorrect to say that non-beings cannot be deprived of pleasure, but can be spared pain
1.9.1. Pro: Either a being can feel pleasure and pain, or it cannot experience either.
1.10. Pro: happiness can outweigh pain - even for future-beings
1.11. Con: All lives involve experiencing pain
1.11.1. Pro: Humans have many complex systems attuned to highlight painful sensations, so pain is impossible to completely avoid.
1.12. Con: Anti-natalists are not necessarily pro-mortalists
