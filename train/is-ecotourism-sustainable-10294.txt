Discussion Title: Is ecotourism sustainable?

1. Ecotourism is not sustainable.
1.1. Con: Ecotourism protects natural environments that may otherwise be destroyed.
1.1.1. Pro: The establishment of protected areas for ecotourism purposes can directly stop deforestation. This has been proven to work in Costa Rica, where the ecotourism industry is very strong. Ecotourism areas here protect the rain forest from being used for timber, farmland, development or other uses. [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479796900316)
1.1.2. Pro: Ecotourism provides value to a local area. Assessments of this value can protect natural environments. For instance, if a company can make a set amount from logging an area, but more money can be made over an extended period of time through ecotourism, it is more economically beneficial to protect that area and use it for ecotourism.

1.1.3. Con: Areas protected by ecotourism are small in comparison to total natural landmass, and environmental damage around ecotourism like emissions from flying offsets the amount of land saved from alternate uses.
1.1.4. Con: Human presence in these areas disrupts the natural environment. A literature review by The Nature Conservancy found that recreational activities like use of paths has negative impacts on the environment like noise pollution and erosion.

1.2. Con: Ecotourism can help promote the economic growth of a country.
1.2.1. Pro: An article titled "Ecotourism as a form of Sustainable Development in South Africa" makes the claim that ecotourism can act as a powerful tool for development, economically, socially, and environmentally. The influx of foreign cash to local areas supports local businesses and would boost the local economy. [Article here.](https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/docview/760946555/CFC464A8906C48CAPQ/13?accountid=14906)
1.2.2. Con: An economy can become too dependent on Ecotourism, which may cause neglect in other areas of economic development. [This article](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://duckduckgo.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1051&context=envstudtheses) discusses ecotourism in Costa Rica. Economically, Costa Rica relies heavily on ecotourism. Without tourism, the country would struggle. This means that although ecotourism can seem to bolster an economy, it is really only bolstering the ecotourism sector of an economy.
1.2.3. Pro: Ecotourism's focus on locally crafted goods helps create local jobs.
1.3. Con: Ecotourism gives people an opportunity to have a new experience with nature and learn more about environmental issues, fostering respect for the environment.
1.3.1. Con: Although, ecotourism gives people an opportunity to experience global nature first hand, the practice is fundamentally environmentally disruptive because of the carbon dioxide emissions from travel and disruption from associated infrastructure among other factors.
1.3.1.1. Con: The travel and infrastructure around ecotourism may produce ill effects for the environment, but they are outweighed by the benefits. For instance, one study found that the practices of tour operators and their guided tours helped local areas environmentally, economically, and socially.[Find the full article here](http://lifescienceglobal.com/pms/index.php/jrge/article/view/4744). Ecotourism positively effects local communities and gives areas a powerful incentive to respect the natural environment.
1.3.2. Pro: Increased awareness of ecosystems diversity and global environmental issues [will cause](https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-implementation-of-green-tourism-and-hospitality-2167-0269-1000233.php?aid=77953) ecotourists to be more environmentally conscious in their daily lives. It may encourage them to change their lifestyle and live in a more eco-friendly manner.
1.3.2.1. Pro: The increased awareness fostered by ecotourism will passively transfer to others in an individual's social circle through direct interaction \(conversation\) and observation. This could potentially cause a ripple effect where those effected begin to become more environmentally conscious. [Ripple Effect definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ripple%20effect)
1.3.2.2. Con: The lessons learned while traveling to an ecotourism destination are unlikely to be applied directly to everyday life. Also, individuals who practice ecotourism are likely to already be aware of environmental issues. This is an example of preaching to the choir.
1.4. Pro: Ecotourism, as with all tourism, leads to visitor overcapacity, which can damage local environments.
1.5. Pro: Ecotourism requires infrastructure to be built, which harms biodiversity.
1.5.1. Pro: Roads that are built for tourists to access remote locations disturb the environment.
1.5.1.1. Con: When roads are built, it causes less disturbance to plant and animal life as roads can help guide tourists rather than letting cars and visitors trample over them.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Roads can cause a decline in animal populations.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: This can result from either animals not being able to cross the road without being killed.
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: The total number of large mammal-vehicle collisions has been estimated at [one to two million](http://www.peopleswaywildlifecrossings.org/how-do-roads-impact-wildlife) in the United States and at 45,000 in Canada.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Roads that are built for tourists to get from one place to another are said to limit animal movement.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: If individual animals of a species have limited movement all of their range or in part , then divided populations can become genetically different from each other. This [jeopardizes survival](https://ncst.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/03-11-2016-NCST_Brief_ITSSchreier_FINAL.pdf) of populations and even the species as a whole.
1.6. Pro: Ecotourism alters animal behaviour and activity.
1.6.1. Pro: Intensive dolphin and whale watching by swimmers and boats can [cause disturbance](https://www.american.edu/sis/gep/upload/education-ecotourism_srp_ben_sander-2.pdf) for marine mammal acoustic activity and behaviour.
1.6.2. Pro: Animals that live on land, such as bears, are affected by human activity as the presence of tourists near their habitats is said to shorten their hunting and [sleeping patterns](https://www.american.edu/sis/gep/upload/education-ecotourism_srp_ben_sander-2.pdf).
1.6.3. Con: Ecotourism allows people to interact with animals more often, which enables scientists to research the effects of interaction with animals. Further research conducted may help with their conservation in the future and help to recover endangered species.
1.6.4. Pro: Negative effects [have been found](https://www.american.edu/sis/gep/upload/education-ecotourism_srp_ben_sander-2.pdf) in penguins who, when near the presence of humans, do not come to the shore to feed their hatchlings, lowering the survival rate of chicks as they do not receive the right amount of nutrition at a young age.
1.7. Pro: A consequence of ecotourism is that it can destroy fauna and flora.
1.7.1. Pro: Loss of natural habitats and many of the aforementioned types of pollution contributes to the disappearance of several animal and plant species that lived in those natural habitats in the past. Tourist behavior can [affect](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09669580508668581) both flora and fauna that thrive in ecotourist areas, as they may leave waste behind or even trample plant life without noticing.
1.7.2. Con: Ecotourism helps preserve the populations of threatened species.
1.7.2.1. Pro: [Research found](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160218114837.htm) that for seven out of nine animal species involved, ecotourism provides net conservation gains through factors such as removal of federal predators, reduction in habitat damage and anti-poaching policies.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.7.2.1.
1.8. Pro: People often have to fly to travel somewhere to be an ecotourist, which is highly polluting.
1.8.1. Pro: A round trip flight from New York City to San Francisco uses almost [1 metric tonne](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/climate/airplane-pollution-global-warming.html) of carbon per person.
1.9. Con: Ecotourism is a far better alternative than regular tourism. Disallowing all tourism isn't really a viable option for most locations.
