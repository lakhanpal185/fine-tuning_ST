Discussion Title: Children Voting: Should the Minimum Voting Age be Abolished?

1. Children should be allowed to vote.
1.1. Pro: Getting children to vote from a young age will make it more likely they will keep voting in the future, which will help to strengthen democracy.
1.1.1. Con: It is possible to let them practice voting without counting the results.
1.1.1.1. Con: Voting is often a cumbersome process. Teaching people to do it, and at the same time saying the act is pointless at this time is not likely to create a lasting habit.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Hypothetical 'practice voting' does not bear the responsibility of being an incentive. It is practice and practice only.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Whether or not something is practice versus training does not disappear the effect of incentives, or lack there of. If something is a miserable and pointless experience, saying that it's pointlessness is okay because it was just practice isn't going to stop the negative conditioning.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Gerrymandering and sweeping counts render many votes useless in adult "real" elections. Still, the practice of voting is encouraged. Perhaps not to tip the scales \(i.e., one blue vote in a red county\), but to own the issue enough to have a stand worth voting over.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The practice could still have rewards, without affecting the actual election. Extra credit for each ballot item you voted for that passed, for example.
1.1.2. Con: The strength of democracy lies in the content it offers, not in its form - it's better to have 30% of voters choosing a moral, and effective candidate, than 90% voters choosing a would be tyrant.
1.1.2.1. Con: It is not the ends that define, or give value to a democracy, but the means.
1.1.2.2. Con: Often it would be the opposite. 30% of voters choosing a "tyrant", whilst the silent majority sit by and let it happen.
1.1.3. Con: Allowing children to vote could also produce the opposite outcome and lead to political apathy as children might grow up with the observation that their political activity has no effect.
1.1.4. Con: Doing something as a child does not necessarily mean you will continue to do it as an adult. In fact sometimes things are the opposite.
1.1.5. Pro: They will get to know that to whom they can really trust cause you know how politics really is. They will get to know that what's right and what's wrong.
1.1.6. Con: This was never experienced before, therefore we don't know if children would still vote or not in the future
1.2. Pro: Voting is a right and should be denied to no citizen capable of understanding a ballot and communicating how they wish to fill it.
1.2.1. Con: There are many activities that children are restricted from participating in that they may claim a legal right to as adults. Those rights have not been denied, they have been postponed.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Children are prohibited from most forms of work.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Children are prohibited from most forms of work because many times when they have, and do work, they are at the complete mercy of their employer, relying on them for food, shelter, and access to services such as police, as such, they don't have the leverage needed to prevent civil rights abuses against them.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Children are prohibited from operating motor vehicles.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Children are prohibited from operating motor vehicles because of the substantial risk of loss of life improper operation is likely to cause, and the determined high probability of children operating them improperly, voting has no comparable risk, or cost.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Voting most often refers to both the establishing of laws and electing leaders. In either case, improper application can lead to substantial loss of life or liberty.
1.2.1.3. Con: All of these activities have the possibility of death, severe long term injury, or human rights abuses attached to them, voting has no such risks.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: Voting selects the candidates who will make/enact/enforce the laws that govern a nation. There is the very real possibility of causing death, long term injury or human rights abuses with every vote cast.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: A person lacking the vote has just as much influence over an election, and therefore is at least as dangerous as, a vote, especially in the common first past the pole systems, where a lack of a vote for one party is seen as a clear indicator for it's opponent.
1.2.1.4. Con: Democratic votes differ from actions of a single person. They do not have direct consequences; only together with all the other votes they make a difference.
1.2.2. Con: Voting is not a right that is given to each and every resident of a particular area. It is commonly restricted based on various criteria, for example nationality and criminal history.
1.2.2.1. Con: [It is not clear if felons should be denied the right to vote.â€‹](https://www.kialo.com/should-felons-lose-the-right-to-vote-1470/1470.0=1470.1/=1470.1)
1.2.3. Con: There are responsibilities that come with every right \(be it to the nation or to a fellow citizen\). They would be expected to handle those responsibilities just like everyone else.
1.2.4. Pro: Lack of political representation enables older generations to perform inter-generational theft \(e.g. housing bubbles, unfunded retirement programs, excessive national debt\).
1.2.4.1. Con: This is a two-way street. Schooling, child care payments and any type of child safety law increases cost/takes wealth away from individuals who generate it. Theft is taking away someone property, and children do not have property.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Children have a moral right to their fair share of the states wealth.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Children have the right to wealth they make for themselves, or that which there family may want to give to them, or the state provides to there parents for there well being as voted on by the people of that nation. There is no "moral" right to a "fair" share.
1.2.5. Pro: The cutoff age is always arbitrary. Fundamental rights must not be arbitrarily denied.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Someone at the age of puberty is not a child, and if not ready to be an adult, a fault of society and the parents. Nature or a God, if you will, made them adult on time, but it is our responsibility to make sure they know the consequences of there actions at puberty. We keep children from growing up mentally to keep them at home for our own selfish reasons, and denied the vote to them because they would demand a change, like the flower power of the sixty's.
1.2.6. Con: If a person cannot have legal independence then that person should not be allowed to vote. Presumably, minors and the mentally disabled have caretakers representing their interests. An argument could be made that emancipated minors should be allowed representation but in general, minors should not vote.
1.2.6.1. Con: Legal independence has an arbitrary age limit too.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: Legal independence and voting both have arbitrary age limits but the point is they should be the same. If we were to change one then we should change the other.
1.2.6.1.2. Con: Legal Independence has over time had it's age limit pushed up because we regarded it as immoral to have say [Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stinney) on death row.
1.2.6.1.2.1. Con: As [the death penalty should not be used on anyone](https://www.kialo.com/death-penalty-in-the-us-inhumane-or-just-801/801.0=801.1/=801.1), this isn't really a good reason to prevent them from having legal independence.
1.2.6.2. Con: Represented voting violates the democratic principle of one person one vote.
1.2.6.3. Pro: No mechanism exists to detect when the legal representative is voting against the wishes of the child.
1.2.7. Con: Voting is a privilege, not an inalienable right. Society can restrict voting to whoever it wants. Voting could be restricted to landed white males. That might be unconstitutional but it wouldn't be violating anybody's inalienable rights.
1.2.7.1. Pro: This is underlined by the existence of [felony disenfranchisement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement). Due to their crimes, convicted felons lose their 'privilege' to elect.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: [Felony disenfranchisement is also wrong.](https://www.kialo.com/should-felons-lose-the-right-to-vote-1470/1470.0=1470.1)
1.2.7.2. Con: If a person does not have the right to vote, they do not have the ability to defend any one of their rights. As such, it must be a right.
1.2.7.2.1. Con: While many governments establish voting as a legal right, it is not an [inalienable right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights) \(a universal right that is not dependent on the laws or customs of any particular culture or government\). Voting wouldn't exist at all without government so it can't be inalienable.
1.2.7.2.1.1. Con: If a person was not a member of another government, then they would still be in the state consisting of themselves, a government within which they would have the sole vote on all decisions, so even without a government, a person does have the right to vote.
1.2.7.2.1.2. Con: People have the right to defend themselves from all attacks on their person, including attacks on their rights. If the form this right must take is voting, then a person must have the right to vote.
1.2.7.2.1.2.1. Con: Attacking a person's rights is by definition an attack on their rights not an attack on their person.
1.2.7.2.2. Con: In a [constitutional state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law), citizens have the ability to sue the state \(government\) in case their constitutionally guaranteed rights are violated. Being able to vote is not essentially needed.
1.2.7.2.2.1. Con: If they have no say in the appointment of the judge, directly, or otherwise, it is not only possible, but likely that the judge hearing their case will not consider them as equal members when making ruling.
1.2.7.2.2.1.1. Con: In many constitutional democracies, eg in Germany, judges are not elected but appointed.
1.2.7.2.2.1.2. Con: Every citizen is equal in front of the law: Judges do not have the capabilities to introduce a second class of citizens, as they are bound to the respective constitutions.
1.2.7.2.2.2. Con: Without the ability to have a say in one's government, one can have this course of redress striped away arbitrary.
1.2.7.2.2.2.1. Con: A significant part of today's democracies' citizens do not have a say in government at all: they have not elected for the winning party or parties. Nonetheless, their rights remain.
1.2.7.2.2.2.2. Con: In modern democracies citizens do not have a say in government: they are merely able to elect representatives who hopefully act according to the voters' preferences. However, a direct say is not needed as the constitution protects their rights.
1.2.7.3. Con: If voting were restricted to only parts of society, then the definition of democracy would no longer apply.
1.2.8. Pro: Article 21 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) declares that "\(1\) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives."
1.2.8.1. Con: The [UDHR](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/what-universal-declaration-human-rights) is merely "an expression of the fundamental values which are shared by all members of the international community" and by no means a legally binding treaty.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.1.
1.2.8.1.2. Con: Everyone agrees that murder is bad. Some people might still murder people, some countries might decide not to have laws punishing murders, but neither of these change the fact that murder is bad. The same logic applies here.
1.2.8.2. Con: The [Universal declaration of human rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) omits many fundamental rights.
1.2.8.2.1. Con: An omission of some rights does not mean the rights guaranteed inside it are invalid.
1.2.9. Con: It would be difficult for a citizen's capability to vote to be tested accurately, if it was a test they completed when registering to vote then others could assist them with it, if it was a test carried out prior to every vote it would make the voting process longer and would require more labour to carry out, possibly discouraging people from voting.
1.2.9.1. Pro: In the deep south a l[iteracy test](http://www.crmvet.org/info/lithome.htm) was created that was too hard for local blacks to complete with the intention of discouraging voters as it was not uniformly applied.
1.3. Con: Families [tend to vote the same](http://news.gallup.com/poll/14515/teens-stay-true-parents-political-perspectives.aspx), especially when children are too young to decide for themselves; allowing children the right to vote unfairly favors households with more children.
1.3.1. Con: There aren't many issues that would affect people with children in a different way than those without, so this is unlikely to cause major political changes.
1.3.2. Con: A slight shift in the balance of power is not a sufficient reason to deny people rights.
1.3.3. Con: Families should have this added relative weight as they include more people.
1.3.3.1. Con: This is the same as claiming people with more money should have more weight. In both cases, both the risks and rewards are bigger. Also, with your claim, you implicitly support the idea of influencing children's votes.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: The grandparent claim does not say that families should have more weight because their is more risk, and reward, it explicitly says they should have more weight because they include more people. Being rich does not make you more people, or more of a person, so the logic can not be extended to the rich.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: Nothing in the grandparent claim suggests that one should try to influence another's vote. It merely points out that 3 people is more people then 1 person, and ask for those 3 people to have 3 times the voice of that one person.
1.3.3.2. Con: Democracies dictate one person one vote, no family unit should have power over any individual.
1.3.4. Pro: A child would never want to do something to disappoint its parents, especially at younger ages.
1.3.4.1. Con: Democracies tend to teach people to take pride in individuality, free expression, and independent thought, so children also have incentives to vote independent of what their parents want.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: It is the parents that teach the values that they respect most to their children, not the political system they are part of.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: Children from non democratic nations can just as often be seen parroting the talking points of there parents and of that of the system of government \(our system is best etc etc\).
1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Children living in a democracy don't live in systems of government other then a democracy, they live in a democracy, so the points they would parrot back would, by this argument, be democratic.
1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: Religion is also something that tends to get forced into children at a young age. They can not explain why they believe what they believe, just that it's taught to them.
1.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: There are quite a few adults who believe in their religion purely because they were told to, if that is grounds for children being disqualified from voting, it is equal grounds for striping adults of their voting rights.
1.3.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Biggest difference is they have chosen to believe. There comes a point where you must ether accept it all as truth/understand they are stories/disbelieve/walk away. They've made that choice regardless of the facts. Children haven't yet, they will accept it readily as truth or won't question it.
1.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Many people live in insulated prosecutory communities where they legitimately have not had the chance to question their believes.
1.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: Most children would not even encounter a state official separate from there parents until preschool/public school.
1.3.4.1.1.3.1. Con: Preschools usually start accepting students at about 2, or 2 1/2, which is just about the time they would probably be able to vote.
1.3.4.1.1.4. Con: Children are exposed to the outside world through media, social interactions, and education.
1.3.4.1.1.4.1. Con: Those interaction and how they are perceived are controlled by the parents. The child will suffer from a dogmatic understanding of the parents biases.  It takes time for them to understand it's a world of greys not black and white.
1.3.4.1.1.4.1.1. Con: less people then one would think understand it's a world of black and whites, and those that do have trouble keeping that in mind.
1.3.4.1.1.4.1.2. Con: Giving children the ballot incentivizes the populace to pay attention to the educationally development of children.
1.3.4.1.1.4.2. Pro: Open minded parents could contribute to an earlier understand of how the system they live in works.
1.3.4.2. Pro: For the vast majority of children [the most important role models](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Children-and-Role-Models-099.aspx) \([a person](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/role-model) who someone admires and whose behaviour they try to copy\) are their parents and caregivers.
1.3.5. Con: Grown-ups don't get their right to vote denied just because they vote the same as their family members.
1.3.5.1. Con: At the same time, the voting decisions of grown-ups are less likely to be influenced by someone else \(in this case: the parents of children\), thus giving someone else disproportional influence in the voting process.
1.3.6. Con: Whilst we know adults in a family often vote the same, we do not know that this thinking will apply to children.
1.3.7. Con: The argument that members of a household generally vote the same way and therefore should not have individual voices was also used [against women's suffrage](http://www.johndclare.net/Women1_ArgumentsAgainst.htm). Rights are granted to persons, not groups, and thus each person should have equal rights.
1.3.7.1. Con: It is not the same case. Children have lowered cognitive capabilities than adults, and less interest in politics \(on average\) than adults. They are more likely to vote with someone because their relatives/friends said it's the right thing to do than the average adult.
1.3.8. Con: If children vote in line with their family members, this does not have to be the result of passive obedience; it can also be the result of an independent decision by the child. In this case, families with many children may have more electoral weight yet there is nothing unfair about it.
1.3.9. Pro: Children are dependent on adults for food, shelter, and clothing. Giving them voting power may expose them to coercion based on that dependency. When a child is old enough to provide these things for himself, such as in an emancipation event, he should also be given the vote.
1.3.10. Pro: People could also have more kids to improve their voting power. Foster homes and those who adopt in particular could exploit this.
1.3.11. Pro: There will be the perverse incentive to increase the voting base, and maybe even a baby drive, to change the local demographics to suit the "right" families. \(right being the ones politicians want to have as there voting base\).
1.3.11.1. Con: If this were true, there is no reason it would not already be true, there may be some lag, but families do still tend to create more like minded voters when they procreate.
1.3.11.1.1. Con: The lag is 18 years and there are no guarantees that the children will vote the way their parents do \(as there goals are fundamental different then there parents at that point\).  However a 6 year old will vote the way they are told to and there survival is based of the parents success.
1.3.11.1.1.1. Con: If they vote the same because they have the same goals, then they aren't exactly being manipulated into voting differently.
1.3.12. Pro: Children will probably almost invariably vote with their parents. In order to implement this we would have to bring politics lessons into schools, but then we run the risk of their teacher being biased towards their own political views, and it's the religion-in-schools debate all over again. At the very most we could bring voting down to 16, considering the access children now have to information, but any lower and they're too impressionable.
1.3.13. Con: After a few votes, children may realize they are under influence, and break from that influence sooner. They may sooner become independent.
1.3.14. Pro: Lowering the voting age will solve nothing or even create more fraud as parents will vote for the kids via voter signoff.
1.3.15. Con: The tendency for people to be heavily influenced by how their peers and families vote does not disappear with age.
1.4. Con: Politicians can more easily manipulate or 'bribe' children and teens than adults.
1.4.1. Pro: [Children](https://harvardmagazine.com/2008/09/the-teen-brain.html) are more easily influenced by others and more prone to impulsive behavior than adults.
1.4.2. Con: The job of politicians is to 'bribe' there constituents. Having policies that the people want is how people get elected.
1.4.2.1. Con: Bribe is defined as:
-dishonestly persuade \(someone\) to act in one's favour by a gift of money or other inducement.
or
-a sum of money or other inducement offered or given to bribe someone.

A politicians job is more to represent their constituents interests and local/national needs.
1.4.3. Con: Children are arguably easier to bribe than adults. The cutoff is arbitrary.
1.4.4. Pro: Children are easy to manipulate in their political behavior.
1.4.4.1. Con: However, when a child has had time and training they sometimes rise up to be great [rulers.](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.history.com/news/history-lists/6-child-monarchs-who-changed-history)
1.4.4.2. Con: Voting is still private and confidential. A person can influence how a child may vote, but they can not control it because they can not confirm it.
1.4.4.3. Pro: There are numerous examples of child rulers who were instrumentalized by others.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: [Tsar Ivan VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_VI_of_Russia) came to power when he was two months old, but because he was so young the regent took over his kingdom and imprisoned him for 20 years.
1.4.4.3.2. Pro: [Emperor Puyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puyi) of China was crowned at two years old; his mother would end up guiding his rule until it ended shortly after this sixth birthday. As his mother was regent at the time, she ran the kingdom to its ruin.
1.4.4.4. Con: Being easily manipulated doesn't take away your right to vote as an adult. Similarly, children should have a right to vote even if they are easily manipulated.
1.4.5. Con: Maybe. But pols use fear to manipulate; a child is harder to scare with politics than an adult.
1.4.6. Con: If some politicians manipulate some voters in a unfair way, lots of adult voters will lose trust in those politicians and stop voting for them.
1.4.7. Con: Young people would learn sooner the concept of bribes, and be sooner aware of it as they grow.
1.4.8. Pro: Young children are educated through the public school system. There is a risk of opportunistic parties instilling their party values into the curriculum to garner votes. Public education should be about facts, and not votes. \(1\) They have not completed their base education \(2\) An overwhelming majority of children under 18 have not been exposed to life experiences that relate to matters which they would be voting on \(3\) Public school curriculums should not be \(more\) politicized.
1.5. Con: Children are not able to make such important and complex election decisions.
1.5.1. Pro: The [prefrontal cortex](http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/02/18/at-what-age-is-the-brain-fully-developed/) is not fully developed in children; this part of the brain is very important for crucial tasks with regards to voting such as complex planning, decision making and logical thinking.
1.5.1.1. Con: Despite their evident value to the process in theory, in practice, in part due to how voting is currently set up in America, little complex planning, decision making, or logical thinking go into people's decision when voting. If nobody else uses them, it should not matter if children can't.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Voters are chronically misinformed.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Citizens of Western countries routinely [over-estimate](https://www.theguardian.com/society/datablog/2016/dec/13/europeans-massively-overestimate-muslim-population-poll-shows) the share of Muslims among the population, for example by a factor of 17 in the US.
1.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: Citizens of many countries over-estimate the share of GDP spent on health services by a factor of two to five \([Ipsos MORI, s. 20](http://perils.ipsos.com/slides/)\).
1.5.1.1.1.3. Pro: Most people [vastly overestimate](https://borgenproject.org/us-foreign-aid-spending/) the percentage of a country's budget devoted to foreign aid.
1.5.1.1.1.4. Con: It is only rational for voters to remain ignorant and uninformed; this is not the result of stupidity. As individual votes have no chance of swaying decisions and as the costs of becoming informed can be enormous, there is little incentive to do so \([Rauch/Wittes, p. 5](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/more-professionalism-less-populism.pdf)\).
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Voters behave irrationally.
1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Voters are susceptible to influences in their decision making that make it difficult to perceive them as rational.
1.5.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Voters in American Presidential elections evaluate politicians based on events beyond their control. For example, voters punish the incumbent party for the economic losses incurred by tornadoes regardless of the actual policy response. This has been [interpreted as irrational](http://myweb.lmu.edu/ahealy/healy_malhotra_random_0310.pdf).
1.5.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: The American presidential election in 2000 between George Bush and Al Gore was close until the last days when the sheer volume of Bush's advertising campaign led to an advantage for him. That voters are susceptible to this hardly qualifies as rational \([Jonston et al., p. 184-6](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=HNqu79LXIqkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+2000+Presidential+Election+and+the+Foundations+of+Party+Politics&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjG7JHayPrTAhVOv5QKHRRxAk4Q6AEIITAA#v=onepage&q=The%20typical%20forecast%20placed%20Gore%20some%20eight%20points%20ahead%20of&f=false)\).
1.5.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: A famous example illustrating this point is the way in which American voters punished the incumbent President Wilson in 1916 for a series of random effects beyond politicians control that were seen as negative for voters' subjective well-being: shark attacks \([Achen/Bartels, p. 24f.](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/research/CSDI_WP_05-2013.pdf)\).
1.5.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The paper that made this argument has been [called into question](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/28/do-shark-attacks-swing-elections/?utm_term=.b1363aefa320) due to methodological flaws. Adjusting the analysis accordingly reveals that the effect of irrelevant events on voting behavior were overblown.
1.5.1.1.2.1.4. Pro: Research [indicates that](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/29/12804.full) even the results of college football games can influence voting behavior, with wins leading to increased support for incumbents.
1.5.1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: The study behind this argument has been [called into question](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/45/13800.full.pdf) as it might represent a false positive based on bad luck in the data selection. Other evidence points to no causal relation between football results and voting decisions.
1.5.1.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: These results received cautious confirmation from [another study](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/pub/Irrelevant%20JOP.pdf) that linked the positive mood resulting from football wins to a rise in presidential approval ratings. As the authors caution, this result is based on a small sample and shows only short-lived changes in approval.
1.5.1.1.2.1.4.3. Pro: Similar results were found by [a study](https://b2998732-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/mkmtwo/Miller-Sports.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqu1Y-PknbqcHAc3_VFKWcg49bDAj6_RtC0NAukOducN07TE9rJHLUzn9u3eWejtyHf2JriCLK8-Zwu8sjARKXTiG6l7kW5eKcC4VjltZYCLFs6lj1zWJ0aWY9_2NX6_Uakn0pfH4kllPKGQlqUzOvWZtBiP6t6O1_oskPFW24mCy8Za5n4NBZ1mi-vYaqzXod4up4GX8XxyAvBdHNICvGYm4Ns9w%3D%3D&attredirects=0) on the effects of sports results of professional teams on mayoral elections in several dozen American cities over a period of six decades.
1.5.1.1.2.1.5. Pro: Instead of selecting candidates based on the policies they advocate, voters select them for other reasons, among them party affiliation or even appearance. Once a favorite candidate has been chosen, "voters often adopt that candidate's policy views" \([Lenz, p. 18](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=5AJEAqd4XAAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Follow+the+Leader?&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiu8o7uzPrTAhWKnZQKHSF2AL0Q6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=%22for%20other%20reasons%2C%20such%20as%20performance%20advantages%2C%20party%2C%20or%20superficial%20traits%20such%20as%20appearance%22&f=false)\).
1.5.1.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: The infamous presidential television debate between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 [illustrates](http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/kennedy-nixon-debates) how the performance and even the appearance of a candidate can shift the public opinion about an otherwise even-handed debate. Referendums do not suffer from this effect.
1.5.1.1.2.1.5.1.1. Con: As the options in many referendums are linked with certain personalities, voters can still orient themselves with politicians they like or dislike. For example, voters followed Boris Johnson's in the Brexit campaign or Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan in the Turkish referendum on constitutional reform.
1.5.1.1.2.1.5.1.2. Pro: Arguably, Al Gore lost the 2000 election because he came off as  [arrogant and condescending](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/25/us/politics/george-w-bush-al-gore-2000-presidential-debate.html) in his first televised debate against Bush, despite possessing far superior policy knowledge.
1.5.1.1.2.1.6. Pro: Voters decide by the looks of politicians. Studies show that baby-faced politicians are perceived as [less competent](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103109001383) and that [good looks](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004727270900142X) can translate into electoral success.
1.5.1.1.2.1.6.1. Pro: The results of elections can even be predicted [by asking children](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1183.full) to choose candidates based on photos. They may not have political knowledge but apparently pick candidates in the same way as do voters.
1.5.1.1.2.1.6.2. Con: This can also be explained with the apathy that voters feel under the current circumstances. It causes them not to pursue information - and when they are confronted with an electoral choice, they decide based on superficial factors.
1.5.1.1.2.1.7. Pro: Psychology interferes with rational decision making. Exposure to disgusting or disturbing information, for example, led the participants of a study to express stronger convictions and harsher moral judgments \([Ben-Nun Bloom, p. 510](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.12053/abstract)\).
1.5.1.1.2.1.7.1. Pro: These effects can even be replicated for incidental, non-conscious influences. In [a study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611414726), brief exposure to images of an American flag led to a shift in voting preferences towards Republican positions for participants regardless of their prior attitudes and believe that this would not happen.
1.5.1.1.2.2. Con: As voting is considered to be an [irrational act](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/07/voting-irrational-emotions-politics-ideology) in general \(since the probability of affecting the outcome is virtually nonexistent\), citizens behave irrationally every time they go to the polls, no matter how rationally they decide. Thus irrational behavior cannot be an argument against democratic decision making.
1.5.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Voting is [not irrational](http://www.philosophyetc.net/2016/07/the-instrumental-value-of-one-vote.html). If we assume that one party is substantially better than the other, the expected value of voting is [positive](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/probdecisive2.pdf), because the costs of having a bad party are very high. Therefore, irrationality is not inherent to the act of voting, and rationality is a valid measure for assessing voter behaviour.
1.5.1.1.2.2.2. Con: Voting may be irrational if seen strictly from the perspective of the individual. But it becomes rational to vote once it is taken into account that democratic systems would collapse if each and every voter would act - according to this logic - rational and not vote.
1.5.1.1.2.3. Pro: According to the theory of [Rational Irrationality](http://www.owl232.net/irrationality.htm#4), voters adopt irrational beliefs as the costs of becoming informed \(time, mental effort\) exceed the benefits.
1.5.1.1.2.4. Con: The [lack of a single agreed-upon definition](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0175.xml) of rationality shows how controversial the definition of rationality is. This implies that it is impossible to objectively determine whether a single act is irrational.
1.5.1.1.2.4.1. Con: Even though we lack a single agreed-upon definition, there is a general understanding of what constitutes rational behavior. And while one can disagree about the rationality of specific actions, there is little dispute about the observation that voters do not live up to the standard of fully rational behavior.
1.5.1.1.2.5. Pro: Voters do not act in accordance with their own opinions and stated preferences. This clearly is a case of irrational behavior.
1.5.1.1.2.5.1. Pro: The American Congress usually has a public approval rating of below 20%; a third of voters believe that their representative is corrupt, half that they are out of touch and serve special interests \([Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx)\). Yet only about 5% of the members of Congress who run for re-election in any given year are voted out of office \([CRS, p. 6](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41545.pdf)\).
1.5.1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: This behaviour is rational if voters equally believed that their representative's opponents are equally corrupt, out of touch, or subservient to special interests.
1.5.1.1.2.5.2. Pro: Right before the presidential elections that kept Clinton, Bush and Obama in office for another four years, a [majority of voters](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx) were dissatisfied with the general direction the country was heading into - yet they chose to reelect the incumbent.
1.5.1.1.2.5.2.1. Con: It is questionable whether this data can tell us much. The last time a majority of Americans was actually satisfied with the direction of the country [was in 2003](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx). Voter satisfaction thus seems generally low.
1.5.1.1.2.5.2.2. Con: This preference set is not irrational. It's perfectly reasonable to think that the country is heading in a bad direction, but that the incumbent is nevertheless the better of two bad options.
1.5.1.1.2.6. Con: Rationality is not a binary divide. Reasons for voting can be more or less rational, but are rarely fully devoid of some sort of reason. Democracy predicts that all people are irrational to some extent, which is why it provides power to the entire population as a safeguard against the irrationality of one person having undue influence. Experience and science however tells us that there is a basic level of development children must reach before they can be entrusted with certain responsibilities.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: It's not uncommon for one's vote to be determined by a single issue, like abortion, or racism, and since it's set up to be one of two choices, it usually ends up being pretty black and white.
1.5.1.1.4. Con: This is an oversimplification of America's complex and [highly diverse](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/03/2016-electorate-will-be-the-most-diverse-in-u-s-history/) electorate.
1.5.1.1.4.1. Pro: [Ethnic background](http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/content/how-americas-diversity-explosion-changing-political-landscape), [income and education](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/education-not-income-predicted-who-would-vote-for-trump/) highly influence US citizens' voting behavior and choices.
1.5.1.2. Con: Those with underdeveloped prefrontal cortexes are not prevented from voting.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: Adults who suffer from prefrontal cortex defects are predisposed to [violence and crime](http://www.neulaw.org/blog/1034-class-blog/3937-prefrontal-cortex-defects-and-execution). Thus, with regards to the debate's assumption, these individuals should loose their voting rights rather than minors should receive them.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: A predisposition is not a destiny, regardless of predisposition, it is still ultimately the individuals choice, at least if they are being tried normally, and those who don't have this predisposition can still commit crimes.
1.5.1.3. Pro: It is true that not all voters vote rationally using their prefrontal cortex, but we as a society should ensure that as many voters as possible are equipped with fully matured brains.
1.5.1.4. Con: The prefrontal cortex is not fully developed until age 25. We only prevent voting up to age 18. if the prefrontal cortex was the reason for denying children the right to vote, there would not be this 7 year discrepancy.
1.5.1.4.1. Con: The [cortex's development](http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/02/18/at-what-age-is-the-brain-fully-developed/) goes gradually: you can expect an 18-year-old to be far more advanced than a 10-year-old.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Con: We can expect a 25 year old to be far more advanced then an 18 year old. If it is worth waiting for one, it's worth waiting for the other.
1.5.1.4.1.2. Con: That logic could be used to strip the mentally disabled of their voting rights.
1.5.1.5. Con: Being able to only make poor choices with regards to your future is still considerably better then not being able to make any choice with regards to your future.
1.5.1.5.1. Con: A child can chose to run into the street, or not be given the right to choose to run into the street. In this and many other cases, making poor choices is worse.
1.5.1.5.1.1. Con: Where running into the streets is possible, the restrictions necessary to disable a child from running into a street would basically mean forbidding them from exiting the house, which would be much worse then the slight chance they would run into the street.
1.5.1.6. Con: Just because the average size of a decision-making center of the brain is lower in this age group does not mean that one children's decision-making abilities are lower than adults'. It very well could be that we are taking the right away from a very able citizen just because of generalizing data.
1.5.2. Pro: Children tend to put too much emphasis upon immediate effects and immediate gratification.
1.5.2.1. Con: The nature of our legislative process is intentional slow, which should serve as an effective counterbalance to the impulsive nature of some voters.
1.5.3. Con: This is the same wording, almost precisely, applied to women at the turn of the 20th century.
1.5.3.1. Con: The argument is invalid regarding gender, as that detail doesn't directly correlate to one's mental ability. One's age, however, does.
1.5.3.2. Pro: To add, when it came time to let African American people vote, the point was made by people that they shouldn't be allowed to vote because of low knowledge politically seeking. Of course, this is because the general, non-activist population had no need to learn of politics, as the right to vote had not even been offered to them.
1.5.4. Con: The common voter is not an expert either. Many voters decide important issues based on gut feelings. Yet these adults are still allowed to vote.
1.5.4.1. Con: Even adults sometimes do not have enough knowledge to make a valid, informed and accurate choice by voting - how can kids who barely understand the system vote? It does not make any sense. Shall we allow them to drive as well?
1.5.5. Con: This claim should be considered weak at best, as there are in fact children who are capable of this kind of complex reasoning \(and demonstrably more capable than some adults, if we're to believe certain game shows on TV\).
1.5.6. Pro: The decision processes needed to vote are based on being able to understand concepts and their impact on society. Children do not normally begin to [develop](https://www.verywellmind.com/piagets-stages-of-cognitive-development-2795457) [conceptual thinking](https://www.learningrx.com/4-cognitive-stages-for-child-development-faq.htm) until they reach 13-15, and many do not develop those skills until much later. This means that in most cases children are unable to process the complex concepts involved with making the decisions needed to become good voters. The ability to cast a ballot is different than the ability to cast a ballot wisely.
1.5.7. Pro: Unlike adults, children lack the experience necessary to make independent political decisions.
1.5.7.1. Pro: Children lack the knowledge and experience necessary to adequately express themselves, both in picking a candidate and conveying what they want beyond an immediate level response: "I don't like grandpa so no social security for him".
1.5.7.2. Pro: Children almost universally lack the experience needed to make correct life decisions; therefore, giving them the right to vote is not wise.
1.5.7.2.1. Pro: Children have no immediate experience with many of the issues that dominate elections, for example regarding work, pensions and insurances.
1.5.7.2.1.1. Con: Many issues that effect children are overlooked because children are not on the ballot. Who is given the ballot inevitably decides what it on it.
1.5.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: Sometimes we rely too heavily on the parents having the best interest of their children at heart. Children have their own best interest at heart all the time.
1.5.7.2.1.2. Con: Farmers, in general, do not have a good understanding of laws dealing with traffic congestion, nor do factory workers have a good understanding of agricultural subsidies, yet both these groups vote on both of these issues.
1.5.7.2.1.3. Con: If children have the power to influence these issues, this will give people a reason to teach children about them, which prepares children for when these issues matter to them.
1.5.7.2.1.4. Con: Children don't have the full story, but they do have a partial understanding of at least some of these issues. They understand, for example, when a parent comes home late, and how that personally effects them. This is a part of the full story that our system currently does not have.
1.5.7.3. Pro: Most children don't fully understand the matter they're facing and thus cannot decide well. if they're told to decide, they usually do it based on things they hear from people around them. they don't have their own opinion yet and can be easily persuaded to choose/vote something by irresponsible party.
1.5.8. Pro: Children are more likely to make a vote based on [emotion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4131311/) rather than one made on logic and facts.
1.5.8.1. Con: Voting is generally an act primarily [based on emotions](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/07/voting-irrational-emotions-politics-ideology) irrespective of the voters' age.
1.5.8.1.1. Con: While that may be true, it should be fought, not encouraged. Allowing children to vote would only encourage emotion-based voting, rather than fact-based voting, which adults are far more capable of.
1.5.9. Pro: Children have no interest in the matters most important to elections. The vast majority know nothing about economics and will not wish to learn. Let children enjoy their childhoods without the added pressures of expecting them to have deep understandings and strong opinions on such complex matters.
1.5.10. Con: Allowing children to vote could make those important decisions less complex and easier in turn \(to everyone\), because both laws and politic processes would have to be simplified in order to help children to defend their opinions.
1.5.11. Pro: The problem is that children do not think for themselves. They often take after their friends' ideas.
1.5.12. Pro: Children might not take voting serious or even see it as a joke, picking the person who looks uglier, or fatter.
1.6. Pro: The decisions made via voting affect children for a longer time than anyone else. Thus, they should have their say.
1.6.1. Con: Children evolve and change as they grow older, thus they aren't voting on behalf of their future selves, but on behalf of themselves as a child.
1.6.1.1. Con: Lifetime appointments and world changing funding decisions are still being made in their complete absence.
1.6.1.2. Con: Voting does not have to be selfish, changes will benefit the next generation of children.
1.6.2. Con: By that logic, children should be able to decide if they go to school or not, whether they eat their vegetables, etc. The fact that a child will face the consequences of a choice does not imply that the child understands the situation or is in the best position to make that choice.
1.7. Pro: Those who die young are currently robbed of the ability to affect the government ever in their lifetime. This may lead to issues such as childhood illnesses to being undervalued.
1.7.1. Con: Those who die young are unable to affect anyone else's lived experience. Someone who knows nothing at all about how life or how society runs impact on government would be minimal/nonexistent at best.
1.7.1.1. Con: Depending on the specific laws of the country or state \(and historically\) the "young" are up to 16, 18 or even 21 years old.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: For the purposes of the debate, the cut off point for what is young has not been made yet. There are places in the world where the age to vote is 15. My understanding has been that we are trying to lower it to the moment A child can physically vote \(so like 2\). And I'm not sure that a 2 year old dying before they have a chance to vote should effect those currently living.
1.7.2. Con: Parents push hard for childhood health and illness issues, they push hard for education and issues that effect their children. They feel the loss of a child that they promote change and focus on child issues \(vaccinations, mid-night runs to emergencies centers for any type of illness, doing anything they can for there children\).
1.7.2.1. Pro: The phrase "Think of the Children!" is already somewhat sterotypical.
1.7.2.2. Con: Children died in mass shootings for such a long period of time with no political action, that the only reason it seems like there might be some change on the horizon is that the people who grew up knowing these events as regular are now old enough to vote.
1.7.3. Con: Infant, child, and teen mortality is on a drastic decline, especially in [western democracies](http://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/mortality_causes_text/en/).
1.7.4. Con: Children cannot currently vote. Thus, them not voting has already led \(past tense\) to whatever issues it is going to. It cannot "lead" \(future tense\) to additional issues since this is the status quo.
1.8. Con: Not all children are taught the principles of how government operates in the same way through public education, and thus are not equally and fully informed of how their vote can be effective when voting for president, representatives and senators on local, state and federal levels.
1.8.1. Con: The differences in people's education do not disappear when they reach legal voting age. Rather the opposite: these differences tend to grow even larger over time, such as some people going to university after public school, while some don't. So the exact same argument could be used to explain why grownups shouldn't be allowed to vote.
1.8.2. Con: Education is generally not a requirement in order to vote in democratic societies.
1.8.3. Con: Anyone can learn how their state works by looking it up on the internet. That's how most adults already do it \(when they do it\).
1.8.4. Pro: With an effective introduction into these affairs, minors could be tested voluntarily. Passing scores would earn suffrage; failed scores would have to retake the education if they still wanted to try for the right.
1.8.5. Con: The same could be said for a segment of adults, but they still have the right to vote.
1.9. Pro: Allowing children to vote would increase the weight of families in the political process without violating the principle of one person having only one vote.
1.9.1. Con: A family can be composed of people from different political sides.
1.9.2. Con: Voting is an individual and personal process, so increasing the weight of families does not make sense in a democracy.
1.10. Con: Based on the assumption that a significant part of parents will force their children to vote in order to raise them as good democrats, being able to vote will create a burden for many children.
1.10.1. Pro: Same as [religious parents](https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/religion-beliefs-and-parenting-practices) try to raise and educate their offspring in accordance with their beliefs and habits convinced democrats likely do the same.
1.10.2. Con: Most major legislative periods are between four and five years. Therefore, there will be hardly any significant burdens.
1.10.2.1. Con: It's bad enough that most eligible voters don't follow politics until just before a major election; let's not encourage children to do the same. Also; there public voting opportunities at all levels of government - there would almost always be an upcoming 'vote' for them to focus on.
1.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.
1.11. Pro: Children are directly affected by some state decisions \(school system etc.\), therefore their opinion on these subjects is valuable.
1.12. Con: Children have less obligations, therefore they should have less rights.
1.12.1. Pro: Children are treated as minors in justice.
1.12.2. Pro: Children are not expected to pay taxes.
1.12.2.1. Con: Many people are not expected to pay taxes. For example, people who have no money.
1.12.2.2. Con: Children do pay taxes. When they have jobs, they pay income taxes. When they own property, they are subject to property taxes. And when they buy goods, they are subject to sales taxes.
1.12.3. Pro: Children are not subject to military service.
1.12.3.1. Con: Old people and disabled people are also not subject to military service. In many countries, including the US, women are never subject to mandatory military service.
1.12.4. Con: Children will eventually bear the obligations.
1.12.5. Con: There are very, very few obligations that apply universally to all civilian citizens.
1.12.6. Pro: Children are subject to special care and protection which shall ensure that children do not have to bear the same obligations as adults. According to the [Declaration of the Rights of the Child](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/child-rights/international-law.php) children are entitled to adequate nutrition, housing, recreation, and medical services; to an education; to protection against neglect, cruelty and exploitation, trafficking and underage labor.
1.13. Con: Extending the vote to young children is logistically too difficult.
1.13.1. Pro: Young children often do not have the capacity to go to the polls by themselves and therefore require assistance.
1.13.2. Pro: Providing children with mail-in ballots increases the chance of fraud by having non-eligible adults \(like non-citizens\) vote on their behalf.
1.14. Con: Society considers children too immature for a variety of actions that might negatively affect other people or society as a whole. The same goes for voting.
1.14.1. Pro: Children are prohibited from driving as they are not trusted with cars and other vehicles, even though they might be physically able to drive them.
1.14.2. Pro: Children are prohibited from drinking alcohol, in part because they cannot be trusted to not engage in unsafe behavior under the influence.
