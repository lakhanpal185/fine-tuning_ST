Discussion Title: Is America an exceptional country?

1. America is not an exceptional country.
1.1. Pro: Large parts of the American population have been left behind and are in no superior or exceptional position relative to the rest of the world.
1.1.1. Pro: Income inequality is [extremely high](http://www.oecd.org/social/inequality.htm) in America.
1.1.1.1. Con: An unequal distribution of wealth does not mean that the country as a whole is not rich or that anyone isn't well-off in absolute terms.
1.1.2. Con: America has [one of the highest GDP per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)_per_capita) worldwide and is only bested by much smaller nations.
1.1.2.1. Con: If you account for the [extreme income inequality](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2015/demo/distribution-of-household-income--2014.html), the per capita figures means nothing as it is bias because of some individuals extreme wealth. The link shows how the distribution is far from normal.
1.2. Pro: USA has one of the highest murder rates for a civilised country.
1.2.1. Con: The USA is hard to compare to many civilized countries due to significant differences. Two easy variables would be lack of a homogeneous population and the USA is relatively new relative to many other civilized countries.
1.2.1.1. Con: There is no evidence to suggest that homogeneity is related to murder rates.
1.2.1.2. Con: The culture of all western nations is constantly evolving regardless of net migration, therefore there is no "new" or "old".
1.3. Con: America is a global leader in science and technology.
1.3.1. Pro: The US was the first country on the moon.
1.3.1.1. Con: The Moon Landing took place half a century ago. Even if the US may have been exceptional at the time, this does not have to tell us anything about its present situation.
1.3.1.2. Pro: The US space program was more technologically advanced than lesser developed nations like the Soviet Union. Putting the first man on the moon was not achieved by the Soviets nor at any time by the USSR with a manned landing.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: In the same manner, the US has never sent a probe which can withstand Venus atmospheric difficulties. The USSR was the only country in history to [take pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_7) of the Venus surface.
1.3.1.3. Con: The US brought the first human to the moon, but was not the first to reach the moon. The USSR [was first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_2).
1.3.2. Pro: America leads the world in [Nobel laureates](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11926364/Nobel-Prize-winners-Which-country-has-the-most-Nobel-laureates.html).
1.3.2.1. Con: Unfortunately, [per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_laureates_per_capita), the US has a far less impressive tally. When corrected for population, once again, the claim of US superiority is flawed.
1.3.3. Con: America is leading in pure number of publications produced, but the quality of these publications falls behind other countries which have greater numbers of citations per paper. In this regard, America ranks [15th](https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?order=cd&ord=desc) for the years 1996-2017. In 2016, it was ranked 101st and in 2017 it was ranked 78th.
1.4. Pro: The USA has the highest incarceration rate in the world.
1.4.1. Pro: The trying of underage criminals as adults is unjust and is done to seek the maximum sentence not rehabilitation.
1.4.1.1. Con: If a criminal demonstrates appropriate mens rea they should be charged with the appropriate statute regardless of age.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Mens rea typically isn't the appropriate standard. Courts usually examine age and criminal history when determining sentencing.
1.4.1.2. Pro: There is no evidence to suggest that sentencing minors to adult sentences is successful in terms of rehabilitation
1.5. Pro: Social freedoms are lacking for a so called country that boasts about freedom, e.g. the legal age of drinking.
1.5.1. Pro: Many states don't allow smoking in public places, nor near a doorway.
1.5.1.1. Con: This is considered progress in many places, not a lack of social freedom.
1.5.1.2. Con: Smoking has been proven so many times to be harmful to health and so is second hand smoking. Smoking represents a huge cost to society and should be confined to private places.
1.5.2. Pro: Open alcohol containers are restricted in many states.
1.5.2.1. Con: Public intoxication increases the chance of accidents happening \(e.g. running into the middle of the street\) therefore present a cost to society
1.5.3. Pro: Walking on the road is often an offense.
1.5.3.1. Con: Walking on the roads increases the chances of accidents and represents a cost for soceity
1.5.4. Con: Freedom of speech is exceptionally good in the US, despite a recent decline in it's acceptance.
1.5.4.1. Con: Not where it matters. Snowden showed the unconstitutional actions of the government that mattered, and he was hunted. Snowden first of all was loyal to the constitution first, and to the secret government institution second.
1.6. Con: America is a cultural leader of the world, they produce a large portion of the media that is consumed across the world including movies, music, TV etc...
1.7. Pro: Americas infatuation with guns is a source of mirth in civilized countries elsewhere in the world.
1.8. Con: America has an exceptionally strong economy.
1.8.1. Con: America's economy isn't [growing quickly](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?cid=GPD_30&year_high_desc=true).
1.8.1.1. Con: [Sustainable GDP](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-ideal-gdp-growth-rate-3306017) growth is roughly 2-3%, on average the US is doing fine \(there are natural peaks and troughs\).
1.8.2. Con: The economy is an indicator of how well big business in said country is doing. Case in point Wells Fargo was driving the economy up by stealing from it's citizens. Does that make America Great? Not saying all Big business's are doing this, but Business income has grown faster compared to employee income. Proving my point that big business/economy could be doing great but the rest of America can be not as well.
1.8.3. Con: The United States leads neither in [real GDP](https://knoema.com/nwnfkne/world-gdp-ranking-2017-gdp-by-country-data-and-charts) nor [GDP per capita](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?year_high_desc=true).
1.8.4. Con: America's labor force participation rate is [lagging](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.ZS?year_high_desc=true).
1.8.5. Con: America doesn't boast [the freest economy](https://www.heritage.org/index/ranking).
1.8.6. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.8.7. Con: The US economy is strong, but its foundations are weak because it uses fiat currency, protected through violent means like sanctions, arming minorities to create internal issues, or armed invasions.
1.8.8. Pro: America's GDP accounts for [about a quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)) of the world's total economic output. No other nations comes close. China, though on the second rank, accounts for only about 15%.
1.9. Pro: America has a history of starting wars for tenuous reasons and then failing to win them.
