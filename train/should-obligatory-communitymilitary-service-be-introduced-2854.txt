Discussion Title: Should Obligatory Community/Military Service Be Introduced?

1. Obligatory Community/Military Service Should Be Introduced.
1.1. Pro: Citizens have a moral duty to serve their society in return for the various rights and privileges that they are granted by society.
1.1.1. Con: Many citizens are oppressed by their states. Ethnic minorities, women, and other groups suffer as a result of ingrained patriarchy, racism, and systems of privilege which exclude them. These citizens do not have a moral duty to serve a state complicit in, or passive towards, their marginalization.
1.1.1.1. Pro: If citizens are free from conscription, they have more time available to work towards fixing those problems in their societies.
1.1.2. Con: Citizens are not morally obligated to put their lives on the line for the state.
1.1.2.1. Con: People who are concerned about, or simply do not want to serve in the military, would likely choose community service instead.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: 18 year old adolescents may be seduced by romantic notions of military service.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: A societal perception of military service as heroic and brave may push individuals to join without properly thinking it through.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: There may be peer pressure to join the military if community service is considered "chickening out" or passing up a duty to one's country.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: This is a common phenomena in the [IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refusal_to_serve_in_the_IDF), where draft avoidance is heavily stigmatized.
1.1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Nationalism and norms of masculinity can intersect to make the military a place where many men and boys feel like they must serve.
1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Military service is often [glorified](http://openanthropology.org/Good_Intentions_Ch8_Militarism_Militainment_PTSD_Powell.pdf) in the media and in fictional narratives.
1.1.2.1.1.4. Con: If this were true, it would be expected that more young people would sign up for military service voluntarily however most do not.
1.1.2.1.2. Con: This assumes that people are able to predict the stresses the military will pose to them; it is likely that they will underestimate the effect it could have on them.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: People are notoriously bad at weighing short and long term effects. It is very difficult to conceptualize the mental health effects that the military might have on oneself before joining. As a result, individuals are likely to downplay long term harms that military service might have.
1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Studies have indicated](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/04/why_people_are_so_bad_at_thinking_about_the_future.html) that when humans attempt to conceptualize their future selves, it is as if they are conceptualizing an entirely different person.
1.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: The limbic parts of the brain are [heavily stimulated](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-bugs/201209/temporal-myopia-making-bad-long-term-decisions) by the prospect of immediate gratification, which clouds judgement.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: Most people are by their nature risk averse. If one thinks there's a chance that they might not be able to handle military service, then it makes sense to just opt into community service instead.
1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: The human brain has a [negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias), wherein individuals are more likely to remember, conceptualize, and weigh the probability of negative things happening than positive ones. This bias elicits risk averse behavior.
1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Negativity bias serves an evolutionary purpose. Remembering bad or dangerous consequences of actions makes individuals behave more safely and thereby become more likely to reproduce.
1.1.2.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Negativity bias is constantly apparent in human life. One bad experience can ruin a day full of great experiences for example. Or a single bad experience doing a certain activity may persuade someone to never do it again.
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Having an opt-out mechanism would allow people who are opposed to the violent aspects of the military to contribute to the country like the rest of their peers.
1.1.2.2. Con: The state ensures that its citizens are safe for most of their life. It is fair to demand that citizens spend a small portion of their life to help the state protect its citizens.
1.1.2.3. Con: If citizens are happy to allow others to put their lives on the line to protect all, it is unclear why they shouldn't also be expected to do so.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: Because people do not have any say in how others spend their lives, it is unfair to act as if they do.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: If people are willing to let other people do something, that does not imply that those people can be expected to do that thing. For example, many people are happy to allow others to donate to charity, but that fact doesn't obligate them to also donate to charity.
1.1.3. Con: Debt requires prior consent. Citizens have no ability to choose the state they are born in to, and as such, do not have any obligation to serve the state.
1.1.3.1. Con: Then, given that the state has no ability to choose who is born into it, the state has no obligation to its native-born adult population, and state-provided public services, welfare and justice can be denied to those who refuse conscription.
1.1.3.2. Con: This is an argument against all forms of civic duty. However at the point that we accept the existence of other duties, there is no principle reason why service could not also be included.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Other forms of civic duty are not as invasive, dangerous or time consuming as military service.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: Citizens already contribute to their society by paying taxes and abiding by its laws.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Beyond legal requirements, citizens also contribute to society through their work.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Citizens get paid wages as compensation for the work that they do, balancing out their contribution.
1.1.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: People who work in manufacturing industries directly contribute to the happiness of citizens by producing goods they consume.
1.1.3.2.2.1.3. Pro: Producers of all forms of art positively impact upon the culture of society which is beneficial for the health of its citizens.
1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Taxes are paid relative to individual circumstances, rather than equally, as this is a more efficient way of contributing to society. Conscription would not follow this logic of efficiency.
1.1.3.2.2.2.1. Con: This progressive form of taxation is not due to efficiency but instead capacity: it would be impossible for everyone to pay the same tax. The same is not true for service as everyone could contribute equally.
1.1.3.2.2.2.1.1. Con: People vary in physical capabilities and competence.
1.1.3.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Those who are physically weaker cannot contribute as much as those who are in good physical shape.
1.1.3.2.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Intelligent people and well-educated people are better positioned to be able to contribute more during their service than those who are less intelligent or lack technical skills that are useful for service.
1.1.3.2.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that those who are more intelligent will automatically do better in an environment such as the military.
1.1.3.2.2.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: More intelligent people may be less suited to the pace and style of the military meaning that they in fact do worse than some of their fellow recruits.
1.1.3.2.2.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: More intelligent people could be used in roles that require a sharp intellect, such as overseeing and developing military tactics or administrative assignments.
1.1.3.2.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: Some people have an easier time to learn and execute tasks than others. This means that some will be able to more quickly learn their assignments and will do a better job executing it while serving.
1.1.3.2.2.3. Con: There is a suite of ways in which governments can expect their citizens to contribute. Just because they pay taxes does not mean they should not contribute in other ways as well.
1.1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: The taxes that citizens pay are spent on improving the lives of the very same citizens. This should not be considered a significant contribution to society.
1.1.3.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: In this way, compulsory service is directly analogous to paying taxes: as a beneficiary of a service from the state, one must directly contribute to the maintenance of that service.
1.1.3.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The maintenance of service provided by the state is supposed to be covered through taxes. If current taxes are insufficient then it would be more reasonable to raise taxes than to force people to perform labor on behalf of the state.
1.1.3.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This assumes that money would be able to fix the issue of low service rates. However, labour seems to be the more pressing issue, so forced labour would be a more sensible solution than higher taxes.
1.1.3.3. Con: Citizens may not choose the state but they do benefit from the state. Given this it is reasonable to exact some form of payment from them.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.
1.1.3.3.2. Con: This is the very essence of immorality and authoritarianism. If agreements are not made with the consent of both parties, then those agreements are abusive.
1.1.3.4. Con: This logic leads to implausible conclusions. It would justify someone breaking any law they did not agree with as they did not choose their state.
1.1.3.4.1. Con: Breaking laws one does not agree with is not an implausible conclusion. The moral righteousness of the state is certainly not a given. The sheer volume of states that have enforced widely-recognized unethical laws should be evidence enough of the flaw in the belief in the righteousness of the law of the state.
1.1.3.4.2. Con: There is a difference between positive and negative rights and duties. In this case, it is legitimate to force citizens to inaction \(by stopping them commit crimes\) but not to force them to action \(by requiring service\).
1.1.3.4.2.1. Con: Other forced actions like paying taxes are legitimate.
1.1.3.4.2.2. Con: This claim rests on a vast complex of other unsubstantiated claims, principally that the exercising of state force is somehow "legitimate." It raises distinctly unresolved questions of when, why and how that supposed legitimacy takes shape.
1.1.3.4.2.3. Con: It is no more legitimate to expect others to bear the weight of and consequences of our decisions voluntarily or otherwise. If someone wants war, they ought to be the first to enlist.
1.1.3.5. Con: Citizens do not choose the state they are born to, but they implicitly consent to the rules imposed by the state and the reciprocal obligations imposed by the state by choosing not to leave.
1.1.3.5.1. Con: Immigration is too expensive for the majority of human beings on the planet to be a real option. As such, most people cannot make the conscious decision to leave the state in which they are born.
1.1.3.5.2. Con: People have intimate, deep-rooted connections to other people and support systems within their own countries, which make it an unreasonable burden to require that they leave if they do not respect oppressive laws.
1.1.3.5.3. Con: Compulsory service acts upon people at the age of 18. In order to avoid the service they would need to make the choice to leave at an age younger than we recognise their ability to consent. This makes it an impossible choice.
1.1.3.5.4. Con: If people were to leave, they would end up living in another state with similar restrictions.
1.1.3.5.4.1. Con: If they did move to a sovereign state with conscription, it would likely not apply to them as a migrant worker.
1.1.3.5.4.2. Con: There are many sovereign states without conscription.
1.1.3.6. Pro: Non-adult citizens lack the legal autonomy to choose whether or not they wish to accept the benefits and privileges they receive from the state in return for serving their country.
1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.
1.1.5. Pro: [The Lieber code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Lieber), the foundation upon which the Geneva Conventions were built, was drafted on the basis of a philosophy of "no right without its duties, no duty without its rights". They therefore constitute a core part of international law and thinking.
1.1.6. Pro: [Social Contract Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) posits that individuals have consented to surrender some of their freedoms in exchange for protection of their remaining rights.
1.1.6.1. Pro: The [reciprocal relationship](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3707&context=flr) between rights and responsibilities is a moral and practical requirement for the proper functioning of states; a relationship that ensures that both are adhered to.
1.1.7. Pro: Society needs to find a balance between rights and responsibilities/obligations. Mandatory national service doesn't have to be military - it can be environmental or social projects. National service can contribute too/pay for tertiary education.
1.1.8. Con: Military service often doesn't serve the society, but only a fraction of it.
1.1.9. Pro: A just society should be a balance of rights and responsibilities. There are enough threats against the state, environmental, societal and existential that all must compromise some of their choices for the greater good.
1.1.10. Pro: States ensure that citizens are guaranteed protection under the law and by the police.
1.1.10.1. Con: States frequently do not ensure that citizens are guaranteed protection under the law and by the police.
1.1.10.2. Con: Citizens cannot meaningfully consent to police protection as it is an artificially created government institution to which there are no feasible alternatives.
1.1.10.2.1. Con: Citizens cannot meaningfully consent to any imposed governmental structure but this does not imply that they are inherently wrong.
1.1.10.3. Pro: Without the state to enforce the law, society would likely descend into anarchy.
1.1.10.3.1. Pro: There is no reason for an individual to obey the law solely because it is the law. The only reason people obey is out of fear of punishment. Without state enforcement no one would obey laws.
1.1.10.3.1.1. Con: Individuals create norms of appropriate behavior in order to be able to coexist peacefully in society. It is likely that most people would still abide by these normative codes of ethics without a state as the desire to be able to live together in harmony would still exist.
1.1.10.3.2. Pro: Ascending to anarchy would be preferable to the ongoing abuses of state law enforcement. Those citizen who are currently targeted, harassed, and killed by their state would begin to experience liberation.
1.1.10.3.3. Con: Private police companies could replace state employed police.
1.1.10.3.3.1. Con: Private police forces would be unreliable as they are primarily concerned with profit incentive unlike state police forces whose primary concerns are protecting society.
1.1.10.3.3.2. Con: Private police forces could not be employed by economically disadvantaged communities.
1.1.10.3.3.3. Con: It is harder to hold private police accountable for their actions as no one but the private organization themselves can hold the private police accountable. The laws that exist in a state with a government act as a way of holding any criminal accountable independently of the police institution.
1.1.11. Pro: States provide their citizens with the right to due process.
1.1.12. Pro: States provide their citizens with access to many things such as infrastructure and education.
1.1.12.1. Pro: Infrastructure and education are public goods, so even though they are in demand, the free market does not supply them because they are not profitable. The state is therefore the sole provider of these goods.
1.1.12.2. Con: The state uses the citizens' own money, collected in the form of taxes, to provide these communal benefits.
1.1.12.2.1. Con: The state is still responsible for collecting, aggregating and spending money on communal goods which individuals could not afford for themselves.
1.1.13. Pro: States protect their citizens from alien threats.
1.1.13.1. Con: Each citizen should be free to choose what means, if any, are appropriate to protect themself from alien threats.
1.1.13.1.1. Con: The nature of these threats renders this impractical. Individual citizens cannot protect themselves against the sort of threats that other states can pose.
1.1.13.1.1.1. Con: That it is impractical does not justify removing this freedom. Citizens may still choose to voluntarily join the military in efforts to protect their state and by extension, themselves.
1.1.13.2. Con: The state is often poor at correctly assessing the nature of alien threats.
1.1.13.2.1. Con: Even if the state occasionally incorrectly assesses the extent of a threat, they are still better placed to make this evaluation than any individual citizen.
1.1.13.3. Pro: Given that the military is necessary to provide this ability, it is fair that the state should require their citizens to maintain it.
1.1.13.3.1. Pro: Since it is almost impossible to tell when an attack will occur, the military has to be maintained in equal strength at all times.
1.1.13.3.1.1. Con: Contemporary geopolitical relations gives a fair idea of how likely an attack from a foreign country is. If there's no reason to expect any attack within the foreseeable future, maintaining the military at full strength at all times is unnecessary.
1.1.13.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Conflict trends](http://file.prio.no/publication_files/prio/Gates,%20Nyg%C3%A5rd,%20Strand,%20Urdal%20-%20Trends%20in%20Armed%20Conflict,%20Conflict%20Trends%201-2016.pdf) suggest that both the frequency of wars, and the amount of battle-related deaths, is decreasing over time, making the threat of war increasingly unlikely.
1.1.14. Con: In reality, not all members of society are treated equally under conscription. This 'moral duty' would thus only be served by those who could not escape the draft.
1.1.14.1. Pro: Rich families or politicians could pull strings and have their children assigned to non-combat roles or to relatively peaceful countries or even exempted from service altogether to keep them out of harm's way.
1.1.14.1.1. Pro: [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_military_service_controversy) used his influence to line up an enlistment in the local National Guard unit. He rarely showed up for duty and effectively sat out the Vietnam War, even though conscription was in place.
1.1.14.1.2. Pro: [Alan Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Clark), whose family was extremely rich and well connected, [found him a way out of serving](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/dodging-national-service-a-dishonourable-tradition-2029753.html). As a schoolboy, he joined a training regiment a short walk away in Windsor, which he left before he went to college. He later used this experience as a pretext to get himself exempted from National Service.
1.1.14.1.3. Pro: [A survey](http://A survey conducted by the government-run Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training \(KRIVET\) last summer showed that young men from wealthier, better educated families are more likely to avoid military service. Read more at https://asiancorrespondent.com/2014/03/koreans-shun-military-service-as-survey-shows-rich-dodge-draft/#F79EbLf27XUhKEgR.99) conducted by the government-run Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training \(KRIVET\) last summer showed that young men from wealthier, better educated families are more likely to avoid military service.
1.1.14.1.4. Pro: [Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/donald-trump-draft-record.html?_r=1) is suspected to have given a false medical diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels resulting in a coveted 1-Y medical deferment from the Vietnam War.
1.1.14.2. Con: The exemptions to this policy would presumably be rare which minimises the problem of unfairness.
1.1.15. Pro: States provide emergency services and take responsibility for their citizens in the face of disasters, major accidents or economic crises.
1.2. Con: States with a surplus of conscripts will deploy them in harmful ways.
1.2.1. Pro: States with a surplus of soldiers are likely to use them in domestic peacekeeping/policing roles \(e.g. [Singapore](https://www.vagabondjourney.com/national-service-military-conscription-in-singapore/)\). This is likely to be harmful.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Soldiers are taught to shoot on command and follow orders without thought. This makes them dangerous as domestic police forces.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: In most instances this isn't true. Soldiers are trained heavily to follow extensive[rules of engagement](http://www.trngcmd.marines.mil/Portals/207/Docs/TBS/B130936%20Law%20of%20War%20and%20Rules%20Of%20Engagement.pdf) and international law regarding war crimes.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: US-led occupation forces have committed numerous [atrocities](https://www.globalpolicy.org/invasion-and-war/atrocities-and-criminal-homicides-.html) in Iraq since the invasion of 2003. This suggests that soldiers may struggle to follow the extensive rules of engagements despite the training.
1.2.1.2. Con: This is good. Law enforcement in many countries such as the US needs [diversity](http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-police-department-diversity.html) in order to better represent the communities they serve. A program of conscription would help to provide that.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The lack of inclusiveness in the military may be a product of its current makeup, which lacks diversity. When many more people serve, the military will become demographically more representative of wider society, which will improve the institution.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: It is unlikely that compulsory service would change the diversity of people in the military when compared to the status quo.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.2.1.2.2.2. Con: Countries [such as Lebanon](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/multiethnic-armies-and-national-unity) have historically had very homogeneous militaries made up of a particular sector of the population. Conscription, therefore, is likely to greatly increase diversity in these militaries.
1.2.1.2.2.3. Con: The French military used to be extremely [diverse](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesinternational/2015/01/15/france-failed-its-cultural-diversity-policy/#123cc20f844a) during the 1940s when France had conscription during WWII, but since then, their armed forces have become largely homogeneous.
1.2.1.2.2.4. Pro: Some armies only conscript men, not women, which shows they are not seen as equally capable.
1.2.1.2.2.4.1. Pro: [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Mexico) conscripts only men.
1.2.1.2.2.4.2. Pro: Conscription in [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Brazil) is only mandatory for men.
1.2.1.2.2.4.3. Con: Given [most countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_military_by_country) allow women to apply for volunteer armies, there is no reason they should be seen as inferior.
1.2.1.2.2.4.4. Con: This is a reason to ensure that all people do their service. It does not mean all service should be abolished.
1.2.1.2.2.4.5. Con: Women are allowed to be conscripted to the military in [nine countries](http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/military-international/), and are actively conscripted in both Eritrea and Israel.
1.2.1.2.2.4.6. Pro: [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Turkey) conscripts only men, not women.
1.2.1.2.2.5. Pro: Since everyone would be serving, the military would reflect the demographic composition of the state, and as such, minority communities would still not see huge representation.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1. Con: Women, for instance, would see much greater representation, as would groups which have traditionally been purged from the ranks such as LGBT peoples. Even if they remain minorities, this is likely to be an improvement on the status quo.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.1. Con: As the total number of conscripts is so much higher, minorities become less noticeable and more easily crowded out. It is thus likely that the voices of minority groups within the military would be even easier to ignore or shut down than before.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Given that minorities are currently underrepresented compared to their societal proportion, the result under conscription could only be an improvement.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: However given that the overall size of the military is smaller, recognizing minorities is easier, even if the proportion of minorities remain the same.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: When there are fewer people serving in the military to keep track of, discrimination against minorities will stand out more and would therefore be more likely to receive attention from the public.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.2. Pro: Because the total number of minorities serving would be higher, they would be more capable of organizing and creating stronger support for minorities.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: It would be easier for minorities to establish official support groups which minority conscripts could seek out to receive help and protection from discrimination within the military.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.3. Pro: As women make up half of the population, they would no longer be minorities within the military if conscription was introduced.
1.2.1.2.2.5.1.4. Con: The lower percentage in numbers combined with the hierarchical structure of the military would make it very hard to introduce reform within the military. As a result, there would just be more individuals in the military who suffer from oppression.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Conscripts are quite young and don't have the depth of experience or knowledge of a community that being an effective officer requires.
1.2.1.4. Pro: This is likely to contribute to a pre-existing trend of militarization of law enforcement in many western countries such as the US.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Many police forces already have tanks and military grade weapons. The deployment of soldiers on the ground to protect communities is likely to feed into the way law enforcement views itself.
1.2.1.5. Pro: With an excess of soldiers, states are likely to deploy them more heavily on their borders.
1.2.1.5.1. Pro: In Israel, conscripted soldiers are used to man [border police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Border_Police) and other domestic roles.
1.2.1.5.2. Pro: Republicans in the US, [on many occasions](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/213085-gop-bill-sends-guard-to-border), have considered sending troops to the border in the status quo.
1.2.1.5.3. Pro: Increasing numbers of military personnel on borders are likely to increase tensions between nations.
1.2.1.5.3.1. Pro: Military build-up on borders is an optically aggressive move which can harm relations between countries.
1.2.1.5.4. Pro: A contentious border staffed with inexperienced 18 year olds is one more likely to see a [skirmish](http://shanghaiist.com/2017/08/16/india-china-border-clash.php) or accident.
1.2.1.5.5. Pro: When there are much greater numbers of people guarding borders, undocumented refugees and migrants are more likely to be turned back.
1.2.1.5.5.1. Pro: These individuals are the most marginalized, often coming from societies where opportunities are extremely limited as a result of the legacies of colonialism and imperialism. It is wrong to deny refuge to these people.
1.2.1.6. Con: The surplus of soldiers could be used for international peacekeeping which would aid in stabilizing currently unstable regions.
1.2.1.7. Pro: If conscripts provide an easy source of manpower, it will be cheaper to cut the size of traditional police forces.
1.2.2. Pro: Having a large base of soldiers available makes states more reckless in times of conflicts.
1.2.2.1. Con: The loss of lives does not become more acceptable just because there are more soldiers, meaning that states have the same incentive to ensure that as few people as possible die during war.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Even if the incentive exists, it does not ensure that the government would not use the influx of soldiers as an opportunity to secure dangerous areas that do not have enough soldiers.
1.2.2.2. Con: The nature of modern warfare has made it such that having a larger number of foot-soldiers does not increase military efficiency or the chances of winning a war.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: [Modern warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_warfare) is typically fought in the form of [proxy wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war), where neither entity directly engages the other. These wars are generally defined as low-intensity conflicts.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: Contemporary warfare is no longer being fought between two opposing masses of soldiers and has instead become to be mostly about concentrated battles between local armed groups and foreign powers, reducing the need for foot soldiers in [war \(p. 963-964\)](https://www.icrc.org/en/download/file/30510/irc_97_900-full.pdf).
1.2.2.2.1.2. Pro: In the modern era, most conscripts are likely to be serving in technical roles behind lines, as intelligence analysts, as drivers for supply convoys, as cooks, or even just dealing with the endless amounts of necessary paperwork.
1.2.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Most roles in the military do not involve front-line positions. The [tooth-to-tail ratio](https://army.ca/forums/index.php?topic=615.0) of a conventional military, is nearly 2:3, not counting research and development positions.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Conscription increases personnel levels, but a militaries strength is much more affected by civilian defence manufacturers.
1.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: The Military Strength Index weights [active personnel at only 5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Military_Strength_Index), whereas tanks \(10%\), attack helicopters \(15%\), aircraft \(20%\), aircraft carriers \(25%\), and submarines \(25%\) contribute much more to the score.
1.2.2.2.2.2. Pro: In fiscal year 2016, the USAs Pentagon issued [$304 billion in contract awards to corporations](https://www.thenation.com/article/heres-where-your-tax-dollars-for-defense-are-really-going/) nearly half of the department’s $600 billion-plus budget for that year.
1.2.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: Lockheed Martin alone has [arms sales of $35,490,000,000 USD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_by_arms_sales), and received nearly 10% of the funds paid out by the Pentagon in [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin). Conscription would mean fewer skilled civilians available, which would hurt this company, and in turn negatively affect many militaries.
1.2.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con: According to [Payscale.com](https://www.payscale.com/data-packages/employee-loyalty/full-list), Lockheed Martin's median age is 34, so conscription targeting 18-19 year olds would have minimal impact.
1.2.2.2.2.2.1.2. Con: Lockheed Martin employs around 100,000 people. About 3.8 million people turned 18 in 2017 out of a total population of 325.7 million, or about 1.17% of the populace. Worst case scenario, this would mean Lockheed Martin would have 1,167 less employees given that they employ around 100,000 people globally. However, Lockheed Martin is made up of about 20% veterans, who would be excluded, so that number would be closer to 933.
1.2.2.2.2.3. Pro: The United States of America is considered the [worlds most powerful military](http://uk.businessinsider.com/most-powerful-militaries-in-the-world-ranked-2018-2/#2-russia-24), but has [only the 7th largest personnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel) \(2,227,200\), with the 6 other largest militaries totalling 33,850,100 personnel.
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: The policy could lead to too large a focus on labour, and not a great enough focus on capital or other military concerns.
1.2.2.2.3.1. Pro: [A study](http://www.ifn.se/Wfiles/conferences/07varnplikt/Poutvaara_Wagener_Conscription.pdf) found that the share of personnel costs in armies under conscription is significantly higher than in all-volunteer armies, despite the below-average salaries received. \(p.7\)
1.2.2.2.4. Con: The role of the military has changed to include more than simply conducting warfare.
1.2.2.2.4.1. Con: The primary mission of the military is to win engagements on the battlefield.  While the military may be used to accomplish tasks beyond "simply conducting warfare", if the military loses on the battlefield, it has failed this primary mission.
1.2.2.2.4.2. Con: The obligatory service in question does not have to be military service.  Non-military services could be used to conduct these news roles, leaving the military as a volunteer service focused on training, preparing for, and fighting in, conflicts.
1.2.2.2.4.3. Pro: The [Swedish Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Armed_Forces) is primarily tasked with supporting international peacekeeping efforts and providing humanitarian aid as Sweden is not currently at war with any other nations.
1.2.2.2.4.4. Pro: The USA launched [Operation Unified Response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unified_Response) to aid in the recovery from the Haiti Earthquake in 2010.
1.2.2.3. Con: Parents have the interests of their children in mind and will vote, lobby, and donate with ardor and zeal if it will keep their family safe.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: Parents may have outdated perspectives on what should be considered toxic cultures within the military and may be dismissive of the need to change anything.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: For various reasons, [older people](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-young-old-politics) are more likely to be conservative.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Armies swollen with conscripts, such as Iran during the Iran-Iraq War and Russia during the World Wars, often choose to use [human wave attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_wave_attack) during battles.
1.2.3. Pro: States are likely to reduce the size of the public service, replacing career public servants with conscripts.
1.2.3.1. Con: Having conscripts work these jobs saves the government a lot of money.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Those job sectors lose out on the expertise of long term workers. A librarian who works in the Library of Congress for twenty years can do the job more effectively than multiple conscripts with little to no experience.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Conscripts know they will only have to work these jobs for two years so they will not try as hard or care as much as career public servants working there for ten years.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Performing well while serving would allow the conscripts to receive good recommendations when applying for future jobs.
1.2.3.4. Con: Frequently refreshing the workforce promotes new ideas, new perspectives, and diversity.
1.2.3.5. Con: Replacing career public servants with conscripts does not reduce the size of the public service. Replacing carpet does not change the square footage of your house.
1.2.4. Con: Politicians want to be re-elected. If they passed laws that allowed the government to deploy troops in a harmful manner, there would be immense [backlash](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/two-days-in-october-student-antiwar-protests-and-backlash/) from their constituents, harming their chances of reelection.
1.2.5. Con: States with a surplus of conscripts will usually find trivial tasks for them to do such as directing traffic at intersections that already have a stop light, telling people to watch their step, etc.
1.3. Con: Militaries are often terrible institutions to work for.
1.3.1. Pro: The military is discriminatory against various minority groups.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Military institutions are very exclusionary to the LGBTQ community.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Homophobia is entrenched in military institutions.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many countries have a long history of banning people from the military based on their sexuality.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The  ['Don't Ask, Don't Tell'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell) policy, which stood until 2011, allowed LGB people to serve in the US military, only if they did not openly reveal their sexuality.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Since the policy was launched in 1994, [13,000 troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell#Discharges_under_DADT) were discharged from the military on the basis of their sexuality.
1.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Many argue that the ban is not based on homophobia, but rather on ['practical' reasons](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703389004575033601528093416) such as unit cohesion, maintaining good order and privacy concerns.
1.3.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If elements of the military believe that unit cohesion and privacy would be negatively affected by including people of non-heterosexual orientations, this is further testament to homophobic justifications for policy.
1.3.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: [Studies show](https://web.archive.org/web/20131206090857/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Military_05_pre.PDF) that there is no strong evidence to support the discriminatory policy and other countries that had lifted their ban had witnessed [no significant negative changes.](http://archive.palmcenter.org/files/FOREIGNMILITARIESPRIMER2010FINAL.pdf) The ban must therefore have been based on something other than evidence and practicality.
1.3.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Up until the year 2000, the British army [banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation_and_military_service) anybody homosexual from serving in the armed forces. It was only through a ruling by the ECHR that this policy was repealed.
1.3.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: There are [45 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation_and_military_service) around the world that still ban homosexuals from serving in the military.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Many LGBTQ+ ex-soldiers have reported the abuse and discrimination that they faced while serving in the military.
1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: A lesbian soldier who served in the US military was awarded [$400,000 in compensation](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1575819/Lesbian-soldier-Kerry-Fletcher-wins-case.html) after enduring lewd advances from a male superior.
1.3.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: [Chelsea Manning](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/04/wikileaks-bradley-manning-bullying), a high profile US gay activist who worked for the military, told people online of the bullying and abuse that she faced due to her sexuality.
1.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: There are [many](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/army-general-says-he-is-planning-to-come-out-im-gay-and-plan-to-fight-military-homophobia-10001742.html) [reports](http://www.truth-out.org/archive/item/85875:resisting-homophobia-in-the-military) of derogatory homophobic language being used against troops.
1.3.1.1.1.4. Con: This may have been true historically, but this was in keeping with greater societal homophobia and transphobia. As society progresses, so will the military's attitude to sexuality and gender.
1.3.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: In 2015, the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force all appeared in [Stonewall's top 100](http://www.stonewall.org.uk/resources/top-100-employers-2015-0) gay-employers of the year.
1.3.1.1.1.4.2. Con: [In 2017](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/25/546216624/trump-signs-memo-implementing-ban-on-transgender-people-in-the-military), US President Donald Trump introduced a policy that banned people who are transgender from serving in the military.
1.3.1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Trump's Transgender ban has been heavily criticized and was condemned by [politicians](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/politicians-respond-donald-trump-transgender-military-ban-article-1.3358240) from both the Democratic and the Republican Parties.
1.3.1.1.1.4.2.2. Con: [Top members](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/346261-military-pushes-back-on-trumps-transgender-ban) of the military are openly opposing President Trump’s move to ban transgender troops, and over 56 retired generals and admirals have spoken out against it.
1.3.1.1.1.4.3. Pro: There is [no longer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation_and_military_service) a ban against people joining the military on the basis of their sexuality in most industrialised liberal democracies.
1.3.1.1.1.4.4. Pro: People who have served in their militaries for many years [speak of](https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canadian-military-shows-tremendous-progress-since-days-of-homophobic-law/article35778547/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&) the progress that they have witnessed.
1.3.1.1.1.4.4.1. Con: The Canadian military may not be a representative case and this kind of progress might be difficult to achieve.
1.3.1.1.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Progress could be particularly difficult to achieve in societies where military culture is prominent.
1.3.1.1.1.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.4.2.
1.3.1.1.1.4.5. Con: The military is a traditional institution whose social outlook progresses at a rate far slower than that of the rest of society.
1.3.1.1.1.4.6. Con: Even if the military is progressing, it is not right to force vulnerable groups to be exposed to this environment while that progress is ongoing.
1.3.1.1.1.4.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Transphobia is entrenched in military institutions.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.4.2.
1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.4.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Racism is entrenched in the military.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The United States military has a history of racial injustice.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: A [study](http://www.newsweek.com/black-troops-study-punishment-622334) found that black service members in the US Army are two times more likely than whites to be punished or face a court martial or other military discipline.
1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: [No African Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_against_African_Americans_in_the_U.S._military) were given the [Medal of Honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor), the United States' highest military decoration for services to the army during World War 2.
1.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: During World War 2, only [five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_against_African_Americans_in_the_U.S._military) officers in the United States Army were African American even though there were over a million serving in the armed forces.
1.3.1.2.1.4. Con: [Executive Order 9981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9981) issued by President Truman officially ended the policy of segregation in the United States Military. Its implementation proves the military has the capacity to change and be more inclusive moving forward.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: The United States Military is battling problems with racial justice in the present day.
1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.1.1.
1.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: A [2017 report](http://www.protectourdefenders.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Report_20.pdf) on the US military stated that the greatest racial disparities in military justice were generally seen for the most serious disciplinary proceedings. In an average year, black Marines were 2.61 times more likely than white Marines to receive a guilty finding at a general court-martial, while they were only 1.29 times more likely than white Marines to receive a guilty finding at an [NJP proceeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment).
1.3.1.2.2.3. Pro: Blacks are denied leadership positions in the military. In 2016, [78%](http://www.newsweek.com/black-troops-study-punishment-622334) of  US military officers were white, while only 8% were black, even though racial minorities make up about [40%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/13/6-facts-about-the-u-s-military-and-its-changing-demographics/) of all service members.
1.3.1.3. Pro: There is entrenched sexism in the military.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: Even insofar as this is true, increasing the representation of women in the military is likely to improve their conditions.
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Women constantly face the threat of sexual assault and workplace harassment while in the military.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: Women have very little recourse against sexual assault.
1.3.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The Pentagon estimates that only [14%](http://www.npr.org/2013/03/20/174756788/off-the-battlefield-military-women-face-risks-from-male-troops) of sexual assaults get reported.
1.3.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: A lot of abusers are protected by the fact that women will not report sexual crimes for fear of being held back in their military careers.
1.3.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Reports say a [third](http://www.protectourdefenders.com/factsheet/) of victims are discharged from the US military within seven months of making a formal report.
1.3.1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Hierarchical military culture makes it difficult for a lot of female soldiers to report sexual assault as their abusers often outrank them.
1.3.1.3.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: [25%](http://www.protectourdefenders.com/factsheet/) of victims who did not report abuse feared retaliation from the chain of command or their coworkers.
1.3.1.3.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: [77%](http://www.protectourdefenders.com/factsheet/) of formal retaliation reports made in the US military in 2016 were against someone in the victim's chain of command.
1.3.1.3.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: When the burden of proof is 'beyond a reasonable doubt', and women accuse an officer who has a long record of positive military service with no prior history, there's a very high chance of acquittal in that situation, irrespective of the officer's guilt.
1.3.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: In [2016](http://www.protectourdefenders.com/factsheet/), in cases where the military could take action, only 13% of perpetrators of sexual crimes were prosecuted and only 4% of offenders were convicted of a sexual crime.
1.3.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: The military's judicial system lacks due process.
1.3.1.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: In most military judicial systems, officers higher up in the chain of command are given convening authority. Ultimately, they make the decision about whether to refer a case to a court-martial or not. There is little power in the hands of the victim.
1.3.1.3.2.1.3.2. Pro: In military judicial systems, officers with convening power can [unilaterally mandate](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/how-the-militarys-bro-culture-turns-women-into-targets/279460/) an administrative response such as a reprimand or counselling to correct the accused's behavior; or preside over a non-judicial punishment hearing in which the commander is the sole decider of facts and punishment, even in cases regarding sexual assault.
1.3.1.3.2.1.3.3. Pro: There are no '[Good Samaritan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritan_law)' laws in most military justice systems, which often [reduces the number of witnesses](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/how-the-militarys-bro-culture-turns-women-into-targets/279460/) who can come forward to defend a victim of abuse.
1.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: According to the Pentagon's [research](http://www.npr.org/2013/03/20/174756788/off-the-battlefield-military-women-face-risks-from-male-troops), women in the military face a higher risk of being raped multiple times.
1.3.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: A report published by NGO Protect our Defenders said that most victims were assaulted more than once, resulting in over [70,000 assaults](http://www.protectourdefenders.com/factsheet/) within the US military in 2016 alone.
1.3.1.3.2.3. Pro: The US Defense Department's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office [stated](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/how-the-militarys-bro-culture-turns-women-into-targets/279460/) that sexism and sexual harassment in the military helps create a "permissive environment" where assaults can occur.
1.3.1.3.2.4. Pro: When polled by the [Veterans Health Administration](https://www.womenshealth.va.gov/WOMENSHEALTH/latestinformation/facts.asp#sthash.), one in five female veterans admitted they had been the victims of Military Sexual Trauma \(MST\).
1.3.1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Sexual assault in the military is a leading cause for female soldiers developing [PTSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder#Trauma).
1.3.1.3.3. Pro: Women have to overcome additional hurdles to get admitted to, and stay in, the military.
1.3.1.3.3.1. Con: Conscription seems like a good way to overcome this. When everyone is forced to serve, the military cannot continue to discriminate in this way.
1.3.1.3.3.1.1. Con: When people are forced to serve, there is no longer any incentive to improve working conditions as a way of maximising recruitment.
1.3.1.3.3.1.2. Con: Everyone being forced to serve just means that higher-ranking officers have a bigger, more diverse pool of soldiers to discipline. It does not cause them to act differently.
1.3.1.3.3.2. Pro: There is an entrenched culture of masculinity in the military which is exclusionary to female members.
1.3.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.2.3.
1.3.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Male military members often have a feeling of entitlement. A common [belief](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/how-the-militarys-bro-culture-turns-women-into-targets/279460/) is that if a woman voluntarily put herself in the company of large groups of men, especially who are on a deployment and so not having easy access to consensual sex, they consent to engaging in sexual relationships with their male counterparts.
1.3.1.3.3.3. Pro: Women are denied leadership positions in the military.
1.3.1.3.3.3.1. Pro: Women are still barred from front-line combat in some countries and are outnumbered in the officer corps in many.
1.3.1.3.3.3.1.1. Pro: In the US military, women make up only [15%](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/how-the-militarys-bro-culture-turns-women-into-targets/279460/) of 1.4 million active-duty service members and only 16 percent of officers are women.
1.3.1.3.3.3.1.2. Pro: As of [2016](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/how-the-militarys-bro-culture-turns-women-into-targets/279460/), of the US military's 38 four-star generals or admirals, just one was a woman.
1.3.1.3.3.3.2. Con: When the proportion of women in the military drastically increases, it will be difficult for this situation to be perpetuated.
1.3.1.3.3.3.2.1. Pro: Statistically, with more women in the military, they are also more likely to be in positions of authority.
1.3.1.3.3.3.2.2. Pro: The military will not be able to hide behind the fact that there are 'fewer women in the military' as a justification for having fewer female officers.
1.3.1.3.4. Con: Sexism is entrenched in almost all professional spheres. This is not exclusive to the military.
1.3.1.3.4.1. Pro: A [gender pay gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap) exists in a lot of countries.
1.3.1.3.4.2. Con: This comparison belies the extent to which the problem exists in the military. Even if it is true that sexism exists elsewhere, it doesn't mean we should force women to be exposed to the worst elements of it against their will.
1.3.1.4. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.3.1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.3.1.
1.3.2. Con: Given that the policy would mean more people would be exposed to what goes on inside the military, there would likely be pressure to change.
1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.
1.3.2.2. Pro: When everyone needs to serve, there will be a strong incentive for individuals to care about the culture of the military because they may have to join.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: Individuals who haven't yet done their mandatory service will be too young to significantly influence the military and its culture.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.
1.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: Their opinions are more likely to be disregarded on the basis of them being children.
1.3.2.2.1.3. Pro: Due to young age, most of these individuals have been unable to accumulate a lot of social and economical capital, making it harder for them to make their voices heard.
1.3.2.2.1.4. Pro: Given that citizens are required to start service at 18, they are unlikely to have the right to vote before they begin. They thus cannot vote on any policies relating to the military prior to their service.
1.3.2.2.1.5. Con: Young people may refuse to serve or strike if they perceive conditions in the military to be terrible for them. From the 1960s to Occupy Wall Street, college age Americans have been at the forefront of every major protest and resistance movement.
1.3.2.2.1.5.1. Pro: In the 1960s for example, massive student protests and clashes with the police at [Kent State](http://www.library.kent.edu/special-collections-and-archives/may-4-chronology) made national headlines and put immense pressure on the Nixon Administration to end the war in Cambodia and Vietnam.
1.3.2.2.1.5.2. Pro: Young people tend not to be as cynical and accustomed to the status quo. Youthfulness is composed of both naivety and energy which pushes college-aged individuals to uniquely identify and stand up against perceived injustice.
1.3.2.2.1.5.3. Con: Those who strike or refuse to serve may be painted as unpatriotic, severely harming the potential efficacy of civil disobedience efforts.
1.3.2.2.1.6. Con: Many people under the age of 18 engage in all sorts of [social justice advocacy](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2016/1/why-does-the-media-ignore-high-school-activism.html) and understand complex issues of discrimination and injustice.
1.3.2.2.1.7. Con: Given that people under 18 will soon be joining the military, they have strong reasons to investigate their future conditions, or talk with their slightly older friends who are already in military service.
1.3.2.3. Pro: The media is likely to focus on the military more when it becomes a more important institution in the country.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: Media attention is a major driver of political change because, broadly speaking, it brings issues to light that might not have otherwise inspired the political will necessary for change.
1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: Since mandatory service means that it is more important to people to know what goes on in the military, journalists have a stronger incentive to more often, and more thoroughly investigate the military.
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Everyone will care about news stories that involve the military because most people will be veterans or know veterans now. This gives the media a big viewership and profit incentive to talk about these issues.
1.3.2.3.3. Con: The media already has a strong focus on the military in the US but it hasn't solved the systemic issues in the military.
1.3.2.4. Con: The problems within the military are inherent to the structural features of any military, so they can never be entirely solved by social pressure.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: Even if it is impossible to completely solve these issues, the impact of the problems caused by these internal structures can be significantly reduced.
1.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: The aggressive and toxic culture of masculinity within the military could be reduced by ensuring that the military personnel in charge of training the recruits have a pedagogical approach that discourages aggressive behavior.
1.3.2.4.1.2. Pro: Spending longer time on physically and mentally preparing conscripts can prevent stressful situations from having a negative impact.
1.3.2.4.1.2.1. Con: If conscripts are only employed for two years, it seems likely that, if anything, the military would invest less time in training them.
1.3.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: The purpose of conscription is to ensure that draftees are better equipped to handle being deployed in times of war. This means that training conscripts to be more durable mentally and physically, is the first priority of the military.
1.3.2.4.1.3. Pro: The military could make officer classes more representative of the general population, so that there are always officers who can be approached to investigate abuses. This would allow the military to more effectively police discrimination and abuse.
1.3.2.4.2. Pro: Top-heavy power dynamics wouldn't change with compulsory service.
1.3.2.4.2.1. Pro: The people within the military with the most power will not lose their position in the military because of conscription and have little incentive to make any changes.
1.3.2.4.2.2. Con: There would be a larger number of people advancing within the military with conscription, as many conscripts might opt to stay in the military even after their mandatory service has ended. This means that there is a larger number of military personnel that could reach top positions in the military.
1.3.2.4.3. Pro: The military requires rigid hierarchical structures because it must operate efficiently under high-pressure situations. This means that abuses of power are possible.
1.3.2.4.3.1. Con: Conscription puts pressure to make sure that high-ranking military personnel do not abuse their power, and that no group of conscripts feel excluded as it would jeopardize the military's ability to operate efficiently.
1.3.2.4.3.2. Pro: The military cannot afford to have well-entrenched mechanisms or expectations of questioning the commands of superiors. This means that officers are likely to either perpetrate abuses themselves, or not investigate abuses that they personally don't care about.
1.3.2.4.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.4.1.3.
1.3.2.4.4. Pro: Because physical force and aggression are such prominent parts of military activities, the military must emphasize masculinity and aggression, which leads to problems of sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.
1.3.2.4.4.1. Con: Soldiers need to be calm and focused in order for military operations to be executed as well as possible. Aggressive behavior is therefore unnecessary and unhelpful for the success of the military.
1.3.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: This proves that attempting to prevent aggressive behavior within the military is not only possible, but also desirable.
1.3.2.4.4.2. Con: The military has a culture of toxic masculinity because it is largely composed of men. If compulsory service causes many women to sign up for military service, it is likely that this culture would change or at least be mitigated.
1.3.2.4.5. Pro: Military service can create a unique set of stresses that people ought not be forced to handle.
1.3.2.4.5.1. Pro: According the US Department of Veteran Affairs, [between](https://medlineplus.gov/magazine/issues/winter09/articles/winter09pg10-14.html) 10% and 30% of returned serving officers suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
1.3.2.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.3.2.4.5.3. Pro: There is an internal stigma against getting treatment for mental illness within the military.
1.3.2.4.5.3.1. Pro: [One study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/when-your-adult-child-breaks-your-heart/201606/military-mental-health) found that more than a third of soldiers thought they might be denied promotions or experience other backlash if they sought mental health treatment.
1.3.2.4.5.3.1.1. Con: Introducing conscription would mean that the problem with the stigma of seeking mental health treatment would be more widely recognized as a serious issue as now more people would face that issue.
1.3.2.4.5.3.2. Pro: Soldiers are routinely [dishonorably discharged](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dishonorable%20discharge) for displaying symptoms of mental illness, and the oversight body charged with re-evaluating these decisions rules in favor of soldiers in less than [4% of cases](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/when-your-adult-child-breaks-your-heart/201606/military-mental-health).
1.3.2.4.5.3.3. Pro: Many Defense Department policies covering job assignments and security clearances still [discriminate](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/05/05/study-slams-pentagon-failing-end-stigma-mental-health-counseling/83922456/) against anyone who receives mental health care.
1.3.2.4.5.3.4. Pro: A 2014 RAND [study](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/05/05/study-slams-pentagon-failing-end-stigma-mental-health-counseling/83922456/) identified 203 Pentagon policies that may contribute to stigma and need to be reviewed, but nothing has been done about them, in part, because they are not a big enough priority for the Pentagon.
1.3.2.4.5.3.5. Con: For those who are only in the military due to compulsory service, there won't be a fear of diminished promotions or discharge so they are likely to seek this treatment if they need it.
1.3.2.4.5.4. Con: People who choose to serve in the military are by extension also consenting to the possible exposure of stressful situations.
1.3.2.4.5.5. Pro: A [study](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/03/health/jama-military-mental-health/index.html) found that the rate of major depression is five times as high among soldiers as civilians; intermittent explosive disorder, which results in episodes of extreme anger, is six times as high; and post-traumatic stress disorder was nearly fifteen times higher than among civilians.
1.3.2.4.5.6. Pro: As a soldier you could be forced to do and see things against your better judgement and would have to live with the consequences of those actions.
1.3.2.4.5.6.1. Pro: Soldiers may be forced to kill others, watch their friends be injured or killed, face a near-constant threat of death or torture and see others take actions that undermine their own principles.
1.3.2.4.5.7. Pro: A survey found almost [25%](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/03/health/jama-military-mental-health/index.html) of nearly 5,500 active-duty, non-deployed Army soldiers surveyed tested positive for a mental disorder of some kind, and 11% within that subgroup also tested positive for more than one illness.
1.3.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.3.3. Con: Militaries maintain the sovereignty of a nation and must be maintained whether they provide a pleasant work environment or not. Therefore, obligatory service should be maintained even if the military is a terrible institution to work for.
1.3.3.1. Con: Most nations do not have [conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription) yet still do not have any problems maintaining sovereignty.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: A purely volunteer force is not always sufficient. Therefore, if there is a country without obligatory service, it should introduce obligatory service so as to ensure that the nation can defend itself. Even during peace, even [the U.S. has drafted men](http://www.historylink.org/File/5572) for service despite having a large volunteer force.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: All sovereignty is maintained by military force whether it is the military of the nation in question or the military of that nation's allies. Many states that have "abolished" conscription still reserve the [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription) to resume it. Therefore, conscription has not actually been abolished, it's simply not active.
1.3.4. Pro: Conscripted soldiers are treated badly and underpaid.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Salaries under conscription are often far lower than minimum wage, and certainly lower than for career officers. This is because it is [too expensive](https://www.studentsforliberty.org/2016/12/28/israel-doesnt-need-conscription/) to sufficiently pay the soldiers.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Israeli combat soldiers \(who are paid more than non-combat soldiers\) earn only [282 dollars a month](https://www.timesofisrael.com/government-raises-idf-soldiers-pay/). In other words, just above 9 dollars a day. This is vastly insufficient for a living wage.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: The salary for conscripted members of the Israeli military \(IDF\) has only recently been [increased by 50%](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-combat-soldiers-to-get-50-raise-to-half-of-minimum-wage/), yet it is still only half of the minimum wage.
1.3.4.1.3. Pro: Immigrants, minorities and citizens with poor backgrounds are often pushed to make [economic desertions](https://972mag.com/poverty-in-the-idf-thousands-jailed-for-financially-motivated-desertion/77588/). This has led to thousands of soldiers being jailed in Israel.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Minimum wage in South Korea was about $5.15 in 2015. The wages of conscripted soldiers were [far lower](http://unkantelope.com/wordpress_antelope/2015/05/06/required-military-service-in-korea-has-controversy/) than minimum wage since a Private got $120, a Private First Class got $130, a Corporal got $143 and a Sergeant got $159 every month.
1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.4.5.
1.3.6. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.4. Pro: Obligatory military service or volunteer work is a more fair and equal way to distribute the responsibilities of society across all of its members - more so even than taxes.
1.4.1. Con: Whether conscription or taxes are more fair depends on the specific details of each policy. It's impossible to justify the fairness without more detail.
1.4.1.1. Con: The policies of obligatory community/military service are outlined in the introduction to this conversation.
1.4.2. Pro: Everyone can offer up a \(roughly\) equal amount of time and effort, and so everyone can contribute \(roughly\) equal amounts through military service. By contrast, the ability of people to contribute to society through mechanisms like taxation is unequal across different income groups.
1.4.2.1. Con: It's not a problem for a society to have varying levels of contribution, as long as everyone contributes positively not negatively.
1.4.3. Con: Redistribution through taxation is more fair in principle because through taxation individuals contribute to society in proportion to the advantages they have within it. Conversely, giving up a year of employment/training may be especially costly for the less advantaged members of society.
1.5. Con: While every country should have obligatory military service, not every country should draft every civilian. The number of citizens called up and the length of term should be set solely based on the security needs of the country. The only reason to draft everyone is if the nation cannot meet those needs even with every civilian.
1.5.1. Con: The security needs of a country can change quickly and dramatically.
1.5.2. Con: Even if the security needs of the country are met without requiring all citizens to be a part of the military, there are other areas where community service is needed, such as education, \(re\)building community spaces and parks and caring for the elderly citizens.
1.5.3. Pro: Keeping people in military/community service longer than their service is needed and used would decrease their motivation and willingness to be hardworking after they return to their everyday jobs.
1.6. Con: This policy is a waste of resources.
1.6.1. Con: With conscription, that added waste is outweighed by improved troop mobility, military policy, more highly specialized citizens, etc.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Obligatory two-year service would guarantee that young adults get important work-experience which they can then later apply in life.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Compulsory service usually entails a basic training component. This teaches valuable skills such as basic first aid and self-defence training.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Both of these are also available to civilians
1.6.1.1.2. Con: Multiple studies have found that being conscripted negatively affects your lifetime earnings compared with non-conscripts.
1.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: [A study](http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~hmlien/pfinance/pf1/readings/draft.pdf) found that draftees in the Vietnam War earned less for the rest of their lives than people who served voluntarily. Bearing in mind there was a draft lottery for US draftees in Vietnam, this may be more than correlative.
1.6.1.1.2.2. Pro: [A study](http://www.ifn.se/Wfiles/conferences/07varnplikt/Poutvaara_Wagener_Conscription.pdf) found that Dutch draftees suffered losses of up to 5 percent of lifetime earnings compared to non-conscripts. \(p.9\)
1.6.1.1.3. Con: Many people would be assigned jobs which have no relevance for those people once their service is finished.
1.6.1.1.3.1. Con: Many people could gain practical experience in fields of interest, or that they are already innately skilled in, that provide them a resume for a job outside of the military. The military already employs engineers, mechanics, scientists, etc.
1.6.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: This can make practical experience into a more important factor when applying for a job within their field of interest.
1.6.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Because students normally do not get practical experience before their university degree is completed, getting a job within their field of interest is primarily dependent on their theoretical qualifications, not their practical ability to perform the job they're applying for.
1.6.1.1.4. Pro: For those in military service, it would be particularly beneficial as they would have experience in the highly disciplined environment of the military.
1.6.1.1.4.1. Pro: Militaries have well-established methods of ensuring discipline and obedience.
1.6.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The [methods](http://vfpuk.org/2016/military-training-obey-hate-kill/) used by the military of instilling obedience tend to be harmful to the mental health of those serving.
1.6.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The military actively seeks to quash [individualism](http://sites.psu.edu/aspsy/2015/02/27/social-identity-in-the-military/) and free thought within recruits. These are values which are critical to solve many contemporary social issues.
1.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: In [South Korea](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140409000974), military ideology has seeped into many parts of Korean society ranging from the corporate sector to academia, and even in athletic fields, as men, who completed their mandatory military service, climb up the social ladder. Thus, individual identities are stifled even after leaving the military.
1.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Order and cooperative, collective action are not necessarily contradictory to individual autonomy. 
Attribution of the desire to quash individualism here is potentially confounded with social engineering initiatives, overreaching government, and other forces not inherent to the military.
1.6.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Training regimes instill discipline through tough programs and grueling days of exercise and hard work.
1.6.1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Militaries use various [marching formations](http://www.mcrdsd.marines.mil/News/News-Article-Display/Article/529647/close-order-drill-instills-discipline-obedience/) and [physical training exercises](http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2013/03/05/why_is_boot_camp_so_intense.html) to instill instant obedience to orders.
1.6.1.1.4.1.3. Pro: Insubordination in the military is often met with serious punishment. It is unlikely that recruits would make this mistake twice.
1.6.1.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Serious punishment has been phased out of military service. Gone are the days where having soldiers do 100 push-ups to correct mistakes. Now it is paper-work punishments. Having soldiers do extended hours of work for reduced rank and half pay.
1.6.1.1.4.1.4. Pro: Serving in the military means preparing for military warfare which can be very demanding both physically and mentally. Soldiers need to be well-disciplined and obedient in order to be prepared for strenuous situations during warfare.
1.6.1.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.4.1.2.
1.6.1.1.5. Con: If everyone is getting this work experience then it does not actually provide any comparative advantage to the people who have it.
1.6.1.1.5.1. Con: Getting work experience helps young adults to learn how to perform work on a routine basis.
1.6.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: This experience is more meaningful than having a more fleshed out CV.
1.6.1.1.6. Con: It is unlikely that this work experience would be better than they could gain pursuing their own interests over the two years.
1.6.1.1.6.1. Pro: Without compulsory service, this period would be likely invested in an area that was actually of interest to the individual and could thus be applied later.
1.6.1.1.6.1.1. Con: It is likely that most young adults are incapable of properly investing their time appropriately.
1.6.1.1.6.1.1.1. Con: They are probably better at making this evaluation than a one size fits all approach from the government.
1.6.1.1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: While individual youths may be better at making this evaluation themselves, the risk is that they lack the necessary discipline needed to do in practice what they know they should do in theory. Mandatory service will ensure that this is discipline is learned by those who serve.
1.6.1.1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Few young adults [know](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/what-career-do-teens-want-i-dont-know-many-say-8C11129187) what they want and even fewer know how to pursue what they want.
1.6.1.1.6.1.1.3. Pro: Many young adults may lack proper motivation to fully pursue meaningful experiences in their own life.
1.6.1.1.6.1.1.3.1. Pro: Young adults who live at home have no necessity to live responsibly. This means that doing fun activities such as playing video games or socializing with peers of their age may appear more enticing.
1.6.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: If they enjoy the work they are doing, the benefits are also likely to be maximised as they will be keen to learn as much as possible.
1.6.1.1.6.2. Con: There are no guarantees that pursuing one's own interests will grant any meaningful experience. Getting paid for doing work is a meaningful experience in itself.
1.6.1.1.7. Pro: Military service training emphasizes the building of soft skills such as teamwork, responsibility, stress management and awareness.
1.6.1.1.7.1. Con: The nature of the military is inherently violent which promotes violent stereotypes among those who serve.
1.6.1.1.8. Pro: It could be the stepping stone for any young person who has not yet figured out what they want to do with their lives after high school.
1.6.1.1.9. Pro: Evidence [from Israel](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/israel/2017-04-19/how-israeli-conscription-drives-innovation) indicates that conscription cultivates skills which help conscripts succeed in education and the job market.
1.6.1.1.9.1. Con: A surplus of workers is common in the [Israeli military](https://www.studentsforliberty.org/2016/12/28/israel-doesnt-need-conscription/) and there are many cases of conscripted soldiers having practically nothing to do.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Many politicians would have their children in the military and as such, would be incentivized to create better military policy.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: It is more likely that the politicians would attempt to find ways to get their children exempt from the military.
1.6.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.1.
1.6.1.2.1.2. Con: Politicians lead public lives. If they were getting false exemptions for their children, this would likely be noticed by the public and they would be held accountable for it.
1.6.1.2.2. Con: Politicians would probably be able to secure privileged positions for their children within the military, and so would not be incentivised to engineer wider reforms.
1.6.1.2.3. Con: The children of politicians would be unlikely to suffer from many of the problems in the military; for example, since they are presumably more wealthy than average, they would not worry so much about being underpaid.
1.6.1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.6.2. Pro: Government money is better spent on welfare or redistribution programs as opposed to the military.
1.6.2.1. Pro: These programs target the people who need help the most.
1.6.2.2. Pro: Welfare programs are often threatened with cuts because of increasing budget deficits in these countries.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: In the United States, House Republicans are considering making [large cuts](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/14/republicans-cuts-programs-food-stamps-welfare-veterans-238314) to food stamps, welfare, and income assistance for the disabled.
1.6.2.3. Con: Obligatory service doesn't necessitate increased military budget.
1.6.2.4. Con: This policy effectively acts as a form of welfare: it gives all citizens a wage for two years in addition to skills they can use later in life.
1.6.2.4.1. Con: Social welfare should be unconditional. It is immoral to force people to do something against their wishes, putting their lives and safety on the line, just to get welfare.
1.6.2.4.1.1. Con: Depending on the military, dying violently while performing duties is less likely than dying in a car accident on the way to said duties.
1.6.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: There is no reason why the military would expose conscripts to significant dangers during service as incidents harming individuals would make the military look bad.
1.6.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Any death or injury looks bad for the military so there is already an incentive to minimise risks for their personnel. The fact that so many soldiers are harmed anyway suggests these risks are inherent.
1.6.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The possibility of ending up in warzones means that the risk of death or permanent injury is inherently more likely in the military.
1.6.2.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the Iraq war alone, there were [almost](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1176276) 37,000 US casualties.
1.6.2.4.2. Pro: In addition, there is a return to the government in the form of work.
1.6.3. Pro: Many countries already have adequate militaries, and this would divert resources from more productive endeavors.
1.6.4. Pro: This service would restrict their ability to move on to alternative pathways such as vocational work or higher education.
1.6.4.1. Con: Having fewer people pursuing higher education may be a good thing as many countries are experiencing [academic inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credentialism_and_educational_inflation), which causes problems for the job market.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: [Academic inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credentialism_and_educational_inflation) means that there is an inflation of the minimum credentials required for a given job, and the simultaneous devaluation of the value of diplomas and degrees. This means a lot of people will have to spend a lot of effort and resources to get degrees that shouldn't be necessary to get the jobs they want.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: Academic degrees are socially costly because of the years of lost productivity required to acquire them. The proliferation of academic degrees therefore creates social costs.
1.6.4.2. Con: This policy would provide life experience necessary for people to better determine their career interests. Therefore, they would have a better chance of finding a successful major at university.
1.6.4.3. Pro: The enforced gap between finishing school and continuing further education may reflect negatively in people's academic performance on return to education.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: If people take a break of several years between high school and university, they may find it difficult to retain facts, forget what they had learned and struggle to replicate study habits they knew in high school.
1.6.4.3.1.1. Con: School systems would likely adapt to these circumstances as everyone has to do service and would ensure that there is a reintroduction period for returning students.
1.6.4.3.1.1.1. Con: This would still mean that there is an added burden of having to put effort on relearning these things due to the long break.
1.6.4.3.1.1.2. Con: School systems can't do much to help students reenter good study habits as that is something that the students develop and maintain personally.
1.6.4.4. Pro: [A study](https://izajole.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40172-015-0026-4) found that conscription decreased the proportion of Dutch university graduates by 1.5 percentage points and reduces the likelihood of obtaining a university degree by almost four percentage points.
1.6.4.4.1. Con: The fact that fewer conscripts go on to higher education might indicate that the experience and education gained from conscription are a substitute for other forms of education, in which case this is not a bad thing.
1.6.4.5. Pro: This would place the country at a comparative disadvantage as their workforce would be getting educated on average two years later.
1.6.4.5.1. Pro: This obligated work prevents industrious youth from creating their own institutions while they are still ambitious and idealistic.
1.6.4.6. Con: They would be able to pursue these pathways at the end of their service.
1.6.4.6.1. Con: Some people may find it very difficult to return to study and no steady income after two years of paid work.
1.6.4.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.3.1.
1.6.4.6.2. Pro: They would likely be better positioned to pursue these pathways as they will have matured significantly from serving their country for two years.
1.6.4.6.2.1. Pro: Performing community/military service provides benefits for the individuals who participate.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: Service will ensure that young people interact with a greater diversity of other people.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.1. Con: People often do have the chance to interact with a great diversity of people in life but often choose to form and stay within social groups containing similar people. [Studies \(p. 19, 21-22\)](https://books.google.se/books?hl=sv&lr=&id=OC84AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA17&dq=staying+in+social+group&ots=GZ2VkoV1_5&sig=kGk6DY9a83WoiMGwdOAa8te-tEw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=true) suggest that the relationship between social status and isolated behavior only increases with age, implying that people would just form new, similar social groups to the ones they were in before serving.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The structure of the military where recruits are placed in divisions means that it will often be impossible to form these social groups while serving.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.2. Con: It would be more reasonable and efficient for people to provide service in their local area. Considering this, they would not be exposed to more diversity than they would face in primary or secondary schools.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.3. Pro: At school, many students will not be exposed to a wide variety of different people due to the small size of their environment.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: [Tracking programs](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/11/modern-day-segregation-in-public-schools/382846/) within schools often single out minorities and put them into separate lower-level classes.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: Minority groups tend to be concentrated in certain areas for a multitude of reasons, meaning that public schools are often not very diverse.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Redlining has historically pushed minority groups into certain neighborhoods.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Gentrification often pushes low-income minorities out of once diverse neighborhoods.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.3.3. Pro: This is particularly true for those who attend schools with restrictive intake \(religious schools, single-sex schools, privately owned schools\).
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.4. Pro: This exposure gives the opportunity to work with different people on an equal playing field which may help later in life when one has to work for, or be in charge of, someone from a different background.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.5. Con: This could be harmful: if people do not enjoy the work they are forced to do, they might negatively associate this with this exposure.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.5.1. Con: The fact that the job may not be enjoyable could serve as common ground between different types of individuals to bond over their shared hardship.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.5.1.1. Con: If we recognise that the policy is going to cause shared suffering then that is a sufficient reason to not implement it.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Shared suffering and hardship are features of poverty and oppression, but these aren't good reasons to maintain those conditions.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.5.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.5.1.1.3. Con: The reason why serving may not be enjoyable is because it's tough and challenging. While conscription may not be enjoyable, that does not mean that it would cause suffering significant enough to not implement the policy.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.5.1.1.4. Con: Tasks that aren't enjoyable but very important and beneficial, such as cleaning and working out should not be classified as causing suffering.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.6. Con: There is no reason they could not gain this experience in pursuing their own desires.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.6.1. Con: The communities that individuals are from can often act as bubbles and deny them meaningful exposure to other groups of people.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.6.1.1. Con: These bubbles can prevent individuals from meaningfully interact with other groups of people in the military as well.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: In Israel, units have historically been divided by [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracal_Battalion) and [ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Battalion), preventing meaningful contact in many cases.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Individuals' time during service would be spent in close proximity to other individuals of varying backgrounds and social groups. Spending their time working, eating, and sleeping together provides an unique exposure that forces them to leave their bubbles.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.6.2. Con: The individuals most likely to benefit from serving in communities of color are those with racist and problematic biases and beliefs. These are the individuals least likely to go and work in these communities on their own initiative.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: It is hard for racist stereotypes and notions to continue to persist when individuals meet real people of color and live in these communities.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.6.2.2. Pro: If an individual believes \(consciously or subconsciously\) that black people are dangerous, for example, there is very little incentive to live or work in one of these communities.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.6.3. Pro: College campuses are often quite diverse and places where individuals learn about other types of people.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.6.3.1. Pro: Unlike schools, the size of colleges means that a larger cross-section of society is likely to be represented.
1.6.4.6.2.1.1.6.3.2. Con: College is inherently more elite than school as it is selective. If anything it is less diverse than school.
1.6.4.6.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.3.
1.6.4.6.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.6.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.6.4.6.2.1.4. Con: Mandatory community service will cause young people to resent it, and avoid volunteer work later in life.
1.6.4.6.2.1.5. Con: If someone thinks they would benefit from service, they can volunteer on their own time.
1.6.4.6.2.1.6. Pro: Military conscription teaches young men and women loyalty, self-assurance, a sense of belonging, and above all discipline; these things being extremely lacking in societies such as in the US today because of government interference in our personal lives.
1.6.4.6.2.1.7. Pro: If the military service is structured so that it promotes helping the community and not just defense, then it could influence people's behaviors for the better for the rest of their lives.
1.6.4.6.2.1.8. Pro: During times of economic instability or high levels of unemployment, such a system would economically support those who are part of the program, and potentially their families.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9. Con: Forced service can be very harmful to unwilling workers.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.1. Pro: Many peoples' lives would be disrupted by having to serve and [implications](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11612488/It-would-be-a-terrible-idea-to-bring-back-National-Service-and-heres-why.html) can include having to abandon jobs or breaking up relationships.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.1.1. Con: Most people would probably plan ahead knowing that they have required service at 18.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.1.1.1. Con: There are many situations in which it is impossible for people to plan their lives around two years of being absent from their normal life.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: Young people still risk losing out on big job opportunities that will not wait for them to do their two year service. A company seeking new employees would need to hire a replacement if an employee/prospective employee would be unavailable for two years.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is unclear who they lose out to in this situation as all their peers would be in the same situation. These companies would likely just employ people out of the military.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Companies looking for employees are unlikely to just target a narrow age group. This means that they would likely hire applicants who've already done their service.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.1.1.1.2. Pro: Sustaining a long-distance relationship for two years is very difficult and it is likely that many would not be able to manage a long-distance relationship.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2. Pro: Some people will struggle to cope with their life in service. These people will likely be too unhappy to see any benefits from any character-building moments.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2.1. Pro: Suicide rates in the military are much higher than other populations.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2.1.1. Con: Those with histories of depression and mental health problems, or those who develop them over the course of service, would likely be granted exemptions. This may not solve the problem, but it will likely make it less severe.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.4.5.3.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2.1.2. Pro: [Scientists](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/06/12/military-suicide-rates/85287518/) still don't know exactly why suicides increased so dramatically in the military. Major studies have shown no direct link between the deaths and being deployed overseas, and suicide increased even among soldiers who did not deploy.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2.1.2.1. Pro: It therefore difficult to effectively introduce policies that reduce suicide rates as cause is uncertain. This makes it particularly reckless to introduce conscription when suicide rates are unlikely to go down.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2.1.4. Con: As the [article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/06/12/military-suicide-rates/85287518/) states: "The sharp rise in the Army's suicide rate ... coincided with unusually heavy demands on the nation's all-volunteer military.". A larger pool of people to choose from for combat and support roles, might reduce that rate by allowing the screening of unfit individuals and giving them a role in the military that they are able to handle.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2.2. Con: Character-building moments are often ones that are unpleasant and uncomfortable.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2.2.1. Pro: Unpleasant moments are often times when individuals make mistakes or get themselves into a bad situation - these are important learning experiences.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2.3. Con: As conscription is established, being forced to perform obligatory service becomes normalized. This means that most people would accept the fact that they have to do service, just like everyone else.
1.6.4.6.2.1.9.2.3.1. Con: The human mind and cultures can normalize virtually any situation. This claim as evidence is useless as it could be used to justify anything for any purpose. The question at hand is "What should be so" which should account for cultural norms but seeks an ideal state.
1.6.4.6.2.1.10. Pro: Earning wages from being a productive worker provides people with a sense of dignity and self-accomplishment.
1.6.4.6.2.1.10.1. Con: Not if the wage in question is barely enough to live on and in no relation to the work that's being done.
1.6.4.6.2.1.11. Pro: Doing two years of obligatory service teaches young adults how to be independent and responsible for their own living situation.
1.6.4.6.2.1.11.1. Con: College and other forms of higher education do the same, as does having a typical job. So at best, this is not unique to conscription.
1.6.4.6.2.1.11.1.1. Con: Far from everyone in society attends college or other forms of higher education.
1.6.4.6.2.1.11.2. Pro: Conscription pushes those who serve to maintain good health and hygiene.
1.6.4.6.2.1.11.2.1. Pro: There is normally no established pressure put on young adults to maintain good health and hygiene by schools when attending higher education.
1.6.4.6.2.1.11.2.2. Con: Participating in war isn't very good for one's personal health.
1.6.4.6.2.1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.4.
1.6.4.6.2.1.11.4. Con: Serving in the military doesn't teach anyone how to be independent; it teaches them to follow orders. It doesn't prepare you for making your own decisions.
1.6.4.6.2.1.12. Con: Military conscripts often find themselves without any significant tasks to do.
1.6.4.6.2.1.12.1. Pro: For [German conscripts](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/killing-time-for-conscripts-german-military-service-is-battle-against-boredom-a-702665.html), military service is often a battle against boredom.
1.6.4.6.2.1.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.9.1.
1.6.4.6.2.1.12.3. Pro: If conscripts feel like they aren't doing anything useful, resentment against their forced conscription will increase.
1.6.4.6.2.1.13. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.6.4.7. Con: The US military offers free training to all who enlist as well as [college reimbursement assistance](http://www.military.com/education/money-for-school/tuition-assistance-ta-program-overview.html).
1.6.4.7.1. Pro: If a family cannot afford to send their child to college the draft will provide them with the very chance to fulfill their goals of becoming what they always hope to achieve as a career. Poor families should view enlistment as a way to uplift their family status in society while serving their nation.
1.6.4.7.2. Con: There is no reason why a poor individual cannot voluntarily sign up under the status quo. This is not a reason to force everyone to do this.
1.6.4.7.3. Con: It seems unlikely that the military would continue to offer this assistance if everyone were conscripted as this would effectively require the government to fully fund university for all.
1.6.4.8. Con: The proposal allows for non-military forms of service, which would allow for such pathways.
1.6.5. Con: Obligatory service is only a waste of resources if the government drafts more workers than necessary and/or forces them to serve for longer than necessary. The U.S. has [obligatory service](http://www.historylink.org/File/5572) but only [drafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States#Conscription_controversies_since_2003) a small number of people and therefore doesn't waste resources.
1.6.6. Pro: Obligatory service is only useful in nations that do not have the resources to produce a large enough volunteer force to deter against enemies \(e.g. Israel\).
1.6.7. Pro: The UK struggles to fill many important jobs, in [specialist/high demand sectors](http://www.visabureau.com/uk/shortage-occupations-list.aspx). With conscription, that problem would worsen.
1.6.8. Pro: If a person wants to work for community, but needs higher education to do so \(teachers, doctors\), delaying him from learning via obligatory service is harmful to the society.
1.6.9. Pro: Such a system would be costly to maintain, because the military would be required to either house or feed the soldiers, sailors and airmen or pay them a stipend so they could feed and house themselves.
1.6.10. Pro: It is impossible to effectively utilize all people of age 18-20 for military/community service.
1.6.10.1. Pro: Jobs would have to be created just to ensure that everyone has work to do. It is unlikely that all jobs would be useful.
1.6.10.1.1. Con: The government would simply have the freedom to offer public services that have previously been deemed [too expensive](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/opinion/lets-draft-our-kids.html), such as providing universal free daycare or aiding the elderly overcome loneliness.
1.6.10.1.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that parents would be willing to leave their children in the hands of 18-20 year olds who would prefer not to be there.
1.6.10.1.1.1.1. Con: Considering that there is some degree of choice involved for those performing mandatory service and that there would be training before they'd be allowed to work, the community workers would likely be sufficiently reliable.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2. Pro: People who do not want to do military or community service are unreliable as workers.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Plenty of people are employed in jobs they do not want or enjoy, but perform adequately.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Adequate job performance is not sufficient in the military; even when people perform their job perfectly there is still a risk of others dying. Perfect or above average job performance is only possible when people enjoy their job.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The desire to survive and make sure that fellow soldiers are safe, is a strong enough incentive to ensure that workers will be motivated to do their utmost when in the military.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Serving together in the same unit requires good coordination and cooperation between the soldiers. It is likely that soldiers establish strong bonds of friendship due to this which leads them to care about each other's safety.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Many may not want to do their obligatory service because they conscientiously object to forced labor. These people would be unlikely to perform any tasks adequately.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: People involuntarily serving in the military would be a liability in high-stake situations.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: When faced with confronting situations, it is unlikely that an unwilling recruit would be willing to make a personal sacrifice for the greater good.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: Self-selection of jobs allows for improved [personality-job fits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality%E2%80%93job_fit_theory), which affects how well an individual does at a given job. Conscription does not allow for this freedom of self-selection, thereby resulting in poor personality-job fits which produce workers with low performance levels.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: This is true only to the extent that people can self-select effectively. Conscription would allow for use of a [sophisticated personality assessmen](http://www.army-technology.com/features/featurewhat-it-takes-could-personality-tests-make-the-military-more-effective-4809788/)t, to more effectively place people according to their personality-job fit.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.3.2. Con: Self-selection means that only people with a small range of personalities enter the military. Conscription ensures that the military can access a wider pool of personality types, which makes it easier to enable personality-job fits.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.4.1.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.5. Pro: [Unlike voluntary soldiers](http://connectusfund.org/10-meaningful-pros-and-cons-of-mandatory-military-service) who are willing to undergo rigorous training and serve the country, draft soldiers often lack the necessary experience and preparedness, providing low combat skill quality when the time comes they are sent to war.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.5.1. Con: There are many other military jobs that do not go into combat and are easily replaced after a short service.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.5.2. Pro: Militaries have little incentive to spend months training their soldiers when they will stop serving in two years.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.5.2.1. Con: The incentive is that if these soldiers are required for combat then their poor training would likely cost victory.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.6. Pro: People serving in the military against their will are likely to disrespect authority.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.6.1. Con: Even if this is initially true, it is likely that this will change after a brief stint in the military.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.4.1.3.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.5.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.6.3. Pro: Many soldiers, especially those of minority background, may perceive their forced service as a form of marginalization. These soldiers are unlikely to obey or find legitimate the orders of a perceived oppressor state.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.6.3.1. Pro: Many [ethnic and religious minorities](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/israel-druze-conscientious-objectors-201417124820876902.html) in Israel, for example, resent the Israeli state for forcing them to serve. These groups include in the Druze and male Ultra-Orthodox.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.7. Pro: Unwilling workers aren't sufficiently motivated to perform their duties effectively.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.7.1. Pro: Modest wages are not sufficient to motivate workers to be productive at a job they do not like.
1.6.10.1.1.1.2.8. Pro: It is difficult enough to ensure that voluntary military/community service members are reliable, ensuring that involuntary workers will be reliable will be even more difficult.
1.6.10.1.1.2. Con: Social programs and policies that are unpopular in the status quo are unlikely to grow more popular when there is conscription.
1.6.10.1.1.2.1. Con: The effects of social labor would be both large and visible shortly after the policy has been implemented since the number of workers would be so large. This means that the social work done by conscripts would likely become very positively perceived by people.
1.6.10.1.1.2.2. Con: It seems as plausible that these programs would be popular as it is for conscription itself to be brought in.
1.6.10.1.1.2.3. Pro: It is unlikely that the willingness of lawmakers to fund these programs will change purely because of conscription.
1.6.10.1.1.3. Pro: Lots of community service and charity programs simply do not have the necessary manpower in the status quo to run the number of soup kitchens, community centers, and targeted programs at low income housing, for example, to reach everyone who needs help.
1.6.10.1.2. Pro: In staffing jobs that do not need to be done, the country would face diminished productivity as these people would not actually be contributing in a meaningful way.
1.6.10.1.2.1. Con: The global youth unemployment rate for people between 15-29 in 2017 stands at [13.1%](http://www.un.org/youthenvoy/2016/08/global-youth-unemployment-rise/), meaning 71 million young people are jobless. This policy would therefore improve these individuals' economic earnings and contributions.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1. Con: [54 million](http://www.un.org/youthenvoy/2016/08/global-youth-unemployment-rise/) of these people are in 'emerging countries'. It could potentially harm the further development of these countries if they prioritised building their military over investing in the education of their youth.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Mandatory service should be considered as a unique form of education that is invested in the youth which cannot be gained elsewhere.
1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.6.2.1.
1.6.10.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.6.2.1.12.
1.6.10.2. Pro: In the US alone, there is an [average of 4 million](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf) people who turn 18 annually. This means 8 million people would have to be given full-time jobs at any given time.
1.6.10.2.1. Con: There are [organizations](https://skift.com/2017/02/02/tsa-is-still-understaffed-and-cant-hire-new-officers-after-trump-orders/) that are very understaffed and therefore inefficient. It is possible that some people would have new jobs created for them, but most people would fill up pre-existing positions.
1.6.11. Pro: At a time when most liberal democracies are not engaged in or threatened by warfare, increasing military resources in these countries is nonsensical.
1.6.11.1. Pro: There are many dangers in society that constitute a much higher threat to citizens than warfare.
1.6.11.1.1. Pro: There are 5 [deaths](http://www.who.int/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf) for every 100,000 people as a result of conflict and war in the world. In comparison, there are 279 deaths per 100,000 people caused by cardiovascular diseases and 211 deaths per 100,000 people caused by infectious and parasitic diseases.
1.6.11.2. Pro: A lot of countries have been cutting their military expenditure in recent years, which suggests that their size is not of paramount importance to the well-being of these countries.
1.6.11.2.1. Pro: The number of soldiers in the British army has been [steadily declining](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39968776) over [recent years](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33638492), as 'the Army has enough personnel to meets its commitments'.
1.6.11.2.2. Con: [Estonia](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-estonia-budget/estonia-passes-2017-record-level-budget-spending-to-bolster-defense-idUSKBN14824W) passed 2017 record level budget spending to bolster their military defense.
1.6.11.2.3. Con: [Expenditure](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2017/world-military-spending-increases-usa-and-europe) on military has increased across the world recently.
1.6.11.2.4. Pro: In 2016, Italy cut its military expenditure [by 16%.](http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/articles/article.html/1fb0e237-d0e6-40f6-8de1-27e47b00df01/pdf)
1.6.11.2.5. Pro: In 2016, the US military expenditure fell [by 4.8%.](http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/articles/article.html/1fb0e237-d0e6-40f6-8de1-27e47b00df01/pdf)
1.6.11.2.5.1. Con: Between 2017 and 2019, the US defense budget will have [increased 17.4 percent](http://fortune.com/2018/02/12/trump-military-budget/) in nominal terms.
1.6.11.2.6. Con: Sweden recently decided to bring back [conscription](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-military-budget-increase-russia-tensions-nato-baltics-draft-reintroduced-a7904011.html) and to increase military spending. This was desired by 72% of Swedish citizens according to [surveys](https://www.thelocal.se/20160104/swedes-tell-poll-bring-back-military-service) done prior to the decision.
1.6.11.2.6.1. Con: Sweden's decision is [apparently](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-military-budget-increase-russia-tensions-nato-baltics-draft-reintroduced-a7904011.html) motivated by security concerns rather than an inherent love of conscription.
1.6.11.3. Con: [Eight of the NATO](http://www.ifn.se/Wfiles/conferences/07varnplikt/Poutvaara_Wagener_Conscription.pdf) members still have conscription.
1.6.11.4. Con: Recent [Russian aggression](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/03/sweden-conscription/518571/) in Crimea has led to increased uncertainty in the Northern European region.
1.6.11.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.11.2.6.
1.6.11.5. Pro: The number of wars, and the number of casualties from wars, have [declined steeply](https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace/) and are at their lowest point in history.
1.6.11.6. Con: Military tensions [with Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/russia-military-exercises-tensions-west-zapad), [with China](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/04/world-war-iii-nightmare-scenario-brewing-in-the-east-china-sea.html), and in the Middle East give most countries good reason to maintain strong militaries.
1.6.12. Pro: Having obligatory community/military service would be very costly.
1.6.12.1. Con: The two years of labour derived from conscripts would exceed the cost of their training, accommodation & rations. There would be a net fiscal benefit to the state rather than a cost.
1.6.12.2. Con: The government paying large amounts of people to do work is effectively [fiscal stimulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_\(economics\)): it would increase consumption, which would increase demand and boost the economy. This would generate tax revenues which would offset the immediate costs.
1.6.12.3. Pro: It was estimated in 1988 that reviving the draft in the US would cost [$1bn.](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/15/us/cost-of-reviving-draft-put-at-1-billion-a-year.html) In today's money, that is likely to be even higher still.
1.6.12.4. Con: Volunteer armies expect higher pay and are harder to recruit than conscripted armies, which means they have higher costs.
1.6.12.4.1. Con: Even if the budgetary costs with a conscripted army were lower, the opportunity costs would be higher, meaning the overall cost would be higher under conscription regardless.
1.6.12.4.1.1. Pro: [A study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10430719308404766) on the Belgian army during conscription showed that the actual cost of the policy was double its budgetary cost.
1.6.12.4.1.2. Pro: [The disruption](http://www.ifn.se/Wfiles/conferences/07varnplikt/Poutvaara_Wagener_Conscription.pdf) that military conscription has on human capital investments leads to lower stocks of human capital, reduced labor productivity, and substantial losses in GDP.
1.6.12.4.1.2.1. Pro: [A study](http://www.ifn.se/Wfiles/conferences/07varnplikt/Poutvaara_Wagener_Conscription.pdf) found that both the constraint on individuals' use of time and the below-average stipends contribute to a reduction of the country's long-run GDP and economic growth.
1.6.12.4.1.2.2. Pro: Under a military formed by volunteers, it is often those with [fewer alternatives](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/03/AR2005110302528.html) who enlist to serve, meaning the alternative output to society that is sacrificed by serving in the military is minimised. This would not be the case under conscription, meaning the cost of private-sector output would be [higher](http://reason.com/archives/1979/08/01/the-cost-of-conscription).
1.6.12.4.1.2.3. Pro: [Keller et al](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/16737/military.pdf?sequence=1) found that, in OECD countries, replacing conscription with an all-volunteer force would increase the GDP growth rate by around a quarter percent or more.
1.6.12.4.1.2.4. Pro: Due to the [national toll](http://www.ifn.se/Wfiles/conferences/07varnplikt/Poutvaara_Wagener_Conscription.pdf) of opportunity costs, the debt imposed on the government through the draft would only be paid off once the last generation of conscripted people catches up with the productivity level it would have had without conscription. \(p.9\)
1.6.12.4.1.2.5. Pro: People choosing community service would take away job opportunities from people who would voluntarily apply for those types of jobs.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.1. Pro: In countries with welfare states, the cost of sustaining a greater pool of unemployed people would outweigh the savings made by using conscripts.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.2. Pro: This is unfair as those who have been drafted for community service get the job ahead of willing applicants without having proven to be more qualified.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3. Con: It is probable that those who actually want to be doing these jobs would be more productive in them. They would likely still get hired or promoted first.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1. Con: Given the high number of 18-20 year olds in most countries, it is unlikely that there would be enough public work for older citizens or non-conscripts to apply to.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.2.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.2. Con: The government would be able to add new job areas for public work with the high number of additional employees working for the state.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: The creation of new forms of infrastructure, such as high-speed rail and public Wi-Fi projects, has the potential to lay the foundation for new economies and industries, start ups, and small businesses. Soldiers could be used to do this.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: The US has a decaying [infrastructure](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/09/engineers-give-americas-infrastructure-a-near-failing-grade.html) system: roads, bridges, sewers, and the energy grid are all in need of extensive repair.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Massive public works projects have a special place in US history. In the New Deal, for example, the US government employed millions of people directly through the [Works Progress Administration](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Works-Progress-Administration) to build much-needed infrastructure.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.2.1.3. Con: It is wrong to force people into this kind of menial labour when it can cause them health problems later in life.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: An estimated [40%](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/construction-workers-struggle-with-pain-stress-from-injuries/) of construction workers are faced with back pain once the reach 50.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.2.1.3.2. Con: Individuals unable to handle manual labor would probably be exempt from service or just given a different job, as a social worker, for example.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.2.1.3.3. Con: These people are older and more fragile, and have been construction workers for decades. Young people have more durable bodies and it is highly unlikely that they would see any lasting effects from doing manual labor for merely two years.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.1.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.6.10.1.1.1.2.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.1.1.2.
1.6.12.4.1.2.5.4. Con: Volunteering is a category of work with infinite demand, and limited supply \(not the other way around\).
1.6.12.4.2. Pro: In the UK, [Phase 1](https://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/costs-per-recruit-for-rlc-infantry-phase-1-2-2015-01-21.pdf) training costs £17000 and is 14 weeks long. Soldiers earn a [salary](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/305915/Soldiers-cannot-afford-to-eat) of £14000 before Phase 1 training and £17265 after. The cost of [food & accommodation](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/305915/Soldiers-cannot-afford-to-eat) is £6480. Thus the cost of a paid soldier over two years is £50651. The cost of a paid conscript over two years is £29960. This means that £20690 is saved per soldier with conscription.
1.6.12.4.3. Pro: In order to convince people to sign up for the military, they often have to pay [competitive salaries](https://toughnickel.com/finding-job/Is-it-Worth-it-to-Join-the-Army-A-Review-of-Army-Pay).
1.6.12.4.3.1. Con: This points to the fact that being in the military is undesirable. The solution to this is to improve the work conditions not to force people into it against their will.
1.6.12.4.3.1.1. Con: Improving working or training conditions for soldiers is not always possible.
1.6.12.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Soldiers are often positioned to work in war-torn, unsafe parts of the world with little infrastructure. This is the nature of the job.
1.6.12.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: Training for soldiers needs to give them the skills to survive on the battlefield. Often, this kind of training needs to take place in a harsh environment.
1.6.12.4.3.1.1.2.1. Con: This training can however be eased in to better prepare conscripts to deal with harsh environments.
1.6.12.4.3.1.1.3. Con: If it is true that the conditions cannot be improved, this implies that they deserve to appropriately compensated for that fact.
1.6.12.4.4. Pro: During the Vietnam War, under conscription, the US did not experience any significant increase in military personnel outlays when troops increased. Contrastingly, during the Iraq War, under a volunteer army, real outlays [rose by 40%](http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2015/Hendersonconscription.html) to meet the cost of enticing and recruiting more troops.
1.6.12.4.5. Pro: In [some countries](https://www.goarmy.com/benefits/total-compensation.html), career officers are often paid benefits on top of their high salaries, such as spousal housing and medical care, which a government would not have to offer to conscripted soldiers.
1.6.12.4.5.1. Pro: 18-20 year olds are less likely to be married than older officers, so spousal support would not be such an issue.
1.6.12.4.6. Con: This assumes that you would employ the same number of people without conscription. However the reality is you would employ significantly fewer, meaning that costs are lower.
1.6.12.4.7. Con: People who are conscripted are being forced into a job they do not want; this will make them demand higher wages, not lower.
1.6.12.4.7.1. Con: If they are legally being forced into those jobs then they have no bargaining power when it comes to wages.
1.6.12.4.7.1.1. Con: Individuals can exert pressure on the state to pay higher wages through voting.
1.6.12.4.7.1.1.1. Pro: By publicly stating their feelings on the matter through mediums such as social media or organized protests, individuals can show what will or won't make them cast their votes on certain political parties, even in between election seasons.
1.6.12.4.7.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.4.
1.6.12.4.7.1.2. Con: Militaries can have unions to negotiate with the state on matters such as wages on their behalf.
1.6.12.4.7.1.2.1. Pro: While not technically registered as a trade union,[The British Armed Forces Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Armed_Forces_Federation) \(BAFF\) fulfills the role of campaigning and providing a voice on behalf of the armed forces in Britain.
1.6.12.4.7.1.2.1.1. Con: The BAFF doesn't have any legal negotiating power as they're not an actual trade union representing the soldiers. This severely impairs their ability to affect change within the British military.
1.6.12.4.7.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: As the British military isn't allowed to join trade unions, the legitimacy of organizations like BAFF trying to act as trade unions is reduced.
1.6.12.4.7.1.2.1.2. Pro: [BAFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Armed_Forces_Federation) puts pressure on the British government to improve the military through campaigns, and provides an independent voice, including media relations, parliamentary lobbying and representations to central and local government.
1.6.12.4.7.1.2.2. Pro: There are several trade unions in Sweden that operate on behalf of the military, including [Försvarsförbundet](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%B6rsvarsf%C3%B6rbundet) and [Officersförbundet](https://www.saco.se/en/english/our-23-unions/swedish-association-of-military-officers/).
1.6.12.4.7.1.2.3. Con: Even with unions, governments will still have all the power because they can force people to work. It is unclear what unions could actually do in this situation.
1.6.12.4.7.1.2.3.1. Con: Unions can make sure that bad treatment of the military doesn't go unnoticed by the public, making the government look bad if it refuses to make improvements.
1.6.12.4.7.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.12.4.7.1.2.1.2.
1.6.12.4.7.1.2.4. Con: British armed forces are not even allowed to join [trade unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Armed_Forces_Federation).
1.6.12.4.7.1.2.4.1. Pro: This implies that there is a significant opposition to letting soldiers be represented by trade unions.
1.6.12.4.7.1.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.6.12.4.7.1.2.1.
1.6.12.4.8. Pro: If conscription is introduced, the state has infinite bargaining power, since no one can refuse its offers. The state can therefore set wages at any level it sees as socially efficient.
1.6.12.4.8.1. Con: -> See 1.6.12.4.7.1.1.
1.6.12.4.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.12.4.7.1.2.4.
1.6.12.5. Pro: Conscription would impose high costs on individual draftees.
1.6.12.5.1. Pro: Conscription could reduce lifetime earnings.
1.6.12.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.
1.6.12.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.6.12.5.1.3. Con: If this is universally true then it would likely lead to slight deflation which would render the impact almost imperceptible.
1.6.12.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.6.12.5.3. Pro: Conscription is essentially an additional 'hidden' tax passed on to young draftees.
1.6.12.5.3.1. Pro: [Conscription](http://www.ifn.se/Wfiles/conferences/07varnplikt/Poutvaara_Wagener_Conscription.pdf) passes an important part of the costs of the military or the social sector to young draftees rather than spreading them more evenly across sections of society.
1.6.12.5.3.2. Pro: [A study](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/8973) found that, in Russia, the financial effects of conscription on individuals were disproportionately large and exceeded the statutory rates of personal income taxes.
1.6.12.6. Con: The government could save on the costs that it would normally expend on public services and maintenance, thereby saving tax payers' money, too.
1.6.12.6.1. Pro: The average hourly rate for a school janitor in the US, for instance, is [$13.76](http://work.chron.com/average-salary-school-janitor-6801.html), which is much higher than the country's minimum wage of [$7.25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States).
1.6.12.6.2. Con: It is immoral to exploit young adults for their labour by paying them wages significantly below what the free market has determined their jobs are worth.
1.6.12.6.2.1. Con: As young adults are often deemed too inexperienced to even get any job at all on the free market, the state is actually paying them wages that are significantly higher than what the free market has determined the young adults to be worth.
1.6.12.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.12.4.1.2.
1.6.12.8. Pro: This policy would harm the job market and education by taking away available workers and students.
1.6.12.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.6.12.8.2. Con: It wouldn't be taking away available workers, it will delay their entrance into the workforce and or in educational institutions. After few years, this will become the norm, and the age of entrance will increase with no major side effects.
1.6.12.8.2.1. Con: The number of people who go through the workforce will indeed be the same, but the number available simultaneously will be reduced, and that is more important.
1.6.12.8.3. Con: This policy would ensure that all young adults between the ages of 18 and 20 are productive members of society.
1.6.12.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.2.1.
1.6.12.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.12.4.1.2.1.
1.6.12.8.5. Pro: Universities would lose income as there would be a constant pool of young adults who wouldn't be able to attend due to serving the community or in the military.
1.6.12.8.5.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.6.
1.6.12.8.6. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.6.12.9. Pro: This policy would require huge amounts of investment to grow the military as a whole.
1.6.12.9.1. Con: The benefits of this investment would impact far more than just the military. It would affect all young citizens.
1.6.12.9.2. Pro: Citizens would need training before being qualified to perform useful service.
1.6.12.9.2.1. Pro: This would require a fairly constant division of officers who were dedicated entirely to this training.
1.6.12.9.3. Pro: It is likely that the current training facilities would be inadequate for the influx of recruits necessitating the construction of new bases.
1.6.12.9.3.1. Pro: The current size of the US military is around 3 million including serving and reserve members. If even half of the 8 million 18-20 year olds joined the military this would more than double their size.
1.6.12.9.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.2.
1.6.12.9.4. Pro: The administration of the new recruits would require a much larger management team than the military would currently have.
1.6.12.10. Pro: It would require the state to pay salaries to all 18-year old citizens who are fit to serve.
1.6.12.10.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.6.13. Con: -> See 1.6.12.4.1.2.5.3.1.2.
1.6.14. Con: Government resources spent for the safety and betterment of the quality of life of its citizens cannot be considered wasted.
1.6.14.1. Con: It can be considered wasted if the resources spent aren't efficiently achieving those goals.
1.7. Con: Obligatory service is an unfair infringement upon citizens' rights to freedom and self-determination.
1.7.1. Con: The rights to personal freedom and self-determination do not override the right of the state to ask citizens to serve in exchange for the ability to exercise those rights.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Compulsory service fosters an environment of greater stability and safety from external threats, which makes it easier for citizens to exercise their individual rights.
1.7.1.2. Con: Outside the context of a threat to the state, compulsory service is no different than forced labor camps which are not even legal \(in the US\) for sentenced criminal prisoners.
1.7.1.3. Con: This is not a relation in which the state asks its citizens to serve in exchange for the ability to exercise personal freedom. The state is ripping away the ability to exercise freedom and forcing its citizens to do its bidding.
1.7.2. Pro: Opportunity for choice is motivating, [choice in education](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-06736-008) promotes learning. [Meta-analysis](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-01984-005) across a wide area of human interactions backs this up. Obligatory service removes the opportunity for choice and would fundamentally change the motivation people have for military service.
1.7.2.1. Con: The obligation to serve society would not remove the choice of how you would do your service.
1.7.3. Con: A citizen is responsible for the maintenance of their civilization.
1.7.3.1. Con: No, rulers are responsible for the maintenance of their civilization. People who are considered citizens without their consent and through no fault of their own are not ethically required to bear any responsibilities that are forced upon them.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: The government has no obligation to provide for citizens’ safety. Insomuch as the military and war are tools of the state to further political goals, the individual security of citizens and non-citizens is peripheral or coincidental to such goal.
1.7.3.2. Con: Military service is not the only way to maintain a civilization.
1.7.4. Pro: In addition to being governmental over-reach, in the USA, this forced labor would infringe the people's constitutional rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
1.7.5. Con: The rights of freedom and self determination are already routinely violated by the government for the order and betterment of society.
1.7.5.1. Con: An occurring mistake should not be used to justify the occurrence of new ones.
1.7.6. Con: Unfortunately freedom has to be protected, and during natural disasters, people need assistance. Living in a free society either means assisting with these tasks, or paying taxes to pay someone else to perform these tasks.
1.7.7. Pro: [In the UK](https://www.forces.net/news/should-national-service-be-introduced-young-people-uk), While over 65s were in favour of conscription, with 74% voting in support, only 10% of 18-24-year-olds said they thought it would be a good idea. As it would only directly affect young people, more weight should be given to their opinion.
1.7.8. Con: The assumption seems to be that this would be obligatory for young people. Perhaps the government would decide conscript people in their 60's to do work for minimal pay.
1.7.9. Pro: Obligatory service takes away two years of people's lives in which their ability to do important things such as develop themselves and maintain their social circles, is significantly harmed.
1.7.9.1. Con: This assumes that the military does not allow individuals to develop their identity and create new social circles when in reality the two years are spent doing just that.
1.7.9.1.1. Con: It is true that their identity may develop while in the military but it may not be the development they want or even beneficial at all.
1.7.9.1.1.1. Pro: The military deploys tried and tested hierarchical social structures that are most likely to win them wars. As such, they stifle the formation of an individual identity.
1.7.9.1.1.2. Con: There is a risk that their identity may not develop in a way that is beneficial or in a way they want even if they don't serve.
1.7.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.7.9.3. Con: If the justification for conscription is for the sake of national security then the needs of the nation outweigh the hardship imposed on the individual.
1.7.9.3.1. Con: People who are considered citizens without their consent and through no fault of their own are not ethically required to bear any responsibilities that are forced upon them.
1.7.9.4. Con: In a ethnically diverse nation, it is important for citizens to become accustomed with people and practices unlike their own so that we do not fall prey to tribalism and socio-ethnocentric feedback loops.
1.7.10. Pro: Article 20 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) states that 'No one may be compelled to belong to an association'. As such, conscription is an infringement on this human right.
1.7.10.1. Con: Individuals have already been compelled to join the state by being born there. It is unclear why this form of association is necessarily different.
1.7.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.3.1.1.
1.7.10.1.2. Con: It is not different. It is similarly unethical. States impose citizenship without consent in the same way that they conscript without consent.
1.7.10.2. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.7.10.3. Con: Conscription is in place in several countries that have signed on to the UDHR, and is accepted. Article 20 therefore clearly does not apply in the case of conscription.
1.7.10.3.1. Con: The hypocrisy of these countries and their ability to continue their abuses does not change the question at hand. Yes, in practice it has not been applied, but the claim is framed with the word "should".
1.7.10.3.2. Con: Many countries break Human Rights, whilst being signatory to UDHR.
1.7.10.4. Con: This is a misreading of the term 'association'.  A state isn't generally considered an association, but rather a union of residents, involving both rights and responsibilities, and citizens are allowed to expatriate and renounce their citizenship at any time.
1.7.10.5. Con: Conscription is the cost of citizenship and/or residency. As long as individuals are free to renounce citizenship and emigrate then conscription is not infringing on their rights. Those that choose to stay have chosen to stay.
1.7.10.6. Pro: Additionally, Article 23 states: "Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.".
1.7.11. Pro: Conscription infringes on an individual's right to consent to potential bodily harm.
1.7.11.1. Con: -> See 1.7.10.5.
1.7.11.2. Con: There is no legal obligation for a State to provide for the common safety of her citizens, therefore there is no legal ground for a citizen to expect protection through any means other than risking their own lives.
1.7.11.3. Pro: Those who serve in the military could ultimately lose their life or sustain serious injuries as a result of their service.
1.7.11.3.1. Pro: Soldiers risk sustaining injuries in battle which could cripple them for life.
1.7.11.3.1.1. Pro: The number of [battlefield injuries](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-froomkin/iraq-soldiers-wounded_b_1176276.html) sustained by American soldiers in Iraq is often understated, and the number of [disabled veterans](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/number-of-disabled-us-veterans-rising/) in the US is rising, despite a decline in total number of veterans in the US.
1.7.11.3.1.2. Pro: Soldiers participating in wars are faced with a substantial risk of suffering [Post Traumatic Stress Disorder](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/health/ptsd-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-statistics-veterans/) \(PTSD\).
1.7.11.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.4.1.1.1.1.2.
1.7.11.4. Con: Those not wanting to risk bodily harm can simply serve outside the military. Examples include education, community activism, non-profit, international NGO, community farming, public works, etc.
1.7.11.4.1. Con: Those whom chose military service may change their minds, and regret their decision.
1.7.11.4.2. Con: Requiring some kind of service would still increase military service, which would lead to more enlistments than in a country without any kind of compulsory service. Therefore, more people would ultimately come to harm \(or cause harm to other people\) in the military.
1.7.11.5. Con: The potential for lasting individual harm with conscription is low.
1.7.11.5.1. Pro: Conscription means that people are less likely to die during times of war as the draftees would have received survival training as part of their military service, and are less likely to take unnecessary risks.
1.7.11.5.1.1. Con: If everyone globally is military trained, then the only likely outcome of war is a greater number of casualties meaning that the individual risk is greater than before.
1.7.11.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.4.1.1.1.
1.7.12. Con: A military that is capable of defending the country from foreign threats guarantees that people are safe enough to freely exercise their rights.
1.7.12.1. Con: A professional millitary is more capable of defending the country than one formed by people forced to be there.
1.7.12.1.1. Con: A professional military recruited from an increasingly small segment of society isolates the larger society from the costs and consequences of military action and makes that society more likely to initiate conflicts.
1.7.12.1.2. Con: Casualties are unavoidable in a war.  As casualties mount, conscription backfills [faster](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/yourcountry/overview/conscription/) than volunteerism.
1.7.13. Pro: The United States only has the [draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States#Post-1980_draft_registration) for times of national emergency and threats to the state. If the welfare of the state is not at risk then the rights of an individual supersede the desires of the government.
1.7.13.1. Pro: Even the draft is unethical. If not enough people support a war to volunteer on their own, the government should have no right to force people into a situation that could harm them and/or defy their political and moral views. The government should represent the people and therefore only fight wars that already have enough public support to garner voluntary enlistment.
1.7.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.2.
1.7.14. Con: There is no principled difference between this policy and the policy of making school compulsory.
1.7.14.1. Con: Unlike school attendance, military service is morally controversial.
1.7.14.2. Con: School should not be compulsory.
1.7.14.2.1. Con: If school isn't compulsory you'll have a lot \(more\) of ignorant people or working children.
1.7.14.3. Pro: Most liberal democracies make school attendance compulsory up to some age or year. Forcing people to attend school from, say, age 5 to age 18, is no different from forcing them to do service from age 18 to 20.
1.7.14.3.1. Pro: School attendance until a certain age \([usually 16 or 18 depending on the state](http://www.ncsl.org/documents/educ/ecscompulsoryage.pdf)\) is mandatory in the US.
1.7.14.3.2. Con: The difference between conscription and school attendance is the potential for individual harm: attending school is unlikely to result in death.
1.7.14.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.11.5.
1.7.14.4. Con: When people reach age 18, they become legal adults and receive most of the rights and freedoms that society offers. While it may be acceptable to restrict people's freedoms before they are 18, it is not acceptable to do so after they are 18.
1.7.14.4.1. Con: Even adults have age based restrictions placed upon them. For example, in many countries legal adults cannot buy alcohol until reaching an age above that of legal adulthood. Conversely, some countries have laws allowing individuals that commit specific crimes to be tried as adults before they reach legal adulthood.
1.7.14.4.1.1. Pro: While the legal age of [adulthood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority) in the US is 18 in most states, people aren't allowed to [purchase alcohol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drinking_age) before the age of 21.
1.7.14.5. Con: Mandatory school is strictly for the benefit of the children participating. Mandatory service forces those serving to work for the benefit of society.
1.7.14.5.1. Con: Mandatory service in a system you benefit from gives you investment in the problems and advantages of the system.
1.7.14.5.2. Con: Educating the populous has societal benefits as well as individual. Countries rightly make education compulsory because it is strategic suicide not to.
1.7.15. Pro: A government should reflect the desires of its citizens. If citizens have to be forced into something for it to work, most do not desire it, and thus the thing should not be done in the first place.
1.7.15.1. Con: A citizen derives benefits from their citizenship and thus must bear the cost of those benefits. Everyone wants benefits without costs but such a thing is impossible. Citizens must be forced to pay the costs or renounce the benefits.
1.7.15.1.1. Con: Obligatory service does not offer a way to renounce the benefits it may bring.
1.8. Pro: Introducing obligatory community service would lead to many benefits for society.
1.8.1. Pro: By doing community service, citizens can ensure that the society they live in is clean and well-maintained.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Cleaner and better-maintained [public spaces](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/06/09/por-que-las-calles-mas-limpias-pueden-ser-mas-seguras) are linked with lower crime rates.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: A clean and well-maintained environment has a higher value, providing incentive to care for it and ensure it stays that way.
1.8.2. Pro: It will give a since of oneness with every other civilian. The youth will be doing same tasks and tackling same issues, and sharing resources, leading to closeness and ultimately oneness.
1.8.3. Pro: Obligatory community service could provide much needed workforce in employment areas that lack workers.
1.8.3.1. Con: An added large supply of low cost labor would implode the job market for social work and drive down wages for people in these industries.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: The result of this would be that non-conscripts would likely leave these professions resulting in a skills shortage despite the increased labour.
1.8.3.1.2. Con: Community service programmes would presumably be organised in such a way that the number of people placed in social care would match the number of vacancies, rather than exceeding it.
1.8.3.2. Con: Obligatory service in employment areas that lack workers is immoral. It's providing forced labor to an industry for the benefit of the industry rather than the benefit of the workers.
1.8.3.3. Con: Some of the [job areas](https://www.fastcompany.com/3066658/these-are-the-jobs-that-will-have-the-biggest-talent-shortages-in-2017) most in need of additional workforce in the US are vets, pharmacy technicians, tax preparers and aerospace technicians. These are all skilled jobs that could not be given to an untrained 18 year old.
1.8.3.4. Pro: There is a dire need for young social workers in many states.
1.8.3.4.1. Pro: In the [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/08/uk-social-care-crisis-staff-shortages), people under the age of 25 make up less than 10% of the adult social care workforce, according to Skills for Care, while more than one-third are over 50.
1.8.3.4.1.1. Con: This doesn't necessarily imply that in the future there will be a lack of social workers. It is plausible that the cause for this discrepancy is that social work naturally attracts those who are older.
1.8.3.4.2. Pro: The Institute for Employment Studies in the UK has predicted severe shortages as one-third of registered nurses in the National Health Service are [due to retire](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/08/uk-social-care-crisis-staff-shortages) in the next decade.
1.8.3.5. Pro: The Office for National Statistics in the [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/08/uk-social-care-crisis-staff-shortages) showed that of the 751,000 externally advertised job vacancies for a three month period across the whole economy, more than 15% – about 117,000 – were in the health and social work sectors.
1.8.3.6. Pro: About [340,000](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/08/uk-social-care-crisis-staff-shortages) social care employees in the UK leave their jobs each year.
1.8.3.6.1. Pro: Because professions like social care don't offer much in terms of opportunities for big earnings and steps to move up in their careers, people have little incentive to stay in these jobs on a long-term basis.
1.8.3.7. Pro: There is a 20 to 25% vacancy rate at social work agencies in the [US](http://www.kristv.com/story/35367353/social-worker-shortage).
1.8.4. Con: -> See 1.6.12.8.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.6.12.
1.8.6. Pro: Mandatory social service will ensure that the most disadvantaged and ignored communities will get access to a basic level of care.
1.8.6.1. Con: The quality of government goods and services that marginalized and low-income communities get is much lower than for better off communities. There is no reason to expect this to be any different.
1.8.6.1.1. Con: One of the main problems poor communities face is a shortage of social workers, which would be dramatically altered by this policy.
1.8.6.1.2. Con: There is no denying that there is a socioeconomic divide when it comes to the ability to access social services, however, the lives of disadvantaged communities still get better than status quo under this policy.
1.8.6.2. Con: In a country with a welfare system, this is already done.
1.9. Pro: Compulsory service helps create shared values and identities in a highly individual and fragmented society.
1.9.1. Con: Forcing someone to act with charity is not genuinely charitable behavior. Forcing someone to put their life on the line against their will is not genuine bravery. Let such actions honor those who choose to give them, instead of praising the reluctant and unwilling as heroes and selfless.
1.9.1.1. Con: It is genuinely brave to serve the military in warfare and choose to comply with the tasks that are forced upon soldiers.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: Conscripts who are drafted can choose to try to get out of fighting in the war by finding excuses for exemption, deserting, or simply not doing what they're assigned once they're deployed.
1.9.1.2. Con: Service is not about praise, it is about contributing to the society we create, pay taxes for, and benefit from. Heroes will still be heroes, but anyone who joins seeking those things is there for the wrong reasons.
1.9.2. Con: Compulsory service creates a particularly divisive form of nationalism, which is likely to be alienating to many within society.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Any shared identity created by compulsory service will not be accessible to people who are, for whatever reason, unable to serve.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: For example, people with disabilities will be excluded from this collective identity.
1.9.2.2. Con: There is no reason to expect that compulsory service is more likely to bring about a divisive form of nationalism, rather than a unifying one.
1.9.2.3. Pro: As non-citizens or people who immigrate when they are older than 20 would not do service, this would further stigmatise these groups.
1.9.2.3.1. Pro: Immigrants who live in a state but do not yet have citizenship status will be perceived as freeloading, or as illegitimate, because they have not completed compulsory service.
1.9.2.3.1.1. Pro: These ideas exist in the status quo because people see "good citizens" as people who contribute to the community. This is an added area where non-citizens cannot contribute but are arguably benefitting from and as such makes the stigma worse.
1.9.2.3.2. Pro: Anti-immigrant sentiment has [historically](https://theconversation.com/what-history-reveals-about-surges-in-anti-semitism-and-anti-immigrant-sentiments-74146) been highest in times of war. To increase the military's profile by implementing compulsory service would see this proliferate in peace time too.
1.9.2.3.3. Pro: This would play into the prevalent and damaging rhetoric of these groups not really being part of, or contributing to, society.
1.9.2.3.4. Con: Non-citizens and immigrants can still choose to volunteer for military service.
1.9.2.3.4.1. Pro: Around [8,000](https://www.thebalance.com/immigrants-in-the-us-armed-forces-3353965) non-citizens enlist in the US military each year.
1.9.2.3.4.2. Con: Even if some volunteer, the fact that they are not required or expected to do so is a mark of difference from the rest of the population.
1.9.2.3.4.2.1. Con: That many non-citizens choose to volunteer despite it not being required nor expected, is likely to be considered admirable and could boost their reputation among citizens.
1.9.2.3.4.3. Con: This is an unreasonable burden to place on someone who immigrates later in life: they have to choose between being shunned as a non-contributing citizen or put their life on hold by doing this service.
1.9.2.4. Con: If the service \(military OR community\) is a universal requirement it would promote more unification than division.  The civilian population would have a better understanding of how the military functions which would help them provide better oversight. The military would be more accountable by being less insulated from the public. Universal service would also encourage a wider range of geographic/cultural experience if some of the service was in other parts of the country/world.
1.9.2.5. Con: What is divisive or nationalistic about military or community service? The government serves the people at the the peoples' whim; it only makes sense that the people also participate and contribute to those institutions to the greatest extent possible. The government is a reflection of the people, not the other way around.
1.9.3. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.4.1.1.1.
1.9.4. Pro: Service to society exposes the conscript to altruistic qualities and expressions of gratitude. These experiences help construct a passionate moral companionship with humanity and the relevant community.
1.9.5. Con: These shared values and identities are not always best for society, and individualism can lead to values and identities that are much better for society.
1.9.5.1. Pro: Initiative, responsibility, and pride in your own work are all values which are good for society and are more likely to develop outside of forced community service.
1.9.5.2. Pro: Values regarded as good in society are always changing, as evidenced by changing norms with gender equality and racism. By forcing a common set of shared values, chances of new values emerging are reduced.
1.9.6. Con: Military-societies inherently posit violence and oppression as guiding cultural principles. Compulsory military service creates a dehumanized cultural condition.
1.9.6.1. Pro: The culture within the Korean military is bad.
1.9.6.1.1. Pro: There is an intense focus on the [reinforcement of stereotypical masculine characteristics](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-14448486) in soldiers, often called 'barracks culture', with the excuse that this will make them more 'battle ready.'
1.9.6.1.2. Pro: Physical, mental and sexual [abuse](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/08/205_210873.html) is rampant in the Korean army.
1.9.6.1.2.1. Pro: One noncommissioned officer \(noncom\) from a front-line unit was punished for [torturing other soldiers](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/08/205_210873.html) with a taser that shoots 90 volts of electricity, and beating them with a shovel and a hammer.
1.9.6.1.3. Pro: The Korean military has such a bad reputation that some even undergo surgery specially designed to [damage body parts](http://www.news.com.au/world/asia/south-korean-army-what-its-really-like-inside-the-worlds-toughest-military/news-story/fa08c1724081352f4756e9cb912388ce) on purpose, landing a medical waiver.
1.9.6.1.4. Pro: The prevalence of bullying has led to mass shootings and suicides within the Korean military.
1.9.6.1.4.1. Pro: A young draftee in [June 2014](https://www.forbes.com/sites/donaldkirk/2014/08/10/s-korean-armed-forces-face-the-enemy-within-sagging-morale-suicides-and-murder/#6cafa1e7400c) shot and killed five other soldiers and wounded five more at a guard post in a mountainous region near the line with North Korea due to bullying.
1.9.6.1.4.2. Con: That is a case of spurious correlation. There is no evidence of this connection. In addition, other countries without mandatory service \(such as the United States\) have experienced similar episodes with soldiers committing acts of [mass violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Fort_Hood_shooting).
1.9.6.1.4.3. Pro: In 2014, The Korean Times reported the [death](https://www.forbes.com/sites/donaldkirk/2014/08/10/s-korean-armed-forces-face-the-enemy-within-sagging-morale-suicides-and-murder/#315ac6c3400c) of a 23-year-old private first class who was bullied, tortured and humiliated by his commanding officers for weeks.
1.9.6.2. Pro: A government with the power to force labor from its citizens is situated on slippery slope where it may become more authoritarian.
1.9.6.3. Pro: The driving principles of human civilization ought to be the mutual benefit of all humans, not violent competition. In a world with more than enough resources to feed every human being living, our culture ought to be moving towards making that happen, not becoming more efficient killers or competitors. Cooperation is the basis of a humanistic civilization.
1.9.6.4. Con: The thesis allows for a non-military conscription option.
1.9.6.4.1. Con: Fair enough, but it being a two-part thesis invites criticism of any part of it, and certainly if that constitutes half of the thesis.
1.9.6.4.2. Pro: Non-military service, such as civil engineers, road workers, national park rangers, census takers, as well as international outreach such as Peace Corps, Doctors without Borders, etc, could be an effective way for those who do not want to serve militarily to still contribute to society in a meaningful way that is less contingent on fitness or age.
1.9.6.4.2.1. Pro: If there were a unified training program including fitness, first aid, firearm safety, etc, we could provide citizens with valuable skills and habits. If all services were then given the option to "bid" on conscripts with the final choice going to the conscript, we could preserve the voluntary nature of civil service while ensuring the general citizenry is directly participating in our society's maintenance.
1.9.6.5. Con: This is not always the case. For example, the [Texas State Guard](https://tmd.texas.gov/state-guard) is a military organization, however its focus is on community service, and is staffed with volunteers and doctors that assist during natural disasters.
1.9.6.6. Pro: Those serving in the military as well as their loved ones will have to come to terms with the fact that serving in the military may include having to fight and kill enemy soldiers. It is easier to come to terms with this if the enemy is dehumanized.
1.9.6.6.1. Pro: Acknowledging the enemy soldiers as humans make them more easy to relate to. This can generate sympathy for the enemy soldier which makes it harder kill them.
1.9.6.6.2. Pro: Even states that are currently at peace often have historical adversaries towards whom aggression and dehumanization would be directed.
1.9.6.6.2.1. Pro: Most of Eastern Europe experiences continual [military tensions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/russia-military-exercises-tensions-west-zapad) with Russia.
1.9.6.6.2.2. Pro: Even during times of ostensible peace, there is military tension between [Sunni and Shia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/04/sunni-shia-sectarianism-middle-east-islam) parts of the Arab world.
1.9.6.7. Pro: The essential operation of any military is to institute and execute mass murder, under the larger operation of calcifying the hegemony of some political power. In fact, the military is the very manifestation of violent coercion. To force an entire population to universally experience complicity in this violence is necessarily to emphasize it above any other human experience that is not made to be distinctly universal within that culture.
1.9.6.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.9.6.7.2. Con: In many instances throughout history, military actions have prevented or limited the spread of hostile, imperialist hegemonic regimes.
1.9.6.8. Con: Militaries are not solely based on the desire to inflict violence; military society emphasizes many positive values like collective solidarity, cooperation, and shared identity.
1.9.6.8.1. Con: These values are inherently pragmatic tools used to serve the larger objective to train humans to murder each other. Collective solidarity, cooperation, and shared identity \(if these are values we even ought to inject into our culture\), can be instilled through any number of other collective institutions. Charitable work, church, activism, volunteering, even joining a soccer team and none of these revolve around murdering people.
1.9.6.8.2. Pro: Good militaries are not remotely based on the desire to inflict violence. Rather, it is to protect and serve, to defend one's family and country from invasion and tyranny, and from infringement of rights.
1.9.6.8.2.1. Con: The rhetoric of "protecting and serving" is here being used as a smokescreen to cover the fact that the mechanism behind the protection and services offered by a military is almost exclusively the killing and organized murder of human beings.
1.9.6.8.2.1.1. Pro: Furthermore, mass-bombings by the West in the middle east are widely accepted as having led not only to persistent regional destabilization but also have served to radicalize populations which are subjected to this violence. Hostile radicalization of otherwise non-threatening populations directly subverts any function of the military as an institution of peacemaking or in the establishment of a safe global culture.
1.9.6.8.2.1.2. Con: "Protecting and serving" is the unique way that Western countries categorize their military services, seeing as they are generally organized by democratically elected governments consisting of more then one party, composed of the general citizenry, and for the express purposes of national defense and peaceful outreach. This runs awry when other political tools, such as policy, are underfunded or executed poorly necessitating military action, or if the government is an autocracy.
1.9.6.8.3. Pro: Much of the modern military mission is humanitarian for strategic reasons. People who see you helping them in their time of need are less likely to take up arms against you. It is best to win a war before the first shot is fired.
1.9.6.8.4. Con: The solidarity or shared identity the military creates is often constructed in opposition to perceived "enemies" or "others."
1.9.6.8.4.1. Pro: In fact, this dynamic is one of the component principles of any military. Militaries exist on the assumption or the dependence on the creation of enemies.
1.9.6.8.4.2. Con: This is historically correct, but does not hold weight in modern conflicts. While deployed in Iraq, I witnessed a professionalism among soldiers foreign and domestic knowing that our enemy today may be our friend tomorrow and vice-versa. A soldier's job is to not to hate, but to execute so that the political goal can be accomplished.
1.9.6.9. Pro: Conscripted military service may increase the chance of war.
1.9.6.9.1. Pro: A military society is more likely to apply military solutions to problems, leading to an increase in war.
1.9.6.9.2. Pro: Compulsory military service may lead to increased nationalism, which would threaten global unity and peace.
1.9.6.9.2.1. Pro: Increased nationalism can fuel an increase in populism, as [recently exhibited](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/02/in-europe-nationalisms-rising/) in European and US elections.
1.9.6.9.2.1.1. Con: Populism and nationalism function according to [different logics](https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/populism-nationalism-and-transnationalism/); while one pits 'the people' against 'the elites', the other distinguishes between those that are in a nation against those who are not.
1.9.6.9.2.2. Con: Nationalism is used to promote national unity and is the [foundation of modern society](http://www.e-ir.info/2013/11/14/does-globalization-diminish-the-importance-of-nationalism/). Sharing values, customs and an identity with others is what enables people to exhibit social solidarity.
1.9.6.9.2.2.1. Pro: National identity is important to the lives of many people.
1.9.6.9.2.3. Pro: Nationalist feelings can create an 'us' and 'them' dynamic that [leads to hostility](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b5f3/de6ae6935476f5b97ab84e33f520ca0455c2.pdf) towards anything perceived as other.
1.9.6.9.2.3.1. Pro: The core idea of nationalism necessarily leads people to the belief that their nation is superior to other nations. This perception of superiority is how people enable states to justify aggressive acts towards other nations.
1.9.6.9.2.4. Pro: [Nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism) means devotion to ones' nation and may blind people to the flaws and harmful practices of their nation. This is a dangerous, uncritical stance of governments that can be abused by a country's rulers.
1.9.6.9.2.5. Pro: Nationalism has been identified as one of the core causes of some of [history's deadliest wars](http://www.e-ir.info/2012/06/19/how-significant-is-nationalism-as-a-cause-of-war/), including WWI and WWII.
1.9.6.9.3. Pro: Conscripted military signals an intent to increase military capabilities. This may be perceived by other countries as a preparation for future wars to come.
1.9.6.9.3.1. Pro: This may threaten or provoke unfriendly nations to escalate already existing tensions.
1.9.6.9.3.2. Con: This is not strictly the case. A society that is highly militarized is not, necessarily, emphasizing external or hostile application of that military presence against their own citizenry or other nations.
1.9.6.9.3.2.1. Con: The simple fact of spending time being trained to kill humans necessarily re-orients the cultural and psychological landscape, however slightly. A nation doesn't need to engage in hostilities in order for its culture to be propagating violence. Wouldn't there be inarguable effects of mandatory emotional intelligence training? Or mandatory time spent in solitary confinement? The mind permanently changes based upon everything that a person experiences.
1.9.6.9.3.2.2. Pro: Despite the fact that the military has a nearly religious status in American society, [most Americans](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/01/30/usa-today-pew-research-poll-americans-question-results-in-iraq-afghanistan/5028097/) oppose the recent wars that America has been involved in, and a [majority oppose](https://www.brookings.edu/research/american-public-attitudes-toward-isis-and-syria/) on-the-ground intervention in Syria.
1.9.6.9.3.2.3. Pro: [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Sweden) had mandatory conscription until 2010, but did not engage in aggressive or hostile foreign policy or military operations.
1.9.6.9.3.2.4. Con: It does not matter what the nation is actually emphasising, the mere increase in military size is antagonistic to neighbours.
1.9.6.9.4. Con: If many countries implement conscription, then the presence of large armies in every state will deter acts of war.
1.9.6.9.4.1. Pro: This is similar to the way that the proliferation of nuclear weapons means that countries are unlikely to commence nuclear war. They know that they would likely be destroyed in return.
1.9.6.9.5. Pro: A higher number of military servants may increase national confidence in ability to conduct warfare, thereby giving an additional reason for people to advocate for war.
1.9.6.9.6. Con: Conscription could make people [think more carefully](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/opinion/lets-draft-our-kids.html) about going to war, reducing military adventurism.
1.9.6.9.6.1. Con: Implementing conscription in the hope that it will act as a deterrent, or minimise adventurism, is taking a risk at the cost of young people's lives; as such, it is an [immoral](http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2015/Hendersonconscription.html) basis for implementing the policy.
1.9.6.9.6.2. Con: The very existence of conscription implies a state which is comfortable with the notion of the military and conflict. It is unlikely that this would act as any deterrent.
1.9.6.9.6.3. Con: -> See 1.9.6.9.5.
1.9.6.9.6.4. Pro: If everybody had a greater stake in the consequences of war, where casualties could be felt by all groups of society, then the likelihood of opposition to warfare would increase.
1.9.6.9.6.4.1. Pro: Mandatory military service could result in less war. If a war meant that your child, relative, or a senator's child had to go, that would make us think long and hard before heading into action.
1.9.6.9.6.4.2. Con: This could also go the other way; people who currently serve are pro-military so with a greater number of people serving, the general attitude toward the military might improve.
1.9.6.9.6.4.2.1. Con: The current subset of people who serve in the military are not an accurate indicator of how the general population feels because they have chosen that path.
1.9.6.9.6.4.3. Pro: Militaries that are composed largely of conscripts will induce more sympathy and concern in the rest of the population, which will make them less likely to support war efforts.
1.9.6.9.6.4.4. Pro: Even people who have passed their term of conscription will fear that their children, siblings, or friends who are conscripts will be killed if the country goes to war.
1.9.6.9.6.5. Con: Without the existence of trained conscripts, a smaller army may be unable to sufficiently defend the country. This puts everyone in the country at a greater risk of being killed as an invasion is more likely to be successful.
1.9.6.10. Pro: Conscription could blur the lines between civilians and military targets.
1.9.6.10.1. Con: Civilians are [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-combatant) as those not taking an active role in the war effort. It is unclear why this dilutes that definition given that individuals are only combatants while in service and while wearing a uniform. They return to civilian life afterwards like any veteran.
1.9.6.10.2. Pro: Hamas have, [at times](https://books.google.co.tz/books?id=ekm2dmSDF_cC&pg=PA304&lpg=PA304&dq=Hamas+justify+attack+on+civilians+due+to+conscription&source=bl&ots=6Jp4YnYUkk&sig=o0JHzkOJqNXuvFAfoLZ2fV7O93U&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Hamas%20justify%20attack%20on%20civilians%20due%20to%20conscription&f=false), justified a disregard for civilian immunity due to the belief that under Israel's universal conscription policy, all civilians are either potential, current or past soldiers. \(p.304\)
1.9.6.11. Pro: Exposing young men and women to weapons and desensitising them to violence may lead to increased criminal tendencies.
1.9.6.11.1. Pro: [A study](http://voxeu.org/article/impact-mandatory-military-conscription-crime-and-labour-market) on conscription in Sweden found that military service significantly increases both the likelihood of crime and the number of crimes between ages 23 and 30.
1.9.6.11.1.1. Con: This study itself highlights the fact that the "effect of conscription on crime is ambiguous" and that many previous studies found the opposite correlation.
1.9.6.12. Pro: The military, and conscription itself, are posited on instilling obedience in citizens, and not questioning superiors. This mindset is dangerously dictatorial.
1.9.6.12.1. Pro: Most modern conscripted militaries, such as [Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Cuba) and [North Korea](https://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/learn-nk-challenges/), are undemocratic and exercise extensive control on citizens more generally.
1.9.6.12.1.1. Con: It seems more likely that the conscription in these nations is a result of the dictatorial regime rather than the other way around.
1.9.6.12.1.1.1. Pro: Both Koreas have conscription, for example, but only North Korea is undemocratic.
1.9.6.12.1.2. Con: There are a number of countries where the conscripted military is not undemocratic including [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Greece) and most of [Scandinavia](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/03/sweden-conscription/518571/).
1.9.6.12.1.2.1. Pro: The [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Norway) system of conscription is largely selective; only those who are motivated are selected.
1.9.6.12.2. Con: This logic would imply that all countries with conscription would be dictatorial in nature. Realistically this is not the case with most of these countries.
1.9.6.12.2.1. Con: It actually doesn't imply that countries with conscription would be dictatorial by nature but rather that there is a larger risk that citizens could become less capable of keeping a critical perspective of their government.
1.9.6.12.2.2. Pro: Sweden, which had [conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Sweden) between 1901-2010 has consistently ranked as a full democracy on the [Polity IV](http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/swd2.htm) test which measures how democratic a country is.
1.9.6.12.3. Con: Conscription is likely to make people relish their freedoms and individuality more. [Conscription during the Vietnam War](http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/vietnam_draft.shtml), for example, helped to push the baby boomer generation in the US to become one of the most rebellious and individualistic in American history.
1.9.6.12.3.1. Con: Benefits gained from resisting a Draft is not a reason that the draft it good. Fighting adversity generally does make people stronger and individualistic \("what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"\) but that doesn't mean we try to give people more adversity in life to gain those benefits.
1.9.6.13. Con: Countries with existing compulsory national service are well regarded by their citizens.
1.9.6.13.1. Pro: Conscription has been [good](https://prezi.com/jfizwmkjqklz/good-effects-of-compulsory-conscription-in-south-korea/) for stability, safety against a North Korean attack and the creation of a national identity in South Korea.
1.9.6.13.1.1. Con: The current massive conscript force is not necessary to counter the threat of North Korea.
1.9.6.13.1.1.1. Pro: The South Korean military is better funded and better equipped than that of the North.
1.9.6.13.1.1.2. Pro: The [United States Seventh Fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet) has 70 ships, 300 aircraft and 40,000 Navy and Marine Corps personnel deployed for the sole purpose of defending the Korean peninsula.
1.9.6.13.1.2. Con: A large bulk of the contemporary threat that North Korea poses is due to large-scale weapon testing. Conscription does not counter this threat in any meaningful way.
1.9.6.13.1.2.1. Pro: Conscription might in fact increase the risk of North Korea using nuclear weapons against South Korea as the ability to defeat South Korea using soldiers becomes harder when South Korea has a larger army through conscription.
1.9.6.13.2. Pro: [Over 90%](http://lkyspp2.nus.edu.sg/ips//wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/NS-study-8-Oct-2013_web.pdf) of Singaporeans deem the National Service important in instilling discipline, defending the nation and building a national identity.
1.9.6.13.3. Con: Conscription in Greece is increasingly unpopular; the Ministry of Defence has stated that [one third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Greece#Attitude_towards_conscription_and_conscripts_.28draftees.29) of draftees never show up for service.
1.9.6.13.4. Con: Russia's conscription policy is [so unpopular](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/8973), that over 90% of Russia’s eligible men avoid conscription by using fake medical certificates, university studies, bribery, or simply avoiding going to drafting stations.
1.9.6.13.5. Con: In a globally interconnected context, navigating strictly along the lines of whether a policy is good for one's own citizenry is short-sighted.
1.9.6.13.5.1. Pro: The concepts of nation states and having national citizens are becoming less accurate and less relevant as the world becomes more globalized. This means that making decisions based on these concepts are becoming less justifiable.
1.9.6.13.5.1.1. Pro: [36% of young people](https://www.weforum.org/press/2016/08/millennials-uphold-ideals-of-global-citizenship-amid-concern-for-corruption-climate-change-and-lack-of-opportunity/) now define themselves as global citizens, meaning they do not particularly identify with as citizens of individual countries.
1.9.6.13.5.1.1.1. Con: Regardless of what they define themselves as, they get privileges from, and have responsibilities to, the specific country where they are registered as a citizen.
1.9.6.13.5.1.1.2. Con: Viewing oneself as a global citizen is not mutually exclusive with being the citizen of a country as well. Global citizenship merely implies that these people view their identity as more than solely their country.
1.9.6.13.5.1.2. Con: This is a reason to abolish conscription if the concept of the nation state eventually falls. While nations still exist and function, this cannot be a justification to not implement it in the first place.
1.9.6.13.5.1.2.1. Con: Implementing conscription might stall the fall of an already dysfunctional concept of nation states. Conscription should be abolished before the concept of nation states falls in order to enable societal progress.
1.9.6.13.5.2. Pro: A highly militarized global community is an unstable and culturally destitute community.
1.9.6.13.5.2.1. Con: As long as states are equally militarised, they are likely to remain peaceful. Instability comes where there is an asymmetry in the power or weaponry available to opposing states.
1.9.6.13.6. Pro: As of 2013, [75.8%](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israeli-views-on-the-israel-defense-forces) of Israelis supported the continuation of the country's conscription policy.
1.9.6.13.6.1. Con: Israel is in a unique situation, in that it actually faces substantial military threats which necessitate a large army. This may explain the support for conscription, and this is not true for most other countries.
1.9.6.13.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.11.2.6.
1.9.6.14. Con: -> See 1.9.6.9.3.2.
1.9.7. Pro: Militaries focus on homogenizing their recruits, which breaks down prior divisions due to ethnicity, culture, or class.
1.9.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.9.7.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.9.7.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.9.7.4. Pro: The experiences of black veterans in WWII were instrumental in [fueling the civil rights](https://artsci.washington.edu/news/2010-02/black-veterans-vital-role-civil-rights-fight) movement in the US.
1.9.7.4.1. Pro: The experience of sacrificing for their country alongside their fellow countrymen [inspired and encouraged](https://www.army.mil/article/183153/how_war_veterans_impacted_the_civil_rights_movement) black veterans to demand better treatment at home.
1.9.7.4.2. Con: While the military undoubtedly played a role in the advancement of civil rights for black Americans, it is questionable whether the same has been true for other racial or sexual minorities.
1.9.7.4.2.1. Con: The [role](https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-act) was not pronounced at first, but took decades to take root in the broader social structure after the executive order was signed in [1948](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Executive-Order-9981). The lack of immediate results is not the lack of impact.
1.9.7.5. Pro: Post-1994, the [Rwandan military](https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/417cc8f2-46c4-4cb0-9c29-29d16ffdc073.pdf) played a crucial role in internally developing an inclusive national identity, and then propagating that identity to the rest of society.
1.9.8. Pro: Militaries and national volunteer groups emphasize ethics of shared social responsibility and duty.
1.9.8.1. Con: Militaries emphasize the ethics of obediently killing when ordered to do so and significantly increase the likelihood that its members will avoid social responsibility and duty by committing suicide.
1.9.8.2. Con: Making public service compulsory removes the significance and meaning associated with it. It would not be a good method of getting people to care more about public service, and would therefore not succeed in creating a wider ethic of social responsibility.
1.9.8.2.1. Con: While it may not engage that many people, it is unlikely to discourage those who already care. The only relevant difference therefore is an increased workforce in public service which is still beneficial.
1.9.8.2.2. Con: On the contrary, its significance would only increase as the state is formally showing how important public service is by making it compulsory.
1.9.8.2.2.1. Pro: As compulsory charity work becomes more accepted, it will become normalized in society. This means that people will start to consider charity work as a fundamental part of society, making them more likely be invested in it and to participate in it voluntarily.
1.9.8.3. Pro: Once people are exposed to volunteer work and the satisfaction that can be derived from helping people, they are more likely to volunteer in the future.
1.9.8.3.1. Pro: Volunteer work in communities [improves wellbeing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK284780/).
1.9.8.3.2. Con: Satisfaction from helping people may be undercut by the negative feelings that can emerge from being forced to work.
1.9.8.3.2.1. Pro: It is plausible that some will take their negative feelings out on those that they're forced to help, blaming them for having a part in taking away the worker's agency.
1.9.8.3.2.1.1. Pro: The study of Corporate Volunteering Programs [\(CVP's, p. 128\)](https://books.google.se/books?id=LT41GeFpE_sC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=mandatory+charity+work+creates+resentment&source=bl&ots=_nMBxAugdB&sig=FKnTBNMfss6jaGuYiyNP2YzQOwk&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFt4H46vLWAhXCQpoKHXJyDIUQ6AEIVjAG#v=onepage&q=mandatory%20charity%20work%20creates%20resentment&f=false) suggests that employees may display negative or offensive attitudes towards the groups that they are helping due to resentment created from feeling that these groups are undeserving.
1.9.8.3.3. Con: Many young people are exposed to charity work already through their schooling or outside programs. The fact that not that many people continue on to long-term charity work suggests that exposure is not sufficient to make people want to do it.
1.9.8.3.3.1. Pro: [More than 50%](https://docs.education.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/youth_volunteering_evidence_review_0.pdf) of Australians aged 15-19 volunteered in some way in 2013, compared to only 36% of adults.
1.9.8.3.3.2. Pro: 55% of young Americans aged 12 - 18 [volunteered](https://www.nationalservice.gov/pdf/05_1130_LSA_YHA_SI_factsheet.pdf) in 2005, compared to only 29% of adults.
1.9.8.4. Pro: Research [indicates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK284780/) that voluntary national service programs \(after controlling for selection effects\) increase people's ability to engage in activism or work with local government to achieve social change.
1.9.8.5. Pro: AmeriCorps, a voluntary national service program, "boosted civic commitments and behaviors" of members of socioeconomically disadvantaged groups by imparting "feelings of belonging to a community and collective efficacy," according to [research](http://feelings of belonging to a community and collective efficacy).
1.9.9. Pro: Militaries focus on instilling strong national identity and pride.
1.9.9.1. Con: Instilling a national identity can be harmful, especially in places where a significant number of [soldiers are immigrants](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/why-trump-should-embrace-americas-immigrant-soldiers/532539/) who cannot participate in that national identity.
1.9.9.2. Pro: The [Israeli military](http://harvardpolitics.com/world/the-israeli-defense-force-and-national-identity/) builds strong links between individuals and the state, which makes people buy into frameworks of national identity.
1.9.9.3. Pro: The UAE [introduced](http://www.oxgaps.org/files/analysis_ardemagni.pdf) military service with the intention of emphasizing a collective Emirati identity over more local identities like tribal membership.
1.9.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.9.7.5.
1.9.10. Pro: Obligatory service would promote more equality among citizens.
1.9.10.1. Con: Many countries have a cultural opposition to females serving in the army. This makes it particularly difficult for female conscripts to be taken seriously when serving in the army.
1.9.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.4.
1.9.10.1.2. Pro: This is on the basis that women are [not as physically capable](http://www.dailywire.com/news/3339/6-reasons-women-shouldnt-register-selective-amanda-prestigiacomo#) as men to endure military service.
1.9.10.1.2.1. Pro: [A study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8477683) found that all-male squads perform better on 69% of tasks compared to gender-integrated squads in the army.
1.9.10.1.2.2. Con: If physical capability is the metric by which the military must decide who is fit to serve and who is not then this should be the sole metric, regardless of sex or gender.
1.9.10.1.2.3. Con: Women proved themselves to be [just as capable](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11896832/Should-women-be-allowed-to-fight-on-the-front-line.html) as men in a BBC Special Forces challenge that put people through an intensive army-style forces training.
1.9.10.1.2.4. Con: Women have played crucial roles in their country's militaries.
1.9.10.1.2.4.1. Pro: During the Algerian war, some of the key symbols of the National Liberation Front, such as [Fatima Zohra Ardjoune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_military_by_country), were women.
1.9.10.1.2.4.2. Pro: In the US, [1 in 7](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-531-90935-6_3) soldiers in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are women and many have been [awarded medals](http://userpages.aug.com/captbarb/medals.html) to commend their bravery and service.
1.9.10.2. Con: Countries which have existing policies of conscription are not necessarily more egalitarian than those which don't.
1.9.10.3. Pro: Giving all citizens an experience of working in similar conditions, for similar pay, will reduce the impacts of social stratification on people's attitudes.
1.9.10.3.1. Pro: By working in low paying jobs that still require a lot of work, the stereotype that people are poor because they don't work hard enough will be undermined.
1.9.10.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.6.2.1.1.
1.9.10.5. Pro: Mandatory enlistment would mean that all citizens, irrespective of their cast, creed, race or economic status, would have to serve their country.
1.9.10.5.1. Pro: Obligatory military service ensures that the cost of conflict is spread equally across society. Under this system, conflict and its effects are felt equally by families independent of income bracket.
1.9.10.5.1.1. Con: People in rich and powerful positions are [more likely](http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2015/Hendersonconscription.html) to be able to waive the draft for those they are close to.
1.9.10.5.1.1.1. Pro: In the US during the Vietnam War, there was a [high correlation](https://books.google.co.tz/books/about/Chance_and_circumstance.html?id=UfkNAQAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y) between high wealth and being given an exemption. \(p.9\)
1.9.10.5.1.1.2. Pro: Former real estate mogul and current US President [Donald Trump](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/02/how-donald-trump-avoided-the-draft-during-the-vietnam-war/) got out of serving in the military during the Vietnam War through a series of student deferments, as well as a medical deferment for a bone spur in his foot.
1.9.10.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.1.4.
1.9.10.5.1.1.3. Pro: [A study](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/8973) on Russia's conscription policy showed that poor, rural households, with a low level of education, were more likely to have sons who were enlisted than urban, wealthy, and better-educated families.
1.9.10.5.1.1.4. Con: [A study](http://www.ifn.se/Wfiles/conferences/07varnplikt/Poutvaara_Wagener_Conscription.pdf) on Germany's conscription showed that males with higher school degrees were more likely to be called to serve than those with a lower education. \(p.10\)
1.9.10.5.1.1.4.1. Con: Being rich or having a powerful social position is not necessarily the same as being well-educated.
1.9.10.5.1.1.4.1.1. Con: There is a [high](http://www.pellinstitute.org/downloads/publications-Indicators_of_Higher_Education_Equity_in_the_US_45_Year_Trend_Report.pdf) [correlation](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/record-gap-social-mobility-rich-and-poor-students-going-university-vince-cable-theresa-may-gender-a7475256.html) in most countries between those that manage to secure higher education, and those that come from wealthy backgrounds.
1.9.10.5.1.1.4.1.2. Con: [Germany](https://www.thelocal.de/20161206/germany-among-top-european-countries-for-education) is one of the countries where the impact of wealth on education is highest. There is a16 percent variation in student performance based on their socioeconomic status.
1.9.10.5.1.1.4.2. Con: Even if this is true, that still indicates that conscription is targeted in ways that are biased against certain groups in society.
1.9.10.5.1.2. Pro: More rich and powerful people would be compelled to participate in community/military service when it is obligatory, than when it is not.
1.9.10.5.2. Pro: It sends a principled message that all have a duty to serve their country, acknowledging all citizens capable of serving as equal.
1.9.10.5.3. Con: This policy would divide society in damaging ways.
1.9.10.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.3.
1.9.10.5.3.2. Pro: This policy is extremely damaging to those who get an exemption.
1.9.10.5.3.2.1. Pro: People who've been exempted face the risk of losing out on job opportunities in countries where patriotism is a dominant part of the national culture.
1.9.10.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: When applying for jobs in later life, the absence of any form of compulsory service will immediately inform the potential employer that you received an exemption.
1.9.10.5.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Given that these exemptions would only be handed out for serious reasons, this would be an effective breach of privacy for the employer to discover this.
1.9.10.5.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: In particular, it would allow the potential employer to discriminate based on your non-completion of the service.
1.9.10.5.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Given that the vast majority of people will complete this service, it seems probable that it would not be considered in job applications as it would not be a distinguishing factor.
1.9.10.5.3.2.1.2. Pro: Patriotism runs so deep in the US that NFL teams won't sign the quarterback Colin Kaepernick due to him having knelt during the national anthem, which is seen as [unpatriotic](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heres-really-why-kaepernick-cant-get-a-job-in-the_us_5980d2e8e4b02be325be01c2).
1.9.10.5.3.2.2. Con: Given that exemptions would be rare and only for serious circumstances, most people would be likely to recognise that the reasons behind these exemptions would be legitimate.
1.9.10.5.3.2.2.1. Con: [Draft evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_evasion) is [substantial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exemption_from_military_service_in_Israel#Statistics) and is becoming more [common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Israel#Exemption_from_service) in Israel.
1.9.10.5.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Every year a sizeable minority try to get out of conscription to the Israeli military.[Faking psychological illness](https://www.vice.com/sv/article/gqkbgx/stories-of-people-faking-psychological-illness-to-get-out-of-the-israeli-defence-forece) has become so common that telling stories about those who's tried to get out of service has become popularized.
1.9.10.5.3.2.3. Pro: In [South Korea](http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2013/12/a-dreaded-rite-of-passage-koreas-mandatory-military-service/), without having served in the military, a young man is rarely accepted as a "man", leading to otherization in many social settings.
1.9.10.5.3.2.4. Pro: Those who are forced to do the service \(and who would otherwise not to do it\) will feel resentment towards those who are granted exemptions.
1.9.10.5.3.2.4.1. Pro: This is particularly problematic as those who receive an exemption are likely disadvantaged to some extent \(whether it be physical or situational\).
1.9.10.5.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: This broad resentment towards certain groups can lead to undesirable policy outcomes such as less welfare and targeted policies.
1.9.10.5.3.2.4.2. Pro: Ethnic tensions can be exacerbated when minorities are participating in the military to a lesser extent.
1.9.10.5.3.2.4.2.1. Pro: In Israel, Arab citizens of Israel who are Muslim or Christian aren't [conscripted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Israel#Exemption_from_service).
1.9.10.5.3.2.4.2.1.1. Con: An increasing number of [Israeli Arabs](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-in-bid-to-belong-israeli-arabs-sign-up-for-israels-army-2016-12) are choosing to volunteer for the Israel military.
1.9.10.5.3.2.4.2.1.2. Con: This is a specific problem in a country in the most ethnically volatile [region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Middle_East) in the world. It does not in general show that the same problem would exist in all militaries.
1.9.10.5.3.2.4.2.2. Pro: Israel's military [exemption](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/world/middleeast/israel-ultra-orthodox-military.html?_r=0) of Ultra-Orthodox Jews is unpopular and has recently been deemed unconstitutional by Israel's Supreme Court.
1.9.10.5.3.2.4.2.3. Con: This is unlikely to be an issue that extends to most countries, as generally, there is no reason why ethnic minorities should be exempt from conscription.
1.9.10.5.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.10.5.1.1.
1.9.10.5.3.4. Pro: People who enjoy doing their service would likely stigmatize those who serve unwillingly.
1.9.10.5.3.4.1. Pro: This would likely erode any personal benefits those serving gain as their poor treatment would make them unhappy.
1.9.10.5.3.4.2. Pro: This could also lead to dangerous hazing rituals as a method of promoting superiority.
1.9.10.5.3.4.2.1. Pro: These [hazing rituals](http://www.therichest.com/rich-list/most-shocking/10-brutal-cases-of-military-hazing/) can include horrible acts such as sexual assault, and in extreme cases even lead to people dying.
1.9.10.5.3.4.2.2. Con: Hazing occurs already in the military, regardless of the existence of conscription.
1.9.10.5.3.4.2.2.1. Con: Conscription would mean that the harms of hazing would be exacerbated as the number of people being hazed would increase in proportion with the increase of conscripts.
1.9.10.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.14.
1.9.10.6. Con: Conscription disadvantages the poor.
1.9.10.6.1. Con: The ways in which those with low socioeconomic status are disadvantaged by conscription is not significantly different from the ways in which those with low socioeconomic status are disadvantaged in most situations.
1.9.10.6.2. Con: Paying for obligatory service would lift many out of poverty.
1.9.10.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.10.5.1.1.3.
1.9.10.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.9.10.5.1.1.
1.9.10.6.5. Pro: It is likely that richer individuals would be able to secure more comfortable office jobs with the help of their connections and the more dangerous positions would be given to members of disadvantaged communities.
1.9.10.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.1.
1.9.10.6.5.2. Pro: Historically, some powerful individuals paid other people to take their place in conscripted forces.
1.9.10.6.5.2.1. Pro: [Andrew Carnegie](http://truth-out.org/archive/component/k2/item/94447:rich-mans-war-and-a-poor-mans-fight), the billionaire rail and steel magnate, paid an Irish immigrant $850 to fight in his place during the US Civil War.
1.9.10.6.5.2.1.1. Con: Carnegie was only able to do this as it was allowed by law.  The [1863 Conscription \(Enrollment\) Act](http://truth-out.org/archive/component/k2/item/94447:rich-mans-war-and-a-poor-mans-fight), allowed an exemption from military service to those who hired a substitute. Such laws, which cause conscription systems to be socioeconomically divisive, would likely not be passed in any reasonably elected, modern, democratic government.
1.9.10.6.5.2.2. Con: This is unlikely to happen in a world where every adult citizen is conscripted to some form of government service.
1.9.10.6.5.2.2.1. Con: Rich people could still use their wealth and influence to take favourable positions within the boundaries of conscription.
1.9.10.6.6. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.4.4.
1.9.10.7. Con: -> See 1.9.10.5.3.2.4.2.
1.9.10.8. Con: -> See 1.9.10.5.3.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.9.6.
1.11. Pro: Military conscription improves the safety and well-being of society.
1.11.1. Pro: Obligatory service would reduce crime.
1.11.1.1. Pro: Many people would be working in public spaces which means that it is more difficult for people to get away with criminal activities without being noticed.
1.11.1.2. Pro: Conscripted soldiers could be deployed to aid the domestic police forces in keeping the streets safe.
1.11.1.2.1. Pro: Just having the public presence of military personnel would act as a deterrent for criminal activity.
1.11.1.2.2. Con: An increase in application of criminal laws might exacerbate the [trend of overcriminalization](https://law.yale.edu/system/files/area/center/liman/document/liman_overcriminalization.pdf), harming citizens rather than increasing safety.
1.11.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.
1.11.1.4. Con: A person with military training is not necessarily a "better" person, and it doesn't protect him from the crime-prone environment. According to a study of British prisoners, [one in 10](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/one-in-10-prisoners-is-a-former-soldier-new-research-reveals-7944479.html) prisoners is a former soldier.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.
1.11.3. Con: Conscription is just a tool to ensure a well staffed military. Conscription itself does not improve the safety of a society. A military improves safety. Conscription may be necessary to build a military but adding conscription to a military that doesn't need it will not improve safety.
1.11.4. Pro: Communities would be better prepared for natural disasters and war.
1.11.4.1. Pro: Military can be deployed for famine, drought, natural disasters and in the art of logistics. Training not only comes in the need for arms.
1.11.5. Con: Military conscription degrades military readiness.
1.11.5.1. Pro: This was proven by the fighting force in Vietnam.
1.11.5.2. Pro: If the military degrades, our society is less safe due to an apathetic military.
1.11.5.3. Pro: This apathy will continue to flow from the military and into every day life in society, making it weaker.
1.11.6. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.2.
1.11.7. Con: There is [evidence](http://www.sole-jole.org/17511.pdf) that conscription increases the tendency of certain demographic groups \(like people from racial minorities or poor backgrounds\) to commit crimes or be unemployed after their period of service.
1.11.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.11.1.
1.11.7.2. Con: Disadvantaged demographic groups are more likely to commit crimes in any setting, but there is no evidence that conscription worsens this trend or the likelihood of unemployment.
1.11.8. Con: Conscription may lead to preemptive emigration, which would be harmful to the country introducing this policy.
1.11.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.5.4.
1.11.9. Con: -> See 1.9.6.12.
1.11.10. Con: Compulsory military for 18-20 year olds puts the life of an entire generation at risk, which could affect that country's future.
1.11.10.1. Con: Unless the country goes to war more often, lives are no more at risk than before compulsory service. During peacetime, people will serve in non-combat roles.
1.11.10.2. Con: A "generation" is usually considered to be around 30 years in scope. There are virtually no biological acts that can be performed only by 18-20 year olds.
1.11.10.3. Pro: The generational concentration could be significant in the event of widespread fatal warfare, as it would leave a concentrated gap in the population which would carry through for years.
1.11.10.3.1. Pro: Large scale war between large militaries [decreases birth rates](http://voxeu.org/article/demographic-consequence-first-world-war) drastically.
1.11.10.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.2.1.
1.11.11. Con: -> See 1.6.12.
1.11.12. Pro: Compulsory service would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the military.
1.11.12.1. Con: Professional armies require soldiers/sailors with years of training. Obligatory training periods tend to be short term and would therefore dilute the training and effectiveness the military in question.
1.11.12.2. Con: -> See 1.6.10.1.1.1.2.3.
1.11.12.3. Con: To require military service of all would reduce the armed forces down to the lowest common denominator. They would be forced to make so many adjustments and accommodations that they'd no longer be able to perform as the defensive fighting forces we need them to be.
1.11.12.4. Con: Obligatory military service restricts the decisions commanders and political leaders can make and would make the military less effective. As a commander, sending a non-volunteer on riskier missions to attack  the target would not work, especially en masse.
1.11.12.5. Con: From a supervisor/superior's perspective, it is easier to work with a volunteer \(someone who wants to be in the military\) than someone who is only there because they are forced to be.
1.11.12.6. Con: As it takes a long time to effectively train new recruits to use sophisticated technology well, militaries may focus less attention on using new technology in the interest of ease, yet at the cost of military efficiency.
1.11.12.7. Pro: This policy would increase the size of the military.
1.11.12.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.11.12.7.2. Con: The effects of the cheap-labour fallacy, which leads to less efficient decisions and a higher humanitarian toll, have been [seen in the past](http://www.ifn.se/Wfiles/conferences/07varnplikt/Poutvaara_Wagener_Conscription.pdf). Napoleon’s poorly prepared winter campaigns to conquer Russia, for instance, were born out of reliance on 'cheap' soldiers made available through conscription and reducing the need to value individual lives.
1.11.12.7.3. Pro: The US military is [having trouble](http://www.politico.eu/article/the-militarys-real-problem-fewer-americans-are-joining/) finding enough recruits.
1.11.12.7.4. Pro: Given that size is on its own a deterrent, a larger number of people employed in the military would increase the safety of the country.
1.11.12.7.5. Pro: Having a larger military by conscription would imply a larger pool of trained reserve officers and soldiers who could be deployed at a time of crisis.
1.11.12.8. Pro: This would allow good workers, who are currently forced to work in support due to lack of resources, to move to more crucial roles.
1.11.12.8.1. Pro: The military cannot function without a large number of people in support roles; compulsory service could help to fill these roles.
1.11.12.9. Pro: An increase in military efficiency allows the military more flexibility to quickly respond to issues when necessary.
1.11.12.9.1. Pro: This is clearly beneficial for countries that face threats to their own country as it allows them to ensure the protection of their citizens.
1.11.12.9.2. Pro: This can be very helpful in responding to humanitarian crises both within the country and in the immediate region surrounding the country.
1.11.12.9.2.1. Pro: The Australian defence force led a [military intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_East_Timorese_crisis) in East Timor in 1999.
1.11.12.9.2.2. Pro: The USA engaged the National Guard in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to aid in the recovery effort.
1.11.12.9.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.4.4.
1.11.12.10. Pro: Conscription would improve how the military operates.
1.11.12.10.1. Pro: With the additional number of soldiers gained through conscription, countries are able to conduct a higher number of military operations at a time and fight wars on a broader scale.
1.11.12.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.1.
1.11.12.10.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.2.
1.11.12.10.2. Con: Conscription means the military has to refocus from prioritizing how to optimize the service that the military provides, to manage all people who join service.
1.11.12.10.2.1. Pro: This includes adding significant efforts and resources to train new additions to military service that are unlikely to stick around after their service has ended.
1.11.12.10.2.2. Pro: This includes having to put effort and focus to motivate those that don't want to be there and to ensure that they do not become a burden or a liability.
1.11.12.10.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.1.1.2.
1.11.12.10.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.
1.11.12.10.2.4. Con: Given the [problems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying_in_the_military) the military has faced with systemic bullying, it is a good thing if they are forced to partially refocus to improving the experience of their personnel.
1.11.12.10.2.5. Pro: The military would have to invest huge time into screening all those who are conscripted.
1.11.12.10.2.5.1. Pro: Given the massive increase in numbers joining, this would likely mean that some unsuitable candidates would slip through the screening process.
1.11.12.10.2.5.1.1. Pro: Recruits have ready access to powerful weapons, they could very easily kill many people if they were in a fragile state of mind.
1.11.12.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.9.6.
1.11.12.11. Con: -> See 1.6.11.
1.11.12.12. Con: A country does not need to train the entire population in order to be ready for external threats.
1.11.12.12.1. Con: A country which has not trained the entire population would be at a disadvantage in a war against a country which has.
1.11.12.12.1.1. Con: A country with better military technology would win a war against a country without any, regardless of whether they choose to conscript civilians into the armed forces.
1.11.12.12.1.1.1. Pro: Two years of mandatory service in the military is insufficient training to make any military effectively more capable than a non-conscripted military.
1.11.12.12.1.1.2. Pro: For example, [India](https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=india) has the world's largest military based on active duty personnel, yet has not been involved in a major war since [1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War), demonstrating that countries with a large military can show restraint in its application.
1.11.12.12.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.11.13. Pro: Conscription will improve policies regarding the military.
1.11.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.2.
1.11.13.2. Pro: Obligatory service allows the general population to understand how their military functions.
1.11.13.2.1. Pro: Obligatory service allows people to get first-hand experiences of how their military operates.
1.11.13.2.2. Pro: Having citizens conscripted to the military would increase participation in national politics as it would affect people directly.
1.11.13.2.2.1. Pro: With their own lives or those of loved ones at risk, people will try to be more informed of the threats faced by their country and will be personally invested in governmental decisions on military policy.
1.11.13.2.2.1.1. Con: Given that most countries only allow voting at the age of 18, most people will not have a reason to become informed until they are required to serve, at which point it may be too late.
1.11.13.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.9.6.4.
1.11.13.2.2.2. Con: The US has the most [powerful army](http://www.businessinsider.com/11-most-powerful-militaries-in-the-world-2014-4) in the world, making it prominent within political discussions in the country, yet American [voter turnout](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/10/even-in-a-historic-election-americans-dont-vote-as-much-as-those-from-other-nations/?utm_term=.7d3b732cd2ef) is lower than most other wealthy nations.
1.11.13.2.2.2.1. Con: Interest in national politics can take other forms than simply voting. In the US there is often significant pressure from the public when it comes to military issues.
1.11.13.2.2.2.2. Con: This low turnout could well be due to a number of other factors including a culture of non-participation. It is entirely plausible that with a smaller military, their political participation would be even lower.
1.11.13.2.2.3. Pro: Obligatory service could make the military reflect the values of the citizenry. Vietnam protests were [effective](https://thevietnamwar.info/vietnam-war-protests/) because of the draft.
1.11.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.13.2.2.
1.12. Con: -> See 1.6.10.1.1.1.2.
1.13. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.6.2.1.
