Discussion Title: First Aid should be taught in schools in the UK

1. First Aid should be taught in schools worldwide.
1.1. Con: Children are too young to be able to provide First Aid. It makes more sense for First Aid to be taught mandatorily every few years throughout adulthood.
1.1.1. Con: Ignorance, in this case, is not bliss. Not teaching children first aid will not somehow guarantee them protection from having someone around them fall ill, nor will it save them the trauma of this happening.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Children may be even more traumatised in an emergency if this trauma is accompanied by a sense of helplessness because they do not know what to do. First Aid training would reduce the risk of this type of distress, at the very least.
1.1.2. Con: Children are [faster](https://edlab.tc.columbia.edu/blog/10822-Do-Kids-Learn-Faster-than-Adults) learners than adults, and their brains are much less fixed in the way they function. It therefore makes sense to teach First Aid at as young an age as possible.
1.1.3. Con: Scouts are already taught basic first aid at age 10.
1.1.4. Pro: First Aid kits can include medical devices that are too dangerous for children \(i.e. Epipens, Glucogon, etc.\)
1.2. Pro: It would take some strain off health services, particularly those which offer free healthcare such as the NHS in the UK.
1.2.1. Con: There are [free](http://www.firstaidforfree.com/) online courses in First Aid available, as well.
1.2.2. Pro: Free First Aid education would likely reduce the number of A&E admissions, lifting some pressure.
1.2.3. Con: First Aid training is provided by the [Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org.uk/What-we-do/First-aid/First-aid-training).
1.2.3.1. Con: The Red Cross and other such organisations charge for First Aid training, meaning that this is not a viable option for all.
1.3. Pro: Teaching first aid could help encourage more students to pursue careers in the medical field.
1.3.1. Pro: Students who might not have had an opportunity otherwise to experience hands-on medical training could realize that they have great passion and/or aptitude for working in that field.
1.4. Pro: It would make children more sensitive to helping others in need and would allow them to learn a basic skill that would help them at all ages in life
1.4.1. Pro: It would help children learn skills to save a life.
1.4.1.1. Pro: A recent statistic, released by St John’s Ambulance, has revealed that [140,000](http://www.thefirstaidzone.co.uk/first-aid-facts?doing_wp_cron=1512572529.8018300533294677734375) people die each year in the UK from incidents where first aid could have possibly saved their lives. If people are taught First Aid from a young age, this could be significantly curbed.
1.4.1.2. Pro: People with even basic first aid training such as what could be provided by the NHS are able to help many people suffering from cuts, burns and scalds, seizures, broken limbs and many more ailments.
1.5. Con: It would be expensive to implement compulsory First Aid.
1.5.1. Con: The monetary benefit of providing a vast number of patients with first aid could potentially cancel out any cost.
1.5.2. Pro: First Aid courses are, on the whole, very [expensive](http://www.firstaid4life.com/prices): a two-day course for a group of 12 focusing on first aid for children costs £1,080 + sales tax \(VAT\). Implementing first aid on a national level in schools may therefore be incredibly costly.
1.6. Con: The school curriculum is already full. Adding in First Aid is not possible without making sacrifices in other areas.
1.6.1. Pro: There is already enormous pressure on school students in many of the current national school systems around the world, such as that of the [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/apr/29/english-secondary-schools-facing-perfect-storm-of-pressures). Students do not need an additional subject.
1.6.1.1. Pro: In the UK, for example, the introduction of the [EBacc](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-baccalaureate-ebacc/english-baccalaureate-ebacc) at GCSE level - a qualification which focuses on a narrow curriculum made up solely of “core” academic subjects - means that students are facing increasing pressure to yield success in these subjects so as to obtain the EBacc.
1.6.1.2. Con: This is a sign of governmental failings that need to be fixed, and not a reason to keep essential First Aid out of national curricula.
1.6.2. Con: Many countries already offer 'Health & Physical Education' as part of their school curriculum; so rather than trying to fit in extra classes, First Aid could easily be taught as an ancillary part of that program.
1.6.3. Con: First Aid training is applicable to all, so is a more efficient use of classroom time than certain subjects currently on some school curricula.
1.6.3.1. Pro: The subject of Design Technology, for example, [teaches](https://www.data.org.uk/for-education/secondary/) students the beginnings of "product design, food technology, engineering, systems and control, electronics, textiles and graphics." While useful skills, these are not applicable to all.
1.6.4. Con: First Aid training should be seen as a vitally important component of a child's education, so space should be made accordingly on curricula even if sacrifices in other subject areas must be made.
1.6.5. Con: After the initial wave of training, First Aid would not take up that much time in school.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Most bodies offering first aid training recommend an initial day- or two-day-long course, followed by [refreshers](http://www.reactfirst.co.uk/live/tips24.asp). Compulsory first aid would therefore not be very demanding on school time.
