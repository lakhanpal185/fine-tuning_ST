Discussion Title: Tiger parenting does more harm than good

1. Tiger parenting does more harm than good.
1.1. Pro: Tiger parenting is child abuse.
1.1.1. Con: It is not abusive to impose high standards on children which can help them to achieve their full potential.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Parents who coddle their children instead of helping them to realise their potential are being actively neglectful.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Studies have shown that children who are [coddled](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-work/201203/has-coddling-entire-generation-children-set-them-fo) have less of a desire to push themselves and to put effort into activities.
1.1.1.2. Con: High standards imposed on children are often external and are not connected to the child's abilities or interests, which is where these standards can become damaging and potentially abusive.
1.1.2. Pro: Tiger parenting can damage children's mental health.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Tiger parenting can make children excessively [self-critical](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/6573461/tiger-parenting-term-childrens-behaviour/).
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The idea that nothing is ever perfect or good enough can undermine children's mental stability and affect their well-being.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Parental approval is crucial for children's wellbeing - if it is only given when the child succeeds academically it can cause serious [distress](https://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/family/tiger-parenting-what-are-tiger-parents-and-am-i-one-417055).
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: [Research](http://news.berkeley.edu/2013/06/18/chinese-parenting/) has found that tiger parenting creates enormously high and unreasonable expectations for children. Such a reality can negatively effect the self-esteem of children because they will think that whatever their achievements, their efforts will never be good enough.
1.1.2.1.4. Con: Unlike Tiger parents, those parents who continually reward and praise their children run the risk of developing too much self-esteem by "[over parenting.](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/features/self-esteem-can-kids-have-too-much#1)"
1.1.2.1.4.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/features/self-esteem-can-kids-have-too-much#1) indicates that children with high self esteem can lead to problems including narcissism, bullying, increased drug and alcohol use, and more teenage sex.
1.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Tiger parents ensure that their children develop a hard work ethic which prevents children from adopting a sense of entitlement that far outweighs their abilities.
1.1.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: Tiger parenting teaches children to develop a strong [work ethic](http://time.com/88125/the-tiger-mom-effect-is-real-says-large-study/).
1.1.2.1.4.2.1.1. Con: Instilling too strong a work ethic in someone can be disastrous for their health. Societies with an extreme emphasis on diligence often [suffer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adelsteinjake/2017/10/30/japan-is-literally-working-itself-to-death-how-can-it-stop/) substantially as a consequence.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Tiger parenting has been linked to high levels of [depression and anxiety](https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/6573461/tiger-parenting-term-childrens-behaviour/).
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Children that do not meet parents' expectations suffer too much from the failure.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Studies have shown that Tiger parenting increases [aggression](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-of-tiger-parents-develop-more-aggression-and-depression-research-shows/) in children.
1.1.3. Pro: Tiger parenting can involve parents incorporating tactics which put pressure on their children to internalize feelings of shame for not conforming to the expectations that are set by their parents. Therefore, tiger parenting can be argued to be a form of emotional abuse.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Tiger parents often [compare](http://hybridparenting.org/is-tiger-parenting-an-eastern-parenting-style/) their children to others in terms of success, or use shame to make it clear to children that their actions affect the whole family.
1.2. Pro: Tiger parenting is based on personal experiences rather than scientific research.
1.2.1. Pro: Amy Chua - who coined the term "Tiger" as a parenting style - justifies her arguments in her book based on [personal experiences](https://www.apadivisions.org/division-7/publications/newsletters/developmental/2013/07/tiger-parenting.aspx) rather than scientific evidence. This is problematic as the lack of science reinforces stereotypes about groups.
1.3. Con: Tiger parenting ensures the child grows up to be mature and successful.
1.3.1. Con: Children of easygoing parents show better developmental outcomes than those with tiger parents.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Parents who adopted a parenting style that was more [supportive](https://www.apadivisions.org/division-7/publications/newsletters/developmental/2013/07/tiger-parenting.aspx) of their children showed the best developmental outcomes. Children with harsh parents showed the worst developmental outcomes, thus debunking the myths about the merits of tiger parenting.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Children raised by parents who adopted a more [supportive](https://www.apadivisions.org/division-7/publications/newsletters/developmental/2013/07/tiger-parenting.aspx) parenting style as opposed to tiger parenting had a higher GPA \(grade point average\), the best socio-emotional adjustment, the least amount of alienation from parents, and the strongest sense of family obligation.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The findings in this study correlate with the results of previous research which found that stricter, authoritarian styles of parenting often goes hand in-hand with [poor](https://www.apadivisions.org/division-7/publications/newsletters/developmental/2013/07/tiger-parenting.aspx) academic outcomes in European American children.
1.3.2. Con: Many children who are [forced](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/08/forcing-your-child-to-become-a-doctor-could-be-the-worst-parenting-decision-you-make) into certain jobs by their parents often end up hating that career.
1.3.3. Pro: According to a participant in a [research](http://news.berkeley.edu/2013/06/18/chinese-parenting/) study, tiger parents show affection to their children in other ways such as cooking food and preparing clothes. This means their children can focus on priorities such as achieving a good education without having to worry about other matters.
1.3.4. Pro: A [study](https://www.livescience.com/26465-tiger-parenting-cultural-style.html) found that the pressure tiger parents put on their children was not a negative thing, but rather this pressure helped motivate children to succeed.
1.3.5. Con: Cultural norms can also explain why some children seem to be more successful than others.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Asian-American parents, who are most associated with tiger parenting, are more likely to view their child's intelligence as something that can be [improved](https://www.apadivisions.org/division-7/publications/newsletters/developmental/2013/07/tiger-parenting.aspx) on compared to European-American parents.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Chinese culture promotes the idea of [enduring hardship](https://psmag.com/education/tiger-moms-the-benefits-of-eating-bitterness-28029) as one of the most important virtues a person can have. This belief in always pushing yourself can explain this success.
1.3.6. Con: There is evidence to suggest that the reason why Asian American students are high achievers is because they are more likely to come from stable, [two-parent households](http://time.com/3426536/tiger-mom-amy-chua-new-study/) rather than as a result of tiger parenting.
1.3.7. Pro: Children who have tiger parents credit their success in life to their [upbringing](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/17/opinion/liu-tiger-parents/index.html).
1.3.8. Pro: Children of tiger parents perform well in education.
1.4. Con: While tiger parenting has been marketed by [Amy Chua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2h3hzT8st0) as a common practice amongst Chinese families in contrast to sloppy Western parenting, this cultural context is dubious.
1.4.1. Pro: Studies suggest that tiger parenting is [not](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/09/tiger-parenting.aspx) standard practice amongst Chinese American families.
1.4.2. Pro: Many Chinese Americans have taken issue with the [accuracy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/freedom-learn/201103/what-do-chinese-americans-think-amy-chua-s-tiger-mother) of Chua's account.
1.5. Pro: Children who are raised by tiger parents are terrible at dealing with setbacks and failures in life.
1.5.1. Con: Tiger parenting can instill [grit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/margaretperlis/2013/10/29/5-characteristics-of-grit-what-it-is-why-you-need-it-and-do-you-have-it/) in children, teaching them not to give up when things are difficult. This makes them better at dealing with adversity.
1.5.2. Pro: Studies show that these children are often unable to deal with [failures](http://www.lauraclydesdale.com/blog-native/are-parents-to-blame-for-childs-fear-of-failure-helicopter-parent-college-anxiety) during their lives at university.
1.5.3. Pro: Due to the constant push for perfection, basic [setbacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/fashion/fear-of-failure.html), such as being rejected from a college club, can make these children inconsolable.
1.5.4. Con: Tiger parenting allows children to gain [confidence](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/17/opinion/liu-tiger-parents/index.html) in their abilities and to be more resilient.
1.6. Con: Tiger parenting teaches children to be disciplined in life.
1.6.1. Con: A non-disciplined mindset is better, as it allows for more diversity.
1.6.2. Con: In an ever changing world, children should be encouraged to find their place in the world, not programmed according to parents' ambitions.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.4.2.1.
1.6.4. Pro: Studies have shown that children who have self discipline are more likely to grow up into ["persistent, positive, healthy and satisfied adults"](https://bigthink.com/think-tank/teach-your-child-self-discipline-without-tiger-parenting-her-to-death).
1.6.5. Con: [Studies](https://bigthink.com/think-tank/teach-your-child-self-discipline-without-tiger-parenting-her-to-death) have shown that children learn self discipline best when they are having fun and are in a stress free environment.
1.7. Pro: Tiger parenting harms the ability of children to form meaningful and lasting relationships.
1.7.1. Pro: By focusing on academic success and quantifiable achievements, tiger parents neglect the development of soft skills.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Limiting playtime and not allowing children to socialise freely makes it difficult for these children to make friends and develop adequate social skills, which are crucial in later life.
1.7.2. Pro: Children raised by parents who adopted a more [supportive](https://www.apadivisions.org/division-7/publications/newsletters/developmental/2013/07/tiger-parenting.aspx) parenting style as opposed to tiger parenting had the best socio-emotional adjustment, the least amount of alienation from parents, and the strongest sense of family obligation.
1.7.3. Pro: According to [research](http://news.berkeley.edu/2013/06/18/chinese-parenting/), tiger parenting resulted in children developing poor social skills, which can negatively impact the ability of children to form meaningful and lasting relationships.
1.7.4. Con: According to a [study](https://www.livescience.com/26465-tiger-parenting-cultural-style.html), children felt a strong connection to their tiger mothers, despite fears that tiger parenting harms the ability of children to form meaningful and lasting relationships.
1.7.5. Pro: Tiger parenting can cause [rifts](https://www.thecut.com/2016/10/i-survived-a-tiger-mom.html) within a family if the child refuses to follow the career path parents often have set out for them.
1.7.6. Pro: Children forced into high-value careers such as law or medicine will often resent their parents if those careers make them unhappy.
1.8. Pro: Tiger parenting stifles creativity and individuality in children.
1.8.1. Pro: Tiger parents impose rigorous external standards on their children, such as getting good grades on school tests. Forcing children to conform to these external metrics means they do not have time to develop unique or individual abilities.
1.8.2. Pro: Tiger parents typically [coerce](https://medium.com/human-parts/i-grew-up-with-a-tiger-parent-and-all-i-got-was-this-lousy-psychological-trauma-1c260eb138f4) their children to follow traditional, well-paid career paths \(law or medicine\), regardless of what the child's passions or interests are.
1.8.3. Pro: The world of risk-taking and spontaneity is inaccessible to children who grew up with tiger parents.
1.8.3.1. Con: Risk-taking is directly associated with negative personal outcomes such as [addiction](https://www.nclap.org/risk-taking-behavior-and-addiction/). It is not something to be encouraged.
1.8.3.1.1. Con: The values regarding conformity and structure \(i.e. deference to authority, earnest striving middle-class servility, harmonious relations\) that tiger parenting pushes are an attempt to explain away personal cowardice, lack of character and absence of conviction.
1.8.4. Con: Tiger parents often encourage their children to learn how to play musical instruments to a high standard. For these children, playing music can be a channel of self-expression and creativity.
1.8.4.1. Con: When learning to play instruments, children are often not allowed to be creative and instead must [conform](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-older-dad/201101/is-being-tiger-mom-really-the-best-example-good-parenting) to playing whatever their parents think is best.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: Forcing children to learn instruments for the sake of external achievement rather than love of music itself is likely to make them avoid artistic pursuits in later life.
1.8.4.1.2. Pro: Amy Chua relates stories of forcing her daughters to practice instruments for hours on end even when they didn't want to, an exercise completely at odds with encouraging self-expression or creativity.
1.9. Con: Tiger parenting makes life easier for the parent.
1.9.1. Con: Tiger parenting creates children who are quiet, subservient, and easy to handle, and thus creating a child that is expected to give respect, without needing to respect in return.
1.9.2. Con: In [studies](https://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/family/tiger-parenting-what-are-tiger-parents-and-am-i-one-417055) based on US data, tiger parents reported lower levels of wellbeing during child-related activities.
1.9.2.1. Pro: There may be a [link](https://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/family/tiger-parenting-what-are-tiger-parents-and-am-i-one-417055) between what are regarded as the best parenting practices \(e.g. tiger parenting\) and more miserable motherhood.
1.9.2.2. Pro: The [maternal unhappiness](https://www.goodtoknow.co.uk/family/tiger-parenting-what-are-tiger-parents-and-am-i-one-417055) that seems to accompany tiger parenting may be harmful to children as well.
1.9.2.3. Pro: According to the [study](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/parenting/i-was-a-toxic-tiger-mum-but-ive-learnt-the-error-of-my-ways/), tiger parents were more likely to feel exhausted and under pressure, and enjoy being a parent a lot less than their peers. There was less leisure time and also more tension between the parents, which soured the atmosphere in the home.
1.9.3. Pro: It is important to make the life of a parent easy. Parenting is exhausting, and the careful management of time and energy is an important way to ensure that they have the resources to do it well.
1.9.3.1. Con: Convenience is not a good reason for emotionally neglecting children and not striving to be a good parent.
1.9.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.9.3.2. Con: Evidence suggests that children suffer from poor mental health as a result of tiger parenting, the effects of which could be quite burdensome and exhausting on the emotional well being of the parent.
1.9.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
