Discussion Title: Should we be worried about American democracy under President Trump?

1. Concern about American democracy is appropriate under President Trump.
1.1. Con: Alarmism contributes to hysteria on the left with an intense focus on one man, Donald Trump, which is both a regrettable and dangerous place to be.
1.1.1. Con: Not wanting a racist, sexist president has nothing to do with left or right.
1.1.1.1. Con: Neither racism nor sexism have been actually proven. His presidency celebrated [low black unemployment](https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ac10bb8e91cf8a4fc68261276d6ccd104b444a0d-800x533.jpg), signifying they are actively trying to help minorities. He also gave [women public and high positions](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-women-who-ve-got-trump-s-back-n799646).
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Though [not conclusively](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/10/omarosa-trump-book-the-apprentice-memoir) [proven](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/08/15/is-trump-a-racist-you-dont-need-an-n-word-tape-to-know/?utm_term=.77526a23865b), many [still believe](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-omarosa-tapes-n-word-the-apprentice-racist-white-house-us-president-a8486441.html) that he has used the [n-word](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjkam5/poll-most-republicans-think-a-good-president-could-say-the-n-word) and is [probably racist](https://deadline.com/2018/08/white-house-donald-trump-no-guarantee-not-use-n-word-omarosa-dog-not-racial-1202445277/).
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many within the Republican party, as well as Trump supporters [simply don't care](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/ej-montini/2018/08/15/omarosa-manigault-newman-donald-trump-n-word-sarah-huckabee-sanders/999076002/) if he is racist. This already shows a considerable degrading and erosion of the democratic values America is based on.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Trump may give women high positions, but his [derogatory](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html) [remarks](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/us/politics/donald-trump-tape.html) and [treatment of women](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-04/billy-bush-says-infamous-access-hollywood-trump-tape-is-real/9224358) is a case of proven [fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape), [not opinion](http://time.com/5047771/donald-trump-comments-billy-bush/).
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Trump has had [multiple](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-melania-stormy-daniels-affairs-marriages-timeline-2018-3) [extra-marital affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal), some within a [year of](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43334326) his children being born. This has been [testified to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels%E2%80%93Donald_Trump_scandal) by his own lawyer, who[plead guilty](https://globalnews.ca/news/4399826/michael-cohen-plea-deal/) to [paying them off](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/21/17765348/michael-cohen-guilty-plea-stormy-daniels-hush-money) with Hush money at Trump's direction. These are not the actions of someone who respects women.
1.1.2. Con: Many prominent conservatives [are critical](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/26/conservative-resistance-rightwingers-trump) of Donald Trump.
1.1.3. Con: Accusing the other side of hysteria presumes that it cannot make reasonable arguments, thereby avoiding or making impossible a respectful debate.
1.2. Con: This level of concern blots out the ability to objectively appreciate positive developments in the country that may be attributed to Trump.
1.2.1. Con: Arguments that presume that the other side's inability to remain objective should be seen critical as they make unwarranted assumptions.
1.3. Con: Any calls for concern are outweighed by the fact that this is the first President in our lifetime who came from outside the political establishment and its entrenched practices.
1.3.1. Con: "Since he paid for it himself, he should be able to do whatever he wants" is not a healthy way to approach things.
1.3.2. Pro: Trump supplemented a significant portion of his campaign expenses with his own funds rather than special interest dollars.
1.3.2.1. Con: Donald Trump's campaign was [about 20%](http://fortune.com/2016/12/09/donald-trump-campaign-spending/) funded by Donald Trump's personal money.
1.3.3. Con: Where the President comes from does not necessarily prove that he is good or bad.
1.3.4. Con: Ronald [Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan), the 40th president, was an actor before becoming a politician.
1.3.5. Con: This is simplistic thinking. The fact that a candidate is "non-establishment" doesn't eliminate the possibility that \(s\)he may be motivated by other interests, such as self-enrichment, promotion of a personal ideology, or even escaping legal difficulties.
1.4. Con: The constitutional checks and balances are well able to constrain a Trump Presidency should it go above and beyond what it is legally allowed to do.
1.4.1. Con: If Congress, the Courts, and elections are compromised then Constitutional checks and balances may be non-existent.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Donald Trump has been appointing [laughably unqualified](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/15/opinions/trump-judge-nominee-petersen-bad-day-callan-opinion/index.html) judges [based on their loyalty to him](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/when-loyalty-fails/552146/) rather than their legal expertise.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Various parts of the [senate](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/09/politics/devin-nunes-trump-congress-republican-majority/index.html) and congress have proven [partisan](https://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/editorials/article216443225.html) "[Party over Country](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/9/17670930/devin-nunes-tape)" and [do not seek](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/08/09/devin-nunes-in-secretly-recorded-tape-tells-donors-gop-majority-is-necessary-to-protect-trump-were-the-only-ones/?utm_term=.cf5c7e9450b4) to [curb or restrain Trump's](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/08/08/devin-nunes-audio-protecting-trump-rosenstein-impeachment-timing/943636002/) excesses, but rather [shield and protect him](https://nypost.com/2018/08/09/nunes-secretly-recorded-at-fundraiser-we-have-to-protect-trump-from-mueller/), giving him free reign and [immunity](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1001584/Devin-Nunes-Donald-Trump-Mueller-Russian-inquiry-mid-terms).
1.4.1.3. Pro: Trumps latest selection for [supreme Justice](https://www.justsecurity.org/59356/setting-record-straight-brett-kavanaughs-views-criminal-investigation-president/) is [controversial](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/03/brett-kavanaugh-controversial-supreme-court-nominee-five-reasons/1143100002/) at best and seen by many as an [attempt to](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/9/17551584/brett-kavanaugh-president-criminal-investigation) [stack the deck](https://www.thenation.com/article/brett-kavanaugh-argued-sitting-president-law/) and [protect himself](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/10/trump-scotus-pick-kavanaugh-favors-shielding-presidents-from-probes.html).
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: The call for an FBI investigation into Judge Kavanaugh's alleged past misconduct, while welcome, has been [severely curtailed and limited](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6261661/The-White-House-DID-limit-FBI-probe-Kavanaugh-sex-claims-says-bureaus-director.html) by Trump and the White House, to the point of being almost useless and pointless.
1.4.2. Pro: The Trump administration's travel ban for various countries deemed unsafe was [challenged and blocked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_challenges_to_the_Trump_travel_ban) by various courts, showing that America's constitutional safeguards work.
1.4.3. Con: All Trump has to do is appoint justices who are more loyal to their party than to the Constitution, and the definition of what he is "legally allowed to do" may suddenly change.
1.5. Pro: President Trump is a Commander in Chief who cannot and/or will not defend America from election interference, particularly that which continues to be perpetrated by Russia.
1.5.1. Con: The White House has [formally accused](https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-blames-russia-for-massive-2017-cyberattack-1518736888) Russia of the NotPetya attacks as soon as evidence for them has surfaced. This shows that they take credible threats to security seriously.
1.5.2. Pro: President Trump has not articulated a public policy of deterrence, one that promises retribution by the US in response to election interference campaigns and other cyber-attacks.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act \(CAATSA\)” was passed into law nearly unanimously through congress and signed into law by President Trump in August of 2016. Trump in late January of 2018 [refused to implement the sanctions authorized by the law](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-russia-sanctions-trump-no-new-congress-law-election-hacking-intervention-putin-kremlin-a8184866.html).
1.5.3. Pro: President Trump's choice to [trust the words](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/11/politics/president-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-election-meddling/index.html) of Vladimir Putin, leader of a rival great power nation state, over the data accumulated and judgments rendered by the US intelligence community [via a broad consensus](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-russia-elections/u-s-2018-elections-under-attack-by-russia-u-s-intelligence-chief-idUSKCN1FX1Z8) is troubling.
1.5.4. Con: Actually it was the Obama admin \(not Trump\) who knew of the foreign interference and did nothing of consequence.[An upcoming Senate report is expected to slam Obama's response to Russian election meddling](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/senate-report-expected-to-slam-obama-response-to-russian-meddling.html)[Obama knew about Russia election meddling, did nothing](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/obama-knew-about-russia-election-interference-did-nothing-trump)
1.6. Pro: President Trump continues to undermine the judiciary and its role within America's democracy.
1.6.1. Pro: Without the support of the citizenry, expressed through an ever-growing alarmism response to specific actions or inactions, the Trump train will keep chugging down his track to the apparent detriment of the country.
1.6.2. Pro: President Trump has repeatedly referred to the criminal investigations by the Justice Department and the FBI as a "[disgrace](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/trump-blames-justice-department-and-fbi-for-conduct-he-says-was-a-disgrace.html)" and a "[hoax](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/trump-blames-justice-department-and-fbi-for-conduct-he-says-was-a-disgrace.html)".
1.6.3. Pro: President Trump's firing of James Comey was motivated by the President's desire to instigate an expedient conclusion to the investigation into the Trump campaign's collusion with Russia. The firing represents a \(potentially unlawful\) obstruction of the work of a public law enforcement agent.
1.6.3.1. Con: Since it has been proven that Comey [lied under oath](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/18/trump-comey-lied-protected-hillary-clinton-243897), his behaviour was unsuitable to remain as head of the FBI. This behaviour includes his interference [in the](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/02/hillary-clinton-trump-election-loss-russia-fbi-interference) [2016 elections](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/09/james-comey-fbi-fired-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-emails). It might be his bad leadership that led to Trump's election in the first place.
1.6.4. Con: The Judiciary is secure, and independent. Trump's twitter criticisms have no influence and the Executive Branch has complied with all judicial rulings that did not turn in their favor \(travel ban, DACA, etc.\).
1.7. Con: Due to term limits, Donald Trump cannot do irreparable damage to the democracy of the US.
1.7.1. Con: Of course, he could be [declared President](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-china/trump-praises-chinese-president-extending-tenure-for-life-idUSKCN1GG015) \(Dictator\) [for life](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-praises-xi-jinping-power-grab-give-that-a-shot-china) by [removing term limits](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/03/politics/trump-maralago-remarks/index.html), ensuring a GOP stranglehold on the Presidency. Along with other changes that could be implemented to reduce democracy.
1.7.1.1. Con: Republicans have claimed Trump's comments about China's president being made a position for life and maybe the US giving that a try someday were made in jest and have branded them a joke.
1.7.2. Con: A Presidential term is four years and an incumbent is limited to two terms. A lot can happen in four years, never mind eight.
1.7.2.1. Pro: World changing events can happen in four minutes \(nuclear war, signing of an executive order etc.\), never mind four years.
1.7.2.2. Pro: World War 1 lasted four years. It would be hard to argue that it did not do lasting harm to the World order. World War 2 lasted six years \(and America only participated in four of those\) and it would be impossible to say it did not have lasting impact.
1.7.3. Con: Perhaps not permanent harm, but certainly long-lasting harm that may take a generation or a life-time to repair.
1.8. Pro: Under Trump, the US House of Representatives in the past year and a half has [attempted to systematically](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2018/09/27/devils-triangle-wikipedia-entry-edited-by-anonymous-member-of-congress-after-kavanaugh-hearing/) [undermine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/143.231.249.133) and [disrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:143.231.249.133) Wikipedia, adding and spreading [mis-information](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=861497321&oldid=839322382).
1.8.1. Con: People making humorous wikipedia edits is hardly undermining Congress or Democracy. Also based on the humor, those edits were likely done by a liberal, so you are chasing up the wrong tree.
1.9. Pro: Trump and the Republican Congress have casually discarded many important norms in American political life in order to achieve their policy goals. The real danger is not from Trump himself, but from some future President, regardless of party, who will be able to do whatever he or she wants.
1.9.1. Con: The Trump administration has acted within the law and powers of the executive branch, calling this undemocratic is misrepresenting the facts. Where challenged, the administration has complied with court direction: Muslim ban, family separation, DACA, etc.
1.10. Pro: Some people fear Trumps policies and rhetoric mirror and parallel historical [fascism](https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion/videos/709612966076334/?t=16), turning America fascist.
1.10.1. Con: Liberals have redefined fascism to slander and insult the opposition. It's not productive and genuinely hurts the reasoned function of the Republic.[Why you should stop calling Donald Trump a fascist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/04/why-you-should-stop-calling-donald-trump-a-fascist/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.dd098b06634b) Policy wise, the experts consider him a Centrist.
1.11. Pro: The magnitude of President Trump's [lying](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html) undermines the legitimacy of the democratic system and is embarrassing for America.
1.11.1. Con: Recent developments in digital platforms have made it so that all media are less than trustworthy. If the [media were trusted more](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/why-do-americans-distrust-the-media/500252/), and their coverage was [less biased](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/12/media-bias-continues-90-of-trump-coverage-in-last-/), he would not get away with lying.
1.11.1.1. Con: The term 'media' is a plural noun that encompasses all newspapers, magazines, web sites, radio/tv broadcasts, and so on. Claims that 'all media' not being trusted or 'all media' being biased are simply impossible to support.
1.11.2. Con: What counts as an embarrassment is highly subjective. A significant share of the US population is apparently not at all embarrassed by President Trump and supports him.
1.11.2.1. Con: Whole populations can be wrong about things. See: Germany and Nazism.
1.11.3. Con: I'd say Trump is guilty of hyperbole but not lying. He exaggerates but his comments are directionally accurate.
