1. Should a Animal Shelter refuse food from a bullfighting company?
1.1. Pro: Yes, they should because it would be like accepting blood money.
1.2. Pro: Yes, because if they accept the money, they would have been saying they were okay with bullfights.
1.3. Con: No, its dumb, the animals have nothing to do with the arguments
1.4. Con: NO, they should accept all food. All food is useful and the person who donate it shouldnt be a valid criteria.
1.4.1. Con: If the entity that donates the food is inhumane to animals, animal shelters would be hypocrites to accept.
1.5. Pro: Yes, because bullfighting money comes from the death of bulls and bulls dont have less rights then dogs or cats.
1.6. Con: No, because bullfighting is okay and has nothing to do with abandoning animals.
1.6.1. Con: Bullfighting kills approximately [250,000 bulls](http://www.hsi.org/issues/bullfighting/) each year.

1.8. Pro: Yes, because every animal non profit organization has to fight for the defense of all animals, not just the ones they directly defend.
