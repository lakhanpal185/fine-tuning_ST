Discussion Title: Should Rights Movements Stop Focusing on Differences?

1. Rights movements should stop focusing on differences
1.1. Con: Focusing on a specific group allows movements to point down laws and issues that are problematic.
1.1.1. Pro: Although focussing on difference can garner the label of [radical](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/20/we-need-radicals-for-social-change), this has historically been the way to create change.
1.2. Con: Group based movements are at an advantage to generate public support from that group.
1.2.1. Pro: Many people who need support feel alienated from mainstream norms. A group which emphasises differences and [embraces](https://www.metrocentreonline.org/) them can offer important support.
1.2.1.1. Con: Emphasising difference requires the creation of stereotypes. This puts [pressure](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/06/gay-stereotypes-rights-venues) on members of the group to conform, and alienates some who are unwilling to do so.
1.2.2. Con: But a clear emphasis on difference and division between different groups and the rest of the community undermines public good will.
1.3. Con: These rights groups exist because there is a \(perceived or real\) difference between them and 'the majority' that they want to address. If there was no difference there would be no need for a rights group or change. Thus it is important to state the difference they want to address.
1.3.1. Pro: These movements are not about differences in the value of people among different groups, as some suggest \(there are no such differences\). They are about differences in how these groups are treated. And that is absolutely legitimate.
1.3.2. Pro: Opponents of rights movements \(eg. women or blacks\) often argue the group already has equal rights, and further activism \(eg. feminism or black lives matter\) is not justified. A focus on differences in treatment in society is needed to counter such a narrative.
1.3.2.1. Con: In Western society, every individual \(including women and blacks\) has in fact equal rights. The differences in people's quality of life originate in their specific situations, not in differing rights.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: This is debatable; for as long as rights movements feel the need to fight, there is an obvious disparity.
1.3.3. Pro: A focus on difference provides provides a counter to the mainstream idea of normal. For example, the black power movement's focus on difference gave people confidence to follow fashions and culture that [differed](http://civilrhodes.blogspot.com/2010/12/embrace-vs-assimilate.html) from the existing norm.
1.3.3.1. Pro: The ["Black is Beautiful"](http://www.theblackinstitute.org/black_is_beautiful) campaign, provided a juxtaposition to the image that mainstream media sold Americans at the time. This was vital to giving people confidence.
1.3.4. Con: Often oppression is arbitrarily based on a difference, but has little to do with it. For example, the [level](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/05/the-57375-years-of-life-lost-to-police-violence/559835/) of police violence visited upon African Americans is not due to any cultural difference, and it is not necessary to emphasise a difference to demand reform.
1.4. Pro: It would bring those who don't feel they are a part of any movement into the discussion.
1.4.1. Con: Or it could alienate people that don't feel acknowledged enough.
1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.4.3. Pro: Highlighting the fact that other people also do not feel part of mainstream society can give vulnerable people hope.
1.4.4. Pro: In order to succeed, rights movements need to build a social network to drive [recruitment](http://open.lib.umn.edu/sociology/chapter/21-3-social-movements/). This depends upon attracting individuals who's interests align with the movement.
1.5. Pro: By not using terminology that differentiates, equality can become the true focus.
1.5.1. Pro: Rights are innate in the human condition. As such, if there is a right for one person or groups that is taken as 'real' it must apply to all individuals regardless of the group they are placed into by the observer. If this generality can not be applied to all, then it is not a right, but a privilege, entitlement, or something else entirely.

To fight for one's right is to fight for everyone's right to the same.
1.5.2. Con: Refusing to focus on difference obscures what rights are really being denied and what oppression is occurring. This makes equality impossible.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Equality requires more than treating everyone equally. Everyone [must](http://www.intercultural.ie/content/what-equality) have their unique needs facilitated. To do this we must acknowledge differences.
1.5.2.2. Pro: To ignore differences entirely means to ignore injustice. Just like being entirely "colourblind" means being blind towards racism.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: This could cause a pushback from the rights movements as they feel their identity is lost.
1.5.2.2.2. Con: Not focusing In differences doesn't equal ignoring those who discriminate unfairly. Not personally caring about someone's skin color doesn't mean you won't care when someone else does, especially if it's a negative prejudice.
1.5.2.2.3. Pro: Those who have privilege often do not consider the ways in which other people's lives are more [difficult.](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/why-its-important-to-think-about-privilege-and-why/) An emphasis on how others lead different lives and face different challenges is necessary to educate the privileged majority.
1.6. Con: Unification of rights movements may been seen by oppositions as more direct attack and may leads to an increase in attacks.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.5.2.2.
1.8. Pro: Removing of often emotionally charged group associations may lead to more rational discussion.
1.8.1. Pro: Less of a focus on differences, would alienate the majority less. This would allow for a more productive discussion of reforms.
1.8.2. Con: This form of assimilation makes it easy for minorities to be ignored by an apathetic majority. Real agitation and glaring distinctions are required to motivate change.
1.8.3. Con: When Martin Luther King was killed he was less popular than Trump is [now.](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/04/martin-luther-king-jr-50-years-assassination-donald-trump-disapproval-column/482242002/) It is not necessary to avoid polarisation in the interest of achieving results.
1.9. Pro: Unifying rights movements allows for a pooling of resources and ideas as well as man-power.
1.10. Pro: Banding together will limit opposition's ability to use ad hominem attacks on group as it isn't just one type of people any longer.
1.10.1. Pro: Defining a movement by the differences that apply to all of its members draws focus from the people who happen to speak for the group.
1.10.2. Con: It is easier for groups to band together when they do not focus on differences.
