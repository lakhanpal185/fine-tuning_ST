Discussion Title: Is There A Limit To Free Speech?

1. There is a limit to free speech
1.1. Pro: Offending people for no reason breeds animosity in society.
1.1.1. Con: It also provokes emotive, engaging discussions; this may be ultimately beneficial.
1.1.2. Pro: There is never a good reason to offend or upset another person.
1.1.3. Con: At times, speaking one's mind, or expressing one's opinion might offend someone. Free speech is not just one person's right to talk, it is also one's right to an opinion and right to express that opinion, with the risk of offending someone.
1.2. Con: Nobody can be trusted to hold the responsibility of determining the limit and enforcing it.
1.2.1. Con: Many democratic governments currently hold that responsibility, and are enforcing it, for instance by criminalising threats.
1.3. Pro: Free speech has its limit when it incites violence.
1.4. Con: Difficult to decide on the limit.
1.5. Pro: A single person/celebrity with offensive language and free speech can cause mayhem in absence of limits.
1.5.1. Pro: Donald Trump is a perfect example of this.
1.6. Pro: With free speech limited, healthy debate grows instead of sarcasm and trolling.
1.6.1. Con: This is highly debatable.
1.7. Pro: Society learns to respect each other when there are reasonable limits on free speech.
1.7.1. Con: This seems optimistic; limiting free speech may make people more irate, and less inclined towards respecting other opinions.
1.8. Con: Art will be bound by this limit as well.
1.8.1. Con: Where art promotes genuinely harmful - not simply offensive - ideas, in the interests of safety, dignity, and respect, it should be restricted.
1.9. Con: A limit on free speech could be used to shut out genuine freedom.
