Discussion Title: US and NATO Should Withdraw from Afghanistan

1. US and NATO should completely withdraw from all combat and peacekeeping roles in Afghanistan.
1.1. Con: A reduction in influence of Western nations in Afghanistan will be accompanied by a rise in Russian and Chinese influence in the country, creating a new power balance that will be even worse for the country.
1.1.1. Con: Both the Afghanistan and Pakistan governments have [welcomed Chinese mediation](https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/the-history-of-chinese-mediation-between-afghanistan-and-pakistan/); they view the Chinese government as a neutral and trustworthy third party that can help bridge the gap between the two states.
1.1.1.1. Pro: It was at Beijing's request that Pakistan and Afghanistan established a [crisis management mechanism](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/212944-Pak-Afghanistan-agree-on-China-led-mechanisms-for-crisis-management) which would enable the two sides to maintain timely and effective communications in case of any emergencies, including terrorist attacks.
1.1.1.2. Pro: China wishes to [stabilise](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1624513/3-china-talks-military-base-remote-afghanistan/) Afghanistan because it fears Uighur members of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement are passing through Afghanistan into Xinjiang to carry out attacks.
1.1.1.3. Pro: China wants to [include](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-pakistan-afghanistan/china-pakistan-to-look-at-including-afghanistan-in-57-billion-economic-corridor-idUSKBN1EK0ES) Afghanistan in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor \(CPEC\). This would increase infrastructure investment in Afghanistan.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: China and India [constantly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/04/21/new-silk-road-or-new-great-game-india-developing-new-sri-lanka-port-to-combat-china/#4643d102206a) battle with infrastructure aid for influence in their region. Increased Chinese investment in Afghanistan will also force its regional rival, India, to [increase investment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2018/02/27/china-needs-a-win-in-afghanistan-to-keep-its-edge-in-asian-trade/#d7315591d5c7) in Afghanistan to secure regional influence.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Pakistan are more likely to cooperate with Russia and China than with the US, as they are wary of the US's growing ties with [India](https://www.firstpost.com/world/us-pakistan-ties-on-the-fritz-a-look-back-at-the-tempestuous-diplomacy-between-two-nations-4297987.html).
1.1.2. Con: All regional players, including China and Russia, have [signalled](https://thediplomat.com/2017/09/will-pakistan-part-ways-with-its-proxies/) to Pakistan that their support for the Afghan Taliban cannot continue. An increase in their influence will continue to place pressure on Pakistan, especially as these countries are increasingly looking to invest in Afghanistan.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Russia is increasingly [investing](https://www.tolonews.com/business/russian-businessmen-looking-invest-afghanistan) in Afghanistan.
1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.1.2.3. Pro: China and Russia have already held [meetings](http://www.dw.com/en/an-afghanistan-conference-without-afghanistan/a-36922029) with Pakistan to attempt to come up with a solution for the conflict in Afghanistan.
1.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.1.3. Con: Iran is interested in building a new “[silk road](https://gandhara.rferl.org/a/central-asia-iran-trade-route/27509047.html)” trading route that runs from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf, which could best flourish in a peaceful Afghanistan.
1.1.3.1. Pro: A US withdrawal and significant reduction of support to the current government of Afghanistan would reorient Iran’s approach to its neighbor to the east. Iran would likely find it in its own [interest](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/537252/) to cease its [support to the Taliban](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/05/world/asia/iran-afghanistan-taliban.html), with which it has factional tensions, and lend support to the Afghan government, or to broker a settlement between the two.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The fundamentalist Sunni-Taliban government of Afghanistan and the orthodox Shia government of Iran came to the brink of war in [1998](http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9810/02/iran.afghanistan/index.html). The Taliban repressed Afghan Shiites, many of whom live in the western part of the country, near the Iranian border. Iran also provided arms and financial assistance to the [Northern Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Alliance) of Afghan Tajiks and Uzbeks, who never surrendered to the Taliban government.
1.1.4. Pro: Russia's [geopolitical strategy](http://carnegie.ru/commentary/75425) is based around competing with and undermining the US: creating a more divided Middle East is aligned with that strategy.
1.1.4.1. Con: It is not within Russia's interests to seriously destabilise Afghanistan.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Russia views instability in Afghanistan as a [threat](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium-explained-what-s-russia-doing-back-in-afghanistan-1.5467373) to its influence in the former Soviet republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikstan, with which it shares borders. It is in its interest to push for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
1.1.4.2. Con: If the United States left Afghanistan, Russia would find it [reasonable](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/537252/) to assist the Afghan government in its fight against the Taliban. Russia has already aided the anti-Taliban [Northern Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Alliance) in the past.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Russia [supported](https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-a-2001-10-09-43-putin-66967627/378388.html) the US entering Afghanistan to fight the Taliban in 2001.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Russia intervened in Syria for many reasons, but [fear of a jihadi victory](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/537252/) there was central. A Taliban victory in Afghanistan would be as problematic for Russian security because Islamist groups from the Caucasus—hostile to the Russian government—could then find sanctuary there, as they have in the past.
1.1.4.2.3. Con: It is not necessary that Russia will align with the Afghan government and fight against the Taliban.
1.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Russia is [already supplying](https://theconversation.com/why-russia-is-back-in-afghanistan-86663) the Taliban with weapons: a withdrawal of Coalition troops will ensure their influence grows.
1.1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Russia’s courting of the Taliban is an expression of its fear that Washington will seek permanent bases in Afghanistan and interfere with Russia’s effort to dominate Central Asia. If Washington withdraws, Russia has no reason to support the Taliban \([Felbab-Brown, p. 10](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/afghanistan_hopes_pitfalls.pdf)\).
1.1.4.2.3.2. Pro: The Taliban and Russia share [opposition](https://www.fpri.org/article/2017/06/iran-russia-taliban-reassessing-future-afghan-state/) to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and ISIS, both of which operate inside Afghanistan. Moscow and the Afghan Taliban already [exchange](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/24/europe/putin-taliban-isis/) intelligence and information regarding ISIS.
1.1.4.2.3.3. Con: In the absence of US forces, the Taliban would most likely be pointed towards Russia. This will force Russia to change strategy and to fight against them.
1.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.3.1.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Causing trouble for the US and NATO in Afghanistan serves Russian interests by [diverting](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/02/russia-game-afghanistan-170223095212195.html) American pressure from Crimea to a slightly less proximate area.
1.1.5. Pro: Both Russia and China have shown an interest in expanding their reach in Afghanistan by granting the latter observer status in the [Shanghai Cooperation Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation), a Eurasian political, economic and security organization based in China and of which Russia is also a member.
1.1.6. Pro: China is already in [talks](http://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/china-in-talks-over-military-base-in-remote-afghanistan-officials) with Afghanistan about potentially building a military base in the country.
1.1.7. Con: This is for the Afghan people to decide, not something the US should unilaterally decide for Afghanistan.
1.1.8. Con: The USSR did not only wag war in Afghanistan during its presence there. The USSR also completed many [civil projects](https://www.rbth.com/international/2016/08/18/5-soviet-infrastructure-projects-that-survived-the-afghan-wars_622105) like infrastructure, the Afghan dam, hospitals and schools. Afghanistan is near China and Russia, so the prospect of valuable cooperation is much greater.
1.2. Con: A withdrawal of forces would result in infighting between various government, military and militia factions, possibly resulting in an all-out civil war.
1.2.1. Con: The withdrawal of Coalition forces would allow the Afghan government to negotiate with the Taliban more successfully.
1.2.1.1. Con: The Taliban have maintained that they are only willing to [negotiate directly](https://thinkprogress.org/trump-negotiate-taliban-longest-war-32d19e195e05/) with the US, something that the Trump administration has refused to do. The Taliban view the Afghan government as a puppet government without any real legitimacy or authority, hence negotiating with them would be pointless. Withdrawal of US forces would not change this outlook.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Yet the Taliban have not immediately rejected the latest peace offering from President Ghani; instead, they hailed Ghani's speech as '[excellent](https://www.rferl.org/a/afghan-taliban-cool-ghani-peace-offer-while-20-countries-kabul-process-support-it/29069945.html)' and are studying the proposals. This indicates that there is a chance that the Taliban negotiate directly with the Afghan government.
1.2.1.2. Con: The US preemptively withdrawing would mean losing leverage in the negotiations, as the Taliban would already have gotten what it wants.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Since foreign combat troops began withdrawing in 2014, the Taliban has [expanded](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42863116) to threaten almost 70% of Afghanistan.
1.2.1.2.2. Pro: Despite US investment in the Afghan security forces and the presence of US and NATO troops, only [57%](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-war/afghan-government-controls-less-than-60-percent-of-country-watchdog-idUSKBN15G40M) of the country’s districts were under the Afghan government's control or influence in the beginning of 2017. The figure represented a 15 percent decrease in territory held compared with the same time in 2015. A complete withdrawal will likely make it even more difficult for the government to stay in control.
1.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: The Afghan security forces are [not yet capable](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/spotlight/2017_High-Risk_List.pdf#page=17) of providing security for the whole country.
1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: US forces are the [only reason](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/16/world/asia/kabul-green-zone-afghanistan.html) Kabul is as secure as it is right now. Without their presence, not only would the national government have no safe city to base itself in, Kabul itself would become a bloodbath as the Taliban try to gain control.
1.2.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.2.1.2.2.1.3. Con: [Operation Shafaq](https://www.tolonews.com/afghanistan/operation-shafaq-2-progressing-slowly-mod) has been conducted almost solely by Afghan security forces and has made significant, albeit slow, progress against the Taliban.
1.2.1.3. Pro: President Ashraf Ghani has recently adopted a more [conciliatory tone](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-taliban/afghanistans-ghani-offers-talks-with-taliban-without-preconditions-idUSKCN1GC0J0) towards the Taliban, indicating the Afghan government wishes to seriously negotiate with the Taliban.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: President Ghani has offered to treat the insurgent group as a [legitimate political party](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-peace-talks.html): his government was willing to provide the Taliban with an office in the capital, Kabul; passports for their members; help resettle militants’ families; and assist in scrubbing the names of top commanders from international terrorist blacklists if they came to the negotiating table.
1.2.1.4. Pro: A major demand of the Taliban is the [immediate withdrawal](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/02/taliban-obstacles-afghanistan-peace-talks-160225095920107.html) of all foreign forces: doing so preemptively would help the negotiating process.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.2.2. Con: The current stalemate in Afghanistan has led to considerable [war-weariness](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/277804-the-afghan-stalemate). It is unlikely that all sides will continue to fight each other without giving peace a try.
1.2.3. Con: This assumes that the presence of foreign military will prevent the infighting and civil war. The infighting and civil war has been taking place even during occupation. Foreign occupation in Afghanistan has only made external states complicit in the power struggles, aggression, and ethnic cleansing.
1.2.4. Pro: The presence of foreign troops allows for a degree of stability, which has resulted in significant improvement in the lives of Afghans. If the US withdraws, then the national government will likely collapse and the positive changes reversed.
1.2.4.1. Pro: The Afghan government itself is [divided and fragile](https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/a-house-divided-how-afghanistans-national-unity-government-is-crumbling/). An outbreak of violence between the various factions involved is likely, especially if the US leave and the security situation deteriorates.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: President Ashraf Ghani has been [accused](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/afghanistan-has-many-problems-its-president-may-be-one-of-them/2016/09/01/8e00cd00-6e11-11e6-993f-73c693a89820_story.html?tid=a_mcntx) [of being](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/divisions-within-afghanistans-government-reach-a-new-crisis-point/2016/11/15/4b18bc70-aa87-11e6-8f19-21a1c65d2043_story.html?utm_term=.35778f0f8b4f) autocratic, intellectually arrogant, disrespectful of local political culture, and of centralising decision making far too much in his own hands, bringing many government functions to a stand still. This has led to considerable opposition and defections, threatening to dissolve the government and create instability in the country.
1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.1.
1.2.6. Pro: Afghanistan cannot be formed into one cohesive nation because of strong [ethnic tensions](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/society.htm) and a [complex tribal system](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/tribal-strategy-afghanistan#chapter-title-0-5).
1.2.6.1. Con: If this is true, then the continued presence of US military will have no hope of success, and only impose a never-ending tyrannical state upon individuals who desire to freely choose whom they would associate.
1.2.6.2. Con: The idea that Afghanistan can not be cohesively united is an argument against continued occupation, not an argument for it. Where one of the stated goals of the occupation at this point is help Afghanistan create a cohesive government, it stands to reason that if such a cohesive government is not possible, then the occupation is only an expensive, deadly endeavor that will never succeed. It is a venture that should have been avoided altogether.
1.3. Con: The West ought to combat terrorism around the world.
1.3.1. Con: A large military presence in Afghanistan is not needed to combat terrorism, much like the US does not have a military presence in all the other countries which have terrorist outfits operating within their borders.
1.3.1.1. Con: ISIS in Afghanistan has proved [resilient](https://www.rferl.org/a/islamic-state-proving-resilient-afghanistan-targeted-campaign/28659602.html) despite a targeted campaign against its forces, and has even expanded to at least five provinces. This is despite US military and intelligence forces being on the ground; a total withdrawal will only leave ISIS with less opposition.
1.3.1.2. Con: Withdrawal of coalition forces results in more safe-havens for groups like al-Qaeda, allowing them to replenish their numbers and resources over time \([Felbab-Brown, p. 13](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/afghanistan_hopes_pitfalls.pdf)\).
1.3.1.3. Con: A complete withdrawal of all forces would create a power vacuum that the various terrorist organisations in Afghanistan, including the Taliban, will exploit, possibly leading to their rule in the country.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: The only reason the Taliban have increased their influence across the country over the past few years is because the Obama administration [ended](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/01/trumps-afghan-strategy-could-actually-work/) offensive combat operations against the Taliban. A complete withdrawal will result in a significant increase in the power of the Taliban.
1.3.1.3.2. Pro: US aggression towards ISIS in Afghanistan has [reduced](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/world/asia/eastern-afghanistan-isis.html) their force from 3000 to 700, and diminished its area of operation to three districts from 11. If these forces withdrew, then ISIS will have free reign to take over more territory.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: ISIS may soon [receive](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/persistent-expanding-worrisome-isis-rebounds-afghanistan) a large number of reinforcements in Afghanistan as foreign fighters continue to flee Syria and Iraq.
1.3.1.3.2.2. Con: In this scenario ISIS will still have to [contend](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/persistent-expanding-worrisome-isis-rebounds-afghanistan) with the Taliban, which continues to prove a diversion from their struggles against the Afghan state.
1.3.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.1.3.4. Pro: The Taliban has been presenting itself as a [legitimate administration](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/08/afghan-government-funding-taliban-run-schools-militant-group/) in large portions of Afghanistan. Leaving now would only provide it with more legitimacy as the Afghan government would have fewer resources to compete.
1.3.1.3.4.1. Pro: The Taliban has stated that it intends to [support and provide security to](https://thediplomat.com/2016/12/taliban-pledge-to-protect-infrastructure-projects/) Afghan infrastructure projects including CASA-1000 and the TAPI pipeline.
1.3.1.3.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.1.
1.3.1.3.4.3. Con: [92%](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2018-01-03/why-taliban-isnt-winning-afghanistan) of Afghans support the national government, and only 4% support the Taliban.
1.3.1.3.5. Pro: Ceding power to the Taliban and other groups allows them to export terror around the world.
1.3.1.3.5.1. Pro: Although the Afghan government controls only part of the country, its presence [impedes](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/09/05/the-case-for-continued-u-s-involvement-in-afghanistan/) the Taliban’s ability to host the large-scale training apparatus that allowed al-Qaida and other groups to flourish before 9/11.
1.3.1.3.5.1.1. Con: Terrorist tactics have evolved with time, as al-Qaida and similar groups, rather than operating via large-scale training camps, instead conduct recruitment [increasingly](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11207681/How-terrorists-are-using-social-media.html) through social media. This means training and recruitment processes are not nearly as reliant on being in one place as they used to be.
1.3.1.3.5.2. Con: The Taliban are [not a terrorist organization](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/taliban-terrorists-white-house/story?id=28588120).
1.3.1.3.5.2.1. Con: A 2002 executive order labels the Taliban a "Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity" and a 2008 Congressional law mandates that the Taliban be considered a terrorist organization for immigration purposes. The US has [refrained](https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-taliban-us-list-foreign-terror-groups/3732453.html) from applying the terror label to the Taliban because it would restrict the US and Afghan government's diplomatic contacts with the Taliban, making peace talks more difficult.
1.3.1.3.5.3. Con: The [Taliban](http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/367) do not have global objectives. They have acted only to advance regional goals.
1.3.1.3.6. Pro: The Taliban, like many other insurgency groups, thrive off of high morale. Giving them a perceived victory over a world superpower \(through the US withdrawal\) would be a [psychological jolt](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/09/05/the-case-for-continued-u-s-involvement-in-afghanistan/) to all Jihadists. This would help their recruiting, fundraising and morale in general.
1.3.1.3.6.1. Con: The Taliban effectively use the point that Afghanistan is an unconquerable country, and that the Afghan people will never be broken as a [propaganda line](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/afghan-taliban-happy-continue-war-after-trump-vows-victory-n794776) to sustain resistance to foreign occupation. If foreign forces withdraw from Afghanistan, then the Taliban would have to address governance issues to establish legitimacy.
1.3.1.3.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.4.
1.3.1.3.6.1.2. Con: The Taliban, in the early 2000s, would have continued to lead a successful government, had the U.S. not invaded and [toppled](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/taliban-afghanistan) their regime. It is unclear why they could not resume this previous order.
1.3.1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.
1.3.1.3.8. Pro: The Taliban perpetrate and endorse [violence against women](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25398935), something which the US ought to fight against.
1.3.1.3.8.1. Con: Violence against women is unfortunately [prevalent](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/violence-against-women.htm) in many countries of the world and promoted by many groups. This in itself does not justify US intervention in these countries or against these groups.
1.3.1.3.8.1.1. Con: The Taliban is uniquely oppressive and violent towards women. It [condones](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-25398935) public stonings, genital mutilation, and [denial of access to education](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/afghanistan#d91ede). Few other groups match this level of persecution, like Boko Haram or ISIS. The US should also help combat these groups in the name of human rights.
1.3.1.3.8.2. Con: There is no reason to believe NATO staying in Afghanistan is likely to improve women's rights in the long term.
1.3.1.3.8.2.1. Pro: Given that Trump has actively denied there will be Western [nation building](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/21/545044232/trump-expected-to-order-4-000-more-troops-to-afghanistan) in Afghanistan, it is unlikely that the West will have a say in the treatment of women in the country even if the Taliban are defeated.
1.3.1.3.8.2.2. Con: Women's rights [improved](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26747712) in Afghanistan after the Taliban were removed from power in 2001. There is no reason to believe that they would not improve upon defeating the Taliban again.
1.3.1.3.9. Con: The Taliban are [extremely unpopular](https://thediplomat.com/2017/04/why-the-taliban-cannot-win-the-afghan-war/), which would make any sort of national government impossible to form or sustain.
1.3.1.3.9.1. Pro: 93% of Afghans fear encountering the Taliban \([A Survey of the Afghan People, p.7](https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016_Survey-of-the-Afghan-People_full-survey.Apr2017.pdf)\).
1.3.1.3.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.4.3.
1.3.1.3.9.3. Pro: The Taliban is almost entirely [Pashtun](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2018-01-03/why-taliban-isnt-winning-afghanistan), alienating the [58%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan) of the country who are not.
1.3.1.3.9.3.1. Con: This was once the case, but the Taliban is evolving to compete. Since 2008 the Taliban began to portray themselves as multiethnic and since 2014 they began [recruiting](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2017/1026/How-Taliban-are-evolving-to-compete-in-Afghanistan) ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmen, and even Shiite Muslim Hazaras.
1.3.1.3.9.4. Pro: The Taliban's connection to Pakistan \(only liked by [3.7%](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2018-01-03/why-taliban-isnt-winning-afghanistan) of the Afghan population\) causes them to be unpopular.
1.3.1.3.9.5. Con: The Taliban is extremely [wealthy](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-v-micallef/how-the-taliban-gets-its_b_8551536.html), which can buy them significant power and influence, and therefore popularity, in Afghanistan, a relatively poor country.
1.3.1.3.9.5.1. Pro: Drug trafficking and narcotics are the main financial resources of the Taliban. According to the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction \([SIGAR](https://ariananews.af/u-s-inspector-general-sees-taliban-defeat-impossible-without-elimination-of-narcotics/)\), winning the war against the Taliban is impossible without elimination of narcotics in Afghanistan.
1.3.1.3.9.5.1.1. Pro: The cultivation and trafficking of illicit drugs puts the investment in the reconstruction of Afghanistan at risk. The narcotics trade supports the insurgency and feeds organized crime and corruption. Despite a US investment of $8.5 billion in [counter-narcotics](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/spotlight/2017_High-Risk_List.pdf#page=43), Afghan opium production is at an all-time high. Production increased by [87 percent in 2017](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/opium-production-afghanistan-reaches-record-high-180317115934376.html) and 9,000 tonnes were produced.
1.3.1.4. Pro: The presence of NATO forces and US military specifically has [eroded the ties](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-17339775/afghans-lose-patience-with-nato-say-mps) and influence Western states have had on the Afghan populace. This undermines foreign military's capability to conduct [counter-insurgency](http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/general/articles/counterinsurgency.aspx) operations.
1.3.2. Con: Continued occupation of Afghanistan only serves to encourage radicalisation and terrorism, and makes the West a target of such attacks.
1.3.2.1. Con: While the occupation of Afghanistan initially caused anti-Western sentiment, withdrawing would not necessarily ease such sentiment; much damage has already been done.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: The Taliban strategy [relies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/america-is-relying-too-much-on-military-power-in-afghanistan/2017/08/10/102a565e-7d19-11e7-a669-b400c5c7e1cc_story.html?utm_term=.a2ba48535574) heavily on the American presence in Afghanistan in order to bolster anti-American sentiment among potential recruits and the broader populace. Without that presence it is likely such sentiments will ease.
1.3.2.2. Pro: The growing prevalence of [lone wolf](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-changing-face-of-lone-wolf-terrorism_us_59f9f9b2e4b0b7f0915f636c) terrorism means that the radicalisation of even small numbers of individuals can have deadly consequences.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Civilian casualties and the presence of Western troops leads to the [radicalisation](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/PB188-Afghan-Youth-and-Extremists.pdf) of Afghans and observers from other nations.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: US presence in Afghanistan has led to an increase in the activity of the Taliban in [Pakistan](https://www.democracynow.org/2014/12/17/the_destabilization_of_pakistan_tariq_ali).
1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Drone warfare is a common source of anti-Western sentiment and outrage at the US' actions in the region, which causes radicalisation \([Rahimullah, p.23](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/bitstream/handle/10072/59871/93055_1.pdf)\).
1.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: While there is little polling data on Afghans' opinion towards drones, it is unlikely to differ significantly from the attitude of Pakistanis, [89%](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/02/us-drone-strikes-pakistan-terrorists) of whom think that drones kill innocent people.
1.3.2.3.2.2. Pro: The architect of the US' drone strategy, General McChrystal, [worries](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/general-mcchrystal-on-drones-they-are-hated-on-a-visceral-level/266914/) about the impact of drones upon local opinion.
1.3.2.3.3. Pro: Most drug labs being targeted under Trump's counter-narcotics policy are the primary livelihood of ordinary people, and are usually located in populated areas. Destroying them with no provision for alternative sources of income, and the probable killing of civilians in the process, will increase popular support for the Taliban. Accounts from areas affected by the bombing already indicate the airstrikes have mainly hurt civilians and their livelihoods rather than the Taliban. \([Osman, pg.3](https://d2071andvip0wj.cloudfront.net/11Dec17%20-%20U.S.%20Bombing%20of%20Afghan%20Drug%20Labs.pdf)\)
1.3.2.3.3.1. Pro: Neither the Afghan government, nor the US forces, reported that there had been civilian casualties in the attacks. However, given that the drug labs for processing the opium poppy into heroin in Afghanistan are not clearly marked stand-alone factories, but rather improvised facilities, often operated in civilian residences, it is likely that there could have been [civilian victims](https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/from-bad-to-bombing-us-counter-narcotics-policies-in-afghanistan/).
1.3.2.3.4. Con: Anti-Western/American sentiment is caused by a hatred of what the West stands for as well as its action: withdrawing from Afghanistan would not meaningfully affect this.
1.3.2.3.5. Pro: Many extremists who have committed attacks in Western nations have [cited](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2012/Threats-Within/Terror-Coercion-Foreign-Policy/EN/index.htm) the war in Afghanistan as motivating them to do so.
1.3.2.3.5.1. Pro: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who with his brother carried out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, claims he was [motivated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/boston-bombing-suspect-cites-us-wars-as-motivation-officials-say/2013/04/23/324b9cea-ac29-11e2-b6fd-ba6f5f26d70e_story.html?utm_term=.15df5daf7f80) by the war in Afghanistan.
1.3.3. Pro: The US needs its strategic position in Afghanistan to fight terror groups in Pakistan.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Many militant groups that are threats to the United States and the broader international community [operate](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/09/05/the-case-for-continued-u-s-involvement-in-afghanistan/) from within tribal parts of Pakistan. These regions are in drone and commando range of US forces in Afghanistan. Thus, a continued fight against these groups has relied on US military presence in Afghanistan.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: The Federally Administered Tribal Areas are home operations only to [regional insurgency groups](http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/pakistan/terroristoutfits/group_list.htm) who oppose the established governments in that region. These groups historically have not presented a global threat, and have made no indications that their objectives have evolved to include global aims.
1.3.3.1.2.1. Con: Afghanistan faces a continuing threat from as many as 20 insurgent and terrorist networks present or operating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. These include branches of ISIS and Al-Qaeda, both of whom pose direct threats to the US \([DOD, P.1](https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/June_2017_1225_Report_to_Congress.pdf)\).
1.3.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Under Obama in 2016, the US withheld [$300 million](https://www.dawn.com/news/1275335) to Pakistan after Defense Secretary Ash Carter found he couldn’t certify that enough action had been taken against the Haqqani Network, which has been blamed for attacks on the US and NATO forces.
1.3.3.1.3. Con: The groups that operate out of the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan were originally [armed, trained, and supported](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/who-is-responsible-for-the-taliban) by the United States during the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. They are only regional actors and one-time surrogates for the United States.
1.3.3.1.3.1. Con: The fact that weapons from the United States eventually made it into these individuals hands does not diminish their threat level.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Many Pakistani military forces currently covertly support militant groups in Afghanistan and in other countries. The US's withdrawal would [embolden](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/09/05/the-case-for-continued-u-s-involvement-in-afghanistan/) these generals, convincing them that supporting violent groups against their enemies is an effective strategy.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: A Pakistan that is increasingly likely to support militant groups has major impacts in India, where it already [supports](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-politics-militants/pakistan-army-pushed-political-role-for-militant-linked-groups-idUSKCN1BR02F) militant groups. This support is likely to [increase](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/09/05/the-case-for-continued-u-s-involvement-in-afghanistan/) with increasingly emboldened generals.
1.3.3.3. Con: The US has now had a prolonged, enduring presence in Afghanistan and still hasn't effectively combatted terrorism in Pakistan. Instead, the semi-covert cross-border operations \(including [drone strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan) and [covert raids](https://www.thenation.com/article/secret-us-war-pakistan/)\) have consistently had [disproportionate impact](http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/pakistani) on non-combatant \(civilian\) population, and has bolstered support for anti-US organizations.
1.3.4. Pro: It is in the best interests of the US to increase global stability by combating terrorism.
1.3.4.1. Pro: As the world's largest economy, the US has the most to gain by maximizing possible trade partners and keeping shipping lanes safe.
1.3.4.2. Con: Violating the [sovereignty](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sovereignty/) of another country out of self-interest is illegitimate.
1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.4. Con: The US and NATO have a moral responsibility to assist in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan.
1.4.1. Pro: The US and NATO toppled the previous stable order in the 2001 invasion.
1.4.2. Pro: Western development aid is only possible with NATO military backing.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Western humanitarian groups have a [high](https://www.irinnews.org/news/2018/02/08/afghan-attacks-force-aid-rethink-leave-local-ngos-more-exposed) security risk from violent groups on the ground.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: The Taliban's official policy on foreign aid is that it supports the work of NGOs and foreign aid organizations so long as they meet several conditions and agree to work with the [Taliban](https://odihpn.org/magazine/taliban-policy-and-perceptions-towards-aid-agencies-in-afghanistan/). This means it would still be possible for NGOs to operate so long as they worked within the bounds set by the Taliban.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: This still severely restricts the scope of assistance that may be provided to the citizens of Afghanistan.
1.4.2.1.1.2. Con: Two NGOs affected, the [Red Cross](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/afghanistan-icrc-reduces-its-presence-country) and [Save the Children](https://www.irinnews.org/news/2018/02/08/afghan-attacks-force-aid-rethink-leave-local-ngos-more-exposed), were acting in that capacity and were still the target of attacks.
1.4.2.1.1.3. Con: The Taliban's conditions include 'neutrality requirements' that would prevent many major NGOs from operating.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Foreign aid can only be accepted by a somewhat friendly government. The collapse of the current regime and replacement with the Taliban would likely mean the end of humanitarian aid.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.4.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.1.1.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: The Taliban's policy towards [foreign aid](https://odihpn.org/magazine/taliban-policy-and-perceptions-towards-aid-agencies-in-afghanistan/) is that it is acceptable so long as it comes from neutral parties.
1.4.2.3. Con: -> See 1.4.2.2.3.
1.4.2.4. Con: Foreign Aid does not require a continued US or NATO presence in Afghanistan.
1.4.2.4.1. Pro: The West distributes aid in many countries in which it does not have a military presence, often [via the UN](http://www.un.org/en/sections/what-we-do/deliver-humanitarian-aid/).
1.4.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.3.
1.4.2.4.3. Pro: The Taliban is likely to be more receptive to Foreign Aid when it isn't accompanied by occupation by US and NATO forces.
1.4.3. Con: The US has already spent over [$100 billion](https://thediplomat.com/2016/05/afghanistans-addiction-to-foreign-aid/) in aid for Afghanistan and the development it has resulted in is relatively small and is occurring at too slow a rate for Afghanistan to catch up to the rest of the developing world.
1.4.3.1. Con: Rapid development allowing Afghanistan to catch up with the developed world in the near future is an unrealistic and unfair standard to put on US/NATO state assistance programs.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Afghanistan is one of the [poorest](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/which-are-the-poorest-countries-in-the-world/) countries in the world.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Afghanistan has been essentially in a constant state of war during the time period this aid has been distributed.
1.4.3.2. Con: The US has many demonstrated successes in the development of Afghanistan.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: The US has helped Afghanistan develop its green infrastructure.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: Seven alternative energy technologies were introduced, and 1,553 installations were [completed](https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N677.pdf) by USAID funded Afghan Clean Energy Project \(ACEP\).
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: USAID has strengthened Afghanistan's electrical infrastructure significantly.
1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: USAID [supported](https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/infrastructure) the construction of a 400-kilometer transmission line between Ghazni and Kandahar to extend the national electrical grid to southern Afghanistan.
1.4.3.2.2.2. Pro: USAID helped to [fund](https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/infrastructure) the upgrade of the the Kajaki Power Plant. This increased its generation potential to 51.5 megawatts in 2016, and assumed full operations of the plant in 2017, providing access to cheaper and more reliable electricity in Helmand and Kandahar.
1.4.3.2.2.3. Pro: In 2002, [only six percent](https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/infrastructure) of Afghans had access to reliable electricity. Today approximately 30% of Afghanistan has access to reliable electricity.
1.4.3.2.3. Pro: USAID has developed Afghanistan's road infrastructure.
1.4.3.2.3.1. Pro: USAID has invested in the construction and rehabilitation of more than [2,000 kilometers \(km\)](https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/infrastructure) of roads to propel travel and commerce.
1.4.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: This includes the [Ring Road](https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/infrastructure), one of the most significant economic linking networks in Afghanistan, which connects the country’s five major cities: Herat, Kabul, Kandahar City, Jalalabad, and Mazar-e-Sharif. More than 80 percent of Afghans now live within 50 km of the Ring Road.
1.4.3.2.4. Pro: USAID has [supported](https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/infrastructure) the design and construction of hundreds of hospitals, clinics, midwife and teacher-training centers, high schools, university residences and government office buildings across Afghanistan.
1.4.3.2.4.1. Con: The Afghan Ministry of Education has artificially [inflated](https://news.vice.com/article/millions-of-us-dollars-may-have-gone-to-ghost-schools-in-afghanistan) the number of schools built with USAID funds. [769 million](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/special%20projects/SIGAR-15-62-SP.pdf) USD worth of taxpayer dollars have been called into question as contributing to nonexistent "ghost schools."
1.4.3.2.5. Pro: USAID has invested heavily in the development of proper water infrastructure in Afghanistan.
1.4.3.2.5.1. Pro: The Afghan government and USAID [constructed](https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/infrastructure) more than 3,000 wells, primarily in rural communities, to provide reliable clean water for the first time to more than 863,000 Afghans, and nearly 42,000 latrines to prevent the spread of disease.
1.4.3.2.5.2. Pro: USAID, in [partnership](https://www.usaid.gov/afghanistan/infrastructure) with the governments of Afghanistan, Germany, and France, is building water infrastructure to improve the water quality and supply for Kabul residents.
1.4.3.2.6. Pro: Kabul is one of the world's [fastest growing](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/11/kabul-afghanistan-fifth-fastest-growing-city-world-rapid-urbanisation) cities in large part due to US/NATO defense and investment.
1.4.3.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.1.1.
1.4.3.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.5.2.
1.4.3.2.7. Con: US aid to Afghanistan has been [ineffectively](https://news.vice.com/article/us-aid-to-afghanistan-has-largely-been-wasted-and-stolen-report-says) distributed.
1.4.3.2.7.1. Pro: Many officials do not have the knowledge to spend US aid [wisely](https://news.vice.com/article/us-aid-to-afghanistan-has-largely-been-wasted-and-stolen-report-says).
1.4.3.2.7.2. Pro: Many jobs [created](https://news.vice.com/article/us-aid-to-afghanistan-has-largely-been-wasted-and-stolen-report-says) by the US are short term contract jobs as opposed to long term jobs for the Afghan economy.
1.4.3.2.7.2.1. Pro: "More than 80 percent of aid has been spent on short-term projects that seek to improve the security situation. Long-term capacity building and initiatives to strengthen the domestic economy were largely excluded from the list of priorities. It is for this reason that after 14 years the Afghanistan economy is still not self-sustaining and the country remains one of the most aid-dependent in the world." \([thediplomat.com](https://thediplomat.com/2016/10/the-failure-of-foreign-aid-in-afghanistan/)\)
1.4.3.2.7.3. Pro: Foreign aid disproportionately targets conflict regions leaving secure regions of Afghanistan to [miss out](https://thediplomat.com/2016/10/the-failure-of-foreign-aid-in-afghanistan/).
1.4.3.2.7.3.1. Con: Distributing aid to conflict regions is an efficient use of resources as it tends to be these regions which require the most support.
1.4.3.2.7.4. Pro: There is a significant evidence to suggest that [substantial parts of aid](https://thediplomat.com/2016/10/the-failure-of-foreign-aid-in-afghanistan/) went to local warlords and even found its way into the hands of the Taliban.
1.4.3.2.7.5. Con: Ineffective distribution of aid is better than ceasing to give aid, or being unable to ensure it is distributed as intended because there is no ground presence.
1.4.3.2.7.6. Pro: The US has [given](https://news.vice.com/article/us-aid-to-afghanistan-has-largely-been-wasted-and-stolen-report-says) corrupt Afghan leaders and kleptocrats too much money, sustaining their positions in society.
1.4.3.2.7.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.4.1.
1.4.4. Pro: Helping the Afghan people to make their own lives and country better is an inherent good.
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.
1.4.5. Con: The West does not have a monopoly on foreign aid or helping countries develop. Given they are a problematic actor in Afghanistan that [angers](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/taliban-open-letter-trump-urges-leave-afghan-170815052154246.html) large portions of the population, it would make more sense to allow other actors to take up this mantle.
1.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.4.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.4.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.4.5.4. Con: Even if other countries also provide Afghanistan with Foreign Aid, the loss of US Aid still leaves the country worse off.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: Once the US withdraws foreign aid from Afghanistan, competing actors like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and China, would see a vacuum that they could fill in order to have increased influence in the region, thus leaving Afghanistan with similar amounts of development aid.
1.4.5.4.1.1. Con: Current US foreign aid forces other actors who want influence in the region to compete for said influence raising the overall amount of foreign aid being given to Afghanistan.
1.4.6. Pro: Foreign aid/assistance can fight terrorism, keeping individuals safe.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Foreign assistance can [help](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/to-fight-terror-increase-foreign-aid/) friendly states develop the law-enforcement capabilities they need to track and capture terrorists in their midst.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Foreign assistance can be used to [teach farmers](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/to-fight-terror-increase-foreign-aid/) to become more productive, so that fewer people will starve and be radicalized.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Foreign aid can help promote a positive image of the West, making individuals less inclined to be radicalized towards violence against the West.
1.4.6.4. Con: Foreign aid and assistance probably "can" fight terrorism, but it is hard for the US to not radicalize individuals while they are occupying their land and killing their people.
1.4.6.5. Pro: Foreign aid and assistance can also give people a [stake](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/to-fight-terror-increase-foreign-aid/) in the global economy and can create common interests with us and a reason to work together.
1.4.6.6. Con: Many Afghan people believe that aid is distributed unfairly, going only to those with connections, and that the aid they receive is insufficient to meet their basic needs. [\(OECD Report, p.3\)](http://groundtruthsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/OECD_Afghanistan_affected-people-field-staff-survey.pdf)
1.4.6.6.1. Pro: Many people find it necessary to offer [bribes](https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-perception-of-ngos-in-afghanistan-isn-t-great-here-s-how-to-make-it-better-91299) or favours in order to access aid in Afghanistan.
1.4.6.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.7.6.
1.4.7. Con: Trump's [disavowal](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/21/545044232/trump-expected-to-order-4-000-more-troops-to-afghanistan) of "Nation Building" in his Afghanistan policy means that this foreign aid is unlikely to continue even if the US and NATO do not withdraw.
1.5. Pro: The war in Afghanistan cannot be won; it is best for Western forces to admit defeat and withdraw.
1.5.1. Con: The Taliban's unpopularity means it is possible to defeat them.
1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.9.1.
1.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.9.5.
1.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.4.3.
1.5.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.9.3.
1.5.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.9.4.
1.5.2. Pro: There is no known condition for a Western "victory" in Afghanistan.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Even ending the Taliban's control of territory would not guarantee a safer Afghanistan.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: The [success](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/10/29/how-we-won-in-iraq/) of the 2007 Iraq surge led to future ISIS leaders [meeting in prison](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/11/17/why-surge-iraq-actually-failed-and-what-that-means-today/0NaI9JrbtSs1pAZvgzGtaL/story.html), who would later use the instability caused since the 2003 invasion to control [almost half of Iraq](http://uk.businessinsider.com/maps-of-isis-territory-2014-2017-10), which necessitated US re-involvement in the conflict.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: A stalemate is [better](https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/better-stalemate-defeat-afghanistan) than a withdrawal in Afghanistan. Merely keeping the government in power is a victory for the US. This keeps the Taliban marginalized and less capable.
1.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.5.1.
1.5.2.2. Con: The victory condition is to establish a self-sufficient and stable democratic government.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: It is unlikely the West would accept a stable self-sufficient democratic government as a victory unless it were of a staunchly pro-US outlook.
1.5.2.3. Pro: The US has yet to establish a viable strategic end state in Afghanistan so continued military action is unwarranted.
1.5.2.4. Pro: The argument that a surge in troops will [end the stalemate](https://breakingdefense.com/2017/05/afghans-want-troops-show-us-results/) was made before the military efforts of 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2014: constant military efforts have ended in the resumption of a similar situation afterwards.
1.5.3. Pro: There have been broad geopolitical shifts in the region since 2001. The relative capabilities of the United States and the region have since changed and the US no longer has the edge that it once did.
1.5.3.1. Pro: In 2001, the United States had over [four times](https://warontherocks.com/2017/04/its-much-bigger-than-afghanistan-u-s-strategy-for-a-transformed-region/) the resources of the regional powers \(Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, China, Iran and Russia\) and the combined GDP of all regional powers equaled 24 percent of the US economy. By 2016, those regional economies had reached 84 percent of the US economy and the U.S. preponderance was reduced to near parity.
1.5.3.2. Con: The US [remains](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-most-powerful-militaries-2017-3) the strongest military power in the world.
1.5.4. Pro: Even if the war is winnable, the peace is not. Unless there is a buy in from all the tribes and a sharing of power in the country it will most likely devolve into yet another war. The US needs to remove its troops from Afghanistan, realizing there is not a "Western military solution" to this war.
1.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.5.5. Pro: History has demonstrated, repeatedly, that any attempt to occupy and 'modernize' Afghanistan will result in failure. The Soviet Union learned this lesson, and now the US/NATO will.
1.5.5.1. Pro: US strategic objectives are significantly [more ambitious](https://www.counterpunch.org/2010/12/08/the-russians-did-better-so-why-did-they-lose/) than the USSR's were.
1.5.5.2. Pro: The mujahideen defeated Soviet forces because they were able to embed within the local population, [much as the](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/18/afghan-war-soviet-invasion-mistakes) Taliban have done.
1.5.6. Con: Maintaining an Afghan government free of Taliban control is an objective worth fighting for.
1.5.6.1. Pro: The Taliban pose a threat to Western security, and therefore the cost is justified.
1.5.6.1.1. Pro: The Taliban [gave sanctuary](https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/is-the-taliban-still-a-threat-to-us-security/) to Osama Bin Laden in the past, and use [jihadi rhetoric](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2008/04/AP_BOOK/EN/index.htm) similar to that of other Islamist terrorist groups: their links to global jihad are an existential threat to the West.
1.5.6.1.2. Con: Even if those who believe the Taliban to be complicit in 9/11 are correct, the Taliban have not supported a mass terror attack against the West post-9/11.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Lives of Afghan citizens under the Taliban would [be severely restricted](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/03/taliban-sharia-pakistan), including violations of their human rights.
1.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.3.
1.5.8. Pro: Significant barriers remain in establishing an effective, inclusive and transparent government.
1.5.8.1. Pro: [Corruption](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/spotlight/2017_High-Risk_List.pdf#page=24) has eroded the legitimacy of the Afghan government, limiting its effectiveness and bolstering support for the opposing insurgency.
1.5.8.2. Pro: There are many challenges to reconstruction in Afghanistan.
1.5.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.9.5.1.1.
1.5.8.2.2. Pro: The US has invested heavily in the Afghan health sector, development projects, the energy sector, road construction, trade-facilitation programs and in building up of the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces \(ANDSF\). The Afghan government, by itself, [cannot sustain](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/spotlight/2017_High-Risk_List.pdf#page=30) many of these investments.
1.5.8.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.2.1.
1.5.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.5.8.4. Pro: Afghanistan’s economy still cannot support itself. In any given year, foreign military and aid accounts for about [95 percent of total GDP](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/09/the-afghan-war-economy-collapses/). This means that Afghan security is unsustainable without US taxpayers funding a significant portion.
1.5.8.4.1. Con: Economic support would still be provided by the West, even without any military presence.
1.5.8.4.1.1. Con: Much of the economic activity in Afghanistan occurs [because of the presence](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/09/the-afghan-war-economy-collapses/) of US military bases, as the military economy depends on local services, including construction, supply of food and fuel, trucking, etc.
1.6. Pro: Western forces are harming the country more than they are helping to protect and rebuild it.
1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.6.2. Pro: As long as coalition forces are [present](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/opinion/america-afghanistan-taliban-talks.html) on Afghan soil, the Taliban will [refuse](https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/fruitless-or-a-breakthrough-making-sense-of-ashraf-ghanis-peace-offer-to-the-taliban/) to negotiate or work towards peace. Western forces are themselves the cause of prolonged conflict.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.2.
1.6.4. Pro: The war in Afghanistan has made the lives of Afghan civilians worse.
1.6.4.1. Pro: As of August 2016, over [31,000](http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/afghan) Afghan civilians had been killed in the war.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: US drone strikes have killed scores of civilians instead of terrorists in Afghanistan. According to [documents](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drone-papers_us_561ed361e4b0c5a1ce61f463), nearly 90 percent of the people killed in airstrikes were not the intended targets during one five-month period of [Operation Haymaker](https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201510171028656925-afghanistan-drone-strikes-us-haymaker/) in northeastern Afghanistan in 2012.
1.6.4.2. Pro: The war has ruined the country's [water](https://www.thethirdpole.net/2016/10/24/afghanistans-coming-water-crisis/) infrastructure, leaving many without access to clean water.
1.6.4.3. Con: -> See 1.5.6.2.
1.6.4.4. Pro: More than one million Afghan civilians have been [displaced](https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/02/afghan-refugee-crisis-2016) within the country as of 2016.
1.6.4.5. Pro: In 2012, [some 800,000](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16722788) Afghans were estimated to have become disabled due to the war. Once disabled, [less than 30 percent](http://www.irinnews.org/report/75645/afghanistan-disabled-people-have-tough-time-lack-education-jobs) are able to find work, leaving them with great financial hardships.
1.6.5. Pro: Afghanistan should be an independent country ruled without any external power's interest. The only thing that bothers the peace and stability of one country is the involvement of different actors in their domestic affairs.
1.6.6. Pro: A US military presence in Afghanistan [motivates](https://warontherocks.com/2017/04/its-much-bigger-than-afghanistan-u-s-strategy-for-a-transformed-region/) regional neighbours such as Pakistan, Iran and Russia to support insurgents to pressure the US into leaving so that they gain a stronger foothold in the region.
1.6.6.1. Con: Even without Western intervention, Pakistan, Iran and Russia all wish to increase their presence in the region, and so would still use factional tactics to increase their influence.
1.7. Con: President Trump's new Afghanistan policy has potential to succeed. Western forces should not disengage from Afghanistan until the policy is seen to its fruition.
1.7.1. Con: Iran's influence is [increasing](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/05/world/asia/iran-afghanistan-taliban.html) in Afghanistan, making it a key player in achieving peace in the region. Yet Trump, instead of bringing Iran to the table, has adopted a [far more aggressive stance](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-chooses-sledgehammer-over-obamas-scalpel-iran-protests-771528) towards the country than his predecessor, ensuring Iran's disruptive behaviour in the country will continue.
1.7.2. Con: President Trump has significantly deemphasised the importance of governance and nation building in Afghanistan. Without such work, any gains made by the US military will ultimately be short term \([Felbab-Brown, p. 2](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/afghanistan_hopes_pitfalls.pdf)\).
1.7.2.1. Pro: Without a focus on governance, [systemic corruption and patronage](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/16/in-afghanistan-reform-cant-come-fast-enough-ghani/) within Afghanistan will remain, undermining the effectiveness of government.
1.7.2.2. Con: The American electorate is tired of the Afghanistan war. The only way Trump could sell a troop increase was by de-emphasising nation building and painting the war as '[killing terrorists](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/foreign-policy/347610-trump-gets-counterterrorism-strategy-right-on-afghanistan)'. Trump's political play has ensured that more troops will remain committed to Afghanistan.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: Many other respondents [answered](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015d-c4ac-dd39-a75d-cfbfbc3e0002) that they "don't know", showing that many American's simply aren't following America's longest war.
1.7.2.2.2. Pro: Polls [suggest](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015d-c4ac-dd39-a75d-cfbfbc3e0002) that more Americans think the United States is losing in Afghanistan and favour reducing US involvement than the number that think the US is winning.
1.7.2.3. Pro: The US often acts as a power broker between various parties in the Afghanistan conflict, by either [pressuring](https://www.rferl.org/a/us-alice-wells-calls-on-afghan-taliban-take-ghani-peace-offer-seriously-tashkent-talks/29081897.html) sides to come to the negotiating table or [facilitating](https://thediplomat.com/2016/10/spoilers-and-peace-in-afghanistan-negotiating-with-the-taliban/) the negotiations themselves. By removing itself from peacekeeping roles, the likelihood of peace decreases.
1.7.3. Con: Trump has [discussed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/world/asia/afghanistan-trump-mineral-deposits.html) mineral despots in Afghanistan with the latter's president as a possible reason to continue US military engagement in the country. This has led to Taliban propaganda that the US is simply in the country to steal its mineral resources, propaganda that has considerable traction with the local populace \([Felbab-Brown, p. 12](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/afghanistan_hopes_pitfalls.pdf)\).
1.7.4. Pro: Rather than setting an arbitrary deadline for withdrawal of all forces, Trump has correctly [adopted a conditions based approach](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/foreign-policy/347610-trump-gets-counterterrorism-strategy-right-on-afghanistan) to Afghanistan.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Obama's announcement of a withdrawal date only [encouraged](https://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0825/134812-afghanistan/) the Taliban, as they simply had to wait out the US military before taking control of the country. An indefinite stay makes it clear to the Taliban that they won't win any time soon, if at all.
1.7.4.2. Pro: The Trump administration's new [aim](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/23/596529860/as-fighting-season-begins-in-afghanistan-trump-administration-aims-for-peace-tal) is to force Taliban fighters to sit down to peace talks with the Afghan President.
1.7.5. Pro: Trump has [refocused](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/01/trumps-afghan-strategy-could-actually-work/) military operations to aggressively target the Taliban, increasing the efficacy of US military operations.
1.7.5.1. Pro: During the first six months of the Trump administration, the US [dropped](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/07/17/u-s-airstrikes-in-afghanistan-are-at-levels-not-seen-since-obama-troop-surge/?utm_term=.fbe334115174) 1,634 munitions in Afghanistan, compared to 545 in all of 2016.
1.7.5.2. Pro: Previously, air strikes could only be conducted against the Taliban when they were proximate to, or in combat with, Afghan or US forces. Now air strikes can be conducted against the Taliban [no matter where they are](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/10/03/mattis-reveals-new-rules-of-engagement/), allowing the US military to target Taliban safe havens and training camps, preventing them from consolidating their gains.
1.7.5.3. Pro: U.S. advisers have been [dispersed](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/10/03/mattis-reveals-new-rules-of-engagement/) among the Afghan units that are closer to the enemy forces, where previously they were only working alongside the highest levels of Afghan forces. This provides more support and guidance to Afghan units actually engaged in combat, increasing their chances of success.
1.7.5.4. Con: The increased freedom provided to the US military carries [large risks](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/politics/rules-of-engagement-military-force-mattis.html) of substantially increasing civilian casualties.
1.7.5.5. Pro: At the very least, this has [streamlined the decision making process](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/24/politics/trump-pentagon-shift-war-power-military/index.html), speeding up decision making cycles and allowing the US military to respond in time to on the ground situations.
1.7.5.6. Con: As a result of this, the White House will have [less input](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/24/politics/trump-pentagon-shift-war-power-military/index.html) on military decisions that could have long term geopolitical implications in the Afghanistan war.
1.7.5.7. Pro: The Trump administration recently adopted aerial bombing as a counter-narcotics measure and conducted its [first ever](https://www.rs.nato.int/news-center/press-releases/2017/afghan--us-forces-launch-new-campaign-tbnetworks.aspx) series of air strikes against Taliban drug labs. The airstrikes have already had an impact on the Taliban.
1.7.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.3.
1.7.6. Pro: Trump has called for increased pressure on Pakistan, a [constant supporter](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/01/05/why-pakistan-supports-terrorist-groups-and-why-the-us-finds-it-so-hard-to-induce-change/) of the Afghan Taliban.
1.7.6.1. Con: Pakistan will never stop supporting the Haqqani network and other elements of the Afghan Taliban: they not only ensure Pakistan's influence in Afghanistan, any cut of or opposition will provoke these groups and lead to attacks against the Pakistani state \([Felbab-Brown, p. 9](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/afghanistan_hopes_pitfalls.pdf)\).
1.7.6.2. Con: America [needs](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-cias-maddening-relationship-with-pakistan) Pakistani intelligence to target terrorists. The more aggressive America is towards Pakistan, the less incentive the latter has to share security intelligence.
1.7.6.2.1. Con: The ISI \(the Pakistani intelligence service\) is part of the problem, given they [actively support](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-usa-isi/pakistans-isi-a-hidden-frustrating-power-for-u-s-idUSTRE69721Z20101008) the Taliban, meaning reliable intelligence on the Taliban's activities is unlikely to be forthcoming.
1.7.6.3. Con: Pakistan has actively [objected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/trumps-new-afghanistan-policy-has-pakistan-angry-and-alarmed/2017/08/29/40e2de88-8cb9-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html?utm_term=.6084f00054e6) to the Trump administration's approach, feeling scapegoated by it and believing it to be merely more of the same [failed strategy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/15/pakistan-asks-trump-to-help-fund-border-fence-with-afghanistan) that has already been implemented for over sixteen years.
1.7.6.4. Pro: Pakistan appear to be willing to assist in ending the war; their National Security Adviser Nasser Janjua accepted Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani's invitation to enter into [talks](https://www.voanews.com/a/top-pakistan-security-official-visit-afghanistan-talks/4302788.html) on bringing about an end to the war.
1.7.6.5. Con: The Trump administration's approach is unlikely to work and could instead lead to a complicated relationship with Pakistan. This is not in the USA’s interest.
1.7.6.5.1. Pro: Sour relations with Pakistan could lead to the US losing access to key supply routes used for the Afghanistan war and make the war [costlier](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/04/trumps-pakistan-action-could-raise-costs-of-afghan-war-analysts-say.html) to wage from an economic standpoint.
1.7.6.5.1.1. Pro: For the past 16 years the USA's military efforts in landlocked Afghanistan have been [dependent](https://warontherocks.com/2017/07/the-war-in-afghanistan-and-considerations-of-supply/) on transit through and especially overflight of [Pakistani territory](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/opinion/pakistan-trump-aid-engage.html). In the absence of cheaper, shorter and acceptable alternative routes, US dependence on Pakistani supply lines gives Islamabad an important leverage.
1.7.6.5.1.2. Pro: The more expensive alternative to Pakistani routes is the [Northern Distribution Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_logistics_in_the_Afghan_War#Northern_Distribution_Network) which crosses through the Central Asian republics and Russia and [links Afghanistan](https://foreignpolicymag.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/00bcc-ndn_afghanistan.jpg) with the Baltic and Caspian ports. The route through Central Asia is also [unreliable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-turns-to-other-routes-to-supply-afghan-war-as-relations-with-pakistan-fray/2011/06/30/AGfflYvH_story.html?utm_term=.1b5b0dcbdcf6) because it makes the US military dependent on [authoritarian](http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/12/06/northern-distribution-nightmare/) countries.
1.7.6.5.1.2.1. Pro: There are [two](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-turns-to-other-routes-to-supply-afghan-war-as-relations-with-pakistan-fray/2011/06/30/AGfflYvH_story.html?utm_term=.696bf994afac) significant limitations on what the Pentagon can ship through Central Asia. Supplies are generally restricted to food, water and construction material; ammunition, weapons and other “lethal” cargo are prohibited. The routes are also strictly one-way and nothing can be shipped back out of the war zone.
1.7.6.6. Pro: US security assistance to Islamabad was cut off after a critical [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/947802588174577664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Fdonald-trump-pakistan-tweet-protests-karachi-us-ambassador-summoned-islamabad%2F) by Donald Trump. This included [$255 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pakistan-aid/u-s-suspends-at-least-900-million-in-security-aid-to-pakistan-idUSKBN1ET2DX?il=0) in Foreign Military Financing and about $900 million in the Coalition Support Fund \(CSF\).
1.7.6.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.7.7. Con: Despite the announcement of a new strategy, 2018 has seen an [increase in violence](https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/what-explains-afghanistans-early-2018-surge-in-violence/) and a deterioration of the security situation. Both the Afghan Taliban and the Islamic State are carrying out deadly attacks at an increased scale.
1.7.7.1. Pro: According to a threat assessment by the U.S. intelligence community, the security situation in Afghanistan is likely to deteriorate further this year while the Afghan National Army continues to struggle against the insurgents, despite coalition support \([Coats, p. 22](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Testimonies/2018-ATA---Unclassified-SSCI.pdf)\).
1.7.8. Con: Trump's policy isn't substantially different from previous administration's policies, which had not produced success.
1.7.8.1. Pro: President Donald Trump’s new Afghanistan strategy- more troops, pressure on Pakistan and diplomatic outreach to the Taliban- relies on unsuccessful tactics his predecessors [have already tried](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-22/trump-leans-on-afghanistan-tactics-that-failed-under-bush-obama). [Obama](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/8/21/15821886/trump-afghanistan-strategy-pakistan-august-21-2017) had sent tens of thousands more American troops to Afghanistan and also pressured Pakistan to crack down on the terrorist safe havens inside its lawless border regions. There’s little reason to think Trump’s approach will produce better results.
1.7.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.2.1.1.
1.8. Pro: The costs to Western nations of the war in Afghanistan are far too high.
1.8.1. Pro: The financial cost of the Afghanistan war has been extremely high.
1.8.1.1. Pro: The war in Afghanistan has cost the US [$1.07 trillion](https://www.thebalance.com/cost-of-afghanistan-war-timeline-economic-impact-4122493).
1.8.1.2. Pro: In the US, the cost of veterans’ medical and disability payments over the next 40 years will be [more](https://www.thebalance.com/cost-of-afghanistan-war-timeline-economic-impact-4122493) than $1 trillion.
1.8.1.3. Pro: Over the next 40 years, the war in Afghanistan will [add](https://www.thebalance.com/cost-of-afghanistan-war-timeline-economic-impact-4122493) $7.9 trillion to US' debt.
1.8.1.4. Pro: Reconstructing Afghanistan has been the largest expenditure to rebuild a single country in the US' history. The US has spent more on Afghanistan’s reconstruction than it did on the [Marshall Plan](https://www.sigar.mil/pdf/quarterlyreports/2014-07-30qr.pdf#page=15) to rebuild Western Europe after World War II.
1.8.2. Pro: The war in Afghanistan has led to a high death-count of American and NATO soldiers over a prolonged period.
1.8.2.1. Pro: [3,546](http://icasualties.org/oef/) coalition troops have been killed since the beginning of the war.
1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.5.6.1.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.10. Pro: The Afghanistan war is unjust.
1.10.1. Pro: [Article 6 of the U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Six_of_the_United_States_Constitution) reads: "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land". The U.S. ratified the UN Charter treaty which came into effect on October 24, 1945. This would seem to mean that any war waged contrary to the UN charter would be illegal by rule of the U.S. Constitution.
1.10.1.1. Pro: The UN Security Council has [not given authorization](https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/06/25/did-911-justify-the-war-in-afghanistan/) for the invasion of Afghanistan, which is necessary in order for NATO to legally pursue Al Qaeda.
1.10.1.1.1. Pro: The US’ justification for war in relation to [Article 51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defence_in_international_law#Chapter_VII_of_the_United_Nations_Charter) of the UN Charter which deals with self-defense, namely that it had a right to the use of force against Afghanistan in retaliation for the 9/11 terrorist attacks, is unfounded and flawed.
1.10.1.1.1.1. Pro: The terrorist attacks on 9/11 were not carried out by one state \(Afghanistan\) acting aggressively against the US; they were the actions of a terrorist organization that had no direct links to the government of any state.
1.10.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The US believed that the Afghan government, then controlled by the Taliban, were sheltering Osama Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda members after the attacks, and were thus complicit in the attack.
1.10.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Despite the willingness of the Taliban to find a compromise and [handing over Osama bin Laden](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5) to a neutral country, the United States declined the offer and decided that war would be the only option. War was therefore a first resort, rather than [the last resort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory#Jus_ad_bellum).
1.10.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The United States' rejection of the Taliban's offer came in the context of a [long history](https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/202/41753.html) of failed diplomatic efforts to persuade the Taliban to rescind sanctuary for UBL. At the time the Taliban made the offer our bombing campaign was effective and their organization was in disarray. The US saw the Taliban's offer as brinkmanship and an attempt to regroup, nothing more.
1.10.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Taliban leader Mullah Omar [refused](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/02/international/taliban-again-refuses-to-turn-over-bin-laden.html) to turn over Osama bin Laden to international authorities.
1.10.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Even though the Taliban was the only form of government in Afghanistan at the time of the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan, Al Qaeda was not. Al Qaeda did not have the kind of influence and control that the Taliban did in Afghanistan, so invading the country in order to eradicate them could be seen in a legal context as disproportionate and therefore [illegitimate](https://www.globalresearch.ca/legal-or-illegal-the-2001-us-british-attack-on-afghanistan-never-got-the-u-n-green-light/5377115).
1.10.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.1.1.1.1.
1.10.2. Con: It is just to act to protect yourself.
1.10.2.1. Con: There is little reason to believe Al Qaeda were capable of another attack similar to 9/11. The invasion of Afghanistan was a disproportionate reaction.
1.10.2.1.1. Con: Al Qaeda were [responsible](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/30/world/al-qaeda-documents-london-bombings/index.html) for planning the 2005 bombings in London.
1.10.2.1.1.1. Con: [Anti-terror planning](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33388286) has significantly improved in the many years after the London bombings.
1.10.2.1.2. Con: Al Qaeda were responsible for the [Charlie Hebdo](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/01/al_qaeda_in_the_arab_2.php) shooting in 2015.
1.10.2.1.3. Pro: It is no longer possible to use planes as an attack vector.
1.10.2.1.3.1. Pro: Cockpit doors are reinforced and remain locked during flights which prevents hijackers from gaining control of a plane.
1.10.2.1.3.2. Pro: Changes have been made that make a repeat attack [unlikely](http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/10560/) including the creation of the TSA and DHS, the integration of the intelligence community and the deployment of air flight Marshalls.
1.10.2.1.3.3. Pro: Prior to 9/11 hijackings were treated as ransom negotiations - pilots and passengers were advised to cooperate with the hijackers until their release could be negotiated. Since 9/11, the threat of similar attacks means that pilots and passengers are now advised to [fight back](http://www.dw.com/en/aviation-security-expert-says-9-11-changed-nature-of-hijackings/a-2778273) against hijackers.
1.10.2.1.3.3.1. Pro: Passengers who fought back were able to regain control of the fourth plane [during 9/11](http://www.dw.com/en/aviation-security-expert-says-9-11-changed-nature-of-hijackings/a-2778273).
1.10.2.1.3.3.2. Pro: The US military is now authorized to shoot down hijacked planes.
1.10.2.1.4. Pro: There are very few attack vectors that could match the destructiveness of 9/11.
1.10.2.1.4.1. Pro: A similarly devastating attack would likely require chemical or nuclear weapons.
1.10.2.1.4.1.1. Pro: The resources necessary to produce or acquire such weapons precludes non-state actors from [acquiring](https://www.hoover.org/research/another-911-possible) them.
1.10.2.2. Con: The Taliban never attacked the US. The US went to war with them to flush out Al Qaeda which pushed them primarily into other countries.
1.10.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.1.1.1.1.
1.10.2.4. Con: -> See 1.10.1.1.1.1.
1.10.2.5. Con: It is unjust to cause harm to people who pose you no harm, even in your pursuit of protecting yourself from others.
1.10.2.5.1. Pro: Civilians in Afghanistan pose the US no threat but are harmed by the US "protecting itself" through the war in Afghanistan.
1.10.2.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.2.2.
1.10.4. Pro: The Afghanistan War violates the [Just War theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory).
1.10.4.1. Pro: Declaring war on the basis of one terrorist attack goes against the principles of [necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_necessity) and [proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_\(law\)#International_law) when looking to engage in war, even if a state is relying on self-defense as a justification for war.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: No war was legally declared against Afghanistan or terrorism in general. While the term "war" was used and Congress authorized spending for the operations in support of GWOT, no declaration of war was issued.
1.10.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.1.2.
1.10.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.1.1.1.2.
1.10.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.10.4.3. Pro: A legitimate declaration of war must be directed against a specific actor, and pursuant to set goals. Neither has ever been the case in the military actions in Afghanistan or the wider war against terrorism.
1.10.4.4. Pro: The US has achieved its only legitimate objectives in Afghanistan: the killing or capture of Osama Bin Laden and the destruction or dispersal of the [Al Qaeda organization in Afghanistan](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/al-qaeda-2017-slow-and-steady-wins-race). Continued occupation after completing our objectives is unjust.
1.10.4.4.1. Con: Legitimate objectives also includes the stability of the regime before the U.S. leaves. This would not be the case if the U.S. and NATO left today.
1.10.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.10.4.5. Pro: The [International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/afghanistan) is carrying out an investigation into suspected war crimes carried out by the US armed forces in Afghanistan.
1.10.4.5.1. Pro: The ICC can only conduct an investigation if they have sufficient reason to suspect that the alleged crimes being investigated happened.
1.10.4.5.2. Con: Investigation of a crime does not mean it has happened.
1.10.4.5.3. Con: War crimes carried out in the conduct of war does not render the entire war unjust.
1.10.4.5.3.1. Pro: The bombing of Dresden by Allied forces in World War II is considered by many to be a [war crime](https://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/2011/02/dresden-1945-an-allied-war-crime/), but does not mean resistance to Nazi Germany was illegitimate.
1.10.4.6. Con: The morality of the war in Afghanistan should be judged by whether it makes the world a safer place, not whether it meets philosophical criteria.
1.10.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.10.4.6.2. Con: International relations should not be predicated on a consequentialist outlook.
1.10.4.6.2.1. Pro: Even if the invasion of Afghanistan was of net benefit to the world, it is still unjust because it violates the sovereignty of another nation.
1.10.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.10.4.6.2.2. Con: 'International law' and the 'rules-based order' are [frequently ignored](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/sorry-folks-there-no-rules-based-world-order-17497) by countries in pursuit of their own aims. There is no system that governs international relations that is not consequentialist.
1.10.4.6.2.3. Pro: Countries are amoral actors who are motivated only by self-interest.
1.10.4.6.2.3.1. Con: Just because many countries currently act selfishly is not a justification for them doing so. They have an obligation to pursue just policies and outcomes.
1.10.4.6.2.3.1.1. Con: The primary obligation of a country is to look after the best interest of its citizens even if that is at the expense of the citizens of other countries.
1.10.4.6.2.4. Con: Given that it is arbitrary where any individual is born, the fairest way to operate is to attempt to maximise utility across the world.
1.10.4.6.3. Pro: If the Afghanistan war is able to make the lives of future Afghans better, and save more lives in the long-term, then it is justifiable \([Sanders, p.14](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/Why%20the%20Numbers%20Should%20Sometimes%20Count%20-%20John%20T.%20Sanders.pdf)\).
1.10.4.6.4. Con: The US and NATO have no duty to make the world a better place, their duty is to protect US and NATO interests.
1.10.5. Pro: The Afghanistan War violates international law.
1.10.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.1.
1.10.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.4.5.
