Discussion Title: Should Dogs Be Banned In Cities?

1. Owning dogs should be banned in cities
1.1. Pro: Dogs need more freedom to roam.
1.1.1. Con: Dogs have been bred to live alongside humans; they are happiest when they can be close to humans.
1.1.2. Pro: Dogs don't have the space they need in cities.
1.1.2.1. Con: There are rarely cities the lack green spaces which create plenty of space to walk dogs. [Many toy breeds can require as little as half an hour a day.](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/Default.aspx)
1.1.3. Pro: This is especially true for some dogs under certain circumstances outlined in the [Yellow Dog Project](http://www.theyellowdogproject.com/About.html), where spaces could be made in cities as educational and healing opportunities. Dogs could learn in time to integrate with people and humans can learn more humane methods to integrate Yellow Dogs into society \(or at least their niche of it\).
1.1.4. Con: Many free-ranging dogs like [village dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-ranging_dog#Village_dogs) or strays live close to and alongside humans, both in smaller villages and large cities.
1.2. Con: Dogs \(Pets in general\) have an positive impact on economy.
1.2.1. Con: This is totally unfair to families who already have dogs and live in the city. Banning dogs in cities would cause major economic hardship for these families.
1.3. Con: Not everyone needs to own a dog but it's essential that dogs are present in cities as they create positive connections between total strangers. [\@dogtime_community](http://www.dogtimecommunity.com)
1.4. Pro: Dogs make too much noise to be kept in city dwellings.
1.4.1. Con: This should be something to be decided privately by landlords and such.
1.4.2. Con: Dogs who bark excessively require training to address the habit.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Sometimes excessive barking can be related to [separation anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_anxiety_in_dogs), which can be lessened with consistent training.
1.4.3. Con: Cities are generally noisy, with streets, delivery trucks, general traffic, construction sites, children, etc., all in close proximity to living areas.
1.4.4. Con: Laws could be made to allow people to have dogs without it being a nuisance to people \(as dogs are beneficial for companionship in some situations that do not cause others harm\).
1.4.5. Pro: There are many cities that have dog noise ordinances in place due to the high level of dog barking complaints they receive.
1.5. Pro: In cities, dogs can pose a health risk.
1.5.1. Pro: Some people are allergic to them.
1.5.1.1. Con: The same argument could be used to ban anything that poses an allergenic risk. Peanuts for instance, which pose a much higher risk.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Peanuts are contained to certain areas, such as restaurants. Dogs are not.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: A rise in allergies caused by tree pollen has not resulted in cities cutting down more trees.
1.5.1.1.3. Pro: [Food allergens](https://www.livescience.com/20857-food-allergies-city-kids-rural.html) are more prevalent in city children. If dogs are to be banned for allergy reasons, it would stand that some foods would be banned as well. That they are not is reason to also not ban dogs.
1.5.1.1.4. Pro: [Large cities](http://www.ccaco.com/blog/mold-within-city-buildings-a-common-growing-issue-affecting-new-older-structures-alike-part3) are known to have older buildings infested with mold. This is a respiratory hazard for many people.
1.5.1.2. Con: There are many places within cities that do not allow dogs, including living spaces. A person with allergies should have no problem in these spaces.
1.5.1.3. Con: People can take allergy medication to reduce their reaction to dogs, the same as they take medication for any other allergen they encounter.
1.5.1.4. Pro: [Thirty percent](https://www.filtrete.com/3M/en_US/filtrete/home-tips/full-story/?storyid=974e37a7-71ff-464c-969c-9539d365ce49) of people have allergic reactions to dogs and cats.
1.5.2. Pro: Dogs make people more fearful to the point it affects people's health.
1.5.2.1. Pro: One of the reasons that would make people fearful is when walking in the city, people may get into shock from a dog running out at them or hopping a fence.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: This is not unique to cities. Dogs can get loose from anywhere.
1.5.2.2. Pro: People may be upset with dogs so much that it'll make them either move out of a city or not move to the city to begin with. To make cities more attractive to live in, banning dogs makes sense.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: There are many people attracted to cities because they are dog-friendly. Banning dogs are likely to deter them all together.
1.5.2.3. Pro: Being fearful of dogs affects people's health through stress, less capability to exercise, and possibly getting injured by dogs.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: Being afraid clouds decision making, causing them to put themselves at risk by making mistakes that place them in the path of injury.
1.5.2.4. Con: This is arguably a very small minority of people, banning dogs as a result of this would be akin to banning open spaces in order to aid agoraphobics.
1.5.2.5. Con: A much better way to solve this issue would be to focus resources on helping those effected overcome their phobia.
1.5.3. Pro: Some dogs relieve themselves on the pavements and areas where there is human traffic.
1.5.3.1. Con: Responsible dog owners clean up after their dogs. There are fines in place for people who do not clean up after their dogs.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: In many places where fines are not enforced, dog owners will leave excrement on the streets.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Some cities, such as [New York City](https://nypost.com/2017/05/05/de-blasio-pledges-crackdown-on-dog-poop/), threatens a fine of $250 for not picking up after one's dog\(s\).
1.5.3.2. Pro: Dog feces is a source of bacteria and diseases and should be avoided in urban environment.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: There are many source of bacteria in urban environments, the largest species that contribute to this are humans.
1.5.4. Con: Cities in general pose health risks due to the close proximity of humans in a small area. Dogs are not the only or biggest health risk here.
1.5.4.1. Con: Being not the only or the biggest risk does not diminish the risk. The fact that less people die or are injured by falling from high buildings that in car accidents is not a reason not to care installing protective nets.
1.6. Con: Dogs are necessary in cities for human well-being.
1.6.1. Pro: K9 units are important for the police forces.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Police dogs are protected under the [Federal Law Enforcement Animal Protection Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/1791), as they are recognized to serve communities like human officers.
1.6.2. Pro: Dogs keep people company - combating loneliness.
1.6.2.1. Con: Friendship and family, not dogs, should be the solution for loneliness.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: Some people do not have friends or family available. A dog can substitute this.
1.6.2.2. Pro: [Loneliness is a major issue in modern society.](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/surprising-effects-loneliness-health-depression-young-old-a8110581.html)
1.6.3. Con: There are numerous people that live happily in the cities without dogs.
1.6.4. Pro: Dogs can help disabled people to navigate the world better.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Dogs can even be medically necessary in some situations, either as a service dog or as an emotional support animal.
1.6.5. Pro: Dogs are a form of protection for people.
1.6.5.1. Con: Dogs are [hardly the best](http://24-7-home-security.com/guard-dogs-home-security/) means of protection in a modern city.
1.6.5.2. Pro: Overall, crime rates are [higher](http://victimsofcrime.org/docs/ncvrw2013/2013ncvrw_stats_urbanrural.pdf) in cities than in suburban or rural areas. Dogs can alert and protect against crime.
1.6.5.3. Con: There are other alternative forms of protection, such as alarm systems, cameras, and personal weapons.
1.6.5.3.1. Con: Allowing access to personal weapons also makes them more readily available to criminals.
1.6.5.3.2. Con: Other forms of alarms aren't as diverse as a dog. A dog is effectively an alarm and deterrent in one.
1.6.5.3.3. Con: Camera systems can be costly to purchase and maintain, where as dogs are often cheaper and they also provide a lot more diverse functionality.
1.6.5.3.3.1. Con: A properly fed and taken care of canine will be significantly more expensive than a camera over its lifetime.
1.7. Con: Only certain dog behavior should be banned. Dogs themselves ought not to be banned.
1.7.1. Pro: Dog breeds with a history of aggression should be considered for ban, not the entire species.
1.7.2. Con: Some negative, innate dog behaviors are hard to stop, even with training, such as [barking](http://www.laanimalservices.com/laws-policies/nuisance-barking/). Thus, dogs as a whole should be banned.
1.7.3. Con: Dogs should be banned by breed \(according to their environmental preference, like strictly indoor dogs are allowed, whilst outdoor dogs are not\), not by behavior to avoid problematic interactions.
1.7.3.1. Con: Banning dogs by breed is akin to banning people by race. Its generalizing discrimination, in which case good dogs are punished because of a few unruly ones.
1.7.3.2. Con: Banning by breed is discriminatory against responsible dog-owner's and their dog.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: Breed bans overlook irresponsible dog owners and places blame and consequence on the dog.
1.7.4. Pro: If pet owners can manage to train their pet appropriately to adapt to cities, then they do not need to be banned.
1.7.4.1. Con: Even with the best training, a dog could still act out-of-line. Thus it is better to remove the issue completely rather than trying to get dogs to fit in with society and it failing.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: The possibility of this happening is likely low with good training.
1.7.4.2. Con: The effectiveness of training becomes apparent only when a dog reaches a certain age, and can't be determined beforehand.
1.7.4.2.1. Con: [Training](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/puppy-behavior-and-training-training-basics) can begin very early on in a dog's life. While training may take stages, the effectiveness of each stage is quickly apparent before adulthood.
1.8. Con: Dogs live happily with humans and in harmony.
1.8.1. Pro: Dogs should have the [same rights](https://www.kialo.com/should-human-life-be-valued-above-animal-life-4148/4148.0=4148.1/=4148.1) as [humans](https://www.kialo.com/humans-are-fundamentally-different-from-other-animals-9265/9265.0=9265.1/=9265.1) in regards to being able/free to be wherever they want to be with no limitation.
1.8.1.1. Con: That would mean that cities and towns would be full of feral dogs that were not only dangerous but starving. Modern breeds do not have the tools or instincts to survive without human intervention.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Since animals are living beings, they should be given the same respect \(of liberty and "[utilitarian happiness](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-32854504)"\) as humans instead of resorting [speciesism](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-32854504).
1.8.1.3. Pro: For many people dogs are like human [children](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11542075/Why-humans-love-pet-dogs-as-much-as-their-children.html) who should be treated with the same rights and respects as humans.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.8.3. Con: Dogs pose [non-negligible treat](https://www.animals24-7.org/2018/01/08/57-dog-attack-deaths-645-disfigurements-in-2017-led-by-pit-bulls/) to human life and health.
1.8.4. Con: They can live with humans in harmony outside of the city.
1.8.5. Pro: Dogs are human's best friend.
1.8.5.1. Pro: Dogs are pack animals and see humans as part of their family.
1.9. Pro: Dogs are dangerous.
1.9.1. Con: Comparatively, [dogs pose a much lesser risk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States) \([81% of those bites cause no injury or minor injury](https://www.caninejournal.com/dog-bite-statistics/)\) than amenities like [cars for instance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year). The risk is so low it does not warrant a ban considering we don't ban amenities that pose a much higher risk.
1.9.2. Pro: Some dogs are aggressive and threaten people, they can be dangerous and are known to bite or even kill people.
1.9.2.1. Con: Aggression in dogs can be caused by training. [Aggressive methods](https://positively.com/articles/aggressive-training-breeds-aggressive-dogs/) will create aggressive dogs.
1.9.2.2. Con: [Deaths from dog bites are very rare.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/15/which-animal-kills-the-most-humans/)
1.9.2.3. Con: These are behavioural issues that can be solved through better training methods.
1.9.2.4. Pro: [Many dog breeds](https://www.cheatsheet.com/culture/this-is-the-most-commonly-banned-dog-breed-in-the-u-s.html/) have been banned from city living due to occurrences of reported aggression.
1.9.2.4.1. Con: These breeds are not inherently aggressive breeds.
1.9.2.4.2. Con: [Bans are lifting](https://people.com/pets/pit-bull-ban-lifted-anamosa-iowa/) for some of these breeds, such as the pitbulls, as lawmakers are finally taking notice that it isn't the breed but how they are trained \(like any dog\).
1.9.3. Con: Not all dogs are dangerous, in the same way not all humans are.
1.10. Con: Banning them would be unenforceable .
1.10.1. Pro: People might have pets in their homes and due to privacy, no one would find out if they are there or not.
1.10.2. Pro: Since people have rights with pet ownership, banning them might conflict with them.
1.10.3. Con: Dogs are often banned from city housing and certain areas where people dine. It is possible to enforce this in other places as well.
