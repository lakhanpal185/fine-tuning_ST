Discussion Title: The Iliad of Homer glorifies warfare

1. The Iliad of Homer glorifies warfare
1.1. Pro: [Alexander the Great](http://ancientheroespodcast.com/blog/did-alexander-the-great-really-idolize-achilles) made use of the Iliad for his conquests and aspired to live by it, especially Achilles.
1.2. Pro: The warrior class is the highest class of Greek and Trojan society, resting right below the King.
1.2.1. Con: The story is about war, so of course the only characters we are exposed to are warriors.
1.3. Pro: Common epithets associated with the best warriors are "great" and "brilliant", with very few honorable mentions given to non warriors.
1.3.1. Con: Warriors are literally the only characters mentioned extensively, save for the gods.
1.4. Con: The detailed descriptions of death and destruction make the negative affects of war seem not worthy of the potential benefits.
1.5. Con: Warfare in the ancient Mediterranean was more an element of the culture at the time, rather than an object of controversy.
1.5.1. Pro: Violence and warfare was commonplace for much of history. Only a modern context of the Iliad makes it violent.
1.6. Con: The failings of the warriors to live up to the warrior ideal may be an attempt to disenchant the audience with the idea of a perfect warrior.
1.7. Pro: Achilles literally states that his only reason for fighting in the war is for glory, and that he doesn't care about getting Helen back.
1.7.1. Con: Achilles is not the only character in the narrative, and arguably not the protagonist.
