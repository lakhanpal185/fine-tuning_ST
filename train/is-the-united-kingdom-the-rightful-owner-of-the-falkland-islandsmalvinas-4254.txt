Discussion Title: Is the United Kingdom the rightful owner of the Falkland Islands/Malvinas?

1. Is the United Kingdom the rightful owner of the Falkland Islands/Malvinas?
1.1. Pro: Britain respects the island's democracy even if it votes against British rule, whereas Argentina refuses to recognise the islanders while exploiting the issue as a distraction from domestic problems like the economy.
1.1.1. Pro: In the post-WW2 era, Britain has respected the wishes of multiple former-colonies; granting them independence rather than fighting over them.
1.1.1.1. Pro: This has certainly been the British position since the mid 1960s [hansard.millbanksystems.com](http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1966/dec/15/dependent-territories-independence)
1.1.2. Pro: Argentina does not seem to be afraid of accusations that it is colonialist; possibly due to the fact that it is a former colony and thus sees itself as being above accusations of imperialism or colonialism.
1.1.3. Pro: During a UN meeting, Argentina's president at the time \(Cristina Kirchner\) refused a hand-delivered invitation for dialogue from the islanders.
1.2. Con: The UK does not possess the military capabilities to defend the Falkland Islands as it doesn't posses functional aircraft carriers.
1.2.1. Pro: The ability to project military capabilities was key in defining the borders of empires or the behaviour of client, such as [Ancient Rome](http://www.liquisearch.com/military_of_ancient_rome/capabilities/power_projection) or [Imperial Spain](https://books.google.de/books?id=WhyPBHJV5VYC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=power+projection+and+ownership+of+land&source=bl&ots=FnhJsJlwtd&sig=U4wLRuIJMcre3itDEqPWFGQoQWI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6itm13_fWAhVhJcAKHd4QCSwQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=power%20projection%20and%20ownership%20of%20land&f=false).
1.2.2. Con: Argentina does not have the capabilities to challenge the UK as its air force is virtually [non-existing](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/argentina-has-just-3-years-invade-the-falklands-18964).
1.2.3. Pro: If the UK cannot protect the population of the Falkland Islands, every country could just take and de facto own a strip of land.
1.2.4. Con: Although not being combat-ready until 2020, the Royal Navy has two 70,000 tonne fleet carriers.
1.2.5. Con: The UK supported the islands [stationary defence](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2017/03/07/britain-beefs-up-defenses-in-the-falkland-islands/) with extensive ground-to-air defence capabilities.
1.2.6. Con: Even if no aircraft carriers are availible, the Royal Navy could still use its submarines to impliment an 'area denial' strategy.
1.2.7. Con: A military intervention by Argentina without a UN resolution would be diplomatically damaging to them and might damage their relations with the UK's allies.
1.2.8. Con: A military intervention by Argentina would be an expensive use of public funds, and probably cost lives and is therefore unlikely to happen under their current democratic political structure.
1.3. Con: Argentina continues to claim the Falklands as their territory.
1.3.1. Con: Denmark, Canada or any other country could also claim the Falklands as their territory, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the claims are justified.
1.3.1.1. Con: Only Argentina asserts legitimacy over the Malvinas in its [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_dispute#Constitution_of_Argentina).
1.3.1.2. Con: Only Argentina was willing to go to war over the Falkland Islands. Canada and Denmark, in contrast, settled with exchanging a bottle of whiskey in their dispute over the [Hans Islands](http://www.businessinsider.de/canada-and-denmark-whiskey-war-over-hans-island-2016-1?r=US&IR=T).
1.4. Pro: The islanders have consistently voted to stay British, exercising their right to self-determination.
1.4.1. Pro: 1,513 votes were in favour, compared to just 3 votes against.[bbc.co.uk](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21750909)
1.5. Con: International bodies judge the Falklands to be part of Argentina.
1.5.1. Pro: A [UN commission](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/29/falkland-islands-argentina-waters-rules-un-commission) decided that the Falkland Islands lie within Argentinian waters.
1.5.1.1. Con: The same UN commission accepted that there is still a question over the islands.
1.5.1.2. Con: This is simply not true. No UN organ has ever found that the Falklands lie within Argentine waters.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: The statement is not supported and the Guardian article used to support is not accurate - unless someone can show which outer limit points listed in the UN UNCLOS [recommendations](http://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/arg25_09/2016_03_11_COM_SUMREC_ARG.pdf) include the Falkland Islands.
1.5.2. Con: The UN Special Committee on Decolonization has merely asked for dialogue between the two sides, rather than making any explicit ruling on who owns the islands.  [un.org](https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/gacol3298.doc.htm)
1.6. Pro: Made in 1765, Britain's claim of ownership pre-dates any Argentine claim.
1.6.1. Pro: Argentina did not exist until the 1800's, and neither did its pre-independence ancestors make any known claims before the British one.
1.6.2. Con: Argentina did not exist until the 1800's and therefore could not make a claim at this time
1.6.2.1. Con: The pre-independence Argentines were native to Latin America or Spain, not the Falklands.
1.7. Con: The islands are close to Argentina, whereas London is thousands of miles away.
1.7.1. Con: The Falkland islanders and their semi-independent government are literally touching the islands, whereas Argentina is 300 miles away.
1.7.2. Con: Proximity alone is not a basis for ownership.
1.7.3. Con: That logic can work both ways; the Falkland Islands/Stanley could rule over Argentina because it's "close".
1.8. Con: Spain gave the islands to Argentina upon secession.
1.8.1. Con: As British territory, Spanish decisions are irrelevant.
1.8.2. Con: Spain did not give the Falklands to Argentina. Spain did not even recognize Argentina until 1857. How could Spain give something to a country it did not recognize?
1.8.3. Con: The accuracy of this claim is dubious because Spainâ€™s "gift" was indirectly implied rather than being explicitly offered.
