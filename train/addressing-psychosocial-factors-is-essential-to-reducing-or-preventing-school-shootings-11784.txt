Discussion Title: Addressing psychosocial factors is essential to reducing or preventing school shootings.

1. Addressing psychosocial factors is essential to preventing school shootings.
1.1. Pro: While gun control efforts alone may *limit* access to guns, it is impossible to prevent one from being obtained by a possible school shooter, either by legal or non-legal means.
1.2. Con: Many American school children suffer from psychosocial issues \(trauma, abuse, depression, etc\) but do not commit mass shootings.
1.2.1. Con: All mass shooters suffer from psychosocial issues, making these issues a key cause in mass shootings.

1.2.2. Con: Just because of that, it is very important to look for psychosocial factors that can predict much better who will become a person at risk for committing a horrific crime or not. It's not being depressive or so that predicts who will offend such a crime, but what is a better predictor, then. Therefore research is important!
1.3. Con: Addressing these factors deflects attention from the gun control narrative.
1.3.1. Con: Addressing gun control deflects attention from psychosocial factors. The way to deem which one of these is more important is to investigate both.
1.3.2. Pro: It is vital to realise that, psychosocial factors notwithstanding, without gun control other factors will never be sufficiently addressed.
1.4. Pro: "Research demonstrates that eighty percent of perpetrators... had been socially excluded and were seen as outcasts". [\[1\]](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1327&context=honors-theses)
1.5. Pro: "The Safe School Initiative report indicated that perpetrators in over three-fourths of the school shootings had either threatened or attempted suicide at some time in the recent past" [\[1\]](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1517/f7e01ce08f029082c3cd7b314b5f298293e2.pdf)
1.6. Con: These factors exist within other countries that do not have mass school shootings.
1.7. Con: Addressing these factors contributes to the stigma of the mentally ill being violent.
1.7.1. Pro: Indeed, a 2015 study found "no significant association between the rate of school and mass shootings and state prevalence of mental illness". It is patently incorrect to blame school shootings on mental health issues; it is, at best, one part of a complex of issues. \([p. 13](https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1327&context=honors-theses)\)
1.7.1.1. Con: Page 1 of this document, under "ABSTRACT", states the following...

"The motivations are most
commonly a combination of factors, which can include ... ...negative peer influences, and or/ experiences of abuse, rejection, bullying, and/or mental
illness"

Additionally, under "CONCLUSION", states: "A person might be more apt to commit a school shooting if they are currently, or have previously, experienced abuse, rejection, bullying, and/or mental illness"
1.7.2. Con: "Psychosocial factors" include mental illness, but are not limited to it. In addressing psychosocial factors, if we find that there is "no significant association between the rate of school and mass shootings and state prevalence of mental illness", then the mentally ill are saved from the stigma of violence, and the analysis is still open to other psychosocial factors that aren't categorized as mental illness.
1.8. Pro: If psychosocial factors are not addressed, a disturbed individual may utilize other weapons \(bombs, knives, etc\) to commit similar crimes \(see [Austin Serial Bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_serial_bombings)\)
1.9. Pro: Anyone who could commit such horrific crimes must be suffering from psychosocial factors such as trauma, abuse, depression, personality disorder, etc.
