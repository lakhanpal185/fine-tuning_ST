1.4.2. Pro: The [police and military](http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/04/20/uniformed-injustice-police-military-target-lgbt-salvadorans/) in El Salvador regularly and violently target those in the LGBTQ community, including such offenses as rape.
1.4.3. Pro: [Some police](http://latina-1051845746.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/lifestyle/our-issues/police-officers-asked-target-blacks-latinos-lgbtq) are told by their superiors to target members of the Black, Hispanic, and LGBTQ communities.
1.4.4. Pro: This has historically been the case in the US since long before the [the Stonewall riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots). Police targeted gay bars, and laws in some areas required some degree of conformity to gender roles in regards to dress.
