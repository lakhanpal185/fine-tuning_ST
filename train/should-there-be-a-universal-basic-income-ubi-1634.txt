Discussion Title: Should There be a Universal Basic Income (UBI)?

1. Wealthy countries should provide citizens with a universal basic income \(UBI\).
1.1. Pro: A UBI reduces crime.
1.1.1. Pro: Systems that already exist, [like child allowances payments](http://www.businessinsider.com/study-makes-strong-case-for-basic-income-for-kids-2016-12), are a first step towards a UBI, and they show that children who receive this allowance are less likely to grow up to commit crimes.
1.1.1.1. Con: Child allowances are not "a first step" towards UBI. Despite similarities, children’s labour is not needed for the economy so child allowances \(unless too high\) do not cause the vicious circle of economic output decline and increasing real poverty, like UBI.
1.1.1.2. Pro: In high crime areas [Cash for Criminals](https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/19/health/cash-for-criminals-richmond-california/index.html) programs have actually reduced crime by youth through using money as an incentive for not committing crime.
1.1.2. Con: A UBI attracts more illegal immigration.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Politically, a UBI might add to anti-immigration sentiments, as citizens will likely be concerned with immigrants taking advantage \(economic dependency\) of this system. This makes the lives of immigrants and perceived immigrants worse.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Immigration is a force for reducing global inequality. Reduced immigration is therefore a net harm because it harms the welfare of humanity as a whole and makes borders more rigid in general.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Migration and remittances increases the welfare of families who remain in their countries of origin. In [Guatemala](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152089), having a migrant relative is associated with improved child nutrition.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Migration increases job opportunities and access to productive inputs to improve the effectiveness of labour. Both of these factors increase income for migrants in destination countries. Therefore, reduced migration increases global labour market inequalities.
1.1.2.1.1.3. Con: This is dependent on the actual reduction of migration.
1.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: The United States would need 4 trillion a year to pay every citizen 15,000 a year. Adding 4 trillion a year to the national deficit would create inevitable desires to reduce immigration.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: UBI guaranteed to any citizen creates greater economical inequality between citizens and non-citizens, be it foreign students, refuges or other migrants
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: The cost of financing incomes for migrants is difficult to justify politically. This is likely to cause migrants to be treated like second class citizens who will be further neglected by the lack of social institutions.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Even if immigrants do not immediately receive a UBI, people are likely to be concerned about immigrants coming to access it eventually. This may cause countries to not accept immigrants when they are needed to provide labor.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: If someone comes to a new country to work, they will inevitably pay tax, therefore supporting the overall system, including a UBI. If that work finishes and they choose to remain, they should be  entitled to receive UBI themselves.
1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: UBI on a national level would create a very exclusive nationhood, and could cause strong differences between citizens and non-citizens living in a country. Freedom of movement could suffer as xenophobia for social envy would arise.
1.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: In many countries, plenty of political parties trade on the popular perception that governments favour immigrants over citizens. If immigrants receive the UBI, the resulting backlash would empower these parties to find new ways to reduce immigration or reduce the rights of immigrants in other areas.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Some of the largest causes for xenophobia and anti immigrant sentiment are related to economic anxiety or fearing the possibility of losing something. This is less true in a world where everyone is guaranteed some level of income regardless of immigration trends.
1.1.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Inequality is also supported by the [demonization](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/08/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review) and mischaracterisation of the poor by the middle and upper-classes. Those who do not lack opportunity and resources employ that tactic to maintain their superiority.
1.1.2.1.3.3. Pro: People in rich countries receive a citizenship rent which they are unwilling to share. Voters thus seek to create citizen-only benefits \(tax discrimination of migrants or immigration crackdowns\) to reduce the benefits of migration.
1.1.2.1.3.4. Con: A large percentage of immigrants would not be economically dependent on the UBI due to the realities of most immigration systems, which give preferences to migrants with wealth, high levels of education, etc.
1.1.2.1.3.4.1. Con: Economically dependent or not - once accepted as citizens those immigrants would receive a UBI as well.
1.1.2.1.3.5. Con: Even where some immigrants are dependent on the UBI \(refugees, asylum seekers\) the overwhelming majority of all UBI payments are directed to local citizens rather than incoming immigrants.
1.1.2.1.3.5.1. Con: Public perception will often overrule a careful consideration of the facts about the total number of immigrants receiving UBI payments. Even if only a few hundred immigrants receive the UBI, that could be enough to create a public outcry.
1.1.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.1.
1.1.2.1.5. Con: A UBI is not likely to lead to anti-immigrant sentiment because it ensures that opportunities exist for all individuals, not just immigrants.
1.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Xenophobia [is mainly fed by](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1089&context=edpsychpapers) a lack of economic resources and opportunity; thus a UBI will increase social cohesion.
1.1.2.1.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.2.1.1.
1.1.2.1.6. Con: Anti-immigrant sentiment will not occur because in order to gain the status of having a UBI, one needs to be registered either as a permanent resident or citizen of that government. Immigrants who do not pay taxes would not receive government benefits such as the UBI.
1.1.2.1.6.1. Con: Even if this is true, most immigrants strive to eventually achieve legal status, and subsequent citizenship benefits. This backlash still hurts them a lot.
1.1.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: For example, it likely harms efforts to grant visas and/or amnesty to illegal immigrants.
1.1.2.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: A UBI replacing current forms of welfare would make it harder for immigrants to become naturalized citizens.
1.1.2.1.7. Con: The economic benefits that migrants give by spending money in the system lead to far more benefits than their consumption of government expenditure costs.
1.1.2.1.7.1. Pro: Many undocumented workers pay tax despite not being eligible for many government assistance programs. On net they [contributed $12 billion to the US economy in 2010](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf).
1.1.2.1.7.2. Pro: Immigrants "[grease the wheels of the labor market by flowing into industries and areas where there is a relative need for workers](http://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/north-american-century/benefits-of-immigration-outweigh-costs.html)" and generate rises in income for both migrants and citizens.
1.1.2.1.8. Con: State dependency is contingent on the fact that these immigrants contribute nothing to the economy, which is false.
1.1.2.1.8.1. Pro: Once migrants have the chance to work, they would pay taxes as everybody else. In this sense, nobody could claim that they don't deserve a UBI.
1.1.2.1.8.1.1. Con: It does not matter whether or not immigrants contribute to the economy, it matters whether they are perceived as contributing to the economy. Many people hold anti-immigrant sentiments because they perceive immigrants as economic parasites.
1.1.2.1.8.2. Pro: The majority of [immigrants](http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/what-immigrants-say-about-life-united-states) have and value a 'strong work ethic', which often means they work long hours and many jobs. Even with a UBI, this work ethic is likely to continue.
1.1.2.1.9. Con: Most anti-immigrant sentiment comes from people who feel that their own economic security is threatened. If they did not have to worry about their own livelihood anymore, they would likely perceive other people living a decent life in their proximity as less of a threat.
1.1.2.2. Pro: In many countries being born in that country grants the child automatic citizenship. If that child then receives the UBI, it provides an incentive to immigrate illegally.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: UBI payments for children are typically set at approximately half of that of an adult. Even if a child receives a UBI payment, that is unlikely to be enough money to support the parents.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Historically, Europe has granted [citizenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli) by right of blood \(i.e. inherited by parents\) and America by birth, thus this is only applicable to North and South American countries as most countries allow citizenship by birth with restrictions, and several have increasingly changed policies due to immigration.
1.1.2.2.3. Con: This seems to be more an issue with how citizenship works.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Even if UBI payments are only available to citizens, this still provides an increased incentive to immigrate to countries with a UBI and in doing so start the pathway towards citizenship.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: This would be a bizarrely long gamble in most countries, where receiving citizenship post-illegal-immigration is exceptionally difficult and requires a substantial period of residence in the country if it is possible at all.
1.1.2.3.2. Con: These immigrants, if accepted, would provide valuable skills to our society.
1.1.2.4. Con: Eventually, UBI may be in place in every country, so there would not be such movement across borders due to economic migration.
1.1.2.4.1. Con: While UBI could work in the end game, getting there would be difficult as, at some point, only a few wealthy countries would have it, increasing the pressure on their immigration system to levels not seen in the modern era.
1.1.2.5. Con: Arguing this as a con presupposes that immigration automatically has a negative effect on society. Many people would disagree with this - for example, in the UK, migrants since 2000 have been found to contribute £1.34 in taxes for every £1 that migrants recieved in benefits, in addition to the labour they provide. Source: [fullfact.org](https://fullfact.org/immigration/do-eu-immigrants-contribute-134-every-1-they-receive/)
1.1.2.5.1. Con: That doesn't distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants. Furthermore, the situation in the UK, with wealthy Europe next door and no other near neighbours, is a "best case scenario" for immigration. The USA is next to poorer countries such as Mexico; Australia is next to poor Asian and Pacific states, etc.
1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: Poor immigrants do not necessarily have a negative effect on the society they migrate to. Before this is asserted, it needs to be backed up with data.
1.1.2.6. Con: When there is more economic stability among less wealthy people there will be less anger and anxiety directed towards immigrants and those with different cultures — the fear is often that those groups will take "their" houses and jobs. Reducing the cause of this antagonism will then reduce the stigma — and enhance the dignity — of immigrants.
1.1.2.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.2.6.2. Con: On the contrary, people might just as well  become more resentful of the hand that feeds them, as they are completely dependant on it.
1.1.2.7. Con: Only citizens would receive a UBI, so illegal immigrants do not have an additional incentive to immigrate.
1.1.2.7.1. Con: With a UBI, low-wage jobs will become less attractive to most citizens, attracting unprotected [immigrants](http://inequality.org/argument-universal-basic-income/) to do the hard labor, as in [Dubai](http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/middle-east/dubai-migrant-workers-the-hidden-slaves-behind-glamour-city/news-story/b3997ed5b013870424e84d78a561946c).
1.1.2.7.1.1. Con: Dubai is not a liberal [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Dubai) nor does it have high levels of workers' [protections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Dubai#Foreign_workers_and_labour_rights). The fact that there is an increase in working immigrants does not necessarily mean they have to be unprotected or exploited.
1.1.2.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.1.2.7.3. Con: Even illegal immigrants have children who would qualify and would dilute the available UBI resources.
1.1.2.7.3.1. Con: Non-citizen children would not qualify.
1.1.2.7.4. Con: Even if a UBI is only available to citizens, potential immigrants might have family members who are citizens and who could use their UBI payments to support them.
1.1.2.7.4.1. Con: Given most illegal immigration is from poorer to richer countries, it usually makes more sense for relatives to instead support their family by way of remittances to a poor country where their money has much higher purchasing power.
1.1.2.7.4.2. Con: Since a UBI would only be sufficient to meet basic needs, it is unlikely to be able to support additional people.
1.1.2.7.4.3. Con: It is unclear why anyone would view this as any different from other discretionary spending that people may put their UBI payments towards. These family members would be collecting no more UBI payments than anyone else.
1.1.3. Pro: For the years of [2008-2012](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5137) the US Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that persons in poor households at or below the Federal Poverty Level had more than double the rate of violent victimization as persons in high-income households.
1.1.3.1. Con: This shows a correlation, but not necessarily a causative link. It is also possible that more violent people are less likely to succeed in a civilized society, or potentially that less educated people – who would as such be less successful as well – might be more violent.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Stress makes it harder for one to control their emotions, and one more liable to feel desperate and lash out. It seems likely that this is causatively related to violence, and that reducing stress via providing a UBI to fund basic necessities would thus reduce violence.
1.1.4. Con: This is not always the case. [Crime exists at all strata of income.](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/pyschology-white-collar-criminal/503408/)
1.1.4.1. Con: Yet this does not deny that a UBI would reduce the total rate of crimes.
1.1.5. Pro: Crime stems from a lack of economic opportunities. A UBI provides a means to ameliorate this by enabling people to pursue an education or start a business; or at least live on a stable income.
1.1.5.1. Pro: With their basic needs covered by a UBI, many people are able to afford to continue with their higher education.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: When citizens can better afford to spend time studying, [overall levels of education grow](http://pas.sagepub.com/content/32/1/7.short) and the workforce becomes more skilled. This would increase the quality and pay of jobs in general.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: A UBI could also lead to decreasing levels of education, as universal financial security would lessen incentives for citizens to pursue higher education.
1.1.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The prospect of securing a higher-paying job \(an incentive undermined by a UBI\) is an important factor for many people when considering [higher education](http://study.com/articles/Why_Should_I_Seek_a_Higher_Education.html).
1.1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Many people study motivated by higher ideals or out of curiosity.
1.1.5.1.1.1.3. Con: A UBI only covers basic needs. If an individual wants to achieve a high-paying job, higher education is normally required.
1.1.5.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Even if people merely end up changing jobs, that requires a degree of flexibility, a higher education and continuous training. A guaranteed income makes people more confident embracing these changes in the job market.
1.1.5.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: People aren't able to magically change their skill set overnight, even if one job was made available before the old job was gone, that's useless to someone who can't yet fill the new role.
1.1.5.1.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Companies are less likely to offer re-training programs when they think that workers can subsist on the UBI. Workers would have to actively seek re-training, which is a significantly higher barrier to entry to maintain a position in the workforce. In this sense, people would be more likely to exit the job force, resulting in decreased innovation as a society.
1.1.5.1.1.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Workers should actively be putting in effort anyway, both to improve their current standing within their jobs and to keep whatever industry they're in moving forward.
1.1.5.1.1.1.3.1.2.2. Con: In the status quo, without a UBI, employers don't offer re-training to employees out of a sense of charity; they do so because it allows them to continue to retain a valued asset. The introduction of a UBI doesn't change this calculus, it only makes the worker better of when this training isn't on offer.
1.1.5.1.1.1.3.1.3. Con: Even if retraining were desirable, a direct solution to this problem would be to introduce a welfare benefit tied conditionally to taking up skills retraining courses. This would avoid the possibility of workers leaving the workforce altogether because welfare looks too comfortably attractive.
1.1.5.1.1.1.3.1.3.1. Con: Introducing such conditions would only force people to register for training that they had no interest in. There are already many such programs that tie in conditions to receiving welfare, and all they do is create an incredibly burdensome bureaucracy.
1.1.5.1.1.1.4. Pro: A UBI would disqualify most people from Student Aid Finance, Grants, and scholarships presently based on low income level. Many would no longer feel obliged to educate themselves minimally to qualify for jobs that they don't want to do anyway and those desiring higher education would no longer qualify for government aid to do so. Feed a nominal UBI amount into your FAFSA and watch the bottom line Expected Family Contribution figure go up!
1.1.5.1.1.2. Con: If an entire population is highly educated then it is no longer a defining feature for any individual worker. As a result it would only increase the baseline level of skills required for all jobs; leading to people doing the same work for the same money regardless of the fact that they have pursued higher education.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: Even if everybody has access to higher education, different capabilities and interests will still result in workers with different skills.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: In Scotland, where higher education is entirely [subsidised](https://beta.gov.scot/news/higher-education-student-support-for-scotland-2015-16/) by the government, and therefore everybody has access to it, not all [students](http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2003/03/16786/20354) decide to pursue a university degree.
1.1.5.1.1.2.2. Pro: [Credentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credentialism_and_educational_inflation) and degree creep have been identified as problems in a number of professions.
1.1.5.1.1.2.3. Con: Degree creep is already caused by requirements and [regulations](http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2011/11/stop-degree-creep-health-care.html) \(e.g. asking nurses or other health professionals to have extra degrees to exercise their professions\). The additional capacity to access education would not increase degree creep significantly.
1.1.5.1.1.2.4. Con: If a population in general has a higher level of education, there is greater opportunity for the diversification of interests alongside intellectual exchanges between citizens. This encourages  theoretical advancements and the creation of new jobs at levels of experience not yet achieved.
1.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: Increased levels of education are good for the economy, as educated workers are more likely to innovate.
1.1.5.1.1.3.1. Con: A UBI would take away the drive to innovate.
1.1.5.1.1.3.1.1. Con: A UBI would provide the freedom to innovate for those who already have the drive to do so.
1.1.5.1.1.3.1.2. Con: Some people have a genuine drive to improve things for society/other people/other forms of life, which provides a drive to innovate irrespective of financial incentives.
1.1.5.1.1.4. Pro: A UBI garanteed to any citizen of a said country would allow students to focus way more on their studies than on the need of earning money, thus allowing them to optimize the intellectual benefit of their learning years, to become more educated individuals, and also more capable and productive workers once they are done with their studies, increasing in return their chance to contribute to a higher production of wealth which would ultimately benefit the public finances of the said country.
1.1.5.1.1.4.1. Pro: Studying and working at the same time requires a student to split their energy, effort, time, and headspace between their study and their work, likely making them less effective at both. Exhaustion and limited personal time from the combination also creates stress and makes studies less effective by increasing the difficulty of absorbing information.
1.1.5.1.1.5. Pro: An UBI offers an individual the possibility to improve their education extensively throughout their lives which is very hard at the moment when everyone needs to work all the time for basic needs. A society with more well educated people is a much more succesfull one.
1.1.5.1.1.6. Con: Growing education levels do not necessarily increase social mobility, especially for people belonging to traditionally [oppressed](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/free-university-tuition-in-scotland-has-not-benefited-the-poor-say-academics-a6757546.html) groups. For example, many university graduates with bachelor degrees are unable to find work in their field, and [end up stuck in minimum-wage or part time jobs](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-06/college-grads-taking-low-wage-jobs-displace-less-educated).
1.1.5.1.1.6.1. Con: This is more of a problem with the economy as a whole. It is still definitely [true](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2017/01/23/dispelling-the-myth-of-underemployed-college-graduates/#43527cfb502c) that people with college degrees have an easier time finding high-paying jobs than those without.
1.1.5.1.1.6.2. Pro: This is especially pernicious given the amount of debt many students accumulate when undertaking higher education.
1.1.5.1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Sixty-eight percent of graduates from public and nonprofit colleges in the United States had an average student loan debt of [$30,100](http://ticas.org/posd/map-state-data) per borrower. This is difficult to pay back on a [minimum-wage](http://www.epi.org/publication/minimum-wage-workers-poverty-anymore-raising/) salary.
1.1.5.1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: [College graduates' average income](http://time.com/money/collection-post/3829776/heres-what-the-average-grad-makes-right-out-of-college/) is higher than the minimum-wage salary.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: After the [Iranian government introduced an UBI](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income), identified that the lessened working hours of young adults in the program would likely lead them to enroll at schools and universities to focus on their education.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: [The study](http://erf.org.eg/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1090.pdf) does not appear to conclude that the UBI increased education rates; at best, it speculates \(which anyone can do, including outside of a study\). In fact, in the conclusion, the authors write that "youth... can stay in school longer, or enjoy more leisure, though we do know which of these options they choose." \(p. 13\). Thus, we cannot use the study to conclude that the UBI improved educational enrollment, let alone by a significant amount.
1.1.5.1.2.2. Con: Even if this were an accurate characterization of the study, this may not be unique to a UBI; it is wholly plausible that if Iran was already under-providing welfare, introducing a targeted/conditional welfare program would have been more effective at increasing enrollment rates. In other words, the benefits may not have been unique to a UBI program specifically; traditional welfare might have been better for the situation.
1.1.5.1.3. Con: If higher education provides value to society, there are ample market incentives to furthering education. If, however, if this higher education is simply the self-indulgent study of topics without value to society, then it is not the role of the state to subsidize such unproductive activities.
1.1.5.1.3.1. Con: Education is nearly always of indirect if not direct benefit, as more knowledgeable people can provide or apply their knowledge in any situation where it becomes relevant \(consider someone with medical training acting as a first responder in a medical crisis despite not currently being "on-duty", or someone with specialist training pointing out a hazard which is not immediately apparent\).
1.1.5.1.3.2. Con: Education provides self-improvement and personal growth benefits from the outlay of effort and self-discipline and dedication, as well as the new information acquired allowing people to change or add to their worldview.
1.1.5.1.4. Con: But, with a UBI, there are fewer incentives to get a higher education because you'll make money no matter what.
1.1.5.1.4.1. Con: Incentives don't disappear because you have the money necessary to take care of your basic needs.
1.1.5.1.4.2. Con: Human beings are naturally curious; that is what led us to the point we are now. Having basics needs met won't change that — it is more like the opposite we will have more time to make questions.
1.1.5.1.5. Pro: People will be able to do longer studies, or retake studies at some point in their life, knowing they will have the resources to live during that time. The possibility of taking studies anytime can encourage some to acquire skills in fields with huge demand.
1.1.5.1.6. Pro: Early [YC UBI study participants](https://www.thebillfold.com/2017/09/y-combinator-is-expanding-its-basic-income-project/) are pursuing innovative projects, enrolling in career expanding education and proving the concept can work for a wider audience.
1.1.5.1.7. Con: If this is truly valuable and would be supported by a UBI, then targeted welfare could likely do this nearly as well if not better. Targeted welfare is, by design, targeted towards specific programs; UBIs may ultimately end up being used for other, less-valuable purposes.
1.1.5.1.7.1. Con: The Universal scope of a UBI allows it to support a greater range of endeavours without causing social backlash - it is the targeted nature of welfare that is precisely what prevents it from rewarding 'extraneous' activities such as education or art. When only the lower classes receive a benefit then it is framed as a handout and only designed to tide people over while they go back to traditional employment.
1.1.5.1.8. Pro: A UBI frees individuals to train and learn at any time in their life without fear of not being able to sustain themselves. People will no longer be locked into careers they found out too late that they do not like due to the inability to attain the high level of learning required to do something else
1.1.5.1.9. Pro: At the lowest end of the job market, workers often have to put in so many hours that they have little time for anything else, especially self improvement. Self improvement can only come from being able to study and or experience a greater variety of things which means either increased free time or jobs that are particularly well rounded.
1.1.5.2. Pro: A UBI makes it more likely that people will attempt to start their own companies, or become self-employed.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: [Sixty-one percent](http://www.gallup.com/poll/15832/majority-americans-want-start-own-business.aspx) of employed Americans want to start their own business, preferring to work for themselves than for someone else. This becomes possible with a UBI.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Con: Start-up failure rate in the US after 4 years is between 42% and 63%. This shows that this is not a long-term sustainable pathway for most people. \([StatisticBrain](http://www.statisticbrain.com/startup-failure-by-industry/)\)
1.1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: [Twenty-nine percent](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-reports/The-20-Reasons-Startups-Fail.pdf) of start-ups fail because they run out of funding. A UBI can offer additional capital to help businesses succeed.
1.1.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Start-ups that fail for lack of funding usually need more than the small influx of cash that one individual's UBI payment would generate.
1.1.5.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If a UBI can provide all citizens with a trickle of disposable income then it provides an environment that is suitable for crowdfunding like Kickstarter or micropayment subscription services.
1.1.5.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: If we focus on sustainability instead of profitability, then the UBI could itself start and sustain a small business.
1.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: We can help more people with a profitable and growing business than with a tax that has to pass through a bureaucracy to get to the people who need it.
1.1.5.2.1.3. Con: UBI is designed for welfare, not venture funding. Those who start a business are involved in serving the public which is a large responsibility. Those that businesses that do not serve the public must be allowed to fail quickly.
1.1.5.2.1.3.1. Con: Businesses that do not serve the public effectively will still fail or perform poorly in the presence of a UBI, as their more effective competitors will outperform them and substandard products and services will be recognized and rejected by consumers.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: Any UBI is likely barely more than poverty line; as such it is barely enough to live on let alone provide resources enough to start a business with.
1.1.5.2.2.1. Con: Removing the risk of abject poverty as a result of failure could very well be a motivating factor for quite a few lower-income people deciding whether or not to risk entrepreneurship.
1.1.5.2.2.2. Con: The largest barrier to starting a business is time. Most people cannot quit their job for long enough to get a business up and running, or the consequence of failure is to lose everything. You still require food, housing and transportation while starting a business. A UBI would allow most people to survive while also focusing on starting a business.
1.1.5.2.2.3. Con: Traditional welfare specifically prohibits doing productive work while receiving money. So while you have money to survive, you will lose it if you attempt to start a business. If you have enough to live on while staying at home surfing the internet, you could start almost any internet business for example.
1.1.5.2.2.4. Con: Some potential entrepreneurs cannot afford to leave their current employment to work on projects they hope will pan out to successful businesses.  A UBI would allow such entrepreneurs to take extended time off of paid to work to invest in their startup.
1.1.5.2.3. Pro: A UBI would enhance entrepreneurship, sustaining people while they develop projects that may take time to generate profits.
1.1.5.2.3.1. Pro: UBI pilot studies in Zambia and Mexico showed increased entrepreneurial activity. [oecd.org](http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=DCD/DAC/POVNET\(2008\)8&docLanguage=En) \(pg. 10 of the attached policy guidance note\).
1.1.5.2.3.2. Pro: Entrepreneurship and invention are in short supply in the population because there are opportunity costs associated with working a job. Jobs come with significantly more income and health and other benefits that most people can't forego. While one can create in their off-time, most people don't because the cultural norm is to focus on the paid job. The numbers of innovators would increase if the requirement to have a job in order to live were eliminated.
1.1.5.2.3.3. Pro: A UBI increases entrepreneurialism, new business ventures are more likely to be undertaken when there is some income security.
1.1.5.2.3.3.1. Pro: A UBI could free people up to create independent locally owned businesses, the real job creators in our economy. There's a solid conservative argument for this policy if they truly believe in entrepreneurship. \(I got this published in a letter to the New York Post, no less\)
1.1.5.2.3.4. Pro: Assured income to maintain a basic livelihood is the basis for most people to undertake their own enterprises. Thus it could \(and it would\) combat unemployment directly since there would be a big growth of small businesses. These businesses provide additional employment and income for people. Concerns about people not wanting to work are ungrounded, since people favor work over a life without meaning.[jamanetwork.com](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1105077,), [academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/epirev/article/30/1/118/622529/The-Relation-between-Work-related-Psychosocial), [news.gallup.com](http://news.gallup.com/poll/171044/depression-rates-higher-among-long-term-unemployed.aspx), [hemelraadenkeijzer.nl](http://www.hemelraadenkeijzer.nl/opinie/zakelijk/ondernemer/risicos-in-kaart-bij-start-eigen-bedrijf), [theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/09/sweden-startups/541413/)
1.1.5.2.3.5. Pro: UBI means that those looking to start new businesses or become self-employed can do so without the risk of losing the ability to pay for living costs. New business owners need not fear that if their business or project fails that they will be left without money to pay for rent or food, they will be protected with a UBI. This allows for trial and error with relative safety for budding entrepreneurs.
1.1.5.2.3.5.1. Pro: This allows business owners to bolster their profitability by not drawing a wage for themselves during the initial set up years when capital expenditure is high.
1.1.5.2.3.5.2. Pro: UBI would encourage more entrepreneurial activity in non-welfare states since you won't lose your healthcare if you quit your job \(you can pay for insurance with your UBI\).
1.1.5.2.4. Con: A UBI greatly increases the chances of societal [financial ruin](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/70-million-americans-teetering-on-edge-of-financial-ruin-2015-06-23) because the vast majority of people are financially irresponsible.
1.1.5.2.4.1. Pro: College students are one of many groups becoming [less responsible](https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/04/02/college-students-becoming-less-financially-responsible-study-says) with their money.
1.1.5.2.4.1.1. Con: UBI is proposed for all citizens. College students, if they are becoming less responsible, require better education and less reliance on unaffordable credit; a problem UBI might help to solve.
1.1.5.2.4.2. Con: Financial irresponsibility may lead to financial ruin, but UBI does not lead to greater financial irresponsibility.
1.1.5.2.4.3. Con: The ability to manage finances is not dependant on receiving, or not receiving, UBI.
1.1.5.2.4.4. Con: Poverty itself is one of the greatest risks for financial irresponsibility. Not having enough money to make a balanced responsible budget, only leaves the option of an irresponsible budget. Thus a UBI might lead to more financial responsibility and less financial ruin.
1.1.5.2.4.5. Pro: There may be other studies but one example is lottery winners. [Lottery winners penniless](https://www.businessinsider.com/lottery-winners-lost-everything-2017-8#lara-and-roger-griffiths-bought-their-dream-home-and-then-life-fell-apart-1)
1.1.5.2.4.5.1. Con: A UBI is distinct from lottery winnings as it is paid in regular instalments.
1.1.5.2.4.5.1.1. Pro: The single, large sum paid out by a lottery \(and the improbability of the victory\) produces excitement and the perception of sudden wealth, which makes frivolous spending more likely.
1.1.5.2.4.5.1.2. Pro: If earlier instalments of a UBI are misspent and wasted, especially if severe consequences are the result, the individual will both be incentivized and have opportunity to learn better financial management skills to use later instalments.
1.1.5.2.4.6. Con: A UBI may help to teach and encourage greater financial responsibility and more sensible spending.
1.1.5.2.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.4.5.1.2.
1.1.5.2.4.6.2. Pro: People who, due to receiving a UBI, feel stable and secure in their financial future may be more inclined to invest their money.
1.1.5.2.5. Pro: A UBI would enable a lot of people to do what they really like, instead of what they currently do for a stable income. Doing what you really like for a few years helps you master some skills which, together with great quality coming from your enthusiasm around that "hobby", might result in an increase of small businesses.
1.1.5.2.5.1. Pro: Enjoying or finding passion in one's work increases motivation and hence, willingness to put time and effort in and effectiveness.
1.1.5.2.5.2. Pro: Given time away from mundane work, a person may have more time to invest in creative hobbies which in turn can be profitable such as sculpting or carpentry, for example.
1.1.5.2.5.3. Pro: There is also no guarantee that "what one really likes" is unproductive, and indeed it is hard to find jobs \(or other activities!\) which are completely unproductive.
1.1.5.2.5.3.1. Pro: Even someone who does not produce goods which are directly valued in monetary terms or \(deliberately\) participate in intellectual or artistic endeavours still contributes to society if they interact with other people - they can provide knowledge and information, opinions and perspectives, friendship, listening and support, participation in shared/group activities \(which tend to improve with more participants and/or require a minimum/specific number of participants in most cases\)...
1.1.5.2.5.4. Con: If UBI is used for people to follow their passions, then we won't have people who will process the banalities of life. Not enough people dream of becoming a garbage collector.
1.1.5.2.5.4.1. Con: If this is true wages for banal occupations will need to rise or conditions for the workers will need to improve.  This may mean an increase in the costs of goods and services, but it will mean a decrease in people spending time in unpleasant jobs.
1.1.5.2.5.4.2. Con: Perhaps the creative energy of people freed from wage labor will be able to address some of the concerns caused by a lack of wage labor.
1.1.5.2.5.4.3. Con: UBI is intended to be sufficient to live on but not provide a luxurious life. There are likely to still be people willing to perform banal tasks in exchange for affording luxuries like international holidays.
1.1.5.2.5.4.4. Con: A pickier, reduced force will provide incentive for automation within these areas. Driverless garbage trucks for example.
1.1.5.2.5.4.5. Pro: When Spain stole Mexico’s gold [everyone there became so rich that no one would do any work](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2d2z3e/how_did_the_gold_and_silver_spain_brought_from/). If the garbage collector has thousands of dollars in his pocket, why work? If they do not work, the garbage does not go away and life really sucks.
1.1.5.2.5.4.5.1. Pro: From the link: "essentially, Spaniards began to buy goods with this imported treasure instead of making goods themselves. As others have pointed out, this led to a fairly predictable result: prices rose \(inflation\), and Spain began to import far more than it exported." Thus it was having fewer workers, and more importing of goods that ultimately caused economic failure.
1.1.5.2.5.4.5.2. Con: UBI does not necessarily mean an increase of actual money, it's more like a re-distrubution of existing wealth. Also there is no evidence that UBI would greatly reduce the workforce. Therefore it is a false equivalence to compare UBI to the influx of new gold in medieval Spain.
1.1.5.2.5.4.6. Con: If immigration policy allows it, cheaper foreign labour would fill the low-skilled job gaps, leaving native workers to progress to higher skilled jobs.
1.1.5.2.5.4.6.1. Con: Universal Basic Income [creates fiscal incentives for a country to reduce immigration](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/how-a-basic-income-in-the-u-s-could-increase-global-poverty).
1.1.5.2.5.4.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.5.2.5.4.6.1.2. Pro: A UBI requires wealthy nations to maintain strict immigration policies to restrict access to citizenship from people from less wealthy nations. It would continue to incentivize the upward distribution of wealth \(specifically resources that provide wealth\) from poor nations to wealthy nations.
1.1.5.2.5.4.6.1.3. Pro: If every citizen is entitled to a UBI, that creates political incentives to discourage immigration. The biggest economic inequalities [are been rich and poor countries](http://timharford.com/2014/11/a-passport-to-privilege/), not within rich countries, and anything that could create big barriers to migration from poor to rich countries is counterproductive to global economic justice.
1.1.5.2.5.4.6.1.4. Pro: UBI increases the difference in standard of living between countries, thus creating unsustainable migration pressure \(that may lead to overpopulation or very strict border control\).
1.1.5.2.5.5. Pro: It would allow people to do their hobbies and travel, discover the world and not do undesired job just to make for living. And if a person would like to get more money, they can find work they like.
1.1.5.2.5.6. Pro: People would be able to be in a more expansive way of living, and to manage all the things that no one dreamt of doing: We could use a schedule of volunteering where we would help each other and the community we live in to keep going. As people would be more happier with their lives, it would be easier to manage the things that by now we average see as "problems that aren't ours" as managing garbage and keeping the city clean etc. We would be aware of our compromises with our community.
1.1.5.2.6. Pro: A UBI provides an instant safety net and thus reduces the need for overly-expensive, or exploitative credit.
1.1.5.2.6.1. Pro: Banks are more likely to grant lines of credit, as applicants have a UBI to fall back on as loan security.
1.1.5.2.6.1.1. Con: Banks want a good asset-to-debt ratio when assessing loans, and will likely calculate UBI payments as a negative factor in the same way they already count Social Security Income \(in the US\) as a negative.
1.1.5.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.1.
1.1.5.2.6.3. Con: If the UBI is utilized to generate a line of credit then it is not being used to cover essentials such as food, clothing, and shelter.
1.1.5.2.7. Pro: A UBI allows people to imagine and research innovative technology and to start businesses - the engines of economic growth.
1.1.5.2.7.1. Con: UBI does not hold people accountable for misguided, delusional, or lazy attempts at innovation and research.
1.1.5.2.7.1.1. Con: Failure is an important part of innovation.  You rule out what doesn't work and are left with what does.  Permitting more people to fail at different pursuits will be a boon to innovation.
1.1.5.2.7.1.2. Con: It is not within the scope of a UBI to hold people accountable for innovation and research. This is the responsibility of other legislation.
1.1.5.2.7.1.3. Con: The lack of UBI does not actively discourage misguided, delusional or lazy attempts at innovation and research.
1.1.5.2.8. Con: Starting business is itself a risky financial proposition; something that a UBI shouldn't be encouraging for people who are on low incomes.
1.1.5.2.8.1. Con: UBI does not encourage low income individuals to start businesses directly. It simply provides more start-up capital to those who may already want to but do not have enough funds.
1.1.5.2.8.1.1. Con: A UBI might have laws that prevent it from being able used as such, thus it might not provide any start-up capital at all.
1.1.5.2.8.1.1.1. Con: A UBI is specifically designed \(and named\) to be an income that is both universal and unconditional. Any conditions on how it's spent would make it conditional, and thus also not a normal income either.
1.1.5.2.8.2. Con: A universal basic income is given to everyone, across the spectrum of earned income. Therefore, middle class people can also use their UBI to start a business.
1.1.5.2.8.3. Pro: More capital means more \(and greater\) acceptable risks can be taken by a new business owner. More risks being taken will eventually lead to more businesses entering the marketplace. This might not be a net benefit for UBI pensioners, but for the marketplace it absolutely would be.
1.1.5.2.8.4. Con: UBI provides a safety net, allowing people to try something without the fear of failure - encouraging innovation and amazing things.
1.1.5.2.8.5. Con: There is many low risk, low capital business options that can raise someone out of poverty that could be explored with a UBI in place. For example, if someone wants to become a gardener, cleaner, software developer, translator. There is a development period where the small business is only looking for customers but has no money in place. UBI would bridge that gap where as many now don't earn enough to save enough or borrow enough to bridge the 6 to 12 months to build a client list and earn more
1.1.5.2.9. Con: A UBI would also likely lead to increase income or business taxes that make it harder to start businesses or maintain employees.
1.1.5.2.9.1. Con: A UBI is agnostic to how it is funded. Increasing taxes on businesses is a choice separate from UBI.
1.1.5.2.9.2. Con: Does increasing income taxes really affect employment?
1.1.5.2.9.3. Con: With a UBI in play, businesses which provide a humanistic service would be able to claim charity exemptions \(and/or obtain volunteer work\), while businesses which do not would have to adapt to the market.
1.1.5.2.10. Con: A UBI would mean people are less likely to pursue profitable business ventures in favor of business ventures that they personally enjoy, which leads to less of society's needs \(e.g. plumbing, massage therapy, elderly care\) being met in favour of more people pursuing unsustainable businesses like party planning, book writing, etc.
1.1.5.2.10.1. Con: But if the number of people pursuing business ventures goes up and the profitable ventures are still available, there will be more people motivated to start a business who also personally enjoy making money. Supply and demand will also only make these ventures more profitable if their demand is left unmet over time.
1.1.5.2.10.2. Con: The fact that people are not forced to do unwelcome and poorly-paid jobs in order to survive does not mean that people will not do those jobs if there is a comensurate reward. If society has need of goods or services that are underprovided those goods or services would become more valuable and so able to demand a greater reward, providing a greater incentive for people to provide them. Inequality is driven by people being forced to accept unfair deals rather than be destitute in a buyers market.
1.1.5.2.10.2.1. Con: Although higher wages would still be incentive, people would still have the ability to fall back on the UBI if they run into financial trouble, which would decentives people from choosing safe jobs. This could lead to both a lot of high risk reward jobs such as philanthropy and low paying but entertaining jobs such as in the art field.
1.1.5.2.11. Con: A UBI does not provide the motivation to start businesses. It will be redirected to ease a person's suffering which are usually small vices like tobacco, alcohol, entertainment, food, etc. Starting a business or self employment requires hard work which requires motivation by a goal and paradoxically, less available money in the hopes that there will be even greater rewards in venture
1.1.5.2.11.1. Pro: A UBI erodes the personal and societal incentives for financial responsibility, self-improvement, and hard work.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1. Con: This claim has been [proven false by many studies.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIL_Y9g7Tg0)
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1. Con: None of these studies were carried out in Westernized countries. Cheap entertainment such as streaming services like Netflix could have a serious drain on the sort of "future-ward thinking" that is touted in this talk. Working pathetically low hours at a part-time job can pay for Netflix: what does that give society, except further enrichment of large corporations?
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.5.3.1.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1.2. Con: The work they do at that part-time job would presumably produce something, otherwise paying them would be economically wasteful and thus disadvantageous to the business which does so. Beyond that, if they can afford their entertainment, they have either contributed enough to earn it, or are living frugally in other areas - thus reducing their burden to society there.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1.3. Con: It is implausible that even with a UBI, someone could spend the majority of their time consuming. Either they would have to consume cheap/free goods and services, and/or make their consumption last - thereby not taking much from society, even if they don't give much in return either - or they would have to work for additional income in order to fund their consumption.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.5.3.1.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1.4. Con: Not everybody is interested in spending their days on idle entertainment, which would in many cases get rapidly boring, especially where more meaningful options are available.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1.5. Con: There have been UBI [pilots and studies all over the world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_pilots?wprov=sfla1).
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1.6. Con: "None of these studies were carried out in Western countries" is entirely untrue. This subject topic needs to be dramatically edited in order to be valid. Ref: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_pilots#Europe) and [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_pilots#North_America)
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.2. Pro: Human ingenuity has been existing long before financial incentives came into place.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.2.1. Con: The needs these financial incentives represent still existed, and did so long before human ingenuity came about. Human ingenuity evolved to help meet those needs: “necessity is the mother of invention” as the saying goes. Money is the grease in the wheels of economy; not the origin of it.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Healthy competition in the global market paired with intrinsic human curiosity could provide enough incentive to innovate.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.2.2. Pro: Many inventions where not made to achieve financial gain but to statisfy the exploratory spirit of mankind.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Historically, there was no time for anything but necessities. Only with the advent of civilization were resources plentiful enough to provide time for intellectual exploration. And even then, it was only a very few special people that advanced human knowledge based on their "exploratory spirit". Most of us are simply incapable of such and, of those that can, many are uninterested in devoting their lives to the task without compensation.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: "A very few special people advanced human knowledge" because of "historically" the lack of education and wealth disparity.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: If people are uninterested in devoting themselves to a task without compensation, it's because they have been growing in this state of mind.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.3. Con: The speaker states that a UBI is utopian, but that utopias do happen, pointing out the end of slavery, equality for women & men, etc. However those circumstances are not utopias - UBI is pure utopia.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.3.1. Con: UBI is not utopia; it is a realisable goal and a necessity due to technological change within society. Surely the greater good, the avoidance of mass poverty, is a goal that ought to be pursued. Mass poverty will see standards of living, and consumption drop, which will lead to weaker economies.
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.4. Pro: Brazil, which is a country that shares a lot of the cultural characteristics common to Western countries, has a program called "Bolsa Família" \(Family Allowance\), which is basically UBI but only to poor people. Although it is not exactly UBI, there were enough studies in Brazil to prove that the described social program did not make, with some exceptions, people lazy. In a lot of cases, the exact opposite was observed: people worked harder to pursue their dreams. [scielo.br](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ecos/v19n3/08.pdf)
1.1.5.2.11.1.1.4.1. Con: There are many countries which provide help to less-wealthy or unemployed people. Perhaps Brazil is not the best example to follow for Western countries: we're talking about a country whose wealth is [almost entirely being held by a fraction of the population](https://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Brazil-POVERTY-AND-WEALTH.html) and the less wealthy have to manage to make it out there. In that sense, a basic allowance does make sense for Brazil. It's not the case in European Western countries \(e.g. [France](https://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/France-POVERTY-AND-WEALTH.html)\) where this gap - although it does exist - is much smaller.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2. Pro: A UBI grows people's sense of entitlement and makes it harder for them to see the value of hard work.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.1. Pro: Research shows that people derive a great deal of happiness from work. In particular, for men, identity is embedded in work - consider names like Fisher, Farmer, Taylor, Cooper, and Smith. If a UBI scheme leads to increased unemployment, it will create an unhappy underclass of citizens with few incentives to become employable.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.1.1. Con: UBI will not be seen as an opportunity to stop working, but as an opportunity to do better work. More people will have more time and resources to complete projects they are passionate about and that are important to the communities in which they live.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.1.2. Con: Voluntary work is already a thing, and with the increased freedom of time and to purchase resources provided by a UBI, it is quite likely to increase in prevalence.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.1.3. Pro: It would create a permanent underclass of people who opt for disengagement from society for psychological or pseudo political reasons. This would be inherently divisive and lead to conflict between the underclass and everyone else.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.1.3.1. Con: People like this already exist. Giving them a basic income may give them enough comfort and reason to go out and take part rather than remain a recluse.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.2. Con: This claim and the basis for this claim are only true if a UBI policy would increase unemployment, however providing security could just as easily increase a persons drive to seek creative, innovative, and hardworking employment, because if you have economic security you will likely seek and be more willing to take economic risk, like investment, startup and employment and etc.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.3. Con: As sentient beings, it can be argued that human beings do have certain entitlements they should assert and fight for.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.4. Con: This is merely conjecture, with no evidence to support it. Until enough longitudinal studies have been conducted, you cannot assert that the UBI does anything. The recent Finnish study will end at the end of 2018.[Finnish study](http://basicincome.org/news/2017/05/finland-first-results-basic-income-pilot-not-exactly/)
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.5. Con: Not everybody considers hard work as a virtuous value, to some it is a sad necessity to be minimized.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.5.1. Pro: The puritan work ethic of modern capitalism propagates a harmful ideology that equates ones self-worth and self-actualisation through productivity and achievement.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: John Stuart Mills was an early advocate against the 'gospel of work'; that work should be considered just only if instrumental to some greater object; [not as an end unto itself.](http://abolishwork.com/2014/01/15/some-anti-work-comments-from-john-stuart-mill/)
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: If we had UBI we would be a lot more productive and creative as we would not have to worry about where our next meal was coming from nor would we be tied up in menial, soul-destroying labour simply to make others richer.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.5.1.2. Con: One's worth to society is shown through how they contribute to the society. It's not harmful, but rather fair, because the more you contribute to society, the more you get out of society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: What is here said, and what is perceived are very rarely the same thing, even if it is not the intent to communicate these harmful ideas, the harm still occurs.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.5.1.2.2. Con: There are innumerable contributions made to society that are not recognized monetarily, from raising children to the passive and understated, yet undeniable and subtly powerful information transfer in every conversation, to the increase in morale \(including workers' morale!\) provided by free entertainments and collaborative \(or competitive\) leisure activities, to free mental and physical health care provided by friends and family.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.5.1.2.2.1. Con: In a super crowded world, having children is not a valuable contribution, it just creates another person to consume our limited resources. It shouldn't be endorsed.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.5.1.2.3. Con: By that same logic we ought not care for the elderly and those unable to work, or tie down children with a social debt they have to pay off upon reaching adult hood.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.5.2. Pro: The richest value [working smarter](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/anthony-w-orlando/the-rich-arent-rich-becau_b_4791626.html), not harder. They leverage their time and skills in order to provide the highest output with less time, resulting in more time for enjoyable activities, or work if they choose.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.6. Con: The UBI may indeed grow the sense of entitlement, but this sense is not necessarily false. There are many things that certain people get for free while others have to pay for with their hard labor. The earth and its resources should in principle be shared equally between all inhabitants; our civilization is a product of generations and its fruits should not be in hands of few. This realization has nothing to do with how we approach hard work: some value progress while others do not.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.7. Pro: A UBI seems like a typical "western medicine" not focusing on the source of the problem. If we put into equation our future technological advancement and the fact that UBI might grow to a decent salary. The average Joe will not take this as a life opportunity to do something meaningful for himself and/or help his community; instead becoming even more passive and indulging in lazy behavior such as video games, porn, and fast food.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.7.1. Con: Our future technological advancement should also be considered in future opportunity, the opportunities may not be the same as they have been. So to say that the average joe will not take this as an opportunity is not a good argument since we simply can't say what people would do given the kind of freedom this would give.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.8. Pro: For some of us part of our sense of self worth depends on actually contributing something to society. We would not want to feel like another government owned drone.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.8.1. Con: This suggests nothing outside of paid labor has a positive effect on society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.8.2. Con: These are the kind of people who would benefit from a UBI. You would be able to pursue whatever meaningful work you wanted to, but also receive the UBI on top of those wages.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.8.2.1. Pro: Jobs that make one feel like they lack agency could be avoided in favour of jobs one actually wants to work when a UBI is available.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.9. Pro: People will be incentivized to not work. Why will you work 180 hours a month for $2,000 when you can get $1500 for 0 hours?
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.9.1. Con: Because with $3500 \(your salary + UBI\) you buy a lot more than only with the UBI. On the other hand, simple welfare has the problem you point: only the ones not working are eligible for help, therefore sometimes it looks more appealing to just get government aid instead of working
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.10. Pro: A UBI will cause different professions of clearly different value to suddenly have the same value. For instance, a waiter and a cook require very different skill sets and time devotion, and therefore they get paid differently. However, with a UBI, the value of that work done by the cook is thereby deemed equal in value to that of a waiter, which is not at all the case.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.10.1. Pro: A UBI will incentivize people with higher paying jobs, like that of a management job, to greatly reduce their quality of work. If a manager gets the same UBI payment as their employee, but the manager does a lot more work, the manager will not have any incentive to do a good job because, no matter what, they will always be paid the same.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.10.1.1. Con: People in higher paying positions likely won't want promotions less just because people who aren't in their positions are given enough to get by. Its not in that type of persons nature to do so, their goal is to make more.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.10.1.2. Con: Managers are motivated by a high salary, irrespective of whether they receive a UBI; compared to a manager's salary, a UBI is a very small amount.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.10.2. Con: There are different skill sets among many minimum wage jobs, also UBI doesn't effect differences in wages.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.10.3. Con: A UBI is also given to doctors and CEOs. If this effect exists it would surely raise the average apparent value of low income professions.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.10.4. Con: UBIs will not replace wages paid for work; they will be additional money paid to every citizen, on top of what they earn from their job.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.11. Con: A UBI creates a new baseline that ensures everybody has their basic needs met. Hard work, competition and ambition can still proceed from that new baseline.
1.1.5.2.11.1.2.12. Pro: In Spain, state pensioners are protesting that their pensions are too meagre and pressure the government to guarantee inflation-indexed updates, \([Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/2018/03/17/thousands-of-spanish-pensioner-s-protest-over-pensions)\) even though state pensions are among the highest in Europe, typically exceed contributions made by the pensioner while working, and crucially, demography shows that such a guarantee will be unsustainable in the long run \([El Pais](https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/01/29/inenglish/1517221833_150575.html).\) This suggests that people receiving a UBI may feel a similar sense of entitlement and disengagement from society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.3. Pro: UBI's don't address the right problem, it's not people not having enough money. The problem is deeper than that. Human beings are beasts of burden, if people aren't provided a place where they can accept social responsibility they degenerate, especially conscientious types.
1.1.5.2.11.1.3.1. Con: There is an entire [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/rutger_bregman_poverty_isn_t_a_lack_of_character_it_s_a_lack_of_cash/reading-list) and associated reading list disproving this exact claim. A lack of cash is actually specifically a cause of stress that forces poor decision making, and international studies suggest that a UBI will create a happier, more satisfied population.
1.1.5.2.11.1.3.2. Pro: The core problem is money creation, and the fact that each is not enfranchised in the process. Money is loaned into existence, and interest paid to maintain the value. That interest is not directly distributed to each, even though each is compelled to accept the money in trade for goods and services. This largest stream of money, the interest paid on global sovereign debt, represents the financial security provided by states, and should be equally shared with each
1.1.5.2.11.1.3.3. Pro: A UBI would hurt those individuals who are suffering from depression and mental illness by giving them the easy out to leave the workforce which is usually a help to their coping skills, self esteem and social well being.
1.1.5.2.11.1.3.3.1. Con: Mental illness would be greatly helped by a UBI, allowing an unwell individual to focus on self-improvement instead of trying to just maintain survival.
1.1.5.2.11.1.3.3.2. Con: Depression and mental illness can be caused by seemingly \(or actually\) hopeless situations - or situations where every outcome is a poor or undesirable one. Such situations would be made less likely by a UBI, as the money could always be used to ensure one's survival and a certain level of quality of life, or avoid/rectify specific issues or situations.
1.1.5.2.11.1.3.4. Pro: Work is one of the most normal ways for a human to find meaning. With working being the cause for the consequence that is feeding your family/providing and education and shelter, there is a deep sense of meaning and responsibility in doing so. Once taken away, a void of meaninglessness is created, and we don't know how to fill it.
1.1.5.2.11.1.3.4.1. Con: A UBI would allow people to work towards additional purchases or benefits for their family \(e.g. working a paid job to provide luxuries for their family\), directly work towards things of value for their family \(e.g. hand-crafting stuff for them or doing domestic labour\), or contribute to the broader community rather than being "trapped" thinking at the "local" level of maintaining their own family.
1.1.5.2.11.1.3.5. Con: The parts of western society that have a growing amount of austerity and lack of income are the exact people that degenerate for an inability to provide social responsibilities and connect with local communities. Money for the average jo is limiting not just on an economic level, but proven to be a burden on a psychological level too; the UBI devalues that money in order to help the individual move past it and contribute something more than just consumption.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4. Pro: A taxpayer-funded UBI acts as a state-sponsored "Robin Hood" system, without actually motivating people to be productive in order to provide their own incomes.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1. Pro: Money is worth a certain amount due to the amount of effort required to make it; it is a measure of the worth of a person's time, resources, and effort toward making something of value to others. To take this money from a person and give it to someone who hasn't taken the time or effort to earn it disincentivizes productive work.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1. Con: This argument can be equally applied to all forms of taxes. Yet taxes exist in nearly every society because their collective value overrides the individual harms.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The question is, however, whether the problem lies in the argument, or in the assumptions made on the necessity of those taxes.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Few people would argue for the removal of the military, the police, public road, or the sewer, and most of those that act upon this belief quickly die as a result of their lack of these facilities. Maintaining those takes money, and that money has to come from somewhere.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Many services have historically been provided through collective action. These kind of systems could return or be rejuvenated.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There have been historical cases of polycentric legal systems, where even the writing and administering of law was in essence [privatized](http://www.tomwbell.com/writings/JurisPoly.html).
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: These laws always existed in addition to, not instead of, actual law.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Commercial examples are effectively contracts, and as such require consideration not only for a person to be entered into the contract, but for the existing members of the contract to grant outsiders the protections of this contract, if these are not granted, abuse will happen.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Mutual respect doesn't keep criminals from robbing one's house, murdering you, or just about anything else, it has no enforcement mechanism for failure cases, and relying solely on it would be a disaster.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: There are many thieves, but few murderers. Clearly there is at least some aspect of mutual respect common to humanity that means we rarely cause each other grievous harm.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The warlords of Japan and Europe might have repelled foreign invaders, but they definitely killed, and took advantage of those they 'protected'.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If warlords did not draw some profit from those they protect, they could not afford to offer that protection.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: There has also been someone that [tried to privitize public parking](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=412240643). Just because a thing can be privatized does not at all mean it is best for the public.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Roads have often been built or maintained by collective action, often in the form of toll roads.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Toll roads are often disliked by the public.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Observation shows that putting a toll on a road reduces usage. See, for example: [Lindsey R. "Congestion Relief: Assessing the Case for Road Tolls in Canada." C.D. Howe Institute](https://cdhowe.org/sites/default/files/attachments/research_papers/mixed//commentary_248.pdf)
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Protests against tolls are not uncommon. For example, in the first month of 2018, the following protests were reported: [Lekki Toll Hike Area Boys smash phones and cameras as Lagosians protest new fares](http://www.pulse.ng/news/local/area-boys-disrupt-lekki-toll-protests-in-lagos-id7959535.html), [Gurugram residents take to streets to protest against toll plaza](http://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/civic-issues/article/gurugram-residents-take-to-streets-to-protest-against-toll-plaza/190828), and[Bayside Group To Protest Gov. Cuomo's Congestion Pricing Plan](https://patch.com/new-york/bayside/bayside-group-protest-gov-cuomos-congestion-pricing-plan).
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.3. Pro: Political parties often try to win votes by promising to reduce \(or subsidise\) tolls. For example, in order to win support in Western Sydney seats, the NSW Labor Party, in Australia, committed the State to providing a cashback on tolls that has, so far, cost over $1.5 billion AUD.[Taxpayer bill for cashback scheme on Sydney toll roads hits $1.5 billion - and climbing](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/taxpayer-bill-for-cashback-scheme-on-sydney-toll-roads-hits-15-billion--and-climbing-20161207-gt6hiq.html)
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.4.1.4. Con: When costs are concentrated and benefits are spread thin and wide, those carrying the cost are usually louder than those who enjoy the benefit, which distorts perceptions.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: Power companies - like Edison's electricity company - have often been private, even when building substantial public infrastructure.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Power companies such as Edison were dangerous monopolies that ignored public safety to the point of giving [the Dodgers their name](https://gizmodo.com/the-la-dodgers-got-their-name-from-brooklyns-deadly-str-1687077696), and [suffocating innovation](http://jawadonweb.com/?page_id=900), all while using public resources.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.5.2. Con: The claim that "power companies have often been private" \(true though it is\) does not support its parent claim \("many service has been provided through collective action"\)
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Yes but your con is being applied to the argument that taxes are unjust in a general sense, and does not take into account the context of the tax \(e.g., to pay for UBI\). Your claim is infact a pro to the above claim, not a con.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: It could be equally claimed to be illegitimate to take income from A to help pay for B's security; for the courts used to enforce their rights; or for the use of other public goods that are available to all but are used disproportionately by some.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.2. Con: However, the amount of actual work that is required to make money actually reduces in proportion to the amount of money you already have, as you have a greater ability to loan, invest, and take financial risks.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: You can make money without working by loaning out existing money. Active investment does take effort, but even that effort can be bought for others for less than the proceeds from investing the capital.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.3. Con: This argument assumes that 100% of the production comes from human activities. This has already changed with massive automation and will change further with more and more AIs in charge of production. In that case, the "net payers" would not be humans, but automated systems and therefore there would be no loss of freedom for human actors.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.4. Con: What capitalism rewards often has no relation to its actual value to society. CEOs are paid hundreds of times more than the average worker, but they do not provide hundreds of times the value than the average worker does.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.5. Con: What constitutes "productive work"? Not all forms of work exist in the market. For example, child rearing and other forms of domestic work performed by family members goes uncompensated, yet is vital to the function of society. The productivity of work is not dictated merely by the "free" market.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.6. Con: Money is not the only resource of value to people and society;and, whilst some value it as the only resource, some require a UBI to pursuit the creation of resources. Ideas, innovation and creation may be born of adversities, but those with nothing cannot be expected to contribute let alone create until we give them the basic means to do so.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.7. Con: A homeless individual without a roof or a bed has not the energy to work, let alone be productive, from lack of sleep; same also for those unable to afford food. Exhaustion and starvation don't just disincentivize work, they make work almost impossible to undertake. The exhausted and starving will be more productive with food in their bellies and a good nights sleep thanks to a UBI.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.8. Con: The parent claim describes the Labor Theory of Value. It holds that the value of a product corresponds to the amount of effort that went into creating it. By contrast, the Subjective Theory of Value holds that the value of a product is determined by the importance that each individual market actor places upon it and is willing to bid. Following the Labor Theory, a hole that someone has dug and filled back in 100 times would be highly productive even though it offers  no value to society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.8.1. Con: The amount of labour that goes into something is not completely irrelevant to the market value of something - whilst it is not the only factor, there can be recognition of the amount of labour that went into something, and the fact that the market has both sellers and buyers; there may, of course, be no market for something at the price that the seller wants, but equally, there may be no seller who is willling to sell at the rate that the buyer\(s\) are offering.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.2. Con: [This study of an experiment with UBI in India](http://www.developmentpathways.co.uk/resources/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Indias-Basic-Income-Experiment-PP21.pdf) points otherwise. Most critically, "production" can be measured in the short term and the long term, and the UBI moves the recipient's lens more towards the latter.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.3. Con: Contrary to the assumption of this claim, redistribution of wealth \(here phrased as "a state-sponsored 'Robin Hood' system"\) is good because it allows for a more egalitarian society, therefore [reducing numerous social problems](https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/spirit-level).
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.3.1. Con: The study used as basis doesn't address the downsides of egalitarianism such as the decrease in productivity.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.4. Con: Forcing people to work under threat of starvation, homelessness, and/or death is fundamentally barbaric.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.4.1. Pro: Once the state claims the rights over lands, water and any useful resource, and prevent people to use those to survive, the minimum that the state could do is to provide the basic needs to it's population.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.4.1.1. Con: The basic needs of people differ on an individual basis. For example some people have need for medical treatment that is not needed or deemed as a basic need by most.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: This does not mean that the state should not provide things which are basic needs for all. Specific programs can also be put into place to address specific needs.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.4.1.2. Con: The state does not claim rights over land, water or any useful resource. Individuals buy these resources and trade it among themselves, if the government truly owned these resources like they do in communist countries, than yes it would be the responsibility of the state to distribute these resources to their citizens
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: In most countries, government legislation permits and manages the claiming, purchase, and sale of such resources.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.4.2. Con: Starvation, homelessness, and death all happen in nature if one does not work towards obtaining resources for their own survival. Therefore not providing resources for free isn't barbaric.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.4.2.1. Con: Nature is barbaric - the point of a society is to do better than that.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.4.3. Con: If people do not work for the food or land they are consuming, than they are actively consuming the goods produced by someone else without compensating that person. The state is not forcing the individual to work to eat food the state creates, the state is protecting the individuals right to sell the fruit of their labor to their neighbor and receive compensation.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.4.4. Con: Forcing someone to work for food and then giving half of what they worked for to someone who does nothing is barbaric. Requiring that people function as adults and do their part to earn their own food is called participating in society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.5. Con: People are motivated to be productive by more than just money. After meeting basic needs, almost everybody seeks a sense of purpose, and of social value. Money alone is a poor way to achieve these.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.5.1. Con: There has never been a time in human history where all basic needs have been met without having additional responsibility. Purpose has always arisen out of responsibility. Even before money was invented, purpose and societal value was found in cultivation and trade.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.6. Con: Poverty is not an incentive to work and be productive, it is a barrier to it.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.7. Pro: Anti-meritocratic systems are by definition unfair. Merit has benefits and therefore should be rewarded.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.7.1. Con: Merit and wealth are two separate things. A UBI doesn't necessarily eliminate merit itself, it simply stops wealth as being the primary measure of merit. Contribution to others could just as easily be used.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.7.1.1. Con: Wealth is purported to reflect the exchange of earnings based on competency and therefore merit. The two concepts are closely associated.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.8. Con: A UBI would not necessarily have to be funded by taxes. It could be funded by a sovereign wealth fund that is sustained with the proceeds of the use \(or abuse\) of our natural resources, eg mineral leases, public land forestry, fines on polluters. This money is our birthright, literally the “commonwealth” the founders envisioned.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.9. Pro: Humans are too complex to suggest that a UBI, untethered from providing value to society, would be beneficial to all. Some would benefit and find their own way to/continue to contribute and some would quickly devolve into hedonism and/or nihilism. This will include the lazy and unmotivated and also those whose upbringing and/or culture did not instill altruism or accomplishment as important values. It will create a self-perpetuating underclass.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.10. Pro: A UBI will promote the false idea that there is such thing as a free lunch because people will constantly receive something for doing nothing. The renowned economist Milton Friedman wrote a book about how there is no such thing as a free lunch-[amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Theres-Such-Thing-Free-Lunch/dp/087548297X). A UBI appears to be ‘free’ but it will in reality be very costly, to one group or another.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.11. Pro: UBI will produce freeloaders who do nothing and contribute little to society. Without the incentive of having to making money, the freeloaders will never try to improve life for themselves or for others around them.
1.1.5.2.11.1.4.12. Pro: A UBI promotes stagnation and irresponsibility among the poor. After welfare reform in the 90's limiting who could receive welfare, and making it more of a temporary thing poverty rates and unemployment rates fell. [Poverty & Unemployment Data](https://fee.org/articles/undeniable-welfare-reform-increased-work-and-reduced-poverty/)
1.1.5.2.11.1.5. Pro: When a basic standard of living is available to all some people will not contribute to its upkeep. This selfishness creates [resentment in those who do contribute](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=QORW1i6XDKgC&pg=PA192&lpg=PA192&dq=welfare+resentment+surveys&source=bl&ots=CfzLza5DRM&sig=FgGV1gEjyqMN_IWkZonVnSGO82s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjw9ZanoefWAhWJTrwKHfwVAyoQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q&f=false); an aspect of human nature that a UBI plays out on a much larger scale than previous redistribution schemes.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.1. Con: When a person has just enough money to provide themselves shelter they will still strive for self development and contribute to society out of boredom and loneliness.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.2. Con: Some UBI plans are designed around the principle that people economize: they seek to expend the least-means for the most gains. These plans assume landlords and vendors will try to make profit, while consumers will try to spend as little as they can. Profitable prices within the buying power of a UBI capture a market otherwise inaccessible. Without this feature of human nature, such plans fail, and so it is obvious the planners understand the fundamental tendency toward self.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.3. Con: Population levels and labor force expand in abundance, and so a baseline of unemployment exists. A small percentage being simply unmotivated to contribute only shifts them out of the labor force, and the overall situation goes unchanged.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.3.1. Con: The labor force is rapidly [diminishing](https://ideas.ted.com/the-rise-of-the-useless-class/) for the foreseeable future as a result of reducing incentives for the provision of labour. Therefore a larger percentage of \(often helplessly\) unmotivated contributors will be created.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.4. Con: People who have a good life do not have as much incentive to resent others, as they have less stress and thus less reason to seek a place for blame.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.4.1. Con: Resentment, stemming from jealousy, is a common human emotion which isn't eliminated by higher socioeconomic status. Crucially, the prominence of higher opportunity at a lower rate of investment fundamentally disregards the meritocracy of the traditional 'good life', which generates an exceptionally higher incentive for jealousy.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.5. Con: A policy is not measured by what people think about those who benefit, but rather to the benefit to society. Given a UBI is an economic policy it should be measured by its economic benefit.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.5.1. Con: It is also a humanitarian and welfare policy. This makes it a moral issue in a way most economic policies are not. It is a responsible government's duty to look out for the best interests of all its populace, whether they are wealthy and economically powerful or not. A UBI could be argued to be a way of doing so.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.5.2. Con: A policy that creates widespread resentment could result in a net negative for society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.6. Con: That resentment in and of itself is incentive to work. Perception in the social order, and class struggle are also elements of human nature.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.6.1. Pro: Social pressures can be a very effective way to change behaviours.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.7. Con: Human nature is as diverse as humans are and you cannot ascribe values to such a vague and ill-defined concept.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.8. Con: Those who contribute will earn more, therefore, there will not be any resentment.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.8.1. Pro: As long as those who work are compensated fairly then they will be happy to bask in their higher place in the hierarchy. UBI does not eradicate inequality, it eradicates need-based incentives.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.8.1.1. Pro: The lack of need-based incentives enables individuals to accept only jobs that are meaningful and will be worth the time spent doing them.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.8.2. Con: Wealth disparities are not the only cause of demographic adversity.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.9. Con: Once the State claimed the right over lands and sea it prevented the people to search for alternative ways to survive. Having no State is also dangerous because then only the laws of the strongest prevail. Thus given the necessity of its existence, the State has the responsibility to provide the means for its people to survive.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.10. Pro: Everything in our world has evolved through the process of "trial by fire" or "survival of the fittest". Nowhere in nature do you see any means of "welfare". In animal groups, each animal does their part. In the plant world, they die off if conditions become too harsh. While mankind is more intelligent the principles of the earth are the same.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.10.1. Con: Selective pressures are a property of a circumstance in which there is adversity to begin with. In a developed society, with reduced adversity by increasing automation, the framework of analysis inherently pushes away from taking action against selective pressures.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.10.2. Con: "Nowhere in nature do you see any means of 'welfare'." [African Wild Dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82kQTkWnKwg&t=2s) bring back food for the old, sick, baby sitters, and pups. Not all nursing mothers stay behind, just a few stay to feed the pups.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.10.3. Con: What is natural is not necessarily good.
1.1.5.2.11.1.5.11. Con: A basic standard of living is already available to all in the form of Prison. People that contribute don't appear to be resentful of those living in Prison.
1.1.5.2.11.1.6. Con: This presupposes that those are virtues. While some consider self-improvement to be virtuous, it doesn't need to be considered as such. It's merely a tool that allows people, to improve their living conditions or accomplish a goal when needed.
1.1.5.2.11.1.6.1. Pro: A UBI instead frees people to find other ways to self-improve by removing the forced correlation between being able to eat and submitting to a job. A UBI would free people to make better contributions.
1.1.5.2.11.1.6.1.1. Con: Too many people would instead take the opportunity to explore what they consider their undiscovered artistic genius. Combining a UBI with turnkey self-publishing could create a nation full of subpar poets and writers, indistinguishable from simple layabouts.
1.1.5.2.11.1.6.1.1.1. Con: Artistic works contribute to society by allowing not only enjoyment, but new ideas to spread. The inspiration thus created could lead to many other positive results.
1.1.5.2.11.1.6.2. Pro: Different cultures have different perspectives on what is virtuous, so it is difficult to bring virtue into an objective argument.
1.1.5.2.11.1.6.3. Con: Financial responsibility is most definitely a virtue in any society. This is globally accepted by economies.
1.1.5.2.11.1.6.3.1. Con: Economies base their virtues on how much profit society can make, but humans shouldn't base their virtue on economies but rather on the happiness of living for everyone.
1.1.5.2.11.1.6.4. Pro: Hard work is not an intrinsic utilitarian or moral goal. For example, we embrace labor multiplying technologies such as tractors, dishwashing machines, laundromats, automobiles, and other tools and social systems that facilitate radical reductions in labor without a corresponding perception of moral failure or laziness.
1.1.5.2.11.1.7. Pro: UBI kills the initiative and incentives of people who are productive.
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.1. Pro: The point of a UBI is to eliminate the perverse incentive to receive welfare rather than work, but the level of taxation that it demands creates an even larger perverse incentive not to work.
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.1.1. Con: With a UBI in place, tax brackets can be adjusted up, in order to produce incentives to perform work in the lower brackets.
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.1.2. Con: With an UBI in place, taxation can be applied more heavily to activities which are no longer performed by humans due to automation and AI proliferation, creating incentives for new and innovative human activities which are virtually tax free.
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.1.3. Con: The point of a UBI is supposed to be to ensure fair and reasonable living conditions and a fair share of wealth intrinsically generated by a country, while also improving both living and working conditions.
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.1.4. Con: The point of a UBI is to help give everybody the same set of starting conditions. Then meritocracy can play out fairly.
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.1.4.1. Con: This is harmful because it fails to recognize the systemic and structural inequalities that make meritocracy an untenable concept.
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.1.4.1.1. Con: Systemic inequalities rooted in discrimination \(e.g. racism or sexism\) are difficult to tackle and thus a perfect meritocracy is indeed hard to achieve, yet that is not reason enough to reject a policy that could at least reduce some forms of inequality \(income and class\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.2. Con: If people want to— or already do — live in locations with higher standards of living they will work hard to get there. A UBI will not cover, only supplement, such high costs.
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.3. Con: Productivity is not dependent on salary and compensation. Happy, healthy people are far, far more productive than  miserable, yet well payed people.
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.4. Pro: A fundamental economic principle is to add value through work. When income is given for free without work this does not add value to the economy.
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.4.1. Con: There are no things like "fundamental economic principles", they are observations that have been valid in the past. They are traditions in the sense that they have been repeated so often people take them for laws. E.g. there could be so many opportunity costs that are avoided that the net turnover will be positive \(think of health, less pollution, etc.\)
1.1.5.2.11.1.7.5. Con: This is a generalization, many people are interested in being productive or good at something for the enjoyment of it.
1.1.5.2.11.1.8. Con: This would suggest that all forms of assistance or help that keep you from dropping into a hole are wrong and should be eliminated. Not all forms of assistance are bad, therefore UBI could be a way to provide it \(and in a proactive, before the tragedy, way\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.9. Con: By the same argument you could say that being rich removes our societal incentives for financial responsibility, self improvement and hard work. But no one would suggest that we outlaw wealth in order to incentivise society by having everyone live on the edge of poverty.
1.1.5.2.11.1.9.1. Pro: Personal responsibility and accountablity does not rely on the possibility of becoming completely poor.
1.1.5.2.11.1.9.1.1. Pro: A UBI increases the chance of a person being more motivated and productive, as less pressure can make a person more happy and willing to contribute to society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.9.1.1.1. Pro: [Financial stress](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/employees-financial-issues-affect-their-job-performance.aspx) can affect health to the point of decreasing productivity. A UBI can alleviate this stress, thus indirectly increasing productivity.
1.1.5.2.11.1.9.1.1.1.1. Pro: Increasing amounts of physical illnesses are being found to be stress-related, as stress weakens the immune system and negatively affects the physical body in other ways.
1.1.5.2.11.1.9.1.1.1.2. Pro: UBI reduces levels of stress and anxiety that result from an insecurity in wages and allows a person to build psychological resources that enhance possibility for upward mobility.
1.1.5.2.11.1.9.1.2. Con: Positions that are necessary for society to continue functioning should be remunerated adequately. Implementing UBI is a band-aid solution to a systemic problem.
1.1.5.2.11.1.9.1.2.1. Con: A UBI would not prevent remuneration for essential positions from being provided.
1.1.5.2.11.1.9.1.3. Pro: This assumes that the only reason to work hard is for financial gain. Actually there are many incentives to work hard like personal satisfaction of contributing to your community, doing something you love, creating something, being part of a team achieving something. We can find motivation to work hard for so many reasons, and if the motivation is not financial we are likely to worker harder and with more passion.
1.1.5.2.11.1.9.2. Con: Wealth is created by working hard and/or developing and investing in products and services that raise people's living standards. Outlawing wealth would remove the incentive for people to work hard and invest, eroding living standards over time.
1.1.5.2.11.1.9.3. Con: Being rich does remove societal incentives for financial responsibility for many individuals. Being poor is a great motivator for financial success.
1.1.5.2.11.1.9.4. Con: Those who are rich \(not because of their parents etc. but by work\) have very often already shown successful behavior which is aimed for. Further incentive to bring them to work does not seem necessary, contrary to the prior claim of making lower earning or non-working classes aim higher. Therefore the same argument does not apply here as the direction of impact is inverse.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10. Con: This argument can only possibly apply to a very small subset of people who are living day to day on handouts - and are one wage check away from starvation. They are certainly motivated by poverty but I would suggest that the resultant worry, desperation & anxiety would outweigh any positive effects that we would consider 'motivation'. It's like saying we shouldn't ban disease because it motivates people to get better.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.1. Pro: When weighing the consequences of poverty and homelessness against a desire to foster personal responsibility, human suffering has to take precedence.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.1.1. Pro: We may value the mindset of responsibility, but if people are needlessly suffering for what's essentially a question of ethics, there should be no question—save one's fellow man first, then begin building a sense of community and accountability. As [per Maslow](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html), the hierarchy of needs necessitates food and shelter be tackled before refining a sense of responsibility.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.1.1.1. Con: Saving your fellow man is only a worthwhile burden to carry when the man being saved is taking whatever responsibility they are able to take in their rescue. The responsibility for one's own life rests first with the individual, and with the community and government second only when full individual effort is not sufficient.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.1.1.1.1. Con: The stated conditions are often being met by the group in question.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.1.1.1.2. Con: Theoritically this is foolproof. But in practice, how do you establish when one's "effort" to save their lives is sufficient or not ? At the core of this claim, there is the idea that ensuring responsibility can be more important than saving a life. Human solidarity exists in part because personal will doesn't always suffice againts natural and societal odds. This is partly belief, but one person's will has less power than an entire  society's rules and culture.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.1.1.1.3. Con: Some people are not in a mental state to make their full effort, and this is not always correctly diagnosed. Third-party evaluators can also be incorrect about someone's capabilities, such as in the case of "invisible" disabilities, and demand unreasonable or impossible efforts. UBI allows for both of these factors.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.1.2. Con: When poverty and homelessness are the consequences of continued lack of personal responsibility, human suffering is simply a consequence of a personal decision. Thus the Universal word on UBI is the great issue here.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.1.2.1. Con: Calling poverty and homelessness consequences of a lack of personal responsibility ignores centuries of systemic oppression and presumes that people can pick themselves up by their own bootstraps. Those that have are exceptions to the rule, and should take care to avoid survivorship bias.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.1.2.1.1. Pro: Structural social and economic conditions are the main factor for poverty/wealth.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.1.2.2. Con: There are many reasons to believe most victims of poverty and homelessness are not suffering from the continued lack of personal responsibility, but rather have been forced into that situation by other factors.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.2. Pro: Some people might have disabilities which prevent them from being responsible for their financial well being and might not be picked up by current social security.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.2.1. Con: This problem is not efficiently addressed by an universal instrument such as an Universal Basic Income. UBI should be considered with the goal of serving a broader audience.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.3. Pro: This truly depends on the height of the UBI and the financial mobility of all kinds of groups within that country. If the UBI would merely ensure the affordability of only essential services & products that are considered primary life needs \(such as a house, food,medicine, et cetera\), there would be plenty people that would seek income of their own to afford pretty much everything else that one wants and needs as a citizen during their daily lives. Because of this, their incentive would not die.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.3.1. Pro: Basic Income can be incremental — the amount that defines one 'mans' basic is another's luxury.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.4. Con: It also applies to everybody who measures success in dollars - even if they don't actually care about the dollars themselves.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.5. Con: Claims have been made that UBI gives people more freedom to select jobs or to go jobless for a time rather than search desperately. To the extent those claims are true, UBI could reduce your motivation to keep a job or to work as hard as you can even when you aren't living paycheck to paycheck.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.6. Pro: Avoiding destitution is not the reason most people work and cannot be the basis for a fulfilling or productive career. Financial incentives contribute to social status, which is a reason why people strive for higher-paid work, but changing those incentives would be a benefit of UBI.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.7. Pro: A UBI only erodes incentives rooted in fear of poverty and death. These incentives are only useful in creating a desperate slave workforce, as compared to healthy incentives like actual passions or an authentic drive to contribute to society and the local community from a position of empowerment, health, security, and consent.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.7.1. Pro: This is where civic duty must be rewarded. In essence, the consumer of the provided service should be public. As such, those performing greater good should receive higher rewards. Uncertain who gets to decide what is right or wrong.
1.1.5.2.11.1.10.8. Con: Individuals who are disenfranchised are the least likely to be apathetic towards their jobs. The one saving grace from starvation \(a paycheck\) does not reduce incentive to prevent starvation \(getting a paycheck\). Poverty is not the subject of interest in the analysis of extra opportunity space \(the root argument which does or doesn't decrease productivity\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.11. Con: This depends on the amount of money offered by the UBI. If low enough, there is plenty of incentive to get "more", while still freeing people from thinking of what to eat next or where to have shelter.
1.1.5.2.11.1.11.1. Pro: The difference between a UBI and a minimum salary has to be regularized, in order to avoid mechanisms where not working is more remunerative than doing so.
1.1.5.2.11.1.11.1.1. Con: This will lead to a general decrease in job positions, as with the same money an entrepreneur will be able to hire fewer people.
1.1.5.2.11.1.11.1.2. Pro: This could force large company enterpreneurs to invest more of their capitals in working force.
1.1.5.2.11.1.11.2. Con: A too-low UBI would not be helpful. Instead of keeping it too low in comparison to the least paid job, we should increase the lowest possible pay.
1.1.5.2.11.1.11.2.1. Con: Agreed: A too-low UBI is not helpful, it should be good enough for making a living. The attack goes to "we should imcrease the lowest possible pay". With a high-enough UBI, there is no need for a lowest possible pay: people would be happy doing a work they love almost for free, if they have a living and a meaning in life.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12. Con: Existing welfare schemes also erode personal responsibility and accountability; often to a much higher degree because of the high effective marginal tax rates. A UBI would actually reduce this effect relative to the status quo.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1. Pro: Existing welfare schemes reduce people's incentive to work because earning more money reduces the number of benefits they accrue. A UBI fixes this and actually provides [a higher marginal return to earning an income](https://surlysubgroup.com/2016/06/13/universal-bassic-income-and-marginal-rates/).
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.1. Pro: In the US, the effective marginal tax rates on the poor [are often as high as 109% of their income](https://surlysubgroup.com/2016/06/13/universal-bassic-income-and-marginal-rates/) because of the corresponding reduction in welfare benefits as they earn more.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.2. Pro: The small increase in income from getting a minimum wage job, at the cost of hours of free time, often does not motivate unemployed people to find one. A UBI, retained when entering the workforce, provides better incentive.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.3. Pro: A UBI will fix the threshold and [poverty trap](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poverty-trap.asp) effects induced by the current means-tested schemes.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.3.1. Pro: Welfare is a system that is built to merely keep people on sustenance, and never provides them with the resources to pull themselves out of poverty.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.3.1.1. Con: The alternative to a UBI is not just status quo welfare but rather using all of the money that would go towards a UBI to massively expand welfare. This means welfare could include things such as education, which would allow people to escape poverty.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.3.1.2. Pro: Benefits received from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \(SNAP\) are [not enough](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/03/03/468955099/the-snap-gap-benefits-arent-enough-to-keep-many-recipients-fed) to keep most beneficiaries fed. Many families are still forced to visit a food pantry each month.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.3.2. Pro: Most existing means-tested anti-poverty schemes exclude people because of their complexity, or because people don’t know how to apply or whether they qualify. With a UBI, people currently excluded from benefit allowances will automatically have their rights guaranteed.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.3.3. Pro: [The Speenhamland system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speenhamland_system) was a form of outdoor relief intended to mitigate rural poverty in England at the end of the 18th century and during the early 19th century. It was the first UBI experiment and it was at the time very successful.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.3.3.1. Con: The speenhamland system \(Berkshire Bread Act\) was a welfare system, not a UBI. Poor families were given extra money by the parish to top up wages enough to buy bread.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.4. Pro: UBI does not punish those of lower classes who begin to earn more money, but instead keeps the incentive to move up in income to the point where UBI is no longer necessary for the individual. Therefore this saves the government more money over time in welfare spending.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.5. Con: Even if the existing welfare schemes are \(supposedly\) worse than UBIs, welfare schemes could be improved so that the disincentive to increase income is not as steep as the [\(1999\) source](https://www.epionline.org/wp-content/studies/shaviro_02-1999.pdf) of the [parent's source](https://surlysubgroup.com/2016/06/13/universal-bassic-income-and-marginal-rates/) illustrates. In other words, traditional welfare programs could be fixed rather than eliminated and replaced with UBI.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.5.1. Con: This argument is a status quo bias. It adresses only one of the current wellfare system's shortcomings but maintains that it should be preserved to avert change.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.5.2. Pro: If the main problem with current welfare is the disincentive to work, a reworked version of [workfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workfare) can solve that problem without the need for the high cost of a UBI. Requiring some level of employment before social benefits supplement that income \(for those physically and mentally able\) incentivizes employment and reduces overall welfare costs because the government is only supplementing, not providing the income.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.5.2.1. Con: Invisible disabilities, or those who have difficulty proving their disability \(or do not have full information about the availability of schemes\), could easily slip through the cracks. A UBI allows no cracks by including every individual.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.6. Pro: UBI would correct the unintended consequence of broken families and encourage marriage and stable family structure. Current welfare discourages marriage as evidenced by the rise in single mother households whereas UBI would not penalize a single mother for the added income of a spouse but instead encourage the combining of incomes through marriage.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.6.1. Con: Providing for the people through government is destructive of families, as it directly competes with or purports to replace [the responsibility](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/gen/3.19) of [fathers to provide](https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation?lang=eng&old=true) for their families.
There is [no more economical way](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aparnamathur/2015/10/30/the-family-foundations-of-economic-growth/#3a60007a2a9b) to live than in intact families as the fundamental provident unit of society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.6.2. Con: Traditional welfare systems can exist which are neutral or even incentivize marriage.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.6.2.1. Pro: In the UK it was historically very beneficial to be married, although it is now rather neutral, [due to](https://www.money.co.uk/guides/how-will-getting-married-affect-your-finances.htm) married couples/marriage allowance, tax bracket sharing, and tax free gifts.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.6.2.2. Pro: Many countries, [like Germany](https://www.expattax.de/marriage-tax-classes-germany/), have joint taxation. This benefits married couples who can choose to submit taxes together, meaning they can often share unused tax credits.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.6.2.3. Pro: Proposed changes to the Swiss marriage tax model make getting married [more financially beneficial](http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/switzerland-abolition-of-marriage-tax-penalty-proposed/) than being an unmarried couple.  It also adds financial incentive for couples with children to get married.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.6.3. Con: Much of any marriage penalty comes from tax changes, rather than welfare, because most couples are not on welfare. 

UBI would not affect the taxation system, and therefore would not have as much of an impact on marriage incentives as a tax reform world.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.6.4. Con: Increasing numbers of single mother households just suggests that relationships are not lasting as long.

If a correlation was to be drawn between current welfare systems and lack of marriage, we should look at numbers of unmarried couples, not single mothers.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.6.5. Con: A UBI would not encourage combining of incomes through marriage, as any family would get the same benefits even if they stayed as an unmarried couple.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.2. Pro: Personal and societal incentives for financial responsibility are only eroded if programs are designed for people to become not-eligible after they surpass a certain income. Since UBI is free from this restriction, people will always have the incentive to get more income than the basic, for the same reasons that most people in society do not settle for minimum wage jobs.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.3. Pro: People would still receive an incentive by the extra income generated from their job.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.3.1. Pro: A UBI is unlikely to inhibit someone like Steve Jobs or Bill Gates from their passions. If there are creative people out there, a UBI would give them time to work on what is important to them so they are free to be more creative, instead of working an unrewarding job.
1.1.5.2.11.1.12.4. Pro: On the contrary, a UBI incentivizes financial responsibility since it is a minimal amount to survive, it allows and empowers self-improvement allowing people to survive through re-training and education periods when they are not productive to the economy, and it empowers those who want to start their own businesses with a survival cushion that sets entrepreneurs free to create new businesses.
1.1.5.2.11.1.13. Con: The claim a UBI erodes personal incentives for self-improvement and hard work ignores the psychological and/or sociological components of these traits. It assumes such desires are externally motivated. These traits are likely a mix of internal and external factors. For those highly internally motivated, UBI is less likely to substantially change their behavior.
1.1.5.2.11.1.13.1. Pro: There are other incentives for self-improvement, such as a sense of accomplishment or mastery.
1.1.5.2.11.1.13.1.1. Pro: However, a UBI would force us to think about other options than financial incentives like personal growth and benefits for society .
1.1.5.2.11.1.13.1.2. Pro: Not all people are motivated or incentivized by profit.
1.1.5.2.11.1.13.2. Pro: The thesis presupposes that human beings are primarily motivated by their own consumption - that they only do anything if it increases their ability to consume. But humans are primarily motivated by an existential calling. After all, one would not be interested in sustaining their  life if it did not have meaning for them.
1.1.5.2.11.1.13.2.1. Pro: Most people do not consider the meaning or purpose of their life to be to accrue wealth, and instead accrue wealth in service of other goals.
1.1.5.2.11.1.13.3. Pro: In the last years the concept of gamification emerged. It shows that motivation often has nothing to do with money, but rather people can develop a desired behavior through an activity that is meaningful. This can reward people without necessarily using money to do so.
1.1.5.2.11.1.14. Con: It depends in what kind of society you live. In a society where the will of the collective comes before the will of the individual, your claim may show itself fail. How could your claim even explain volunteer work if all that matter is money? There are more them just money that leads people to produce something, or "work" for those who prefer this word.
1.1.5.2.11.1.15. Con: This claim presumes that "financial responsibility" and "hard work" are essential to the functionality or benefit of society. However, it ignores the growth of automation of jobs. As automation increases, and unemployment grows, UBI will be necessary to forestall catastrophic economic inequality and to enable personal growth and flourishing.
1.1.5.2.11.1.15.1. Con: While "financial responsibility" and "hard work" may not be as useful in the future as they are now, it would be foolish to abandon them before we actually have the automated infrastructure to safely let them go as virtues.
1.1.5.2.11.1.15.1.1. Con: Yes, it would be foolish to let go of such virtues, but this could be tacked by, educating the masses on how to cope with the major shift and how to focus more on self development, now that they are free to do so.
1.1.5.2.11.1.15.2. Pro: UBI creates the space for "hard word" and "financial stability" to be replaced with "creative output" and "network solutions". Rather than amassing more things, we can strive towards a society that is highly resilient and self-sustainable. The churn of automation would be less of a threat, because more people would be safe to pursue self-employment.
1.1.5.2.11.1.15.3. Con: UBI is simply a mechanism to maintain the rich/poor divide and not an attempt to bridge it. UBI will only prolong a dependence on a financial social ranking. Society has surpassed the need to rank individuals by wealth however we/the world still rely on this outdated system.
1.1.5.2.11.1.15.3.1. Con: Not having money is maintaining the rich/poor divide. Ubi wouldn't change it completely, but it would at least give the people a chance to move up.
1.1.5.2.11.1.16. Con: Some of the hardest working jobs have the lowest pay. And the very wealthy have to do relatively little to invest their large capital in such a way as to get large returns. Hard work and reward do not correlate.
1.1.5.2.11.1.16.1. Con: Hard work is not limited to physically hard work. Achieving "large returns" on investments consistently is very hard work, although not physical.
1.1.5.2.11.1.16.2. Con: “Hard work” is the wrong term. Work which has higher societal benefits would be more accurate. Athletes \(professional game players\) produce no material goods, but they are paid millions because people enjoy watching them. Investment banking isn’t physically hard work but is an important engine in growing the domestic economy.
1.1.5.2.11.1.16.2.1. Con: Investmant bankers spurred the 2008 financial crisis. Collateralized debt obligations and preditory lending allowed bankers to leverage their risk onto the pockets of tax payers in pursuit of personal profit. Their actions did not help American society. Skilled trades people help grow society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.16.3. Con: "Hard work" is an ambiguous term. It can mean physically taxing work - this indeed does not correlate with pay. But "hard" can also mean "hard to learn/acquire necessary skills" - in this meaning hardness does correlate with pay.
1.1.5.2.11.1.16.4. Con: If individuals are resentful of the current circumstance for reasons like low-return labor, then reducting that resentment by eliminating those positions with a UBI does not contribute to decreased productivity and societal incentive. The threat to societal incentive pertains to increased opportunity space.
1.1.5.2.11.1.16.5. Pro: Additionally, there are many high earners in rent seeking industries like lobbying and arguably, to some extent, investment banking. These roles do not contribute to the social good and more often than not, detract from it.
1.1.5.2.11.1.17. Con: A UBI is a fairer alternative to most welfare programs because everyone gets it — not just the people who need it the most which could be interpreted as rewarding incompetence/laziness.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18. Pro: A work guarantee is preferable to a UBI because work can and does give people a sense of purpose and meaning in life, identity, self-worth and social contact.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1. Con: A UBI reduces the stigma of social welfare, because the payments are distributed to everyone in society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.1. Pro: Those most in need are spared the degrading experience of pleading with welfare officers on a regular basis that they fit into specific categories.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.1.1. Con: Given the harmful effects of poverty in general, having to justify your need \(even in a degrading way\) is far from the biggest issue facing the poor.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.1.2. Con: It is often quite simple to prove that one is entitled to a welfare payout by providing proof of unemployment, or showing an insufficient income.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.1.3. Con: Communities are organized geographically based on socio-economic conditions and it is often an entire neighborhood that is on welfare. Proving one is part of a specific category is less degrading, because perceptively it is seen as a common experience, rather than a uniquely degrading one.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.1.4. Con: We can likely tailor the current system to make admittance into a welfare program a more private affair done electronically or by mail.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.2. Con: Stigma is caused by a certain thing's association with low status individuals or groups: in a society with a mature UBI tradition, and perhaps in one where UBI is new as well, being known to rely on UBI would be just as shameful as relying on welfare is in the real world.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.2.1. Con: Money is inherently fungible, so the source is readily obscured where necessary, while foodstamps are obviously foodstamps.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.3. Con: Stigma likely [arises](https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=SOPSL7y4cRYC&pg=RA1-PT121&lpg=RA1-PT121&dq=welfare+stigma+taxpayer+resentment&source=bl&ots=LKEKmQKU_Z&sig=1hRl3JJ3nS6Mv5H6GOjzM96EEDQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXrMzPosDQAhUOR48KHYepDzMQ6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&q=welfare%20stigma%20taxpayer%20resentment&f=false) from individuals being unable to work or being perceived as taking more from the collective resource pool than they give. This perception is getting traction in states experiencing an electoral backlash against liberal values.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.3.1. Pro: A UBI will entrench stigma against entire groups rather than remove it. Middle class individuals who imagine themselves to be hardworking will feel resentment at having a vastly increased tax rate to fund UBI payments for discriminated minorities.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.3.1.2. Pro: The nature of [government spending means that](http://thespinoff.co.nz/featured/31-03-2016/i-love-the-idea-of-a-universal-basic-income-but-heres-the-problem/) a UBI could be only two of: 1\) Generous enough to substitute for existing welfare systems, 2\) Have low phase-out rates that do not heavily penalise work, and 3\) Not cost an order of magnitude more than current welfare programs. Given most UBI's are strictly universal \(2\) either \(3\) or \(1\) must apply.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: For the UBI to not leave the most needy welfare recipients worse-off it would need to cover the costs of overlapping entitlements, which would cost far above the poverty line — [up to $22,000 in the case of New Zealand](https://thespinoff.co.nz/featured/31-03-2016/i-love-the-idea-of-a-universal-basic-income-but-heres-the-problem/).
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: An 'affordable' UBI that does not fully replace the existing targeted means of welfare distribution \(i.e. one that is supplemented by other targeted schemes\) retains many of the existing issues with poverty traps, inefficient distribution and high costs.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.3.1.3. Pro: Many democracies have shown themselves to be chronically unable to raise taxes as they distribute benefits. Policymakers want to be seen as the bringer of carrots rather than the wielder of sticks.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: As governments fail to raise taxes, this would lead to an ever-increasing debt, allowing for interest to build, meaning that eventually, not even basic services could function without more tax hikes, and whomever was left with the fiscal mess would receive all the blame for it.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.4. Pro: Targeted welfare often entrenches Darwinian narratives about those in poverty, particularly where ethnic minorities are overwhelmingly overrepresented in those statistics. This increases discrimination in social interactions and also reduces political capital for useful measures.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.4.1. Con: It is more realistic that targeted welfare entrenches the narrative that there are specific groups of people who are in special need of assistance, and that it is the state's obligation to assist these people, not that this assistance is a result of some kind of evolutionary deficit.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.4.2. Con: Seeing which minority groups correlate with the type of, and need for, welfare, provides us with valuable data about how much inequality still exists in society. A UBI limits our ability to gain and use this data to fight said inequality.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.4.2.1. Con: Government studies and surveys about income distribution across the population are still a powerful tool to determine inequality. Those studies can still be conducted with a UBI.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.4.2.2. Con: A UBI may limit data that demonstrates inequality, but only to the extent that it actually reduces inequality.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.5. Pro: Middle class voters are more likely to accept a tax hike for a UBI because they actually see some return from this policy.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.5.1. Con: If the tax hike is higher than the UBI payout, middle class voters are paying more than they are receiving, and will know that their money is going to people who may not even be working. This in turn reinforces stigmas against the poor.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.6. Pro: This benefits the people who need it most \(those that do not have money or capabilities to access welfare programs\), because the program goes to them instead of them going to the program.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.7. Pro: People often do not take governmental assistance, because there is a stigma associated with receiving them.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.8. Pro: The reduction of social stigma might help people get jobs more easily, as employers might not hire people who receive governmental benefits.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.8.1. Pro: An employer might not hire someone if 1\) if the applicant cannot manage their lives, then they cannot handle a job, 2\) an applicant receiving benefits might make the company look bad \(like the company does not pay enough, which is why they're on stamps\), 3\) the applicant cannot pay for the job's image \(like business suits, cars for transport...\)
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.9. Con: A UBI assigns a specific and clear monetary value to welfare, which feeds into classist rhetoric, making easier for some people to complain about wastefulness.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.10. Pro: Existing welfare systems have a burdensome set of conditions and application processes.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.10.1. Pro: Conditions in social payments are a source of inefficiency, since they amount to qualifications which need to be validated.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.11. Con: On the other hand, everyone would be wards of the state, inverting the relationship between the People and the federal government established by the Constitution.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.2. Con: Currently unpaid roles such as parenting and caring for loved ones/family, would continue to be unvalued with a work guarantee. The UBI would give carers this sense of purpose, self-worth and social contact that they deserve.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.2.1. Con: A UBI would not directly change the social status or recognition of unpaid family roles.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.3. Con: A UBI is preferable to a work guarantee because it allows people to define for themselves what they see as a sense of purpose, meaning in life, identity etc. whether that be work or something else which is most likely still useful.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.3.1. Pro: People will work harder and be more motivated when working towards goals they personally understand, identify with and/or see the value in.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.4. Con: With increasing automation, it may not be possible to give meaningful jobs to every person in a society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.5. Con: A work guarantee will create distortions in the marketplace and waste of human resources as it necessarily requires the government to create otherwise unneeded jobs.
1.1.5.2.11.1.18.5.1. Con: There would be no shortage of necessary jobs if the government prioritized sustainable energy solutions and crisis relief.
1.1.5.2.11.1.19. Con: This is assuming societies' priorities should be the same as capitalism. Priorities shift towards societal & human gains.
1.1.5.2.11.1.19.1. Con: Without capitalism, society would not be in a position to shift its priorities towards societal & human rights. Without capitalism there is no high standard of living.
1.1.5.2.11.1.19.1.1. Con: Capitalism is only one factor in the global evolution of the human condition; factors like democracy, culture, and societal values are also highly relevant, as are scientific and technological advancements. It is inappropriate to attribute today's quality of life entirely to capitalism.
1.1.5.2.11.1.19.1.2. Con: This is true until automation becomes the new standard. Then the society standard of living will need to change.
1.1.5.2.11.1.19.2. Pro: These incentives are not needed by our society anymore as norms and customs change over time.
1.1.5.2.11.1.19.2.1. Con: While it is true that changes in norms produce \(and demand different incentives\), the economic structure of developed countries \(and human psychology\) has not changed anywhere near enough to deprecate these fundamental incentives
1.1.5.2.11.1.19.3. Con: Self-improvement and hard work are not essential tenets of capitalism: they are consequences of it. We can have a conversation about disciplining an exercise routine using the same tools of language as in developing a venture capital and both practices can be objectively irrespective of each other.
1.1.5.2.11.1.20. Con: If there is some requirement to contribute to society in some way \(work, volunteer, go to school, create art, start a business, teach, mentor people, join the military, etc.\), the government could use the program to encourage people to contribute to society in specific ways.
1.1.5.2.11.1.20.1. Con: If work is required for a UBI, it goes against the premise of a UBI which is provide a living wage for all without work needed. It therefore becomes a “fast track” of sorts to get a job. However, we currently have more positions available for work than unemployed. If the person wanted a job, the opportunities are available right now and a UBI wouldn’t be needed.
1.1.5.2.11.1.20.1.1. Con: In Australia, the ratio of unemployed workers to jobs can get as high as [18:1](http://unemployedworkersunion.com/job-seekers-v-job-vacancy-data/).
1.1.5.2.11.1.21. Con: A UBI encourages personal an societal incentives and encourages self-improvement and responsibility because it provides the ability to develop those values instead of requiring people focus on mere survival.
1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1. Pro: A basic income would provide a person with multiple chances to become financially literate. Currently, without affluent parents or any other sturdy safety net, one or two bad decisions or unlucky outcomes can be a slippery slope into debt and/or poverty.
1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.1. Con: UBI is unnecessary when it comes to teaching someone personal financial responsibility. Any interaction with money is a learning opportunity, especially when the person has earned it.
1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.1.1. Con: People should not be penalized, or worse, suffer, for the rest of their lives over mistakes made early - which is possible without a sufficient safety net like a UBI or sufficient welfare.
1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.2. Con: UBI doesn't prevent a person from spending beyond their means or accruing debts they are unable to pay.
1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.2.1. Con: It does, however, provide a safety net for gradually recovering from the results of doing so, and provides a second chance once the lesson is learned - which is what the original claim is arguing.
1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.2.2. Con: Unless you restrict what people are allowed to spend their money on, this applies equally to any other income, from employment or otherwise.
1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.3. Pro: With the basic needs of the people covered by UBI, they can focus more time on experimentation and gathering experience.
1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.4. Pro: UBI provides people with economic security which allows them to follow their dreams easier and also invest more. Thats because if they fail they will still have the basic finances needed to survive.
1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.4.1. Pro: A UBI assists small businesses by allowing genuinely interested parties to devote more of their time, effort, and attention to the business rather than having to worry about their own employment and financial security.
1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.5. Con: Good decision makers should not be forced to provide financial support to poor decision makers.
1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.5.1. Con: Humans should not be damned to suffering and hardship for single mistakes, or even a series of mistakes. "Rescue" and education efforts should always be made.
1.1.5.2.11.1.22. Pro: People will lose motivation for work. As a citizen of a developed country, it would be perfectly possible to take the UBI and move to countries with lower standards and live on it without contributing anything.
1.1.5.2.11.1.22.1. Con: Being able to recieve UBI from one country while living in another is a problem that would be easy enough to solve.
1.1.5.2.11.1.22.1.1. Pro: UBI would have to be either universal for the entire planet and thus invalidate the claim, or would be governed by individual countries and could be dropped for those who are not there.
1.1.5.2.11.1.22.2. Con: This can be remedied by only providing UBI to citizens currently staying in the country.
1.1.5.2.11.1.22.3. Con: It is possible for sure to be an ex-patriot and scam the system, but it won't be easy for someone with little money. The whole point of UBI is to motivate people to be able to put themselves in a better place in society. \(E.g., 1. A female can leave abusive husband because UBI provides necessary costs. 2. A graduate with student loans who accepts any job to be able to pay the loan back could instead focus on getting a job they went to school for.\)
1.1.5.2.11.1.23. Con: It could actually do the very opposite. By giving people financial safety but still fixed, yet good amount, people will have to be very responsible and more understanding with their money from a younger age.
1.1.5.2.11.1.24. Con: Free Market Capitalism is based on “meritocracy” and hierarchies. It is the desire to reach the top of a given hierarchy that drives the needle of progress and innovation.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25. Pro: A UBI is immoral.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.4.12.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.2. Pro: A UBI takes resources from one individual to give them to another with no product or service in exchange, and without permission. That is the definition of theft; theft is immoral. Therefore a UBI is immoral.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.2.1. Con: There is a service in exchange: Poverty is reduced. Please bear in mind that poverty is not only the sum of missing money of the poor people, but there is also a huge amount of money spent for poor people \(health, infrastructure, in rare cases even crime cost\). Investing in giving poor people a life with more dignity would prove money well spent.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.2.1.1. Con: Whether it would be money well spent or not is a matter of opinion, not fact.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.2.1.2. Con: Poverty being reduced is not a service to the person whose money is confiscated to pay for it. It's a service to the poor. The discussion isn't about whether helping the poor is a good thing or not, it's about a specific method of helping. If someone wants to help the poor, they absolutely should do so through free will charity. If they don't want to, they shouldn't be forced to. A UBI is how that force is applied, and it's immoral to do so.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3. Pro: A UBI incapacitates citizens as it creates a \(financial\) dependency on the state.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.1. Pro: The poor will be more reliant on the state if the only method they have for reducing inequality is through state provision. This creates a perverse incentive to not challenge the state or demand social change.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.1.1. Con: A UBI would not disincentivize the poor to challenge the state, rather they might have new challenges that do not concern economics anymore, but rather social or political issues.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.1.2. Con: People retain all the mechanisms to enact social change that already exist; this policy does not limit their abilities.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.1.3. Con: The poor are already reliant on the state, and usually have to "earn" their welfare through makework, such as seeking and applying for jobs that they have no chance of getting. Removing this requirement makes them less dependent on the state, because they can take chances on jobs or enterprises without facing destitution if they fail.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.2. Pro: Citizens will become reliant on the UBI once they start using it to support ongoing business or personal projects. This creates a dependency and thus a bargaining chip for governments.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.3. Con: Modern social welfare structures currently exist, with strings attached — you can't be homeless and get housing assistance, you need to be in college to get pell grants, and you must be working to get the earned income tax credit etc. By equalizing the payments and removing the strings attached to social programs, the influence of politicians and bureaucrats is lessened relative to the status quo.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.4. Con: Public subsidies for business \(like arts programs\) are currently used as bargaining chips by governments. Restructuring those into a UBI \(welfare for people instead of corporations\) would remove bargaining chips from the hand of governments.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.4.1. Con: Social programs addressing the needs of individuals are also used as bargaining chips by governments.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.4.1.1. Con: As a UBI is universal and unconditional, it could not be used as such.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.5. Con: Every single entity within a society is dependent on the state. It is called the social contract.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.5.1. Con: The degree of the dependency varies strongly.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.5.1.1. Con: Even the wealthiest of people are at the mercy of chance, nature, and crime without the state making sure they are not victims and/or helping them recover fro such events \(e.g. rebuilding disaster zones, policing, firefighting etc\). People tend to underestimate these guarantees given by the state and take them for granted thinking they are not dependent on them when in fact everyone is just as dependent. If anything the dependence of the wealthy could be even greater as they have more to lose.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.6. Pro: Multiple generations of UBI could lead to dependence on a delicate system that requires a lot of social cooperation to sustain. If this system ever collapses because subsequent generations take it for granted, the effects could be disastrous.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.6.1. Con: This argument applies to many other systems, like schools, firemen, police, social security, etc. That did not stop previous generations from creating those systems. There are cases around the world where these systems have indeed collapsed, with disastrous consequences; but the people recognize they are necessary and try really hard to re-establish them. A UBI would probably enter in that category if it is created.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.6.2. Pro: This is already happening with social security and other entitlement programs. UBI could follow suit.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.7. Pro: A UBI creates a fragile core centered around global government in a high-tension time in history. This core could collapse at any moment and create catastrophe.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.8. Pro: A UBI would disallows an individual to attain a higher standard of life by trapping them within a limited income and lifestyle. By issuing a limited income, people will come to rely on that income solely. Assuming that welfare would remain in many countries, there would be even less incentive to improve ones life and lifestyle. Many poor and uneducated are content to keep status quo, but the ones that would "Dream" of something better, would ultimately lose.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.8.1. Con: Individuals desiring a higher quality of life or additional goods and services could always still earn money through paid employment.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.8.1.1. Pro: This would be actively advertised and encouraged by businesses seeking employees, who must now compete for labour as people are not beholden to them merely for their living expenses.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.9. Pro: In essence, a UBI creates a [nanny state](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/nanny+state) through finances.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4. Pro: A taxation-funded UBI is an involuntary wealth transfer, and welfare redistribution schemes are equivalent to crime.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.1. Con: If taxation is equivalent to, and enforced as a crime, no modern state would be able to function.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.1.1. Con: A state that sustains itself by violating the rights and freedoms it was built to defend undermines its purpose.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.1.2. Con: Read the claim carefully, taxes for an involuntary wealth transfer are equivalent to crime, not all taxes.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.2. Con: Given taxation and redistribution policies are widespread, there is no reason to hold a UBI in particular to a different standard.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.2.1. Con: Prevalence is no proof of legitimacy.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.2.2. Con: Taxation and redistribution policies are unethical, as they confiscate the individual's property without the it's consent. UBI is based on taxation, and is a kind of redistribution policy, so it is unethical too.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.2.2.1. Con: Permitting suffering and death due to poverty is cruel and immoral.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.2.2.1.1. Con: UBI is economic suicide and will put more people in poverty when it quickly becomes unaffordable and the country defaults on its debt.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.2.3. Con: This discussion is about a UBI though. No different standard is held, all wealth redistribution programs are immoral and equivalent to theft.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.2.4. Con: Not all taxes are immoral. Defense is a service rendered to all people, and it would be near impossible for the military to selectively defend people. Therefore all people should have to pay for that service. Infrastructure, like roads, are a good that all people benefit from, therefore all people should have to pay for that good. Taxes for these purposes are not immoral. but taxes for a wealth redistribution scheme like UBI, welfare, etc. are. UBI isn't being held to a different standard.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.3. Con: The nature of political power in democratic society is that it involves individuals giving up power over one aspect of your life in order to gain benefits in the other.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.3.1. Con: Individuals don't give up their power voluntarily, even if they are immensely better off with a democratic society. This is unethical and immoral.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.3.2. Con: Not all wealthy countries are democratic.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.3.3. Con: No benefit is gained by the person paying the tax for the UBI. Nor any tax based wealth redistribution program for that matter.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.4. Con: Taxes aren't crimes. They are simply citizens paying for the services their goverment provides.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.4.1. Con: Taxes are the involuntary apropriation of a part of an individual's wealth. A theft is the involuntary apropriation of a part of an individual's wealth. Taxes equal theft, and if society legitimates taxes, it is legitimating theft.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.4.1.1. Con: Taxes are the legitimate exercise of one of a government's legitimate functions, which is to provide public services from public funds for the maintenance of society. Members within a society exist in that society, not in isolation, and benefit from their position within that society. It is reasonable and ethical for individuals to contribute, and be expected to contribute, towards maintenance of the society they are a part of and benefit from.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.4.2. Pro: Governments defend people's right to private property, which could otherwise be breached in any number of ways \(theft, financially motivated murder...\) without consequence. In order to provide this protection, it is necessary for governments to source funding somehow. This is the principle behind taxes, which are not immoral in this light.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.4.2.1. Con: But you've created a false equivalency and a straw man. The claim is that "Taxation for a wealth redistribution scheme is equivalent to crime". Not that all taxes are equivalent to crime. You've chosen a specific tax that actually provides a service to the person paying the tax. In the case of a UBI, the person paying the tax receives no good or service in return.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.4.3. Con: Note the claim states that taxation specifically for involuntary wealth transfers are EQUIVALENT to crime, in that case specifically theft. More specifically, even if theft wasn't considered a crime for some odd reason\(anarchic society\), it would still be immoral.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.5. Con: Taxation is not theft given democracy defines the rule of law. Our law defines what is criminal and what isn't, meaning that legal taxation cannot be seen as a crime.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.5.1. Pro: The costs and benefits of taxation can hardly be crimes if they exist by the assent of the majority of the voting population.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.5.1.1. Con: This assumes that democracy and criminality are equivalent to morality. Democracies can and do act in immoral and criminal ways.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.5.1.2. Con: The majority should not be able to decide what to do with an individual's resources. That's immoral, and demotivational. The US founding fathers recognized that they had to do something to protect minorities, that's why the senate exists.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.5.2. Con: The claim you're attempting to refute states it is equivalent to crime, not that it is crime. It also doesn't state that all taxation is equivalent to crime, but that wealth redistribution schemes are equivalent to crime.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.6. Pro: Poverty is the default state of human existence; confiscating property from one to give to another is immoral regardless of good intentions.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.6.1. Con: It could be argued that the very basis of property is immoral, and baseless, but it does make for a useful idea. Taxes do as well.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.6.2. Con: Allowing preventable harm is also immoral. A UBI is one way of addressing the preventable harm caused by the current financial system and wealth distribution.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.6.2.1. Con: Allowing preventable harm is not immoral in every case.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: Were it different, nobody could in practice be moral - as there's always somebody in need of help from harm. It's an impossible standard.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.7. Pro: A UBI is set on the premise of a right to another person's work without their consent, i.e. slavery, and is therefore unethical.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.8. Pro: A UBI is a "means to an end" policy, where stealing is justified on the basis of knowing better and only the possibility, but no guarantee, of achieving an ends.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9. Pro: A UBI cannot exist without confiscating money \(at gunpoint\) from some people and giving it to others. It is theft, and therefore 100% immoral.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.1. Con: The criminality of a tax would necessarily translate to all forms of taxes.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.1.1. Con: Not true, that's like saying the criminality of an action would necessarily translate to all forms of actions, therefore if murder is illegal, then so is jumping. No, a tax specifically for wealth redistribution schemes is immoral and should be criminal. A tax for a public good\(one that is nonrivalrous and nonexcludable\) is fine.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.2. Con: Unlike other groups of people, the wealthy have the luxury of choosing where they live, and moving if they disagree with a countries' policies.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.2.1. Con: In the case of a UBI, it's not just the wealthy that end up paying for it though. Wealth distribution roughly follows a Pareto distribution, meaning that even the lower middle class will end up paying. Furthermore, if everyone above a certain income line left to avoid the tax, the UBI wouldn't have the wealthy to draw funding from and the middle class would have to pay even more, causing more people to flee, until all your left with is the poor that couldn't afford to leave.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.3. Con: Forcing people at gun point to live in a system increasingly rigged against them until they descend into slavery, which is the current state of affairs, is more immoral then some think taxes are.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.3.1. Con: You're assuming the system is rigged against someone.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.3.2. Con: You're assuming that a system rigged against someone, will become further rigged against them.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.3.3. Con: You're assuming the conclusion, descent into slavery, and declaring that the current state of affairs without any supporting evidence.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.3.4. Con: The proper way to fix immorality isn't to create another.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.3.5. Con: There is no law forcing someone to live in poverty.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4. Con: There is no inherent right to property, especially when that property wasn't earned by the one who holds it, as is often the case of the wealthy. Taxes are merely the government ending its lease on communal property lent to an individual.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4.1. Pro: These leases encourage people to develop the property in question, and facilitates optimization of resources.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4.2. Pro: A UBI isn't about an inherent right to property, it's about an inherent right to life. Life isn't possible without shelter, food, health care, personal fulfillment. One may disagree about certain components, but a UBI facilitates life not property.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4.2.1. Con: The right to live only means no one can take life from you; not that everybody has to guarantee you the necessities for living.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4.2.1.1. Con: It could be argued that humans have a moral obligation to look out for the lives and healths of those less fortunate. The UBI would be a government sanctioned and facilitated way of doing so. The government is, after all, representative of the people \(under an ideally functioning democratic system\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4.2.1.1.1. Con: By definition any moral actions can't be obligatory, since morality is the act of choosing the action which gives the greater sum of happiness when you have the choice to choose other actions with lower sum. Moral obligations are a contradiction.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Moral obligation is a common concept.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4.2.1.2. Con: Many believe that humans should be entitled to the basic necessities of life.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4.2.2. Con: The right to live is included in property rights, as your body is your property. As Henrique Campos has said: "The right to live only means no one can take life from you; not that everybody has to guarantee you the necessities for living".
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4.3. Con: Property must be an inherent right. You own yourself. You own the things you make. You own the things you trade for. What you do with what you own is your choice and no one else's.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4.4. Con: This claim "There is no inherent right to property" is extremely dangerous, as it tries to legitimate slavery. The only people on earth that do not have an inherent right to property are the slaves.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.4.4.1. Con: No. If nobody has right to property, nobody has right to own anyone else. One can oppose both property and slavery.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.5. Pro: All tax collection, ultimately, is enforced by the threat of State violence if people refuse to comply.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.5.1. Con: All of society is enforced by a [monopoly on state violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence).
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.6. Con: Governments can in fact print more money, although it's true that if this was the sole source of the UBI, it would be unsustainable.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.6.1. Con: Printing more money directly causes inflation, a UBI based on inflationary printing of money would only make everyone poorer. Then again, I suppose that's what a UBI is supposed to do, make everyone equally poor.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.7. Pro: A universal welfare could only be funded with significant sales and/or income taxes. Such taxes require throwing anyone who refuses to disclose how much currency they received in private trade, and to hand over a share of that currency to the government, in prison, where they are kept in a small enclosure and subjected to dehumanizing conditions.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.7.1. Con: If a UBI was similar in outcome to current welfare rates, and taxes were modified to alllow for the UBI, the effect on taxes would be neutral, and may indeed save a little as there would be no need for the apparatus of checking that a potential recipient is destitute or otherwise entitled to receive assistance. The second part of the claim is an attack on the concept of taxation in general, and irrelevant to discussion of UBI.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.7.1.1. Con: Assuming the UBI was similar in outcome to current welfare rates, then no modification to the taxes would be required.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.7.1.2. Con: If you remove the apparatus of checking that a potential recipient entitled to the payment, and assume the UBI was similar in outcome to current welfare rates, then you're splitting a payment that currently only those who are entitled to welfare get out to everyone. Those currently on welfare\(the ones a UBI is designed to help\) would be worse off. Those currently not on welfare would be better off, basically receiving a refund on their current tax rate. Where do I sign up?
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.8. Pro: The means by which a UBI is procured and redistributed, through involuntary taxation enforced by threat of government violence, is unethical.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.8.1. Con: Taxes are not ordinarily enforced through threat of government violence - taxes intended for a UBI should not be any different, unless individuals initiate armed resistance.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.8.1.1. Con: In this case, you're assuming that imprisonment isn't a form of violence. All taxes both the moral and immoral ones are collected by threat of imprisonment.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.9. Con: Tax money is not generally obtained through threat of violence, rather legal means.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.9.1. Con: You're playing a semantic game, the phrase "at gunpoint" here is perhaps heavy handed, but is meant that the government will punish you if you don't comply. As in if you refuse to pay the tax, you'll go to jail. So you're options are to have your money confiscated unwillingly or go to jail. Try to argue the merits rather than the semantics.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.10. Pro: It's unethical to use force as a means of redistrubing private property. UBI can only be provided by massively increased taxes, denial to comply would result in use of force. You don't have a right to the fruits of other peoples labor.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.10.1. Con: All fruits of peoples labor occur in a context of state investment. Whether that be roads you use to get to work, the education you utilized to give you those skills etc.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.10.1.1. Con: The state is funded by the people, e.g. roads are paid for by the very people that use them and education is paid for by the same people that get the education. In fact, it would probably be more efficient to remove the state from the equation, and have privately funded roads and privately funded education. In a way roads and education are a UBI used only for those specific purposes, but when those that have money fund the roads and education of those without it's still unethical.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.10.1.1.1. Con: Wealthy people pay more for society than poor \<- this sounds very ethical. If poor people would have to pay the same, this sounds unethical. \(Also most religions state the same.\)
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.9.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.2.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.10. Pro: A UBI further consolidates goverment's power which in turn robs the citizens of theirs. A gap in power always leads to a gap in wealth. Consider the federal government has already targeted its citizenry with the IRS without consequence.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.10.1. Con: The government is the people. It being stronger gives the people more power against over-bloated corporations that attempt to control their lives without their input.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.10.1.1. Pro: Corporations serve no interest but profit. The government should at least in theory be subservient to the wishes and best interests of the general public.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.10.2. Con: It has not, so far, been possible to operate a society without some form of government, and for that government to have expenses. It may be that those expenses could be met by voluntary contributions, but there does not seem to be any society where this has successfully happened.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11. Pro: Freedom is the state of not being imprisoned or enslaved and being able to act think or speak as one wants. UBI requires the enforcement of taxation, which by definition, impairs freedom.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11.1. Pro: The additional purchasing power that net beneficiaries gain from UBI has to be taken from those who are net payers. The latter group's freedom is reduced because they have less control over the fruits of their labor.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11.1.1. Con: For most state's considering implementing a UBI, a social welfare system in already in place. If those systems are replaced with a UBI, the net payer's group freedom is not reduced any more than it already is. And the beneficiaries gain the freedom to choose how their UBI is spent.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11.1.1.1. Con: This is only true if taxation stayed the same as without UBI. However, most UBI models require substantial increase in spending compared to the current welfare state, and thus would require more taxation.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11.1.1.1.1. Pro: Tax reforms to support a UBI would need to be highly progressive and focus on taxing luxury items.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This could be argued to be a desirable and effective way for the tax system to operate, as it would tax the wealthy who could afford it to support those who are in need for essentials.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11.1.2. Con: There is no such thing as the isolated fruits of ones labour. Is buying shares on the stock market not a labour comparable to someone making minimum wage on 60 hours a week cleaning toilets? Society is contract, not a mass of individual interest.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11.1.3. Con: These individuals often rely on a market of consumers. The UBI would act as an economic stimulant that would benefit them too, in the long run.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11.1.4. Con: Net tax payers still owe society money in exchange for having an educated population that consumes their goods/services.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.3.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11.2. Con: Not being able to afford a decent quality of life, often due to life circumstances not reasonably within your control, is not a dignified way for a human to exist.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.11.3. Con: Spending the majority of your time merely trying to survive in an unfair \(and stressful\) financial situation does not offer many opportunities for freedom.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.12. Pro: The only way to guarantee one person an income is to take from another through coercive force. Government is the only legitimate user of physical force. It should only be used to protect, not to take. To believe it is okay is to not believe in moral absolutes. In other words, anything is okay that one deems so within their conscience based on their subjective views, rather than the objective facts of reality.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.13. Pro: Armed robbery is pretty efficient, too. That doesn't mean it's fair to take the fruits of another's labor. The issue isn't whether it's efficient or not. It's whether it's moral or not.  What Bastiat called "[Legal Plunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_plunder)" is not moral.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.13.1. Con: It could equally be argued that leaving people to suffer and die in poverty is equivalent to a collective societal crime.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.13.1.1. Con: This is not a necessary consequence of forgoing a tax-based welfare program. These kinds of programs interfere in the voluntary non-profit/philanthropic sector, as well as the commercial market sector. There is no telling what altruistic and possibly more effective uses a person would have had for that money had it not been taken away from them via taxation.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.13.1.1.1. Con: The private market and industries cannot be relied on to ensure the provision of basic human rights and reasonable quality of life.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.13.1.2. Con: Rights, responsibilities, and things like crimes can only truly be applied to individuals, not societies. Societies are made up of individuals, but are not the same thing.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.13.1.3. Con: Currently speaking, theft is on the books as a crime, not being charitable isn't a crime. So I'm going to guess that your claim is really something along the lines of "People should be charitable". Which I would agree with that sentiment, but I don't agree that a federal UBI is the way to handle it. Also, forced charity isn't really charity.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.14. Pro: The State is unethical, because it's existance is based on the illegitimate monopoly of coercion, and it's source of income is based on theft \(taxes\), so it shouldn't exist at all. Therefore, UBI shouldn't exist too, because it's execution is dependable on the State's abillity to steal it's citizens \(or collect taxes\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.14.1. Con: Most people prefer living in a stable and orderly society to anarchy where force or coercion may be used by any individual against any individual and individual rights do not exist or are not enforced.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.15. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.13.1.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16. Pro: The only right anybody has in regards to income is the right to keep what they have worked for and legally obtained. A UBI robs people of their labor and gives it to those who haven't earned it.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1. Pro: Life isn't free. Life requires work. A UBI pretends no one has to work, when clearly many have to work and a UBI prevents those who do work from benefitting from their work, since their production will be taken to support the unproductive and irresponsible. A UBI fundamentally reverses the consequences of good and bad choices that promote or inhibit life, which is to forcefully institute an anti-life system under the guise of being life-supporting.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.1. Con: Taking the position of "life requires work" might be seen as pretending that there is a job out there for everyone.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.1.1. Pro: With current levels of technology, it does not take one person's work to feed another. Consider a combine harvester reaping a field. It takes only one person to drive it, and a specialist to maintain it \(who also maintains other machines\). However, this field may produce enough grain to feed hundreds or even thousands. And while other work such as irrigation is also required to reach this output, that work is equally enhanced by technology, such as massive irrigation arrays.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.2. Con: During the great depression, [unemployment peaked at 25%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#United_States) in the U.S. This contributed to the creation of social security, not a "let's deport all these guys to international waters" system. There is truth to "life isn't free", but past behaviors show that it isn't the sole / dominant philosophy by which we include or exclude people from our society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.2.1. Pro: Even in the event of exclusion, we still provide sustenance to imprisoned inmates.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.3. Con: In the hypothetical case of [half the population](http://www.businessinsider.com/over-half-of-jobs-in-the-eu-at-risk-2014-7) or in some cases [two thirds of the population](https://futurism.com/un-report-robots-will-replace-two-thirds-of-all-workers-in-the-developing-world/) being at risk of job loss, a UBI reverses consequences that weren't linked to either good or bad choices. In such a scenario, even many of the productive and responsible would benefit from a safety net.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.4. Pro: The free market is a system where [everyone needs to contribute to society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJr2RO7g7jI) in order to be able to take from society. UBI would allow people to take much more than their fair share.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.4.1. Con: The term "fair share" is an subjective notion that establishes an arbitrary bar for economic participation. It is entirely possible for a person to contribute to a society without engaging in what some might deem an acceptable economic activity because of prejudices.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.4.2. Con: The free market is flawed because nobody can contribute from day one, and people can temporarily lose their ability to contribute through no fault of their own \(and do not deserve to die for this\). There is also the issue of suitably valuing contributions, with prices being easily perverted from the \(nigh-indeterminable\) "true" value of a contribution by any number of factors.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.4.3. Con: The social benefits of a UBI are far higher than its taxation detriment even for the richest. \(e.g. rich people don't live in Congo even though it has low taxes, it is just too dangerous\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.4.4. Con: The free market system is not based on the premise of contributing anything to society.  All one does is buys and sells goods or labor. The invisible hand does the rest.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.4.5. Con: The government already redistributes income through taxes and spending on social programs.  A UBI just makes this redistribution more rational and efficient.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.5. Con: This presumes a constant state of efficiency. Reality has demonstrated that society has become more efficient and this means it is entirely possible to reach an almost null efficiency in regards to human labor versus output.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.1.1.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.6. Con: This makes an assumption that UBI will be set at an enormously high level - a level that would certainly not be practical or feasible given the economic realities and the budgets of state and federal governments.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.6.1. Pro: UBI will most likely be set at levels that allow for the assurance of fresh food, water, electricity, and housing. Done right, UBI can be set at levels low enough.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7. Con: Not if it is financed from sources other than income taxes \(machine tax, carbon tax, value-added tax, financial transactions tax....\)
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1. Pro: Taxes other than income taxes could be raised in order to lessen the economic impact on individuals.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.1. Pro: A UBI wouldn't have to be paid for by taxes. As with other forms of government spending, a UBI could be paid for by fiat spending \(i.e. 'printing money'\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.1.1. Con: Issuing enough currency to fund a UBI would add over four times the yearly increase in total income, causing runaway inflation and requiring even more new currency and new inflation.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: The inflationary constraint upon fiat currency is not some arbitrary number, but instead the real productive capacity of the economy in question. Given the profound levels of current waste and untapped potential, we are nowhere close to maxing out our real productive capacity. The best way to avoid critical inflation from fiat spending is thus to spend it on supporting real productive capacity, rather than upon speculation or rent-seeking \(title-income, interest, etc.\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.1.2. Pro: An economy using a fiat currency is not revenue constrained. The issuer of the currency doesn't need to "get" currency from anyone to spend. Taxes only serve to drive a currency's demand and to draw down currency to prevent inflation. Only currencies pinned to a commodity \(gold\) or fixed exchange rate are dependent upon revenue.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.1.3. Pro: The US dollar is a sovereign fiat currency. Congress creates it by decree with spending and can afford anything for sale in dollars with no structural revenue constraints or the threat of involuntary default on any obligation denominated in dollars. The only constraint on a fiat currency is inflation, not the ability to "fund" anything with taxation. Taxes are not "revenue" for fiat system, as the issuer of currency has no need to "get" currency to spend. Affordability is not on the table.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.1.4. Pro: The US dollar is a sovereign fiat currency that we can never run out of and we can never involuntarily fail to pay any obligation denominated in it. This takes "affordability" off the table.[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i35uBVeNp6c&t=169s) [neweconomicperspectives.org](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/03/where-did-the-federal-reserve-get-all-that-money.html)
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.1.5. Con: Any fiat spending must be balanced against the effects it has on the economy - buying too much of something will cause it's price to increase, for example.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.1.6. Pro: In the future, countries will afford the UBI, as part of a [macro economic process](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/modeling-macroeconomic-effects-ubi/) when unemployment becomes too high and the economy is near collapse and/or major deflation. Modern monetary theory itself can prove this affordability, especially when a country has sovereignty over its' own currency. Please don't forget new currencies and international influence in regards to the UBI that will help other countries afford this, if the need arises. [rooseveltinstitute.org](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/modeling-macroeconomic-effects-ubi/)
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.2. Pro: Respectively lower income taxes for the top 1% and a lowered company tax rate a two areas of taxation that could be amended to ensure a USI, amongst other Universal services, could be adequately funded.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.3. Pro: A special automation tax on profits from the increased productivity of humanless automation can partly cover the cost of UBI.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.4. Pro: UBI through a tax on energy resources and financial transactions makes an increase on the income tax unnecessary, while making society more equal.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.5. Con: The costs of those forms of taxes are all ultimately met by Citizens; even if indirectly.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.6. Pro: If higher tax revenue is required, a [Land Value Tax](https://www.kialo.com/should-a-land-value-tax-be-introduced-to-replace-other-taxes-8742) could be used. Such a tax does not harm the economy and has other localized benefits beyond simply raising revenue.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.8. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.1.1.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.9. Con: UBI does not prevent people who work from benefitting - you're thinking of people on welfare. They will invariably find that by going into work and coming off welfare, they end up with less money than had they done no work at all.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.2. Con: This argument is based on a vision of human nature that is not further elaborated upon. Instead of advocating for a greedy nature, I would plea for a social nature that is core to human being. In the end, people do like to share what they have both with their beloved ones and strangers. A UBI would not kill productivity or rob the laborer, but instead answer to a key feature of human nature.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.3. Con: In nature, only the strongest person has that right — they can take anything from anyone else. Societies exist because of the collective recognition that such a state of anarchy is unjust and unproductive; and so they construct a legal system that protects the vulnerable from random acts of violence. The laws that enable these protections are the only 'rights' that exist.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.3.1. Con: Capitalism is not a zero-sum game. Everybody gets something from an exchange. Even those you would call "weak."
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.3.1.1. Con: Assuming rational actors, both only benefit if the opposite party has no control over what you can put on the negotiating table. This restriction is something we have written into the law, the courts, and the application of that law.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.3.1.1.1. Pro: The fact that exchanges within the system is better for everyone, says nothing about the system as a whole. 
Capitalism removes access to most property from most people by allowing individual ownership of all things. So while two people trading to get what they want, more than what they already have, makes both better off, the property system that dictates the distribution of property makes most people worse off prior to the trade.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.3.1.2. Con: Trades or market transactions, are both not unique to capitalism. Capitalism is the result of our property laws.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.3.2. Con: If society as a whole decides what constitutes a law, then we cannot critique any of the rights it creates — anything that the collective implements is thus tautologically good.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.3.2.1. Con: This is a non sequitur. If there is a Constitutional majority that decides on what is a "right", it becomes one. The original claim was about what was A right, not what was right.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.3.2.2. Con: Society's laws are based on authorities such as divinity, or reason, and through those authorities it can be attacked, but these systems don't argue for unchangeable property rights to support people to the determent of all.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.3.2.3. Con: Society may be persuaded to change its mind. Most societies permit discussing forbidden acts  — at least up to a point.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.3.3. Con: You don't have to construct a "legal system" which upholds "rights" either. At least you don't have to use that language. There can be a group of people who organize a self-defense squad to protect each other and their property.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.4. Con: In almost every UBI proposal, laborers stand to gain the most, and those looking for labor are provided freedom to seek it.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.4.1. Con: This generalizes labor. Some laborers stand to 'lose' \(with higher marginal tax rates\) and some laborers stand to 'win' \(those who are at dead-end jobs to make ends meet\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.4.1.1. Con: Not many people are too concerned about slightly inconveniencing rich people, even if they are working rich people.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.5. Pro: UBI may sound nice in theory, but any political theory which is developed without putting human nature into consideration can never successfully be employed. Given people's inherent selfishness, the better idea is to let people keep what they've earned as much as possible.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.5.1. Con: Human nature includes both competitive and cooperative aspects as outlined by [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory). So while this statement considers the compete nature of humanity it fails to consider the cooperate nature of humanity as well.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.5.2. Con: The notion of "letting people keep what they've earned as much as possible" has led to the macroeconomic situation for which we propose the remedy of UBI in the first place.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.5.3. Con: Progressive taxation for the purpose of redistribution is being employed successfully nearly everywhere in the world.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.5.4. Con: It may not be possible for people to earn much in the first place, even if they put in a lot of effort and time towards such an earning, due to random chance \(like getting hit by a car in winter or cancer\). A UBI helps soften these blows from random chance by providing at least some form of security to the populace.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.5.5. Con: Part of "human nature" is the ability to reason, think rationally and change one's own mind; a capacity for improvement which could be used to accept and embrace a UBI, if indeed one wasn't part of the many who would already welcome and embrace such a thing.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.5.6. Pro: As nature does not guarantee human beings subsistence without labor, a UBI is a violation of natural law and fosters complacency. This leads to social disorder.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.5.6.1. Con: Nature supplies water and food without labor, it isn't a necessity in nature so UBI wouldn't violate any law. Theres no reason to think UBI would lead to social disorder behavior if those peoples life is provided by that same society.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.5.6.2. Con: Humans already employ a wide variety of "unnatural" technologies and techniques in their day to day lives. There is no reason for humans \(or human societies\) to deliberately restrict themselves on the grounds of what is "\(un\)natural".
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.6. Pro: UBI requires redistribution of fairly earned income from those who require "assistance" to those who do not.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.6.1. Con: Not if it is financed from sources other than income taxes \(machine tax, carbon tax, funds from social security programs that would become obsolete, taxes on financial speculation, stimulus packages that are supposed to "trickle down" to the middle class\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.6.2. Con: This statement effectively says that those with income are the ones that need assistance. The fundamental tenet of civil society, and ultimately its purpose, is that we help each other survive. We do that by giving of ourselves when we can to others that need it. Meaning we take from those that can earn income and give it to those who can't. This is either poorly written or idealogically incongruent with the goal of living together.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.7. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.1.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.8. Pro: A UBI, like other welfare programs, involves many taking money from a few. The many have no right to take from the few just because they want it.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.8.1. Con: The few don't have the right to take the amount of money they do from the many, that doesn't stop them.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.8.2. Con: Capitalism is based upon expoitation of workers, as exploitation is the only way that a firm can make a profit \(see Marx\). Under our current laws, the few have the "right" to take from the many, but this is far removed from what is ethical.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.8.3. Con: This assumes 'rights' are god-given, and not enshrined under law \(51% of people\) or Constitution \(67% of people\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.8.4. Con: There are many ethical and philosophical systems which believe the greatest good for the most people should be served as much as possible.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.8.5. Con: 'Just because they want it' is not the principle upon which UBI rests. Rather, it rests on the principle that all economic surplus was created in part with some externalized costs \(unfairly\) borne by the populace as a whole. Thus, some of all wealth earned should be redistributed across the population in order to balance this inequality. UBI is a direct means to do this.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.9. Con: In a world in which labor is replaced by capital \(machine, robots, etc.\) in production processes, an ever greater share of income is generated by machines. These can be taxed heavily without robbing people of their labor.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.10. Con: If 'worked for' is a precondition to income, then inheritances should be outlawed. Earnings from dividends are also called into question, since it's the labor of others utilizing your capital that is creating the surplus - not your own labor. You would have to eliminate these forms of income \(and others\) to use this argument.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.10.1. Pro: Investment and speculation falls into a similar "unearned" category, by this logic.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.10.1.1. Con: Liberal ideology would suggest that investment returns are a result of risk managing.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.11. Con: Workers are robbed of the fruits of their labor each time a profit is earned by a boss.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.11.1. Con: Workers sell their time. By definition, no-one would buy that time, unless they can make a profit, so employment is most commonly a win-win exchange, not a win-lose exchange. This doesn't mean that employment cannot be exploitative, but profit is better understood as one party's share of benefits jointly earned. Even if that share is larger than would be fair, that still falls short of being theft.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.12. Con: Society affords its members certain benefits. Taxes, to a degree, can be considered payment for these favorable circumstances provided to the individual.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.13. Con: "A UBI robs people of their labor and gives it to those who haven't earned it" 
That's capitalism. The current winners are capitalists. Under UBI, the winners will be, on the whole, closer to 'everyone.'
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.14. Pro: If our economic system is inherently unjust, we should work on ways to improve how our economy rewards good behavior and punishes bad behaviour; rather than seeking to force a minimum standard of living in a way that decouples economic reward from productivity.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.14.1. Con: The only way to have control over what our society deems worthy is through state intervention. This would lead to less freedom not more.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.14.1.1. Pro: But if you believe that human freedom is a core ideal, than oneself should be the ultimate decider on what behavior contributes to society. A UBI would provide precisely that freedom to people.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.14.2. Con: Seeking a minimum standard of living for everybody is required to comply with human rights and has nothing to do with economy.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.14.3. Con: Not everyone will agree on what constitutes "good behaviour" and "bad behaviour", and to impose such standards would often lead to violations of freedom.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.15. Con: Suggesting that people are only entitled to what they have worked for only produces a reasonable outcome in a society with no involuntary unemployment.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.13.
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.6. Con: Not helping the poor is immoral. A UBI helps the poor \(and \(thats the point of this discussion\) does it more efficiently and more gracefully so than other welfare schemes\).
1.1.5.2.11.1.25.6.1. Con: There are ways to help the poor without a UBI or welfare scheme, for example free-will charity. The poor are helped, no one is forced to give. Trading one immorality\(not helping the poor\) for another\(UBI\) when a solution exists that is completely moral\(charity\), is immoral in itself.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26. Pro: A UBI, by eliminating the need to work, strongly decrease the incentives that promote innovation.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1. Pro: UBI will negatively impact incentives for technological and economic progress. Be it fame, fortune, or philanthropy, we have all the great things in our life readily available because the brains behind them had something motivating them.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.1. Con: Innovation requires the ability to pursue avenues that might include risk. With no reasonable safety net, these risks may be avoided instead of pursued.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.2. Con: Motivations can be more than money. Warren Buffett is one of the richest people in the world, and still working at an age many people have retired.[g.co](https://g.co/kgs/Cwy8m9)
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.3. Con: Money is not the motivator behind innovation. The great innovators in history were all driven by a will to help people, or by their own passion for their subject.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.3.1. Con: The belief that all innovators in history were not driven by money may be hard to back up. If someone asked people like Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Henry Ford or the Wright Brothers about their drive to go from a neat idea to a scale that could benefit society, money would likely be a leading factor. Useful innovation needs scale and scale requires a lot of work and money. Payoff must be greater than cost for innovation. Here is a good article about driving innovation [sciencedirect.com](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004873331730104X)
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.3.1.1. Con: Thomas Edison claimed credit \(and eventually copyright\) out of greed for work that Nikola Tesla did in order to benefit humanity.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Nicola Tesla did work for the good of mankind, as can be seen in his plans for [universal energy](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/research.science1), something that would be almost impossible to commercialize.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.3.1.1.1.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.4. Con: Much of the greatest technological innovation has been made possible through general research - research that was subsidized through public funds with no direct expectation of profit. The motivator here is not something that a UBI would destroy: human curiosity and the possibility of changing the world.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.4.1. Pro: Those motivations don't magically disappear because we get a little bit of money.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.4.1.1. Pro: Very few people who achieve fame and fortune cease pursuing those goals once they achieve a moderate amount of wealth. This shows that, to an extent at least, incentives to achieve those forms of success go above and beyond just getting rich.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.4.1.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.5. Con: Many mathematicians and scientists of the past were born into wealthy and affluent positions affording them the freedom to peruse their true interests benefiting society and not what keeps bread on their table.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.6.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.7. Pro: UBI reduces incentives for creating new products and advancing our civilization. Many good inventions and products were driven by the desire to become wealthy, if much of that wealth was taken away and redistributed to people not working, many would not try as hard to make more money.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.7.1. Con: Wealth will still be possible to accrue \(and thus still a motivation\), as income beyond your UBI can still be attained through work or the sale of goods, ideas, and services.
1.1.5.2.11.1.26.1.8. Con: [The idea that money is a motivator is untrue,](https://youtu.be/dgKKPQiRRag) and studies have proven that money only motivates up until a living wage, after which competence is a greater motivator.
1.1.5.2.11.2. Con: A UBI will help facilitate the starting of businesses by people who are already motivated for their own reasons but lack the means.
1.1.5.2.12. Con: A UBI would reduce the incentives for starting a business by \(potentially\) taxing business owners to the point that becoming a business owner would no longer be worth the risks.
1.1.5.2.13. Con: A UBI by definition is enough to cover the total cost of all the essential resources that an average human adult consumes in one year. Therefore, UBI could not allow for a person to pursue an education or start a business. If it did, it would be providing more than the essential resources that an average human adult consumes in one year.
1.1.5.2.13.1. Con: Under a UBI existential stress is lowered and free time is increased, giving the person time to complete their studies using free resources such as the library and the internet.
1.1.5.2.13.1.1. Con: While a self-educated individual can be incredibly intelligent. An education not obtained through an accredited institution such as a college or university has little impact on the person's hirability. A freely obtained education therefore might distract a criminal personality, for a time. However because it ultimately won't change the situation for most people, it will most likely not prevent much crime, and might produce smarter and thus more dangerous criminals.
1.1.5.2.13.1.1.1. Con: Under a UBI being hired to a job is not a requirement for survival.
1.1.5.2.13.1.1.1.1. Con: This is circular reasoning, the above claim was in response to a UBI providing the ability for people to get an education, the idea being that an education improves a person's ability to rise above and no longer need the UBI. If it's just about a person becoming educated with no intention of applying that education in the economic system, then the fact that person gets an education has no bearing on the discussion at hand.
1.1.5.2.13.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Economic attainment is not the only worthwhile pursuit in life.
1.1.5.2.13.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The state shouldn't fund non-economic pursuits.
1.1.5.2.13.2. Con: Under current welfare programs, it is not possible to accumulate any extra wealth as any and all liquid wealth is seen as a signal the claimant does not need assistance and thus benefits are reduced. Under a UBI if you are smart about your finances, you can accumulate money as there is no means testing which means there is no cap on how much you can accumulate. If you can live frugally, you could accumulate a large amount of money and thus start a business.
1.1.5.2.13.2.1. Pro: This is really an important point. There are other claims that state people would work less \(less incentive\) with a UBI in place, but really, with other welfare programs that are gone if you work and earn something additionally, those are more discouraging people to work.
1.1.5.2.13.2.2. Con: As the parent claim states, "By definition a UBI is enough to cover the total cost of all essential resources". If there was anything left over to save, then you're being paid more than the total cost of all essential resources. If you're capable of accumulating anything the UBI is too much.
1.1.5.2.13.3. Con: Starting a business would still require savings for the initial investment. The UBI would just be a safety net, and cover personal expenses while the business is not yet making money.
1.1.5.2.13.3.1. Con: In order to get those initial savings, a person would have to be above the UBI level. Therefore, that person is then taking a risk by starting a business, if the risk pays off that person could become very wealthy, if it doesn't they may end up with nothing. Society shouldn't be responsible for funding people's risk taking behavior, even moreso if they don't get to share in the rewards. If they want to take a risk, they should take the responsibility too.
1.1.5.2.14. Con: Extending government grant and support schemes would better support new businesses, and also cost less.
1.1.5.2.14.1. Pro: For the same cost of a UBI, much more support to new businesses could be provided through targeted government grants and loans. The money saved from not paying 'wasted' UBI to the wealthy could go into initial grants for new small businesses, to get them off the ground.
1.1.5.2.14.2. Pro: Government support would be time bounded, which would give the necessary drive for businesses to work hard or fail. A UBI could indefinitely prop up businesses which may have no productive future.
1.1.5.2.14.3. Pro: Support could be conditional on a good business plan. This helps make sure that people are working on a business with actual potential, which would reduce stress and the [high chance of failure](https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail).
1.1.5.3. Con: Crime is an economic opportunity, as well as a social opportunity. The UBI isn't even remotely considerable enough to engage in either of the stated opportunities listed.
1.1.5.3.1. Con: It does, however, create an alternative option and opportunity - it may not be enough on its own, but would be a factor in tilting the scales away from crime and making it seem less necessary or appealing, the risks less proportionate to the rewards.
1.1.5.4. Pro: A UBI could prevent government entities \(like counties or states\) from [turning to illegal or crime-encouraging activities out of desperation to repair their insubstantial economy, such as marijuana and gambling \(i.e. casinos\)](http://www.newsweek.com/unexpected-side-effects-legalizing-weed-339931).
1.1.5.5. Con: Not all crime stems from a lack of economic opportunities, for example white collar crime.
1.1.5.6. Con: Crime is always a personal decision. Blaming lack of economic opportunity disposes with personal responsibility for one's own actions.
1.1.5.7. Con: In wealthy countries, like the U.S., there are always economic opportunities. They may be hard to take advantage of, but not impossible. See any rags to riches success story for anecdotal evidence. Which is sufficient for this point, if it's possible, even for one person to actually accomplish, then it's possible for others to follow in their footsteps and duplicate their results.
1.1.5.8. Con: Not all poor people are criminals, thus it must be possible to be poor and not turn to crime. In fact, most poor people aren't criminals.
1.1.5.9. Con: There are criminals that aren't poor, many that are already super rich.
1.1.5.10. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.13.
1.1.6. Pro: If a UBI replaced benefits that have restrictive limiting criteria, then it would reduce crime caused by benefit fraud as you would not need to notify changes of circumstances as extensively. For example, [this would not have happened](http://www.tenby-today.co.uk/article.cfm?id=112354&headline=Suspended%20sentence%20for%20benefit%20fraud&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2017).
1.1.7. Pro: A study by [Akee et. al \(2010\)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.2.1.86) shows that a government cash transfer might significantly increase education for children coming from poor backgrounds as well as decreasing the probability of minor criminal offences.
1.1.7.1. Con: A cash transfer reducing future criminal offenses is unrelated to UBI. If a complex welfare system different from UBI injected more money into poor background children education than UBI, this argument would be against UBI.
1.1.8. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.
1.1.9. Con: A UBI forces hard working people to give money to the least-deserving individuals that they try not to give to normally, like [criminals, especially hard ones](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/business/stockton-basic-income.html) \(evidenced by being rejected from jobs they apply to\). Since people are still rewarded after committing a crime with a UBI, people will feel less consequences in committing crimes, which can drive crime up.
1.1.9.1. Pro: This is especially true with UBI experiments, because the [unemployed criminals](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/business/stockton-basic-income.html) most likely will get first benefits from a UBI. Criminals will get a greater benefit from a UBI than hard-working individuals, at least in the beginning of the process.
1.1.9.1.1. Con: Criminals would receive the same amount as everyone else. Universal basic income isn't given in different amounts or at different times.
1.1.9.1.2. Con: This focuses more on not helping criminals, universal health care is allowed to criminals too.
1.1.9.1.3. Pro: This is especially true with UBI experiments, because the unemployed criminals most likely will get first benefits from a UBI, due to trials. In trials, entities need to be selective, so they pick the strongest candidates possible, which is more likely to be criminals than an workers. Thus, they get picked and attain benefits before anyone else.
1.1.9.2. Con: UBI programs could be designed exclude criminals \(especially while in or at least a year after getting out of prison\).
1.1.9.3. Con: This might be the case if UBI is considered a reward but that isn't what it is. To assume that UBI has an impact on consequence for crimes is also quite a stretch.
1.1.9.4. Con: A UBI would be no greater reward to criminals than different welfare systems already are. Besides, this "reward" seems irrelevant compared to the punishment of being in prison.
1.1.9.5. Con: You will be hard pressed to find a better option to deal with criminality than to give them a baseline, not giving them anything will drastically increase their chance of repeated crime.
1.1.9.6. Con: When a person has served their time in jail, it is best for the nation to accept them as complete citizens again. In this way they are able to break free from any elements which lead them to criminal actions. Economic opportunity is a large element of recidivism, and adding barriers to re-entry to society only perpetuates that cycle. This includes being denied jobs for previous offenses \(barring crimes of trust for positions of trust\)
1.1.10. Con: Criminals would be more likely to get away with the crimes they commit.
1.1.10.1. Pro: If given money through a UBI, criminals will have more power in getting out of their punishment \(like being able to pay for [bail more easily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS5mwymTIJU)\).
1.1.10.1.1. Con: Being able to pay bail does not mean they get away with a crime. This could only be the case if UBI is not taken into account when bail is determined.
1.1.10.2. Con: The opposite might happen where if funds are diverted away from the justice system to pay for a UBI; then more people could be convicted of crimes they did not commit due to a lack of a proper defense \(such as from a [lack of properly-funded public defenders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USkEzLuzmZ4) to help them\).
1.1.11. Pro: A society’s progress is both measured financially and morally. The poorer the society the higher the crime and moral decay rate. UBI could indeed help societies to address low-income citizens’ sense of helplessness thus providing them with hope and life meaning. UBI would also provide these people with some basic financial means, which will help them leave a decent and more secure life.
1.1.12. Pro: UBI reduces stress which leads to less mental illness and the crimes associated with mental illness.
1.1.12.1. Pro: Unresolved, compounded [stress](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/stress/index.shtml) can lead to mental disorders like depression and anxiety. With money being a [major stressor](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/02/money-stress.aspx) of 64% of Americans-particularly in the lower income bracket-a UBI can decrease this stress by increasing the amount of money contributed to a household.
1.1.12.2. Pro: [Financial stress](http://www.acseduonline.com/blog-stress-causes-crime-95.aspx) can cause crime when there is a lack of qualifications and social support for at-risk individuals. A UBI provides extra financial support that may relieve this stress.
1.1.12.3. Con: Implementing a UBI would require massive increases in taxation on the middle class, resulting in greater stress for a large swath of the population.
1.1.12.3.1. Pro: A UBI requires higher tax rates that harm the economy.
1.1.12.3.1.1. Con: The bulk of tax increases could be levied upon the super-wealthy. In the US in particular this would only marginally shift that top tax rate [back to its historic norm of 50%+](http://www.ctj.org/pdf/regcg.pdf) which did not seem to overly constrain growth between 1917 and 1987.
1.1.12.3.1.1.1. Pro: There already are initiatives founded by [millionaires](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/21/40-millionaires-ask-new-york-raise-taxes-wealthy-1-percent-plan-fairness) to raise the tax for the rich. This shows their willingness to contribute more to society.
1.1.12.3.1.1.1.1. Con: There several offshore tax schemes - such as those discovered by the [Panama Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers) - that prove wealthy individuals are willing to try to hide their assets to contribute less.
1.1.12.3.1.1.2. Con: As the very richest are able to [shape tax policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/business/economy/for-the-wealthiest-private-tax-system-saves-them-billions.html?_r=0), it is unlikely they would accept extensive tax increases.
1.1.12.3.1.1.2.1. Con: That doesn't mean that it can't happen in a democracy.
1.1.12.3.1.1.3. Pro: A UBI would have a much greater positive impact on the economy that tax cuts, as giving $1 to those with lower incomes has three times the growth effects on GDP as compared to giving the same $1 to high income individuals, due to the economic multiplier effect. [huffingtonpost.com](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-santens/the-economist-just-came-o_b_7447312.html)
1.1.12.3.1.1.4. Pro: There would be enough wealth if it were to be distributed down from [billionaires](http://time.com/money/5112462/billionaires-made-so-much-money-last-year-they-could-end-extreme-poverty-seven-times/). No one needs that much money \([apparently](https://qz.com/1211957/how-much-money-do-people-need-to-be-happy/) money doesnt increase happiness after $105,000 per year\). \(There should be a cut off point; if you make more than 500,000 a year \(and slowly decrease it to 105,000 to reduce shock\), you only keep 200,000, the rest goes to the government, who can make much better use of it.\)
1.1.12.3.1.1.4.1. Con: There would be difficulties implementing this, as many wealthy people would feel robbed of the fruits of "their" hard work, ignoring or overlooking the advantages of their privilege.
1.1.12.3.1.2. Pro: In the short run, tax increases have a negative impact on demand. As households and companies have less available income and capital due to higher taxes, they will spend and invest less.
1.1.12.3.1.2.1. Con: A UBI as additional form of income mitigates this negative effect, especially for those with lower incomes.
1.1.12.3.1.2.2. Con: However they will have paid a fair tax rate that benefits all citizens. Instead of low taxes lining the pockets of investors and private companies delivering the universal services a government should provide its people.
1.1.12.3.1.3. Pro: In the long run [high marginal tax rates](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-do-taxes-affect-economy-long-run) have a negative impact on the supply by discouraging work, saving, investment, and innovation.
1.1.12.3.1.4. Pro: A UBI will increase taxes for those making money, thus pushing capital-makers to move elsewhere, and making the UBI financially unsustainable
1.1.12.3.1.4.1. Pro: If the scheme is national/regional only, and that net cost to some is too high, they may take their financial and/or other resources elsewhere. Would the benefits of living and doing business in a UBI society outweigh the higher costs in tax?
1.1.12.3.1.5. Con: Tax rates will not increase in an economy-hurting way, as simultaneously other taxed-based welfare programs can be reduced.
1.1.12.3.1.5.1. Con: The marginal incentive not to work for lower income workers, coupled with the need to find more tax revenue, results in a clear need to raise taxation. To replace grants for the poor with an income for everyone implies that cutting old social spending projects will be insufficient.
1.1.12.3.1.5.1.1. Con: A marginal incentive not to work does not equal not working. This could even make working hours more efficient due to increased drive of efficiency in the marketplace.
1.1.12.3.1.5.2. Con: Reduced spending on things like food stamps reduces effective income. This reduces the effective gains of a UBI.
1.1.12.3.1.6. Pro: Increased taxation and reduced spending on targeted welfare will result in increased pressure on the incomes of the poor.
1.1.12.3.1.6.1. Con: A UBI is inherently additive to the incomes of the poor, as long as they are working and the minimum wage is kept to inflation, they have increased income from a UBI.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2. Con: With a progressive taxation system that redistributes wealth, individuals with a low socio-economic status would likely receive more than they put in.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1. Con: A UBI would take money away from the rich, which would greatly decrease job creation and economic growth.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: With a decrease in overall wealth comes a decrease in overall jobs because the wealthy employ everyone! It's a slippery slope that we're better off not starting down.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: But this [hurts the rich](http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=25285). Which, in turn, destroys jobs and creates more poor people.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.2.1. Con: This is the problem with any redistribution scheme: the rich can't be hurt because they control the prices and the jobs.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.2.2. Pro: The rich can't be hurt; they control the prices and jobs available in their industry.  This can reduce jobs once they start compensating for the economic shift, however.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.2.2.1. Con: Powerful industries can be hurt. For example, this occurs through the effectiveness of anti-trust laws when they were properly enforced.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Boycotts of a sufficiently large scale can also hurt a company or industry, as can strikes and industrial action.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.2.3. Con: Middle class people, not the rich, are more likely to create the small businesses that generate new jobs.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.2.4. Pro: If these rich backers of UBI are so enthuastic, they should use their own money to demonstrate proof of concept.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.2.5. Con: The rich can only benefit from a wealthier middle and working class. With more money being spent businesses will have higher profits in turn giving the rich more money.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.3. Con: A UBI may decrease job creation and even decrease the number of existing jobs. But it will not decrease economic growth: it will stimulate the development of automation as low paying jobs disappear. If anything, the rich who invest in automation will stand to profit heavily from this development.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.3.1. Con: More people replacing their entire income with UBI would create a large amount of "stagnant" capital that never got invested or put toward anything. Some individuals may do well entrepeneurially when they couldn't before - but it is unproven that this is the majority case.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.3.1.1. Con: if people are living off capital, it is not stagnated, it is being used, capital only stagnates when it is saved.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4. Pro: Income inequality is not inherently bad because it provides good economic incentives. The promise that you can make it to the top if you work hard makes it more likely that people advance their economic position.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.1. Con: These are the twin myths of meritocracy and trickle down economics, neither of which have ever been proven in a real world setting.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.2. Con: Rich people save a higher amount of their income relative to poor people. If you want to show that trickle down economics work, you need to show how burying money would stimulate the economy.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.3. Con: The average person should ask if the reason they are not rich is due to a lack of trying, and evaluate the above claim based on their conclusion.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.3.1. Pro: The old adage of "it's not what you know, it's who you know" often proves true; growing up and/or living in wealthy circles makes one more likely to receive opportunities for further wealth.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.3.2. Pro: Investment is easier when one has greater access to starting capital and/or loans.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.3.3. Pro: People who are already among the wealthy \(or who belong to families which are\) have access to information and strategies which are not commonly taught or provided to the lower classes. Even if they can eventually gain access to this information \(through courses, etc.\), it is not a routine part of their formative years and education.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.4. Con: This argument asks us to ignore the sloth, and underhandedness characteristic of many, if not all, members of the upper class.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.5. Con: This asks people who know that they work hard long hours to accept that the only reason they are still in poverty is that they aren't working hard enough. Anyone who does not see the problem here is encouraged to go out, and try doing this directly.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.6. Con: If that were true, we would have miners and road workers as presidents.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.7. Con: If this promise is a false promise, as there is reason to believe, it effectively amounts to deception at best and slavery by deception at worst.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.8. Con: Income inequality is an inherently bad thing, as it leads to stress, relationship breakdown and crime amongst other things.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.9. Con: The [great gatsby curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Gatsby_curve) shows that the greater inequality is, the lower social mobility is - so that even though there might be greater incentives, its actually much harder to get to them.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.10. Con: People like all animals do not need to "better themselves". We need to have needs met such as food, water, community, etc.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5. Pro: It doesn't help the economy to reward low-paid jobs, but [higher paid jobs](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/17/opinion/the-reagan-boom-greatest-ever.html). Higher paid jobs require ambition, motivation, and hard work. It's only worth it if there are incentives to do it.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.1. Con: Trickle down economics don't work. We've tried them before, and come up with nothing. Even in theory, the richer you are, the higher a proportion of your income you save. Insisting they work at this point is nothing but a bold faced lie.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.2. Con: Higher paying jobs still reward people more then lower paying ones.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.3. Con: Motivations are worthless if you don't have the ability to act on them. You can't start a business without an office you can't afford; you can't work hours of manual labor if you are starving; you can't get a job as a teacher if you can't afford to learn the knowledge you wish to impart.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.3.1. Con: Although opportunity is not perfectly equal, a degree of equality is offered through the [ability to receive investment/loans](https://www.inc.com/guides/2010/07/how-to-finance-your-business.html). Even if someone is very poor, if they have a very good business idea, they will likely be able to receive some startup money.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.3.1.1. Con: It seems like every head of a successful business has a story about how they were poor, and destitute, and someone gave them a shot. But these businesses are far from the total of the story as most people, even with great ideas, don't get those loans and their stories are buried by survival bias.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.4. Con: Higher paid jobs are not the result of some 'virtue' poor people lack, but opportunities they were given and poor people weren't — like an education or an inheritance.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.4.1. Pro: Some jobs are also undervalued because they don't produce physical products, such as education and childcare.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.4.2. Pro: Members of wealthy families often have the opportunity to gather capital very easily in order to found a business or make investments.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.3.1.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.3.2.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.3.3.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.5. Con: This argument mirrors almost perfectly the [gospel of property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology), [which tells people with cancer should seek treatment by giving money to a rich person who merely talks about how rich he is, instead of seeking the medical attention they need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1xJAVZxXg). Both put people with wealth on a pedestal, and lie to the poor and desperate that if they just give to these 'purer' people \(in this case, by working for them\) they can be better and more successful people.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.5.1. Con: This misses the point of the grandparent, which partially emphasizes that higher-paying jobs tend to be more valuable to + lacked by society, since the price signals of the market \(as established in economics 101\) indicate what society wants more or less of.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.7. Con: Money does not measure the worth of a person, their contribution to the society does. An individual's monetary worth measures only their talent in amassing a resource and is a solitary act benefiting only one individual. An act that in turn deprives others of access to that  resource and impedes contribution by the many to society. If money is the only measure of personal worth, then one's life is a meaningless pursuit of coin and paper that ceases to have value upon one's death.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6. Pro: UBI inadvertently makes the economy less efficient as it takes money from those who would otherwise invest and save that money and who have the most efficient network and resources with which to invest that money. It entrusts those who could not otherwise procure that money, to save or invest it in a way that adds value to the economy.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.1. Con: There's a break-even point where the contentment of the people is necessary to keep a stable market. Automation is coming so labor demand will slowly evaporate. In that light it's not always less efficient.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.2. Pro: Buying more consumer items such as TVs, sports tickets, etc \(the most likely use\) doesn't create value — investing does.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.2.1. Con: Under driving capitalist theory, consumption actually does create value: [the people spending that money value the items they are consuming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_voting), so those companies get the money to grow, since they make valuable products.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.3. Con: Saving does not grow the economy. The money sits there in the bank not being used, maybe, just maybe, some of it is loaded out to pay for an investment, but for the most part it just sits there, doing nothing.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.3.1. Pro: [Seventy percent](http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/01/news/economy/american-consumer-saving-not-spending/index.html) of economic activity comes from American consumers. With more people saving money, less money is in external circulation resulting in a slow-growing economy.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.3.2. Con: The saved funds are not simply put under the mattress but become reinvested in order to achieve a profitable return. Therefore, the saved proportion is available as loanable funds adding fresh capital stocks to the markets and as a result, increase the markets' [productive capacity](https://mnmeconomics.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/why-the-saving-rate-is-important/).
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.3.2.1. Con: Reinvestment is not as good for the economy as actually spending money is. An estimate of [the consumption multiplier is somewhere above 1.36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_multiplier#United_States_of_America), while [the savings multiplier, even if we assume the highest interest rate on a savings account is undervalued by a factor of 20, is 1.26.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/01/pf/savings-account-yields/index.html)
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.3.2.2. Pro: Money in savings accounts is used by banks as collateral in their loaning and investment activities. In this way it doesn't 'sit there' but rather enables other productive uses.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.3.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.3.2.1.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.3.3. Pro: This would be true only if savings were stored in a vault or under the bed, but this is false if savings are in the bank. If banks did not benefit in any way from savings accounts, they would have already discontinued this service. Savings accounts in banks do indeed grow the economy.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.3.2.1.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.4. Con: Investing in new ventures is good and all, but if consumers can't afford to buy your product, it's not going to grow the economy.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.7. Pro: The rich employ everyone else. So rewarding higher-paying jobs is, actually, much better for the economy.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.7.1. Con: Rich people do not employ everybody, or even most people: ["Small firms accounted for 64 percent of  the net new jobs created between 1993  and 2011 \(or 11.8 million of the 18.5  million net new jobs\). Since the latest  recession, from mid-2009 to 2011, small  firms, led by the larger ones in the cat - egory \(20-499 employees\), accounted for  67 percent of the net new jobs."](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/FAQ_Sept_2012.pdf)
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.7.1.1. Pro: Businessmen \(or entrepreneurs\) of all types employ everybody. Big businesses have more jobs, there just aren't as many of them.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.7.1.2. Con: A UBI would destroy small businesses, because it would take people out of the workforce and require these businesses to pay higher taxes and fees.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.7.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.7.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.4.1.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.7.2. Con: In the current age of information technology, a very small amount of people can gather a huge amount of money without any need to significantly increase the employee base of a company. Any major website company is a perfect example of that.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.8. Con: Automation will greatly decrease job creation anyway. The rich will invest in automation, not new jobs.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.9. Pro: A UBI would require the government to collect a huge amount of taxes. Since, depending on how much the UBI is going to pay, has to be payed by the richer half of the working population, that would likely be diminished through emigration, experiencing a high utility loss.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.10. Con: Job creation is driven by demand of goods and services, not the amount of wealth the rich have. UBI would increase such demand, and so creates jobs.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.10.1. Con: Only the "rich" have the capital to start such enterprises as to produce these new products and services you are suggesting. Starting business isn't a cheap thing, you need tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars of liquid capital for a bank to even consider giving you a loan to help you get started.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.11. Pro: Forcible income redistribution from those who produce wealth to those who do not leads to a less optimal allocation of wealth for the purposes of growing the economy, and economic growth has many positive externalities that make it the primary vehicle for raising the standard of living.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.12. Pro: The harm done to the poor as a result of the economic growth lost to the higher tax burden would outweigh the benefits the poor would derive from higher welfare benefits, because the former is compounding while the latter is not.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.13. Con: This depends on the taxation scheme in operation, in a progressive taxation system the effective rate of taxation can be closely mirrored by a UBI system for all incomes above a certain point. [These graphs](https://codepen.io/adamdharrington/full/GdpMyG/) reflect Ireland's tax system and can be adjusted to different UBI levels and tax rates.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.14. Con: Since job growth resides in implementing good ideas \(like inventions\) that make money, placing money into the hands of more people, allow more ideas to grow and thus stimulate the job creation/economic growth. Monopolies/oligopolies \(with their copyrights\) tend to stymie the economy rather than grow it.
1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.14.1. Con: If copyright laws are in effect, the masses cannot implement anything they create anyway. That makes the economy not able to grow, even when money is placed in the hands of inventors. In the end, the rich still get richer.
1.1.12.3.1.7. Pro: The reduced incentive to work for those who are guaranteed an income will reduce government tax revenue.
1.1.12.3.1.7.1. Con: Income taxation is not the only source of government revenue. Money is also made from exports, property taxes, the sale of bonds, and government investments.
1.1.12.3.1.7.2. Con: Simultaneously, the revenue from sales taxes is likely to increase as a UBI provides a secure source of income for citizens that can be used for consumption purposes.
1.1.12.3.1.7.3. Con: Most people do not work to accomplish a standard of living that consists of basic subsistence. The overall incentives to work do not change because of a UBI.
1.1.12.3.1.8. Con: The IMF recently released a report which claims that higher tax would not negatively affect growth [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/11/imf-higher-taxes-rich-inequality-jeremy-corbyn-labour-donald-trump)
1.1.12.3.1.8.1. Pro: Misinformation by government that lower taxes are beneficial to society and the citizenry is a fallacy perpetrated to ensure votes at the ballot box.
1.1.12.3.1.9. Pro: Any democratic country that implemented a UBI would be forced to raise taxes on its citizens. Governments do not produce money, they only have the money that is taxed from the citizenry. Therefore, in order to come up with the money to pay for the UBI, taxes would have to be raised.
1.1.12.3.1.9.1. Pro: A UBI is fiscally unsustainable due to the government's expenses. Either, we'll have to universally increase taxes \(which would be impossible, because lots of countries already have incredibly high tax rates \[Belgium, Sweden,...\]\), or countries will have to cut costs in certain departments, which would not be a very popular decision.
1.1.12.3.1.9.2. Pro: Discussing a UBI as a benefit to a population without  acknowledging that it creates an equal obligation to that same population is not intellectually honest. If one is born with a right to UBI then one would also be born with an equal obligation to pay for it. It's another not-so-clever scheme for income redistribution. If a UBI was renamed "Selective Additional Tax" for some citizens, it would not be such a popular topic.
1.1.12.3.1.9.2.1. Con: The obligation that comes with UBI is like that of defending the nation \(the draft\) and upholding the law \(jury summons\). Normally these would be a violation of individual liberty but they are not because they are required to maintain the nation and the nation is required to maintain social spending. Citizens subject themselves to the possibility of obligatory service in exchange for receiving entitlement spending.
1.1.12.3.1.9.2.1.1. Con: A nation needs protection and borders to prevent, or at least deter, external attacks. Nations do not need a UBI.
1.1.12.3.1.9.2.1.1.1. Con: A UBI specifically might not be necessary but it seems most nations consider social safety nets are as essential as defense. For example, the U.S. spends [more on entitlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#/media/File:CBO_Infographic_2016.png) than the military. That safety net could be UBI or something else, but for the sake of this debate we are assuming social spending is necessary.
1.1.12.3.1.10. Con: With the introduction and proliferation of automation and AI into the production systems, higher income tax rates for businesses would mostly affect activities which are not performed by humans. This would not have a negative impact in the economy.
1.1.12.3.1.10.1. Con: Without humans being a source of production, there is little incentive for governments to support humans over simply putting the money back into AI and other productive sources.
1.1.12.3.1.11. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.
1.1.12.3.1.12. Pro: UBI would create a vicious circle: As the after-tax income of more and more economic activities falls below UBI, taxes on the remaining workers must rise, marginalising the next layer of workers. The number of dropouts from the production system will rise until final economic breakdown and total poverty everywhere.
1.1.12.3.1.13. Con: Tax is largely raised when money moves from one individual to another. This regular cash injection will boost the economy and provide more tax back as a result, limiting the need for higher tax.
1.1.12.3.1.14. Pro: It's not per se that meeting poverty is too expensive, but that to perpetually prevent poverty would be an ever increasing cost \(poverty can't be eliminated once and for all\).
1.1.12.3.1.14.1. Con: If the UBI rate was explicitly targeting poverty it could easily switch to using an absolute, rather than relative, definition of poverty to account for the distortions in income a UBI would provide.
1.1.12.3.1.14.2. Con: This would not be true if UBI was funded by taxation and redistribution. Taxation does not inherently cause inflation.
1.1.12.3.1.14.3. Pro: UBI simply moves the poverty line to a higher income, because poverty in a country is usually measured at 60% of median income. Adding x-amount of money to all income simply increases poverty treshold. The 60% idea is based on the principles of social inclusion, and the idea that producers market towards median income to maximise sales.
1.1.12.3.1.14.3.1. Con: Objective standards of living, however, can be improved.
1.1.12.3.1.14.4. Con: This depends on the definition of poverty used. A UBI may be used to ensure an acceptable standard of living for all members of the community in a country.
1.1.12.3.1.15. Con: Taxes will be more happily paid since UBI contributes to the well-being of everyone in society. This will reduce the incentive for people to avoid or evade tax. This additional tax income will reduce the necessity for tax increases. UBI allows the liberty for people to spend it as wishes; quite different nowadays you pay and the Government decides what to invest it in.
1.1.12.3.1.15.1. Pro: It removes the paternalistic role of Government to say how taxes should be invested since everyone would spend their UBI in what they prefer. Given that a certain percentage of taxes still would go to public services enjoyed by everybody.
1.1.12.3.1.15.2. Pro: It would lower [tax resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_resistance).
1.1.12.3.1.15.3. Con: The more "money productive" people would be at a loss and discouraged to be as useful as s/he was to exchange valuable work with other people. It would increase tax resistance in some groups.
1.1.12.3.1.16. Con: By allowing people to live healthier lives, there will be major cost savings in the healthcare sector, which is publicly funded in many developed countries.
1.1.12.3.1.16.1. Con: Even if the population is healthier, the cost of general care \(regular check-ups, vaccinations, maternity, etc.\), emergency care \(traffic accidents\) and [elderly care](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/01/ageing-britain-two-fifths-nhs-budget-spent-over-65s) will still be very high and may be crippled by a UBI. To avoid that, an increase in taxes may still be necessary.
1.1.12.3.2. Con: There are alternative sources of financing, such as public dividends, that may be used to sustain UBI without creating extra pressure on the layperson's economics.
1.1.12.3.3. Con: The tax effects on people who are already well-off and stable would not be as significant as the benefits to people whose quality of life and/or prospects would be significantly improved by a UBI.
1.1.12.4. Pro: Stress has been affecting the lives of those living in the cities [so much](https://www.stress.org/daily-life/), mainly work, money and the future, that it is literally [changing the pathways in our brains](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10190) and there is [data proof](http://www.gwern.net/docs/nature/2010-peen.pdf) that living in the cities or urban areas in general has a direct impact on our mental health and how prone we are to disorders, in developed countries.
1.1.12.4.1. Pro: That is [debilitating to society](http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2004-15935-004) as a whole, no matter who you are as [stress is infectious in and of itself](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/stress-cues-from-others#2) AND can make you more [susceptible to other diseases](https://www.clinicaleducation.org/resources/reviews/chronic-stress-increases-infection-susceptibility/).
1.1.13. Con: Many crimes do not occur due to economic problems. For instance many crimes stem from issues with [drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug-related_crime), [mental illness](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854807312851), or [relationships](http://law.jrank.org/pages/1177/Family-Relationships-Crime-General-socialization-crime.html).
1.1.13.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.1.13.2. Con: There is a [positive relationship](https://borgenproject.org/addiction-poverty-connected/) between poverty and substance \(drugs\) abuse.
1.1.13.2.1. Con: Positive relationship aka correlation doesn't imply causation. The second sentence in the linked above article states: " The direction of causation is unclear". The strongest claim that article makes is that poverty cause drug abuse is: "...and perhaps even some causal effect." Also it completely ignores that the can be no casual effect in any directions i.e. that there is other hidden factor\(s\) that has casual relation to both poverty and drug abuse.
1.1.13.3. Pro: UBI is most pressing to individuals below the poverty line. Some of these individuals are below the poverty line because of addictions. The UBI would enable addictive behavior.
1.1.13.3.1. Con: This suggests that not giving them this benefit would stop them from being addicted. There is no reason to believe this.
1.1.13.3.2. Con: Staying off of addictive substances is a real struggle, and one needs the means to be able to do it.
1.1.13.3.3. Con: Some people in poverty may have addictions, but not all. There are many other causes of, and contributors to, poverty.
1.1.13.3.4. Con: It may be worth inadvertently enabling some addictive behaviour in order to deliver the other benefits of the UBI, such as assisting those in poverty for other reasons.
1.1.13.3.5. Pro: UBI would provide addictive, impulsive personalities with an endless source of income - enslaving them to impulsivity and rendering change impossible for many.
1.1.13.3.5.1. Con: If someone could not change with the advantages offered by a UBI, it's unlikely they would change while suffering the disadvantages of living in poverty.
1.1.13.4. Con: A UBI could also give people with drug addictions or mental illness the ability to pay for assistance with the issue.
1.1.13.5. Con: -> See 1.1.12.
1.1.14. Con: Most major economic crimes are motivated by a greed for acquiring wealth above a subsistence level. A UBI is unlikely to decrease this drive.
1.1.14.1. Pro: Four of the five most committed crimes in the US are [property crimes](http://www.criminaljusticedegreehub.com/what-are-the-most-common-crimes-in-the-united-states/), despite the existence of existing social safety nets.
1.1.14.1.1. Con: This could equally be evidence that existing social safety nets are significantly insufficient.
1.1.14.1.2. Con: The US social safety net is [one of the lowest in the world](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SAFETYNETSANDTRANSFERS/Resources/281945-1124119303499/SSNPrimerNote25.pdf).
1.1.14.1.3. Con: The type of crime committed in the US has no bearing on this discussion unless you can provide a link between that type of crime and receipt of benefits
1.1.14.2. Pro: In Queensland, Australia, 81% of criminals charged with property crimes [said they did so to support a drug habit](http://www.aic.gov.au/crime_types/property%20crime/drugs.html).
1.1.14.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.13.2.
1.1.14.3. Pro: Organised crime groups attempt to get rich from crime; not merely subsist. Internationally their acts [are worth $870 billion USD a year](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/16/organised-crime-worth-560bn).
1.1.14.4. Con: Petty crimes can be more dangerous to individuals' health and feelings of safety, however. Such  crimes would be more intuitive to desperate individuals: a knife-point mugging is more likely to occur to them than major fraud.
1.1.14.5. Con: Even if true, a lack of reduction in economic crime does not mean the UBI is not effective in reducing other types of crime, namely the ones committed to acquire basic sustenance.
1.1.15. Pro: A UBI serves as an economic cushion and a de-stress factor, by providing society with alternatives to the most common problems found in current society with the financial safety it provides. That means less stress cycling through from person to person during interactions, which also betters behavior as there will be less stressed people to interact with.
1.1.16. Con: Rising poverty causes more crime. With an UBI, the economy will enter a vicious  circle where more and more workers will continually drop out of the productive sector as post-tax post-inflation incremental income from working continually falls. The nominal UBI will buy less and less real produced goods, poverty will rise, and crime will reach unprecendented levels.
1.1.17. Con: There is a higher correlation between unemployment and crime than between income level and crime. If the economic impoverishment thesis for crime holds, unemployed people receiving the UBI would still be equally likely to commit crime. \([Hooge et al, 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262933140_Unemployment_Inequality_Poverty_and_Crime_Spatial_Distribution_Patterns_of_Criminal_Acts_in_Belgium_2001-06)\)
1.1.17.1. Con: This effect is likely to be because it is quite difficult to both obtain and stay on welfare. Thus the unemployed are likely to turn to crime out of economic desperation; a factor that would not occur given a UBI.
1.1.17.1.1. Con: The study in question focuses on Belgium, one of the few countries that offers [unlimited](http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/themes/2015/unemployment_benefits_20151126.pdf) unemployment benefits. There is little difficulty staying on welfare there.
1.1.17.1.1.1. Con: According to [the European Commission the payment of benefits in Belgium](http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1102&intPageId=4425&langId=en\)) is limited to three years. No unemployment insurance scheme exists for self-employed persons, with the exception of a bankruptcy allowance which is not paid by unemployment insurance. The claim that it is 'unlimited' does not seem to hold.
1.1.17.1.2. Pro: In many countries, the benefits system was [designed to be punitive and onerous in order to deter people from claiming without real need](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/working-papers/do-punitive-approaches-to-unemployment-benefit-recipients-increase-welfare-exit-and-employment-a-cross-area-analysis-of-uk-sanctioning-reforms.html). This model is outdated and does not reflect the goals of an enlightened society.
1.1.17.2. Con: While there was a small rise in unemployment under a UBI in [Manitoba, Canada,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincome) during the 1970s, it was uniquely limited to teenagers and new mothers. Both of these were for assumed reasons other than laziness- teenagers were focusing on school, and new mothers were able to provide for their newborns more effectively. Other demographics did not see a major change in employment rates.
1.1.17.2.1. Con: Existing studies on UBI \(in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada for example: [www.cbc.ca](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/basic-income-cheques-going-to-400-households-as-project-gets-off-to-slow-start-1.4329212\))\) did not compare giving cash to receiving other government benefits of equal value. They gave a test group additional cash without taking away existing benefits. These studies don't address the UBI proposed here where the cash benefits are instead of, not in addition to, existing government benefits.
1.1.17.3. Con: Unemployment leads to crime due to economic desperation and alienation. A wealthy unemployed person is not likely to commit crimes.
1.1.17.3.1. Con: A wealthy person is more likely to commit white collar crimes. Less likely to be prosecuted, and more likely to be able to afford a competent defense. They have more to loose, much more leverage, and their criminality is more impactful.
1.1.17.4. Con: Welfare as it stands creates a "perverse incentive"  not to work as especially with low wage jobs, individuals can find themselves worse off. The UBI does not create this perverse incentive.
1.1.17.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.
1.1.17.5. Con: If UBI is irrespective of crime \(criminals will still commit the same crimes as before, with or without a UBI\), then whether a UBI is implemented or not would not matter from this perspective, because the crime rate would be the same. Because of this, it would not hurt to try out a UBI, because people would not be worried any more about increasing crime than now.
1.1.17.5.1. Con: Crime may still increase if people find a UBI to be inadequate.
1.1.17.5.1.1. Con: This is not likely to be a statistically significant increase over current rates of economic crime, and may in fact be a decrease due to people in desperate financial situations who would otherwise prefer to be law-abiding no longer having to risk crime, as they can instead use their UBI to rectify their financial situation.
1.1.17.6. Pro: In this instance, the person doesn't change, just the crime. Instead of welfare fraud, people might commit UBI fraud instead.
1.1.17.6.1. Con: UBI is difficult to defraud due to being universal and unconditional.
1.1.17.6.1.1. Pro: One of the very few ways to defraud a UBI scheme would be to create fictitious claimants, which would be far easier to detect than people simply lying about their circumstances to falsely claim welfare payments.
1.1.18. Pro: UBI reduces the chronic high parental economic stress that daily impacts children and positive outlook that motivates productivity and health.
1.2. Pro: A UBI is more efficient and effective than traditional welfare programs.
1.2.1. Con: It is unfair that people are not receiving benefits on the basis of who is the most vulnerable or in need; the distribution of societal resources should be targeted [at those most in need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls) of opportunities and support.
1.2.1.1. Con: It is unfair that those who are successful in life are treated unequally and excluded from governmental grants.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Those who are successful do not need these government grants to continue to be successful. Those who are struggling do. In either case, the passion and drive to better or add to the world should be the motivating factor, not the money. Thus, a UBI lessens the barrier to entry for such individuals that they may contend with those who are already successful. If they are truly successful on their own merits, it would indeed be fair on the grounds of keeping them honest.
1.2.1.2. Con: Because almost all tax systems are progressive, those who are vulnerable and in need already receive more benefits than those who are better off. If anything a UBI makes this distribution even more progressive.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Giving a UBI to wealthy citizens is a waste of means. The money is way better used to help those in hardship.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: The assumption that wealthy citizens will "waste" the money given to them is not implicit. On the contrary, it is possible that, on average, wealthy citizens will contribute more per "dollar" received than citizens in need.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: [That wealth individuals waste their money by saving it](http://www.nber.org/papers/w7906) [is not an assumption.](http://factmyth.com/factoids/people-with-more-money-save-more/)
1.2.1.3.2. Con: Wealthy citizens will pay more in tax than they receive from the UBI.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: This tax would have been paid anyway, so should not be considered when deciding between a welfare/UBI system.
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: As rich people save more money relative to their income than poor people and savings are macroeconomically bad UBI is inefficient.
1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.6.3.2.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Some people will need more support then others, some will need less; a flat UBI check is probably going to run into a similar problems as flat taxes, and similarly simplistic tax codes. The lack of discretion will hurt those that need more help.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: UBI doesn't account for differences of need between people from disability or illness.
1.2.1.5. Con: Targeted benefits inevitably have arbitrary cutoff points for eligibility, excluding some people who have essentially the same need for support as others, but fall just beyond the cutoff, or who have other extenuating circumstances that aren't addressed by eligibility criteria.
1.2.1.5.1. Con: Cutoffs could be easily removed by using a sliding scale, where applicants can get a variable amount depending on their needs, instead of being eligible for all or nothing depending on a cutoff point.
1.2.1.5.2. Con: This can be addressed by taking care over the criteria, and making sure they are appropriate. In theory the cutoffs should be a good thing, preventing those not in need taking resources which could go to those in need. If this isn't the case in practice, then the criteria simply need revisiting.
1.2.1.6. Con: The UBI does not exclude extra benefits to those who may need them.
1.2.1.7. Pro: A UBI 'takes' money from those who need it to 'give' to those who do not. Those who need money most are given proportionately less than under other welfare distribution systems.
1.2.1.8. Con: Providing the same benefit to every citizen—even wealthy ones—makes it more likely that the UBI will remain dependable. Everyone who receives the UBI has a stake in keeping it going, so the more people who receive it, the more people will vote for officials who support the UBI policy. Social Security uses this strategy, and it's proven impossible for any politician to cut or even reduce benefits.
1.2.1.9. Con: This compromises democracy and encourages a client-patron relationship between groups and the politicians that secure their official "group in need the government must help" status.
1.2.1.10. Pro: Treating unequals, equally, is not egalitarian and will not address current inequalities or produce a more equitable distribution of capital and income wealth as an outcome. Universal access to a basic living wage above the poverty line that uses a simple and automatically-administered mean test would offer all the benefits claimed by a UBI without the cost burden of payments to people who currently don't need any financial assistance.
1.2.2. Pro: Current welfare systems are [complex](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268176421_Complexity_in_welfare_systems_governance_and_the_changing_borders_of_the_third_sector_researching_two_local_multi-sectoral_partnerships) and fragmented between a range of issues and services. This necessitates \(and has resulted in\) a significant [bureaucracy](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/9/6/899569/-) which is highly cost ineffective and reduces the proportion of the welfare budget that is actually distributed.
1.2.2.1. Con: True, but it does not necessitate UBI as a solution \(with new unknown issues\).
1.2.2.1.1. Con: While UBI might not be the only solution, it does have one big advantage: simplicity. It would apply to everyone, so no need for huge administrations handling huge amounts of paperwork, and people wouldn't have to 1-know that they can apply for it \(not always obvious, especially for isolated people\), 2-prepare complicated applications \(which once again can exclude the people who need the most assistance\), 3-wait for said applications to come through \(even though their need might be urgent\).
1.2.2.2. Con: Current welfare systems may or may not be complex/fragmented and require more bureaucracy, but these extra costs should be weighed against the UBI's extra costs: money which is paid to the 100 million \(or so\) people who would already be well off without an income boost. These costs could easily be as high as $500 billion or more per year \(just assuming a mere $420/month payment\).
1.2.2.3. Con: A UBI could be rife with weaknesses compared to traditional welfare programs—or problems of its own—requiring a whole new \(i.e. unfamiliar\) bureaucracy. As a result, the supposed efficiency increases might be nonexistent or likely minimal at best.
1.2.2.3.1. Pro: It is difficult to account for geographical disparities with a blanket dividend such as a UBI. Some areas have higher living costs than others, and with a single UBI amount, you will either not be giving enough to recipients in some areas, or you will be giving proportionally too much to recipients in other areas to account for geographical differences.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Con: People can choose where they want to live, balancing tradeoffs such as cost of living vs services available and lifestyle. A UBI would prevent government from implicitly subsidizing certain geographic areas.
1.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The cost to move is finite. Unless a newly implemented UBI accounts for this cost, some people in high cost of living areas will be trapped.
1.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It would be up to an individual to work a job to earn the funds to make a move to a city with lower living costs where the UBI will carry more financial weight. Undeveloped regions would begin to grow as a result of this incentive.
1.2.2.3.1.2. Con: It is difficult, but it is not impossible. A UBI could be tied to the productivity of the areas and the total amount of the UBI payments for certain areas could be used to encourage or discourage migration.
1.2.2.3.1.2.1. Con: There is no support that a central regulating body would be capable of making such complex analyses; on the contrary, it seems unlikely that such regulating bodies would be capable of efficiently/accurately doing this.
1.2.2.3.1.3. Con: Perhaps it would actually help reduce disparities: if everyone had a basic safety net they knew they could count on, it would make it easier to look for a good job \(even if they need to quit a bad one first\) or to start a business, which is especially difficult in historically underprivileged areas where there are almost no jobs around.
1.2.2.3.1.4. Con: A UBI could account for geographic disparities in cost of living \(COL\) which would have the advantage of enabling people to move to cheaper areas with far less risk and allowing for income to be injected into areas with no current job market. UBI would therefore help alleviate COL disparities and create many new markets.
1.2.2.3.1.5. Con: UBIs would encourage people who can work remotely to move to areas with low costs of living. This could lead to a repopulation of neglected rural areas and take housing pressure off cities.
1.2.2.3.1.6. Con: Cost of living is easily and regularly calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. [bls.gov](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/)
1.2.2.3.2. Pro: A UBI is subject to fraud.
1.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: In the US, [federal agencies](https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/fraud-and-abuse) are often sloppy in their administration of programs, and Congress provides little serious oversight.
1.2.2.3.2.1.1. Con: A UBI is much easier to administer than other welfare programs — all it requires is that the government send a check. This has little margin for error or exploitation.
1.2.2.3.2.1.2. Con: By the same argument, the military has documented waste in the billions, year after year. Yet it is tolerated in the name of the greater good.
1.2.2.3.2.1.2.1. Con: It is not well tolerated by some; there are plentiful criticisms of the American military, both inside and outside America.
1.2.2.3.2.1.2.2. Con: This claim aides that the central government presiding over the military will have difficulties preventing UBI fraud if the same government wastes billions on other programs.
1.2.2.3.2.1.3. Con: This is just as much an argument for no UBI as it is for a UBI.
1.2.2.3.2.1.4. Con: This is a systemic issue of congress and federal agencies, and shouldn't relate to UBI specifically. This is an issue which should be addressed regardless of subject matter.
1.2.2.3.2.1.4.1. Con: If we accept that congress is sloppy, etc. then to say that we should implement this policy without first fixing said issue seems ill advised.
1.2.2.3.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Using this argument we should stop building schools because some construction companies are corrupt.
1.2.2.3.2.1.4.2. Con: We are discussing UBI specifically. The systemic issue existing does not detract from its affects on UBI and fraud.
1.2.2.3.2.2. Con: Whereas conditional income assistance can be exploited by taking the money without a genuine effort to move out of the program, a universal system has no such conditions and thus there is less room for exploitation.
1.2.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: [In Kenya,](http://basicincome.org/news/2016/11/kenya-unconditional-cash-transfers-towards-unconditional-basic-income-randomized-controlled-trial-come/) the move from conditional to unconditional payouts is underway, and the effects are mostly positive, with little abuse of the system.
1.2.2.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: A 12 year basic income experiment in [Kenya](http://nordic.businessinsider.com/kenya-village-disproving-biggest-myth-about-basic-income-2017-12) shows that people typically spend this money on necessities like education, medicine, and food.
1.2.2.3.2.3. Con: Because a UBI is unconditional, benefit fraud will likely decrease. The need to forge documents or misrepresent the truth in order to obtain benefits will become obsolete.
1.2.2.3.2.3.1. Pro: Because everyone knows exactly how much and how often they should be receiving their payments, there is almost no room for corruption.
1.2.2.3.2.3.2. Con: Not obsolete - the room for fraud/corruption would be almost entirely limited to attempting to claim for another person - alive, dead, or fictional.
1.2.2.3.2.3.2.1. Con: Which is likely still more easily uncovered than most welfare fraud committed today.
1.2.2.3.2.3.3. Pro: UBI registration will encourage a more accurate population count, thus removing the need for an expensive census. The stringency of registration rules would affect the subsequent rate of fraud within the system.
1.2.2.3.2.3.3.1. Con: The census data is richer than that collected via a UBI.
1.2.2.3.2.4. Pro: Fraudulent use could include people creating false documentation in order to get paid more than once.
1.2.2.3.2.4.1. Con: In order to avoid overspending on fraudulent persons, there is an incentive to monitor for fraud more carefully.
1.2.2.3.2.4.2. Con: The inventives for identiy theft/fraud are already strong in developed economies. It is unclear that extracting traceable regular, relatively small UBI payments will be more attractive than e.g untraceable one-off, high value credit card fraud.
1.2.2.3.2.5. Pro: Fraudulent use of the funds could include people claiming the UBI payments of care-dependent or deceased relatives.
1.2.2.3.2.5.1. Con: Deceased people can easily be removed from eligibility lists when they are registered as dead.
1.2.2.3.2.5.1.1. Con: Family members may just not register someone as dead and receive their benefits indefinitely.
1.2.2.3.2.5.1.1.1. Con: The difficulties involved in hiding a death would rapidly make this infeasible - funerals, closure of accounts and estates, the deceased's disappearance from public and social life, grieving of friends and families, etc. would all be telltale signs. Furthermore, the steps necessary to conceal each of these things \(even temporarily; they likely could not be hid indefinitely at all\) would be unlikely and difficult for a grieving family to implement, even if deliberately pre-planned.
1.2.2.3.2.5.2. Con: Care-dependent people still merit a UBI payment. If those providing their care are collecting it and spending it on their behalf - with their permission - it is unclear why this is a problem.
1.2.2.3.2.5.2.1. Con: The problem is that the family members may not actually be spending it on behalf of the care-dependent; they may just be taking it for themselves.
1.2.2.3.2.5.2.1.1. Con: This would constitute financial abuse, which already happens with present-day pensions and disability and care payments. It is a separate issue, not an argument specifically against the UBI.
1.2.2.3.2.5.2.1.1.1. Con: It is an argument specifically against the UBI because prevention methods would be less effective with UBI. That is to say, even if stronger laws/enforcement against this kind of financial abuse are enacted, the introduction of a UBI would increase the amount of financial abuse by making it far easier and widespread/applicable.
1.2.2.3.2.5.3. Con: This is already a problem with traditional disability benefits, and is not an issue specific to UBI.
1.2.2.3.2.6. Con: UBI reduces the types of fraud possible to just identity fraud. This makes it much simpler and easier to fight than many types of fraud: the only question is "Are you who you say you are?"
1.2.2.3.2.6.1. Pro: Most countries have a national ID number, and UBI could certainly be implemented alongside a stronger national identification database.
1.2.2.3.2.6.2. Con: That is not the only question that needs to be asked; people must also ask "is the person still alive," "are they actually receiving the money or is a family member taking it without their consent," etc.
1.2.2.3.2.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.5.
1.2.2.3.2.6.3. Con: It's easier to fake an identity, than to fake an identity and make it look qualified to whichever entitlement program is being defrauded.
1.2.2.3.2.7. Con: All government benefits are subject to some degree of fraud. A UBI is less subject to fraud due to its universal availability and equal distribution. The need to commit fraud is reduced along with the bureaucracy required to manage social benefit programs.
1.2.2.3.2.7.1. Pro: Controlling one universal income which applies to everyone with no distinction is easier than multiple sources of financial help that depend on the person's characteristics.
1.2.2.3.2.7.2. Con: All government benefits are subject to fraud, including a UBI. Therefore no government benefit program should exist, including UBI.
1.2.2.3.2.7.2.1. Con: Ignoring the plight of large numbers of poor people can lead to rioting and other disruptions of peace.
1.2.2.3.2.7.3. Con: The universal availability and equal distribution would actually make it more susceptible to fraud, because there's less scrutiny so it's easier to just invent a fake identity and collect multiple payments. With the current entitlement system, in addition to creating the fake identity, you have to make that fake identity look eligible for the entitlement.
1.2.2.3.2.8. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.2.2.3.2.9. Con: Converting a welfare system to UBI, would reduce welfare fraud. Most fraud is not from the benefit recipients, but companies that are contracted to provide services. UBI makes the individual responsible for selecting the provider.
1.2.2.3.2.9.1. Pro: Allowing recipients to select their own providers can save money on contracting and oversight for the companies selected to provide traditional welfare services.
1.2.2.3.2.9.1.1. Pro: It also allows for competition in service quality even when offering services to the less wealthy.
1.2.2.3.2.9.2. Con: Just because the individual is responsible for selecting the provider it doesn't mean that they will make a good choice.
1.2.2.3.2.10. Con: All economic activities are subject to fraud. With each method of potential for fraud a subsequent law can be created to address this issue.
1.2.2.3.2.10.1. Pro: Fraudulent activity can happen in just about any domain \(e.g. [fish fraud](http://nationalpost.com/life/food/mystery-fish-study-finds-rampant-fish-fraud-in-ottawa-restaurants-and-sushi-spots)\). This does not invalidate the domain - i.e. fish fraud doesn't invalidate the fish trade.
1.2.2.3.2.10.2. Con: A good law is one which doesn’t require additional laws to enforce it. If a new law will throw the governed into a quagmire of elaborating laws, and new regulations, perhaps that is criteria enough for not passing the law?
1.2.2.3.2.11. Con: [Blockchain](https://futurism.com/the-first-blockchain-based-universal-basic-income-experiment-just-launched/) can be used to set up a transparent, immutable UBI system, that can be verified by anyone. [Grantcoin](http://www.grantcoin.org/) is an example of an UBI project that runs on the blockchain. It has been running for more than a year.
1.2.2.3.2.11.1. Pro: Part of the answer to the problem of income inequality and meeting basic human needs will come from technology. Block chains could be a cost effective platform to create better mechanisms for managing public welfare spending.
1.2.2.3.2.11.2. Con: Implementing UBI on a blockchain would need to go together with major social education and implementation of matching payment methods.
1.2.2.3.2.11.3. Con: Blockchain contracts are also vulnerable, and can fail in spectacular ways. [A hacker stoles $31 M of ether](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-hacker-stole-31m-of-ether-how-it-happened-and-what-it-means-for-ethereum-9e5dc29e33ce)
1.2.2.3.2.12. Pro: A UBI would incentivize certain people to have children irresponsibly so they can receive more money "for them".
1.2.2.3.2.12.1. Con: The amount it takes to have, and raise a child far exceeds any realistic universal income people would receive by doing so.
1.2.2.3.2.12.1.1. Con: This cuts against the purpose of the UBI, which is to ensure that no one falls below a basic poverty line. It's important that parents of many children aren't significantly worse off than childless adults.
1.2.2.3.2.12.2. Con: This same incentive also exists under traditional welfare programs, most of which provide additional benefits to dependents.
1.2.2.3.2.12.3. Con: The [annual cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_raising_a_child#United_States) of raising a child is likely more than a base income of, for example, ten thousand dollars. Welfare policies give benefits to parents, but that happens only because governments acknowledge the immense cost that goes with it.
1.2.2.3.2.12.3.1. Con: Even if provided with a UBI, people would continue to work in order to ensure better education and resources for their children.
1.2.2.3.2.12.3.2. Con: A UBI is not meant to cover all familiar needs, but gives an incentive to parents that otherwise could not afford raising a child only with their jobs.
1.2.2.3.2.12.3.3. Con: No welfare policy is given solely out of recognising immense costs. The government would not be financially incentivising something it does not want to encourage.
1.2.2.3.2.12.3.3.1. Con: Medicare and other provisions of healthcare are given out because the government recognizes the immense costs of healthcare for the elderly and disabled.
1.2.2.3.2.12.3.4. Con: Children would likely be included in a UBI. An extra income would cover many of the expenses related to a child.
1.2.2.3.2.12.4. Con: Deliberately claiming another's money and using it against their best interests would constitute domestic abuse, which would be penalized and thus disincentivized.
1.2.2.3.2.12.4.1. Con: This would mean that a parent who buys food for their child \(paid for partly by the child's UBI\) would be commiting domestic abuse, which seems absurd. In practice, a UBI would probably allocate a children's income to their parents until they are 18 or not living at home.
1.2.2.3.2.12.4.2. Con: Irresponsible use of children's UBI payments by parents is too hard to police properly.
1.2.2.3.2.12.5. Con: This is nothing but supposition.
1.2.2.3.2.12.6. Con: This argument doesn't apply to a UBI. A UBI is generally considered to be an amount that is paid to everybody, and everybody gets the same amount. It is not dependant on individual circumstances.
1.2.2.3.2.12.6.1. Con: And because this amount is unconditionally paid to everybody, also to children, a UBI creates an inherent incentive to give birth to many children. As legal guardians, parents can freely dispose of the children's UBI.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7. Con: A UBI encourages more people to have children, solving the low birth rate problem that exists in many Western countries.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.1. Con: Countries with relatively high Human Development Index \(HDI\) ratings experience a [demographic transition](http://www.economist.com/node/14164483): fertility \(defined as the number of children born by a woman over her lifetime\) drops from around eight to near one and a half. As a UBI would further increase the HDI rating of a country \(in particular the income per person aspect\) this trend is likely to intensify.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.1.1. Con: One explanation of this phenomenon is the extensive entering of women into the [the workplace](http://www.economist.com/node/14164483). A UBI would mitigate the need for a job and enable women to focus on their motherhood, if wished. This could raise fertility rates again.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.1.1.1. Con: This assumes women enter the workforce because they need to, rather than because they want to.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Exactly how many people enter the workforce because they want to? Since when is joining the capitalist system vs being a marginalized "poor" outcast, a choice? People who "choose" to work are already either enjoying some kind of unearned income, or have lowered their quality of life to conform to what little they may legally get for free in the system.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.1.1.2. Con: The financial independence would allow women to pursue individual enrichment, such as gaining education, a desired career, an artistic pursuit, or travel opportunities. This freedom will let them put off motherhood until they are financially secure; thereby reducing birth rates
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.1.1.2.1. Con: Motherhood can be considered among the many forms of individual enrichment a woman might pursue.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.1.1.2.2. Con: That is not the case if having more children would increase the amount of money they would receive.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.1.2. Pro: If rich countries generally have [lower](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html) fertility rates, childcare costs are not the only [factor](https://evolution-institute.org/article/why-do-modern-people-have-so-few-children/) decreasing fertility and thus a monetary increase like a UBI is unlikely to boost it.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.1.3. Con: This claim indirectly implies we should avoid developing countries \(or reducing poverty\) in order to increase the birth rates. This is barbaric.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.2. Pro: The lack of [financial resources](http://www.rawstory.com/2016/08/the-real-reason-were-not-having-kids/) is an important reason why many individuals hold off on having children. A UBI mitigate this issue and helps the affected individuals to fulfil their desire to have children.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.2.1. Pro: The [average child](http://www.rawstory.com/2016/08/the-real-reason-were-not-having-kids/) in the U.S. represents an investment of $304,500 from the moment of birth to the child's 18th birthday. This is a significant amount.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.2.2. Pro: In the USA [child-care costs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/06/the-staggering-cost-of-daycare-when-you-make-only-the-minimum-wage/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.f500cb489981) account for at least 30 percent of a minimum-wage worker’s earnings. In New York and Massachusetts the cost rises to as much as 80 percent.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.2.3. Pro: Surveys have shown that [European](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html) women want to have two or more children \(2.36 on average\). While countries in north-west Europe approach that number, in southern Europe they do not. Government action in the former, through child benefits, tax breaks, maternity leave or nursery provisions, may be a key factor.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.2.4. Con: UBI contributes to the planet's biggest future problem, that of over-population. By removing the responsibility of being able to afford having children, it will lead to a vicious downward spiral of starvation and violence as more people compete for less and less life-sustaining resources such as food and water.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.2.4.1. Con: Over population should be considered a serious problem but using financial positions to keep people from reproducing is perhaps an irresponsible approach. If we need to be careful with our population then that issue should be addressed directly and honestly and people should be informed of it rather than relying on an unrelated aspect of society to steer some people away.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.2.5. Con: That claim is very much contrary to the evidence of the people that have more children are generally low income.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.2.6. Con: It may not be a good idea for people who do not have moneymaking know-how or a sense of responsibility to raise children who would grow up to have similar traits.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.2.6.1. Con: In a society under UBI, "responsibility" would become far more diverse than simply "providing for yourself" and "not living beyond your means".
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.3. Con: The birth rate [isn't too bad](https://www.google.com/search?q=birth+rate+in+us&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS750US750&oq=birth+rate&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.13972j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). This assumes that finances are the main reason people don't have more kids.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.4. Con: There is no reason to assume low birth rates would be a problem.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.4.1. Pro: A birth rate below the replacement rate reduces human population \(without harming\), which is arguably desirable in this current state of overpopulation.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.4.2. Con: A low birth rate in one area or cultural segment will lead that segment to disappear in the long term, hence being taken over by other ways of thinking or living.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.4.2.1. Con: The disappearance of certain cultural segments is not necessarily a bad thing.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.4.2.1.1. Pro: The existence of certain cultural segments is not objectively good or bad for the society, therefore it is hard to argue with certainty that their disappearance will be bad.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.4.2.1.2. Pro: Many cultural segments have disappeared along human history and it is hard to quantify whether this fact was detrimental to humanity as a whole in terms other than intuition.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.4.2.1.3. Pro: The disappearance of certain cultural segments and the appearance of new ones is one of the factors that enables cultural evolution.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.5. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.12.2.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.6. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.12.3.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.7. Con: The World population \(and US population\) are climbing rapidly. China, India and Sub-Saharan Africa are currently overpopulated, requiring significant food imports to sustain the population.
1.2.2.3.2.12.7.8. Con: Lower birth rates might be a better way of conserving resources especially among those with greater difficulty with job retention strengths.
1.2.2.3.2.12.8. Con: A UBI incentivises individuals to pursue their own individual aspirations by eliminating the barriers of poverty. Those who no longer envision their lives as being stuck in a multigenerational cycle of poverty would be less inclined to limit their options through an accidental pregnancy and less inclined to see the benefit of having a child when they could pursue their individual goals instead.
1.2.2.3.2.12.9. Con: The distribution for having children could be based upon the marginal cost of an extra child as determined by the poverty guidelines. This would greatly diminish this effect.
1.2.2.3.2.13. Con: A UBI is less prone than other forms of welfare to fraud due to the fact that many points of interaction are outright removed, meaning many forms of fraud are outright impossible.
1.2.2.3.2.13.1. Con: As an attacker, the fewer points of interaction there are, the fewer interactions I have to successfully fake. This makes it easier to attack.
1.2.2.4. Con: Current welfare systems are already highly efficient. Empirical evidence shows that at [least 90%, if not 99%, of the capital used](http://www.cbpp.org/research/romneys-charge-that-most-federal-low-income-spending-goes-for-overhead-and-bureaucrats-is?fa=view&id=3655) for American welfare systems goes towards the beneficiaries.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: While the efficiencies of the current welfare systems are already high, that doesn't mean they couldn't be more efficient.
1.2.2.4.1.1. Con: With that high level of efficiency it is possibly less risky and costly to try something else than to further upgrade current system.
1.2.2.4.1.2. Con: The main issue addressed by the [grandparent claim](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1634.1730) is the misconception that traditional welfare programs are highly inefficient. It does not need to prove that traditional welfare is more efficient than UBIs; rather, the parent here needs to suggest that UBIs are more efficient than traditional welfare—and quantify that improvement, to the extent possible.
1.2.2.4.2. Con: This doesn't address whether the benefits are good value. For example, technically speaking most of the money spent on public housing goes towards the beneficiaries, but results in very poor quality housing compared to housing offered by the private sector for the same cost. [www.politico.com](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/20/how-san-francisco-turned-its-tenements-into-treasures-215391)
1.2.2.4.2.1. Con: While it may be true that means-tested welfare provides "perfect quality," UBI could be just as bad or even worse.
1.2.2.4.2.2. Con: [The politico article](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/20/how-san-francisco-turned-its-tenements-into-treasures-215391) seems to suggest that the public-private partnership system was a successful case of targeted/means-tested housing subsidies/benefits.
1.2.2.4.3. Con: Time spent and labor done by the beneficiaries must also be included when comparing costs of opt-in and opt-out systems.
1.2.2.4.3.1. Con: This is a valid consideration, but without quantification/support, we should not assume that factor is significant.
1.2.2.4.4. Con: This is of little importance if the capital doesn't achieve what it's meant to: helping people in need. This must be the primary measure; to what extent the capital improves people's lives.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Navigating bureaucracy takes time that a person can better spend seeking employment, caring for others, in leisure or in the community.
1.2.2.6. Con: While UBI may simplify many forms of welfare, a system to provide additional means-tested benefits is needed. To be fair the UBI sufficient for a single home-owning person will not meet the needs of a single person with children having to pay rent. Not all the bureaucracy disappears.
1.2.2.6.1. Con: Children would also receive a UBI.
1.2.2.6.2. Con: It would not have to eliminate other assistance.
1.2.2.6.3. Pro: UBI could replace the basic unemployment benefit but systems would still be required to provide other welfare benefits such as disability, child care, etc. The admin savings claimed may not be as great as claimed.
1.2.2.7. Pro: Income redistribution agencies absorb about two-thirds to three-quarters of each dollar budgeted to them in overhead costs. Using government data, Robert L. Woodson \(1989, p. 63\) calculated that, on average, 70 cents of each dollar budgeted for government assistance goes not to the poor, but to the members of the welfare bureaucracy and others serving the poor. Michael Tanner \(1996, p. 136 n. 18\) cites regional studies supporting this 70/30 split.
1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.
1.2.4. Pro: The reliability of a UBI allows the poor the ability to better plan and budget their spending.
1.2.4.1. Con: Bad financial decision-making is part of the problem for many who might find themselves in need of welfare. Asking them to just fix that problem by making better decisions seems at best to be a utopian aspiration.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: The "poverty trap" often includes debts and excessive bills forcing desperate measures just to survive in the short term. Many objectively "bad" decisions are forced by desperation \(and/or impaired judgement from stress and the resulting exhaustion\), or seem to be the only/best option at the time. Alleviating that pressure would help them to make better decisions in a very practical way.
1.2.4.2. Pro: A UBI provides some income even if salary is being delayed for various reasons, mostly financial results of the employer. Welfare doesn't usually cover this.
1.2.5. Con: Because a UBI provides cash payments it becomes impossible for governments to direct welfare spending in order to promote positive choices.
1.2.5.1. Pro: For example, food vouchers can be used to direct the spending of the poor towards improving their diet and away from harmful choices such as drugs or alcohol.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: At-risk families will tend towards addiction and spend a UBI on marijuana, drugs, alcohol and/or cigarettes. This would make these type of families more dependent on Social Services, costing the government even more. Funding like food stamps for all, is better as it restricts purchases to certain socially agreed tradable items. However recipients can still work and so earn money to purchase luxury items.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Welfare programs often offer direct rebates for purchases that aid in securing employment, such as buying professional clothes or repairing a car need for a commute.
1.2.5.3. Con: People do not use their transfers from the government to buy alcohol, tobacco or wasteful items, [the vast majority used the money responsibly](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/do-poor-waste-transfers-booze-and-cigarettes-no).
1.2.5.4. Con: Even targeted assistance programs only place soft limits on spending. Any assistance that can be used to purchase goods \(ie food stamps\) [can be easily sold on a black market](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/19/food-stamp-black-market-rise/).
1.2.5.5. Pro: Effective use of welfare monies requires that individuals actually spend income on measures that improve their welfare. A UBI cannot guarantee this - which in the long run is more likely to perpetuate the social problem in question, compared to means testing or in-kind assistance.
1.2.5.6. Con: Increased financial security does not remove poor life choices. Disfunctional families with many kids and a low standard of education could potentially put enormous pressure on the service & society as a whole.
1.2.5.6.1. Con: There is no reason why a UBI cannot be implemented simultaneously with other programs designed to help prevent or minimize such occurrences, and/or their impact.
1.2.5.6.2. Con: If the same UBI is given to each person regardless of circumstances, people making poor life choices would not put any more pressure on the system than those making good ones.
1.2.5.6.3. Con: While it does not remove poor life choices, it does mitigate their impact by providing a financial buffer and safety net.
1.2.5.7. Con: It is not an absolute requirement of UBI that it is all in cash - and even if it was, who is to determine what are "worthy" purchases that poor people might be permitted to buy? The point of UBI is to restore individual agency, rather than prescribe how its recipients are to comport themselves.
1.2.5.8. Con: Unlike targeted welfare, the point of UBI is precisely to empower people financially and spend such money freely, not being forced to follow a specific worldview as to which spending is positive and which is negative.
1.2.5.8.1. Pro: It is not the role of the government in a free society to direct the life choices of its citizens, so long as those life choices do not infringe on the rights of other citizens. The point of UBI is that the citizens themselves, and not the government, are better at deciding how their aid money can be best spent to most efficiently help their lives.
1.2.5.9. Pro: Monetization of benefits makes subsidized sectors of economy \(healthcare, education, transport\) more vulnerable to market volatility.
1.2.5.10. Pro: Current social welfare programs are seen as entitlements by the recipients, rather than as welfare programs. The same will happen to UBI. Cash disbursements have a tendency to be misused. What is needed is are soup kitchens, night shelters, used clothing distribution, free schooling and free healthcare. Provide for basic needs; not cash disbursements.
1.2.5.10.1. Con: This claim contains no proof that its suggested methods would be any more effective than the provision of a UBI.
1.2.5.10.2. Con: Providing a UBI does not prevent any of these things from being implemented, and may in fact allow more time for individuals to provide labour to such causes.
1.2.5.11. Pro: With UBI, the poor will continue to spend their provided income in an unclever manner, and the rich will capitalize on the provided income and earn the poors' income in the end. Leading to no problems solved. A better solution is to provide services to those who need them.
1.2.5.11.1. Con: Some of the poor as well as some of the rich will continue to spend their income in ways which are not clever, regardless if they have an UBI or not. This means this is not a point in favor or against implementation of an UBI, because the UBI would indeed solve problems for those who do spend their income in clever ways. So, unless it can be demonstrated that all the poor would act in this way, this argument has no bearing on the outcome of the UBI.
1.2.5.12. Con: The government can still influence the spending by taxing undesirable items, such as cigarettes or alcohol, less favourably.
1.2.5.13. Pro: A UBI will have millions of dependents who will make subsequent changes or removal of the program impossible.
1.2.5.14. Con: "Positive choices" are, or can be, subjective.
1.2.6. Con: Traditional welfare programs \(e.g. social grants or infrastructure provision\) allow governments to target specific issues in specific communities, a benefit that is not available with a UBI.
1.2.6.1. Pro: There are groups in society who require more support from the state than others. For example, those with illnesses and disabilities who require specialist care cannot live off a small amount of money but have no ability to work to increase their income.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: In every case except for those who are not physically healthy or able, the UBI will be sufficient for living expenses because that is how the amount is determined.
1.2.6.1.1.1. Con: Cost of living differs drastically by region. For example, if a UBI in the United States is set at the poverty line, those who live in Manhattan will not be able to afford basic living expenses.
1.2.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Initiatives like the [London Living Wage](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/business-and-economy/london-living-wage) calculate how much more money people living in an expensive city need in comparison to other places. Although this is a voluntary approach for businesses, a similar compulsory measure could be included in a UBI.
1.2.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This would result in uneven wages, giving people incentive to move into cities. This would compound itself over time, making it more expensive to operate and more difficult to fund.
1.2.6.1.2. Pro: The loss of those extra support resources from targeted welfare schemes could lead to dire health problems for the chronically ill, who may no longer be able to afford adequate healthcare under private or increasingly privatized systems.
1.2.6.1.3. Con: The medical treatment of illnesses and disabilities is covered by health insurance. A UBI enables individuals to pay for theirs.
1.2.6.1.3.1. Con: If an individual is allotted $10k a year worth of UBI payments, it would be not enough to cover health care costs in addition to daily living expenditures.
1.2.6.1.3.1.1. Con: It would be $10,000 in addition to their employment income, which would be enough for people to afford most health care services.
1.2.6.1.4. Pro: Groups with special needs, such as the severely ill or disabled, are able to get greater levels of assistance under targeted welfare programs than what a UBI would offer.
1.2.6.1.4.1. Pro: Across [the many different welfare systems](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/15/which-best-countries-live-unemployed-disabled-benefits), disability payments either exceed or top-up existing unemployment/welfare payments.
1.2.6.1.5. Con: It is right to defend a system where the poor are no longer forced into government endorsed establishments. Most benefits are in-kind: only 24% of US government benefits are direct cash assistance where governments have the authority to dictate what kinds of products the poor buy and who they buy those products from \([Brenkman, p. 125](http://bien2016.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/BIEN2016_Sess4_Brenkman_en.pdf)\).
1.2.6.1.6. Con: In systems with no public universal healthcare, the fact that the UBI helps the poor pay for their health will create demand for clinics that offer rates cheap enough for low income earners to afford.
1.2.6.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.3.1.
1.2.6.1.6.2. Con: This requires doing so to be profitable, and it is not clear that even with access to a UBI, the poor in countries without universal healthcare - like America - would be able to pay enough to make opening low-cost clinics worthwhile.
1.2.6.1.7. Con: Under a system of in-kind welfare, governments are responsible for responding to the needs of constituents where they often inaccurately underestimate the needs of those with chronic illnesses. Market incentives provide competition and choice to people who are diverse with differential needs.
1.2.6.1.7.1. Con: The market does not care about those who cannot afford their products.
1.2.6.2. Pro: In Australia, parents who refuse to [vaccinate](http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/13/asia/australia-anti-vaccination-welfare-cut/) their children can lose up to $11,000 in benefits a year since this refusal is not supported by taxpayers or public policy.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: There is no reason why a UBI couldn't have basic requirements attached to them, such as vaccinations, schooling, and other public health and safety needs.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Con: Making UBI contingent on people obeying government mandates, no matter how reasonable, compromises the universal part: there's a real risk of it becoming the government paying people to make certain choices and not others.
1.2.6.3. Pro: Society has the principled right to build paternalistic incentives into its provision of welfare, since welfare is funded through taking away money from the rest of the taxpayers and giving it to a particular person. As such, taxpayers should be able to impose conditions on the receipt of that money.
1.2.6.3.1. Pro: When the rest of society grants money, charitably, to certain individuals, it is perfectly reasonable to design the conditions of that money to encourage the recipient to make socially optimal, rather than individually optimal, decisions.
1.2.6.3.2. Con: Foremost society has a duty to help underprivileged citizens according to the basic human rights in the constitution, instead of a right to demand certain behaviors.
1.2.6.3.3. Con: The structure of those programs is decided by people who have enough power to get a majority of the legislature to vote in their favor — and that is rarely the powerless. There's no reason to expect that such conditions, imposed by the powerful on the weak — would have the effect of protecting the weak from the powerful.
1.2.6.4. Pro: Even if some claim that people are fully rational actors, they may not fully understand the consequences of their actions - as, for example, we can see in parents who fail to vaccinate their children. Therefore, welfare programs are needed because they act as incentive systems.
1.2.6.4.1. Con: If welfare must be used to give people incentive to follow common sense then they should apply to everyone, not just the less fortunate. As it currently stands only low-income households are forced to vaccinate, leaving people with middle to high tier income to do as they please \(despite the potential harm to the child and surrounding community.\)
1.2.6.5. Con: There are better ways for the government to encourage behaviour such as criminal laws or broad country-wide incentives that falls on everyone.
1.2.6.5.1. Con: One of the biggest conditions for welfare is proving that you are looking for a [job](http://www.welfareinfo.org/). The government can not just make it illegal to not look for a job.
1.2.6.5.1.1. Con: That is the current status quo, yes. However I don't think that universal basic income is as entrenched in the idea that everyone should be working all the time as welfare currently is. Universal basic income is a system that should be applied as effectively in a fully employed community as one that has no one working. Welfare on the other hand was made as a hold-over for people between jobs, hence it needs to be proven you're actually looking for a job to get welfare benefits.
1.2.6.6. Con: People refuse vaccines, use drugs, or contribute to various 'issues' for reasons other than welfare. To punish those individuals by leaving them outside of the welfare system is a violation of their basic dignity.
1.2.6.7. Con: People living in poverty have problems related to a lack of money - a UBI provides it, precisely in proportion to the degree of poverty a person experiences. A UBI is as tightly targeted as a social program can be.
1.2.6.8. Con: The whole point of a UBI is to target poverty, whatever the cause.  If specific communities are poor, they will be implicitly targeted by a UBI; but targeting them explicitly is inherently discriminatory and generates ill-feeling toward those communities.
1.2.6.9. Con: UBI allows for the government to be able to cover almost everyone's needs using only one system. Subsequent welfare programs that are smaller in size can then be established to help certain individuals.
1.2.6.10. Con: Means testing is actually not a benefit, it's expensive to administer, inevitably "gaps" people, and generates public resentment towards the recipients.
1.2.6.11. Pro: Not every person has the same cost of basic needs \(i.e a large person has to buy more food and costly clothes\).
1.2.6.12. Con: Politicians focusing intervention on specific groups fosters corruption, as well as making those groups beholden to the politicians that keep them under the focus of welfare.
1.2.6.12.1. Pro: Out of a pool of equally needy people, politicians have incentive to enter into a cooperative relationship with the most organized, most politically active groups: this would basically amount to people who can otherwise not get enough money being forced to vote for whoever promises to keep them on welfare, as well as leave out people who might be needy, but are not a part of one of these client groups.
1.2.6.12.2. Pro: Welfare programs are there to support low-income people. Low-income people are the most vulnerable to be controlled through a program grant. Giving the individuals the possibility of deciding how to apply their income would prevent polítical or sectorial interests from controlling those people.
1.2.6.13. Pro: UBI trusts the poor to make informed choices, however, in books like [Poor Economics](https://www.pooreconomics.com/about-book) we come across how poor make unhealthy/imprudent choices \(such as bad calories American poor consume\) leading to a poverty trap. Targeted subsidies of goods/services that a particular income are likely to consume is a far better approach, especially to make education and healthcare accessible. However, a UBI may work in places where people are educated and / or aware above average levels.
1.2.6.14. Pro: There is a limit to how many jobs are available in most sectors. A UBI would allow some people to work in "uncapped sectors" that may not be as economically rewarding as a conventional job, but allows for people to take the jobs they leave behind in favor of things like painting, writing or teaching yoga.
1.2.6.15. Pro: When done properly, welfare programs can target specific issues in a community that UBI does not - In fact a UBI can exacerbate the problem e.g. giving a drug addict UBI instead of implementing opioid substitution programs.
1.2.6.16. Pro: If poor social outcomes are concentrated in certain geographic areas, governments can offer public housing in different neighborhoods. This incentivizes individuals to move out of poorer areas, more than cash handouts.
1.2.6.16.1. Pro: Universal basic income will lead to a sharp split in cheap and expensive housing. Those whom have trouble getting work or don't want to are likely to opt for cheaper, similar housing in 
whatever the housing in the Ubi's pricing bracket will be. Such a sharp split in housing quality is visually unappealing and enables class segregation.
1.2.6.16.2. Con: Moving out of poorer areas does not improve one's poverty status. However, a UBI can improve the economic status of those in poorer areas, allowing them to contribute to ameliorating the community.
1.2.6.17. Con: A UBI would allow people to choose freely which area of their life needs the most urgent improvement.
1.2.6.17.1. Pro: Food and health is not necessarily what everyone needs. For example, someone might want to pay for a suit so that they can excel in their interview and land a job.
1.2.6.17.1.1. Con: Some [needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) are more basic than others. Without food or proper health it is unlikely someone will obtain or commit to a job.
1.2.6.17.1.1.1. Con: Even if these are more fundamental needs, the UBI does not preclude people from spending their UBI on these needs.
1.2.6.17.2. Pro: No one can target benefits more precisely than the beneficiary. Specially not a bureaucrat.
1.2.6.17.2.1. Con: People have a long history of acting against their best interests.
1.2.6.17.2.2. Con: Sometimes at least, bureaucracies use weighted measures  and careful consideration; their value should not be underestimated.
1.2.6.17.2.3. Con: Bureaucrats implement other people's policies, so they would not be deciding.
1.2.6.17.2.4. Con: People often don't know best what they need, or even what will make them happy.
1.2.6.17.2.4.1. Con: The clarity of a need is proportional to how pressing the need is; thus those most in need would be more likely to address their needs.
1.2.6.17.2.4.1.1. Con: This assumes that individuals will generally act rationality, but this is a flawed assumption. Given this, "free range" money reasonably may not always lead to better provision of needs than traditional welfare.
1.2.6.17.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: Gambling is generally an irrational activity: it is empirically and theoretically known to \(occasionally\) be addictive, financially destructive, and mathematically illogical. Yet people still engage in this activity.
1.2.6.17.2.4.1.1.2. Pro: All people exhibit some degree of cognitive biases and other basic "thinking mistakes." One of the most notable is that of planning failure, as exemplified through procrastination. Another common example is that of the [gambler's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy), which causes some people to inaccurately assess the probability of crucial outcomes. Other important examples include [egotistical and confirmation biases](https://www.inc.com/sam-mcroberts/7-cognitive-biases-that-are-holding-you-back.html), such as where we choose to believe something simply because we want it to be true.
1.2.6.17.2.4.1.1.3. Pro: Hard drug usage \(e.g. meth, heroine, crack\) is generally considered to be an irrational activity, sometimes brought on by misleading environmental information. For example, if someone is misled by friends or the general culture he lives in that the drugs are not harmful—or that the habit is sustainable and the pleasure outweighs the harm—then they may irrationally turn to such drug usage.
1.2.6.17.3. Con: Some people are not well educated in how to save and accumulate wealth. Imposing a UBI without financial education programs runs the risk of being ineffective and providing only short term support for those in need of it.
1.2.6.17.3.1. Con: Short term support still helps to make situations less pressing, and is generally better than offering no support, as a lack of global welfare \(even just within a country\) often does.
1.2.6.17.3.2. Con: Given a UBI is a recurring payment program it offers much more than short-term support and instead allows people to learn how to manage their finances over the course of their lifetimes.
1.2.6.17.3.3. Pro: People do not need extra money \(such as a UBI\) if they could just save money by not buying goods they do not need. This decision-making comes with education.
1.2.6.18. Con: Overcoming shortcomings in certain areas, like infrastructure, is still a responsibility of the government regardless of whether a UBI is implemented.
1.2.7. Pro: In 2015 13.5% of the U.S. population lived in poverty \([U.S. Census](http://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/p60/256/pov_table3.xls)\). This shows that currently existing welfare programs are not doing enough.
1.2.7.1. Con: Welfare programs are not intended to provide more than basic needs.
1.2.7.2. Con: The fact that current welfare programs are \(supposedly\) inefficient does not mean that a UBI would be more efficient.
1.2.7.3. Con: The fact that poverty still exists does not mean that existing welfare programs are ineffective. This is somewhat similar to saying that laws against murder "are not doing enough" since some murder still occurs.
1.2.7.4. Con: Poverty rates were declining decade over decade before the expansion of social welfare spending. Since the creation of the welfare state and its associated safety nets, poverty rates have ceased to decline in the US. This suggests that welfare has a harmful effect on poverty rates, and the answer is to provide less of it, not double down with a UBI. [Poverty rates - 1950 to 2015](http://granitegrok.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/failed-war-on-poverty.jpg)
1.2.7.5. Pro: Universal Basic Income is an important step towards eradicating World Poverty. People are poor not by choice. For example, people born into poverty, unable to find jobs, disabled & unable to work, etc., who therefore have no income or means of survival. On the other hand, there are those born with silver spoons in their mouths living in opulence without the need to work for an income. This is obviously "fated" and beyond the individual's control; "fate" has obviously not been fair. Needs action.
1.2.8. Pro: '[Workfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workfare)' programs require people to participate in cheap labour or volunteer work, as those who are unable to participate due to mental or physical disability often have their [welfare payments cut](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/disabled-people-left-behind-equality-and-human-rights-commission_uk_58dab203e4b0cb23e65be5f2).
1.2.8.1. Pro: "Workfare" programs are also problematic because they allow businesses and organizations who can benefit from them to either cut paid work positions, or in the case of organizations which \(would otherwise\) employ volunteers, leads to them being overstaffed with people who would rather not be there, reducing opportunities to contribute for and pushing aside people who may genuinely want to volunteer there.
1.2.8.2. Con: Here in Canada people with disabilities get Disability Support. In Ontario here it's called Ontario Disability Support Program \(ODSP\) with monthly amounts already higher than welfare b/c disabled persons can't work, welfare folk can. And I know the US has Disability Support as well. [mcss.gov.on.ca](https://www.mcss.gov.on.ca/en/mcss/programs/social/odsp/)
1.2.9. Pro: Low-income government-[subsidized housing](http://www.urbancure.org/washington/article.asp?id=563&t=Government-housing-is-a-bad-idea) often leaves at-risks families no choice but to reside in crime-stricken 'pre-existing ghettos', which puts their safety and livelihood at higher risk. With a UBI, families will have a choice of where they choose to reside.
1.2.9.1. Con: UBI would most likely not be high enough to afford an opportunity to relocate to any chosen housing. Even if it were, then if all residents in such a community receive UBI, then all have equal opportunity to leave. Because the demand to relocate increases, so does the cost, and the opportunity to relocate decreases.
1.2.10. Pro: Current welfare schemes are inefficient at calculating and tracking benefits disbursement, resulting in double spending and wasted costs. A UBI represents a much more certain and definite cost increase for the government, as opposed to the probabilistically lower costs of welfare.
1.2.11. Con: A UBI encourages spending on unnecessary or luxury goods on the taxpayers' dime, something which a significant number of people would likely disapprove of.
1.2.11.1. Pro: Citizens consent to a means-tested social safety net with welfare programs in a way they do not with a UBI.
1.2.11.1.1. Con: Individual citizens have little to no say or control over whether there is a social safety net, or how it is structured. It is unclear how or why they can be considered to give more meaningful consent to one that is structured as a restrictive and limited insurance scheme, versus one that is structured as a universal minimum guarantee.
1.2.11.1.1.1. Con: Citizens have some degree of control over what sorts of social safety nets they want, through voting in politicians that advocate for the welfare structure they approve of.
1.2.11.1.2. Pro: Governments always have a mandate to provide a basic social safety net, because basic rights \(e.g. food, housing, education\) are a fundamental part of the social contract.
1.2.11.1.2.1. Pro: Welfare policies such as food stamps [have proven](http://www.vox.com/2016/7/16/11948800/robert-greenstein-basic-income) to be incredibly resilient, because they are fundamentally uncontroversial.
1.2.11.2. Con: In as much as a UBI encourages spending on unnecessary goods, this is also true of most existing welfare programs as they are predominantly cash transfers of a roughly similar amount.
1.2.11.3. Con: UBI might encourage spending more on luxuries but, someone has to make those luxuries hence providing economic growth and more jobs.
1.2.11.3.1. Con: That seeming "economic growth" is just the result of bad accounting/math. At some level, this "extra spending" comes from taxing someone who would have spent or invested that money elsewhere \(or by printing more money, increasing inflation/debt, which harms the economy\).
1.2.11.4. Con: [Statistics indicate](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/12/this-chart-blows-up-the-myth-of-the-welfare-queen/282452/) that this is simply not true. Families on some form of public assistance usually spend only a small portion of their money on luxuries, and it is reasonable to assume they'd do the same with a UBI.
1.2.11.4.1. Con: The cited statistics do not make it clear what is defined as "luxuries" or how persons are determined as belonging to the  "Public Assistance" category. As such it is difficult to evaluate what proportion of money is strictly spent on essentials.
1.2.11.5. Con: Some luxury spending is important to maintaining a happy and healthy life. [Drug use](http://www.dualdiagnosis.org/drug-addiction/economic-status/) often arises when individuals become so depressed and hopeless that they feel they have no other option. A moderate amount of luxury spending could offset a far greater problem.
1.2.11.6. Con: A UBI offers basic income for basic living. An individual would need to work in order to afford more than that - and do a significant amount of work in order to have sufficient for luxuries.
1.2.11.7. Pro: For example, Swiss voters [overwhelmingly voted against](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36454060) a proposed UBI.
1.2.11.7.1. Con: The unpopularity in one country does not prove people would be more likely to spend money on luxury items.
1.2.12. Con: In some countries, governments guarantee a percentage of their salary to people who have been fired from their job. Often, that is a rate that would far exceed that of a UBI. This gives unemployed people of all incomes enough of a buffer to handle jobless periods.
1.2.12.1. Con: The duration of these guaranteed salaries is limited. A UBI would provide a source of income indefinitely.
1.2.12.1.1. Pro: Most targeted unemployment benefits have time limitations. Across Europe, only Belgium guarantees unlimited unemployment benefits. In other countries the benefits last from 3 to 24 months for a worker with 22 years of contributions \([European Commission, pg. 5](http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/themes/2015/unemployment_benefits_20151126.pdf)\).
1.2.12.2. Pro: [In Germany](https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/germany/working/unemployment/unemployment-benefits) the government guarantees 60% of their salary to fired people.
1.2.12.2.1. Con: However the high percentage of the former salary is only provided for some months. Afterwards the affected individuals experience a significant downgrade in payments.
1.2.12.3. Con: These programs operate like an insurance scheme - people must have been earning a salary in the first place, and thus contributing to taxation.
1.2.12.4. Pro: Unemployment [programs](http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/themes/2015/unemployment_benefits_20151126.pdf) in European countries offer around [75 percent](http://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-page/official-issues/benefits/unemployment-benefit/requirements) of their last earned income rate for 1 to 2 years.
1.2.12.5. Con: This is only true for people who meet certain criteria, such as having officially worked at least 6 months out of the last 12 or having worked at their last job for at least 3 years. Also: these benefits are usually cut off the second this person accepts a job - any job, even one that pays 10 times less than the "poverty line".
1.2.13. Con: This is true only when talking about relative numbers, however it's the total cost of UBI that needs to be compared because \(as not everyone receives social welfare\) it is likely to represent much more spending overall.
1.2.13.1. Con: Since the money is transferred from tax payers directly back to them, it's not a question of "spending" but a question of wealth distribution. The question here is whether the amount of bureaucracy and case-handling will be larger or smaller.
1.2.13.1.1. Pro: Indeed, we tend to always see things under the perspective of "we're going to pay more taxes" when in truth, if everyone received a basic income thanks to these taxes, then it would only actually cost money to the wealthiest, who would give more than they'd receive. The thing to determine would be the exact balance between sums paid as taxes by each population category, and sums received by same categories. Or in other words, the exact amount of wealth distribution.
1.2.13.2. Pro: A UBI will eventually come from tax money. Our tax system have two goals, one is to provide public services, another is for redistribution. A UBI serves as a means of redistribution, then debating merely of its cost provide little value. It is merely a redistribution of wealth rather than spending.
1.2.13.2.1. Pro: Fairer distribution of wealth has shown to boost economic by increased domestic spending. [Better Economic Growth When Wealth Distributed Towards the Poor](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/04/better-economic-growth-when-wealth-distributed-to-poor-instead-of-rich)
1.2.13.3. Con: Because of increased job satisfaction, workers go on sick-leave less often and are more likely to work more hours or until a later age. This will increase tax payer spending and wealth, which will feed back into the system and possibly mitigate part if not all of the increased spending.
1.2.13.4. Pro: A UBI's effectiveness would vary depending on the specific nation's economic and social needs, and would not be a reliable long term means of a citizen's well-being.
1.2.13.5. Pro: A large part of the UBI money will go to people who are not in financial need. So it's hardly efficient.
1.2.14. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.
1.2.15. Con: According to the vast majority of experts, [replacing current welfare programs with UBI is a bad idea](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/universal-basic-income).
1.2.15.1. Con: This is a very biased survey, proposing to replace several essential services and valuable subsidies with a very low UBI. Many people who support UBI as a concept would vote against this particular proposal.
1.2.15.1.1. Con: The "very low UBI" in the proposal was roughly $13,000 per person. Across the entire United States \(assuming roughly 250M eligible recipients\), this would cost over $3,000,000,000,000 \($3 trillion\). 
If $13,000 is too low, it does not seem that anything "sufficient" would be affordable, as discussed by this [super-con.](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1634.1473)
1.2.15.2. Con: Policy effectiveness is a not a matter of voting. We rely on similar examples and previous studies to gauge the potential effects of new policies.
1.2.15.3. Con: This statement is misleading. A more accurate statement would read "A handful of experts don't agree that this particular version of a UBI would be successful."
1.2.15.4. Con: The thesis proposed in the survey tied UBI with elimination of basic public health insurance in the US. Health insurance is not a welfare program.
1.2.15.5. Con: This links to a relatively small panel of economists, not a sampling of all relevant experts across disciplines, making the wording of this claim highly misleading.
1.2.16. Pro: UBI is inevitable if modern society still believes its citizens have a right, at some point in their lifetime, to affect some form of 'retirement'. As people live longer and birth rates fall, social care in old age must change and we cannot expect falling numbers of contributors to finance increasing numbers of beneficiaries.
1.2.16.1. Con: Social Security already discourages saving for retirement. Enacting an even more expensive UBI makes retirement self sufficiency even more difficult and less incentivized.
1.2.16.1.1. Con: Nobody is "self sufficient" \(short of someone living in the wilds\), it's just a question of how any given individual depends on society.
1.2.16.2. Con: Retirement on other taxpayers' expense is not a right in itself. This is just something the wealthiest of societies have been able to afford for a brief period in history, namely the decades of post-WW2 economic growth and favourable demographic conditions. Although nice to have, a universal pension system has not proved its sustainability outside of perfect conditions.
1.2.16.3. Pro: If the life expectancy [keeps going up](http://emfsurveydallas.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/North-American-Life-Expectancy-Chart.jpg), companies let go of workers past a certain age \(see [IBM](http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_31771722/ibm-boulder-job-cuts-targeted-older-workers)\), social security runs out, and care-taking and medical expenses go up after retiring, then a UBI could be a viable option to assist seniors.
1.2.16.4. Con: If people are living longer, they will be able to work longer. Thus, they will not need a UBI to support them, as a job can.
1.2.16.4.1. Pro: This is especially true, since seniors can now pick up work-at-home and computer jobs \(compared to the hard-labor, industrial jobs of the past\).
1.2.16.4.2. Con: People do not always retain sufficient health to work full-time in their later years.
1.2.17. Pro: Employers will no longer be forced to play the role of social security guarantors. Employing will be easier, cheaper and therefore more accessible.
1.2.18. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.
1.2.19. Pro: Welfare programs are conditional in ways that are unfair and place unreasonable expectations and burdens on the poor they seek to help.
1.2.19.1. Pro: UBI provides a delivery mode that can provide money to those who cannot easily access jobs \(such as disabled or rural individuals\).
1.2.19.2. Con: Conditions such as demonstrating a willingness to seek a job in order to receive unemployment benefits seem fair and socially useful.
1.2.19.3. Pro: These conditions can include urine drug testing to access welfare checks or weekly unscheduled visits at the homes of welfare recipients.
1.2.19.3.1. Con: No explanation has been offered as to why this is "unfair" or "unreasonable"; on the contrary, many people would consider it reasonable \(at least on the surface\) that one must undergo periodic drug tests in order to receive government support.
1.2.19.4. Pro: Governments are bad at determining these conditions because the most wealthy in society hold the levers of power, thus they lacks empathy with those in positions of least influence in society.
1.2.19.4.1. Con: Governments are accountable to the majority democratically. Recent US election results suggest that the [working class](https://newrepublic.com/article/138754/blame-trumps-victory-college-educated-whites-not-working-class) have considerable voting power to hold elites to account.
1.2.19.4.1.1. Con: Many voices are part of minorities \(e.g. poor Black people\) that do not belong to the majority of working class.
1.2.19.4.1.2. Con: Governmental representatives have already shown that they are willing to disregard the voice of the majority in order to pursue their own interests. \(e.g. [Ajit Pai ignores outcry from all sides](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/07/net-neutrality-fcc-ajit-pai)\)
1.2.19.5. Con: Many targeted welfare programs provide certain necessary goods \(food, medicines, education supplies\), unlike a UBI that will provide only money and will increase the number of things poor people need to worry about.
1.2.19.5.1. Con: Many welfare programs also offer cash that the recipients need to worry about distributing.
1.2.19.5.2. Pro: Poor people might experience anxiety from the necessity of managing money by themselves, as they were used to have a government providing goods for them.
1.2.19.5.2.1. Con: This is the same situation they'll be in when paid a wage.
1.2.19.5.2.1.1. Con: Even when being paid a wage the people may still be receiving some government benefits \(e.g. medicare\) that take some of the burden of budgetary planning off of the poor people's shoulders.
1.2.19.5.2.1.2. Con: Someone who is being paid a wage can be expected on average to be more fiscally/personally responsible than someone who is unable or \(perhaps temporarily\) unwilling to get a job. For example, someone may not be able to get a wage because they suffer from mental health issues—mental health issues which also may prevent them from budgeting well.
1.2.19.5.3. Con: Families know better than the state in which areas they need to spend, and in which they need to spend less.
1.2.19.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.17.2.4.1.1.
1.2.19.5.3.2. Con: The parent claim does not offer any empirical studies to support what it is claiming.
1.2.20. Pro: UBI is better than other ideas to improve economic conditions targeted for everyone, such as guaranteed jobs \([1](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/us/politics/democrats-guaranteed-jobs.html), [2](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/guaranteed-jobs-may-not-solve-the-democrats-bigger-problem-with-many-voters/)\).
1.2.21. Pro: A UBI is portable \(especially with technology that allows benefits to travel with a person\), as welfare programs usually have a permanent location that a person needs to travel to in order to receive assistance.
1.2.21.1. Pro: A UBI helps people who move a lot, as those people would not need to keep finding new centers to receive the same benefits as before the person moved.
1.2.22. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.
1.2.23. Pro: A UBI affords choice and agency to individuals to make economic decisions that targeted welfare programs cannot.
1.2.23.1. Con: Choices can be facilitated in a variety of other ways. For instance [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_voucher) and [housing](http://www.cbpp.org/research/housing/policy-basics-the-housing-choice-voucher-program) vouchers can be used to increase the choices between government services for poor individuals.
1.2.23.1.1. Con: Vouchers still limit choices to government approved options and make assumptions about how much people should and will spend on specific things. In this sense, a UBI provides a higher level of agency or accounting for relative differences in expenditures based on circumstance.
1.2.23.1.2. Con: The most direct and efficient method of facilitating choices in a society is through a common currency exchanged for goods and services within a free market environment.
1.2.23.2. Con: Government has greater access to research institutions and therefore macro-level information. This can be used to manage inter-generational dynamics better than an individual is able to.
1.2.23.2.1. Pro: For instance, moving young children into better areas has little effect on their parents, but massively improves their [expected earnings](http://scholar.harvard.edu/hendren/publications/effects-exposure-better-neighborhoods-children-new-evidence-moving-opportunity). Thus parents may be reluctant to move without information about how their futures will be affected, which governments are better placed to access.
1.2.23.2.2. Con: Macro-level information is useful for setting macro-level policy that impacts numerous groups. Less so for micro-level decision making where individual circumstance and chance play a massive role in resource distribution.
1.2.23.2.3. Con: Macro-level information is costly to collect and often out of date as soon as it is made available.
1.2.23.3. Con: It is disingenuous to claim that money is equivalent to choices. Behavioural evidence shows that people tend to be risk loving, discount expected losses, and are [unable to conceptualise distant future benefits](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/book-review-poor-economics/). Often this results in people wasting money on unwise purchases.
1.2.23.3.1. Con: Money is equivalent to choice, as in many cases people can purchase goods or services that actually influence their own future choices towards wise outcomes. For example, the wealthy spend a lot of money purchasing [commitment devices](http://messymatters.com/akrasia/) that enable or incentivise self-control, such as medical insurance or a personal trainer.
1.2.23.3.2. Pro: People treat losses as less likely to affect them adversely than they actually are. This is why people drive drunk and choose not to wear seatbelts, when the rational choice is to do neither of these things.
1.2.23.3.2.1. Con: This is highly subjective. There is no actual evidence suggesting most people would take those risks.
1.2.23.3.3. Con: This is more likely to happen in situations where people are encouraged to think short term, and have no stability. People are more likely to consider long term impacts when they know their basic needs will be provided for as long as they make wise decisions.
1.2.23.3.4. Con: The behavioral evidence cited above has been contradicted numerous times, including in the science study referenced in [this](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/11/your-brain-on-poverty-why-poor-people-seem-to-make-bad-decisions/281780/) article, which notes that poverty and the lack of stability causes bad decision making rather than it being an innate characteristic.
1.2.23.3.5. Con: Money enables individuals to invest in education. Education extends occupational possibilities and choices.
1.2.23.4. Pro: Targeted programs are inherently paternalistic, insofar as they assume that the government is better suited than the disadvantaged themselves at making decisions benefiting their well-being.
1.2.23.4.1. Con: Most targeted programs only make minimal assumptions about the needs and desires of the disadvantaged: they provide things such as money, food, and childcare that are of universal value.
1.2.23.4.2. Pro: Welfare programs provide benefits designed for the average person who uses welfare. Most people do not reflect the average and have diverse needs, so their diverse needs can be better met by individuals making their own choices.
1.2.23.4.2.1. Con: Most welfare programs, as a baseline, provide money to those in need. Money can be used by people to purchase what they need, regardless of what those needs are.
1.2.23.4.2.1.1. Con: Some cash grants are not equivalent to a complete unconditional cash grant that offers full agency to those making decisions and not just partial agency.
1.2.23.4.2.2. Pro: A UBI helps decentralise the management of funds by allowing more local involvement in the process.
1.2.23.4.3. Pro: People are best at making economic decisions for themselves, as they know their own needs and circumstances and can thus better account for where to direct money.
1.2.23.4.3.1. Con: Dominant members of households can misuse UBI payments to further their own needs instead of providing for their families.
1.2.23.4.3.1.1. Con: This problem can apply to any family with capital of any kind.
1.2.23.4.3.1.2. Con: Considering everyone would be receiving the same UBI, it would be difficult for any individual in a family to totally abuse their power and waste money in a way that wouldn't be obvious to other members of their family.
1.2.23.4.3.1.2.1. Pro: With a UBI, women will have their own money and no longer be completely dependent on their partner's salary.
1.2.23.4.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Women are adults, if they are dependent on anyone's salary that was a mistake they made. Why should society have the pay for an individual's poor choice?
1.2.23.4.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Many women were forced to make that decision before they were adults. Other women were encouraged or even coerced by society and even their families to make this decision regardless of their desires. An UBI would give these women the opportunity to reverse those circumstances that were forced upon them.
1.2.23.4.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Society is not obligated to pay for the mistakes of an individual, but it is certainly morally virtuous for society to do so. As with any other morally virtuous thing, it should be encouraged.
1.2.23.4.3.1.3. Con: The same is possible with welfare checks.
1.2.23.4.3.1.4. Pro: Comparatively, income is less accountable than conditional grants or particular items.
1.2.23.4.3.1.5. Pro: [Analysis of Canadian expenditure surveys](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0335.00148/abstract) found that the gender of the recipient of a marginal increase in income predicted whether or not that income would be used to finance child care. This suggests that women should be targeted with grants to more efficiently improve social welfare, rather than everyone receiving equal incomes.
1.2.23.4.3.1.5.1. Con: The analysis is made with data from 1992, it is possible those gendered divisions have changed after more than 20 years.
1.2.23.4.3.1.5.2. Pro: In the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme \(NREGS\) in India female [NREGS](http://www.usc.es/economet/journals1/aeid/aeid14213.pdf) income goes towards children, while male income does not \(at least in the proposed categories, i.e. clothing and footwear\).
1.2.23.4.3.1.6. Pro: Often income would go into a shared bank account for a couple living together. Targeted welfare can often much more easily reach women or children directly.
1.2.23.4.3.2. Con: People tend to underestimate their future needs and often struggle to plan ahead. This is especially true when it comes to saving for future health problems because people often do not take seriously the possibility that they will be affected.
1.2.23.4.3.2.1. Con: National health care will still exist under a UBI model.
1.2.23.4.3.3. Pro: The needs of people are not static and there are unexpected costs that occur \(e.g. fees for a child's school trip\). Allowing people themselves to account for these changes is better.
1.2.23.4.3.4. Con: Targeted welfare, such as providing conditional or item-specific benefits, is not mutually exclusive to the poor also receiving cash grants.
1.2.23.4.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.23.4.2.1.1.
1.2.23.4.3.5. Con: It is very easy for the government to analyse consumption patterns and account for seasonal changes.
1.2.23.4.3.5.1. Con: This kind of research is useful for analyzing broad trends, but it is inadequate to address different families with different circumstances and challenges.
1.2.23.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.9.1.
1.2.23.6. Pro: Welfare is only focused on "current state"  problems and that you must be in a "pit" that requires "assistance". A UBI is whole-life, and allows equal opportunities to make decisions that can help you plan, such as continuing education to ensure your skill set is current or providing the security to end an unhealthy relationship that you stay in for financial reasons.
1.2.23.7. Pro: In order for a state to provide housing, education and food for everyone, there would be needed a partly socialistic system, which althrough the history has been proven to not work. On the other hand, a state that supports private industries to help people with food, housing and education would be more viable.
1.2.23.8. Con: UBI will dismantle not-for-profit essential welfare infrastructure eg: public food storage & distribution. This will lead to conflict and strife during times of shortage and waste in times of plenty.
1.2.23.8.1. Con: People freed from the requirement of performing paid work \(or provided with additional income\) by the existence of a UBI may - and many likely will - choose to devote their time and/or spare finances to altruistic or charitable projects, bolstering not-for-profit services.
1.2.23.9. Pro: A UBI shifts purchasing power from government to individuals thereby incentivizing what people actually want rather than what the majority wants them to want.
1.2.23.10. Con: UBI can be misused by lower income population due to lack of expertise in household financial management.
1.2.23.11. Con: This also affords UBI recipients the ability to exhaust their entire income on addictive substances \(sugary foods, alcohol, drugs, etc.\) which is why no one supports a full replacement of all social programs with UBI. There is no evidence that I am aware of that suggests that human beings make rational decisions when their incomes rise.
1.2.24. Con: A UBI will logically render void current welfare programs, and when people complain that they need more help, new welfare programs will be set up and will raise costs for taxpayers.
1.2.24.1. Con: This claim implies people should be ignored when they express a need for help, in the interests of retaining taxpayers' money, rather than the claims being investigated for veracity, and actioned if substantiated. The latter, not the former, is the way a humane society should operate. Taxpayers must accept that taxes are part of what maintains the foundation of the society they live in.
1.2.24.2. Pro: In [Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-basic-income-pilot) a UBI pilot in a couple of located was recently terminated. It paid $17,000, and all existing supports remained in place. The cost would have been catastrophic for the provincial finances were it extended to all locations and made permanent.
1.2.25. Pro: A UBI would provide the threshold for all citizens of a nation. It would put the necessities for life of every citizen above the greed of the rich. Once all citizens are cared for, any excess can be fought over by whomever wants more than the basics.
1.2.26. Pro: A UBI allows labour to be more effectively allocated in the economy.
1.2.26.1. Pro: A UBI prevents people from self-development because it unconditional nature means it can't stipulate conditions \(such as job-seeking\) or provide incentives \(such as for retraining\). This means the labour market becomes less adaptive and flexible.
1.2.26.1.1. Con: This assumes that people's only motivation for self-development is to gain money. Humans seek growth and improvement with or without government manipulation for other reasons as well, such as for personal satisfaction or social status.
1.2.26.1.1.1. Con: This assumes that these self improvements will be beneficial to society, [when 60-70% of younger generations](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/well/family/is-your-child-a-phone-addict.html) are addicted to mobile devices and social networks. There is no reason to believe the statistics will improve, as social network addiction is claimed to be stronger than cocaine addiction.
1.2.26.1.2. Con: Working in a job that one hates, for very little pay, is not self-development. It actually traps them in a perpetual state of none-development.
1.2.26.1.2.1. Pro: Stress \(such as from a hated job or excessive hours\) can take time away from self-development, and force people to use all their spare time in attempting to survive and recover and/or escapism. The related exhaustion can also prevent them from thinking in the long term, beyond the immediate moment.
1.2.26.1.3. Con: The theory of self-determinism suggests humans have a need for competence in a skill or skills. A UBI would offer the opportunity to focus on competence rather than acquiring a basic level of income.
1.2.26.2. Con: Universal welfare would decrease the incentive to stay on top of changing market conditions and develop the skills and personal savings needed to stay productive and self-sufficient, because the guaranteed income provides a fallback option in the event that one becomes unemployed and financially depleted.
1.2.26.2.1. Con: This claim is only true if people are happy to take a hit in their standards of living due to not earning additional money.
1.2.26.3. Pro: A UBI will allow for a freer form of working where people can take jobs and pursue projects more directly related to their skills, while still having a stable standard of living while they wait on the fruit of their collective labors.
1.2.26.3.1. Con: If necessity is the mother of innovation, a lack of need may inhibit innovation by depressing motivation.
1.2.26.3.1.1. Con: The necessity there referenced is a task that is undoable, or needs to be done better, not a lack of means in general. For example, projecting ones voice thousands of miles almost instantaneously was impossible before the invention of the telephone, and being able to eat won't make working in the dark easier, but a light-bulb will.
1.2.26.3.1.2. Con: Or it may create the free time for a motivation or inspiration which would otherwise be repressed and ignored until it fades \(due to higher - or higher-seeming - priorities\) to instead be pursued.
1.2.26.3.1.3. Con: The need for food and shelter is only one need that might spur innovation. Other needs would arise when this most basic need is removed and hence spur wider innovation.
1.2.26.3.1.4. Con: Innovation is not necessarily an inherent good. Other goods may be preferred to an increase in innovation, such as a decrease in poverty, inequality, suffering, etc.
1.2.26.3.2. Con: This outcome can be achieved with a more traditional unemployment insurance scheme.
1.2.26.3.2.1. Con: Not all types of work are covered by these schemes — non-traditional pursuits in music, writing and art do not have a quantifiable average income which can be addressed.
1.2.26.3.2.2. Con: A traditional unemployment insurance scheme loses many people through the cracks but is also easily exploitable.
1.2.26.3.2.2.1. Pro: Furthermore, it only saves people from the stress of poverty after poverty is already present. Economic stress produces compiled anxiety in a household due to education costs and requirement for more loans and credit.
1.2.26.3.3. Pro: Without the burden of basic material survival, individuals have more time and energy to consider the wider issues relating to their jobs. This tends to lead to innovation, as well new possibilities. Freedom from material want allows space for perspectives to change in such a way that benefits society as a whole.
1.2.26.3.3.1. Pro: UBI would foster innovation by freeing people from toiling to meet basic needs.
1.2.26.3.3.2. Pro: One of the first thing large companies do for desirable employees is take money off the table by providing them with an income that allows them to be free from worry in order to pursue the objectives of their jobs. By expanding this to the general public, and taking away the worry of basic housing and nutrition, it allows for creativity and realization of potential. Most people will get bored of sitting around and doing nothing.
1.2.26.3.3.2.1. Pro: Universal Basic Income merely is Capitalism that doesn't start at zero dollars. It starts with food, shelter, and health.
1.2.26.3.4. Pro: Put another way it's [Seneca's barbell](https://plasubtil.wordpress.com/2014/07/23/antifragile-chapter-ten-seneca/) strategy. UBI's the cost of an option that protects from the downside of extreme harm \(the absorbing barrier of destitution\) and so affords the freedom \(survival and time\) to engage in activities that may bring upside to do more than merely survive. Conceived this way, you set a level that allows not only for the basics of healthcare, shelter, and food; but is additionally structured for the skills acquisition that upside depends on. Redundancy? Absolutely.
1.2.26.3.5. Pro: A UBI promotes a more motivated, productive workforce in employees free to choose work according to their talents, interest, or prospective benefits rather than taking something just to survive.
1.2.26.3.6. Pro: A UBI affords people time and financial freedom to diversify their skill set.
1.2.26.3.6.1. Pro: UBI allows young incoming workers to the economy the time and money to first figure out what they truly love to do and are gifted at so, when they do enter the workforce, they are happier and much more productive over their 40-plus years of employment.
1.2.26.3.6.2. Con: Some people will not use this time to diversify their skill set.
1.2.26.3.6.2.1. Con: It is up to each individual to choose, whether or not they want to work more, educate themselves or to do other things. It is the same today: some people work, some study, and \(like it or not\) some stay home on a welfare program.
1.2.26.3.6.2.2. Con: Some people may not use this time to diversify their skill-set, however, it is unclear whether it will be a significant percentage, enough to negate the benefits of those who would.
1.2.26.3.6.3. Con: Such extra skills will be worthless if people do not apply them \(on a job\).
1.2.26.3.6.3.1. Con: This assumes that the only things that add worth to society are jobs. Volunteers in many fields seem to disprove this.
1.2.26.3.6.3.1.1. Con: This discussion is about the economy. Volunteers may do a lot of good, but jobs do the most for economic growth.
1.2.26.3.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Our economy is driven by people working: people can't afford not too. Thus while jobs are the engine of the current economy, that doesn't speak to the possibility of an alternate economic system in which volunteer work forms the basis of work.
1.2.26.3.6.3.2. Con: In a time of exponential technology growth, it is unpredictable what jobs will exist in the future.  As people explore their previously-untapped skills \(such as creativity\), they could very well invent a job that's needed, rather than waiting for a government or corporation to discover that need.
1.2.26.3.6.3.3. Con: A "skill" that provides recreation has the benefit of increasing morale regardless of whether it provides an economic benefit or not.
1.2.26.3.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.
1.2.26.3.6.5. Pro: A UBI can allow people to pursue safer jobs \(they can avoid resorting to low-paid, unsafe ones due to a lack of money\), while allowing industries can automate [unsafe jobs](https://www.robotics.org/blog-article.cfm/Dangerous-Robot-Jobs/15) without impacting people's livelihood.
1.2.27. Con: A UBI means that any other welfare schemes that could help individuals with specific needs are either cut to fund the UBI, or become unpopular because the UBI will squander political capital and public goodwill. If the government truly cares for those in special need, it would support means-tested, targeted welfare over a UBI.
1.2.27.1. Con: With a UBI, the pressure on other social welfare programs is drastically decreased. In the US, the costs of social security, unemployment benefits, medicare and health rebates, and food entitlements [are approximately $2.2 trillion dollars](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/). Cutting these programs would become feasible under a UBI, where it would replace most entitlement systems.
1.2.27.1.1. Pro: Even moderate reductions would provide feasibly close to one trillion dollars of freed government revenue.
1.2.27.1.1.1. Con: This would not be "new" government revenue; the "reductions" in traditional welfare program would be eclipsed by increases in spending on UBI.
1.2.27.1.2. Con: Without medicare, many low-income families would burn through their UBI very quickly, unless there's a medical system such as Canada has in place.
1.2.27.1.3. Con: If a $10,000/year UBI were enacted in the US, the total costs would be roughly around $2.5-3.5 trillion dollars \(depending on who receives benefits\). Thus, even if the traditional welfare programs were somehow fully cut, this would still represent an increase in overall spending by hundreds of billions of dollars.
1.2.27.1.3.1. Con: This [ignores the fact](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/why-we-should-all-have-a-basic-income/) that a UBI would also be implemented as a net transfer system: "In the same way it does not cost $20 to give someone $20 in exchange for $10, it does not cost $3 trillion to give every adult citizen $12,000 and every child $4,000, when every household will be paying varying amounts of taxes in exchange for their UBI. Instead it will cost around 30% of that, or about $900 billion."
1.2.27.1.3.1.1. Pro: $900 billion would be relatively easily accommodated through tiny tax rates increases \(5% for an extra $300b\) while also eliminating 25% of defence spending \($215b\), wage subsidies \($72b\), the home mortgage interest deduction \($70b\), and social security \($220b\).
1.2.27.1.3.1.1.1. Con: It is highly unlikely that there would be a 25% cut to military spending anytime soon.
1.2.27.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: There are already people who are significantly dissatisfied with the amount of military spending, and advocate for a reduction in it.
1.2.27.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It does not matter what a few people think; people have always wanted to cut the military spending. In the end, a 25% reduction seems highly unrealistic.
1.2.27.1.3.1.1.2. Con: 2017 tax revenues are $3.3 trillion, $300 billion is 9% of that, tax rate would have to be increased by 9%, which is nearly double the "tiny" 5% suggested, the math is off. Also, I'm not sure where these numbers came from defense spending is $590B, and Social Security is $939B, 25% of each is $148B and $235B respectively, $383B total, compared to the $435B for those two that's specified, this is off by more than $50B! Please link a source...[Budget Data](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2019-BUD/pdf/BUDGET-2019-BUD-24.pdf)
1.2.27.1.3.1.2. Con: "Net transfer" systems lose efficiency when the people who create value \(and subsequently earn money\) are taxed to cover for those who do not or cannot. Otherwise, deep/extreme socialism could solve all of our inequity and inefficiency problems. Traditional, means-tested welfare systems, while imperfect, can strike the proper balance of redistribution.
1.2.27.1.3.1.3. Con: This ignores the fact that taxes would still have to be raised \(or other programs cut\) in order to afford this program. Many people might end up getting more money than they have to pay in new taxes, but overall taxation would have to increase by at least however much money is provided through the UBI.
1.2.27.1.3.1.3.1. Con: It doesn't matter if the taxes are higher, when you are given the money to pay those higher taxes up-front.
1.2.27.1.3.1.4. Con: The US population is estimated at 252 million adults, and 74 million persons under age 18. At the levels you suggest that would require tax revenues of $3.3 trillion, even if you then redistribute that. Current US revenues are about $3.3 trillion, so you're talking about doubling the current US tax rates.[Federal Budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#/media/File:CBO_Infographic_2017.png) [Population Data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217)
1.2.27.1.3.1.5. Con: While it doesn't cost $20 to give someone $20 in exchange for $10, you still have to have the $20 to start with. You'd still have to collect the full $3.3 trillion. If you're arguing for negative income tax, I suggest you tack on to one of the already existing claims for that.
1.2.27.1.3.1.6. Pro: If we assume UBI level is $12000, and it's a negative income tax, and if you make more than $12000, you get nothing. Then the whole program would require extra revenues in the US of about $600B. [Income Data](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/pinc-01/2018/pinc01_1_1_1.xls)
1.2.27.1.3.1.6.1. Con: $12000, is well below the US poverty line of $22500. At that level it would cost $1.6 trillion, and this argument is under the claim, "UBI's that meet the proverty line are too expensive for governments to afford". At some point, yes you can lower the number enough that some\(not all\) people won't argue with you about the funding anymore, at that point would you even be making things enough better to worry about providing the benefit.
1.2.27.1.4. Pro: In fact one of the very goals of a UBI is to obviate the need for any other social welfare programs. The saving it hopes to exploit is not just the money given to the needy in such a program but the entire overhead of delivering them \(including staff, real estate, and infrastructure\). All these savings go toward making a livable UBI feasible and attractive as an alternative to not addition to all other existing welfare programs. [Guaranteed Income as a Replacement for the Welfare State](http://www.fljs.org/files/publications/Murray.pdf)
1.2.27.2. Con: This argument supports the status quo which has demonstrably failed to help those in special need. A UBI would still allow for extra  targeted assistance for extraordinary need.
1.2.27.3. Pro: This is a concern for people currently claiming disability-related benefits in particular.
1.3. Con: UBIs that meet the poverty line are too expensive for governments to afford.
1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.3.1.2.
1.3.2. Con: Microsimulation from Barcelona University study shows that [only 3.4% of Spanish GDP](http://www.redrentabasica.org/rb/la-renta-basica-incondicional-y-como-se-puede-financiar-comentarios-a-los-amigos-y-enemigos-de-la-propuesta/) is needed to finance a sufficient UBI. This is without removing any funding for the army, health or education.
1.3.2.1. Con: Microsimulations cannot credibly simulate the effects of a nationwide UBI. Criticisms of UBI tend to center around its macroeconomic effects, which microsimulations do not address.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Macroeconomic study shows that UBI would grow the economy. [rooseveltinstitute.org](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/modeling-macroeconomic-effects-ubi/)
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The study seems to improperly estimate investment and loan effects. That is to say: the study claims overall economic activity would increase because the proposal would be funded largely by taxes on the higher-income population, which the study states tend to save a higher proportion of their money. However, a decrease in savings decreases the ability to invest/acquire loans \(contrary to its assumption that "Generally, investment is determined by the level of economic activity"\).
1.3.2.1.1.2. Con: The study does not seem to account for decreased-incentive effects. That is to say, the study proposes a policy of higher taxes on the rich, but does not account for whether this might discourage the rich from working as much, offering as many investments/loans, and/or expanding their business.
1.3.2.1.1.3. Con: The study assumes that inflation will not significantly be affected by this change in the economy, even though it just seems that more people are spending, rather than the money being used more efficiently.
1.3.2.2. Con: Given Spain's GDP of [$1.2 Trillion \(USD\)](https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/gdp) and a population of 46.4 million, 3.4% of GDP equates to a UBI of only $879 per person.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Even assuming that $879/year in Spain equates to roughly $1160/year in the USA—since the cost of living in Spain is roughly 32% lower \(as suggested by [this site](http://www.mylifeelsewhere.com/cost-of-living/united-states/spain)\)—this is clearly an insufficient sum for a UBI.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: Not every single person in Spain would receive a UBI; such as non-citizens or children.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: Going by Spain's standard 40 hour workweek and minimum wage of EUR 829/month, that's a yearly mandate of USD 12,173, way more than USD 879.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Con: It's not necessary to tie the minimum UBI to the minimum wage. Presumably collecting UBI costs less for the recipient than maintaining a job might cost for a worker. There's a reduction in clothing, transportation, education, childcare, etc. These necessary expenses might lead to a higher minimum wage compared to UBI.
1.3.2.3. Con: Expressing costs in terms of GDP is misleading, because GDP generally does not link well with government taxation/spending. For example, in the US, federal and total government revenue in 2016 [was estimated to be $3.27 and $6.13 trillion](https://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/federal_revenue) \(respectively\). US GDP in 2016, on the other hand, was multiple times that: [nearly $18.6 trillion](https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2017/pdf/gdp4q16_adv.pdf). Ultimately, many government programs can be made to look small when expressed in percentages of GDP, but that is misleading when talking about government spending.
1.3.2.4. Con: This 3.4% will have to be ploughed out of some other thing it has been already allocated for, and possibly allocated year on year. That departments and services that would be would suffer as a result.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: Most UBI implementations will make other benefits obsoleete. Like unemployment benefits, or multiple child monetary support.
1.3.3. Con: If it were impossible for the government to afford, [Richard Nixon wouldn't have proposed](https://www.nixonfoundation.org/2017/01/nixons-vision-for-american-governance/) one during [the 70's](https://www.nixonfoundation.org/2014/06/family-assistance-plan-families-can-succeed/); a much less prosperous time. \(It was [shot down by the left](https://thecorrespondent.com/4503/the-bizarre-tale-of-president-nixon-and-his-basic-income-bill/173117835-c34d6145) because they thought they'd reject one version to approve a more generous one later\)
1.3.3.1. Con: The fact that he proposed one does not mean it was reasonable in the long run; it would not be the first time a leader implemented a policy that would ruin their country.
1.3.3.2. Con: The "Nixon Disapproves" criterion for public policy is not always reliable.
1.3.4. Con: A UBI offsets its cost by creating wealth and increasing the amount of economic activity that states can tax.
1.3.4.1. Con: A UBI does not inherently create wealth. It merely redistributes it.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Wealth is based on value provided, so if the distribution of money sends it to a bearer for whom it has more value, then wealth is created.
1.3.4.2. Con: The degree to which it might "create wealth" to offset its costs is likely to be low/fractional. Overall, this in itself does not suggest that UBIs would actually be affordable.
1.3.4.3. Pro: The size of an economy is determined by two main factors: first, the total amount of money available. But, more importantly: the speed of monetary circulation between actors \(a factor which is commonly overlooked\). Again in a very simplified model, everyone can get rich on just $1 along as it is transferred very rapidly in exchange for goods. In fact, just handing money to people to buy things may be the best stimulus for the economy imaginable \(but cause inflation, over stimulus\).
1.3.5. Pro: For example, in the U.S. providing a UBI of $10,000 \(just below the poverty level\) to 300 million Americans would cost over $3 trillion dollars, easily [eclipsing current levels of tax revenue](http://www.cbpp.org/poverty-and-opportunity/commentary-universal-basic-income-may-sound-attractive-but-if-it-occurred).
1.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.27.1.
1.3.5.2. Con: Many UBI programs do not pay out to children. There are only about 250 million adults in the USA. Some programs only pay out to adults over 21 years of age, thereby reducing the number of benefactors to 230 million.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: In the end, this is only a small difference from the grandparent. If the UBI were $10,000 annually and there were roughly 200 million benefactors, expenses would be roughly $2 trillion—half of [current federal spending overall.](https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-government-spending-3305763)
1.3.5.3. Con: UBI could be scaled up very gradually over time. These small transfer payments would be more likely to be spent by the majority of citizens, who are lower income, creating the greatest possible economic multiplier effect for the amount of money given. When you hit the peak and the multiplier begins to diminish, you can slow down the increase in UBI levels and eventually stop the increase and hold it steady
1.3.5.3.1. Con: Any discussion of consumption multipliers must factor for how savings are [multiplied](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multipliereffect.asp) by the fractional reserve system of banking. Decreasing savings to increase consumption very reasonably may have no net-multiplier effect \(possibly even a negative multiplier effect\), and/or also may reasonably decrease the efficiency of combined consumption + investment.
1.3.5.3.2. Con: This claim merely assumes we are not already at "the peak"; the balance between savings and consumption could reasonably already be at or near equilibrium.
1.3.5.3.3. Con: This claim merely assumes we will be able to accurately determine what/where "the peak" is, but such econometric analyses are not simple when conducted across an entire economy, in which there might be recessions/booms, policy changes, disruptions, imperfect reporting, or any other sort of interference/issue.
1.3.5.4. Con: [Here is an example](https://works.bepress.com/widerquist/75/) where it would cost $539 billion. It was made by a leading figure of the Basic Income Earth Network, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
1.3.5.4.1. Con: The cited [source](http://basicincome.org/news/2017/05/much-ubi-cost/) is unreliable—even dubious.
1.3.5.4.1.1. Pro: The source makes an extremely dubious/misleading comparison between UBI and current entitlement spending. Specifically, the source says that the gross cost of a UBI program is "often-mentioned but not-very-meaningful," but in the very next part of the sentence, it compares the *net cost* of a UBI to the *gross cost* of current entitlement programs. If the source says that gross costs of a UBI aren't important, it shouldn't compare UBI's net costs to gross costs of entitlement programs.
1.3.5.4.1.2. Pro: The source itself describes its estimates as "back-of-the-envelope calculations," rather than even halfway rigorous economic models.
1.3.5.5. Con: This implies that the current taxation structure is the ideal structure. UBI allows the tax free threshold to be lowered, increasing revenue from the bottom, and a change to the tax structure for the top end of town more in line with the [New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal) could very well allow it to be sustainable.
1.3.5.5.1. Con: If the tax free threshold is lowered \(i.e. if poorer people could be taxed\) this would undermine the value of the UBI.
1.3.5.5.2. Con: If the tax free threshold were lowered, this might discourage poorer people from increasing their income \(e.g. by working\) in the same way that traditional welfare does \(to an extent\).
1.3.5.5.3. Con: This merely assumes that increasing taxes on a poorer segment of society will noticeably offset the spending increases. On the contrary, it seems unlikely that this will have significant positive effects on revenue.
1.3.5.6. Con: Providing a UBI, particularly when targeted at the consumer sector of the economy \(which traditionally has a very high multiplier effect on fiscal injections\) can also drastically improve economic performance to pay for increases in government spending.
1.3.5.6.1. Con: A UBI is not targeted toward the consumer sector of the economy; it is given to everyone equally.
1.3.5.6.1.1. Con: The vast majority of citizens are from the "consumer sector," so the program still has the highest impact on this sector.
1.3.5.6.2. Pro: Households in the US have very low rates of savings, and thus very high rates of spending. Even assuming a moderately high propensity to save, of 0.25 \(25% of every dollar of income saved\), the multiplier effect of additional money to households would sit around 3-4. The US currently collects around one quarter of GDP in the form of tax revenue, meaning that the UBI would come close to paying for itself in the form of tax revenue increases.
1.3.5.6.2.1. Con: Treating the UBI as a stimulus assumes that the poor are not already spending at similar rates through the status quo means-tested system, and any gains in pretax income given to the status quo middle class must surely be offset by any increases in the marginal tax rate that would result in this.
1.3.5.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.5.3.1.
1.3.5.6.3. Pro: Even when not directly claimed by tax revenue, increases to national wealth that come from increased economic activity justify economic policies to increase government wealth, such as international borrowing or printing new money. When these policies are implemented as the result of increased economic performance, negative side effects such as inflationary pressures and loss of credit worthiness can be avoided.
1.3.5.6.3.1. Con: This assumes that a UBI increases spending among low socio-economic status people over the current means-tested welfare system, which already provides substantial capital to this group to spend on necessities like food and shelter.
1.3.5.7. Con: The United States has already gone through many years of tax reductions, as well as reductions in government spending. Congruently with this the income disparity has skyrocketed, and many already live below the poverty line. Therefore the United States may be a bad example to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a UBI.
1.3.5.8. Con: -> See 1.2.27.1.3.1.
1.3.6. Con: Germany is the most powerful state of Europe, but it [pays a basic liveable income of 404€ /month for each unemployed person living alone](http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1111&langId=en&intPageId=4556\]).
1.3.6.1. Con: This is a form of means-tested/targeted welfare, not a UBI. If Germany had implemented a UBI, it would have to pay far more people than just "unemployed people living alone"; these new costs very well may be unaffordable.
1.3.7. Pro: For example, in Sweden \(one of the largest welfare states\) if each citizen were given a basic liveable income of 12,000€/year, the annual cost of this policy alone would be as much as the [government spends in total](http://www.government.se/articles/2016/09/the-2017-budget-in-five-minutes/). This seems unaffordable.
1.3.7.1. Con: The government could just come up with a different tax structure.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: Tax cannot be higher than GDP \(that would mean 100% tax\). Taxation in many develop countries is close to \(or even above\) 50% of GDP. So taxes could never be more than doubled. [List of tax revenue to GDP ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_to_GDP_ratio).
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: UBI doesn't have to be a new institution. It can be built into tax graduation or a "negative tax" for those who make less then UBI.
1.3.7.2. Con: It is in the largest welfare states that a UBI would be the most affordable because it would replace the already-expensive set of social services.
1.3.7.3. Con: 12,000 Euros is too high for UBI. $7,500 would be nearer the mark so 6,500 Euros or £5,500. The fact that the example states 12,000 Euros and goes on to state that this would be unaffordable is testament to the fact that it would not be set this high in the first place.
1.3.7.3.1. Con: Nordic countries, and others such as Germany, typically set some forms of unemployment benefits around [40-60% of average annual incomes](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/15/which-best-countries-live-unemployed-disabled-benefits), which would be around 12,000 Euros, meaning this figure is not wholly unprecedented or unreasonable.
1.3.7.3.1.1. Con: This figure is rather inflated. Whilst UBI means to be constant and universal, mentioned unemployment payment are limited in time. Also only those who had worked are eligible for these high benefits.
1.3.7.3.2. Con: Sure, but that argument is also a straw man in the same respect. if saying  "UBI's are not affordable because the government will set them at levels which it cannot afford" is a bad argument, then so is saying "UBI's are affordable because the government will set them at levels it can afford" We ought at least to grant the premise that the UBI in question would address the financial needs of the recipients, and proceed the debate from there.
1.3.7.3.3. Pro: Given the poverty line for a household in Sweden is 11,142€ \([half median household income](https://www.thelocal.se/20130529/48194)\) a UBI set at 6,000€ would be enough to ensure a household of two people is not in poverty.
1.3.7.4. Pro: In Stockholm that income doesn't even cover the cost of a one bed flat. A typical small radhaus \(terrace\) costs over 20,000 euros a year in rent.
1.3.7.4.1. Con: While Stockholm is the most expensive place to live in Sweden, someone living on welfare in the existing system \(income ~€12000\) can't affort that anyway, so the point is moot.
1.3.7.5. Pro: In the best case scenario, the government would have to scrap many major welfare schemes in order to afford the cost of a UBI.
1.3.7.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.3.7.5.2. Con: That's the point. The idea is to replace means-tested benefits with a universal income that a person can always rely on having.
1.3.7.6. Con: The total cost of UBI is not equal to the amount of money paid to individuals - rather, it is the differential increase or decrease in the wealth of the nation: [scottsantens.com](http://www.scottsantens.com/the-cost-of-universal-basic-income-is-the-net-transfer-amount-not-the-gross-price-tag).
1.3.7.7. Con: Giving every citizen 12,000€ may be unaffordable, but a UBI could be set a lower level than that; say around 6,000€.
1.3.7.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.3.3.
1.3.7.8. Con: What if it would be set as a percentage of GDP and that people could choose if they want UBI, or not \(for the sake of others\). For instance - people with high income from their work could reject their UBI for government budget, charity, or someone else, or to make UBI higher \(could be done only once per year to lower costs of administration\). This could teach people solidarity.
1.3.8. Pro: Most countries are already in debt; a situation that the additional spending required for a UBI will only worsen.
1.3.8.1. Con: While a UBI will probably lead to more spending, that could be offset by potential increases in tax collection from wealthier tax-payers.
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.1.
1.3.8.2. Con: According to International Monetary Fund data released in 2017, the general level of government debt globally is projected to fall, on average, in the years up to 2022. [\(Source: IMF projections\)](http://bit.ly/2hMuYLM)
1.3.8.3. Con: A straight UBI cuts the costs associated with running a complicated welfare system, allowing more budget allocation to go directly to the people receiving welfare instead of it being sunk into administration.
1.3.8.3.1. Con: It is unrealistic to suggest that a decrease in administration cost for welfare systems will make a substantial impact on the total cost of the system.
1.3.8.4. Con: 1. Government debt itself is not inherently bad assuming that the debt is issued in currency it controls and that the increased money supply does not create excessive inflation. 2. Debt may, in fact, have a multiplier effect on the economy by creating a chain reaction of economic activity. In general, when money supply increases at the bottom or through direct spending \(like infrastructure\) the multiplier is greater because the money is spent faster than by tax cuts to the top.
1.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.3.1.3.
1.3.10. Pro: Forms of guaranteed income that are not unconditional would offer many of the benefits of a UBI but at a fraction of the price.
1.3.10.1. Con: Adding conditions inevitably requires bureaucracy and monitoring, which requires costs that do not directly go towards the paying of benefits, increasing the inefficiency of the system.
1.3.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.
1.3.10.2. Pro: A UBI represents higher taxes and a lot more government spending because you're paying everyone instead of just the people on welfare.
1.3.10.2.1. Con: Even if spends would be higher they would be more useful because it would cut down the costs of distribution —which in fact provide no income — and thus put more funds in areas providing at least some value.
1.3.10.2.2. Con: Taxes and spending are not that worrying when everybody gets UBI in the end; if it is done right, most people would receive as much or more than they give, and a small number of very wealthy people would receive less. It's not a matter of higher government spending, but rather of wealth distribution.
1.3.10.2.3. Con: This is solved by adding/increasing the progressive income tax, so that the UBI is paid back after earning a certain amount. The majority of working people will still pay more in taxes than they receive in UBI.
1.3.10.3. Con: The net cost of UBI isn't the UBI amount times amount of people, because everyone who works will have the UBI taxed back depending on income. The net cost is only the amount of UBI that is not taxed back, like when someone doesn't work enough for that to happen.
1.3.10.4. Con: If the income is conditional, then it is not guaranteed.
1.3.10.5. Con: If a conditional income is not fully automatic, it becomes a burden for the people that need it the most. The application and bureaucracy is a huge obstacle when you're not even sure where your next meal will come from.
1.3.10.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.3.11. Con: A [Negative Income Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax) refund is equivalent to a taxed UBI, but cheaper to administer. In 2015, the US spent [$1.4 trillion on Social and Income Security programs](https://taxfoundation.org/how-government-spends-your-tax-dollars/). The [2016 census](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/pinc-01/2016/pinc01_1_1_1.xls) counted over 200 million people with less than $30,000 in annual income \(including [61 million kids](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk)\). If we refund those with no income $10,000 a year and graduate the refund down to zero for incomes over $30,000, [it would cost $1.21 trillion](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FQcVYx1-uYUqswytSM0R50BuICkct-cnKMU-4wVOESE/edit?usp=sharing), saving $200 billion. It's more affordable than the current situation.
1.3.11.1. Con: This would need to be modified so it is not paid in a lump sum, however, as many people are ineffective at saving money and financial planning.
1.3.11.1.1. Pro: The IRS already has already taken steps to move towards a more frequent calculation and payment system \(quarterly, monthly, or per-paycheck\), to dilute the impact of tax season on both taxpayers finances and the agency workload.
1.3.11.2. Con: The data you referenced to only counts people equal or over 15 years old, it doesn't contemplate children at all, if the social and income security programs meet children above this age, them there will be a loss for those out of the scope of this census.
1.3.11.2.1. Con: Parents have financial obligations to their children, discounting the children in this case reinforces parental obligations while reducing the cost of such a plan on the government's budget.
1.3.11.3. Con: These data includes all sources of income including social security, without it there would be many more people who need payment making this unsustainable. Mainly retired people, who receive retirement benefits from social security, and you counted as having income.
1.3.11.3.1. Con: My particular suggestion would replace many welfare programs, but the average income of those programs is less than $10,000. In other words, most people would receive a greater benefit under this scheme. Not that I'm suggesting we suddenly dump all those programs and replace them with this. We'd have to phase the programs out and a UBI in.
1.3.11.3.1.1. Con: The [average retiree collects around $17,000 per year from Social Security](https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/social-security/articles/2018-08-20/how-much-you-will-get-from-social-security), and they account for half of the $1.4 trillion total of Social and Income Security spending. Many of them also have other income sources \(interest on savings being the biggest\) and wouldn't qualify for a Negative Income Tax \(or a much smaller benefit\).
1.3.11.4. Con: This is close to just being a form of means-tested welfare \(albeit a very crude one at best\). Thus, it hardly supports the idea of a true UBI.
1.3.11.4.1. Con: Most proposals of a UBI don't exclude it from taxable income, so it absolutely is comparable to a UBI within a similar tax scheme. The math on how a UBI would be taxed depends on the rest of your income, just like a negative income tax bracket. Labelling this as means-tested is misleading. It's just a UBI that is taxed back if you don't really need it, just like any UBI that isn't tax-exempt would be.
1.3.11.5. Con: Some people may be depending on those $1.4T in social welfare benefits. If 1\) the amount of money provided is reduced by $200B and 2\) it is not concentrated among a more limited group of people, one can expect that some people who were already on the margins will fall below a subsistence or dignified levels.
1.3.12. Con: This is effectively saying that countries do not have enough money to avoid people starving. With very few exceptions, if a country's economy can create millionaires and even billionaires, it can afford to give everybody enough to eat.
1.3.12.1. Pro: Ensuring the life and health of our fellow man is one of our first moral obligations as humans.
1.3.12.1.1. Con: The moral obligations of humans are not the moral obligations of governments.
1.3.12.1.1.1. Con: Democratic governments are not only responsible for the people under their care, but also ideologically should be representative of them. Therefore, they should attempt to carry out their collective moral obligations, without descending into tyranny.
1.3.12.1.1.2. Con: Governments are made up of humans. Those men who are part of governments choose what rights should be defended by the law, so governments have many more moral obligations than normal citizens.
1.3.12.1.2. Con: We are morally obligated to ensure *opportunity,* not outcome—especially if people simply choose not to work. Traditional welfare can target those who are temporarily unfortunate \(e.g. family breadwinner dies\) or long-term disadvantaged \(e.g. disabled\), but a UBI provides a basic income to all people, regardless of their actual need.
1.3.12.1.3. Con: Although we are morally obligated to help others, this does not mean we should be legally compelled to do so, especially considering \(for example\) that what the government considers "need" and what is actually "need" may be 2 different things. Similarly, if the government already taxes its citizens without fixing the problems, it should be hesitant for blaming/shaming the rich for not providing even more.
Ultimately, the parent is missing a crucial link between moral principle and legal policy.
1.3.12.1.3.1. Con: Many people do not carry out moral obligations they do not immediately see/feel or are not aware of; legal mechanisms ensure moral obligations are fulfilled.
1.3.12.2. Con: An economy can have the potential to create a large amount of wealth, but still be unable to produce enough of a certain resource, such as food.
1.3.12.2.1. Con: Many of the countries in question produce enough food to comfortably feed more there population without any type of intervention.
1.3.12.2.2. Con: Whilst this is theoretically possible, the issue with millionaires in an economy where people are starving is that they represent a concentration of clout at the expense of others. When one person has a greater income in a day than another does in a year, it is not that the first is working harder: it is that they are profiting from the others work at their expense.
1.3.12.2.2.1. Pro: Investing does not directly produce any labour or products.
1.3.12.2.2.2. Con: Remuneration can be for work but for the most part in modern societies with free markets people are remunerated for their contribution to society. Those with the greatest contributions tend to be those who have produced innovation or improved efficiency. Thus much wealth transfer is a result of society "voting" for the contributions they value most by purchasing them in markets.
1.3.12.3. Con: In wealthier countries, very few people actually face even temporary starvation in a given year. In the U.S., for example,[less than 1% of the population](https://mises.org/library/america-struggling-hunger) faces hunger in a given year and [less than 4,000 people](http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/malnutrition/by-country/) die from starvation or malnutrition. Estimates of how much a UBI would cost [vary](http://basicincome.org/news/2017/05/much-ubi-cost/) from 595 billion to over 4 trillion. Giving 1% of the population $150 a month for food to cover both starvation and food insecurity would only cost $5.9 billion.
1.3.12.4. Con: Most halfway-decent countries have enough money to "prevent people from starving," but the costs to maintain people above the poverty line are far more than just "providing enough money to prevent starvation." For example, people also need bare minimum levels of shelter, clothing, transportation, medicine, energy, and purpose/occupation—just to name a few examples. All of these expenses start adding up to thousands per year per person.
1.3.12.5. Con: The [grandparent claim](https://www.kialo.com/argument/1634.1473) is merely disputing that a UBI should be imposed instead of welfare. Governments are capable of providing welfare, but the costs of providing *Universal* basic income at a level which *meets the poverty line* are \(likely\) far greater than traditional, basic welfare for the needy.
1.3.12.6. Pro: Nations who control their own currency spend what it takes on what is most important to them. If the nation's priory is the dignity and productivity of its people, then it can't afford not to have a generous UBI.
1.3.13. Con: Implementing a UBI would allow governments to reduce spending in other areas; thus reducing its cost.
1.3.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.3.13.2. Pro: A UBI would also allow the government to consolidate or eliminate negative income tax payments, such as the earned income tax credit in the US, [which currently costs between $60 and $90 billion](https://www.cato.org/publications/tax-budget-bulletin/earned-income-tax-credit-small-benefits-large-costs).
1.3.13.2.1. Con: $60-90 billion is a mere fraction of what a reasonable UBI would cost.
1.3.13.3. Pro: The estimated net costs of an UBI in the US add up to [$539 billion annually \($20,000/individual\)](http://basicincome.org/news/2017/05/much-ubi-cost/). The UBI would decrease the official poverty rate from actual 13.5% to roughly 0%. Currently, the US spends [$550 billion on poverty](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/09/13/if-the-us-spends-550-billion-on-poverty-how-can-there-still-be-poverty-in-the-us/#5e6452d8fdf6) every year, achieving modest success only.
1.3.13.3.1. Con: This only considers the official poverty rate at the moment; if inflation \(or segmented inflation—i.e. inflation mainly just on low-cost goods and services\) were to occur, the official poverty line may rise, causing poverty rates to increase.
1.3.13.3.1.1. Pro: Segmented inflation realistically might occur since more people will be buying low-income goods/services that previously could not be afforded by so many people, such as basic foodstuffs, low-cost housing, cheap cars, etc.
1.3.13.3.2. Con: If people who acquire the money cannot or do not use it to meet their needs, such as if the people are mentally ill, struggling with addiction, elderly, disabled, etc., then the official poverty rate would be misleading, since some people would still be living in poverty conditions \(e.g. homeless, hungry\).
1.3.13.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.5.4.1.
1.3.13.3.4. Con: If those poverty programs were not cut then the new total cost of social spending would be $1089 billion dollars.
1.3.14. Con: A UBI would enable other forms of revenue collection that could help offset its cost.
1.3.14.1. Pro: Companies that use robotics in lieu of humans should pay an "income tax" on the robots' work. This money would go directly to UBI.
1.3.14.1.1. Con: This may incentivize hiring unnecessary human workers \(and thus wasting man-hours\) rather than automating industry.
1.3.14.1.2. Con: This presupposes a society where automation has become very extensive; as of yet this is not applicable to society.
1.3.14.1.3. Con: Taxing robots would be a tax on private property which would be immoral. Private property is an inalienable human right and therefore shouldn't be taxed.
1.3.14.1.3.1. Con: Property taxes, such as local rates, are an established form of taxation, and not inherently less fair than any other form of taxation.
1.3.14.1.3.1.1. Con: Real estate is not private property. Ownership of real estate is defined by public registry \(a deed\) not by possession. Real estate ownership exists as a virtual concept within the boundary of a nation state. The unfortunately named "property tax" is therefore not a tax on private property. You "own" real estate because society says you own it and for that privilege, you pay a societal tax and thus it is inherently more fair than other forms \(such as "income tax"\).
1.3.14.1.3.1.2. Con: Property taxes are unfair to those on a fixed income.  Retired people are especially hit hard as taxes and inflation go up, but their income remains the same.
1.3.14.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.4.2.
1.3.14.1.4. Pro: UBIs or some equivalent distribution are inevitable because the world is becoming so rich that AI and robots will do all the work. Distributing their wealth equitably is the only way to avoid dystopic revolution and mass genocide.
1.3.14.1.4.1. Pro: Growth of world product per person is at about $10K and growing exponentially so by 2099 it may be at today's $100K. If it were distributed equitably now it could generate a lot of creativity.
1.3.14.1.4.2. Con: No matter how quickly or much the world's wealth grows, the elites will suck it all up  for their personal possession. The greed at the top is unquenchable, and their haughty, uncaring distaste for others is misanthropic.
1.3.14.1.5. Pro: A UBI funded by the corporations that benefit from automation could be a more viable route than strictly using government funds. UBI is an inevitability with automation's pace accelerating, and the companies that benefit from that should still be forced to pay some amount to the people that their increased productivity puts out of work.
1.3.14.1.5.1. Con: Companies have no inherent incentive to be altruistic, or give away any more of their profit than is necessary.
1.3.14.2. Pro: A government is the property of its people, much like a corporation where each citizen holds one share. Governments, like corporations, should pay a dividend to their owners - forming a UBI.
1.3.14.2.1. Con: Unfortunately, most of the governments are not making profit, but doing quite the  opposite: borrowing more and more money. In reality, this wouldn't work out.
1.3.14.2.1.1. Con: Government is not in the business of making money, so monetary measures of their success are not appropriate.
1.3.14.2.2. Con: This would incentivize the government to make a profit, which should not be its role, and may lead to harsher and more draconian \(or even exploitative\) economic policies being put into place at the expense of the wellbeing of the general community, such as cuts to essential services, other public services, government worker wages, etc. Governments should not function or be explicitly encouraged to be run like corporations.
1.3.14.2.2.1. Con: There would be no incentive for government to maximize profits because unlike a corporation, 100% of government revenue would be returned to the citizens in the form of a UBI. A corporation tries to give shareholders a maximum return but a government would only give citizens a minimum UBI —  so there's no reason for a government to ever raise taxes beyond the minimum amount necessary to pay UBI and cover the expenses of other mandatory functions.
1.3.14.2.3. Pro: A UBI is a rightful claim of the public on a part of modern productivity. Productivity gains thanks to automation were made possible to a significant extent by means of research carried out by publicly funded institutions like universities \(at least in Europe\). So the public should benefit from this gained productivity.
1.3.14.2.4. Pro: The UBI is a right derived from the principle that the earth belongs to all of us and all shall profit from its proceeds.
1.3.14.2.5. Pro: Society jointly owns the right to control its natural resources \(e.g. land, water, spectrum and air\). Governments are created to lease those rights \(via taxes\) to individuals who may \(or may not\) profit from the temporary, exclusive use of a resource. The tax revenue should therefore be distributed among individuals as compensation for their share of society's natural resources. After paying UBI, then society can fund schools, parks, roads, police, foreign aid, etc. Any other scheme is immoral.
1.3.14.2.6. Pro: The idea that wealth must be "earned" is based in the erroneous assumption that everything doesn't belong to everyone in the first place. All wealth is sourced from natural resources. The Earth belongs to all of us. The intellectual property that is used to transform natural resources into other types of wealth also belongs to everyone, as no idea is original or autonomous.
1.3.14.2.6.1. Con: If I build a house it doesn't belong to you. You can go out in the woods and cut down some trees and gather the rest of the resources available and build one by yourself, but in our society, we mostly have a division of labour, where we use money as a medium to exchange goods and services. No wealth is sourced from natural resources. All wealth \(as determined in voluntary exchange\) is sourced from human labour.
1.3.14.2.7. Con: Governments are not "owned", they are a way of organising rules in a society. A government might choose to put in place a rule whereby money is taken from some \(the wealthy\) and redistributed equally, forming a UBI, but that is a choice not a product of "ownership".
1.3.14.2.8. Con: Ultimately wealth comes not from resources but from the time spent by someone to make something of little worth into something of more worth. UBI forces people to give some of their time to others. This may or may not be a good thing, but understanding where wealth comes from is important.
1.3.14.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.7.1.4.
1.3.14.4. Pro: Many economists have suggested revenue neutral workable UBI plans that are affordable. For example, the [FairTax version of UBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax) has been studied by economists at the beacon hill institute and in-house economists with various government institutions and concluded that it would be able to cover 30% of the needs at the poverty level with no change to existing welfare programs. If we further assume that some portion of existing welfare programs would be reallocated, that percentage increases.
1.3.15. Pro: Since this would have to be funded by taxes, as more recipients began to rely on it as a source of income there would be increasingly less funds to pay for it setting up an inevitable unfunded deficit.
1.3.15.1. Pro: A UBI could not be successfully funded as employed taxpayers make up the base, therefore publicly funded programs will become ripe for private take over.
1.3.15.2. Con: This is not the case if the increasing gains from automation were also taxed.
1.3.15.2.1. Con: Taxing automation would discourage automation, which UBI fundamentally relies on.
1.3.15.2.1.1. Con: UBI is in no way built on or relying on automation. It was proposed way before industrialization even: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income#History)
1.3.15.3. Pro: If everyone got a paycheck whether they worked or not, there would be little incentive to pay the taxes required to disburse a UBI.
1.3.15.4. Pro: UBI requires funds to enact, and those funds must be generated before they're dispersed. If everyone is on a UBI, then no one is required to generate those funds, and it becomes a 'chicken or the egg' paradox. If only some are on a UBI, then non-UBI people will be forced to hand over a chunk of their generated income to fund UBI. There is no free meal ticket.
1.3.16. Con: A UBI need not meet the poverty line to be an improvement over status quo. The parent discussion over-specified what a UBI must be.
1.3.16.1. Con: Even if the UBI did not meet the poverty line—such as if it only met half of the poverty line—it would likely still be extraordinarily expensive while not even solving the issues at hand.
1.3.16.2. Pro: Many Americans work two or three jobs. Simply being able to quit one of these jobs would mean the world to millions of single working parents across this country.
1.3.16.3. Pro: Even though an affordable UBI may not be sufficient to prevent poverty by Western standards, it should still provide enough to avoid extreme stress and inequality. With additional income or provision possible under a UBI low-paid employment will become both feasible and attractive as a form of self-provision.
1.3.17. Con: Speaking for England: if the government gave everyone over 18 £6k p.a. and people paid for their own healthcare it could cut tax by half; back to pre-WWII levels.
1.3.17.1. Con: UBI is supposed to be in addition to services provided by the state \(eg healthcare, emergency services etc\) not as a replacement to it.
1.3.18. Con: While there may not be any country that can afford a UBI today, it does not mean a particularly wealthy country could never afford one. The parent question specifies "A wealthy country" but not how wealthy that country must be. The condition of any one country \(Or any number of countries\) does not in any way invalidate the idea of a UBI. Only that we are not ready just yet.
1.3.18.1. Pro: The march of automation and artificial intelligence will provide levels of surplus that make a UBI more readily affordable.
1.3.18.1.1. Pro: Automation means providing the same goods and services with fewer people. If a job is no longer necessary but society could support that person previously, why can it not support that person afterwards?
1.3.18.1.2. Pro: Increases in technology will eventually result in an excess of productivity. Government issued UBI is necessary to distribute the returns on this productivity equitably.
1.3.18.1.2.1. Pro: When [productivity reaches incredibly high rates](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/519016/stop-saying-robots-are-destroying-jobs-they-arent/), there will be no need to have as many people working. Instead, we could afford to distribute a UBI to the increasingly large number of people who would no longer work.
1.3.18.1.2.1.1. Con: The excess productivity could be incentive to layoff the amount of workers it would displace and maintain all other operations as normal. This would create even more profit for corporations due to no longer needing to pay wages and supplemental benefits.
1.3.18.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Corporations look after themselves before their employees. If it is beneficial to them to be rid of employees, there will definitely be cuts.
1.3.18.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Those profits would be taxed at a high rate and distributed as UBI. By distributing buying power to laid-off workers, UBI allows the capitalist market system to survive under conditions where many people are not working most of the time.
1.3.18.1.2.1.2. Con: Productivity growth[has been stagnant or in decline](https://www.oecd.org/std/productivity-stats/) in most OECD nations. The [data shows no relationship between productivity growth and net unemployment](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/519016/stop-saying-robots-are-destroying-jobs-they-arent/).
1.3.18.1.2.2. Con: The returns on this productivity could equally be distributed by lowering tax rates for low/middle income earners or increasing public funding for existing welfare, education, or healthcare systems.
1.3.18.1.2.2.1. Con: The chain of command of a public administration has fixed costs, plus the variable one related to corruption. The use of unneeded intermediaries decreases efficiency and raises costs.
1.3.18.1.2.3. Pro: A UBI is necessary and plausible if AI is to take a majority of jobs on the market. It is necessary as a majority of people who do work now will no longer be able to find jobs. It is plausible as AI will reduce the cost of many products and services available to us, thus we will be able to enjoy more with less, in which case the total living cost will be reduced, thus the amount of UBI necessary will be reduced \(discounting inflation etc\).
1.3.18.1.2.4. Pro: UBI allows us to continue with technological advances without the worry of losing jobs. In fact, because of technology and the ability it has to reduce the work needed by humans, UBI is necessary. Imagine a farmer in the 19th century and the amount of work needed to sustain a farm compared to today. The same amount of time, effort, and work could now feed hundreds if not thousands and all families should reap the rewards of this advancement!
1.3.18.1.2.5. Pro: UBI is a necessity for the economy in the future. Due to increases in automation, there will be a shortage of suppy for the workforce. In contrast to this, the people at the top of the business will earn huge amounts of money; creating an income gap like we’ve never seen before. It might not be time for UBI right now, but it’s definitely a solution to future problems.
1.3.18.1.2.6. Pro: Global wealth is not a fixed quantity: as technology improves, the world economy sees an aggregate benefit without requiring anyone else's wealth to decrease commensurately. UBI is an appropriate response to the aggregate increase of global wealth because of technology.
1.3.18.1.3. Con: This is just another way to describe heavier taxation of industry, which eventually damages your economy's competitiveness and tax revenues.
1.3.18.1.4. Pro: A society in a position to implement a UBI presupposes automation and AI. With mechanized efficiency and without the cost of human labor it is necessary to reevaluate the costs of living in a post-scarcity society when determining the economic viability of a UBI.
1.3.18.2. Pro: The affordability problem can be avoided by implementing a UBI only when an economy is mature enough that it is beneficial. A society requiring only ~70% of its citizens to contribute to the labor force is by definition producing enough excess that it can fund some minimal standard of living for the remaining 30%. Finding the relevant line is important, but this is a problem regarding execution, not the concept itself.
1.3.18.3. Con: The question seems to imply whether a UBI should be implemented today as part of the discussion around how to socially adjust to AI. To say 'we are not there yet' still argues that this shouldn't be allowed as we are incapable of implementing the idea. If it is impossible to implement, then we shouldn't consider it.
1.3.18.4. Con: It is also possible that if/when governments can eventually afford UBIs they will also have better or more means-tested welfare, making UBIs still inferior. In other words, in the future it might be better to just stick with means-tested welfare which has been increased/improved.
1.3.18.5. Con: Such a hypothetical future where the economy has massive surplus potentially may not even be struggling with extreme poverty. Unless the claim/we identify what this hypothetical/theoretical future society looks like, it is difficult to evaluate how practical/beneficial a UBI would be in the society.
1.3.18.6. Con: UBI depends on an unsustainable level of global market wealth. If every economy achieved the kind of market success - that would be required to pay its citizens a UBI - we would need far more global growth. The Limits to Growth analysis \(see - [youtu.be](https://youtu.be/U7Z6h-U4CmI)\) clearly tells us this would require several more planets.
1.3.19. Pro: A country that introduces a UBI would see a great influx of immigrants seeking the UBI. Without tight immigration control, the costs of the scheme would run out of control.
1.3.19.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.7.
1.3.20. Con: The US already pays nearly $10,000 to many taxpayers in the form of the standard deduction. Changing the standard deduction from a non-refundible tax credit into a refundible tax credit \(a one-line change to the tax code\) would constitute a basic income structure. It would then be revenue-neutral for the middle class, replace pell grants for college students, replace the earned income tax credit for many low-income families, and replace or overlap with social security for the elderly.
1.3.21. Con: A [UBI](http://morganfoundation.org.nz/why-the-guardian-is-wrong-on-ubi/) is a redistributive transfer; it is not a new cost the government must meet. Rather it’s a cost to some and a windfall to others - the net cost is zero.
1.3.21.1. Con: UBIs impose this cost on people who have worked to earn their money.
1.3.21.1.1. Con: That is true of all existing tax systems and of all existing welfare systems.
1.3.21.1.2. Con: The work one does today couldn't be done without previous generations' work, since fire handling to the first wheel, from writing to printing press, the transistor, internet, etc. UBI then, is paid thanks to all wealth created in history as a dividend. It's an effective way to make everybody access this heritage as a right.
1.3.21.1.3. Con: A UBI imposes this cost on those who have won the lottery of birth. The difference between an executive and an apple-picker is more likely due to systemic factors than a result of either person's choices.
1.3.21.1.3.1. Con: Of the 29 richest people in the US, [most were not born rich](http://www.businessinsider.com/richest-people-in-the-us-2016-1/#19-sheldon-adelson-11).
1.3.21.1.4. Con: This assumes people are getting money based on the actual value they're adding to the system. The redistribution would make up for some of the difference generated when someone gains capital without adding enough value back into the system.
1.3.21.1.5. Con: Many wealthy people have far more money than can ever have been earned through products of labor. Let's assume that someone is doing a job with such intense labor that they earn $6000 an hour. If this person worked 60 hours a week, every single week, for 50 years, and didn't spend a penny of their income on food, housing, taxes, or anything else, they still would not be a billionaire. Anyone with that much money has been exploiting those under them and their money should be redistributed.
1.3.21.1.5.1. Con: There are more sources of income than production and exploitation. Investing in somebody else their business is not exploitation and one of the more common ways of earning enough to become a billionaire. Running a successful business yourself is another way.
1.3.21.1.6. Con: This argument assumes that all income comes from human activity. With the introduction and proliferation of automation and AI, more and more of the income will be due to activities performed by non-human actors, effectively making an UBI a redistribution from non-human to human actors.
1.3.21.2. Pro: Most of those receiving a UBI also pay, on net, positive amounts of tax. Therefore, when calculating the cost of a UBI, it doesn't make sense to to calculate their UBI as a cost when it can easily be offset by a small tax increase.
1.3.21.2.1. Con: This would, in effect, invalidate the whole definition of "universal" basic income—this proposal essentially just says "we make it universal, but the rich don't get any benefits in the end." In other words, it would make more sense to only pay the poor, rather than also paying the rich.
1.3.21.2.2. Con: As per basic accounting, all the flows of money \(costs and revenue\) should be accounted for, or else people will be more liable to make accounting/policy errors. Thus, it may be true that these costs might be offset by "a small tax increase," but we still have to account for the total expenditures. Otherwise \(for example\), people might forget that taxes must be raised in order to offset the UBI for rich people.
1.3.21.2.2.1. Pro: It is particularly important to account for the payments to rich people because these payments previously were not being made \(e.g. under targeted welfare systems\).
1.3.21.3. Con: Redistribution reduces production by decreasing the incentive to work. Hence redistribution creates a net loss to society, not zero as claimed.
1.3.21.3.1. Con: A person needs a certain amount of income in order to be capable of productive work. Issues associated with poverty prevent people from entering the labour force.
1.3.21.3.1.1. Pro: Poverty is stressful, as is starting a new job. If someone cannot handle that stress, they can easily become trapped in poverty, unable to successfully commence employment.
1.3.21.3.1.2. Pro: Health issues can prevent one from being able to work, but may require costly surgery, medicine, or other treatment to successfully treat.
1.3.21.3.1.2.1. Con: Targeted welfare may be more effective at improving such situations, providing the needed medicine or treatment free or at a discounted cost.
1.3.21.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Targeted welfare requires identification of the cases where it is needed - creating "gaps" in the "net" which cases may "slip through", as well as requiring bureaucracy and administration and investigation/inquisition to find and confirm the cases that would require it. A UBI would avoid these issues by being unconditionally available to everyone.
1.3.21.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: If a targeted welfare program requires would-be beneficiaries to come forward to it, this creates several issues - would-be beneficiaries may not know about it, may not have the time or ability to do what is required of them to access it, or may feel that it is stigmatized or prefer to "deal with their own problems themselves". A UBI would avoid these issues also by being unconditionally available to everyone.
1.3.21.3.2. Con: Most people will still want to work at least part time to supplement their UBI, provided working conditions are safe and reasonable.
1.3.21.3.3. Con: [The multiplier effect](http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Managing_the_economy/The_multiplier_effect.html) shows that the accumulation of capital harms the national economy. By redirecting money pooling at the top through a [continual redistribution](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-santens/why-should-we-support-the_b_7630162.html) from the top-middle down to the bottom-middle of the income spectrum, the entire economy would actually expand while becoming more sustainable and more inclusive.
1.3.21.3.3.1. Pro: Consumption expenditure differs substantially between low and high-income groups: [it is estimated](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-santens/why-should-we-support-the_b_7630162.html) that low-wage workers add about $1.21 to the national economy per dollar they have to spend, while high-income workers only add about 39 cents. Redistribution would therefore help expand the economy.
1.3.21.3.3.2. Con: Increased savings still operate in the economy because they become savings that reduce the costs of borrowing.
1.3.21.3.3.3. Con: Increased capital and investment leads to greater investment which in turn leads to increased productivity that creates more jobs.
1.3.21.3.3.3.1. Con: This [IMF study](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Staff-Discussion-Notes/Issues/2016/12/31/Causes-and-Consequences-of-Income-Inequality-A-Global-Perspective-42986) \(also covered [here](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/15/focus-on-low-income-families-to-boost-economic-growth-says-imf-study)\)shows that trickle down economics does not work.
Giving tax breaks to rich people/businesses actively harms economic growth and equality.
It goes on to say that if you give that money to the poor and middle class, the economy grows.
1.3.21.3.3.4. Pro: Better wages, conditions, and more money in the hands of low earners, has been shown to improve aggregate demand and therefore grow the economy. Therefore, reversing the tax cuts for the wealthy of recent decades, and redistributing that wealth into the economy will improve economic conditions, as opposed to having it languish in offshore investments and unproductive assets.
1.3.21.3.3.5. Con: Increased spending on consumption is bad for the environment.
1.3.21.3.3.5.1. Con: Green products, which have a more [positive impact](http://www.ripublication.com/gjmbs_spl/gjmbsv3n6_09.pdf) on mankind and the environment, cost on average [50% more](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/7785705/Green-goods-cost-nearly-50-more.html) than non-green products. With a UBI, more individuals will have more funds to purchase green products, resulting in a less harmful impact on the environment.
1.3.21.3.3.5.1.1. Con: Even if a UBI results in people having more money, that doesn't imply people would choose to spend the extra money on more environmentally friendly products.  For example, if a person is too poor to afford a car, they take the bus to work.  But once they have enough money they buy a car, which hurts the environment rather than helps.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2. Con: A UBI would be beneficial for those who fight for the environment's protection.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.1. Pro: A UBI would help NGOs that dedicate themselves to environmental protection, as they can save activists' salaries and thus have more available capital.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.2. Pro: Citizens who are concerned about the environment will be able to donate larger amounts with the help of a UBI.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.2.1. Con: Considering much of the redistributed income will go towards the poor, as the wealthy citizens' gain is marginal, it seems unlikely they will donate higher amounts to the environment. It is more likely they will spend the money on education, food, health care, and housing.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.2.1.1. Con: Lower Incomes donate a higher percentage of income  than any other income bracket. The IRS’s 2011 Statistics of Income file on individuals who itemize on their tax return shows a relationship between total adjusted gross income and charitable giving as a percentage of AGI. Those with income between $100,000 and $200,000 contribute, on average, 2.6 percent of their income, which is lower compared to those with income either below $100,000 \(3.6 percent\).
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.3. Con: Many of the wealthy who donated or invested much of their income to the protection of the environment will no longer be able to do so because of the increase in taxes.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.3.1. Con: If charity [donations](https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/overview) are fiscally [deductible](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/charitable-contribution-deductions), a lot of wealthy individuals will still donate.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.4. Pro: Currently, social workers and NGO workers, who are helping a lot of people, are paid very poorly for their meaningful work. This deters many people from entering the non-profit sector.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.4.1. Pro: Governments are [investing less and less](https://books.google.it/books?id=JcPiBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA298&lpg=PA298&dq=crisis+government+cut+social+aid&source=bl&ots=PUj8DMEcpk&sig=OEDtkapMpf1Efhh8BW8cXng47S0&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJoLnh563RAhVEVhoKHUnwApoQ6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&q=crisis%20government%20cut%20social%20aid&f=false) money for social aids, leaving to NGOs the important role to replace this obligation. A UBI would reward their work with governmental funds.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.4.2. Con: A UBI does not make this work relatively more appealing, as the bonus income will equally apply to all jobs.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.4.2.1. Con: There are people already choosing these jobs despite economical hardships, which points to greater motivations to do so.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: It is likely that once economic worries are eliminated, even more people would choose to dedicate their working hours towards a cause they resonate with rather than opting for whatever pays the most.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.4.2.1.2. Pro: Most people entering the nonprofit sector are driven by a greater purpose and are engaged by inspiring missions.
1.3.21.3.3.5.2.4.3. Con: How do you define meaningful? In a capitalist society, a job is paid exactly what it's worth, if the person doing that job wants to be paid more all they have to do is ask to be paid more. If it turns out no one will pay them what they're asking for, then society has deemed it's not worth that much.
1.3.21.3.3.5.3. Con: If a UBI's implementation means [a shorter working week](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/09/basic-income-short-working-week-green-institute-report), this will also reduce commutes, which will reduce emissions and be beneficial for the environment.
1.3.21.3.3.5.3.1. Con: Fewer working hours means more recreational hours and recreation has a higher environmental impact than working. For example, recreation in the UK already accounts for [20% of CO2 emissions](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/your-carbon-footprint-revealed-climate-change-report-finds-we-each-produce-11-tons-of-carbon-a-year-427664.html).
1.3.21.3.3.5.3.2. Con: A shorter work week leads to more commuting, as more people need to do the same work \(assuming the same work needs to be done\).
1.3.21.3.3.5.4. Con: With added income, more people will have the ability to pay for college, which will enrich the scientific labor force attempting to study and combat climate change.
1.3.21.3.3.5.5. Con: A UBI tied to a value based on the total sustainable natural services, including renewably-sourced human and animal products, of each region. This would solve both intranational ecological exploitation and international inequities due to colonialism/neoliberalism/etc. while providing a natural, measurable de-externalization of capitalist production costs.[Environmentally Sustainable National Income - A new alternative marcoindicator](http://www.oecd.org/site/worldforum06/38828016.pdf)
1.3.21.3.3.5.5.1. Pro: [Global economic enfranchisement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tralfamadoran777) accomplishes this by paying an equal share of the interest paid in money creation to each, a functional tax on all money, which is "a value based on the total sustainable..." and will also fill the data gaps referenced in the link, by providing data from each.
1.3.21.3.3.5.6. Con: Many people work jobs they know to be environmentally damaging in order to earn enough for a decent life. A UBI would allow them to stop.
1.3.21.3.3.5.7. Con: Having a higher base income allows people to more easily [make capital investments in green technologies](http://basicincome.org/news/2016/08/green-technology-another-reason-need-basic-income/) \(e.g. solar panels\) that would previously have been unaffordable.
1.3.21.3.3.5.8. Con: UBI helps address climate change by reducing commuting time, office space, and consumerism. It allows people to engage in enriching low-carbon activities such as small-scale farming, art, and study.
1.3.21.3.3.5.9. Con: A UBI makes it possible to effectively fight climate change and environmental damage by loosening relationship between welfare and GDP growth. Societies will no longer have to rely on infinite, exponential economic growth and creating useless jobs that create no social value in order to ensure basic survival of individuals.
1.3.21.3.3.5.9.1. Pro: Instead, these useless jobs consume resources that might produce goods \(that also consume resources\) that no one can buy. A UBI would allow people to have the capability instead to get useful jobs \(because people will have enough money to apply to them and also because they will not be so strapped for cash that they resort to these useless jobs\).
1.3.21.3.3.5.9.2. Pro: Useless jobs have a negative social value \(at the individual level\). The more a person is at a useless job, the less skills they can gain towards a useful job.
1.3.21.3.3.5.9.3. Pro: Waste would not be such as big issue if capitalism did not pressure companies to overproduce goods. Instead of gauging and guessing at demand, but most likely getting it wrong \(overproducing or under-producing\), a UBI would let consumption switch to on-demand production.
1.3.21.3.3.5.9.3.1. Pro: For example, people could 3D print their own goods, however much or small, which can eliminate a lot of waste and unnecessary jobs \(especially since people would not need them anymore\).
1.3.21.3.3.5.9.3.2. Con: Some manufacturing methods of overproduction are unavoidable unless an improvement is made in production process. Mining raw materials is a good example, because some of these processing plants need to be continuously running in order to make the production economically viable.
1.3.21.3.3.5.10. Con: Not all consumption is bad for the environment. As we move further into the digital age, more and more of what people spend their money on is not physical.
1.3.21.3.3.5.11. Pro: [Families and homes with similar incomes tend to own similar homes and objects](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/matrix). A low universal basic income give a lot of people and families a very similar low income which will lead to a strong increase of similar cheap products which can lead to [environmental complications](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150928153039.htm) and can have a [negative impact on climate change](https://mahb.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Meat-the-Biggest-Threat-and-Opportunity-to-Climate-Change-FINAL.pdf).
1.3.21.3.3.6. Pro: By redistributing wealth, UBI raises the proportion of the population capable of buying certain goods and services - this will stimulate the economy more than the same money sitting dormant in the savings accounts of the most well-off people
1.3.21.3.3.6.1. Pro: A UBI is good for the economy as people will generally have more money to spend and more time to spend it. This will mean most businesses will make more money.
1.3.21.3.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.13.2.1.
1.3.21.3.3.8. Pro: Once people can easily afford basic goods like food, water or shelter, or health, this would release public money from health-related spending like  disease prevention and boost the income of private companies with millions of new consumers. The company's new income would boost tax  revenue and help compensate the initial investment in the UBI.
1.3.21.3.3.9. Pro: Increasing the incomes of the poor could actually improve the economy by virtue of redistribution of wealth. The current wealth situation is not only abhorrently imbalanced, it actually harms the economy by locking up cash flow in the form of savings. A UBI might stimulate the economy, provided the tax is levied on those with income greater than 8 figures.
1.3.21.3.3.10. Con: This does not hold for permanent programs such as UBI. The long-term real GDP of a country is determined by economic inputs of capital and labor, not consumption. At full employment of a country's resources, fiscal stimulus will push up prices and imports, leaving real production unchanged. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Keynesian_economics)
1.3.21.3.3.10.1. Con: A UBI would allow workers to exit the poverty trap, increasing the Aggregate Supply of the country and leading to increased economic growth.
1.3.21.3.3.11. Pro: If people do not need to hoard money for retirement or investments, then money could circulate better and increase the multiplier effect.
1.3.21.3.3.12. Pro: The increase in the multiplier effect by the UBI allows it to be sustainable, so it can pay for itself.
1.3.21.3.3.13. Con: A UBI could only ever cover basic living costs, meaning that those on a UBI could not enjoy all the benefits of life or be consumers of higher level goods, thus reducing demand, leading to even less people employed.
1.3.21.3.3.14. Pro: A UBI would be a boom to the economy. It would be almost like the opposite of trickle-down economics. Rich people can afford to save additional income but poor people have a more urgent need to spend the money. This increase in economic activity would spur hiring and investment.
1.3.21.3.3.15. Pro: UBI would also guarnteed a baseline of economic activity because there would be a highly reliable amount of demand that comes from a highly predictable income.
1.3.21.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.3.21.3.5. Con: There are plenty of non-financial incentives to work, which may in fact increase the incentive to work when one is not being forced by financial pressures into working a job they would prefer not to.
1.3.21.3.6. Con: A UBI will redistribute wealth and thereby give more opportunities to the poor, enabling the overwhelming majority of the population to be more productive.
1.3.21.3.6.1. Pro: A UBI will increase the purchasing power of the currently poor, thus increasing economic activity at the lower socioeconomic brackets and driving demand for goods and services.
1.3.21.3.7. Con: If the UBI is financed by a tax on the top 1% then for 99% the incentive to work will remain the same.
1.3.21.4. Con: Redistribution means disruption and causes changes in the marketplace. If it were a worldwide system, it would at least eliminate the flight of businesses to other countries, but issues would still remain.
1.3.21.5. Con: Redistribution has administrative costs for the government, besides indirect effects that could harm the economy thus reducing income from taxes.
1.3.21.5.1. Con: UBI redistribution has less administrative costs than other forms of welfare that require complicated and time-consuming means testing.
1.3.21.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.3.21.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.
1.3.21.6. Con: It’s inefficient to take money from wealthy or middle class citizens only to give it back to them. It makes more sense to just let them keep it in the first place.
1.3.21.6.1. Con: This does nothing to prevent poverty or poverty-related suffering and deaths.
1.3.21.6.1.1. Con: Neither does giving money to rich people, which is what the UBI does.
1.3.21.6.1.1.1. Con: People who are wealthy today may not necessarily be wealthy tomorrow. In different stages of someone's life, they may do high-powered work, invest in businesses or enterprise, and/or subsist on UBI respectively. It is good for everyone to have the option available to them.
1.3.21.6.1.1.2. Con: The U in UBI is the reason for this. It's universal, which means that all people will receive it. This is mitigated with higher taxes on higher wealth individuals.
1.3.21.6.2. Con: It can be done in an extremely simple one line addition to the tax form.
1.3.21.7. Con: It is unjust for the government to take a meaningful sum from a class of people who disagree with how it would be used.
1.3.21.7.1. Con: Quite a few people object to either welfare programs, or military spending, but both of them are still very high, and at least to some degree, necessary.
1.3.21.7.2. Con: That class of people would not have been able to earn and/or inherit the money in the first place if it wasn't for the society that the government is tasked with protecting and developing. If UBI sufficiently enhances society then the government has the right to charge the people that benefit \(financially\) from the society the most for its continued upkeep and enhancement.
1.3.21.7.3. Con: This is logically flawed. In a democratic system, the government must fulfil the wishes of the voting majority. It is meaningless to refuse to pay tax because you, personally, did not vote for it. The policy is a national policy, voted by the country.
1.3.21.8. Con: The net cost would not be zero as there would be cost associated with managing the system.
1.3.21.8.1. Con: The cost associated with managing a UBI is \(almost by definition\) far less than the current cost of a selective welfare system, thus creating a net saving \(reduction in current costs\).
1.3.21.9. Con: UBI is made of two parts: 1\) collect money, and 2\) redistribute it. The first part is not redistributive by itself and has limits, you cannot confiscate with taxes more money than what it exist in the economy.
1.3.21.10. Pro: For instance, a 26.51% tax levied flat across all income levels in the US and distributed to all working age adults \(206,585,933 people\) would result in a $25,003 UBI for everyone after taxes \(based on a GDP of $19.484 trillion\). Those who earn little or nothing, such as college students, would make $25k. Someone who is currently at the poverty line \($19k\) would be topped up to almost $39k. Someone earning $58k would be topped up to more then $67k. 0% tax impact would be at $94k per worker.
1.3.21.10.1. Pro: Couple this with abolishing minimum wage requirements and US labor could become more profitable for businesses.
1.3.21.10.1.1. Con: Cheap labor being subsidized by a UBI could discourage companies from innovating more efficient ways of doing things, slowing growth.
1.4. Pro: A UBI makes it possible for some people to work less.
1.4.1. Pro: For the less advantaged in society whose jobs often involve physical labour, work is often a hard and unrewarding. A UBI helps relieve them of some of this burden.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Marx wrote that '[the realm of freedom](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch48.htm) actually begins only where labour which is determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases'.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Higher levels of income and education [are associated](http://www.gallup.com/poll/18109/most-workers-positive-onethird-love-their-jobs.aspx) with higher levels of job satisfaction.
1.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.5.
1.4.2. Pro: If average working hours were fewer, it would enable them to be more evenly distributed; reducing both overwork and underwork. Sharing work more evenly reduces the load on those overworked and provides more opportunities for the underworked to do more.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Keynes saw a reduction in the work week as a way to [help combat unemployment](https://mronline.org/2010/07/22/the-keynesian-cure/).
1.4.2.2. Con: The amount of work is not a fixed figure. Working creates the goods and services that humans want, and human wants are unlimited; therefore, the amount of work needed to fulfill these wants is unlimited as well.
1.4.2.3. Con: The unequal distribution of work is a result of optimization with regards to the unequal distribution of expertise and specialization. Artificial attempts to change the current state of the distribution would cause an increase of labor costs, because the capitalist would be forced to create more jobs for the same level of output.
1.4.3. Pro: Efficient economies boost production and consumption, but beyond a basic quality of life an individual's happiness is mostly determined by non-material factors. If economic performance does not increase happiness we should curtail it.
1.4.3.1. Pro: A [75-year long study](https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/want-a-life-of-fulfillment-a-75-year-harvard-study-says-to-prioritize-this-one-t.html) came to the conclusion that good relationships are the most important factor to create sustainable and fulfilling happiness.
1.4.4. Pro: Working long hours is detrimental to one's health and encounters diminishing returns.
1.4.4.1. Pro: There is an [increased chance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10618741) of smoking, depression, drinking, and weight gain for men and women who work 35 hours or more per week.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Working over 39 hours a week was shown to have negative effects on [mental health](https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2017/02/study-links-working-more-39-hours-week-poorer-mental-health).
1.4.4.3. Pro: Many workers stay in jobs with unhealthy working conditions due to a tight job market. A UBI can alleviate this stress.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: When workers are more able to leave bad jobs it leads to bad employers having persistently high turnover rates. This creates more effective pressure on the employer to deal with their problematic power dynamics and mitigate stressful working conditions.
1.4.4.4. Pro: Working [5 hours](http://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/the-5-hour-workday-how-to-increase-productivity-by-working-fewer-hours.html) a day instead of 8 hours or more has shown to increase productivity, performance, and increased happiness.
1.4.4.5. Pro: Working [80 hours](https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-research-is-clear-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies) a week does not result in increased output. Thus, working long hours is unnecessary and at the expense of the employee.
1.4.4.6. Con: Additional income isn't necessarily a motivator for people to work less. Some people want to earn as much money as possible no matter what.
1.4.4.6.1. Con: People who want to work long hours are free to do so, even at the expense of their health, but a UBI would allow those who do not want to do so securely.
1.4.5. Con: Working less will result in fewer benefits, like health insurance or contribution pension schemes. Even with a UBI, these benefits are still a necessary safety net for employees.
1.4.5.1. Con: People who are no longer mandated to work can make up for these benefits through vocations and other individual ways of making money.
1.4.5.2. Con: The main beneficiaries of a UBI \(the poor\) do not have much in the way of health insurance or retirement savings anyway.
1.4.5.3. Con: A UBI serves as a safety net for these employees. The income from their UBI payments can be put towards health care and retirement funds.
1.4.5.4. Con: Those benefits are not provided by companies for free; they just reduce the amount employees would earn from their salary anyway. It is unclear why working less would mean a drastic, rather than slight, reduction in those benefits.
1.4.5.5. Pro: Funds from a UBI are not likely to be enough to cover the rising costs of healthcare or emergency visits.
1.4.5.5.1. Con: In developed countries people on low-incomes do not typically pay for their own health care. Even in the US there are medicaid provisions and the [costs of emergency visits are passed on](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/who-bears-the-cost-of-the-uninsured-nonprofit-hospitals).
1.4.5.5.2. Con: A UBI could increase in line with an index that tracks the cost of living \(including healthcare\).
1.4.5.5.3. Pro: Emergency visits in the US on average cost [$1,233](http://blog.bcbsnc.com/2014/04/5-emergency-room-myths-busted/). This would take a substantial amount from the monthly UBI payments to cover.
1.4.5.5.3.1. Con: The state is not covering the cost of this care for the vast majority of people under the status quo anyway.
1.4.5.6. Pro: As some people are more likely to get diseases than others, they will be disadvantaged in terms of health care costs.
1.4.5.6.1. Pro: Some people who are for example ill, and depend on financial help, will need more than what a UBI can offer because they have large health-related expenses.
1.4.6. Pro: A UBI will allow individuals the opportunity to take fewer work shifts, giving them more time to pursue other interests they hold valuable.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Fewer shifts allows more time for children, family, and ensuring proper health outcomes. This leads to the development of healthy and meaningful relationships that better both a person's physical and mental health.
1.4.6.1.1. Pro: Supportive healthy [relationships](http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/the-health-benefits-of-strong-relationships) have shown to reduce harmful levels of stress that negatively affect the immune system.
1.4.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.4.6.1.3. Con: These precise outcomes can be achieved through something like an earned income tax credit for low-income individuals, without necessitating a UBI.
1.4.6.1.3.1. Pro: An earned income tax credit is also a lot more economically feasible, as it [costs less than a high UBI.](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/16/11948800/robert-greenstein-basic-income)
1.4.6.1.4. Pro: Additional time spend with children can reduce mental health problems of future generations.
1.4.6.1.5. Con: Work could be done in family businesses or at least with help of children in many cases, which would not only be good for relation, but also for the economy.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Reduced working hours allow more time for educational pursuits like earning a degree or taking classes in a subject of interest.
1.4.6.2.1. Pro: High and specialized education becomes increasingly important as more and more jobs are being replaced by machines, especially the lower-skilled jobs.
1.4.6.2.1.1. Pro: Between 2000 and 2010 the US lost 5.6 million [manufacturing jobs](https://www.ft.com/content/dec677c0-b7e6-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62) and 85% of these losses can be attributable to technological change \(mainly automation\).
1.4.6.2.1.2. Con: Moral-panic around increased mechanisation of the labour force has existed since before the industrial revolution, yet never actually come to fruition.
1.4.6.2.1.2.1. Pro: Overwhelmingly, technological advancements lead to job creation in other fields, due to increased net demand as a product of economic growth.
1.4.6.2.1.2.2. Con: This is not correct. [Current trends](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FOJ_Executive_Summary_Jobs.pdf) could lead to a net employment impact of more than 5.1 million jobs lost to disruptive labour market changes over the period 2015–2020, with a total loss of 7.1 million jobs.
1.4.6.2.1.2.2.1. Con: The very same study suggests that these losses can be offset by a ['talent revolution'](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FOJ_Executive_Summary_Jobs.pdf) whereby strong leadership from government and business elites leads to job creation in new fields.
1.4.6.2.2. Pro: With a UBI, people will have more income to easily afford more enjoyable educational experiences, like studying subjects within their interests or learning through world exploration.
1.4.6.2.2.1. Pro: People are more likely to have better lives if they have better access to education and enriching experiences than if they spend their whole lives trying to maximize their productivity in a capitalistic sense.
1.4.6.3. Pro: A UBI reduces the effective risks of working part-time or on a seasonal basis; allowing workers to better choose a schedule that suits their lifestyle.
1.4.6.3.1. Pro: Our time is the most important commodity we each possess; allowing us to better allocate it is important to self-determination and happiness.
1.4.6.3.2. Pro: People's living expenses are relatively constant costs — rent, food, etc are all must be paid for on a regular basis. When people do not work consistently the need for 'income smoothing' becomes burdensome and risky as people must carefully budget for how future costs can be met with irregular incomes.
1.4.6.4. Con: Incentives to work long shifts exist even under a UBI, and employers can design the system to their advantage. For example, employers might hand out promotions only to employees who work long shifts. Thus, low-income individuals are pressured into taking long hours in any case.
1.4.6.4.1. Con: Under a UBI, the vast majority of people will have the option to not work 12 hours a day, even when bonuses for long hours are in place. Thus, a UBI offers more individual choice, which is likely to be used by many workers, not just those with low-income.
1.4.7. Con: Most employees already have the option for working less by shifting to less demanding \(or part-time\) jobs. That most people choose to work full-time suggests they value a larger salary over larger amounts of free time.
1.4.7.1. Con: It is often not economically viable to work part-time. Part-time work does not always cover the cost of living.
1.4.7.2. Con: For many professions it is difficult to find stable, part-time work. The 5-day week is the de facto work pattern and is the pattern that most employment opportunities offer.
1.4.7.3. Con: Government programs, like benefits that only kick in after 40 hours per week,  strongly discourage part-time work. Restructuring to a UBI would help level the playing field between part-time and full-time work.
1.4.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.
1.4.7.4. Con: Part-time jobs benefit the employer more than the employee. They end up having the same or more hours of work by hiring multiple people and paying them less.
1.4.7.5. Con: A UBI would not keep anyone from working a full time job. It would give them the option of taking a lighter work week if personal time is something they also value.
1.4.8. Pro: UBI can liberate brainpower and thinking time, producing additional forward movement for society.
1.4.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.9.1.1.1.
1.4.8.2. Pro: With a UBI, many people would be less worried about money, and thus less mentally constrained.
1.4.8.3. Pro: People who receive UBI have more opportunity to search for meaningful and dignified employment than if they're struggling to survive; they can still be rewarded for their efforts.
1.4.8.3.1. Con: The only people who would 'benefit' are people who don't qualify for private charity, i.e. able bodied people who aren't looking for work.
1.4.8.3.1.1. Con: Private charity is overburdened, unable to keep up with the need of the groups it caters too, and is to unreliable to rely on.
1.4.8.3.1.2. Con: And people who are not technically unemployed or in need, yet are currently trapped in jobs or situations they would otherwise rather not be in, and are thus both suffering and performing less effectively since their work is not wholehearted and is stressful.
1.4.8.4. Con: People who have idle time due to UBI are not guaranteed to use it wisely. Without UBI people are guaranteed to use their brainpower to generate goods/services of value to other humans.
1.4.8.4.1. Con: Without a UBI, people are guaranteed to use some of their brainpower to generate goods/services. A stressed, forced worker will never be as productive as someone who does it voluntarily as a hobby and passion, without undue stress.
1.4.8.4.1.1. Con: Stress is in fact a strong motivator and often projects that are taken as a hobby or just for passion are abandoned or produce much less than projects that are produced unwillingly under stress.
1.4.8.4.1.1.1. Con: Stressed labour has physical and psychological costs that make it less productive in the long-term due to burnout, ill health, and resentment. Genuine motivation is far more sustainable.
1.4.8.5. Pro: Free time will drive people to work on personal projects - which will lead to an increase in innovations, allowing humanity's development to accelerate. Considering that each person has preferences for specific knowledge areas we can expect development in many forms.
1.4.8.5.1. Con: Perhaps, but there are other factors related to UBI which could cause the majority of humanity to simply spend more time enjoying themselves instead of working to improve. Artificial Intelligence would be one example.
1.4.8.5.1.1. Con: Likely true - but whether you view this as a negative or positive result is contingent on how you define benefit to society. 'Enjoying oneself' leads to happier, well-adjusted individuals with less aggravation and stress. A perfect personal climate to flourish curiosity-based learning and invention.
1.4.8.6. Con: Technological innovations and automation will lead to revenue being generated with less work, which will liberate brainpower and thinking time. Similarly to how hunter-gatherers have to spend most of their waking time in search of food, while modern humans can work for 8h per day and still have worked more than necessary for survival.
1.4.9. Con: A UBI, like welfare, denies our innate evolutionarily need to hunt and gather \(do work\). Humans that do not work are not happy.
1.4.9.1. Con: Work takes on various forms, as the people this would most directly effect are primarily physical labor. This frees them to perform more fulfilling tasks and allows automation to more readily take over such fields without casting many into poverty.
1.4.9.1.1. Con: Automation isn't all-pervasive, and will spread into different fields at different rates.
A UBI is a blunt and distortionary way of dealing with automation until such time as all fields are entirely automated, which may never happen.
1.4.9.1.1.1. Con: Automation can be all-pervasive in the near future and it can indeed spread into very different fields at a rapid rate. Waiting until this has happened before addressing the problem with a well considered and well implemented UBI may create great imbalances in existing power structures; creating social unrest at a massive scale as more and more people are pushed into poverty due to the lack of jobs.
1.4.9.2. Con: Humans are not bestial animals. Most people's reason to do work \(and feel good about it\) is either to do with survival, or a higher cause - whether it be providing for one's family, social status, profit as an end goal, profit to an end, or a genuine belief in the desirability and value to society of the results of one's work.
1.4.9.3. Con: Not all work is necessary. It would be at least equally correct to claim that the drive to say optimize transport by inventing the wheel was to reduce the need for work and effort, freeing up time for leasure.
1.4.9.4. Con: UBI does not deny this "innate evolutionary need", it only makes possible the choice of what kind of work the person desires to do.  The fact that there is no need to worry about surviving, people will be driven to work on whatever work field they want instead of working to attend to the desires of others.
1.4.10. Con: If the entire population works less on average, the amount of products and services generated decreases, decreasing overall wealth.
1.4.10.1. Con: Motivated people, that are not under stress, doing what they like, can achieve much higher production efficiency.
1.4.10.1.1. Pro: A UBI enhances working conditions.
1.4.10.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.4.10.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.3.
1.4.10.1.1.3. Con: Fewer workers means any spending to improve working conditions is less efficient. For example having to pay to make an entire factory safe for just one worker would create an impetus to find a way to circumvent having workers entirely.
1.4.10.1.1.3.1. Con: It is likely that any remaining humans in a factory setting, where the work is done by robots, would be in a supervisory/oversight function. This should be easy to ensure H&S as there would be little physical interaction with actual processes.
1.4.10.1.1.3.2. Con: Maintenance personnel would be necessary in any case, and a factory would have to be made safe for them. Providing safety in the event limited numbers of human workers are still required should not be so difficult as an extension for that. It is not like factories would otherwise be completely unsafe for humans to access.
1.4.10.1.1.4. Pro: UBI could help make employing and being employed more voluntary. If employment is driven by grave need, it becomes voluntary only in name.
1.4.10.1.1.4.1. Pro: There cannot be a free labour market without a UBI. When labour sellers are forced under pain of starvation to sell their labour to any available labour buyer there is no free choice and no free market. The labour buyers have no such urgency.
1.4.10.1.1.5. Pro: Competition would shift from businesses trying to entice consumers to buy products to trying to entice workers to help produce products. This would result in better wage competition.
1.4.10.1.1.5.1. Pro: It would also put pressure on excessive production of redundant products, thus forcing businesses that waste our resources out of the market.
1.4.10.1.1.5.2. Pro: A UBI will create a more competitive job market by allowing workers to be more selective of employment opportunities.
1.4.10.1.1.5.3. Pro: A UBI incentivizes employers to provide competitive pay and benefits for prospective employees, as employers would have to entice employees with more than just the promise of a basic living.
1.4.10.1.1.6. Con: Companies could use a UBI as a justification to offer lower wages.
1.4.10.1.1.6.1. Con: Companies do not need a justification to offer lower wages, the question is whether employees are willing to accept lower wages or not.
1.4.10.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: UBI would increase a low-skilled employee's leverage with prospective employers, and would also free workers to engage in efforts which might be marginally less profitable, but are also significantly more fulfilling or rewarding, such as creative endeavors or personally-preferred lines of work \(education instead of manufacturing; health care instead of construction; etc..\)
1.4.10.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: The wages might be too low to be worth the hassle of going to the job when all expenses are factored in \(education, driving...\). This could then lead to labor shortages.
1.4.10.1.1.6.1.3. Pro: The lower wages might not be enough to live on, even when combined with a UBI if either or both are too low.
1.4.10.1.1.6.1.4. Con: This is not only a question about employees, but employers too. Without stable employees working full-time, employers might not like lowering the wages of employees.
1.4.10.1.1.6.2. Con: Lower wages will improve productivity costs and increase production without affecting the general population income due to the UBI.
1.4.10.1.1.6.3. Pro: Companies are constrained in the current environment by people needed enough wages to, at the least, survive. If a UBI provides this level of subsistence instead then employment wages act as a marginal top up and can be offered at lower rates.
1.4.10.1.1.6.4. Con: Companies will still be restricted by their respective countries laws with respect to minimum wage.
1.4.10.1.1.6.4.1. Con: A UBI could allow the removal of the minimum wage if it were high enough, since it provides sufficient bargaining power to prevent exploitation.
1.4.10.1.1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.6.4.1.
1.4.10.1.1.6.6. Pro: The money companies save from providing lower wages might go towards automating jobs, which would reduce a person's sources of income.
1.4.10.1.1.6.6.1. Con: Lower wages could help both companies and employees transition to automation smoothly as it would function as an intermediary step instead of facing instant jobs losses.
1.4.10.1.1.6.7. Pro: This might be beneficial, as people could then buy products at lower prices. With lower purchasing power the price of general goods would need to adapt.
1.4.10.1.1.6.8. Pro: Lower wages could improve a company's image if the drop comes from higher-paid positions, as it will create more equality within it.
1.4.10.1.1.6.8.1. Pro: [US companies should limit CEO pay](https://www.kialo.com/time-for-a-maximum-wage-should-the-us-limit-ceo-pay-2141/2141.0=2141.1)
1.4.10.1.1.6.9. Pro: If a UBI takes place in the US, it'll resolve the US's issues with outsourcing jobs by remaining competitive internationally with nations that do not offer a minimum wage. The US companies could offer a similar wage as those given overseas. This will help US companies grow as well as provide more US jobs.
1.4.10.1.1.7. Pro: Decreasing the available workers would create greater labor shortages. This would result in an increase in pay for those who wish to participate in the labor force.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1. Con: Decreasing available workers and increasing wages, especially in combination with a UBI would cause prices, especially of consumer goods, to increase, possibly even in step with wages.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1. Pro: A UBI will lead to greater inflation.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.1. Con: The [increase of consumption](http://www.economicswebinstitute.org/glossary/cons.htm), as the largest GDP component, is great for the economy.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: Keynesian economists believe that higher inflation [promotes employment.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiswoodhill/2014/01/23/why-higher-inflation-is-a-very-very-bad-idea/#1823c2bc7e10)
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.1.2. Con: In case of the USA, a [stable dollar](http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiswoodhill/2014/01/23/why-higher-inflation-is-a-very-very-bad-idea/#191a89b37e10) was always better for the economy. The average real GDP growth rate is on its highest and the average unemployment rate on its lowest level in times of a stable dollar.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This argument already assumes inflation. In other words, there is the possibility of rising consumption and a stable dollar.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.1.3. Con: Inflation reduces the ability to consume more with each dollar.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.2. Con: There only is a [very limited positive correlation](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/05/20/higher-incomes-loosely-linked-to-more-spending-according-to-jpmorgan-chase-study) between changes in income and changes in consumption.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.2.1. Con: The researchers here are careful that the study would not infer macroeconomic trends \(inflation being a macroeconomic trend\). Those who already have a JPMorgan Chase account would not be those who go from being homeless to affording a mobile home, for example.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.3. Pro: Assuming the vast majority of citizens will not stop working, the UBI is an addition on top of their incomes. This leads to an increase in the amount of money in the national economy.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.3.1. Pro: In addition to that, a UBI also boosts the spending power of the lower class, which intensifies the mentioned effect.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.3.2. Con: A UBI would not create money from nothing, but rather reallocate who has it to spend.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: The [UBI](http://morganfoundation.org.nz/why-the-guardian-is-wrong-on-ubi/) is a redistributive transfer, it is not a cost to the government. Rather, it is a cost to some people and a benefit to others; thus the net cost is zero.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: It might not be a cost to the government, but it is an immense cost to taxpayers. Many people will have to pay a far higher tax-rate to pay for the large scope of the program.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.3.3. Pro: The price of a resource is set partly by consumers' ability and willingness to pay \(and partly by scarcity\). If you gave everyone on earth $1 trillion each tomorrow, the price of a loaf bread would rise to $millions, neutralising the effect. In states that offer unconditional housing benefit, landlords are able to demand at least the state benefit rate, causing average rent to climb. The net effect is a transfer of wealth from the state to landlords.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.3.3.1. Con: That would only be the case if every economic actor in this scenario started out with the same resources, so they would not be effectively richer. Now, when some have billions to begin with, and many have nothing \(or even less than nothing, debt\), it would bring new economic actors into play.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.3.4. Con: That is not a great assumption. There will be people who earn a small amount at something they strongly enjoy but have a side job to make ends meet. There will be mothers who would take time off they would not have taken to have children.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.3.4.1. Con: No reason is given why the majority of people would leave.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.4. Con: Demand is what creates jobs. Inflation is more-complex than simple demand.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.5. Con: It would require an insane level of inflation to occur for the benefits of a basic income to be strongly mitigated. [There is no evidence such inflation would occur.](https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7)
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.5.1. Con: Even if the level of inflation under an implemented UBI was moderate, it might still be high enough to render the implementation of a UBI less efficient to a family than other models of welfare.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.5.2. Pro: UBI payments can be indexed to inflation.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6. Pro: A UBI will raise the general demand in a national economy as citizens would have more available income that can be used [for consumption and investment \(saving\)](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~webfac/wood/e100b_f08/consumption.pdf). This process will lead to a higher price level and [thus inflation](http://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2002/october/inflation-factors-rise/).
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.1. Pro: It does appear that UBI would increase aggregate demand, then indirectly increase inflation as per [demand-pull inflation](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/012005.asp).
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.1.1. Con: This would only be the case in a scenario where offer was inelastic \(either because goods are too expensive to produce, thus unenforceable, or already at peak production, because all the land and resources are already destined to other more important products, making opportunity cost too high\), otherwise it would respond to the expansion in the consumer market by producing more, effectively offsetting inflation
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.2. Con: This would only be the case in a scenario where offer was inelastic \(either because goods are too expensive to produce, thus unenforceable, or already at peak production, because all the land and resources are already destined to other more important products, making opportunity cost too high\), otherwise it would respond to the expansion in the consumer market by producing more, effectively offsetting inflation
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.3. Pro: There is, by now, considerable evidence that consumption appears to respond to anticipated income increases \([Jappelli, Pistaferri, p.502](http://web.stanford.edu/~pista/ann_rev.pdf)\).
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.3.1. Con: To say people would consume more based on their income is, beyond plain obvious, not the same as saying such an event would cause inflation.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.3.1.1. Con: [Increased spending results in inflation.​](https://www.economicshelp.org/macroeconomics/inflation/causes-inflation/)
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: This is not a universal law, it is only the case in scenarios when the offer is bounded and inelastic; either because it is impractical to produce a good or because it is already being produced at maximum capacity where because  every land and resource is being directed at more important productions the opportunity cost would be too high. This is certainly not the case with a UBI because the offer could respond to the increase in the consumer market with new economic actors.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.3.1.1.1.1. Con: In the short term supply is inelastic. It takes time for the market to react, and the market reacts primarily due to the greater incentives provided by increased prices.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.3.2. Con: This point is only valid in that the transition to UBI could be inflationary. It does not speak to long term inflationary trends once it is implemented.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.4. Pro: A UBI will increase income, which in turn increases demand \(for better housing, better products, better foods, etc.\) which in turn leads to higher prices. Thus, the benefits of a UBI will normalize out within a few years — back to where we started, where a segment of the population falls at the bottom of the affordability scale.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.4.1. Pro: To give people a minimum amount of money without taxing others would inflate the money supply, and with such inflation comes increased prices, as more dollars chase the same number of goods and services in a society. And with increased prices, an increased minimum will be required to compensate.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.4.1.1. Con: A UBI would be paid for through taxes. The money supply would only inflate if the UBI were paid for through printing money, which is not core to UBI policy.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.4.1.2. Con: But in fact others should be taxed, especially those activities putting pressure on the system that make it harder and harder for people to find jobs \(e.g.  automation and AI-related activities\).
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.4.2. Con: The UBI rate can grow in response to changes in the cost of living. [These problems have been faced, and dealt with with other welfare programs.](https://www.ssa.gov/news/cola/)
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.4.2.1. Con: The impact of UBI will be much larger than existing welfare programs. So the cost of living adjustment will need to be quite large. That will add to the inherent infinite growth tendency of the market system: a UBI increases cost of living which increases in turn the UBI.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.4.2.1.1. Con: This may indeed be a factor, but these same forces have the possibility of waging wages at a similar rate, while this, all together may well create an environment where saving is less favorable, which is different, it's hard to say it will damage the economy, or people's lives all that much. Lacking more data, it's hard to say for certain which of these two theories is more right.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.4.3. Con: This argument seems to suggest that we should neither increase income, nor demand for better housing/foods/products, as increasing this demand would result in normalization and pricing out. Aside from pinning UBI to inflation as a remedy, \(and the [work demonstrating](https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7) that this does not occur, as both Alaska and Kuwait experienced decreases in inflation after UBI implementation\), the premise that increasing both income and demand for better housing/foods is a bad idea, seems quite misguided.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.4.4. Con: While increased income may increase spending and increase inflation, it does not have to, per se. If supply rises equally as a result of higher demand, the price of a product 'should' not rise, thus no inflation.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.4.5. Pro: UBI will not only create more inflation, but it will create a positive feedback loop. UBI will cause inflation, which will raise the cost of goods and services, which will lead to raising the UBI. Rinse. Repeat.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.5. Pro: UBI payments enable many more citizens to acquire real estate, as they have a higher income and easier access to credit. This process leads naturally to increasing prices for property, until the new standard price is reached and the purchasing power of their UBI payments are nullified.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.5.1. Con: The combination of purchasing power and freedom from work would enable people to live where they want, not where they must, normalizing the topography of house prices over land area.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.5.2. Con: Any time wages rise, there is inflation, but it is less than the increase in wages, giving a net positive gain. A UBI works like an increased wage in the economy, even if it is unearned.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.5.2.1. Con: The introduction of a UBI is of different quality than a mere increase of wages: A UBI affects the whole population \(citizens and/or residents\); A UBI provides a significantly higher amount of money compared to an average increase of wages; A UBI is permanent and therefore allows future planning irrespective of the labour market's situation.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.5.3. Con: That argument presupposes that offer would be inelastic, but it would actually respond to the increase in market demand, and production would be more substantial, for more people would be economic actors and able to buy, therefore offsetting inflation.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.5.4. Con: This wouldn't increase inflation, It would just increase house prices - and only in areas where supply is not meeting demand \(eg major western cities, the UK etc\)
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.6.6. Con: The hand that provides the resources for UBI will be the same hand that taxes the economy to generate the revenue. UBI is redistributive in its principle, so what purchasing power you take from one you given to another. Ignoring the intricacies of exactly how consumer goods markets will adjust, the net impact on inflation is likely to be neutral. Furthermore, successful implementation of UBI will require coordination between fiscal and monetary policy authorities.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7. Con: Inflation happens already, it is necessary to drive the incentives to continue to work rather than sit and stock pile cash. As inflation does occur, the amount of UBI given needs to increase over time; but this is an ongoing and healthy cycle.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.1. Con: If producers and landlords are expecting a UBI increase based on the last year's inflation, \(in the same way they already predict other things, like a Fed rise in the prime lending rate\), producers will accelerate inflation by anticipating these changes and adjusting their prices in advance.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.1.1. Con: The business adjustment argument was made against moving from the gold standard. We transitioned from the gold standard without issue.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.1.1.1. Con: This example does not reflect the conditions surrounding the implementation of a basic income. A change to fiat currency did not redistribute money. A basic income would. This changes people's spending habits much more than predicted inflation. With a large redistribution, a rich man does not buy a yacht, and the poor man buys a washing machine. There are many more people who are in the latter category than the former category.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.1.2. Con: This would only be true in the case of goods/services where demand significantly outstripped supply; in other areas, market forces would keep prices low as different suppliers competed wih one another for business. The big problem in the UK would be housing, but this is already a problem with the current welfare system and needs its own solution.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.1.2.1. Con: This is dependent on how powerful brands are in that industry, the cooperation/cartelization among those market participants, and how quickly new market entrants can respond to such demand signals. For a good with lots of proprietary technology, such as microchips, that may be a significant period of time.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.1.2.2. Con: Saying housing is a problem without a solution yet does not remove it as an area of potential friction. Negative externalities - in any policy change - must be taken into account by any reasonable legislator.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.2. Pro: Inflation is necessary, and the important question here would be "how much"?[Sigh of relief from inflation](http://www.investopedia.com/news/us-inflation-hits-fouryear-high/?ad=dirN&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&qsrc=0&o=40186)
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.2.1. Con: Inflation is not necessary. A good argument could be made that money ought to grow at the rate of the population growth, but the 2-3% target is far too much.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.2.2. Con: Even if inflation arrives at a moderate and expected pace, not all people can equally adjust to this. Someone with a fixed income would be at a loss vs someone with an accumulation of financial or real estate assets. Inflation takes from some and gives to others unfairly.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.2.3. Con: Unexpected inflation distorts behavior and creates mal-investments, increased market risk, and lower future growth.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.2.3.1. Pro: For example, inflation creates incentives to spend more in the present and save or invest less in the future, as returns are eroded by the declining real value of money.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.7.3. Con: Inflation happens but is not necessarily given; price inflation is a result of an increasing monetary supply, increasing propensity to spend, or decreased production. To propose that any of these instances will naturally occur in an economy and so can be accepted as a result of a welfare plan is fallacious.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.8. Con: Luxuries may be marginally priced out, but necessities wouldn't be. Especially given that both Alaska and Kuwait experienced [decreases in inflation](https://medium.com/basic-income/wouldnt-unconditional-basic-income-just-cause-massive-inflation-fe71d69f15e7) after versions of UBI were implemented, and that UBI is not additive but redistributive \(further mitigating fears of potential inflation\).
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.8.1. Con: It may be redistributive, but wealthier people save more as a percentage of total assets. Any change to that would increase the total cash in economy and therefore inflationary pressures.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.9. Con: A dubious fear of inflation is not an adequate reason to continue allowing poverty. There must be a stronger imperative than the fear of, or harms caused by, inflation.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.10. Con: Real world case studies suggest this is not the case. In [a study in Mexico giving out cash even had a lesser effect on the market than giving out necessary goods](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/20/16256240/mexico-cash-transfer-inflation-basic-income). In this case food.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.11. Con: Current economic challenges are [too little inflation, not too much](http://www.investopedia.com/news/us-inflation-hits-fouryear-high/?ad=dirN&qo=investopediaSiteSearch&qsrc=0&o=40186).
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.11.1. Pro: Inflation can be countered through monetary policy. Interest rates are currently too low, as is inflation. Generating inflation would be good for the country, and interest rates could be raised to counter any risk of hyperinflation.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.12. Con: The amount of price inflation from giving money to the poor is less than the amount of income inflation they experience.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.13. Con: Inflation would only occur if the money supply was increased to pay for a UBI.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.13.1. Pro: Because a UBI is a redistribution plan, the amount of money that people have is, on aggregate, the same. Therefore, consumption will not increase.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.13.1.1. Con: [Redistributing money](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/04/better-economic-growth-when-wealth-distributed-to-poor-instead-of-rich) to the poor likely increases goods sales as the poor spend proportionately more of their income on consumables than on savings.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.13.1.1.1. Con: This is not because poor people consume more, but because they earn less. If they would earn more, it is likely that they could save more of their income as well.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.13.1.1.1.1. Con: Lack of financial security is often a barrier to achieving the better work that allows this. A safety net would allow people to take more calculated risks and self-development to finding better work.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.13.2. Pro: The [Quantity Theory of Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money) states that inflation will only happen if money supply increases. With UBI, aggregate money supply in the economy does not increase, it just redistributes money from one part of the economy \(the rich, specific industries, specific economic activities, etc., depending on how the UBI was funded\) to the public.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.13.3. Con: Besides the quantity of money \(which affects general inflation\) the relocation of money creates localised inflation too. See for instance university costs in USA: as more money was made available for university costs \(loans, etc.\) the costs then soared way beyond that of general inflation. A UBI would create localised inflation rendering the income payments useless.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.13.3.1. Pro: An equal influx of money to all the population would create severe localised infaltion in consumer goods such as food, transport, housing, etc. as the purchasing power of everyone is shifted upwards.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.13.3.2. Con: An UBI would indeed cause some localised inflation, but it's impossible to make sweeping statements on whether they would offset the costs.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.13.3.3. Con: There's a critical difference between a UBI and the money made available for higher education: the latter is specifically purposed \(which logically increases the risk of inflation\) and the former is not. It allows people to spend the money on a large variety of things, greatly lowering the risk/amount of inflation.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.13.4. Con: Inflation for individual products will increase faster for products generally bought by UBI recipients. Overall across all products inflation may remain the same.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.14. Con: Efficiency created by automation will offset inflation.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.15. Con: The amount of inflation that UBI causes may not be much because it's aimed at getting people out of the poverty line. Net recipients of UBI transfers are going to be spending mostly on basic needs and thus have minimal effect on the money supply.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.15.1. Con: Not all goods are meat and potatoes. There are goods the poorest don't utilize which have constrained or sluggish changes in supply, such as housing.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.15.1.1. Con: This would only add to the monetary stress for those items, not divert money from them to goods that would grow the economy.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.15.2. Con: Assuming what UBI transfers will be spent on is hearsay - one doesn't know and can't decide for others what that money will be spent on and it's just as plausible that the money could be mis-spent, requiring yet another safety net for those who waste their UBI.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.15.2.1. Con: Giving even more money to people who will misspend it is redundant, as that money will also be misspent. Education is what is needed in those cases.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.16. Pro: An universal basic income doesn't guarantee the access to basic needs as inflation can eat away the purchasing power, specially if basic needs like health and education are paid for and market regulated. It's better to provide free public services and subsided housing, food, among others.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.16.1. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.5.2.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.16.2. Pro: Why not giving basic resources and services instead \(housing, internet, food, etc.\)? It will cost less, because of economies of scale, but it would decrease the GDP.
[www.independent.co.uk](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/universal-basic-services-idea-better-basic-income-citizens-social-housing-ucl-a7993476.html)
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.16.3. Pro: The two most common proofs for this proposition in the U.S. are education and healthcare. Both sectors are heavily subsidized and entitled; both sectors have seen steep [price inflation](https://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.reuters.com%2Fdata-dive%2Ffiles%2F2013%2F12%2FCPI.gif&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.reuters.com%2Fdata-dive%2F2013%2F12%2F17%2Fus-inflation-flat-historically-low-and-still-below-the-feds-target%2F&docid=VYwuC7J9zbkFQM&tbnid=qMIcT_Mx5KiiFM%3A&vet=1&w=700&h=615&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim) far in excess of the consumer price index for inflation.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.17. Pro: UBI would make the value of said basic income the new zero. If everyone has wealth, no one has wealth because the base value is whatever the least of us has.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.18. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.3.1.1.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.19. Con: In an era of accelerating technology, we should see negative pressure on inflation, meaning UBI could be funded by central banks printing money, a kind of QE for UBI. The great benefit of this is that if this assumption about inflation proves wrong, the policy could be stopped. It could also be phased in gradually, tested, and evaluated to see if the policy leads to inflation before increasing it.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.20. Pro: An economy is an allocation of resources, and money is just a signaling device and abstract store of value. Because a UBI simply distorts values and the signaling function, it cannot be effective in causing a permanent reallocation of resources, the only real justification for a UBI.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.20.1. Con: As a UBI is funded by taxation, it can facilitate a wealth transfer from the wealthy to the poor.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.21. Con: UBI will only have an effect on inflation if it is set so high that demand outstrips the ability of the labor market and natural resources to meet that demand. It will likely have only a modest effect on inflation. Of course, until a basic income is truly universal, we can't know what the real effect on the economy will be.
1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.21.1. Pro: In most cases, supply can rise to meet increasing demand, undercutting any inflationary pressure. The obvious exception is real estate, but a UBI will allow more people to migrate away from concentrated population centers because they are no longer dependent on the jobs there. This will effectively reduce demand for real estate, countering any inflationary pressure. Renewable energy will counter the inflation of fuel prices.
1.4.10.1.1.8. Pro: The rise of [freelancing](http://www.afr.com/business/small-business/future-of-work-how-the-freelance-revolution-is-changing-the-meaning-of-a-day-job-20140508-jyw7q) and [casualisation](https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2014/oct/17/the-casualisation-of-australias-workforce-is-nothing-to-panic-about) of the workforce is eroding the stability and financial security provided by full-time employment.
1.4.10.1.1.8.1. Con: Freelancing and casualization are indicators that people as a whole are now more capable of providing for themselves in the market than they were previously.
1.4.10.1.1.8.2. Pro: With the recent buzz of the [gig economy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryalton/2018/01/24/why-the-gig-economy-is-the-best-and-worst-development-for-workers-under-30/#7cc41d876d76), especially for younger people, a UBI would help these people get enough money until more stable work comes along.
1.4.10.1.1.8.2.1. Pro: Since the Great Recession, people do not have much choice with jobs, so people should not be punished for something out of their control \(a rough job market\). A UBI corrects for this issue.
1.4.10.1.1.8.2.2. Con: A 'worker stipend' \(money that fills in where the gig work lacks\) would be better for the economy, as it is less wasteful. It can target people who need the money the most rather than give everyone money whether they need it or not \(like a UBI\).
1.4.10.1.1.8.2.3. Pro: The issue with the gig economy is that it is a [large part of the workforce already and is expected to get bigger](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/the-gig-economy-2020-freelance-workforce-predicted-to-rise-to-43-cm803297). A UBI will help the economy prepare for that scenario.
1.4.10.1.1.8.2.4. Pro: Since [20 million gig workers would prefer a full-time job that they cannot find](http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/27/news/economy/gig-economy-workers/?iid=EL), a UBI would help them greatly.
1.4.10.1.1.8.2.5. Pro: Since the [gig economy is bad for the economy as a whole](https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryalton/2018/01/24/why-the-gig-economy-is-the-best-and-worst-development-for-workers-under-30/#7cc41d876d76) in the long term, a UBI may resolve the issues that the gig economy present.
1.4.10.1.1.9. Pro: With the insurance of a UBI acting as a safety net, workers can challenge their employers if they find their conditions of work unfair or degrading.
1.4.10.1.1.9.1. Pro: This serves as a check against the leverage typically held by employers. They now have a greater economic reason to ensure that their workers are satisfied.
1.4.10.1.1.9.2. Con: New ways of maintaining the power imbalance between the employer and the employee will be found.
1.4.10.1.1.9.2.1. Pro: The imbalance of power serves to increase productivity, as hierarchical management serves to guide and govern workers with a centralized system of rules and goals.
1.4.10.1.1.9.2.1.1. Con: It is morally abhorrent to use the threat of making someone jobless as a negotiating tool.
1.4.10.1.1.9.2.1.2. Con: The imbalance of power could also create antagonistic relations between employee and employer, which diminish productivity.
1.4.10.1.1.9.2.1.3. Pro: [Proper management techniques](http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2014/01/20/8-common-causes-of-workplace-demotivation/2/#390e499cf401) like rewarding success and addressing low performance increases overall motivation and productivity.
1.4.10.1.1.9.2.1.4. Con: This argument sounds very similar to the one used to justify slavery. Slavery is wrong.
1.4.10.1.1.9.2.2. Con: The power inbalance would be shifted towards the worker with a UBI, any countereffect on behalf of the employers is a seperate issue that could be argued in chicken-egg like fashion as the countereffect to the countereffect takes place.
1.4.10.1.1.9.2.3. Con: It would still increase the difficulty for the employer in maintaining said power imbalance, which is beneficial for the employees.
1.4.10.1.1.9.3. Pro: With a UBI in place, the power imbalance shifts: employment will be less of a necessity for some, making it easier to bring unfair treatment, wages, or working conditions to light.
1.4.10.1.1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.3.
1.4.10.1.1.9.5. Con: Walking away is often too little, too late. For example, an unsafe workplace is often only exposed through serious accident. Proactive government intervention is better than retroactive employee action.
1.4.10.1.1.9.5.1. Con: Proactive government intervention can still continue even if a UBI is implemented.
1.4.10.1.1.9.6. Con: Everyone but the most poor have adapted to living beyond the meagre means offered by a UBI. This means that the income that an employer offers still affords them a large amount of power over employees.
1.4.10.1.1.9.6.1. Con: They can adapt to living on less just as much as they've adapted to living on more.
1.4.10.1.1.9.6.2. Con: Even so, the threat of losing your luxuries is not as grave as the risk of losing provision for your basic needs, or having to rely on welfare system that are not always certain or reliable, and often stressful or stigmatizing.
1.4.10.1.1.9.7. Pro: UBI gives workers more power at the negotiating table. The choice is "work or don't have extra benefits" instead of "work or starve."
1.4.10.1.1.9.7.1. Pro: Currently many workers hesitate to speak up for fear of losing their jobs and their family's livelihoods.
1.4.10.1.1.9.7.2. Pro: UBI allows less skilled workers to negotiate pay and working conditions with employers fairly, rather than from a position of desperation.
1.4.10.1.1.9.8. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.3.
1.4.10.1.1.9.9. Pro: A UBI would make wages depend less on bargaining power, and more on skill requirements and effort.
1.4.10.1.1.9.10. Pro: UBI helps employees make the decision to not go to work sick. Then customers feel better that they are not going to get sick as often and employees don't worry about infecting others. So many benefits can incur from savings in costs, lives, and jobs.
1.4.10.1.1.9.11. Pro: A UBI would make it easier for unemployed people to get back on their feet and rejoin the workforce without having to find ways to cope with debilitating poverty in the meantime.
1.4.10.1.1.9.12. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.9.7.2.
1.4.10.1.1.10. Pro: A UBI allows people to take the time to look for better jobs.
1.4.10.1.1.10.1. Pro: Having this time to find suitable work will stop the "revolving door" effect, where people on benefits are forced to take a job, hate it, and quit shortly thereafter, becoming a burden on the welfare system.
1.4.10.1.1.10.2. Con: The additional time that people take to look for jobs would result in reduced time spent performing productive labor.
1.4.10.1.1.10.3. Pro: More time gives citizens a greater chance to find a job close to their current home and social environment \(family, friends\), which has a positive effect on their quality of life.
1.4.10.1.1.10.4. Con: A UBI will make citizens very picky and demanding concerning their job choices. Some positions and jobs would be very hard, next to impossible, to staff.
1.4.10.1.1.10.4.1. Con: It is the companies' duty to create incentives in order to staff their positions.
1.4.10.1.1.10.5. Pro: People stay in unsatisfying jobs because they are afraid of losing their healthcare benefits. With the UBI, people can better afford to fund their own healthcare and be less tied to any given job just for the benefits.
1.4.10.1.1.10.5.1. Con: That is only true for systems where public universal healthcare is not provided and therefore can easily be solved by implementation of that, without need of a UBI.
1.4.10.1.1.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.
1.4.10.1.1.10.7. Pro: In the US, only 30% of workers feel engaged in their jobs; [leading to a likely cost of around $500 billion a year](http://screenwerk.com/2013/06/25/gallup-70-of-workforce-not-engaged-costs-billions-in-lost-productivity/).
1.4.10.1.1.10.7.1. Pro: Productivity [increases](https://www.fastcompany.com/3048751/the-future-of-work/happy-employees-are-12-more-productive-at-work) when people enjoy the work they do. This can have a positive effect on the economy.
1.4.10.1.1.10.8. Con: UBIs threaten corporations that depend on salaried employees that earn 100% of their income from them.
1.4.10.1.1.10.8.1. Pro: A UBI could lead to increased employee turnover because their reduced dependence on a salary enables them to quit at the slightest dissatisfaction. This hurts companies, and then in the long run, the economy.
1.4.10.1.1.10.8.2. Con: If a business can't survive paying a fair rate to it's employees, it shouldn't exist in the first place.
1.4.10.1.1.10.9. Pro: Taking renumeration to make ends meet out of the equation will also allow people to only pursue what is of interest to them. Counter-intuitively, the biggest impact will be in the job market, as [workplace efficiency was studied and known](https://www.emergenetics.com/blog/workplace-appreciation-gratitude/) to be proportional to the psychological effects of workplace appreciation & gratitude.
1.4.10.1.1.10.10. Pro: UBI means less direct marketing - door to door sales and cold calling. Most people only take these jobs when they are desperate and have no other option.
1.4.10.1.1.10.11. Con: This is not a feature unique to a UBI. It is something that targeted unemployment benefits manage to achieve quite well under the status quo.
1.4.10.1.1.10.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.12.
1.4.10.1.1.10.11.2. Con: While unemployment benefits help people seeking full time employment, they generally provide a disincentive to finding part time work, as reporting this work means losing part or all of their benefits for that period.
1.4.10.1.1.11. Con: When people no longer need to work in order to improve their economic circumstances, governments are less likely to legislate on worker protections.
1.4.10.1.1.11.1. Pro: If there are comparatively fewer worker protections, this will further incentivize people to stay unemployed.
1.4.10.1.1.11.2. Con: This is only a problem in the short term. As time passes, companies have to create new protections and regulations  in order to appeal to potential employees.
1.4.10.1.1.11.3. Con: If companies, or governments, do not establish worker protections, then employees are less likely to want to work for those companies. This could spur an increase in automation in order to meet unit demand, which would in turn would further necessitate a UBI so products can be consumed.
1.4.10.1.1.11.4. Con: The government legislates worker protections because of its duty to protect citizens. This duty is not erased if the way citizens interact with work changes.
1.4.10.1.1.12. Con: The sheer cost of a UBI would reduce economic growth and thus decrease wages and increase unemployment. This gives employers more power to exploit employees.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1. Pro: A UBI has negative effects on the national economy due to effects such as inflation and higher tax rates.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3. Con: A UBI better rewards low-paid jobs. That has a positive influence on the economy, as well as on society.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.21.3.3.5.2.4.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.2. Pro: As some companies cannot afford to pay high salaries, a UBI works as a subsidy. It helps the affected companies, e.g. start-ups, to develop and expand.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.2.1. Con: On the other hand, a UBI can be misused by employers as an excuse for low salaries.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.3. Con: There are more direct ways to improve this. A free market will appropriately compensate for the skill of labor given time to work out kinks. Labor laws and unions provide incentives to pay individuals just compensation. A job that pays more than it produces has a negative effect on the economy.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.3.1. Con: There are many perverse factors and market failures that currently prevent the free market from working effectively as it should.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.6. Con: A UBI is actually probably worth just as much as those low paid jobs; thus it wont change a thing for people who want to contribute to society without receiving a universal benefit.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.6.1. Con: A low-paid job provides the same financial incentive to work and contribute to society whether a UBI exists or not; a UBI actually makes it more likely because benefits are not withdrawn when becoming employed.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.12.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.7. Pro: A UBI could help with space exploration where the economy has physical limits. Space explorers will need funding for setting up extraterrestrial civilization but have less opportunities to work \(not many options in a space capsule or a planet with no people\). Or they can support their family on Earth through a UBI.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.8. Pro: UBI would achieve more employment in jobs that are necessary, while reducing conformity to unnecessary and wasteful employment because it allows us more freedom to choose our fields of work.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.8.1. Pro: People would be more apt to choose work that they believed to be important rather than just working for a paycheck.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.8.2. Pro: UBI would allow people less fear of unemployment to be able to do work that they are good at, rather than just working for a paycheck due to having less fear of losing their income.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.8.3. Pro: UBI would allow people less fear and freedom to discover the work that they are good at, that being their talents.  Thereby, better accommodating a wider and differing range of personalities.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.8.4. Pro: As population growth occurs, and times change, the number of different personalities will also increase. UBI better allows for the accommodation of these different personalities via reducing unnecessary conformity.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.9. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.7.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.10. Pro: As people become enabled to work less it will also enable them to spend more time volunteering, or offering their professional skills to causes they care about.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.11. Pro: A UBI would increase the demand for products and services people actually need \(e.g. housing, education, healthy food, health care\) but could not afford otherwise; resulting in a more efficient society-wise use of resources.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.4. Con: Giving the poor a higher baseline income allows them to better participate in price signalling \(relative to the middle/upper classes\) and [thus better drive demand for inexpensive but high-quality goods](http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/2016/04/22/the-unconditional-basic-income-and-the-hayekian-price-system/) that improve their lives.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.4.1. Pro: Conditional grants \(such as food vouchers\) are a mechanism that force consumer choice towards particular goods and services, rather than a market-driven aggregation of individual preferences. Allowing consumers more agency over how they acquire goods more efficiently directs the market to provide the goods and services that individuals actually value.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.4.2. Pro: A UBI would facilitate a more democratic capitalist society by providing all citizens with sufficient funds to 'vote' for the companies they want to exist through the purchasing of products and/or services. This informed consumption would provide a greater flow of capital to companies that meet the wants of the greater population forcing companies to adapt or be replaced. This is in contrast to a wealthy elite defining the direction and ethos of companies and thus the economy.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5. Con: UBIs increase the productivity of individuals.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.1. Pro: [One reason](http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/12/opinions/schulte-leisure-productivity/) for low productivity is that people are unable to enjoy the benefits of the money they earn through their labor, since they have no time. A system that allows people to actually enjoy their life means that they are more productive at work, since they are more relaxed.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.1.1. Pro: This argument is [empirically supported](http://www.forbes.com/sites/elenabajic/2015/08/25/take-a-vacation-to-boost-your-productivity-at-work/#3a27c02c6955) by statistics in countries with more days for vacation.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.1.1.1. Con: There is no evidence that this is a causal relation as opposed to a simple correlation. It is possible that countries with the highest productivity can afford the most days for vacation.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.1.2. Pro: This is especially true in places where the cost of living is particularly high, pushing many workers to take on extra hours or additional jobs, which further reduces their access to leisure time away from work.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: This is can be found in the Hawaiian culture through the notion of "[living aloha](https://www.cbrigham.com/living-aloha-and-pono/)," which advocates building up the local community in order to maximize time spent with family in order to combat the negative effects of the lack of leisure time.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.2. Pro: People who do not work out of financial fear are [more productive](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/what-if-everybody-didnt-have-to-work-to-get-paid/393428/).
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.2.1. Con: The biggest motivation for me to earn a paycheck is the fact that if I don't work, I starve. If I don't work, I don't have a place to live. If I don't work, I can't support a family. If all of that were covered by a UBI, and my only motivation to work is extra "me money", then I am far more likely to do sub-par quality work or even quit because I don't need that job.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.2.1.1. Con: Most people would prefer not to be in that situation. We should therefore be working to avoid forcing anyone into that situation, rather than justifying it.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.3. Con: A UBI doesn't decrease societies overall workload. Only innovation does that.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.3.1. Con: It may help to redirect society's production in directions more genuinely valued, rather than forcing people to accept any job they can obtain, as current society does.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.4. Pro: Today, lots of people are unfit or unwilling to do their jobs, but need those jobs to get through the month, while lots of willing and ambitious people are sitting at home, searching for a job. With UBI, one could leave a job they are not happy with and still survive while searching for something else. In doing so their post could be taken by someone ambitious, which would lead to a further boost in productivity.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.5. Con: UBI is a productivity killer, in the sense that it gives incentives to things different than value-driven activities \(be it straight to the point corporate work, sports or arts production\). Society reached our level of complexity due to its incentives structure, changing this so broadly is, to say the least, risky.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.5.1. Con: We've changed social structures many times before: 'society' used to be only monarchs and lords who owned everything.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.5.2. Con: We have the ability to do controlled experiments of both size, and scale to see how this policy will effect us.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.5.2.1. Pro: [Finland](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/finland-universal-basic-income-experiment-lesson-tips-ubi-poverty-unemployment-a7871441.html), and many other countries, are already experimenting with a UBI under controlled conditions to rigorously determine its effects.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.5.3. Con: There is more to life than "productivity" and "value", and if there is no time to use and enjoy the utility we create, it is valueless.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.6. Pro: [Evidence](http://behavioralscientist.org/wisdom-universal-basic-income/) suggests UBI is good from a psychological well-being and productivity perspective.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.6.1. Pro: Current welfare systems induce a psychology of fear of ['earning too much'](http://reason.com/reasontv/2016/03/03/the-human-cost-of-welfare-how-the-system), which can hinder the potential for self-reliance and economic growth. A UBI would remove this fear, as it is not dependent on one's earnings.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.6. Pro: The effectiveness of UBI depends on the culture. In cultures that prize hard work a UBI will inspire greater work. In cultures that do not prize hard work \(say, [Saudi Arabia](https://www.forbes.com/pictures/eihg45gjhg/saudi-arabia-4/#574f01de7ae3)\), most of the actual work will have to be imported from outside.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.6.1. Con: It's not so easy to measure cultural laziness / work ethic. Saudi Arabia, for example, is a more difficult place to find work as it is usually defined.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.6.2. Con: Using Saudi Arabia or any other country that have to deal with physically crushing heat during the day that curtails daytime work outside of the confine of a well air-conditioned enclosure is not a fair example. This fallacy is too often and erroneously used to make cultures from hot country appear to be lazy. It is true however, that necessity is the mother of invention, thus people living in a harsh and scarce environment have a higher incentive to innovate.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.7. Con: A UBI guaranteed to any citizen of a country would allow its government to foster liberal economic policies without throwing people into economic and social insecurity.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.7.1. Pro: For example it could create regulations to the effect of allowing for more flexible jobs and hence some air for the businesses \(especially the small and mid sized ones\) or for creating a greater freedom of choice for individuals to choose their professionnal path.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.7.2. Pro: A UBI could remove the need for a regulated minimum wage and allow companies to hire lower skilled, lower experienced or lower productive workers at appropriate rates.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.6.4.1.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.7.4. Pro: A UBI, although a band-aid for the current economic model \(capitalism\), this temporary phase, could be just enough to be a stepping stone towards a more sustainable economy.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.9. Pro: The [Saudi Arabian](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2016/10/03/saudi-government-budget-cuts-prove-basic-income-is-no-solution-to-slow-economic-growth/#1376eff54bbe) government provides its citizens with payments comparable to a UBI; however its economy \(outside of oil production\) is undeveloped.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.9.1. Pro: The Saudi government employs around two-thirds of [Saudi nationals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2016/10/03/saudi-government-budget-cuts-prove-basic-income-is-no-solution-to-slow-economic-growth/#4a0dcedb4bbe) in make-work jobs that provide a steady and reliable income regardless of an individual's productivity. Despite this free and unconditional source of income, people do not do more than required or use their free time for other productive activities.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.9.1.1. Con: The Saudi system \(as depicted above\) is a poor example since it's neither here nor there. UBI isn't about 'making fake jobs', its purpose and spirit is to free people up to live lives that are meaningful to them.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.9.2. Con: The Saudi economy is undeveloped because the sheer size of the oil economy means that no other forms of industry and services are necessary.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.9.3. Con: The Saudi economy is undeveloped because archaic social norms prevent half the population working, and normalise a lack of effort in the other half.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.9.3.1. Con: There is no evidence that women not working normalizes a lack of effort in men. Japan is a case and point in a male-dominated yet workaholic culture.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.9.3.2. Pro: Smart women in the workforce is better for the economy than smart women not in the workforce.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.9.4. Con: Providing make-work schemes to the general populace is not the same as a UBI; it is more similar to 'work-for-the-dole' schemes and suffers from the same problems: that forcing people into meaningless tasks is less efficient than allowing them the freedom to self-improve or produce value independently.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.9.5. Con: This payment is far from universal when you consider it is not available to [the 30%+ portion of the population who are foreign workers](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sa.html).
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.9.6. Con: Saudia Arabia's economy has not suffered because of its UBI. Its GDP per capita is [comparable to the United States](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita)'.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.9.7. Pro: Saudi Arabia's economic woes have less to do with their welfare spending, and more an over-reliance on oil which proved to be their Archilles heel. The Saudi case says less about UBI, and more about the need for economic diversification.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10. Pro: There are a multitude of jobs that need to be filled that are not economic and that are also minimum wage, such as bush regeneration, farm labour or factory hand etc. It is possible that providing a UBI could potentially decrease the incentive for workers to take jobs that are unappealing and/or uncomfortable.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.1. Con: If those low-skill jobs are fundamental, but increasingly attract fewer workers, the jobs will then require higher wages until their attractiveness reaches an equilibrium.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.1.1. Pro: Many factories and warehouses pay double federal minimum wage for entry level. It isn't about the pay, it's about the culture of people not willing to work with their hands and get them dirty. It's about the culture that only office work is good work, and that actual labor is beneath the common man.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.1.2. Con: The equilibrium you talk about is bankruptcy for many small businesses that can no longer afford a waiter, a cleaner, or a dishwasher. This simply plays into the hand of well established businesses and makes the barrier to entry much higher for anyone looking to start something new.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.2. Pro: A UBI is currently not sustainable as there would not be enough incentives for people to work in jobs which are fundamental to society, but unattractive \(e.g. garbage disposal\).
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.2.1. Con: When considering a UBI as a future solution, many of these types of jobs could be performed by machines, thus rendering low-skills employment unnecessary for humans.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.2.1.1. Con: Replacing fundamental jobs such as garbage disposal with machines is not, as of yet, a viable solution.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.2.1.1.1. Con: Technological development has increased a lot: we are about to make driving a useless human skill. People seems to underestimate the potential of the AI; we are just a few steps from a new industrial revolution.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.2.2. Con: If these jobs are truly fundamental, the compensation for them will increase to a new equilibrium.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.3.1.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.2.3. Con: Jobs that are fundamental to society should not be unattractive - for example, garbage disposal doesn't have to be so unattractive. If we all learn to reduce, reuse, recycle, compost, etc, there is not much left to dispose of. Some ancient societies built their homes in midden piles.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.5.4.5.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.3. Con: A UBI will decrease the supply of low-skilled workers. This dynamic will be counteracted by rising wages \(in low-skilled jobs\) and a surge in Automation \(to replace lost workforce\). A UBI therefore acts almost like a pigouvian tax on low-skilled work \(similar to a minimum-wage\).
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.4. Pro: A UBI would most likely mean workers subsidizing low wage jobs.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.5. Con: These jobs are not taken because they do not pay enough for someone to live on. And these jobs are better done with automation.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.5.1. Con: Some jobs are not currently possible to automate. Others are not economically feasible to.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.6. Pro: If there are any menial jobs that cannot be automated, it will be difficult to arrange to have them done. Menial labor, if not motivated by necessity or by the hope for better opportunities, doesn't have what little appeal it had in the first place.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.7. Con: A UBI will force businesses to pay workers fairer wages, particularly for menial jobs less people want to do, since it will reduce the amount of people looking for this type of work and leave it to the employer to attract workers \(with higher pay, more rights etc.\).
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.10.8. Con: A UBI does not need to be set so high that everyone is satisfied, only enough that their needs are met at a minimal reasonable level.  Anything beyond that would still require a job.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.11. Con: -> See 1.3.21.3.3.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.12. Con: A UBI makes everybody economically "productive" by giving them money to spend on goods and services, thus driving demand.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.12.1. Pro: UBI will stimulate the economy, as wealth scarcity reduces cash flow. UBI will improve cash flow and thus encourage people to spend more freely, especially those who work and educate for extra wealth privileges.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.12.2. Pro: This also has benefits on the supply side, as when people cannot buy enough goods, it prevents the need for [government intervention due to market failures](http://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/College/marketfailures.html), as a UBI would prevent them.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.12.3. Pro: In a world where automation is going to remove more jobs than it will create, a UBI will be needed to ensure the  liquidity of money still has value. Otherwise, money will be hugely devalued to a point much worse than stagnation/devaulation and right or left wing politics of today which are focused on the creation or redistribution of wealth become irrelevant to the masses and lead can to a population with no sense of purpose except for day to day survival; leading to a rise in Fascist beliefs.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.12.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.21.3.6.1.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.13. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.4.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.14. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.15. Con: Widely respected economists, such as free market capitalist [Milton Friedman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM&t=50s), were in favor of a basic income guarantee in the form of a negative income tax and saw it as having positive effects on the national economy. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman#Social_security.2C_welfare_programs.2C_and_negative_income_tax)
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.15.1. Pro: Having a UBI for 8 years will grow the USA GDP by 2.5 trillion dollars. [www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/31/1000-per-month-cash-handout-would-grow-the-economy-by-2-point-5-trillion.html)
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.15.1.1. Con: An increase in the GDP is not in itself a good thing, especially when it just seems to be "more money is spent" \(as the study seems to suggest\); one must link to how quality of life is affected by a change in the economy.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.15.1.2. Con: The linked study makes multiple questionable/disputed assumptions.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.15.2. Pro: A study shows that UBI would grow the economy. [www.vox.com](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/30/16220134/universal-basic-income-roosevelt-institute-economic-growth)
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.15.3. Con: Friedman preferred no welfare at all, and simply thought an equal payment to all would be more efficient than payments dependent on income level. That implies he would not support massively increasing welfare expenditures to institute a UBI. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman#Social_security.2C_welfare_programs.2C_and_negative_income_tax)
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.15.4. Con: Friedman reiterated these arguments 18 years later in Free to Choose, with the additional proviso that such a reform would only be satisfactory if it replaced the current system of welfare programs rather than augment it.[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman#Social_security.2C_welfare_programs.2C_and_negative_income_tax)
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.15.5. Con: It's inaccurate to claim Friedman supported a UBI. Negative Income Tax is very different from UBI in that UBI gives everyone the same check regardless of means or a change in circumstances, whereas NIT is predicated on how far off from a pre-determined level of income the recipient is.[Milton Friedman on Negative Income Tax](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=milton+friedman+negative+income+tax)
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.16. Con: People tend to [spend less and save more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift) when there is no security net. The economy would be better of having people circulating their money back into society.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.17. Pro: A universal basic income would cause marked reductions in productivity while increasing public expenditure, harming the economy.
1.4.10.1.1.12.1.17.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.7.
1.4.10.1.1.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.4.10.1.1.12.3. Con: Much of the money that would go into a UBI is already being spent on other programs. The net cost may actually be lower.
1.4.10.1.1.12.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.3.1.2.
1.4.10.1.1.12.4. Con: UBI would likely have a growth effect on the market by putting money in the hands of the impoverished, who statistically spend it most readily.
1.4.10.1.1.12.4.1. Pro: Black Americans have low [saving rates](http://thepowerisnow.com/savings-rate-of-african-americans/). Thus, money received would be channeled into the economy directly.
1.4.10.1.1.12.4.1.1. Con: As the [source](http://thepowerisnow.com/savings-rate-of-african-americans/) states, the most likely reason is that Black Americans do not earn enough to save. The money paid out to them might give them a chance to save.
1.4.10.1.1.12.4.1.1.1. Con: Much of the money received may have to go to [debt settlement and other expenses](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/debt-black-families/409756/), with very little going into savings.
1.4.10.1.1.12.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Even just clearing existing debts is a starting point for savings - when income is no longer eaten up by interest fees on debt, individuals can begin to save.
1.4.10.1.1.12.4.1.1.2. Con: The money paid out to them would be taken from someone else, who would as a result save less than before. Moreover, the money paid to them would not be enough for them to create savings, otherwise they would not need it urgently, and the UBI would not have been enacted.
1.4.10.1.1.12.4.2. Con: Increased spending means decreased saving, and therefore less capital construction. This makes society less wealthy in the long run.
1.4.10.1.1.12.4.2.1. Con: More capital is constructed rather by re-investing than by keeping saved money-based capital. Saved capital is out of the market for all the time it stays saved.
1.4.10.1.1.12.4.2.1.1. Con: Money that is saved in a bank or other financial institution is not out of the market, but instead is now accessible to most anyone who wants to borrow. Money saved "under the mattress" does not contribute to economic growth, but is a negligible portion of all savings. It also plays an important role in the security of low income households \(which are most likely to practice it\).
1.4.10.1.1.12.5. Con: Poverty is very [expensive](https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21663262-why-low-income-americans-often-have-pay-more-its-expensive-be-poor). Not having a UBI is more expensive than a UBI. Economic policies that create jobs are very expensive if we're creating those jobs mostly as an excuse to provide people with incomes.
1.4.10.1.1.12.5.1. Pro: The increase in economic contribution from those lifted out of poverty by UBI could be greater in many cases than the cost of providing those individuals a UBI.
1.4.10.1.1.12.6. Con: A UBI decreases the importance of wages and those who feel they are capable of living on the UBI will drop out of the labor market. This in turn decreases unwilling unemployment and increase the demand for labor.
1.4.10.1.2. Pro: There is an overriding presumption which suggests money is the only cohesive motivator to unified productivity. We use communism as the example, but that flawed system poisons other post-scarcity-like imaginings. It is difficult to prove, but is entirely conceivable that a UBI-floored system could foster more productivity and motivation.
1.4.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.
1.4.10.3. Con: Money is not the only factor that creates jobs. Freedom and creativity can create jobs often in spite of a lack of resources.
1.4.10.4. Con: -> See 1.4.7.5.
1.4.10.5. Con: In the 50's the [labor participation rate](http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/515ec6526bb3f73375000008-1503-1127-620-/labor-force-participation-rate-march.png) was 6-8% lower than currently, but the economy was good and income equality was much lower. With the gains in productivity we've achieved, everyone could live comfortably with fewer workers.
1.4.10.6. Pro: Society relies on economic productivity to tax and fund programs, such as welfare, education and healthcare. While people individually might be better off if they worked less, it would lead to less tax revenue and harm society overall \(even if those programs were replaced with a UBI\).
1.4.10.6.1. Con: Tax systems can be re-evaluated, corrected and improved to account for the effects of a UBI.
1.4.10.7. Pro: UBI is not a long term solution. Even in a situation where it is perfectly collected and distributed it would only work while the amount of working individuals out number the amount of individuals collecting UBI. There is a tipping point were the system would be unsustainable.
1.4.10.7.1. Con: That tipping point may not be reached due to other incentives to work.
1.4.10.7.2. Con: There could not be more people working than receiving - a universal income is universal. It may well be that there are more people making a net contribution than receiving a net income, once taxes, etc, are allowed for, but again this is not a given - there need to be enough people producing that they can meet the needs of the economy as a whole, but this is not just a matter of raw numbers of people, but of resources as a whole.
1.4.10.8. Pro: The point of a UBI is supposed to be that it doesn't disincentivise work. If it does, then it is flawed in the same way that welfare is; it's a distortion that leads to less work and hence less real wealth.
1.4.10.8.1. Con: If you define "incentivize work" as any lawful mechanism that makes people work more, then abolishing slavery disincentivized work. Any semblance of power \(aka more money, less unemployment\) that you give to the worker will also give them the ability to say no to work they don't need to do. You don't want to optimize for wealth created alone.
1.4.10.8.2. Con: Hours worked are subject to diminishing returns. At one point, working one hour more might be less beneficial overall, than for example resting. In fact, it's possible for a worker to be more productive spending that hour doing something that he is intrinsically motivated to do, like spending time with children, making food, cleaning at home etc.
1.4.10.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.7.1.3.
1.4.10.9. Con: A decreased working population pushes industry towards automation and higher incentives to attract workers within a more competitive market.
1.4.10.9.1. Pro: The amount of products and services that were generated will still be produced, only now under sophisticated automation, whether this will decrease overall wealth is dependent on the decisions and discussions surrounding wealth distribution.
1.4.10.9.1.1. Pro: Automation is expected to reduce more jobs than the jobs it will create, so we will propably need to find a way to work less and maintain a good standard of living. A UBI might be one of them.
1.4.10.10. Pro: This is the biggest issue facing the US economy today. Productivity IS down to where it was during the great recession. This is the biggest reason for low or no economic development in many sectors of the economy and subsequent stagnation of income.
1.4.10.11. Con: With automation progressing as it is, businesses will be able to produce the same output without having to pay as many employees \(or allowing employees to work fewer hours\) giving them a higher profit or higher wages. This will lead to some degree of increased wealth.
1.4.11. Con: Working, in general, should not be seen as a bad thing. The emphasis of government policy should be to improve our working life; not nullify it.
1.4.11.1. Con: Work takes time that can be otherwise used on good things, so unless it can be shown that it is valuable, it should be treated as a bad thing.
1.4.11.1.1. Con: The value of work can be determine by the amount paid for it. So only charitable work, in some cases, may be treated as bad work. Any other is valuable by default.
1.4.11.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.
1.4.11.2. Con: Even if work was a good thing, it is unclear why it should take the priority it currently does over other uses of time.
1.4.11.3. Con: We work quite a lot. It is unclear if it maintains any value and represents a good use of time given the amount of time we currently devote to it.
1.4.11.3.1. Pro: There are many jobs which are widely acknowledged as ["make-work" jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make-work_job).
1.4.11.3.2. Pro: We spend 8 hours sleeping, probably at least 1.5 hours eating, 8 hours working, and around 1 hour commuting to and from work, all of which only leaves us 5.5 hours to actually live, create, or better ourselves at a maximum. It is hard to argue that social lives, self discovery, personal growth, and enjoyment are all so subservient to the 'duty' or 'responsibility' that is work.
1.4.11.4. Con: A UBI does not necessarily devalue work. It does give people a chance to find work they find intrinsically rewarding as well as financially. Particularly if they have lost a job to out sourcing or automation.
1.4.11.5. Con: Work is not necessarily a good thing. Most people hold jobs that are not rewarding, stimulating, or interesting.
1.4.11.6. Con: Working in itself may or may not be a bad thing, but the problem is when we are working more than is necessary/optimal. In the future, we very likely will be able to increase the efficiency of our work—decreasing the time required to work.
1.4.11.7. Pro: We define work in this discussion as a negative, but there are millions of options for "work" that are not only positive, but enjoyable.
1.4.11.7.1. Pro: Working in the creative or medical fields, teachers and professions dealing with children report [higher than average satisfaction with their jobs](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2015/03/08/cheat-sheet-happiest-jobs/24509095/). It boils down to liking what you do. Many people do things they don't like, so "work" becomes a pejorative, instead of the calling or passion that many people see it as.
1.4.11.7.1.1. Con: A UBI would not prevent people from taking jobs they find personally satisfying, and would in fact facilitate them to as they would not have to spend time and energy on jobs which are not satisfying or enjoyable to them, allowing them to devote this time and energy to training, searching for, and engaging in work which is. This would also increase worker engagement and effectiveness.
1.4.11.7.2. Con: -> See 1.4.11.7.1.1.
1.4.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.2.5.1.
1.4.13. Con: Only some groups of people actually need to work less — the overworked, those of ill health,  etc.
1.4.13.1. Con: Being able to work less is valuable to all people, regardless of need. Even if they do not take the opportunity, it works as a bargaining chip.
1.4.13.1.1. Con: What is worth for people is not for sure what is needed. If nobody would need less work, then they all would work same amount, so it would be nearly no change; or some would work less out of laziness or some other unimportant motivation and total production would suffer unnecessarily.
1.4.13.2. Con: The opinion exists that people are overworked in general in modern society.
1.4.13.2.1. Pro: The [United States](https://20somethingfinance.com/american-hours-worked-productivity-vacation/) often ranks the most overworked developed country in the world.
1.4.14. Pro: A UBI is the best way that we can arrive at the post-scarcity economy that advancing technologies have been promising since the dawn of the industrial revolution. If you want a future in which the average work day gets shorter because we have automation to do the work for us, you want UBI.
1.4.14.1. Pro: A UBI helps individuals to cope with the consequences of the [next industrial revolution](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/the-next-industrial-revolution/498779/) \(automation\) which could obliterate millions of jobs.
1.4.14.1.1. Pro: It has been estimated that [47% of US jobs are at risk of automation](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) in the next 20 years.
1.4.14.1.1.1. Pro: In 2016, 45% of [McDonalds](https://www.thestreet.com/story/13511123/4/mcdonald-s-rolling-out-self-ordering-kiosks-in-europe-will-u-s-be-next.html) restaurants in Europe rolled out in-store kiosks to automate the ordering process. While convenient, the kiosks take the place of jobs with raising minimum wage costs.
1.4.14.1.1.2. Pro: Even creative domains are at risk of being automated.
1.4.14.1.1.2.1. Pro: There is [software](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/this-news-writing-bot-is-now-free-for-everyone/) that generates texts and stories and it is already used by the Associated Press to cover [sports](https://www.poynter.org/2016/the-associated-press-will-use-automated-writing-to-cover-the-minor-leagues/419489/).
1.4.14.1.1.2.2. Pro: A supercomputer successfully created a totally AI based [movie trailer](https://phys.org/news/2016-09-supercomputer-world-ai-created-trailer.html).
1.4.14.1.1.2.3. Con: The current methods for creating art using an AI are based on pattern and rule recognition followed by recombination of preexisting data. Artificial Intelligence currently has no idea of context and cannot create art without specific human direction.
1.4.14.1.1.3. Pro: Fast spreading new [technologies](https://www.ft.com/content/dec677c0-b7e6-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62) like advanced robotics or 3D printing will obviate millions of low-skilled jobs.
1.4.14.1.1.4. Pro: In the [medical sector](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21700758-will-smarter-machines-cause-mass-unemployment-automation-and-anxiety) deep-learning systems are already more accurate than humans in classifying malignant tumors from CT scans, or wrist fractures from X-ray scans.
1.4.14.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.2.1.1.
1.4.14.1.1.6. Pro: A new software by JPMorgan \([COIN](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/jpmorgan-marshals-an-army-of-developers-to-automate-high-finance?cmpid=socialflow-facebook-business&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social)\) for Contract Intelligence is able to replace whole teams of lawyers and loan officers, interpreting commercial-loan agreements faster and with fewer errors.
1.4.14.1.1.7. Con: [Very few occupations—less than 5 percent—are candidates for full automation today.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Global%20Themes/Digital%20Disruption/Harnessing%20automation%20for%20a%20future%20that%20works/A-future-that-works-Full-report-MGI-January-2017.ashx) A surplus of human labor is much less likely to occur than a deficit of human labor, unless automation is deployed widely.
1.4.14.1.1.8. Con: The Frey and Osborne paper ["is a set of guesses with lots of padding to increase the appearance of 'scientific precision'.”](https://robotenomics.com/2016/07/28/new-research-fears-of-technological-change-destroying-jobs-may-be-overstated/) Researchers at the OECD analyzed the Frey and Osborne study and conducted their own research on tasks and jobs and concluded that: “automation was unlikely to destroy large numbers of jobs.”
1.4.14.1.1.9. Pro: ATMs are substituting bank employees worldwide, the same as Home-banking is: nearly all done via technology.
1.4.14.1.1.10. Pro: It is estimated that [4 million jobs](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hello-self-driving-cars-goodbye-41-million-jobs-2016-09-15) in the US will be replaced by self-driving cars over the next decade.
1.4.14.1.2. Pro: As many as [45 percent](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation) of the activities individuals are paid to perform can already be automated by adapting current technologies.
1.4.14.1.2.1. Con: Fewer than [5 percent](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation) of occupations can be entirely automated using current technology. Thus it is likely that positions will not entirely disappear, only the tasks and activities humans perform will change.
1.4.14.1.2.1.1. Con: Technological progress occurs rapidly and what is not possible today could very well be possible in a few years.
1.4.14.1.2.1.2. Con: As human-performed activities will be reduced, jobs will transform from full-time to part-time. This will result in lower wages and fewer benefits.
1.4.14.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: About 60% of all occupations could see 30% or more of their constituent [activities automated](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/where-machines-could-replace-humans-and-where-they-cant-yet) with today's technologies.
1.4.14.1.2.1.3. Con: Occupations do not have to be entirely automatable to result in significant job losses. An occupation that is, for example, 60% automatable, is likely to result in employers reducing their staff in that occupation by 60% and reallocating the unautomatable work accordingly.
1.4.14.1.3. Con: Technological innovations automatically cause [compensation effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment#Compensation_effects) that strongly mitigate their consequences.
1.4.14.1.3.1. Pro: In the past, [new technologies](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21700758-will-smarter-machines-cause-mass-unemployment-automation-and-anxiety) have always created more jobs than they have destroyed.
1.4.14.1.3.1.1. Pro: New technologies lead to increased productivity which in turn creates more wealth, cheaper goods, greater spending power, and ultimately more jobs.
1.4.14.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Whilst this is true, in the US, for example, average incomes have been relatively stagnant for the last 30 years, whilst the National wealth has increased significantly. Wealth creation has always been transferred to the already wealthy, with little benefit for the middle, and working class.
1.4.14.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This is untrue. From the mid 1800's until the mid 70s [productivity grew in line with real term wages.](http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/what-happened-to-the-wage-and-productivity-link/)
1.4.14.1.3.1.2. Con: [Automation](http://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2016/12/17/automation-has-created-more-jobs-in-the-past-but-will-it-now/#55efab0627fd) will not create new jobs like other technologies did.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The loss of jobs due to automation will dramatically reduce social mobility as most individuals' skills will be rendered obsolete — particularly those who perform menial work.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Automation](http://www.businessinsider.de/stephen-hawking-ai-automation-middle-class-jobs-most-dangerous-moment-humanity-2016-12?r=UK&IR=T) will accelerate the already widening economic inequality around the world as very small groups of individuals can make enormous profits while employing very few people.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Blaming technological change for inequality absolves the elites of their responsibility. Technology transforms production, but [power and politics determine](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/16/universal-basic-income-equality-tech-silicon-valley) how the dividends are distributed.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: As automation replaces human workers, it's likely something like this will be used to create a new serf class, and a new land owner nobility, essentially repeating the middle ages. In other words, as more people are unemployed, the government will use UBI to prevent uprising and civil unrest against the economic elite. This is very likely, but it is not at all a good thing.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: The exponentially accelerating progress in robotics and AI will inevitably result \(as we're starting to see already\) in the elimination of essentially all jobs and corporate shareholders reaping all the benefits. There are only two possible outcomes:  either we tax the corporate profits resulting from automation to provide a UBI, or there will be blood in the streets.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: An UBI can unleash the creative forces once the need for basic survival imperatives and creature comforts are removed. An infrastructure must be created to capitalize and support on creative, innovative surge in new paradigms. Industrial monopolies would represent a danger to this system.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: A storybook "[rags-to-riches](http://www.businessinsider.com/rags-to-riches-stories-2011-11)" career will become next to impossible to achieve.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: This is due to the production of digital technologies that [eliminate the need](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/531726/technology-and-inequality/) for many middle-class jobs.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Experts predict a "[jobless future](http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21700758-will-smarter-machines-cause-mass-unemployment-automation-and-anxiety)" as most jobs can be broken down into a series of routine tasks, more and more of which can be done by machines.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: According to [Stephen Hawking](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540), full artificial intelligence could supplant the human race.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.2.2. Con: The fact that a computer can do something better than a human being doesn’t mean that the computer will replace the human being. The market will determine whether it is economical to do so, given the costs and perceived benefits.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.2.3. Con: When machines replace one kind of human capability,[new human experiences and capabilities emerge.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2015/06/04/the-robots-are-not-coming/#574dc6131913) These might be mostly higher value and offer more interesting work than the experiences and capabilities that have been replaced by machines.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.3. Pro: The idea of automation and [artificial intelligence](http://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2016/12/17/automation-has-created-more-jobs-in-the-past-but-will-it-now/2/#33a8b61b23ae) is different than other technological inventions before as it merges the existing ideas of machinery, electricity and computing to something entirely new.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.4. Pro: General artificial intelligence will be able to learn at a faster rate than humans.
1.4.14.1.3.1.2.5. Con: Experts suggest that automation \(and AI\) will create more jobs than it will replace.  [www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/16/ai-robots-jobs-alphabet-eric-schmidt.html)
1.4.14.1.3.2. Con: However, some [economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment#Compensation_effects) have concluded that those compensation effects are reduced or, at least, need to be studied [further](http://ftp.iza.org/dp6291.pdf) due to new technologies such as computerization.
1.4.14.1.3.3. Pro: In Germany, there is a huge number of robot-intensive industries and a high degree of automation. However, this does not negatively affect [total employment](http://voxeu.org/article/rise-robots-german-labour-market).
1.4.14.1.3.3.1. Con: Although total employment has not been intensively negatively affected, [roughly 275,000](http://voxeu.org/article/rise-robots-german-labour-market) full-time manufacturing jobs have been replaced by robots in the period 1994-2014.
1.4.14.1.3.3.1.1. Con: As those significant losses in employment could be offset by job gains outside manufacturing, robots and automation only have changed the employment market's[composition](http://voxeu.org/article/rise-robots-german-labour-market), but not the total employment rate.
1.4.14.1.3.4. Pro: New jobs always replace old. We’ll need automation maintenance & improvement, and emerging resource production \(such as algenol farms and silicon & lithium mining\).
1.4.14.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.1.3.1.2.1.1.
1.4.14.1.5. Con: The loss of a fulfilling job cannot be compensated for by UBI payments.
1.4.14.1.5.1. Con: Having more free time enables people to instead have a fulfilling hobby they can choose more freely than a job.
1.4.14.1.5.2. Pro: People relying on external motivation to feel fulfilled where monetary  gain is an important factor might not feel as fulfilled if they no longer need this mechanic.
1.4.14.1.5.3. Con: The loss of a fulfilling job also cannot be compensated for by living below the poverty line.
1.4.14.1.5.3.1. Con: The idea that we need a job to be fulfilled, that we are not complete without one, is toxic on the face of it. It creates the internal, and external idea that the unemployed are bad people, and that retired people are incomplete, both obviously absurd, and harmful ideas. This idea is horrible, and we should do what we can to eliminate it.
1.4.14.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: This further leads to any number of insecurities and causes of depression, as well as furthering judgmentalism.
1.4.14.1.5.4. Con: Only [around half of jobs are satisfying](https://www.statista.com/statistics/224508/employee-job-satisfaction-worldwide/) so a UBI would relieve people of unsatisfying activities.
1.4.14.1.6. Pro: Automation and the increased use of technology [affects](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation) the whole socio-economic spectrum from low to higher-income professions.
1.4.14.1.6.1. Pro: UBI will become increasingly necessary as advances in technology render larger and larger portions of the population to be unemployable.  UBI would help us retain societal order, rather than mass unemployment causing chaos. [Humans Need Not Apply - CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)
1.4.14.1.6.2. Con: Policy acceptance is more dependent on perceived vulnerability than actual vulnerability. Insofar as most higher-income professionals do not view themselves at risk, they are therefore still unlikely to support a policy that they see as irrelevant to their interests.
1.4.14.1.6.3. Con: Executive-level jobs tend to rely on more transferable general management and administrative skills. It may be true that single-industry workers are most at risk of obsolescence if their factory closes down whereas professionals, managers, executives and technical occupations have comparatively less trouble transferring to a laterally-related field.
1.4.14.1.7. Con: The belief that machines and automation on net balance will create unemployment is an "economic delusion" \(see Chapter 7 on [mises.org](https://mises.org/library/economics-one-lesson)\).
1.4.14.1.7.1. Con: Our current society generously rewards the insights and creativity of intelligent specialists.
If machines become more intelligent, draw insights from an infinitely broader dataset of field specialized knowledge and offer just as creative solutions at a faster pace and a cheaper rate; then society will less generously reward the outperformed traditional specialists.
1.4.14.1.7.2. Con: The quoted source focuses on mechanical machines \(which reduce repetitive manual labour\), leaving out artificial intelligence \(which reduces routine and even non-routine cognitive labour\).
1.4.14.1.7.3. Con: The author passed away in 1993 while even many contemporary economists don't understand the implications of a machine defeating world champion go players. It would be very hard for an economist to lay down principles that apply to our ever faster changing economy without having witnessed the mass adoption of cell-phones nor algorithms dominating stock exchanges.
1.4.14.1.8. Pro: With experts predicting 47% unemployment by 2040, there is no way for the law of creative destruction to catch up. The great depression hit its height at 30%, and UBIs are the only feasible solution to keep money flowing through the economy while we adapt.
1.4.14.1.9. Con: [Creative destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction) is a natural economic transition; for example the invention and mass production of cars destroyed the horse and cart industry. Creative destruction forces people to refocus their skills elsewhere, thus encouraging innovation.
1.4.14.1.9.1. Con: Creative destruction of jobs is currently occurring \(e g. fossil fuels and auto industries\); however workers are turning to conservative politicians to keep their jobs open instead of moving to another industry or going back to school for new job training.
1.4.14.1.10. Con: It is too early to predict whether automation will actually take enough jobs that the economy couldn't support normal employment.
1.4.14.1.10.1. Con: Though we can't predict it with complete accuracy, there are observable patterns to follow. Not only can we vaguely see where technology is headed, we can observe the attitudes of various employers to new development to determine how employment is likely to rise or fall.
1.4.14.1.10.2. Pro: A future of massive job automation/displacement \(where new jobs aren't created, it's futile to retrain displaced workers, and indefinite unemployment benefits are their only hope to get by\) is extremely speculative/hypothetical at this stage. We should instead focus on optimizing our education system for the 21st century, so everyone \(all ages, all social classes\) have the opportunity to acquire in-demand skills...if jobs do become scarce, the "haves" must face fierce competition for those jobs
1.4.14.1.11. Pro: People without the high cognitive abilities \(e.g. because of their genetics\) required to do the remaining jobs will not be able to make a living.
1.4.14.1.12. Pro: UBI will balance out the missing consumption part of increased automation \(sadly robots do not have to buy anything\). Most western nations are heavily dependent on personal consumption for their GDP \(70% of US GDP comes from personal consumption\). UBI can provide for the missing consumption for the unemployed labor pool, while taxing owners of robots.
1.4.14.1.12.1. Pro: AI and automation are replacing jobs at a growing rate, leaving millions of capable people jobless with no alternatives. Even menial service jobs are becoming automated. A UBI would not only ensure the survival of the poor, it may become the only way to infuse cash into a high-unemployment economy.
1.4.14.1.13. Pro: As more labor is automated, there may be less work available to do for all, including many who want to work. Since the availability of paying jobs are unfairly distributed, the claim that those who are able to work are unfairly burdened with the needs of others is morally suspect. At the very least, the burden falls as much upon manufacturers who refuse to employ humans vs superhuman machines as it does on those who cannot find work.
1.4.14.1.13.1. Pro: In the near future, automation will increasingly displace human workforces. If the world still operates on a monetary system, these people will still need money, but jobs will be unavailable beyond automation maintenance and programming; everyone cannot do this, and everyone is not needed to do this. Thus, a UBI would allow economies to continue churning, while acknowledging the work done by automation on the human worker's behalf.
1.4.14.1.14. Pro: We can't predict the rate with which technologies such as AI could [evolve](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/). Having a UBI in place as soon as possible can contribute in having well prepared societies for that eventuality.
1.4.14.1.15. Pro: UBI democratizes the profits of automation.
1.4.14.1.16. Pro: UBI can address the negative impact of "creative destruction".  As new technologies displace older firms and their workers, income inequality between lower-educated and higher educated workers will grow with no short-term market solution.  UBI can remediate this growing inequality while preserving market-based incentives to pursue education and other means to greater productivity, if UBI is set high enough for basic subsistence and low enough to be unattractive as a stand-alone income.
1.4.14.1.17. Con: UBI ends up being duct tape for capitalism by mildly redistributing wealth in such a way as to render those with substandard living conditions complacent. It is like a robot tax, delaying the inevitable.
1.4.14.1.17.1. Con: The notion that capitalism is a major source of poverty is unproven. For rankings of present-day governments regarding degrees of political freedom and economic prosperity, see “The Human Freedom Index, 2016,” [object.cato.org](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/human-freedom-index-2016.pdf). Figure 7 shows Average GDP per Capita by HFI Quartiles \(Human Freedom Index\). And Figure 1, 2 show correlation between personal freedom and economic freedom.
1.4.14.1.18. Pro: A UBI would allow labor forces unemployed due to structural changes, e.g. technological improvement, to cope with the physical and mental transition in finding a new remunerating occupation/job.
1.4.14.1.18.1. Con: Existing welfare systems already do this in most countries.
1.4.14.2. Pro: A UBI will decrease the need to keep obsolete jobs open which can result in an improved focus on technology. For example: machines can take over a position with zero hardship to the employee losing said job. The UBI removes fear of \(and indeed financial impact of\) losing a position to technological improvements.
1.4.14.2.1. Con: UBI wouldn't remove *all* financial impacts of losing a job; presumably, even with UBI we still earn more with a job than without.
1.4.14.2.2. Con: The worth of having a job is not limited to mere financial aspects. There is a huge moral and psychological boost from having employment.
1.4.14.3. Pro: UBI is a logical outcome in a world with advanced and generalized robots, 3d printers, and solar panels allowing for nearly nearly free, widespread work and energy. Heretofore humans have been responsible for all goods and services made and transported. With machines, our productivity has exploded while costs for basic goods have dropped.
1.4.14.4. Pro: UBI is the only proposed solution to a near future where a large number of people can work and want to work but there is nothing economically useful for them to do.
1.4.14.5. Con: This is a Malthusian fallacy, claimed during previous economic changes, and giving rise to the Luddite movement that wrecked mills because it was putting weavers out of work. In fact what happened was people ended up doing jobs that simply did not exist, while benefiting from lower cost output.
1.4.15. Con: The right way to create an environment where people work less is by shortening the amount of hours required to work at a full-time position.
1.4.15.1. Con: Reducing hours without increasing wages \(or alternate income streams\) will simply increase poverty, inequality, and/or the prevalence of working multiple jobs.
1.5. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.12.1.
1.6. Pro: A UBI reduces inequalities and enhances social mobility.
1.6.1. Pro: Government-funded research and education is a key driver of innovation, yet its returns mostly accrue to the owners of capital. By helping to circulate wealth from the rich to the lower and middle classes, a UBI helps recapture this public investment for the public itself.
1.6.1.1. Con: Those who are wealthy already benefit from technological advancement as they are the ones who own the means of production. The government does not also need to provide them with a UBI, that is just double dipping.
1.6.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: The money paid out to the wealthy through a UBI will be offset through increases in progressive taxes.
1.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: A UBI can be combined with shifting taxing schemes from income-based taxes towards capital-based taxes, which would increase the liquidity of money and ensure that capital has a reasonable return rate while also forcing those who own capital to invest it in value-creating activities instead of just "sitting on it".
1.6.2. Pro: A hypothetical $12k UBI if implemented in the US would be [enough to reduce its Gini index](http://www.scottsantens.com/does-basic-income-reduce-income-inequality-gini) \(a measure of income inequality\) from 0.6 to 0.46; bringing it on par with that of the Nordic states.
1.6.2.1. Pro: A $12k per year UBI would cover a large portion of my survival expenses freeing up the time I presently use working to meet my basic needs, to do other more effective and self-actualizing things.
1.6.3. Pro: Unlike current welfare schemes, which only benefit the most disadvantaged in society, a UBI will benefit almost everyone by taxing those who have accumulated large amounts of wealth over a long period of time.
1.6.3.1. Pro: The income gap continues to increase between the wealthiest 1% and the rest of the population. A UBI would not only help close the gap, but would also all but eliminate the constant debate of a liveable minimum wage we've been having for over a decade.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: Resource distribution in society will always be unequal. A UBI or any other welfare scheme does not alter this fundamental reality.
1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: A UBI may not eliminate inequality \(and total equality may not even be desirable\) but it will help to prevent inequality from reaching levels which create suffering, and create a safety net for those on the "short end" of the "inequality stick".
1.6.3.2. Pro: Rawls vs. Nozick rears it’s head again! Intellectualism lost the argument to populist politics. Fundamentally though, any sane, right thinking person would support John Rawls philosophy of Distributive Justice. Rawls suggested that vast wealth accumulated by a small minority should be redistributed; after all the majority likely created it for the minority. As we head towards greater mechanisation via AI and more people loose their jobs, the vastly wealthy minority have a moral obligation.
1.6.3.3. Pro: Universal benefits such as child benefits and pensions have strong support among the populace \([Allahyar, p. 18](https://www.academia.edu/8447710/Universal_Basic_Income)\) due to their universality. Therefore it is fair to expect similarly strong support for a UBI.
1.6.4. Pro: Most advocates of a UBI emphasize that the fundamental basis of a UBI is equality in terms of opportunity, saying that “each person should have equal opportunity to pursue a conception of the good life” \([Allahyar, p. 8](https://www.academia.edu/8447710/Universal_Basic_Income)\). This would decrease inequality, rather than increase it.
1.6.4.1. Pro: It is difficult for the poor to improve their position without a basic safety net that provides reliable access to education and income. A UBI will provide this and help close the gap in equality of opportunity between the rich and the poor.
1.6.4.2. Pro: Experiments with UBIs [showed](http://qz.com/765902/ubi-wouldnt-mean-everyone-quits-working/) that teenagers put off getting part-time jobs to focus on school, leading to a noticeable decline in high school dropout rates in Dauphin, Canada, and to double-digit increases in high school completion among participating families in New Jersey, Seattle, and Denver.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.17.2.1.
1.6.4.2.2. Con: [Youth allowance](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/youth-allowance) fixes this same problem in a more targeted and efficient way.
1.6.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Equality is by its nature unconditional and recognized as a [human right](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/).
1.6.4.4.1. Con: No benefit can be guaranteed unconditionally to some without enforcing an unconditional obligation on others. Before distributing money as a UBI, all the money must first be collected, plus the overhead required to complete the redistribution process. When the cost of enforcing the transfer is included, UBI is negative sum and constitutes Legal Plunder, as defined by French economist Frederic Bastiat in his 1850 work, [The Law](https://mises.org/library/law).
1.6.4.4.1.1. Con: This assumes that all the production comes from human activities. This is already changing with automation and artificial intelligence, which would push most of the income toward activities which are not performed by humans and therefore removing one side of the equation defined by Bastiat.
1.6.4.4.1.2. Con: The idea that the UBI is always a negative sum does not take into account the fact that people with less money spend most if it, therefore it goes back into the economy. In contrast, much of the money from the top 1% is not put back into the economy since it is saved offshore, used to speculate in stock markets \(not natural market forces\) and to unfairly influence governments.
1.6.5. Pro: Capitalism has a tendency to lead to the accumulation of capital into the hands of a few \([Piketty, 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century)\) leading to an inevitable stratification of income levels and the collapse of the middle class. A UBI is a way to redistribute wealth, stimulating consumer demand and businesses.
1.6.5.1. Con: UBIs are akin to medieval indulgences, but for modern elites. They're meant to tamp down support for more fundamental reforms like land redistribution, or like reformulating the economic system to reward something other than immediate self-interest. Previous welfarist proposals have been lauded by reactionaries as "[saving capitalism](https://www.hoover.org/research/how-fdr-saved-capitalism)". UBIs work the exact same way.
1.6.5.2. Con: Capital accumulation is not reduced by a UBI. By increasing [reservation wages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_wage) and reducing the desirability of hiring workers, capitalists gain a justification to leave workers out of the market.
1.6.5.2.1. Con: A major redistribution between the population translates into a reduction of capital.
1.6.5.2.2. Con: By increasing the lowest wage which workers would accept, employers will expect workers to be highly competent and rigorous, stimulating work efficiency.
1.6.5.2.3. Con: Workers still need to be hired to fuel capitalism, so they cannot be left out of the market.
1.6.5.3. Con: Inequality can be reduced in less disruptive ways, such as by encouraging [inclusive growth](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDEBTDEPT/Resources/468980-1218567884549/WhatIsInclusiveGrowth20081230.pdf) and economic participation.
1.6.5.3.1. Con: Income inequality being reduced in less disruptive ways does not solve for the root cause of inequality, but it rather runs the risk to lead to worse conditions where individuals can still use income inequality to oppress individuals that have a lower standard of living.
1.6.5.4. Con: The effect of stimulating consumer demand is mitigated by the extent to which prices are raised by businesses.
1.6.5.5. Pro: Consumer demand isn't stimulated when individuals do not have the autonomy to spend how they wish. With a UBI, individuals can finally choose what to invest in.
1.6.5.6. Pro: When robots take over the jobs, people will still need money to buy the products robots are making. A basic income is a great idea because people have more free time to start a business or become an artist or what ever and start earning more money with the things they like to do in life, this way more money will be created for the government by paying taxes on the extra income they create!
1.6.5.7. Pro: The profit employers make by effectivization tends to go to people with an already high standard of living rather than employees which are in more in need of the profit - which could be implanted through fewer working hours with sustained monthly wage. The free market's inability to deal with this calls for wealth-distribution measures, such as a UBI.
1.6.5.8. Pro: UBI allows those, who previously had no capital, to participate in capitalist endeavours of enterprise. This is preferable than being excluded from it and forced to rely on others because of their lack of opportunity.
1.6.6. Pro: Property rights and capital ownership are community assets. Individuals with no property or capital need to be compensated by those who are hoarding these assets.
1.6.6.1. Pro: UBI mediates between the natural right of every human to a part of the earth and its natural resources and the liberal concept of individual ownership of those goods.
1.6.6.1.1. Pro: A UBI is a small step towards remedying the exceedingly imbalanced distribution of wealth generated with Earth's resources.
1.6.6.2. Con: Property rights are community assets but capital and property itself are not community assets. Control of natural resources \(e.g. land, water, spectrum and air\) belongs to the entire society which then sells temporary rights for exclusive use to individuals. Private property is a natural, inalienable right that is not granted by society. Everyone has at least some property; their body. We trade our labor to acquire more property. Our property is not a community asset unless we are slaves.
1.6.6.3. Pro: A UBI is not the redistribution of income from those who earned it to those who did not. A UBI is the redistribution of accumulated wealth from those whose ancestors hoarded it to those whose ancestors have provided the labor and intellectual capital which has created that wealth seance the end of the stone age. A UBI is not a handout, it is inheritance from all of your ancestors for 10,000 years.
1.6.6.4. Con: There is nothing communal about property rights. Only individuals can own things. Even corporations and the government are reduced to individuals when presented as legal entities.
1.6.6.4.1. Con: While it's true that only individuals can own things, property rights are not "things" by any common definition of the word. For example, an individual might hold a copyright on a book but it's a temporary right granted for a limited time by society. Nobody can actually own the story because an idea is not a "thing". Likewise real estate rights are not things. They are a temporary right granted by society. If there is no community, then there are no property rights, there's just property.
1.6.7. Pro: UBI is possibly the most cost effective solution for addressing homelessness, poverty, and crime as the overall cost is less than the cost of policing, medical care and lack of opportunities induced by poverty.
1.6.7.1. Con: Universal Basic Income would not completely address economic inequality because it would not change the fact that at least some higher end services and goods would be too expensive for somebody on such income to afford such as private health insurance.
1.6.7.1.1. Con: Universal health care would not require a health insurance for basic health services.
1.6.7.1.2. Con: The desire to have access to luxury products and higher end services are still good incentives for work.
1.6.7.2. Pro: A UBI is a proactive approach to preventing abject poverty in the population, and proactive approaches are typically superior to reactive approaches. Studies have demonstrated significant anti-poverty benefits from the implementation of a UBI.
1.6.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.3.
1.6.7.4. Pro: A UBI would enable those who have lost their jobs to recover more easily and allow them a better quality of life.
1.6.7.5. Pro: An UBI prevents a major rise in poverty in times of financial crisis.
1.6.8. Pro: Only a UBI can guarantee that every person is provided the basic amount of resources needed to survive.
1.6.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.
1.6.8.2. Con: Alternatively, basic resources could be provided in-kind \(government-issued food, health care, shelter\). A UBI is not the only way to accomplish that aim.
1.6.8.2.1. Con: To be provided in-kind by the government would require a much higher cost due to the increased bureaucracy than simply giving people the money to do this themselves.
1.6.8.2.2. Con: This would limit the services able to be accessed by lower income people to the government supplied and would remove the free market advantages and personal choice
1.6.8.2.3. Con: This would provide a similar stigma to current government programs such as 'food stamps'
1.6.8.3. Pro: Society expects individuals to be clothed, fed and housed. These cost money. It is preposterous to expect individuals to clothe, feed and house themselves without providing the means to do it.
1.6.8.4. Pro: A UBI provides security, allowing people to focus on long-term goals instead of their next meal.
1.6.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.
1.6.8.5. Con: Each person's basic amount of resources needed can vary, especially when it comes to healthcare. A person may still be precluded from required, costly medical treatments if the UBI is not high enough.
1.6.8.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.5.
1.6.8.5.2. Con: In many developed countries, healthcare is free at the point of need. In others, UBI would enable more people to afford health insurance. Even though UBI will not solve every problem, it may still be much more effective than current systems.
1.6.8.5.3. Con: The UBI money would still provide part of the healthcare cost, thereby making the rest more affordable. It would be much better than nothing.
1.6.8.6. Con: Supplying basic resources does not guarantee happiness or contentment.
1.6.8.6.1. Con: True, but a lack of basic resources guarantees ill health and intense stress that prevents someone from persuing the endeavours that do make happiness and contentment more likely.  See [Maslow's heirarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#Hierarchy).
1.6.8.7. Pro: Universal Basic Income would allow everyone the opportunity to survive regardless of their ability to work and/or skills, training, etc.
1.6.8.7.1. Pro: Without work for income, one must resort to begging or theft to survive. If one is unable to even do those things, they would surely perish.
1.6.8.8. Pro: Capitalism is predatory by nature and requires poverty. One cannot be on top if there is no one at the bottom.
1.6.8.8.1. Pro: The US is the richest nation yet we allow resources to end up in dumpsters rather than give them to those who need them to survive. Further, waste is necessary in order to control the costs of production and market value.
1.6.8.8.2. Pro: When citizens have more money than can possibly be spent in several lifetimes, ending poverty is a question of morality, not resources.
1.6.8.9. Con: A UBI does not guarantee that for every person; only every citizen. The aim of welfare should be to provide every resident, including non-citizens, with the means to fulfill their basic needs.
1.6.8.10. Pro: UBI frees individuals from the constant worry of keeping their heads above water. This liberation from survival-mode encourages positive economic education, familial stability and increased joy. The psychic costs of a lifetime's survival  must be accounted for, and remedied.
1.6.8.10.1. Pro: It also encourages increased perspective of - and contribution to - the bigger picture and bigger-picture issues.
1.6.8.11. Pro: A UBI will give the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in society a little bit of housing security, which many have never had.
1.6.8.11.1. Pro: We are in "winner takes all" societies. Top performers capture a disproportionate share of the value created. In many professions, such as those related to arts, sports, or entertainment, there is a long tail of people which can't afford basic needs such as housing.
1.6.8.12. Pro: According to the Center For Poverty Research UC Davis \([poverty.ucdavis.edu](https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-current-poverty-rate-united-states)\) the poverty rate in the U.S between 1959 to present day fluctuates between 22%-11%. This constitutes millions of people struggling to eat and live. If we had a UBI in place people would ultimately be inclined to focus on other social issues instead of the struggle to 'make ends meet.' Financial responsibilities would be easier to accomplish. Citizens would have the ability to concentrate on building better lives.
1.6.8.13. Pro: Every human belongs to the same species \(Homo Sapiens\), so they have the same moral rights and one of these is the right to survive.
1.6.8.14. Pro: There is also little dignity in sleeping on the street or subsisting on trash, which is what at-risk populations are increasingly being driven to as the wealth gap increases.
1.6.8.14.1. Con: This is more an argument for voluntary charity or means-tested social programs as it is for UBI, because extreme cases of poverty are relatively rare, and could be better dealt with programs aimed at that specific situation.
1.6.9. Con: -> See 1.6.7.1.
1.6.10. Con: People don't want to create financial equality for all \(as a UBI would provide\) but instead financial fairness, [where their efforts are rewarded and opportunities are accessible](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/people-dont-actually-want-equality/411784/).
1.6.10.1. Con: UBI would not create financial equality for all, as those who worked for pay or sold desired goods, ideas, or services could earn money above and beyond the provision of the UBI. This would also allow for efforts to be rewarded and opportunities to be accessible.
1.6.11. Con: UBI merely addresses some of the harms of inequality \(people being on low absolute incomes\) rather than addressing the structural causes of inequality.
1.6.11.1. Pro: UBI adresses the symptoms of inequality, but not the root cause: poor education.
1.6.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.6.11.1.2. Con: It is extremely presumptuous and probably inaccurate to definitely assign the root cause of inequality to one factor. If the problem were that simple, it would already be solved, or at least solutions would be in the process of being implemented.
1.6.11.1.3. Pro: UBI will not solve people making bad financial decisions. Financial education being taught in schools could resolve this issue. UBI could complement the education with practice. However people do not need money to make better financial decisions. They could instead figure out ways to save money.
1.6.11.2. Pro: A UBI reduces the political will needed to continue other welfare programs.
1.6.11.2.1. Con: Political events such as economic crises or right-leaning governments are inevitable and mean that the levels of welfare provided often follow a feast/famine cycle. Given this, a UBI provides a circuit-breaker solution that shores up some minimum level of support even as political will for welfare flucates over time.
1.6.11.2.1.1. Pro: When existing welfare programs are cut or restructured, having a UBI in place will help tide over those affected until the new programs are implemented.
1.6.11.2.1.2. Con: A UBI can also be dismantled or reduced. This is especially problematic because a UBI would be, by far, the biggest welfare program.
1.6.11.2.1.3. Con: Once established, a UBI changes the structure of the economy and societal psychology, and therefore is a commitment. If then, at any point, some serious crisis pushes the government to cut the UBI, it may be a deadly twist for the economy and people.
1.6.11.2.1.3.1. Con: This is true, but at the same time the changes to the economy and societal psychology could equally push people to care more about each other's welfare, be more interconnected, and respond better and with a more united front to any given crisis.
1.6.11.2.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.6.1.
1.6.11.2.1.4. Con: Unlike most welfare programs, UBI is easily reduced, altered, or removed entirely. All it would take to slash benefits for millions is altering a few numbers in a law code.
1.6.11.2.2. Pro: The all-encompassing and comprehensive nature of UBIs are unlike any other form of welfare \(which is much more targeted and small scale\). Given this, a UBI is likely to be seen as a complete solution to poverty and a replacement for current welfare policy.
1.6.11.2.2.1. Con: It should be seen as a complete solution for poverty and a replacement for our current welfare system. After all, the former is overtly stated in the name of the proposed policy "Universal Basic Income," and the latter is a core component of the policy.
1.6.11.2.2.1.1. Con: There are some difficulties which cannot be wholly addressed purely by providing money e.g. a lack of education, mental and physical illness, etc. Targeted welfare programs addressing these areas will still be required.
1.6.11.2.2.2. Con: Such a structure either gives incentive to produce and neglect children \(cash-for-children UBI\) or fails to provide childcare aid. Other welfare aid works in tandem with a universal benefit.
1.6.11.2.3. Con: Targeted welfare programs are subject to regulatory capture by self-interested voting blocks and lobbying interests.
1.6.11.2.3.1. Pro: In contrast, because a UBI is universal, all people who receive it have both an incentive to raise it, and share in the results of any lobbying to do so.
1.6.11.2.3.2. Pro: Because the middle class is an important voting block, they receive many benefits \(tax cuts, home buying subsidies, childcare services\) not because they need them but because of political pandering.
1.6.11.2.3.3. Pro: Pension programs \(unlike welfare aimed deliberately at the poor\) are generous and nearly-always [generously indexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Pension_\(United_Kingdom\)#Pensions_Act_2007) because of a large high-turnout voting base. Having the UBI replace the pension reorients their political capital towards the needs of the poor also.
1.6.11.2.3.4. Pro: The poor lack the money to fund successful lobbying campaigns and the numbers to form a successful voting block. As such, they have little political capital to affect the existing welfare program.
1.6.11.2.3.5. Con: Having a single payment scheme that almost all voters have a self-interest in creates a strong incentive for politicians to increase the payout amount ever-higher. This would, in the long term, create unsustainable levels of government expenditure.
1.6.11.2.3.6. Pro: Political parties have incentives to continue to give specific benefits to specific groups. This means we would be stuck with both UBI and traditional welfare schemes. As a result, UBI would be underfunded and fail to accomplish its purpose.
1.6.11.2.4. Con: The amount of welfare might decrease, but given that there is often a welfare gap that systematically excludes certain individuals even in the best versions of welfare, a UBI is a more equitable distribution of resources which maximizes overall welfare.
1.6.11.2.4.1. Pro: Even if it has more monetary weight, a UBI cuts bureaucracy costs and removes the disincentives to work that afflict many welfare systems.
1.6.11.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.4.
1.6.11.2.5. Pro: The implementation of a UBI reduces existing welfare spending by a significant amount.
1.6.11.2.5.1. Pro: People will work less, which also decreases available public revenue. This leads to a large deficit which will make cuts necessary.
1.6.11.2.5.1.1. Con: This claim assumes that public revenue is necessarily tied to income tax. Public revenue can also be raised through a consumption tax, value-added tax, carbon tax, etc... none of which would be reduced by a UBI.
1.6.11.2.5.1.1.1. Con: All taxes take from value creators a portion of the value they created, so by discouraging the creation of value, a UBI has the continuing effect of reducing its own source of funding, thus destroying itself.
1.6.11.2.5.1.2. Pro: A UBI is not sustainable because it relies for its funding on the taxing of value creation while at the same time it discourages value creation by reducing or removing the incentive to work to create value.
1.6.11.2.5.2. Con: A large portion of existing welfare is conditional cash payments. Individuals would still get most of this money, if not more, under a UBI.
1.6.11.2.5.3. Pro: In order for a state to gather the immense funds necessary for a UBI, and to avoid "double spending", it will need to cut funding for other welfare programs.
1.6.11.2.5.4. Pro: A UBI will require large amounts of political capital that will reduce the amount of political capital that will be used to support others, e.g. programs to support those with disabilities.
1.6.11.2.6. Pro: More important than a flexible income are the necessities of life: access to clean food, air, and water, a doctor when you're sick, a roof over your head and a good education. We should fight for universal access to these goods first.
1.6.11.2.6.1. Pro: This fight should take place at an individual and community level. A UBI gives these communities more to work with.
1.6.11.2.6.1.1. Pro: A UBI would help people to find the time and means to engage in activism.
1.6.11.2.7. Pro: Because instituting welfare programs requires political capital and public goodwill, a majority of which will be used instituting a UBI, it is unlikely that the general public will be sympathetic towards additional welfare programs if a UBI is implemented.
1.6.11.2.7.1. Con: Numerous additional welfare programs will ideally not be required under a UBI system. This model is intended to replace the fragmented and often inconsistent programs that states have in place currently.
1.6.11.2.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.5.
1.6.11.2.7.2. Con: A UBI appeals across the spectrum - for example, to liberals who see a duty to help those in poverty without putting unduly restrictive conditions on that help and to fiscally concerned conservatives who object to the inefficiency and bureaucracy of current welfare systems \(Milton Friedman [supported a form of UBI](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/universal-basic-income/)\). Therefore, a UBI is unlikely to undermine sympathy for other welfare programs.
1.6.11.2.7.2.1. Con: Even though a UBI appeals to both liberals and conservatives, their reasons are mutually exclusive. Because conservatives would see a UBI as a strategy to replace most of the existing welfare state, it would likely undermine their support for other welfare programs, whereas for liberals, a UBI would supplement existing safety-net programs \(e.g. childhood education subsidies, comprehensive health insurance etc\).
1.6.11.2.7.2.2. Con: It is likely that the implementation of a UBI would be fraught with division over where the funds would come from. For example, conservatives may not want increased taxes and liberals likely would, at least compared to cuts to public services.
1.6.11.2.7.2.2.1. Con: That is also true for any budget or tax reform discussion in any given government, not something specific to a UBI.
1.6.11.2.7.2.3. Con: While many may claim to support a UBI in principle, when it comes to implementing such a policy and very real sacrifices have to be made in the budget, it is likely that these opinions will change. Decreases in funding towards institutions like education, or the military could prove very unpopular.
1.6.11.2.7.3. Pro: For those in the middle and lower classes, there is unlikely to be buy-in towards a system that also distributes money to wealthy individuals who are not in financial need.
1.6.11.2.7.3.1. Pro: Wealthy people are able to meet their basic needs already. A UBI is not necessary for them to achieve adequate housing, medical care, education, or proper nutrition as it is with middle and lower class individuals.
1.6.11.2.7.3.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.
1.6.11.2.7.4. Pro: The public is reluctant to fund welfare because our society has deeply ingrained the capitalist idea of rewarding individuals for effort and working hard. Hard work is seen as a virtue, and something deserving of reward, and those with wealth they have not themselves earned \(for example, the rich children of billionaires\) are vilified.
1.6.11.2.7.4.1. Pro: Rich people are likely to believe that those in poverty are receiving money for nothing. Even now, with welfare usually contingent on demonstrating that one is at least looking for employment, stigma against those who "leech off welfare" without contributing is rampant.
1.6.11.2.7.4.2. Con: It tends to be poor people who do not work that are discriminated against, while rich people, including [inheritors](http://www.executivestyle.com.au/heir-style-the-rich-kids-who-have-it-all-2xbt0) and rich children, can become idols.
1.6.11.2.7.5. Pro: In Switzerland, the concept of a UBI was rejected [by close to a 3-1 margin](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36454060&sa=D&ust=1479913397736000&usg=AFQjCNGl2VcGG-v8Z_Qa1w8vKXvWgh59Cw), reflecting how politically unpopular a UBI is, and how much it is likely to squander political capital towards welfare if instituted.
1.6.11.2.7.5.1. Con: While Switzerland may have rejected the vote, 64% of Europeans in general were in favor of a UBI according to [a 2016 poll](https://daliaresearch.com/two-thirds-of-europeans-for-basic-income-dalia-ceo-presents-surprising-results-at-future-of-work-conference-in-zurich/).
1.6.11.2.7.5.2. Con: [A recent survey](https://futurism.com/survey-reveals-nearly-50-of-americans-favor-a-universal-basic-income/) in the US, a country known to favour free-markets and oppose government policy that could be construed as socialist, found that nearly half of Americans would support a UBI.
1.6.11.2.7.5.3. Con: As Switzerland already has the second [highest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)_per_capita) GDP per capita, its interest in implementing a UBI is obviously lower than that of comparatively poorer countries.
1.6.11.2.7.5.4. Con: Switzerland is an economically conservative country with a relatively small welfare system. More truly liberal countries such as Finland and the Netherlands are currently piloting the program with little backlash.
1.6.11.2.7.5.4.1. Con: One concern brought to light by the [Finnish experiment](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/01/ubi-finland-centre-party-unemployment-jobs/) is that a person's allotment of the UBI replaces their state benefits, which are controlled by labour unions. A person may be loth to accept UBI and be blocked out of his/her union as a result.
1.6.11.2.7.5.4.1.1. Con: This a situation entirely unique to Finland.
1.6.11.2.7.5.4.2. Pro: At the outset of the Finnish UBI experiment, [over half the population was in favour](http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/study_over_half_the_population_supports_basic_income_scheme/8583547) of the scheme.
1.6.11.2.7.5.4.3. Con: In the case of Finland, this is potentially due to the fact that their pilot program is only a 'partial basic income', available only to [unemployed](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-finnish-experiment/) participants, who would likely not oppose an influx of free money.
1.6.11.2.8. Pro: A UBI would almost certainly replace other welfare programs because that would be the only way to pay for it.
1.6.11.2.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.6.11.2.8.2. Pro: A UBI means significant expenditure increases \(United States\) to ensure edge cases are taken care of. Based on 2015 numbers, there are ~252 million adults \(18+\) with ~$1.468 trillion in social security, unemployment, labor, food assistance and other benefits. This only leaves $5,828.37 pp/yr. The poverty line is at ~$11,770 pp. [media.nationalpriorities.org](https://media.nationalpriorities.org/uploads/budget-graphic.png)
1.6.11.2.8.2.1. Con: The parent's dollar figures seem too low. Using the same [source](https://media.nationalpriorities.org/uploads/budget-graphic.png):

$986 billion: Medicare & Health
$895 billion: Social Security
$104 billion: Food Assistance
$36 billion: Unemployment
---
$2.021 trillion: Total

Divided by the same 252 million population figure, this comes out to $8,019.94 pp/yr, substantially higher than the parent's estimate.

And it could go even higher if other spending from the source such as Housing & Community, Education and the mysterious "Other" figures are included.
1.6.11.2.8.3. Pro: A UBI might lead to restrictions on other entitlements, given the budgetary constraints it would pose to the Federal Government.
1.6.11.2.9. Con: Whilst it is true that there will be limited demand for most welfare programs, some programs without the stigma of poverty will likely still have sufficient political capital: e.g. funding for children with disabilities.
1.6.11.2.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.9.
1.6.11.2.10. Con: Given that everyone receives something under a UBI, once normalised, it may actually increase the balance of political capital for welfare. Extreme cases would likely still have public support on top of the standard of living that a UBI guarantees for everyone.
1.6.11.2.10.1. Con: This argument is premised on the notion that individuals' utility from the UBI outweighs the loss of utility from a higher tax rate and perceived infringement on their quality of life. Middle-class individuals might receive more UBI back from the state than they have to pay in taxes, but the perception that their hard-earned monies are being taken away does resonate with voters squeezed by the changing economy.
1.6.11.2.10.1.1. Con: If a policy would financially benefit people, the government should work to fix people's perception of the policy instead of giving up on it.
1.6.11.2.10.2. Con: UBI neglects political reality because wealthy citizens receive payments regardless of whether the system is in the self-interest of any beneficiary; whether it be bureaucrats, special interest groups, or voters. All political incentive is driven by the pressure of beneficiaries. Since there is no beneficiary, there cannot be any political incentive and thus a UBI will not be ratified.
1.6.11.2.10.2.1. Con: There are people who will vote for a political entity who proposes to implement a UBI, whether because of personal self-interest, moral and ethical reasons, or other reasons entirely. The idea that people act purely out of self-interest is patently incorrect in practice.
1.6.11.2.10.2.1.1. Con: Politicking is inherently immoral. Politicking does not include the dissemination of policies, so movements such as the abolishionist movement are exempt from this issue. UBI, however, does not fall into that category. Political voting is at least amoral. Therefore, there being a sufficient motivation among citizens for UBI on moral grounds is unlikely.
1.6.11.2.10.2.1.1.1. Con: The moralities of the policies proposed by political parties and candidates do have an effect on which ones get voted for by citizens, so they are relevant.
1.6.11.2.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.9.
1.6.11.2.11. Con: If UBI does replace other welfare systems, it will likely be due to the success of the system, and could not be seen as a 'con' of UBI.
1.6.11.2.12. Pro: It may be a good idea in theory, but in practice UBI could potentially be used to cut benefits programmes that many people rely on to survive. Consider what's going on with Universal Credit \(where six programmes were slashed and replaced with one\), which is now being cut. When you get rid of multiple programmes and create one, it's naturally going to constitute less, and thus a smaller social safety net
1.6.11.2.12.1. Con: Giving the same amounts under fewer programs creates less bureaucracy, and thus less wastage and allows more money to be put into the program itself.
1.6.11.2.12.2. Con: If there are too many welfare programs, there is nothing stopping the government from cutting entire programs rather than merely making cuts to the fewer programs that exist. Larger numbers of programs is no protection if the government has the political will to cut welfare programs.
1.6.11.2.12.3. Con: If the government has the political will and intention to cut welfare programs, that is not the fault of how many welfare programs there are, but the attitude of the government and the people who put them there \(or the government not effectively representing the people\). Ultimately, the number of welfare programs is irrelevant from this perspective.
1.6.11.2.13. Con: Political will is not a currency; it can be renewed and expanded rather than permanently depleted.
1.6.11.2.13.1. Pro: It is the role of the Citizens to demand from their government those services that ensure equity. A person with a severe disability requires extra services to ensure individual equity. Political will stems from the voice of the citizens who choose their representatives. Political will for a social welfare safety net will not be found in those who would seek to place the fate of citizens in the hands of the corporate class.
1.6.11.2.13.2. Pro: One a UBI has been passed the political will needed to do so will quickly renew \(as the policy becomes normalised\) and can then be used to support other policies.
1.6.11.2.14. Con: If there continue to be deficits in the public economy that need addressing, such as daycare, or basic nutrition, or housing, then there will still be demand for targeted programs to support those societal needs.
1.6.11.3. Pro: UBI is simply a stopgap measure propagated by dominant corporations to make up for their monopolized contributions to income inequality. Automation is not the threat, it's the current oligopolistic structure of our economy - and that needs to be solved rather than providing simple UBI.
1.6.11.3.1. Con: If automation is not a threat, but rather the way things are, then we should treat the symptoms of this economic system. UBI is a potential way to do this.
1.6.11.4. Pro: UBI would exacerbate the structural forces that drive inequality, by making a larger portion of the population unemployed and dependent on the government.
1.6.11.5. Pro: Native American tribes with casino revenues are a harbinger for large-scale UBI programs. The Seneca Nation pays [$8000 annually](https://ifstudies.org/blog/what-can-we-learn-from-native-americans-about-a-universal-basic-income) to each tribe member and yet unemployment, poverty and theft continue to rise. The guaranteed, subsistence income seems to have contributed to the stagnation of their society.
1.6.11.5.1. Con: There are other factors involved in the underprivileged situations endured by many indigenous people, such as poor education and cultural integration.
1.6.12. Con: UBI falls victim to the real notion of perceived poverty - whereas in some countries those considered poor are often much better off than the poor of other countries, so too will those subsisting on the UBI alone end up perceived just as poor as those without it, and thus it will do nothing to fix society in a satisfying way.
1.6.12.1. Con: Relative poverty and absolute poverty are about numerical relationships, not perception.
1.6.12.2. Con: Providing a guaranteed payment to all citizens promotes the idea that human life is intrinsically valuable and should be supported.
1.6.12.3. Con: Perception is not the only problem, nor the greatest portion of it - actually starving to death, or even just being unable to afford healthcare it would be better for one to receive, are both objective states of being and far greater issues than the social status of the impoverished, and these are issues a UBI is likely to address.
1.6.12.4. Pro: It is a simplification to assume the difference between the rich and the poor is simply financial. To be richer than another you need to be able to buy/access things that poorer others are unable to. UBI will simply shift the margins but the differences will still remain. Prices of good/services will adjust \(obviously\) to soak up the UBI. This is less about inflation and more about understanding the concept that rich/poor is only measured by finance but exists beyond it.
1.6.12.5. Con: We have Americans, including veterans, that deal with food insecurity right now. The problem is not perception.
1.6.13. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.
1.6.14. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.5.4.6.1.
1.6.15. Con: Since a UBI as proposed does not yet include programs to guarantee jobs as well, it could create an environment where most people live at the poverty line - essentially helping no one.
1.6.15.1. Con: Part of the objective of a UBI is to move away from a work-based economic system.
1.6.15.2. Pro: The poor will use their UBI to buy apples which they consume, while the wealthy use it to buy Apple stock which further increases their income – and so grow wealthier. Thus over time, UBI mathematically increases disparity. Economist Pavlina Tcherneva writes extensively [here](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2014/01/16-reasons-matt-yglesias-wrong-job-guarantee-vs-basic-income.html) about how a Job Guarantee offers a superior practical solution.
1.6.15.2.1. Con: This is a highly speculative claim, and most UBI plans suggest a very small amount of money per person, basically enough to live on and no more \(no more than current welfare\). In this case the increase to the wealth of people who are better off would be negligible. It seems highly unlikely that an already wealthy person's receipt of UBI would greatly affect how much money they invest, or anything else.
1.6.16. Con: A UBI does not share wealth because it gives a portion to those who are already wealthy. This does nothing to resolve financial inequality.
1.6.16.1. Con: The rebate offered to the wealthy by a UBI is not of consequence given that those people pay more tax than they receive in government services. It is just effectively a slight change in their tax rate.
1.6.16.2. Con: While this is technically true, the implementation of a UBI will most likely require tax rates to become more progressive overall, and thus levels of financial inequality will decrease.
1.6.16.3. Pro: According to the [relative income hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_income_hypothesis), consumers make purchases and save money depending on their percentile position within the income distribution. A UBI may increase spending, but does not improve the income gap.
1.6.16.3.1. Con: This does not account for the fact that a UBI is a redistribution program. The money that goes to those who are poor comes from those who have more, so there is a difference in relative income.
1.6.16.3.2. Con: These two points are unrelated. Whether or not UBI will increase spending \(unclear\) has no bearing on the income gap, which it does address.
1.6.16.4. Pro: This means that minorities are still in the same socio-economic position they were before relative to the privileged in society.
1.6.16.4.1. Con: This is an over simplification. When you have not enough money to make it through the month, your position is much more desperate that when you don't have money for leisure. To deny this basic comfort on the base of "relative wealth" is to forget that there is more similarity of experiences between poor people everywhere in the world than within the "steps" of a single social pyramid.
1.6.16.4.2. Con: Minorities are much better off when they have economic security.
1.6.16.4.2.1. Pro: Even groups who lack the social cohesion, self identification and social recognition of minorities will benefit from this. It will effectively surpass current efforts to increase the quality of life in the current narrative and support structure.
1.6.16.4.2.2. Pro: The idea of a UBI is that even the poorest would have enough money to cover basic expenses.
1.6.16.4.2.2.1. Pro: By choosing to work, they can earn additional income, which would be disposable income. This would never be possible without a UBI since all of their money would go towards making ends meet.
1.6.16.4.3. Pro: Minorities continue to experience a wage gap in the workplace. A UBI does not solve this discrimination.
1.6.16.4.3.1. Con: If someone is not dependent on a certain job, they can choose more freely to walk away from workplaces where they are not treated fairly with less risk of endangering their means for subsistence.
1.6.16.4.3.1.1. Pro: The fact that labor would no longer be forced into sub-poverty conditions by an employer or else face starvation and social chastisement should they "fail to keep a job" will change the job market drastically and empower everyone.
1.6.16.4.3.1.2. Con: This wage gap disparity is widespread. The likelihood of a minority finding a job with fair wages in comparison to those not considered a minority is slim.
1.6.16.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Minorities will be empowered to become entrepreneurs and their representation in companies will increase as a consequence of UBI. This will assist in the correction of the indicated problem.
1.6.16.4.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.6.16.4.3.2. Con: [Some feminists](http://basicincome.org/bien/pdf/munich2012/katada.pdf) see a UBI as an “emancipation fee”, and criticize the welfare state because they argue that it is largely based on a traditional model of male breadwinner and female housekeeper. They conclude that a UBI can be useful to overcome this form of discrimination.
1.6.16.4.3.2.1. Pro: A UBI is a way of reevaluating the economic value of the work women have primarily handled in the past, while also promoting the economic independence of women. UBIs are an “Emancipation Fee” paid to promote women’s liberation \([Katada, p. 3](http://basicincome.org/bien/pdf/munich2012/katada.pdf)\)
1.6.16.4.3.2.1.1. Con: UBI payments go to men as well as women, and regardless of contributions to housework, childcare, eldercare or other traditionally unpaid female labour.
1.6.16.4.3.2.2. Con: A UBI returns women to the home, and contributes to a backlash that runs counter to women’s liberation and independence.
1.6.16.4.3.3. Con: A UBI was never designed to — or claimed to — eliminate workplace discrimination.
1.6.16.4.3.4. Pro: [Gay](https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/evidence/PX0605.pdf) government employees in the US earn 8% to 29% less than their heterosexual counterparts.
1.6.16.4.3.5. Pro: [Transgender workers](http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/resources/NTDS_Exec_Summary.pdf) experience rates of unemployment at double the rate of the general population due to firing, wage discrimination, or harassment. This has a negative impact on their income.
1.6.16.4.3.6. Pro: The [racial wage gap](http://time.com/4390212/race-wage-gap-pew-analysis/) in the US shows that Black men earn only 73% of white men's hourly earning and Hispanic men earn just 69%. These numbers have not significantly changed in 35 years. Its unlikely that UBI will change this.
1.6.16.4.3.6.1. Con: Improved social mobility due to reduced paycheck-to-paycheck budgeting allows them to find better and less discriminatory opportunities, and will help close this gap.
1.6.16.4.4. Pro: Minorities will still be locked out of certain employment opportunities for prejudicial reasons.
1.6.16.4.4.1. Pro: There are [many accounts](https://www.revealnews.org/article/when-companies-hire-temp-workers-by-race-black-applicants-lose-out/) of temp agencies hiring out with direct orders not to hire Black Americans, despite equal opportunity employment policies.
1.6.16.4.4.2. Pro: [Hiring practices](http://thelasource.com/en/2011/10/31/university-study-finds-prejudice-in-hiring-practices/) in Montreal, Vancouver, and Toronto favored applicants with English sounding names over Asian sounding names.
1.6.16.4.4.3. Con: Whether or not this is true, this is no reason not to offer a UBI. If this is true it means we should be looking for ways to reduce this prejudice. It does not mean we should give up on other ways to help a given minority, i.e. it is no reason not to offer a UBI.
1.6.16.5. Con: While a UBI does not correct income inequality, it assures equality of opportunity.
1.6.16.5.1. Con: A UBI is not enough to create equal opportunities for both the poor and wealthy.
1.6.16.5.1.1. Pro: The wealthy have educational advantages as they can pay for prestigious university tuition and tutors.
1.6.16.5.1.2. Pro: Wealthy individuals often have networks with peers and good connections that make it easier for them to find jobs.
1.6.16.5.1.3. Con: There is a difference between equality of opportunity and equality of economic income. Equality of economic income would never be reached and would potentially lead to an economic paralysis, while equality of opportunity would be the incentive to make everybody participate in the work market.
1.6.16.5.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.4.2.
1.6.16.5.1.5. Pro: What about poor countries? If only wealthy countries will have this than we solved only a fraction of the issue, and we already have a system that resolves only a fraction of the problem globally.
1.6.16.5.2. Pro: A UBI provides people with a sufficient amount of money to allow everybody to have access to food, health, education and housing.
1.6.16.5.2.1. Con: Food, health & education - yes, maybe. But housing is a mostly fixed supply - regardless of how much money you give people, everyone cannot have access to housing unless there is more supply than demand. This isn't usually the case due to the inherent difficulty of creating new housing units.
1.6.16.5.2.1.1. Con: There are currently houses \(and units\) left unoccupied for economic reasons - and/or because the landowner prefers the loss of no tenant rather than the risk to their investment - in at least some countries.
1.6.16.5.3. Con: A UBI does not assure equal opportunity when the UBI does not cover it \(such as a [higher cost-of-living than a UBI can handle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl39KHS07Xc)\).
1.6.16.6. Con: Minorities have real problems that endanger their health and sometimes their lives, like living in very poor conditions, being malnourished, not having access to health care and education, etc. A UBI can afford them better health, education, and housing.
1.6.16.6.1. Con: There are [government public assistance programs](https://www.usa.gov/benefits) available that already provide benefits to improving health care access, education, proper nutrition, and housing.
1.6.16.6.2. Pro: A UBI will reduce unclaimed medical costs caused by malnurishment, dehydration and various homeless injuries. In turn, this will cause an overall increase in national health.
1.6.16.6.3. Pro: Eliminating these problems should be the absolute priority, even if this does not also solve discrimination and inequality.
1.6.16.7. Pro: A guaranteed UBI is incompatible with equal human rights. It separates society into net payers and net receivers.
1.6.16.7.1. Con: Inequality exists in all societal models and everyone within an economic system either has a net gain or a net loss. However, this has no bearing on fundamental rights and there is no visible human rights issue with the implementation of UBI.
1.6.16.7.2. Con: Many countries, like the US, already have an 'unfair' progressive tax system that seperate society into net payers and receivers.
1.6.16.7.3. Con: A UBI is one way of ensuring the right to life - including necessities and adequate shelter/healthcare/etc. - is met.
1.6.16.8. Con: Because a UBI is a flat rate, the portion it gives to the poor could double their current income. To the wealthy it would only be a marginal increase. In relative terms this is a huge decrease in inequality.
1.6.16.8.1. Pro: This is referred to as the [diminishing marginal utility of income](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/12309/concepts/diminishing-marginal-utility-of-income-and-wealth/).
1.6.16.8.2. Pro: A person making $1000 and receiving a UBI of $500 would see their income increase by 50%;  a person making $10,000 and receiving a UBI of $500 would only see an income increase of 5%.
1.6.16.9. Pro: Since the UBI is provided to all, it would simply move the "0.00" income level higher for all people. This would result in no relative change since everybody is making \(Prior Income\) + \(UBI\) instead of just \(Prior Income\). It seems to be a mathematical illusion. How would UBI address income inequality if UBI is truly universal?
1.6.16.9.1. Con: Inequalities are both absolute and relative. If "moving the 0.00" level up by a few thousand dollars allows people to afford healthcare or to heat their homes it makes a huge difference in their quality of life relative to the middle classes.
1.6.16.9.2. Con: -> See 1.6.16.8.
1.6.16.10. Pro: A UBI would further increase the economic gap because the needy would use it for necessities and the rich would bank/invest theirs.
1.6.16.10.1. Con: A UBI would not be a significant increase to the finances of highly wealthy individuals, but would be a significant improvement to less well-off people - both those who would use it to eat and those who would use it to invest in owning their own home.
1.6.16.11. Con: Only by making UBI universal will the wealthier support the provision of such an income rise for the poorer. As the wealthier seem happy to pocket universal benefits too \(even when claiming to disagree with them\).
1.6.16.12. Pro: The wealth can be equally shared by effective taxation and welfare programs.
1.6.16.13. Pro: Giving everyone welfare, including the uber wealthy, is not the solution to problems with the way mean-tested schemes of welfare are calculated. The solution needs to be to change the way welfare is calculated.
1.6.16.13.1. Con: Removing  the concept of "welfare" will go a long way to solving perception issues such as this. The whole idea of a universal income is that it is earned by one's place in society and is not a 'handout'.
1.6.17. Pro: A UBI will reduce discrimination by empowering groups that traditionally lack influence due to economic barriers.
1.6.17.1. Pro: With a UBI, these groups now have the capital to receive an education and pursue high-skilled jobs. This will help remedy the lack of skilled professionals in minority communities.
1.6.17.1.1. Pro: Minority doctors are more likely [to return to their communities](http://commonhealth.legacy.wbur.org/2012/02/minority-doctors-diversity) and service those who traditionally do not have access to medical care.
1.6.17.2. Pro: A UBI improves the economic freedom of women.
1.6.17.2.1. Pro: Women would no longer have to stay in abusive relationships due to a lack of income.
1.6.17.2.1.1. Con: Women should not rely on the income of an abusive partner, they can leave and get a job if necessary.
1.6.17.2.1.1.1. Con: Doing so without an income stream of your own often means having to survive without accomodation or any form of financial security; making this highly difficult.
1.6.17.2.1.1.2. Con: For women to be able to leave an abusive partner they need a way to ensure they and their children won't be left in poverty and homelessness because of this decision. A UBI would provide that safety net for them to be able to change their minds and safely leave abusive relationships.
1.6.17.2.1.1.3. Con: In order to leave an abusive relationship in which they are dependent, women would often need to get a job even before they do so. Abusive partners often prohibit women from getting a job, making the jump difficult. An UBI would remove this control mechanism from abusive partners.
1.6.17.2.1.1.4. Con: Abuse can have many physical and mental effects which make it more difficult \(and often impossible\) to get a job, such as lack of sleep, \(often extreme\) stress, malnutrition, physical injury, shame and the desire to hide one's situation, the destruction of one's personal identity and self-esteem, the destruction of one's belief in their own competence, morality, and agency, and the destruction of one's belief in their worthiness of any form of achievement or reward.
1.6.17.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.23.4.3.1.2.1.
1.6.17.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.23.4.3.1.6.
1.6.17.2.4. Pro: A UBI can make a critical contribution to women's autonomy, security and flexibility \([Regehr, p.14](http://www.basicincome.org/bien/pdf/montreal2014/BIEN2014_Regehr.pdf)\).
1.6.17.2.4.1. Con: This can only be achieved by reducing the autonomy, security and flexibility of other women \(via increases their taxes\). To justify helping some women by harming other women is hypocritical.
1.6.17.2.4.1.1. Con: Given men earn, on average, more than woman the redistributive effects UBI would actually be a net benefit to women at the cost of men.
1.6.17.2.4.1.2. Con: Assuming proportionate taxation, the effect on taxpaying women will be far less significant than the effect on women who depend on or gain significant benefit from receiving a UBI.
1.6.17.2.4.1.3. Con: Taxes besides income tax can be used to fund a UBI, as can non-taxation methods of increasing government revenue.
1.6.17.2.5. Pro: A UBI guaranteed to any citizen of a said country may allow inequalities between men and woman to be slightly reduced. Not only women would be able to stop working more confortably during their pregnancy, but it would also allow them to be less vulnerable when they are students \(from miserable jobs often given to them in a society that still rewards more men than women on the employment market\). More generally, one more tool for their independance from the men is also one for their emancipation.
1.6.17.2.6. Con: A UBI is zero-sum and does not enhance the freedom of some without equal inhibition of freedom on others.
1.6.17.2.6.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that it is a zero sum game. Any policy that helps those who most need money raises the total amount of freedom in the economy \(the poor gain more than the rich loose\) more than just a simple redistribution would suggest.
1.6.17.2.6.2. Pro: If a person collects their UBI, pays for their necessities, and then sits on the couch watching TV for the rest of their life, they have gained the freedom to do so at the expense of all involved in the production of said entertainment.
1.6.17.2.6.2.1. Con: The person who sits on their couch watching TV will have used their UBI or some other form of income to pay for the programming they are watching.
1.6.17.2.6.3. Pro: Whilst the UBI may provide freedom for one group, it can only do so by reducing the freedom of another group.
1.6.17.2.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.4.1.3.
1.6.17.2.7. Pro: Unpaid work, such as supporting younger and older family members is often a burden disproportionately affecting females. The guarantee of a UBI reduces the risks from part time work, thus helping females enter and leave the work force as they need or want.
1.6.17.2.8. Con: The view that the UBI somehow levels the playing field in upper management can't hold true. The UBI would most likely serve to oppress women by citing that wage inequality is a non-issue in the first place.
1.6.17.2.8.1. Con: The fact that people could \(mis\)use a UBI as an argument against addressing other social injustices such as the gender pay gap \(which are related to factors beyond poverty and lack of funds\) is not an argument against implementing a UBI.
1.6.17.2.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.6.
1.6.17.3. Pro: Wealth is also a massive predictor in [civic engagement](http://www.people-press.org/2015/01/08/the-politics-of-financial-insecurity-a-democratic-tilt-undercut-by-low-participation/), insofar as it is able to grant stability to people from less advantaged backgrounds, it affords them the time and agency to push for the types of political change that wouldn't be possible otherwise.
1.6.17.3.1. Pro: Not only will more people agitate for change, but it will also change incentives for politicians who have to more actively target or incorporate traditionally non-politically enfranchised groups.
1.6.17.3.2. Con: They still only have a finite degree of political capital when engaging with elites. If wealthy people already feel as though they are contributing towards the UBI, they are less likely to support these kinds of initiatives.
1.6.17.3.2.1. Con: What the wealthy want and desire becomes less relevant in a world where massively more people are enfranchised.
1.6.17.3.2.2. Con: This same logic could also be applied to all of the social welfare programs, yet many wealthy individuals still distinguish between their own self interest and what is best for people broadly.
1.6.17.3.3. Con: States are also able to use the fact that there is a UBI to justify failing to engage with specific political change.
1.6.17.3.3.1. Con: If states fail to engage with specific political change, these disadvantaged groups are now considerably more able to hold them accountable due to increases in political awareness and activism brought about by less worry for basic daily struggles.
1.6.17.3.4. Con: NGOs and other special interest groups \(such as the NAACP\) are able to fulfill this form of engagement.
1.6.17.3.4.1. Con: These NGO's and advocacy groups are much stronger and greater political forces in a world where their constituents have more access to capital.
1.6.17.3.4.2. Con: These groups cannot \(and do not claim to\) speak to all of the diverse interests and desires of their own constituency. To claim that NGO's and hierarchical organizations can by themselves compensate for the political voices of millions is naive and dangerous.
1.6.17.3.5. Pro: By giving workers a wage security, many decision making processes such as voting are being freed from that economic incentive, leaving room for potentially more thoughtful debates.
1.6.17.4. Con: Contingent on providing wealth, an income just above the poverty line is neither meaningful wealth nor economic inclusion.
1.6.17.4.1. Con: A UBI ensures that our most important needs are accounted for in a stable manner. This is incredibly meaningful and comparatively leads to far more political engagement, even if not all recipients become dedicated activists.
1.6.17.5. Con: A UBI is not enough to make a person middle class, only enough to prevent poverty. Many of these benefits are better achieved by education and social benefit access than by income.
1.6.17.5.1. Con: Access to education and the ability to lift oneself from one class to another are more easily achieved when one has basic needs accounted for.
1.6.17.5.2. Con: An individual does not need to be middle class to have political efficacy and influence, they need time. However, in the status quo people on the poverty line are not only poor but have no energy to invest in the political process due to work and life demands.
1.6.18. Pro: Studies show that Alaska \(the only state with UBI at present\) is also the state with the lowest financial inequality. In [2015 Alaska had the 2nd lowest inequality, but today it has the least.](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jp5wdb/only-state-free-money-alaska)
1.6.18.1. Con: Alaska may offer a poor case test. It’s geographical and demographic markers, may make the state too anamolous — too much of an outlier — to properly transfer to the US mainland.
1.6.19. Pro: A UBI will benefit the middle class, by increasing median household income among the middle class.
1.6.19.1. Pro: [Alaska, the only state with a UBI](https://qz.com/1205591/a-universal-basic-income-experiment-in-alaska-shows-employment-didnt-drop/), has the [highest median household income for middle class](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/24/heres-how-much-money-middle-class-families-earn-in-every-us-state.html). Alaska's middle class make $80,000 per year, while middle class in all other states make less — up to $10,000 less.
1.6.20. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.1.16.
1.6.21. Pro: -> See 1.2.21.
1.6.22. Con: There could be an increased dependence of cheaper "non-citizens" to provide the labour force. Eventually leading to an elite/subordinate citizen/ non-citizen segregated society.
1.6.22.1. Con: Our moral values are strongly against such things, at least in the West. So it's unlikely to happen at least in the current Western nations.
1.6.22.2. Con: "Non-citizens" who provide labour could become citizens and therefore recipients of a UBI.
1.6.22.3. Con: A valid point but something that could easily be avoided by providing UBI to anyone living in said country. Today, in most industrialised countries there are welfare programs taking care of workers, earning too little to make a living, anyway. So this would be a different distribution pattern.
1.6.23. Pro: UBI compensates people for the injustice created by the institution of private property.
1.6.24. Con: It flattens the top on social mobility as those who become more productive would bear a greater burden for those happily being carried at the bottom. Someone pays for overcompensating less valuable labor.
1.7. Pro: A UBI better rewards meaningful contributions to society, such as domestic labour, art, volunteering, engaging with politics, and pursuing higher education.
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.
1.7.2. Pro: Domestic labour \(e.g. child and aged care\) are vital to the function of family and societal units. However, it is currently devalued by our income system and lacks financial recompense. Instituting a UBI creates compensation and assigns value to this labour, supporting those individuals who undertake it.
1.7.2.1. Con: There are experiments to deal with this, such as an old-age home in Holland that gives [free housing to students in exchange for time they spend with elderly residents](http://www.universityherald.com/articles/53852/20161207/dutch-university-students-free-housing-exchange-valuable-service-elderly.htm).
1.7.2.2. Con: This doesn't work in practice, as, for example, a stay-at-home mother who does full time domestic labour will still receive the same UBI as her partner who does none of it.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: A UBI can decrease the necessity to work long hours, thus providing working partners more time and energy for domestic labor efforts. This essentially helps both individuals.
1.7.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.23.4.3.1.2.1.
1.7.2.2.3. Con: A UBI is not a job fee, but it can balance out those unpaid jobs that are still not recognized by the State.
1.7.2.2.4. Con: The working partner will also receive the benefits of the external job, and in most households, will also be contributing to the labour of managing the houshold.
1.7.2.3. Pro: Unpaid labour tends to be highly gendered with the bulk of work expected to be fulfilled by women. In this context it is important to implement systems that support women in these roles and provide greater financial autonomy.
1.7.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.16.4.3.2.1.
1.7.2.3.2. Con: The fact that the labor is unpaid is a symptom of the destruction of the arrangement that exchanged provision for the household for management of the household, rather than the problem itself- in which when both parties are providing for the household, it simply becomes extra work for one or both providers, instead of compensated work in exchange for the others' provision.
1.7.2.3.2.1. Con: That arrangement was and is problematic. However, it leaves the unpaid worker vulnerable to abuse and otherwise at the mercy of the provider, who can provide exactly as much or as little as they please, unless the unpaid domestic worker has effective legal recourse - which often is and was not the case. Its destruction \(or reconstruction\) is a reasonable and desirable process.
1.7.2.4. Pro: The value of unpaid care in the US [is estimated at $691 billion](http://www.washington.edu/news/2015/06/16/study-reveals-surprising-truths-about-caregivers/); over 4% of GDP.
1.7.2.4.1. Con: Unpaid care could and should be addressed by targeted programs, rather than a UBI which just indiscriminately provides everyone with money.
1.7.2.5. Pro: A UBI alleviates the stress of insufficient [maternity leave](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ritarubin/2016/04/06/united-states-lags-behind-all-other-developed-countries-when-it-comes-to-paid-maternity-leave/#20f54bd05ada) for expectant mothers and their families.
1.7.2.5.1. Con: The problem of insufficient maternity leave \(which the article notes is a major problem in America\) could be addressed by increasing maternity leave support, rather than providing everyone with unconditional money regardless of whether they likely need it more or less than the average person.
1.7.2.6. Con: This has been historically managed by having one partner fully provide for all of the needs of the other who is in that doing the domestic work: in that creating the ends that financial recompense acts as means for. Separating these from each other destabilizes the family unit, rather than supporting its functions.
1.7.2.6.1. Con: -> See 1.7.2.3.2.1.
1.7.2.7. Con: There are more direct and effective ways to compensate for child/aged care, such as access to healthcare for children and aged populations as well as tax deductions or credits for having or adopting children.
1.7.2.7.1. Con: Those methods are not mutually exclusive with a UBI; moreover they only compensate for some aspects of raising a child \(healthcare, or 9-5 care\) rather than the entire endeavour.
1.7.2.8. Con: All UBI does is in this case, is not award good parents for being good or discourages bad parents for being bad, a reason why non-discriminatory systems don't work.
1.7.2.8.1. Con: The majority of parents are good; to punish them for the actions of the bad ones is unfair.
1.7.2.8.2. Con: There are plenty of discriminatory systems that can co-exist with a UBI, such as criminal sanctions, child services interventions, and the withdrawal of non-UBI benefits or privileges.
1.7.2.9. Con: If this work were of high value to parents, the caretakers of the aged, and the aged themselves, they would be willing to pay for it in proportion to that high value. The fact that their valuation of such services is not as high as some would like represents a valid difference in personal priorities and is not a structural imbalance in need of reform.
1.7.2.9.1. Con: People cannot be willing to pay money they do not have, as in the case of stay at home parents who either are not provided a fair portion of the family's income, or are simply in a lower-income socioeconomic bracket.
1.7.2.9.2. Con: Historically, caretaking roles have been undervalued for a number of reasons, including the expectation for women to perform them for free, merely in return for housing and basic necessities \(and often with a side of abuse\). This historical impact has not yet entirely faded.
1.7.2.9.3. Con: This claim assumes most people are enlightened capitalists able and willing to think in such terms. This is not true. Most people do not make rational purchasing decisions based purely on capitalistic logic and ideals.
1.7.2.10. Pro: A UBI benefits caregivers and gives a decent life to people with disabilities.
1.7.2.10.1. Con: -> See 1.7.2.4.1.
1.7.2.11. Con: UBI assigns the same financial reward to the selfless mother as it does a man who does nothing but play visual novels all day.
1.7.2.12. Pro: A UBI is a feminist issue. For too long the economic model has been proped up up the unpaid work of carers \(mainly women\).  This work is the real cost of doing business and needs just compensation; something a UBI can achieve.
1.7.2.13. Con: Babysitters are paid. If your argument is they aren't paid enough, in a capitalist society, they're paid exactly as much as they're worth, and aren't forced to work and do so willingly for the amount they are paid. If they want to be paid more, they should charge more, if no one will hire them at the higher rate, then they're obviously not worth the higher rate.
1.7.2.14. Con: Hospice care is a paid position. If your argument is they aren't paid enough, in a capitalist society, they're paid exactly as much as they're worth, and aren't forced to work and do so willingly for the amount they are paid. If they want to be paid more, they should charge more, if no one will hire them at the higher rate, then they're obviously not worth the higher rate.
1.7.2.15. Con: Being a stay at home parent is an option, with alternatives like working and letting someone else take care of your children. Many times this decision is made for one of two reasons: 1\) It costs more to pay someone to watch your children for you then you would earn working outside the home. OR 2\) You want to care for your children yourself, and thus choose to forego the income of working outside the home. Society shouldn't have to pay for your choices. You should.
1.7.3. Pro: Many forms of creative expression, such as art or writing, are not pursued because only the most successful artists or writers can generate a self-sustaining income.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Wikipedia and many other open-source community creations are an example of unpaid work that has great societal value. A UBI would help reward and sustain these valuable resources.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Artists, who have always struggled to find funding adequate enough to develop their oeuvre, will benefit greatly from a reliable income.
1.7.3.3. Pro: Even the pursuit of creative activities as a way to achieve a financial reward may in many cases lead to those activities [being enjoyed less and pursued less effectively](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/motivation.html).
1.7.3.4. Con: The is no shortage of supply of "creative expression" in the today's wealthy countries. It far from obvious how increase in volume of "creative expression" produced will benefit society as whole. Or if additional volume of work produced will be "meaningful contribution" to society.
1.7.3.4.1. Con: Creative expression can function as critique of society, or otherwise provide moral lessons or other points to think about, and can inspire further artwork - in response or indirectly. This increased reflection and intellectual stimulus may lead to innovation, societal progress, or other benefits.
1.7.3.4.2. Con: Many people use artworks and works of fiction to relax and as a temporary reprieve. The stress-reducing and satisfaction/morale-increasing effects of this can lead to improved production in other areas, as well as a reduction in the negative effects of stress \(shorter-temperedness, stress-related illness\).
1.7.3.5. Con: Producing quality "creative expression" is a hard work. Assuming that introduction of unconditional income will increase the total amount of high quality works of art is unfounded and naive.
1.7.3.5.1. Con: "Practice makes perfect", or at least has a positive relationship with quality. Additional time permitted for artistic endeavour \(such as by a UBI reducing the stress of providing for basics\) will increase the quality of artistic production.
1.7.3.5.2. Pro: Simple probability statistics disagree with this thesis. A greater number of artistic creators, even using the Infinite Monkey Theorem as a productivity yardstick, will invariably increase the number of quality artistic works being created.  More artists means more art means more good art. While the average quality of UBI-funded art may be less, but more great art will invariably get produced if there are more artists making art.
1.7.3.6. Con: If artists struggle to earn enough money to make a living, this is a price signal that has a meaning: it means that, for people, that art has more costs than benefits; i.e. in order to allow that art to be created, people would have to give up things that are more important. \(So the fact that only few artists are unable to make a living is not false but irrelevant\).
1.7.3.7. Pro: An UBI enables artists to live without the need to commodify their art so that it can be sold.
1.7.3.7.1. Pro: Many contemporary artists receive pressure from producers to alter their work to better appeal to a mainstream audience, against their own desires or creative vision.
1.7.3.7.2. Pro: The current economy is based on the assumption that the average human can sell their work at enough cost to sustain themselves . This may not be true in the future.
1.7.3.8. Pro: A UBI will enable artists to do what they do best rather than having to scrape by, spending most of their time working minimum wage jobs. The benefit to society is that we have an infusion of arts and culture.
1.7.3.9. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.7.
1.7.3.10. Pro: A UBI will help to subsidize independent and critical thought and thus help bring new ideas into fruition.
1.7.3.11. Pro: Our brain can be on either survival or creative mode. Our default is to be creative. As children, we have more creative thoughts and we are more curious. But as we grow and see our world, we switch to survival, which focuses on getting a job to buy food, and have shelter, etc. UBI takes care of the basic needs so we can switch back to creative thoughts which gives us a natural incentive to create and invent more wherever is needed. We would get our kick by seeing the world become a better place.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.12.7.
1.7.6. Con: If a contribution is valuable to society, then market forces will already define a fair price for such a contribution.
1.7.6.1. Con: In the case of America the market system specifically does not define a fair price for such a contribution due to skewed distribution of wealth and price influence.
1.7.6.1.1. Con: Further skewing the market by use of involuntary wealth transfers would exaggerate this problem rather than fixing it.
1.7.6.2. Con: If you solve a problem for a rich person "society" rewards you much more than if you solve a problem for a poor person. Even if your contribution toward the poor person had a greater impact on their life. For instance, tutoring a poor kid or tutoring a rich kid provides different rewards for the same contribution. \(tried to place the tutoring example as a pro, to separate things\)
1.7.6.2.1. Con: Directing resources to the already well resourced can be the most efficient investment. For example, if an expensive worker is delayed by one hour in getting to work, the lost production is much greater than if an inexpensive worker is delayed by the same time. Allocating a private car to the expensive worker may be justifiable even though allocating a private car to the less expensive worker would not be.
1.7.6.2.2. Con: The above claim falsely assumes that wealth is always unearned and concludes it unfair that a rich person can outbid a poor person. However, wealth is often earned, therefore the ability to outbid more for a contested resource must sometimes be acknowledged to be a reward for earlier effort.
1.7.6.3. Con: Market forces stop making sense when people stop being able to pursue the best value deals. When people are no longer players due to lack of funds, they are unable to reward contributions made available towards them.
1.7.6.4. Con: Many market failures exist. For example, a family member caring for an elderly person is not rewarded by the market, while paying a stranger to do so is.
1.7.6.5. Pro: A UBI removes the incentive to deliver precisely those goods and services most highly valued by individuals. The value of a good or service to an individual is only measurable by what that individual is willing to forego to attain it, namely, what they are willing to pay. By flattening the price disparities between different activities, a UBI will dilute the information contained in prices and lead to inefficient allocation of resources.
1.7.6.5.1. Con: The UBI is not paid to the product, but the person.
1.7.6.6. Pro: Individuals differ in their valuation of contributions. The market economy is the only means by which we may discover those valuations.  A "contribution to society" is meaningful and valuable only insofar as the members of that society are willing to pay for it.
1.7.6.6.1. Con: Roads are pretty valuable, yet society doesn't pay for them as part of a market economy.
1.7.6.6.2. Con: Police in general are pretty valuable, yet police that individuals pay for are called protection rackets, and are a determent to society.
1.7.6.6.2.1. Con: Actually, they're called "security firms" and are widely engaged. Protection racketeering is more along the lines of blackmailing victims with property damage and extorting money out of them on these grounds.
1.7.6.6.2.1.1. Con: Security firms work within the established framework of the law, have tons of oversight, and limited power —  they are basically the deputies of the goverment-run police and can't really be evaluated as an independent agency
1.7.6.6.3. Con: By the reasoning provided, intellectual property is not valuable. It would be better not to encourage the monopoly for any length of time. While some question the extent of our monopolies, most people see a little value in them.
1.7.6.6.4. Con: This statement highly values bribable officials. [Society](https://globalcompliancenews.com/anti-corruption/anti-corruption-laws-around-the-world/) tends not to overly care for them.
1.7.6.6.5. Con: Market exchange does not account for 'positive externalities' and 'negative externalities'.
1.7.6.7. Con: Market forces value the jobs that are harder to fill, not the jobs with the biggest contribution to society.
1.7.6.8. Con: In capitalist societies there are many instances where jobs that provide the least use value are rewarded with higher wages than those that provide intrinsic value.
1.7.6.8.1. Pro: Use value is a good or service that is intrinsically valuable, or at least an instrumental good not far removed from a good in itself. Occupations that deal in exchange values are those which mediate goods and services, but themselves are not productive; advertising etc.
1.7.6.9. Con: Many jobs exist where people perform them out of a sense of duty or vocation - these jobs are frequently poorly paid, because people are willing to endure low wages in order to work in their chosen field, and because it is felt that a better wage might encourage people to seek the job for the money rather than a "purer" reason. In some cases, such as teaching or nursing, people then leave the field in order to pursue better paid jobs, because they can no longer afford to follow their vocation.
1.7.7. Con: Since UBI is by definition unconditional, it cannot reward anything other than mere existence.
1.7.7.1. Con: Since UBI is unconditional it rewards all tasks that are not generally profitable, allowing a deeper cultural and scientific enrichment.
1.7.7.1.1. Con: A UBI does not reward anything. A reward, by definition, cannot be given unconditionally — it has to be contingent on some kind of achievement. People would receive the same payments, whether they did anything worthwhile or not: the engaged parent as much as the neglectful one, the dutiful homemaker as much as the messy person, the charitable volunteer as much as the video game addict.
1.7.7.1.1.1. Con: No individual, nor entity, should have the right to determine who is worthy of the basic means to live.
1.7.7.1.1.2. Con: The point that previous claims are making is that there are activities where the achievement is not immediately obvious, but in the long run they are highly valuable to society, and a UBI would serve as a mechanism to reward them.
1.7.7.1.2. Con: No evidence has been shown to prove that people will follow transcendental endeavors such as arts and science when their material needs are covered, instead of preferring leisure.
1.7.7.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.5.3.1.
1.7.7.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1.3.
1.7.7.2. Pro: Under a UBI, there is no guarantee that anyone would engage in meaningful tasks or even intellectual or artistic endeavors. Some might use the UBI to focus on inventions or the improvement of self or society, but others might equally use the UBI to complacently consume.
1.7.7.2.1. Con: Most intellectuals or artists aren't doing their work for a monetary reward \(as there is rarely much money to be made anyway\). Money is not necessarily a motivator for "meaningful" tasks; for example many compassionate people already use their free time to help others like the sick or the elderly.
1.7.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.5.3.1.
1.7.7.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1.3.
1.7.7.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.1.1.4.
1.7.7.2.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.4.4.
1.7.7.3. Pro: Rewards cannot be unconditional as a UBI is. To call it so is to distort the meaning of [reward](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reward).
1.7.7.3.1. Con: By "rewards," the previous claim effectively means "enables" or "provides compensation for." At present, a plethora of socially beneficial activities are not profitable and therefore uncompensated. In providing an unconditional fund to all persons, UBI enables all such activities by providing compensation for them.
1.7.7.3.1.1. Con: There is no reliable support or quantification of how much a UBI would actually "enable" these kinds of "socially beneficial activities," since the UBI would likely just be a very small sum of money. \(Consider that a UBI of around $10,000/year would cost 2–3 trillion dollars annually\)
1.7.7.3.1.2. Con: By definition, rewards must be granted after some event or accomplishment. Something that enables the accomplishment of a task necessarily comes before that task is started. So, you cannot use one word to mean the other. A UBI also does not provide compensation for any activity; it may enable activities but it doesn't reward them.
1.7.7.4. Con: -> See 1.7.7.3.1.
1.7.7.5. Con: Existence is a condition. And by some accounts, it is a condition that deserves to be rewarded. A person who changes that condition by committing suicide can be considered a net loss to society.
1.7.8. Con: "Meaningful contribution to society" is vague and ill define concept. To the extent economic policies incentivise certain behaviours they should do so in a targeted fashion to ensure the outcomes are positive and progress is measured relative to costs.
1.7.8.1. Con: Yes, it's a vague concept, but that's kind of the point. A number of activities that contribute to society, not only in wellbeing/community, but in solid economic gains, are undervalued. Childcare and aged care for example; or the arts. In contrast the current system, seems to incentivise only property barons, mining magnates, and telemarketers — often groups that actively detract from public good.
1.7.8.2. Con: The previous claim provided a number of examples that helped to clarify the broad category of "meaningful to society."
1.7.8.3. Con: There is much labor that is important — child care, art, charity, self-education and improvement — but is not compensated under the present form of capitalism. UBI would allow persons who raise children, create beauty, and do good works to sustain themselves without being forced to spend the majority of their time doing other jobs just to support themselves.
1.7.8.3.1. Con: The first beneficiary of self-education is oneself. If it is beneficial for also for a second party it can make a decision to sponsor the hopeful student. This ensures that the studies are progressing, as it costs funds. With unconditional UBI for all, this reality check won't work.
1.7.8.3.1.1. Con: Nobody and nothing exists in a vacuum - self-improvement and self-education will inevitably benefit one's neighbours as well, through processes as simple and basic as information and knowledge spreading through conversation, as well as whatever active uses the person puts their education, improvement and knowledge towards.
1.7.8.4. Con: A UBI will distribute the decision of what is meaningful work. Instead of having politicians decide what is "meaningful" and design policies that actually achieve the objective, you have lots of people with the ability to spend time/money on what they think is important. In that context it's not vague and ill defined, it's the average of the population's well-defined preferences.
1.7.9. Con: The State should pay people for particularly valuable contributions rather than pay everyone for \(potentially\) doing nothing.
1.7.9.1. Pro: A targeted welfare system is more able to account for this.
1.7.9.1.1. Pro: Specific benefits might be paid to single parents, or people working as caretakers for dependent family members.
1.7.9.2. Con: State actors rarely do well with picking which activities are useful or productive. Better to keep the state out of it and let the laws of basic economics and market forces guide such decisions.
1.7.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.12.1.3.3.1.
1.7.9.3. Con: There are many accidents that result in valuable contributions. Allowing anyone to be able to try allows more accidents to happen \(not to mention the intentional benefits\). If we don't support people trying and failing, we won't have enough trials to make any significant progress.
1.7.9.3.1. Con: There was no such support US during 19th or 20th centuries but the rate of both economic growth and innovation there was huge during most this centuries. There are plenty of other countries that enjoyed the high growth without having special support for failed entrepreneurs.
1.7.9.3.2. Pro: In many areas, "practice makes perfect" or at least has a positive relationship with quality of work produced. Permitting people to practice and indulge in areas of interest to them, even if it does not initially produce valuable goods, may permit valuable work to be produced in the future, or provide inspiration that may lead to societally beneficial innovation.
1.7.9.4. Con: There is likely to be a high amount of bureaucracy and fraud that would be involved in tracking every hour of care, cooking, helping out neighbours and then rewarding these actions.
1.7.9.5. Con: If someone would be otherwise engaged in criminal activity, doing nothing is in itself an improvement. UBI may well make those who would otherwise engage in crimes less desperate.
1.7.9.6. Con: It is impossible to track how many hours of reading and research and leisure, sometimes spread over decades, went into the making of one invention.
1.7.9.7. Pro: Even if the UBI rewards persons who currently perform unpaid \(but valuable\) contributions, such as artists or stay at home parents, it rewards everyone equally. Thus it is not a fair form of pay that recognises certain unpaid contributions are more valuable and laborious than others.
1.7.9.8. Pro: If society currently under-appreciates the contributions of important sources of unpaid labour, such as stay at home parents, a UBI may provide them some financial compensation but its universal nature denies them any form of specific recognition of their labour.
1.7.10. Con: Money is a reflection of the value of an item. By providing a basic income, we inject capital into the system without any work to support it. The only means to do this is to allow inflation by creating money out of thin air, or taking that money from those who have worked to create its value in the first place.
1.7.10.1. Con: Dollars are already created "out of thin air" by fractional reserve banking. Even if a UBI was funded by fiat funding, this could merely be replacing inflation profiting banks by inflation profiting society in general. There are several models of UBI, and at least one, proposed by Robert A Heinlein in "Beyond This Horizon" and "For Us, the Living" demonstrates this, using the replacement of fractional reserve banking with a form of [social credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_credit).
1.7.10.1.1. Pro: Injecting money into the economy by giving it to common people may have more positive consequences overall than doing so via banks.
1.7.10.1.1.1. Con: A universal rule of giving money to people who are capable to contribute work to the economy undermines the economy, thus the capability of society to give money to those who are not capable to do so.
1.7.10.1.2. Con: Douglas' ideas on [Social Credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_credit) do not appear to be well respected in the economics world, and are radical/questionable on their face. There is little to no support offered as to why this radical system should be accepted merely based on "someone wrote a book about it."
1.7.10.1.3. Con: Although fractional reserve banking can be misused, and the dollars *technically* are "created out of thin air," that is misleading. Fractional reserve banking is based on trust in good economic/investment decisions: banks use their expertise in business analysis to determine good investments from bad investments. Thus, service is supplied to compensate for the "new money," which limits "bad inflation" \(which occurs when the amount of money increases faster than value/welfare/wellbeing\).
1.7.10.1.4. Con: It is a myth that fractional banking "creates dollars our of thin air". Fractional banking merely prescribes how many real dollars a bank must hold to to ensure liquidity for dollar denominated deposits. Credit in a bank's book dollars is not the same as real dollars, it is still only credit exposed to \(in normal times: low\) credit risk.
1.7.10.2. Con: Money isn't a reflection of the value of an good, it is the reflection of the humam perception of the value of an good. That is why water along a river is priceless but water in the desert it is valuable. This statement was for a couple of centuries contested because it doesn't explained why the prices of goods changes, like bitcoins for example.
1.7.10.3. Pro: We cannot eat money. In hyperinflation people learn that money is but colourful paper slips of miniscule intrinsic value.
1.7.11. Con: What provides meaning to society often diverges from what provides meaning to an individual. Greed can provide intense meaning to an individual but provide no meaningful contributions to society.
1.7.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.
1.7.11.2. Con: Personal motivations are not necessarily antithetical to society - surely the amount of work done by volunteers for charities and endeavours such as Wikipedia and this site show that this does not need to be the case.
1.7.12. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.
1.7.13. Con: A UBI disincentives charitable giving and co-operating with others, because the program seeks to satiate the basic needs that charity and co-operation otherwise address. As such, a UBI will create increased selfishness and isolation in society.
1.7.13.1. Con: This would be true of any welfare system, not just UBI.
1.7.13.1.1. Con: A UBI would be far more extensive than existing welfare programs, and therefore disincentive charity and co-operation to a much greater extent.
1.7.13.1.2. Con: Yes, all welfare systems are bad. It's extra true for UBI because with most welfare systems there are gaps. So there are still some people who need charity. The point of UBI is to eliminate the need for all charity, so it will cause even more isolation.
1.7.13.2. Pro: Welfare systems have been show to disincentive charity, as comparisons between European countries and the United States [show](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/selfish-americans-more-charitable-than-europeans/).
1.7.13.3. Pro: There would be less incentive to co-operate with others to contribute to society if basic economic needs are automatically met.
1.7.13.4. Pro: Since people have already paid to help people they feel less of a need to help out with charity. They also have less money remaining after their money has been taken away by taxes. Giving to charity would be double.
1.7.13.5. Con: At best a UBI only sates basic needs within developed countries. In the rest of the world there would still be a clear need for charitable giving.
1.7.14. Pro: With basic livelihood guaranteed people will be more able to engage with politics and the democratic process.
1.7.14.1. Pro: A UBI ensures that no citizen is forced to choose between earning and income and exercising their democratic right to vote in an election.
1.7.14.2. Pro: Taking fewer shifts at work may allow people to vote or attend a town hall or a school board meeting. This allows lower income employees time to be more politically engaged in their communities so that they are better able to represent their own interests in government. [\(Berry 2012\)](https://politicsandculture.org/2012/05/02/leisure-the-sacred-gesture-and-human-dignity-thorstein-veblen-and-josef-piepers-understandings-of-leisure/)
1.7.14.2.1. Pro: Increased political engagement is good because it allows political forces to represent the people more easily. Increased political engagement will also help increase trust in government, leading to a better civil service.
1.7.14.2.2. Con: Lower income employees lack political representation due to the lobbying power that being wealthy brings, not because they lack the time to be politically engaged.
1.7.14.2.2.1. Con: Lobbying power is definitely not the only reason. [Turnout inequality](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/may/14/election2005.constitution) is a reality in most countries, thus regardless of the reasons \(though money and consequently time are probably among the factors\) the poor vote less and are less politically engaged.
1.7.14.2.2.2. Pro: Universal basic income will allow more people to lobby.
1.7.14.2.3. Con: Supplementing the income of higher-paid employees with a UBI \(since they would have received zero welfare beforehand\) gives them a greater ability to work less and increases their representation in government, which may work against the interests of lower income persons.
1.7.14.2.3.1. Con: High-paid employees usually have [high](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moneywisewomen/2012/03/21/average-america-vs-the-one-percent/#75150af22395) levels of [spending](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/25/wealthy-americans-living-paycheck-to-paycheck-income-paying-bills), therefore a UBI that is above the poverty line is unlikely to cover their lifestyle if they work less.
1.7.14.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.2.
1.7.14.2.3.3. Con: The relative value of the basic income depends on the recipient. For someone who lacks political and economic power, a supplement of $4000 might change their behaviour. Giving the same supplement to someone who earns more than $100k a year won't buy them any representation they don't already have.
1.7.14.3. Pro: A UBI would strengthen democracy. On the one hand, people would not feel as forgotten, but rather as a part of society. On the other hand since there would more free time - it would be a real oppurtunity to take part in democratic processes.
1.7.14.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.11.2.6.1.1.
1.7.14.3.2. Pro: Citizens would have more free time to become politically active/involved.
1.7.14.3.2.1. Pro: Engaged and involved citizens hold the government accountable and ensure that it is working in the people's best interests.
1.7.14.3.2.2. Con: Even if it'd be so most of them would rather be involved in quite passive ways - by reading the press, attending meetings with politicians etc. which could lead to an even further expansion of goverment control over them.
1.7.14.3.3. Pro: The disenfranchised might feel as though somebody actually cares about them, which might even encourage some of the more troubled people to seek help.
1.7.14.4. Pro: If sustainable, a UBI helps keep people invested in the society that is supporting them, leading to less likely chance of revolutionary action.
1.7.14.5. Pro: A UBI might encourage more and better civic engagement by lowering personal financial costs to core democratic activities \(not necessarily 'political' nor 'partisan'\) most notably Jury Duty, where current participation is subject to limitations by lost wages from participating at all, and speed is incentivized as well to minimize said lost wages by those who participate.
1.7.15. Pro: Many pilot UBI schemes have found that it not only improves upon income-dependent metrics \(such as health\) but that it [also increases social cohesion](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-santens/universal-basic-income-wi_b_8354072.html) through community empowerment and mobilisation.
1.7.15.1. Pro: Alaska's long-running UBI scheme has surely contributed to it having the highest rate of well-being of any State across indicators that [include social and community well-being](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/162029/file-2513997715-pdf/Well-Being_Index/2014_Data/Gallup-Healthways_State_of_American_Well-Being_2014_State_Rankings.pdf?t=1437575309454).
1.7.15.2. Pro: A UBI gives individuals the agency to invest in their own communities.
1.7.15.2.1. Con: The decision to invest in a community is a personal choice. A UBI does not guarantee the extra funds will be used towards renewing the community.
1.7.15.2.1.1. Pro: It is plausible an individual in a poorer community will use the extra funds from their UBI payments to move into a better quality community rather than to stay and make improvements.
1.7.15.2.1.2. Pro: For many individuals in poorer areas, they are surviving with minimal necessities. Funds from the UBI are more likely to go towards more urgent needs like food, shelter, and healthcare than the community at large.
1.7.15.2.1.2.1. Con: The fact that each poor individual is able to afford better food, better housing conditions or better healthcare will necessarily have a positive impact in the whole community.
1.7.15.2.2. Pro: Increased amounts of free time better allows individuals to invest their human capital in improving the community and helping other community members.
1.7.15.2.2.1. Con: It would be more effective simply to invest in those communities directly.
1.7.15.2.2.1.1. Con: Top down and hierarchical investment in communities, often driven by people that do not actually understand specific necessities, are less likely to result in valuable changes for the communities.
1.7.15.2.3. Con: It would be more effective simply to invest in those communities directly.
1.7.15.2.3.1. Pro: This way, it is easier to know the money invested is going towards directly improving the quality of life within these communities. Comparatively, with the UBI an individual can choose to use the extra income for other personal interests unrelated to improving the community.
1.7.15.2.3.1.1. Pro: This investment can go towards better housing, educational programs, and community initiatives that help to uplift the residents as a whole.
1.7.15.2.3.2. Con: Hierarchical investment in communities driven by people that don't actually live with the consequences of those investment decisions are less likely to result in community changes that the people in those communities would actually value for themselves.
1.7.15.2.4. Con: It equally gives them more time to engage in anti-social behavior, which is also supported by a UBI.
1.7.15.2.4.1. Con: This claim implies there is some inherent moral failing that applies to the economically disadvantaged and not to all other people with wealth. This is socially irresponsible.
1.7.15.2.4.2. Con: There is zero evidence that suggests people are more likely to engage in anti-social behavior than they are in positive community building efforts.
1.7.15.2.5. Pro: People who receive a UBI are more capable of contributing value than those who do not have an income above the poverty line.
1.7.15.2.5.1. Con: Giving individuals more agency to help also increases their ability to harm as well. You have given them a tool, there is no telling what they will do with it.
1.7.15.2.5.1.1. Con: This argues that the only thing that keeps people from destructive rampages is work. Work does not keep people from going on destructive rampages.
1.7.15.2.5.1.1.1. Con: An unemployed, economically strained populace can and frequently has lead to violent revolution and unrest against the Establishment. While work is not the only thing keeping people from lashing out, long-term economic hardship tends to be a major grievance that causes the populace to revolt.
1.7.15.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: A UBI would help to reduce long-term economic hardship in many cases.
1.7.15.2.5.1.1.1.2. Con: It is difficult to see how an UBI would create an unemployed, economically strained populace.
1.7.15.2.5.1.2. Con: As presented in other claims in this debate, there are reasons to believe the net effect would be positive.
1.7.15.2.5.2. Pro: Many people would provide voluntary work if they were more financially able and/or less busy/stressed.
1.7.15.2.6. Pro: Having to rely on government investment in local communities is problematic.
1.7.15.2.6.1. Pro: People in these communities lack the resource to lobby their local officials for change.
1.7.15.2.6.1.1. Pro: They don't have the time or the money to engage in the political process.
1.7.15.2.6.1.2. Pro: Given that many of the poor are disenfranchised, the government ignores their situation and has no incentive to invest in impoverished communities.
1.7.15.2.6.2. Pro: Governments are often less capable of understanding where aid is most needed.
1.7.15.2.6.2.1. Pro: Diverting welfare funds to a UBI helps these people buy the goods that they do actually need.
1.7.15.2.6.2.2. Pro: Governments often do not include members of these communities.
1.7.15.2.6.2.2.1. Pro: The impact of this is that even if politicians then wanted to help members of these communities, their attempts to do so would be inefficient at best, and actively harmful at worst, as they do not understand the needs and concerns of the people living in these areas.
1.7.15.2.6.3. Con: [The freerider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem) makes individual investment in the community harder. The central, coercive, coordinating mechanism of the government is necessary to make community projects work.
1.7.15.2.6.3.1. Con: Freeriding is vastly outweighed because people feel the urgency to change the unequal systems that currently exist.
1.7.15.2.7. Pro: Under a UBI, investment within communities would better enable a process of organic change.
1.7.15.2.7.1. Pro: UBI policies shift the provision of welfare from a national level to a local level, where individuals are more capable of investing in their communities.
1.7.15.2.7.1.1. Pro: With money from a UBI, individuals within at-risk communities have the ability to invest in fixing urgent problems in areas the government has not helped \(e.g. [Flint, Michigan water crisis](http://time.com/4269300/flint-task-force-report-water-crisis/)\).
1.7.15.2.7.1.2. Pro: People are more responsible for investments they believe serve their own interests.
1.7.15.2.7.1.3. Pro: It is easier for individuals to petition local institutions and local leaders for change.
1.7.15.2.7.1.3.1. Pro: Local community leaders are closer and more reachable to people than national politicians.
1.7.15.2.7.1.3.2. Pro: Local leaders are heavily involved in the community, which makes them accountable not only to their community but also to themselves.
1.7.15.2.7.1.4. Pro: Leadership in local institutions is based on real abilities to manage money, instead of connections and nepotism \(which is usual at higher levels\). This happens because citizens have an interest in ensuring their community's success.
1.7.15.2.7.1.4.1. Con: Leadership of local government is often deeply unaccountable, due to the low stakes of the powers that they have, and the inability of media organisations to individually scrutinise each local government. As a result, corruption can flourish at a local level even when it would quickly be stamped out at a national level.
1.7.15.2.7.1.4.2. Con: Citizens have an interest in ensuring the success of their country, state, province or city, too. It is unclear why this would be stronger for very local government than for more powerful and higher-ranking government bodies.
1.7.15.2.7.2. Pro: Individuals that live and work in these communities best understand the needs of these communities. As such, they are able to prioritize which areas to invest in first and how to go about investing in the community.
1.7.15.2.8. Pro: The UBI provides individuals with more money to buy goods from local businesses. This leads to more money circulating in these communities and contributes to their economic revitalization.
1.7.15.2.8.1. Con: A UBI does not guarantee that individuals will use this additional money within their own communities. It is plausible that an individual will continue to shop online or outside of the community for certain goods and services.
1.7.15.2.8.2. Pro: Welfare policy often forces consumers to buy goods from non-local private companies that the government associates with.
1.7.15.2.9. Pro: When individuals invest more in their communities and buy goods from local businesses, they flourish and private investors are more willing to invest in them [\(Greenup 2015\)](http://www.geektime.com/2015/12/17/how-a-universal-basic-income-could-fuel-entrepreneurship/).
1.7.15.2.10. Pro: A UBI would give more people the time to focus on others; earning extra money would be optional and desirable to many but many would be happy to exist on the UBI and help others - either individuals \(eg: carers\) or the wider population.
1.7.15.2.10.1. Pro: Altruistic individuals would be more able to put forward charity or other altruistic forms of work without having to worry about their own maintenance or profitability.
1.7.15.2.11. Pro: A UBI can be a great method to facilitate full expression of individual potentials especially in communities where there is a large disparity of control and ownership of commodity resources among the members.
1.7.15.3. Con: A UBI may only exacerbate existing tendencies in social cohesion. In relatively communal countries it may build ties; [but in individualistic ones it may actually increase the level of individualism](https://www.opendemocracy.net/transformation/max-harris/will-universal-basic-income-make-us-lonely).
1.7.15.4. Con: Providing all citizens with the means to be self-sufficient decreases the need for individuals to engage with the community through work.
1.7.15.4.1. Con: Even if citizens do not engage with the community through work, there are many other ways: local associations, volunteering, leisure activities, sport, local festivities, etc.
1.7.15.5. Con: Redirecting welfare spending from community services \(such as [soup kitchens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup_kitchen) or free healthcare clinics\) towards individual income supplements would erode much community infrastructure that builds ties between strangers.
1.7.15.5.1. Con: When every citizen has the means to pay for food, education or healthcare, some of these services are no longer necessary.
1.7.15.6. Pro: A UBI will afford those with lower incomes more flexibility, which can allow them to organize politically. You could consider it a "strike fund" that allows labor and citizens to advocate for themselves.
1.7.15.7. Con: Pilots are not universal. Basic income works well for small populations that benefit from the 'hard' economy in the rest of the world, and in developing countries where income is very low.
1.7.16. Con: A person can only perform such meaningful contributions if society provides them the chance and capability to. It could be possible that when a UBI is implemented, governments might limit certain activities.
1.7.16.1. Pro: One example is higher education. The government might not feel that it is worth maintaining universities if people do not get jobs out of them due to a UBI. This would mean that fewer schools are created and thus people have less access to higher education.
1.7.17. Pro: By de-stigmatizing being out of paid employment, a UBI would encourage a value shift towards putting less value on financial success and more on a person's contribution to society.
1.7.17.1. Con: It wouldn't de-stigmatize being out of paid employment, that person would still be considered a leech on society because society has to go to work and do something worthwhile so that person can do whatever it is they're doing that has such a low value to society that no one will pay them for it.
1.7.17.2. Con: The current stigma on "unemployment" isn't on the classical economic definition of unemployed, i.e. not having a job but being willing to work. The stigma is on people who don't have a job, don't want one, and collect unemployment payments. Stay at home parents are not stigmatized \(at least not for this reason\) even though they don't have a traditional job, and don't want one, because they don't collect payments.
1.7.17.2.1. Con: The stigma is also on people who lost their jobs, cannot find a new one, have to perform undignifying reporting to welfare stations, getting monitored, etc.
1.7.18. Con: Only a certain percentage of a given population would be interested in participating in these higher, social level activities. Some percentage of the population will seek a path of least resistance, and rely on the UBI exclusively. This group of people, who do not naturally take up hobbies or engage in the community, find themselves in a life where they're not really required for society to function, and must face the realities of a very bleak existence void of purpose and urgency.
1.7.18.1. Con: Many people who are unable to participate in the labor force effectively currently find themselves in a bleak existence, one that UBI would make less bleak.
1.7.19. Con: In this context, a UBI transfers the risk of failure of individuals engaged in these endeavors to the public. The taxpayer should not have to fund people who choose to pursue fields in which they are not qualified to make a living.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.6.11.2.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.
1.11. Pro: A UBI will help the labor market adapt to inevitable disruptions caused by advancements in automation and artificial intelligence.
1.11.1. Con: A UBI is used as a way of merely making [techno-capitalism](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/16/universal-basic-income-equality-tech-silicon-valley) — a system that fuels inequalities \([Suarez-Villa, p. 162](https://books.google.es/books?id=UjMHDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=technocapitalism+and+inequality&source=bl&ots=Iej_CriTK6&sig=eB_Qycqzfe2b7lS6RswdkJyr7FA&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL7-DeuojUAhWJjCwKHVhaAcYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=technocapitalism%20and%20inequality&f=false)\) — more tolerable for people, instead of addressing the root causes of exploitation and economic inequality.
1.11.1.1. Pro: Silicon Valley [strongly supports](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/22/silicon-valley-universal-basic-income-y-combinator) a UBI.
1.11.1.1.1. Pro: [Silicon Valley's](https://www.wired.com/2017/03/silicon-valley-lawmakers-1-trillion-plan-save-trump-country/) congressional representative Ro Khanna has proposed a 1 trillion dollar earned income tax credit expansion as a form of basic income, doubling the income going to low-income families.
1.11.1.1.2. Con: Appeal to authority is logical fallacy. Silicon Valley's support doesn't provide justification, as they are neither political, nor economic experts.
1.11.1.1.2.1. Pro: A motive for Silicon Valley to support UBI can simply be explained by the notion that Silicon Valley just wants everyone to be able to buy their products.
1.11.1.1.2.2. Pro: The motive does not gel either. By pushing for a UBI, they are also pushing for a higher general tax rate on themselves.
1.11.1.1.2.3. Con: If one takes a free market approach to equality and growth then one must accept that Silicon Valley \(representing a huge market share of automation\) must be a source of good 'knowledge' on such a topic in a free market.
1.11.1.1.3. Con: The fact that Silicon Valley supports UBI is a given since they are the main drivers behind the techo-capitalism and would thus, reasonably, support policies supporting its continued growth.
1.11.1.1.4. Con: This is conformation bias. A number of local governments and organisations strongly support UBI and have no interest in techno-capitalism.
1.11.1.2. Con: If techno-capitalism provides the impetus to implement an effective universal welfare system, that would help address economic inequality directly.
1.11.1.2.1. Con: Actually, income inequality might increase with a UBI because there would be no more societal pressure to create meaningless jobs. Which means there will be an automation boom and significantly fewer jobs; meaning income inequality would actually increase. So, while covering the basic needs of the majority of the population would certainly pacify it, the political and relative economic power of the vast majority would be greatly reduced.
1.11.1.2.1.1. Pro: This would divide society into two camps, those solely reliant on UBI and those working or owning along with a UBI. That is, the powerful and the weak whom face an uphill battle maintaining rights and power balance in the long term. Specifically, jobs become scarcer and capital is more concentrated due to growing tech monopolies and automation. On such a trajectory any safe guards fall by the wayside where convenient for elites.
1.11.1.2.1.1.1. Con: We already have those classes, and the problems that come with them, it's just right now the weaker class gets nothing.
1.11.1.3. Con: It might provide people with time to rally and create movements to solve inequality. The security provided by a basic income could allow people to become politically more vocal since they'd perhaps be less cautious about publicly holding a belief/opinion opposed to that of their bosses.
1.11.1.4. Con: Basic income would still have merits if it helps during the transition to a post-scarcity stage where we wouldn't even need money.
1.11.1.5. Con: Those root causes are much easier to address once everyone is able to stop losing sleep over not having a stable living income; which can be provided by way of a UBI.
1.11.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.4.
1.11.1.7. Con: The fact that a UBI is not a universal panacea is not an argument against a UBI.
1.11.1.7.1. Con: But it's not just that it's not a cure all, it actually creates new problems. The newest problem is that affordability will not be fixed, and the rich will still get richer by simply hiking prices of goods.
1.11.1.8. Con: While there may be structural inequalities in varying degrees \(depends on the country\), the fact is people are not equally skilled and success \(as measured in whatever way\) tends to accumulate to a small set of individuals. In this sense you can't take away all the causes of inequalities no matter what you do.
1.11.1.8.1. Con: Inequality is not the only problem a UBI is intended to address; absolute poverty and related illnesses and fatalities are also a critical issue a UBI would go a great way towards addressing.
1.11.1.9. Pro: A UBI designed by the current ruling class as a way to prolong the current socio-economic order \(infinite growth, profit-incentivised, private property, competitive based capitalism\) does not take into account the immediate problems with respect to the destruction of the environment, including global warming, pollution, biodiversity loss, etc. Any UBI implemented should be designed by the society as a whole as a means of transitioning to a post-reinforced-scarcity socio-economic system.
1.11.1.10. Pro: The root cause of inequality and affordability needs to be addressed. Otherwise, UBI is but another form of subsidy, loan and minimum wage increase, that makes no guarantee that living is affordable and allows landlords, food providers, gas providers to get rich at the expense of UBI funding sources.
1.11.1.11. Con: The emergence of the internet has turned the average citizen into a source of income for many corporations that essentially sell your identity to advertisers. A UBI would be a reasonable and necessary redistributive structure in light of our current economic framework.
1.11.1.11.1. Con: The general refusal to pay for Internet services resulting in the monetization of user data is not justification for mandating that the services make less money.
1.11.1.12. Pro: A UBI forces humanity into the model where we look to competitive markets and top-down institutions for basic human needs. With automation removing most future jobs, people need to look outside of these systems for long term solutions yet implementing a UBI obstructs this.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.18.1.2.
1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.1.
1.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.2.
1.11.5. Con: A UBI removes the ability of the government to fund meaningful programs to help individuals become more productive, such as technical training and higher education.
1.11.5.1. Con: There is no reason a UBI would interfere with such programs. Each can be considered seperately.
1.11.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.11.2.
1.11.5.1.2. Pro: Education and training programs are rarely \(if ever\) viewed as welfare programs.
1.11.5.2. Pro: The UBI might not actually remove this ability to fund, but this may be used as a justification by politicians opposed to such a program. It serves as a way to punish the poor, rather than to meaningfully resolve any actual issue.
1.11.6. Con: This is also true of any other social support network.
1.11.6.1. Con: Other social support networks often don't cater to certain groups. For example religious groups who used to fulfill this role are less likely to support atheists.
1.11.6.1.1. Con: Government social support networks do not have this problem. That would be a breach of the 14th Amendment.
1.11.6.1.2. Con: A Christian who follows the teachings of Christ would not turn away an atheist in need. Individuals  don't have to agree with each other in order to support each other.
1.11.6.1.2.1. Con: Not all religions are Christianity, and not all Christians agree on how to follow the teachings of Christ, nor do all Christians actively and effectively follow said teachings.
1.11.6.2. Con: Other social support networks may be insufficient to support the wholesale retraining of a segment of the population whose job was obsoleted by technology because these support networks are designed to help people in between jobs, with the expectation that other similar jobs would be available in the future. Not so with technology-led obsolescence.
1.11.6.3. Pro: [Workers' Compensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_compensation) is a social support network.
1.11.7. Pro: UBI is necessary to combat the fact that AI will be able to do any task better than humans, physical and cognitive. Unlike the previous industrial revolution, both physical and mental jobs will be replaced.
1.11.7.1. Pro: Society will reach a point where general artificial intelligences will be able to learn at a faster rate than humans, thus rendering human labor inefficient and economically impractical.
1.11.7.1.1. Pro: This can already been seen with IBM's artificial intelligence system, [Watson](http://time.com/4960778/computers-smarter-than-humans/). It has the increasing ability to learn and to solve problems that are too complex to maintain in the human mind.
1.11.7.2. Con: The technological singularity is not a 'fact' at all. It is a hypothesised possibility of a future we might live in.
1.11.7.3. Pro: As AI increases, more and more jobs will become obsolete. UBI will only make sense at this point since the majority of people will not be able to make an 'honest' living anymore.
1.11.7.4. Pro: A UBI would enable AI to do work that no longer should be done by humans - binary, repetitive, programmable. This frees humans to do work which is creative, exploratory, self fulling, voluntary, for remuneration of not is their choice as they have a basic income to fulfill basic needs.
1.11.7.4.1. Con: This is pro is contingent on having efficient and useful AI tools to achieve a rational savings enough to create a universal income. Current machine learning allows us to have high level of sales development tools and makerting web software. While the advancements of ecommerce is a popular idea to suggest the removal of work forces and thus rationalize a UBI, there could be more jobs available for people to work that as a result of AI.
1.11.7.5. Pro: This claim does not necessarily rely on the singularity but on the fact that as technology increases the productive capacity of each individual, there will come a time where two trends intersect- first a relatively small number of workers will be able to produce sufficient goods for society and second that there will be a significant number of people who are incapable of developing the skills needed to be economically viable. A UBI is needed if 20% of the population is not economically useful.
1.11.7.6. Pro: Consumers are also workers, so if there are no workers, there are no consumers. A UBI provides money to consumers to keep the economy going, when all the work is automated. The economy exists to provide goods and services to consumers, they are therefore the primary source of money in the economic cycle. [Elon Musk: Automation Will Force Universal Basic Income](https://www.geek.com/tech-science-3/elon-musk-automation-will-force-universal-basic-income-1701217/)
1.11.8. Con: Automation is not bound to a certain place. Given a UBI will require higher taxes, which in turn encourages businesses to outsource automated production, the economy and labour market of the country providing the UBI could suffer.
1.11.8.1. Con: Automation [usually decreases outsourcing](http://www.nearshoreamericas.com/blameautomation-outsourcing-contract-decreases-sharply-report/).
1.11.8.1.1. Con: This is due to the environment in which most studies were performed: developed countries who outsource to countries with cheap human labour. The new scenario talks about companies leaving highly developed country A because B offers the same level of advanced technologies without the extra taxes required for UBI.
1.11.8.2. Pro: Automation increases output. A steady production rate is easier to obtain with automation rather than manual labor. Read the story of "John Henry" to capture the concept.
1.11.8.2.1. Con: Automation does not increase output. Increasing marginal productivity increases output. Consider the marginal situation where a machine and a worker are equally efficient at a task.  Only if one is more efficient than the other is productivity increased. Steady production is irrelevant to output.
1.11.8.2.1.1. Con: Machinery has the potential to work faster and more consistently than a worker. The above point stands if the machine and worker are equally efficient and work equal hours, but it's likely that is not the situation.
1.11.8.3. Con: Not in the case of automated vehicles where taxi drivers and truck drivers would lose jobs to self driving vehicles.  This automation would not be out sourced to any other country.
1.11.8.4. Con: Automation of specific tasks \(such as menial labour - think housekeeping, shelf stacking and so on\) is very location dependent and will decimate the local labour market, providing a UBI will safeguard against the excess of unemployed as the total job pool begins to shrink faster than new jobs can be feasibly created.
1.11.8.4.1. Con: A surprising amount of human intuition and common sense goes into such "menial" tasks, so they will not be rapidly replaced by automation; there will be a transition period at the very least.
1.11.8.4.2. Pro: Automation of many tasks \(and soon professions\) that people felt "safe" is already in process. Automated haulage is less than three years out, [which is set to disrupt over 1.5m jobs](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/16/self-driving-trucks-automation-jobs-trucking-industry) between the loss of haulage drivers and the economy that has built up around them in the US alone.
1.11.8.5. Con: This assumes that production will be taxed, which is not necessarily the case.
1.11.8.6. Con: This assumes that this is requires an increase in the tax burden. It will be most probably a shift in the tax burden that will not impact the location of production.
1.11.8.6.1. Con: This is assertive in nature. It is necessary to elaborate a bit more on why it is more probable that there will be a shift in tax burden than an increase in the burden in general.
1.11.8.7. Con: This assumes that you would tax production, when in fact you should tax income. Because of reduced costs, due to automation and outsourcing, businesses would have much higher incomes and therefore they would pay much higher taxes. This makes the location of automated production irrelevant when the businesses need to report their income regardless of the place the production is made.
1.11.8.8. Con: There is an assumption here which does not make perfect sense. There is no real argument behind "a UBI will require higher taxes": speaking only on the accounting side, it all depends on the amount of UBI.
1.11.9. Pro: The government has an obligation to ensure all citizens have the capacity to fulfill basic needs such as food, housing, education and healthcare. A UBI allows states to provide this basic level of welfare despite a fluctuating job market.
1.11.9.1. Pro: A UBI fulfills this obligation, while also maintaining individuals' ability to make choices and have control over their own lives \(unlike some forms of targeted welfare\).
1.11.9.1.1. Con: Individuals never have absolute choice in any society; our choices are constrained in the particular instance where they conflict with others' interests \(e.g. limitations on free speech\), or where they gave up their interests \(e.g. through taxation\) to enable our choices.
1.11.9.1.2. Con: As the state is the caretaker of collectivity, it ought to prioritize the efficient expenditure of taxpayers' money in the aggregate, over the marginal exercise of choice.
1.11.9.1.3. Con: Individuals are not stripped of all choice under a targeted welfare system. Individuals have a basis of good health, sufficient savings and education to make choices that significantly improve their quality of life \(e.g. taking a part-time vocational degree to upgrade skills\).
1.11.9.1.4. Con: Some individuals would [spend poorly,](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-12-04/four-reasons-a-guaranteed-income-won-t-work) making it necessary to reinstate various welfare programs to help these people make better financial decisions.
1.11.9.1.4.1. Pro: Reinstating welfare programs would effectively double everyone’s tax bill and eliminate any purported cost savings that Government might claim from implementing the UBI.
1.11.9.1.4.1.1. Con: Given the sheer cost of implementing a UBI, it is unlikely that both a UBI and more traditional welfare programs will be run at the same time.
1.11.9.1.4.2. Pro: It is better for the government to provide a social safety net as individuals don't accurately consider future risks.
1.11.9.1.4.2.1. Pro: Governments have a paternalistic obligation to force individuals to devote their resources towards their safety and health. For example, that is the reason for seatbelt laws.
1.11.9.1.4.2.2. Pro: Individuals might be likely to spend a cash bonus, not anticipating a future harm \(e.g. unexpected illness\). However, if the government provides welfare or subsidized healthcare, this protects individuals from unanticipated harms.
1.11.9.1.4.2.3. Con: People should have the agency to determine their own lives, even if that means that sometimes they will not make the most optimal choice.
1.11.9.1.4.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.
1.11.9.1.4.3. Pro: Some individuals, especially in societies like India or China where expenditure on status symbols is accepted as a practice, would be tempted to expend on largesse e.g. feasts for distant relatives or showy cars, despite it having little utility other than showing off.
1.11.9.1.4.3.1. Con: It seems paternalistic to reject an entire policy for thinking that particular cultures will spend it poorly.
1.11.9.1.4.3.2. Pro: Even if they may not spend it on ostentatious consumption, the likelihood is there - given that individuals in such situations face societal pressures to choose poorly, the state cannot assume that choice would be all that rational or beneficial.
1.11.9.1.4.4. Pro: Some individuals, especially those in poverty who are used to purchasing cheap but comparatively less nutritious meals e.g. pre-packed or fast food, might not be incentivized to change their habits as much as they would if their food stamps were only applicable to fresh foods or “Healthy Choice” labeled meals.
1.11.9.1.4.5. Pro: At-risk families will spend on cigarettes, drugs or alcohol instead of saving up for children’s education or spending on subsidized vocational training courses. This situation is comparatively less likely with in-kind assistance than with a UBI.
1.11.9.1.4.5.1. Con: Households on welfare [statistically do not waste](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/do-poor-waste-transfers-booze-and-cigarettes-no) their income on alcohol and cigarettes. This perception is generally just scare-mongering from conservative groups.
1.11.9.1.4.5.1.1. Con: Even if the majority of individuals on welfare do not spend their money on alcohol and cigarettes, the prevalent perception is that there is a risk that they might do so with a UBI.
1.11.9.1.4.5.1.2. Con: Even if a tiny fraction of a UBI beneficiaries do abuse it, it only takes one sensationalist [news](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4076338/The-bizarre-benefit-frauds-2016-including-woman-claiming-superpowers-BLIND-driver.html) story to enable rhetoric against the policy and, more harmfully, against its most vulnerable recipients.
1.11.9.1.4.5.2. Con: Welfare programs perpetuate the stigma that sees being poor as equivalent to being unable to make good decisions or adequately look after yourself or your family.
1.11.9.1.4.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.9.1.4.5.1.
1.11.9.1.4.5.2.2. Con: The stigma against individuals in poverty exists for a multitude of other reasons, for example lack of familiarity with other cultures or lack of exposure to minority friends.
1.11.9.1.4.5.2.2.1. Con: This stigma or [otherness](https://othersociologist.com/otherness-resources/) exists even in societies that are not racially or culturally diverse, indicating that it has little to do with these things.
1.11.9.1.4.5.2.3. Con: What can eliminate stigma is a removal of the perceived costs the poor place upon the middle-class taxpayers, and welfare is more constrained such that the poor structurally cannot make bad choices.
1.11.9.1.4.5.3. Con: The use of alcohol and drugs is usually strongly linked to the[mental health impacts that result from being poor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3449359/). A UBI will actually alleviate this phenomenon.
1.11.9.1.4.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.2.1.1.
1.11.9.1.4.6. Con: This happens in any welfare system where people are allowed to control how they allocate the resources the State gives them.
1.11.9.1.4.6.1. Con: Under a UBI, more individuals - especially those in poverty with substantial pressures affecting their decision calculus - have more income with which to potentially make poor decisions. Under means testing or in-kind assistance, fewer poor decisions will be made on aggregate.
1.11.9.1.4.7. Con: Most states will retain compulsory state-funded education systems to educate young people about sensible ways to spend their UBI payment. This kind of education allows for the provision of advice and support, while maintaining the dignity and autonomy of individuals.
1.11.9.1.4.7.1. Con: Given the high rates of absenteeism, and because the school system educates children \(not their parents who receive UBI payments\) state education is unlikely to guarantee that people will spend their UBI payments sensibly.
1.11.9.1.4.7.2. Con: Much of education-related welfare is concentrated on keeping low-income children in school \(e.g. [No Child Left Behind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act)\). The Government would likely remove these welfare programmes to fund a UBI. Hence, on the educational advocacy level, UBI and better public education are at least partially mutually exclusive.
1.11.9.1.4.7.2.1. Con: Even if some education-welfare programs are eliminated, if a country has a strong public education that does not necessarily change with the implementation of a [UBI](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/universal-basic-income-finland-ubi-test-scheme-experiment-a7211241.html). That is the case of [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Finland), for example.
1.11.9.1.4.7.3. Con: Poor spending choices are often the result of coercion or manipulation that cannot be solved by education. Empowering those in poverty with a UBI payout is likely to embolden these oppressive actors, and put those in poverty at a greater risk of manipulation.
1.11.9.1.4.7.3.1. Pro: A stable UBI in the hands of the financially illiterate is a beacon that draws in predatory loansharks or bogus employment middlemen. The advantage of a layer of bureaucracy with means-testing or in-kind assistance is that the Government's audit processes serve as additional check and balance to protect the financially illiterate.
1.11.9.1.4.7.3.1.1. Con: Governments ensure - through various methods - that the conditions for receiving welfare are met, yet that does not prevent people who receive welfare from being the prey of loansharks, scams or any other dubious enterprises.
1.11.9.1.4.8. Con: The mentioned group is not big enought to make an argument. Even if such group people do have to spend money on survival, only a part \(probably small\) of money will be wasted.
1.11.9.1.5. Con: The government has no mandate to provide any sort of welfare at all.
1.11.9.1.5.1. Con: The government has a moral obligation to ensure a basic humane quality of life for those under its care.
1.11.9.2. Con: The obligation on government is to ensure all citizens are able to meet their basic needs. That does not automatically prescribe a UBI as the chosen mechanism to do so. Targeted welfare and in-kind subsidies can do the same - at less extravagant cost.
1.11.9.3. Con: Many of the underlying causes of poverty, such as failing schools, substandard public services or institutionalized racism, are not addressed by a UBI.
1.11.9.3.1. Pro: Funds would be better allocated towards reversing or mitigating these deeply entrenched issues.
1.11.9.3.2. Pro: Since a UBI would tie up a significant amount of government funding, it is unreasonable for the government to assume that they can fix these deeper issues while simultaneously paying for a UBI.
1.11.9.4. Con: The government is responsible to ensure every person has the capacity to fulfill basic needs. Providing those needs is not within the mandate of the government.
1.11.9.5. Con: This is not an argument for a UBI; this is merely an opinion on what is the role of the state and description of UBI. This is not an explanation of why it would be good or bad.
1.11.10. Con: A UBI will not help the market adapt. It will actually make it slower to adapt because there is a buffer/cushion to absorb the shock and lessens the incentive to adapt to new conditions. Pain, not comfort, brings about adaptation and changes in the correction amount and direction.
1.11.10.1. Con: Incentives to new conditions are irrelevant if the new conditions are impossible for human workers to adapt to, as may well be the case for AI/machine automation.
1.11.10.2. Con: Excessive pain can overwhelm individuals rather than forcing adaptation, leading to mental and physical illnesses, and potentially deaths.
1.11.10.3. Con: Pain is undesirable under many moral frameworks \(e.g. utilitarianism, humanism\) and therefore other motivators for adaptation should be used, while strategies which reduce pain \(such as a UBI\) should be implemented where their downsides are manageable.
1.11.11. Pro: In a digitalized world, the data that every individual provides is valuable but they receive little or no compensation for this data. A UBI would compensate individuals for this contribution to society.
1.11.12. Con: By removing opposition to automation, UBI could increase the rate of job loss. The faster this happens, the more chance there is of destabilising society as vast swathes of the population become unemployed and lose routine and purpose in their life.
1.11.12.1. Con: Routine and purpose can be achieved outside of an income-generating job.
1.11.12.2. Con: Many people do not feel a sense of purpose in their current jobs, and find them a bothersome rather than comforting routine.
1.11.12.3. Con: Underemployed \(especially casually employed\) people do not find either a sense of routine or purpose in their jobs, as their continuing employment is uncertain and/or does not provide enough money to reliably subsist on.
1.11.13. Pro: Significant disruptions in the labour market are inevitable. A UBI is necessary to reduce the harm of these disruptions.
1.11.13.1. Con: The presumption that technological change will inexorably create pressure on employment is not demonstrated while economic history suggests higher global productivity is not detrimental to strong employment. This tends to make UBI pointless in that respect.
1.11.13.1.1. Con: A UBI would not create redundant jobs, but rather allow people a better chance to find or create a needed job.
1.11.13.1.2. Con: A UBI could be beneficial to absorb the short term changes in the labor market dynamic, even if in the long term society would be able to adapt without UBI.
1.11.13.2. Con: There is still a scarcity of resources–technology isn't advanced enough to produce everything–making markets necessary, making human labor necessary. Removing market incentives by redistributing wealth will cause an undersupply of labor.
1.11.13.2.1. Con: This is the first time in human history where resources on a global scale are not scarce, just unequally held/distributed.
1.11.13.2.1.1. Con: Virtually no resource is infinite so they have the quality of “scarcity” even when their amount or accessibility has increased.
1.11.13.2.2. Con: If UBI will cause an undersupply of labor as claimed then wages will go up to get the needed labor. That's exactly the goal of UBI; increase wages above that needed for basics like housing, food, clothing, healthcare, etc. The amount of UBI has to be linked to a basic standard of living but not so high as to be detrimental to economic growth.
1.11.13.3. Con: Our society is not yet capable of the level of automated production required to sustain UBI. Nor do we, yet, have a level of unemployment resulting from automated production that would warrant the implementation of UBI.
1.11.13.3.1. Con: Automated production is not required for UBI. Whilst the growth of automation may lead to greater unemployment, a "sufficient" level of unemployment isn't a requirement for it to be a benefit. Nor is a certain level of automation needed to finance it: whilst automation would represent a concentration of money in the hands of capital, the existing structures could finance UBI in place of means-tested welfare.
1.11.13.3.2. Pro: While a UBI might have merit if and when when automation has eliminated most human labour, it is decades too early to implement a UBI. Government economic policies with huge effects on taxation and the incentive to work should not be implemented until there is a pressing need.
1.11.13.3.2.1. Con: We are well on our way to wide-spread job loss as a result of automation. [Some reports](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/11/29/automation-could-kill-73-million-u-s-jobs-2030/899878001/) say that the United States will face job losses of up to 73 million within the next 12 years \(by 2030\).
1.11.13.3.2.1.1. Pro: If the plans to take care of aging population are not put in place soon, the pace of disruption with AI and Automation will create havoc with their lives. UBI is a fair and predictable vehicle.
1.11.13.3.2.1.2. Con: The cited report mentions job loss, but not net job loss. In the same article, it mentions that the real challenge will be retraining workers to perform new jobs that will be created.
1.11.13.3.3. Con: -> See 1.11.13.3.2.1.
1.11.13.3.4. Con: Today is it very difficult for even highly-educated, experienced, hard-working people to get jobs. Currently we have about 22% unemployment rate in the US: [www.shadowstats.com](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/unemployment-charts) You can also visit LinkedIn to view countless stories of qualified candidates looking for 1+ years with no success.
1.11.13.3.5. Con: Given the current wealth disparities in developed countries a more proper distribution of income would indeed render a UBI affordable.
1.11.13.3.6. Con: Production does not have to be automated to sustain UBI, only efficient. Unemployment would be very high if not for existing UBI alternatives put in place without a conscious public debate. We increased red tape and regulation to slow the increases in production efficiency, dramatically increased jobs of servitude, and increased lowest level marketing jobs. A UBI addresses the pressures that created these trends, allowing waste to be rolled back and fruits of efficiency to be broadly shared.
1.11.13.3.7. Con: If we wait until there is widespread job loss, it is already too late. Preventative maintenance in the form of UBI would benefit the government in the long run, as all of those people who are unemployed due to automation will be relying on government assistance to survive. It’s far more affordable to streamline a single program than to rely on ten different ones.
1.11.13.4. Con: Existing mechanisms — such as retraining and reeducation — have been sufficient for society as a whole to adapt to previous changes in technology and work culture.
1.11.13.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.14.1.3.1.2.
1.11.13.4.2. Con: In the past this was indeed possible, but the jobs taken by technology are many and they are usually complex. It would be like asking a shoemaker to reeducate as a mathematician. It would only be possible when provided with the financial freedom of UBI.
1.11.13.4.2.1. Con: Skill retraining requires an education system capable of understanding which skills are going to be necessary and valuable tomorrow.
1.11.13.4.2.1.1. Con: True, although there are ways to forecast what skills will have high value.
1.11.13.4.3. Con: Workers would need a UBI to support them while they go through retraining and reeducation.
1.11.13.4.4. Con: In the past, it was true to that that retraining could help, but the pace and quantity of job destruction now from automation means that at some point, the differential between job loss and creation won't be recoverable. The idea of requiring a job to pay for the right to live will become more and more antiquated.
1.11.13.4.5. Con: Relying on an already out-dated and, entirely obsolete school system to train you for the workforce 'like the good ol' days' will not do anymore. People don't care if you have a piece of paper saying you have studied something.
1.11.13.4.5.1. Pro: More and more employers are looking for experienced workers. If you want to get experience before getting a job you might start personal projects and volunteering your time — time that you would not have if you have a full time job. A UBI makes this process much easier.
1.11.13.4.5.2. Pro: There is an increased interest in a candidate's portfolio in platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), complementing the background and path displayed on their CV.
1.11.13.4.5.3. Con: An outdated education is better than none at all.
1.11.13.4.6. Con: If and when a General Artificial Intelligence is developed, there will be no job that cannot be replicated by a machine.
1.11.13.4.7. Pro: Past technological advances such as the tractor or cotton gin eliminated many of jobs in agriculture, but did not result in mass unemployment in the long term, and allowed the expansion of other sectors of the economy such as healthcare or entertainment.
1.11.13.5. Pro: A UBI allows workers to maintain dignity and pay bills while training for new skills higher in demand in the market dynamically, rather than playing the "skills-based education" lottery.
1.11.14. Con: Allowing advancements in automation and artificial intelligence to substitute for human-generated productivity puts your nation at a disadvantage compared to nations who implement both.
1.11.15. Con: A UBI would be an effective solution to disruptions of labor by mechanization replacing human workers. But it does not offset that future hoped for condition here in the present.
1.11.16. Con: As old jobs are destroyed, new jobs have always been created to take their place. A UBI is not necessary for this.
1.11.16.1. Pro: The [US labour market](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/436621/universal-basic-income-ubi-terrible-idea) has added 80 million net jobs since computers were introduced \(in the 1960s\) and 25 million net jobs since the advent of the Internet \(in the 1990s\).
1.11.16.1.1. Con: Since the current technological changes that are occurring are very much different then what we have seen in the past, we cannot assume the rising of the number of jobs is going to continue as predicted by the past.
1.11.16.1.2. Con: Since the 1960s, the US population has increased by approx 132 million, so the number of jobs per capita has actually decreased. [US population by year](http://www.multpl.com/united-states-population/table)
1.11.16.2. Pro: The US labour market presently employs [around 60% of working age individuals](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/436621/universal-basic-income-ubi-terrible-idea), which is actually slightly higher than the pre-WW2 average.
1.11.16.2.1. Con: -> See 1.11.16.1.1.
1.11.16.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.1.3.1.
1.11.16.4. Con: A properly-implemented UBI acts as an economic stimulus, slowing the loss of jobs and increasing their replacement rates, thus weakening and shortening recessions.
1.11.16.5. Con: It is different this time. When people were outperformed in repetitive manual labor there was repetitive cognitive labor to harbor them \([manufacturing industry to service industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKi8HfcxEk&t=1m23s)\). We are still adapting to having been outperformed in repetitive cognitive tasks while on the verge of being [outperformed in varying / complex cognitive tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU&t=11m10s).
1.11.16.5.1. Con: Technological revolution has been faced with this argument at every era. As with previous times, the conception of current technology is hyperbolic and out of touch with the reality. To quote from Yann Lecun, a leading AI academic, "Despite these astonishing advances, we are a long way from machines that are as intelligent as humans - or even rats".
1.11.16.5.2. Con: Productivity and employment data over recent decades does not support that contemporary technology is having a net negative impact on the number of jobs. In fact, productivity has been completely stagnant or even declining in most OECD countries.
1.11.16.5.3. Pro: The [near](https://www.aarp.org/auto/trends-lifestyle/info-2018/future-driverless-cars-fd.html) [advent](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/22/how-far-along-is-self-driving-car-technology-reall.aspx) of [self-driving vehicles](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/self-driving-car-waymo/) is evidence of this. Once they become mainstream, the entire transportation industry will be shaken, with millions losing their primary employment.
1.11.16.6. Pro: Though many current jobs are being replaced by automation, new job positions open up as time goes on, such as robot design and maintenance.
1.11.16.6.1. Con: The number of design, and maintenance jobs created is unlikely to be anywhere near the number of of jobs made obsolete by robots.
1.11.16.7. Con: Automation and technology is resulting in decreased demand for new labor, particularly for low income jobs. This is a disruption in the economic system that renders previous patterns less relevant as comparisons.
1.11.16.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.1.3.1.2.
1.11.16.8. Con: Innovation or technology does not create jobs or opportunities, it just throws all workers in the ocean and let’s them try to survive, this is historically a fact. The industry that benefits from a technological advance will normally just leave the social problems to be solved by a third party \(normally the government\).
1.11.16.9. Con: This argument is both fallacious and dangerously naive, but even if this were true on a macro scale it completely disregards localised effects, which can be disastrous.
1.11.16.10. Pro: The [absolute number](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/17/technology-created-more-jobs-than-destroyed-140-years-data-census) of jobs is actually increasing because technology opens up a greater scope of possible occupations than before - especially when it comes to the digital sector, where job creation is not as constrained by physical capital inputs.
1.11.16.10.1. Con: While the impact of technology in job creation seems beneficial to developing country regions hosting offshore digital activities, in developed countries it has been viewed as a cause of job losses because of the constant search for skilled and low-cost labour. This is raising fears that all such jobs will move away and that individuals losing jobs in developed countries may require training and new skills for a more competitive environment. [\(Human Development Report, 2015, p. 85\).](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2015_human_development_report_1.pdf)
1.11.16.10.2. Con: While new types of jobs may be created eventually, millions will suffer in the meantime because they can't catch up. We are already seeing this with coal miners as solar overtakes coal, and will see it soon with drivers as self-driving cars become ubiquitous. It is unlikely that [3-4 million displaced drivers](https://www.quora.com/How-many-American-workers-are-drivers-truck-drivers-Uber-taxi-drivers-etc) will suddenly get jobs in tech. That requires education. Luckily, UBI gives a person flexibility in order to pursue that education.
1.12. Con: A UBI enables people to work less or leave the workforce permanently.
1.12.1. Pro: As there is very little incentive to work with a UBI, people would choose not to work.
1.12.1.1. Con: [Choice](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/201404/why-having-the-choice-do-nothing-is-so-important) has been found to be a powerful motivator, as a positive relationship has been found between one's ability to choose not to work and one's commitment to work.
1.12.1.1.1. Con: The illusion of choice can also be harmful when it comes to reinforcing harmful social norms. For example, women may be more likely to 'choose' not to work under a UBI, but this choice may be heavily influenced by social messaging and gender norms.
1.12.1.1.1.1. Con: Approximately [40%](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/business/economy/women-as-family-breadwinner-on-the-rise-study-says.html) of American mothers are the breadwinners in their household. This number increases when non-married couples are taken in consideration. Therefore, it is probable that even with a UBI, the representation of women in the workforce will continue to grow.
1.12.1.1.1.2. Con: With a UBI, women currently dependent on their partner's salary will now have their own money.
1.12.1.1.2. Con: This commitment needs to be evaluated relative to the net loss of workers who choose to opt out. Though the quality of workers may marginally increase, the quantity decreases to a more significant and harmful extent.
1.12.1.1.2.1. Con: [An experiment](https://public.econ.duke.edu/~erw/197/forget-cea%20\(2\).pdf) with a UBI resulted in households reducing their workloads by about 13%. This shows that while a UBI slightly decreases the amount individuals work, it does not disincentivize them from working all together.
1.12.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The main reason fewer hours were worked was that male students stayed in school longer – they no longer had to help support their family – and mothers stayed at home longer with newborns. These were both responses that benefited society and ultimately the GDP.
1.12.1.1.2.1.2. Con: The experiment in question only ran for four years, and was known by participants to have a fixed term. The need for future employment is likely a major skewing factor compared to a permanent UBI program.
1.12.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: The experiment ran short term, which could have skewed the results: the rise in unemployment may have been temporary. Learning different skill sets, switching careers, starting a business, or even de-stressing \(so they can pursue a career without mental or physical health problems\) takes time. It's possible that a portion of the 13% did just that.
1.12.1.1.2.1.4. Con: A 13% reduction in work is likely to still have a significant impact on GDP and hence government funds. Taxes represent on average ~15% or less of GDP [data.worldbank.org](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/gc.tax.totl.gd.zs)
1.12.1.2. Pro: As fewer people work, economic growth and prosperity decline. This has massive adverse consequences for society as a whole.
1.12.1.2.1. Con: A UBI reduces the inherent competitiveness of capitalism, which contributes to economic growth.
1.12.1.2.1.1. Con: Cooperation has its benefits as well, and reduced competition leads to closer bonds and easier cooperation between people.
1.12.1.2.2. Pro: People leaving the workforce results in lower production, higher costs, higher inflation, unless the job has already been fully automated.
1.12.1.2.3. Pro: As people leave the work force, tax revenue will decline, making a UBI unsustainable to fund in the long-term.
1.12.1.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.7.2.
1.12.1.3. Con: -> See 1.12.1.1.2.1.
1.12.1.4. Con: Germany has a very sophisticated [social state](https://www.internations.org/germany-expats/guide/15984-social-security-taxation/social-security-in-germany-15970), with a variety of public payments and benefits that enable citizens to live at least a humble life without work. Nevertheless, the [unemployment rate](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/unemployment-rate) is very low.
1.12.1.5. Con: A UBI does not undermine work; it just provides payment sufficient for subsistence. Surplus and extras would derive from work, which will still be the axle of economy.
1.12.1.5.1. Pro: There are lots of ways to structure a UBI. In most of the ways it is proposed, there is still a plenty of incentive to work. Whether it's owning property or buying a car, you're not going to get all that with only a UBI payment.
1.12.1.5.2. Pro: The incentive to work is not to survive, but to obtain wealth. People don't want to be poor.
1.12.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.1.2.
1.12.1.6. Con: In 2011 Iran established a [program](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income) that guaranteed citizens cash payments of equivalent to third of the nation's median income. A report found no evidence for the hypothesis this unconditional income reduced the willingness to work.
1.12.1.6.1. Pro: People engaged in the Iranian [service industry](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income) worked more than before the implementation of the payment program.
1.12.1.6.2. Pro: Iranian business people started to expand their [businesses](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income).
1.12.1.6.3. Pro: There is [evidence](https://theoutline.com/post/1613/iran-introduces-basic-income) that citizens started to pursue more satisfying kind of work instead of leaving the labor market for good.
1.12.1.7. Pro: The free market naturally pays people for being productive. People may opt to do work that does not benefit the economy in any way and use their time for other pursuits.
1.12.1.7.1. Con: It is hard to see why people should be forced to work with absolutely no qualifiers.
1.12.1.7.2. Con: Under our current system, some people commit crimes. The general consensus is that crime — although it is work that enriches the individual — is not to the benefit of the economy. Yet still, the free market encourages it.
1.12.1.7.3. Con: In an increasingly global economy, there is very little work that can objectively be deemed 'non-beneficial to the economy.' The online entertainment, gaming, and creative market through Platforms such as patreon, youtube, and twitch allow individuals to contribute to the economy and get paid by playing video games, creating art and music, or simply being likeable on camera.
1.12.1.8. Con: Income inequality is a stronger incentive to not work.
1.12.1.9. Con: People work for reasons other than income.
1.12.1.9.1. Pro: Labor is often very meaningful to a lot of people, since it provides some sense of dignity.
1.12.1.9.1.1. Con: There are other ways people experience dignity. Being respected and acknowledged for social, familial, and political contributions also provides dignity and meaning to a person's life.
1.12.1.9.1.1.1. Pro: Contributions in the form of personal development and financially aiding the family are among the greatest of these ways.
1.12.1.9.1.2. Pro: Solely living on the UBI could make people feel useless.
1.12.1.9.1.2.1. Con: Nothing is stopping people who want to work from working.
1.12.1.9.1.2.2. Con: Or it could give them the freedom to do things they actually want to do, that would feel meaningful to them.
1.12.1.9.1.2.3. Pro: UBI will increase depression and suicide rates as people lose purpose derived from work.
1.12.1.9.1.2.3.1. Con: Many suicides are correlated with poverty, harsh living circumstances, and generally seeing no way out of a situation. Work stress and hatred of one's job is also a factor in some suicides. The "lifeline", lenience, and hope provided by UBI would likely prevent more suicides than it'd cause.
1.12.1.9.1.3. Con: Current societal and cultural shaming for "not contributing" \(despite there being no universally recognized higher cause to which someone should be contributing\) is what is depriving people of dignity in the first place, which they then attempt to regain by working.
1.12.1.9.1.4. Con: This does not represent everybody and is not an excuse to force labour onto those who would rather not engage in it, unless there is a genuine need for that labour.
1.12.1.9.2. Con: A UBI allows people to work for these reasons unrelated to income at more genuine and efficient levels by reducing financial stress and coercive incentives.
1.12.1.9.3. Con: Then their work could become an activity they choose to engage in, and UBI provides more choices and freedom of choice overall - including that one.
1.12.1.10. Con: The progress of society supports the supposition that people are happy to do more work than the bare minimum needed to survive, in order to improve their lot and save for the future. The provision of a basic income that guarantees survival is unlikely to eliminate that basic drive. Provided a job pays anough to make it worth someone's while to do it, it will find staff. Indeed, a guaranteed basic may well free people to work for the satisfaction of a job well done, without need for cash reward.
1.12.1.11. Con: People would want to work even if they do have a UBI, because they want more than just a sustenance living.
1.12.1.11.1. Pro: People want to improve their social status.
1.12.1.11.1.1. Con: There are other ways to improve social status, such as through [education](https://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/social-mobility-and-education), [marriage](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol26/8/26-8.pdf) or friendship.
1.12.1.11.1.2. Pro: Improving social status will allow people to enjoy the kind of lifestyle they envision for themselves, thus, improving their happiness.
1.12.1.11.2. Pro: The [protestant work ethic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1501011/) is a strong element of many western societies that causes moral pressure to work and it's still a dominant spirit of our era. \([Castells, Himanen, p. 19](https://archive.org/details/TheHackerEthicAndTheSpiritOfTheInformationAge)\).
1.12.1.11.2.1. Pro: For Protestants, the ['psychic harm'](https://hbr.org/daily-stat/2013/08/there-really-is-such-a-thing-a.html) from unemployment is 40% more than for other social groups, due to hard work being viewed as a 'calling' rather than a job.
1.12.1.11.3. Pro: For many people work is an important source of [personal identity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1501011/) and hence self-esteem.
1.12.1.11.3.1. Pro: [Fifty-five percent](http://www.gallup.com/poll/175400/workers-sense-identity-job.aspx) of US workers get their sense of identity from their job.
1.12.1.11.3.2. Con: [Work](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-robinson/self-identity_b_1128731.html) as a major source of personal identity can be detrimental to a person's sense of self-worth, as it is tied to a dynamic external construct and daily performance instead of internal values and attributes. Even if people leave the workforce, it will - under this premise - lead to a more positive and sustainable sense of self-identity.
1.12.1.11.4. Con: Societies and its values are subjects of constant change and progress. Triggered by the UBI, working less or even not working at all could become the social norm and the source for individuals' identity and self-esteem becomes a different one.
1.12.1.11.4.1. Con: Just as societal change can alter the working habits toward working less, they can also form around working more efficiently or productively.
1.12.1.11.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.9.1.1.1.
1.12.1.11.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.12.1.5.2.
1.12.1.11.4.2. Con: Whilst being productive is important, a move away from financial status as the primary source of one's pride should actually be a favourable development for societies.
1.12.1.11.5. Pro: Some people work because they are driven by a personal mission.
1.12.1.11.5.1. Pro: A UBI could restore pride in kinds of work that are culturally significant, but otherwise are not usually fiscally responsible undertakings.
1.12.1.11.5.2. Pro: Some famous and successful [CEOs](https://www.fastcompany.com/3026791/dialed/personal-mission-statements-of-5-famous-ceos-and-why-you-should-write-one-too) have a clear personal mission.
1.12.1.11.6. Pro: In many cultures, especially in East Asia \(e.g. [South Korea](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/23/asia/south-korea-work-culture/)\), there is huge societal pressure to work.
1.12.1.11.6.1. Pro: The societal pressure to work in South Korea is deeply rooted, as it begins in the [classroom](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/04/15/393939759/the-all-work-no-play-culture-of-south-korean-education).
1.12.1.11.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.12.3.1.
1.12.1.11.8. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.9.1.
1.12.1.11.9. Con: If UBI were financed with taxation, the gains of work would mostly go towards financing UBI, and not towards improving the life of the worker.
1.12.1.11.9.1. Con: This implies taxation would be over 50%, which may not be true.
1.12.1.11.9.1.1. Con: Correct. The amount of taxation might be lower \(such as 0%\). But then UBI will be lower as well \(such as 0% of GDP\).
1.12.1.11.9.2. Con: Taxation doesn't have to be that straightforward. E.g. in Denmark, there are elaborate taxation schemes for each level of income. If you're lvl2, only what you earn upwards of lvl1 is taxed more. In the highest income tax bracket, [the tax can be \>50%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Denmark). People still work in those jobs.
1.12.2. Con: Most pilot programs allot enough money for basics, or act as a supplementary buffer to a salary. Not many working-age people would be content living off a UBI alone for an extended period of time.
1.12.2.1. Con: If most working-age people are able to work and would not be content living off of UBI payments that is irrelevant; a UBI is targeted at those who are not.
1.12.2.1.1. Con: UBI is targeted at everyone. It works as a financial safety net that allows people to take risks such as leaving their job to start business.
1.12.3. Pro: Most people go to work today merely because they won't be able to feed themselves or their family otherwise. A UBI will remove that obligation.
1.12.3.1. Con: Existing welfare systems would already allow people to not work but also feed their families \(at least as much as a UBI would\).
1.12.3.2. Con: This statement appears to be saying that the threat of starvation is a useful spur to the workforce. This sort of enforced serfdom belongs in the previous century; an enlightened society does not seek to keep its members impoverished and subjugated. UBI will help to end this sort of thinking and release people from servitude.
1.12.3.2.1. Pro: The right to life is broadly recognized among developed countries.
1.12.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.4.
1.12.3.4. Pro: In wealthy countries people who work only for survival would just stop working. The ones that have passion, work capacity and potential are usually successful. What must be discuss is how to decrease the difference of income between high level positions and the others.
1.12.4. Pro: It is in the best interest for society to heavily incentivize all people to participate in the workforce.
1.12.4.1. Pro: Increased labor participation is [important for economic development.](http://www.worldwatch.org/increase-labor-force-can-be-engine-development-0)
1.12.4.2. Con: In times of increasing automation, 3D printing, and intelligent software, this assumption is outdated.
1.12.4.2.1. Con: Automation won't change the nature of employment: the amount of employment is a feature of a society trading free time for productive wealth.
1.12.4.2.1.1. Con: If a person has a mountain of gold, but can never spend it, they are not wealthy. Similarly, if a society is to busy earning money and capital to enjoy the benefits of it, there is no point to their actions.
1.12.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Furthermore, depending on what form this capital takes and what actions are taken to increase it, their actions may in fact be actively harmful and destructive, either to other humans or to animals, land, and the environment.
1.12.4.2.1.2. Pro: High employment rates and long working hours in a highly-automated society is possible and will produce more wealth than with low employment rates.
1.12.4.2.1.2.1. Con: Total productivity of a working week [goes down](https://www.inzpire.com/2017/01/want-excuse-work-fewer-hours/) once someone starts working above 47 hours/week.
1.12.4.2.2. Pro: As our society becomes more and more automated and a society that will function with less human workers becomes possible, it may be time to reexamine our assumptions about what actually makes a society "wealthy".
1.12.4.2.3. Con: Those technologies are amazing, but we are [very far from a world without need for human labor](http://secondmachineage.com/). There are many problems that can only be addressed by humans in healthcare, childcare, eldercare, cleaning the environment, etc. Someday, we probably will not need human labor, but we do today and will for at least several decades.
1.12.4.3. Con: Societal wealth is a matter of total working hour productivity. More working-hours means more produced, and more material wealth. It is a function of society to decide how much work \(and thus wealth\) for which it is worth sacrificing free time for.
1.12.4.3.1. Con: Social wealth is not a matter of total working hours as claimed. Labour productivity depends much more on the amount of capital present in a country than on total working hours, as shown by the difference in productivity between the US and a country like India. If a UBI removes the incentive to build capital or to maintain existing capital, it will decrease social wealth, regardless of total hours worked.
1.12.4.3.1.1. Con: Given an amount of "capital"—or, more correctly, a given level of technical progress—the amount of labor exercised correlates linearly to the wealth produced until the limits of technology to scale are reached. New technology raises the carry capacity by allowing further scaling, and reduces the invested labor per unit of productive output.
1.12.4.3.1.2. Con: "Capital" is just an abstraction of labor—labor is invested to produce and maintain capital—and generally describes technology, either knowledge of processes \("human capital"\) or tools \(e.g. machines\). It is more-correct to say productivity is determined by technical progress.
1.12.4.3.1.3. Con: Humans economize: they will expend the minimum means to produce the maximum ends. If a UBI were to reduce the total labor, labor would be organized to maximize productivity—to maintain the highest level of technical progress so as to maximize the unit production per labor hour.
1.12.4.3.1.3.1. Con: The fact that society would economize is irrelevant because it does not imply society would be better off. If half of your wealth is destroyed, you economize, exactly because you are worse off than before. But the fact that you economize does not mean it is a good idea to destroy wealth. If UBI removes incentive to build capital or maintain existing capital, you surely economize but you are also worse off.
1.12.4.3.1.3.1.1. Con: The capital you would lose in this scenario would be a waste. Building a factory which cannot be staffed is a use of labor which could otherwise produce actual things and thus wealth; building said factory would be a destruction of wealth. Building or maintaining the capital you claim would go unbuilt or unmaintained would decrease wealth.
1.12.4.3.1.4. Con: This is internally-inconsistent, as it implies that the amount of capital required is fixed and does not grow or shrink with the amount of use to which that capital is put. The is implied by reasoning that an economy cannot scale down to any significant degree, in turn implied by reasoning that less labor means the capital used by that labor goes neglected and decays—rather than that some of the capital becomes excess as production scales down.
1.12.4.3.2. Con: The sentiment is true, but working more \(over employment\) has been known to cause economic crashes. Certain levels of 'productivity' just aren't sustainable due to phenomena [such as the business cycle \(see chapters 9-12\)](http://www.academia.edu/24045849/Macroeconomics_Third_Edition_by_Charles_I._Jones_W.W._Norton_2014).
1.12.4.3.2.1. Pro: Overwork also has health implications, which increases healthcare costs as well as decreasing productivity.
1.12.4.4. Pro: A UBI inflates the baseline reward for not working from $0 to an arbitrarily higher value. For society to function properly, people have to do work that is considered of value by others; an activity that is rewarded through income. But, by providing a baseline income, UBI offsets the incentives that reward value production.
1.12.4.4.1. Con: "Inflating 0 to an arbitrarily higher value" doesn't mean that people won't do work that is considered of value to others. The UBI still exists in a capitalist economy, and there will still be monetary incentive to work.
1.12.4.4.2. Con: A society exists for far greater purposes than providing meaningless work for factory fodder. People who are free from mindless tasks \(that machines can do\) are free to pursue more creative and fulfilling tasks.
1.12.4.4.3. Pro: If work were not valuable to anyone, no one would be willing to pay for it.
1.12.4.4.3.1. Con: People value work that they will not pay for.
1.12.4.4.4. Pro: A janitorial job may not provide huge amounts of value/income, but it still provides some value and thus still contributes to the functioning of society.
1.12.4.4.5. Con: Work valued by others is also an arbitrary judgement. One arbitrary judgement does not disprove another.
1.12.4.4.6. Con: If someone can get by on UBI while they chase their dreams, great things can happen. History is littered with geniuses in their fields who have died young/been forced to abandon their work through poverty.
1.12.4.5. Con: Economic measures are subjective. Contributions to society can only be measured objectively.
1.12.4.6. Con: Participation in the work force has external costs.
1.12.4.7. Con: In ancient times, this was the case, if you didn't have an income, you died.  Fortunately civilisation has moved on, and people are supported when they have a crisis in their lives, UBI is another step on that road.
1.12.4.8. Con: It is in the best interest of society to have a happy and healthy workforce. It is detrimental to society and individuals to have participation in the workforce so heavily incentivized that it leads to mental and physical illness.
1.12.4.9. Pro: Government's priority should always be to encourage employment instead of giving people the hope that they can feed on subsidies. If not the production and innovation process will stagnate.
1.12.4.9.1. Con: This would suggest that there will always be employment. There's no reason to think that all possible work that can be filled by robots \(automation\) won't be. Those wages will be saved by the former employers.
1.12.4.9.2. Pro: UBI removes the incentive to work, adding to the welfare state. We have more job openings now than total number of people seeking employment. In that case, UBI would only inflate the unemployment rate making it more difficult for companies to hire and grow.[money.cnn.com](http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/05/news/economy/job-openings-unemployed-workers/index.html)
1.12.5. Con: Currently, people work out of social and economical obligation. A UBI diminishes this obligation, enhancing people's sense of freedom and agency.
1.12.5.1. Con: People are free to choose not to work in capitalist systems. The fact that there are consequences to that choice doesn't make it economic coercion.
1.12.5.1.1. Con: By logical extension: when pointing a gun to an individual's head and asking them to do something, said individual is free not to do said thing. The fact that there are likely going to be consequences to that choice is exactly what makes it coercive.
1.12.5.2. Con: It is not the job of government to unconditionally support individual's 'freedom' if they are not willing to engage in the economic exchange of labor.
1.12.5.3. Pro: For some people, who are genuinely not fit for the workforce, this is a good thing. These people can now live much more enjoyable lives.
1.12.6. Pro: A UBI is a wealth re-distribution scheme. All wealth re-distribution inherently dis-incentivizes productive work. The wealth to pay for the UBI must come from productive people in the society. These people are net payers into the system. They are getting their wealth confiscated for the benefit of others, which discourages work. Those who are net beneficiaries of the re-distribution would also only work enough \(if at all\) to remain beneficiaries and not become net payers.
1.12.6.1. Con: Current welfare is a form of re-distribution which dis-incentivizes work more than a basic income would because of pay brackets under which there would be a [negligible increase to overall income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_trap#Examples) once starting to work. Under basic income, extra income directly contributes to increase your overall income.
1.12.6.2. Con: Most wealth in developed nations is not held by the majority of productive people, but rather historically wealthy families, corporations, and entities. Few or no individuals could work and earn a living large enough for a UBI to disincentivise hard work and general productivity.
1.12.6.3. Con: A UBI just guarantees sufficient money to pay for basic necessities. In fact, guaranteeing a home and food provides incentive for more productive work as workers will get to choose what they want to do rather than being forced to do what they have to do.
1.12.6.3.1. Pro: UBI doesn't need to provide any motivation - boredom will do that. All a UBI will do is provide enough for food / shelter / healthcare. Anything beyond basic necessities must be worked for.
1.12.6.4. Con: Many people who currently claim benefits but are capable of working do so because they are dis-incentivised to do the only jobs available to them which are highly unpleasant. Having the support structure of UBI allows them to peruse jobs they actually care about — when someone is working at a job they are doing because they want to rather than because they have to, productivity is higher.
1.12.6.4.1. Pro: Wages for unpleasant jobs will also rise, forcing such jobs to be appropriately rewarded to entice people into them rather than people being forced into them as their only real option.
1.12.6.5. Con: On the contrary, it is a payment they make to keep society relatively prosperous and crime free by not pushing people to destitution. As human labour slowly becomes inessential, this would push companies to adopt efficient production technologies by removing the incentive of cheap labour, since people are not forced to work wherever they can just to feed their family.
1.12.7. Con: This argument runs in support of UBI as it supports those who cannot find work. Systematic unemployment due to lack of available jobs is a future threat to human welfare even in the current economy, and that threat is [likely to increase in the future](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/what-is-the-future-of-work/).
1.12.7.1. Con: We should be trying to [create more jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n6ivGgb9RY)!  Not finding ways to get people out of the workforce!
1.12.7.1.1. Pro: Job creation increases economic well-being.  Like it did in the [Reagan era](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylesmith/2014/09/11/sorry-obama-fans-reagan-did-better-on-jobs-and-growth/#549b9fab55e1)!
1.12.7.1.1.1. Con: It is doubtful that all relevant factors are the same as they were in the Reagan era.
1.12.7.1.2. Pro: More jobs means a better economy because more jobs means more people with money.  More people with money means more people buying things which means more profits for companies which means even more jobs!
1.12.7.1.2.1. Con: Given [that over the last few decades real wages have barely budged](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/), this calculus clearly no longer holds. Any growth in jobs and the economy has not lead to increases in consumer spending power; because costs are instead rising in terms of basic expenses such as food and healthcare.
1.12.7.1.3. Con: Creating jobs is nice and even if we 'should' try, it is likely that will be [impossible in the future](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/what-is-the-future-of-work/), at least that 100% employment is impossible.
1.12.7.1.4. Con: This implies \(or avoids saying\) we should avoid UBI in order to drive job creation. Individuals benefit from UBI and corporations create jobs. Supporting individuals when corporations fail to create jobs makes sense. Whether or not corporations should or shouldn't create jobs is irrelevant.
1.12.7.1.5. Con: UBI is not a way of getting people out of the workforce; it is a better way of supporting those who are between jobs, those who are working in jobs that don't suit them, and those who can't find a job they are able to do. UBI could allow them the opportunity to find a better fit for their talents and abilities, or allow them the freedom to learn more in order to do so.
1.12.7.1.6. Con: Why should we be creating more jobs if we can focus on automation? Why force people to labour more when the goal should be to labour less.
1.12.7.2. Pro: The argument strengthens if humanity rejects its current apocalyptic drive for consumption. To the extent unemployment is unavoidable and not a result of personal inadequacy or market down-cycles, then UBI because a necessary protection insurance against the societal costs of widespread crime and poverty.
1.12.7.3. Pro: When employment is working at a task better done my machines and only preserved as human labor for the sake of creating jobs, 100% unemployment should be a goal not something to fear.
1.12.8. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.12.1.
1.12.9. Con: Our level of technology will not suffice to run a complete economy without human intervention. Therefore, we couldn't afford to give a full income to someone without that fully automated economy.
1.12.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.16.1.1.1.
1.12.10. Con: Leaving the workforce allows laborers the time they need to develop other skills so that they can rejoin the workforce later with value added.
1.12.11. Con: As automation and machines eventually displace more and more humans out of the workforce having people work less is actually a positive effect.
1.12.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.12.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.
1.12.11.3. Pro: This will save companies money through lower labor costs. The money saved could be used to fund a UBI.
1.12.12. Pro: The increasing availability of cheap online entertainment has already made labour force participation [increasingly unappealing](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/09/labor-force-participation-video-games.html); a UBI would enable and accelerate this existing trend.
1.12.12.1. Con: This problem is compared with other [scares](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-1980s-media-panic-over-dungeons-dragons) that turned out to not be of consequence.
1.12.13. Con: [A UBI experiment](http://www.developmentpathways.co.uk/resources/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Indias-Basic-Income-Experiment-PP21.pdf) in India showed that this idea is empirically not true. Not only did overall employment increase with implementation of a UBI, but there was also a sharp increase in more independent labor - which specifically helped women. Individual debt also dropped for 73% of people, and increased for none.
1.12.13.1. Con: The experiment did not actually test a UBI, because benefits were temporary, which significantly alters the incentive of beneficiaries towards making something lasting out of it. If they thought this income would become the norm instead of being a financial windfall, they would not be as motivated to reduce debt, for example.
1.12.13.2. Con: The experiment did not actually test a UBI, because the benefits were not paid from taxes collected in the villages, but injected from outside. Instead of UBI, which is a zero-sum game within the economic zone in which it is implemented, they brought in purchasing power from outside the "UBI" zone, which of course makes the villages better off.
1.12.13.2.1. Con: While this experiment may not be an accurate representation of the macroeconomic consequences, it still shows the effects of a UBI on individual behavior: increased school attendance, reduced debts, and a shift in occupations from wage laborer to farmer.
1.12.13.2.2. Con: Even if purchasing power is redistributed rather than raised \(on net\) a zero-sum change can still improve net welfare as the benefit of the marginal dollar to the poor is much higher than the to rich.
1.12.13.2.2.1. Pro: Also in any small scale view, this is not a sum zero game. A poor area \(such as this village\) will net benefit, and a rich area \(which could have been a wealthy town nearby\) will net loose.
1.12.13.3. Con: The experiment did not actually test a UBI as it is usually proposed, because the benefits were designed to be just enough to make a difference, but not enough to live off. It was a supplemental income that still required the villagers to work for their livelihood, as opposed to an income that can buy at least food, clothing and shelter.
1.12.14. Con: -> See 1.12.1.11.
1.12.15. Con: This is not unambiguously bad, as many if not most people do not enjoy being obligated to work, so if work was made more voluntary and incentivized in other ways \(e.g. wages above and beyond one's UBI, contribution to causes one agrees with, jobs which are enjoyable to the worker\) this would arguably be an improvement to society and societal quality of life.
1.12.16. Con: This could be positive if it cuts bureaucracy and unecessary jobs that are only there to allow people to make a living.
1.12.17. Pro: Those who have [multiple citizenship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_citizenship), could receive an UBI in a wealthy nation, then spend it in a poor country with a cheap cost of life. That would be a leak of money and workforce, from the rich country to the poor one.
1.12.17.1. Pro: Somehow people already use this kind of construct when they retire abroad: they have worked all their life in a wealthy country, then they get a small pension compare to the cost of living in this country. But they chose to go to live in countries with a cheap cost of life and there they can have luxury with that same pension.
1.12.17.2. Pro: People already do that through normal activities \(jobs, traveling, purchasing stocks\), company actions \(like outsourcing and storing profits overseas\), or crime.
1.12.17.3. Con: There could be incentives to prevent that from happening, like to get a UBI, the person must not be out of the country for more than 1 month of the year \(except for vacations longer than that\). If they are, the UBI stops for them.
1.12.17.4. Con: [In 2017, the average US outbound traveler](https://travel.trade.gov/outreachpages/download_data_table/2017%20Profile%20of%20US%20Residents%20Visiting%20Overseas.xlsx) spent $1,476 outside of the US as part of a trip for business or pleasure \(cell C402\). The average length of stay abroad was over 16 days \(cell C206\). The average household income of international travelers was $127k \(cell C477\). I do not believe those that can afford to travel internationally would receive a significant portion of their income as UBI, nor that it would impact our economy any more significantly than outbound tourism already does.
1.12.18. Pro: This will lead to ex-workers losing their skills - essentially becoming vegetables.
1.12.18.1. Con: People will take up new hobbies and interests, many of which will be or will have the potential to become productive.
1.12.19. Con: People only collecting UBI would be on the bottom of society with a all the time they want and need to ascend higher and benefit the world in any way they want.
1.12.20. Con: A UBI will enable unhappy workers who detract from work productivity to leave their jobs, so happy/productive workers can take their place.
1.12.20.1. Con: This assumes there are a surplus of happy workers to take necessary jobs.
1.12.20.1.1. Con: There is an excess of all workers at the moment, and while it is possible none of them will be more agreeable with the working conditions, it is probable a good number will be.
1.12.20.2. Con: This assumes happy workers are more productive, which is [false](http://www.hiringsmart.com/articles/608/Happy_Employees_are_not_Necessarily_Productive_Employees/).
1.12.20.2.1. Con: The linked article states that disengaged workers are not productive - so enabling disengaged workers to leave a job they are not engaged with and find a job or other activities which are more engaging and satisfying to them would produce a similar benefit.
1.12.20.3. Pro: Happy workers are [more productive](http://fortune.com/2015/10/29/happy-productivity-work/).
1.12.20.3.1. Con: Workers are not happy if their work is not valued more highly than "non-work"; Ubi devalues basic work.
1.12.21. Con: This would be highly beneficial for those with moderately severe chronic illness or disability or those who otherwise cannot qualify for disability assistance programs
1.13. Con: UBIs could be used by political elites to avoid addressing structural injustices.
1.13.1. Pro: Because it is universally accessible, a UBI does nothing to address specific sociocultural issues of minorities. If anything the 'equality' it provides erases differences and unfairly redirects blame for poverty back onto minorities.
1.13.1.1. Con: Many socio-cultural issues exist because of the economic disadvantaged state of minorities. A UBI alleviates this economic discrepancy.
1.13.1.2. Pro: Poverty is an endemic issue for minority groups; but one whose root cause is systemic discrimination in the past and present. These underlying issues are overlooked, meaning a UBI is easily characterised as a 'universal handout' that will fix the issues of poverty in minority communities.
1.13.1.2.1. Con: Just because it will fix the poverty of everyone doesn't mean that it won't also fix poverty in minority groups.
1.13.1.2.2. Con: Poverty, whatever the cause, is primarily a financial condition. Any measure that eases that condition does so regardless of social divisions and other disadvantages. Systemic bigotry against minorities that may hinder further advancement of members of a given group is a separate issue that requires unrelated counter measures.
1.13.1.2.2.1. Con: Dealing with the symptoms of an ailment often helps expedite recovery.
1.13.1.3. Con: Because if people take the free living wage provided by the government and squander it on something unnecessary, it really is their fault if they are out of their living wage.
1.13.1.3.1. Con: UBI will actually help fix the spending habits of the poor. Studies show that bad spending habits[come from a mindset of the scarcity of now](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/03/science/la-sci-poor-people-decisions-20121103), and when people are given enough resources to think about the future those habits disappear.
1.13.1.3.1.1. Pro: The fact is, most poor people [do not spend](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083428) in the way we assume and peer reviewed studies say that policies that contain food price inflation, improve decent-paying job opportunities for the urban poor are likely to reduce the use of negative coping strategies.
1.13.1.4. Con: A nation's choice of redistribution schemes is not the only tool by which to address specific differences in equality and so UBIs should not be dismissed as a means to provide economic relief to all individuals.
1.13.1.5. Con: The fact that while working to alleviate a particular immediate problem, a UBI doesn't fix every other issue is not an argument against a UBI.
1.13.1.6. Con: A law that ameliorates a symptom instead of a root cause can still have value. For example, distributing food or money to combat hunger does nothing to aleviate the root causes of hunger, but still adds tremendous value to humanity.
1.13.1.6.1. Pro: Many diseases are treated with "supportive care" to make things easier for the body in other ways, allowing it to focus its "efforts" and energy on the primary illness.
1.13.1.7. Con: UBI is not the solution to discrimination. UBI is the solution to automation. Discrimination must be fixed separately. If discrimination were fixed, we would still need UBI. Therefore, misuse of UBI for the sake of discrimination is not a reason to oppose UBI.
1.13.2. Pro: Passing a UBI may mean that welfare and poverty will be seen as a 'solved' issue, which requires no further help from the State.
1.13.2.1. Con: This is an argument against literally any attempt to fight poverty. This risk does not outweigh the policy's tangible benefits for the poor.
1.13.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.11.2.2.
1.13.2.3. Con: If society believes that welfare and poverty is a "solved" issue, then it is a fault of the society, not the UBI.
1.13.2.3.1. Pro: UBI can help improve faulty perceptions and beliefs around poverty.
1.13.2.4. Con: Just because an UBI exists, does not mean that people are not in poverty. This will be seen in studies performed by the government and third party organizations.
1.13.2.5. Pro: A bigger issue concerning inequality relates to distribution of wealth. There is a danger that UBI will act as a distraction, and disguise the bigger issue. This is especially the case in an era of accelerating technology, when profits to GDP have been hovering around an all-time high and we seem to be seeing a winner takes all society evolve, with the creation of natural monopolies in technology verticals, such as search, social media, room bookings, car sharing, etc.
1.13.2.6. Pro: UBI is the [New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal) of the future. In that it will appease the masses for a little bit, but then become slowly unraveled until it's meaningless. Especially since the plutocrat donors have such obscene political power.
1.13.2.7. Pro: Equality of opportunity, which can be achieved through affirmative action policies, is unlikely to be popular when huge portions of the budget are already being spent on a UBI.
1.13.2.7.1. Con: Affirmative action policies rarely cost money to implement. It is unclear why the cost of a UBI would influence whether they are implemented.
1.13.2.7.2. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.
1.13.2.7.3. Con: Giving people a basic income would go a long way towards increasing equality of opportunity as poverty is one of the biggest factors in inequality of opportunity.
1.13.3. Pro: A UBI replacing the myriad number of welfare programs means that welfare as a political issue only has a single dimension: at what rate should the UBI be set. This can distract from other policy options that could more strategically target injustice and welfare needs.
1.13.3.1. Con: It is possible for a UBI to co-exist with a bare minimum degree of social welfare programs. These welfare programs could address other injustices.
1.13.3.2. Con: When people are free from concerns about their own destitution they will be empowered to mobilize around the plights of their fellow citizens. A UBI makes sincere prioritization of other's needs possible in a way that is currently impossible for most citizens.
1.13.3.3. Con: "Strategic" often translates to more complex, and complexity is more difficult to fight through democratic means. A UBI would simplify political discussion to a level that can be impacted by votes.
1.13.3.4. Pro: UBIs are arbitrary numbers, and once in effect, the only productive value one must provide to society is your vote, which is likely just to be for a larger UBI.
1.13.3.4.1. Con: Many activities provide value to society even if they are not remunerated activities.
1.13.3.5. Pro: UBI's will make a whole group of dependent people dependent forever on the one political party that makes UBI's law. The more people that become dependent on UBI's the stronger the one political party will become.
1.13.3.6. Pro: If a country were to hit a rough patch economically, putting UBI on a hold would throw those dependant on it back into poverty. UBI addresses the symptoms, not the problem.
1.13.3.7. Pro: A UBI is easier to quantify. Is the UBI set at the correct amount is an easier question to get meaningful political responses on than “should the poor get more?”
1.13.3.8. Pro: UBI is unsustainable in a democracy because over time because organized voting blocs will lobby and vote for increasingly larger payments out of the public treasury. Enough politicians will be incentivized to dispense them in exchange for consolidating their political power.
1.13.3.9. Pro: Ultimately the level of UBI would become distorted by politicians looking to curry favor from the population receiving them. Such biased inputs would ultimately lead to unsustainable redistribution. Who would turn down an ever increasing level of UBI?
1.13.3.10. Pro: Once the welfare system is focused into one monetary sum, it will become a political target subject to erosion at each election. Over time, politicians will drive the payments down to win votes, leading to increased poverty. The poor today have multiple options to address income, housing and healthcare. Rolling those into one payment subject to political whim is a high risk strategy for the poor.
1.13.3.10.1. Con: The poor are already under this kind of attack. A UBI might actually mitigate this as it would reduce desire for "incentive" and "work requirement" schemes. It would be simpler to implement as well.
1.13.3.10.2. Con: With it all being in one sum, it would be harder for politicians to skim some money off the top as they do now. Ie. Take 2% off of $20 in 5 different values and nobody will notice, but take 2% off of $100 once and it becomes more pronounced.
1.13.4. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.
1.13.5. Con: A universal policy like a UBI is unlikely to reduce the political will of marginalised groups as they will be just as \(relatively\) disadvantaged after the UBI. Thus political will for them to lobby to improve their position is un-diminshed, and elites will feel equally pressured.
1.13.5.1. Pro: When more people are free from concerns about their own destitution, they will be empowered to mobilize around the plights of their fellow citizens. UBI makes sincere prioritization of other's needs possible in a way that is currently impossible for most citizens.
1.13.5.2. Con: That assumes that people are motivated by altruism. If one takes the view that people are inherently selfish, providing for their basic needs may lead many toward a more apathetic view as it relates to politics, leaving them even more marginalized than they were before, when participation was necessary due to their circumstances.
1.13.6. Pro: It is difficult to create political sympathy for the poor when they are already by far one of the largest spending items on a government budget \([e.g US War on Poverty](http://budget.house.gov/waronpoverty/)\). Therefore it is difficult to politically motivate for a structural reform while implementing this policy.
1.13.6.1. Con: The [largest spending item](http://www.businessinsider.com/2012-us-defense-budget-largest-since-world-war-ii-2011-7) on the US budget in 2012 was defense, not spending on the poor, and there was very little to no loss of political support for the US military.
1.13.6.2. Con: A UBI does not just go to the poor. It goes to everyone, including the middle class. Therefore, it should have more support than most welfare programs.
1.13.6.3. Con: The lack of political sympathy assumption is false. By this reasoning, it should be difficult to create political sympathy for the elderly because the vast majority of health care money is spent on them \(and this does not happen\).
1.13.6.3.1. Con: This comparison is flawed. Contrary to poverty, aging is a process almost every member of society will experience. Therefore political sympathy for the elderly is in the self-interest of \(almost\) all citizens.
1.13.7. Pro: The effects of a UBI on local economies and politics can create harmful flow-on effects for other countries.
1.13.7.1. Pro: A UBI in wealthy nations incentivizes further automation of labor, diminishing employment opportunities everywhere.
1.13.7.2. Pro: A UBI could exacerbate global inequality if it incentivises isolationist policies, such as closed borders or an indifference to the conditions of the global labor force.
1.13.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.13.7.2.2. Pro: If a UBI 'solves' many of the problems present in developed economies \(such as insufficient social safety nets or poor working conditions\) this can undermine empathy for — and solidarity with — the conditions of workers in poorer countries.
1.13.7.2.2.1. Con: The argument that doing something about why a country is horrible would make people less sympathetic to the people of that country can be applied to anything that makes that country is horrible.
1.13.7.2.2.2. Con: As it stands, there is very little international sympathy for undeveloped countries to lose.
1.13.8. Con: While possibly true, this is better addressed directly. Suggesting we should not implement UBI due to potential and indirect later harms is to put the cart before the horse.
1.13.8.1. Pro: The UBI itself would be a step towards addressing these imbalances.
1.13.8.2. Con: However we are not living in a hypothetical situation. If UBI were to be implemented, those real-life problems would occur, so they are necessary to discuss. Statements like these are what lead to issues like those that privatised prisons in the US are facing. All effects must be taken into account.
1.13.9. Pro: UBI, like the minimum wage, requires a government\(s\) to draw an arbitrary line for the "ideal" standard of living, that it aims to promote.
1.13.9.1. Con: It is widely acknowledged that there are standards of living humans should not be expected to suffer below. It is simply a matter of determining where this line is, which is not "arbitrary".
1.13.9.1.1. Pro: [Scientific studies](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.short) have shown that 75,000 US dollars is the ideal amount of money for human happiness and prosperity.
1.13.9.2. Con: The ideal standard of living is a global, not a national concept. The UN helps reinforce this with research, and that standard is what a country deploying UBI would use.
1.13.9.3. Con: If a government would decide to give a 'too small' UBI, they wouldn't give it in the first place. The whole point of UBI is to eradicate poverty, and if it doesn't there's no reason to put in place.
1.13.10. Con: A UBI will empower the politically marginalized by freeing them from the shackles of wage slavery. When people are free to think and organize without fear of destitution they will be able to take control of their democracy and enact their political might on structural injustices.
1.13.10.1. Pro: The ability to organize one's workplace without the threat of losing access to basic needs will be a great democratizing force.
1.13.10.2. Con: If the UBI is being provided by the government, organizing against the government would create a fear of destitution.
1.13.10.3. Con: By financing UBI through this system it would gain legitimacy. The structural injustices would be seen as a necessary evil in order to provide for the basic needs of everyone.
1.13.11. Con: An UBI doesn't exclude the righting of structural injustices. It has never been claimed that the purpose of UBI would be to right structural injustices to begin with. So this argument is an irrelevant distraction.
1.13.11.1. Con: It's not irrelevant at all. The thesis of the discussion is whether rich countries should implement UBI. One does not need a claim UBI would right structural injustices in order for someone to say a UBI would entrench structural injustices.
1.13.12. Con: A UBI inherently levels the playing field to remove structural injustices.
1.13.12.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.
1.13.12.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.13.12.3. Pro: People with "invisible", poorly documented or otherwise hard to prove disabilities can receive a UBI without tolerating questioning or having to produce proof.
1.13.12.4. Pro: UBI is a good starting point for establishing much broader systemic economic reform. The establishment of a UBI standard that is matched with a variety of other economic factors would allow our whole society to be enriched by innovation and cultural development. It seems over simplified to suggest that it would stifle self determination; If done with, integrity it may  allow individuals to focus on their true passions and become innovators as well foster a stronger democratic-capitalist system.
1.13.13. Con: Political elites would use any available policy \(UBI or not\) to push their own agendas.
1.13.13.1. Con: Simply because there are other modes available to push agendas doesn't negate the premise that UBIs may provide another such tool and have the potential for additional harm.
1.13.14. Pro: Cultivating dependence on the state through UBI reduces the bargaining power of the governed. Only when the state depends on its population for their labour, and when the people have the ability to withhold it, do the people have any power over the state save for that of violent revolution.
1.13.14.1. Pro: For example, oil-rich rentier states of the middle east grant generous allowances to their subjects, in which demands for rights can be ignored as there is no consequence to the state of doing so.
1.13.14.1.1. Con: It is up to voters to ensure that they do not trade basic comforts for basic rights. If a goverment says 'allow torture or you can't have security' voters can \(and have\) said 'we will not allow torture, you are still being paid to provide and responsible for security'. If they do not then any basic comfort or need can hold them hostage
1.13.14.2. Con: In a democratic society the power lies in the vote. The elected officials would gain power if they could convince their constituents they would support and/or increase the UBI.
1.13.14.2.1. Con: The only power difference between a democracy and a dictatorship is the size of an incumbent's winning coalition. In a democracy, most citizens are not part of the winning coalition. Therefore their vote is not important.
1.13.14.3. Con: Most persons in mainstream western society are dependent on private employers, which could be argued to be worse and less empowering than being dependent on the state.
1.13.14.4. Pro: A UBI will be used to create deeper levels of poverty/dystopia for the former laboring class. This income will not be enough to offer much more than the poverty traps that are already offered by employers today. To maintain control they need a desperate class on the edge of poverty and insecurity.
1.13.14.4.1. Con: Even just reducing the stress of the poorest strata of society will lead to positive shifts in society and their lifestyle.
1.13.14.5. Pro: A UBI would create political inequality, as people would become afraid to bite the hand that feeds them.
1.13.14.6. Pro: Government should be dependent on people for survival, not people dependent on government. Those in power could use UBI as a tool similar to tax brackets are used today, with the difference being that depending on the change, people would be unable to feed themselves.
1.13.14.7. Pro: A UBI breaks the checks-and-balances guaranteed by laws such as those of the US Constitution. The people are the ultimate authority, and by providing unconditional sustenance and billeting allowances at a national scale, citizens no longer have authority over the state; instead the state now has direct authority over the peoples which tips the scales of checks-and-balances.
1.13.14.8. Pro: UBI would become a political tool that like welfare \(US\), is used by politicians as to gain gain/hold power. As with welfare programs, UBI recipients would be hostage of corrupt political people and processes that divide those who receive UBI from those who pay the taxes to provide UBI. This is not to mention the sad human state of dependence on government that UBI creates.
1.13.14.9. Con: People currently depend on the state for physical security \(police, military\), environmental protection \(clean water\), power, etc. The state cannot withhold universal protections to assert power, they can only withhold limited exceptions.
1.13.14.10. Pro: UBI sounds good, but someone or a small group will have to administer the program determining the benefits, collection of resources and distribution.  This puts a lot of power into a small group.  Potentially political power. History tells us political power in the hands of a small group has not always ended well.
1.13.15. Pro: A UBI together with automation will strengthen the position of high tax payers, by making the state dependent on their taxes \(to pay for UBI\).
1.13.15.1. Con: Those high tax payers already control the state in the US, and elsewhere. This is a general problem of money in politics, not of welfare policies, UBI or otherwise.
1.13.15.1.1. Pro: The wealthiest actually pay less tax than anyone else, as a percentage of income, currently, allowing them more to spend influencing politics.
1.13.15.2. Con: -> See 1.7.15.6.
1.13.15.3. Pro: Assuming a UBI is financed through high marginal tax rates, this would make democracies \(e.g. US/UK\) even more extraordinarily protective of their most profitable industries, some of which may be globally exploitative, such as investment banking and resource extraction.
1.13.15.4. Con: A UBI does not necessarily have to be funded through taxes, or can be funded through taxes which are not dependent on an individual's income.
1.13.15.5. Pro: Historically and currently, in any government the more a population pays more in taxes, the more it is likely to be listened to by representatives or the state. Those on a UBI are not taxed, and will be beholden to the increasing control of those who will be taxed and who pay for the UBI. Systemically this will concentrate into fewer hands over time, becoming serfdom.
1.13.16. Con: This could also be true of any program that promotes social equality. However, such programs in general weaken the influence of elites by empowering the disadvantaged.
1.13.16.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.
1.13.16.2. Pro: A UBI allows would-be political activists more time to engage in such activities without feeling as much financial pressure to engage in paid work instead.
1.13.17. Pro: We evolve as civilization by taming basic instincts; however we have yet to subdue the thirst for power and selfishness, which will inevitably lead any form of system to corruption.
1.13.17.1. Pro: A precursor towards a brighter future of the kind that universal welfare systems like a UBI promote is to begin taming our instincts so that a less selfish stance on each individual is rewarded, and thirst for power is tamed so it does not corrupt.
1.13.18. Con: The possibility that a system could be misused by malicious actors does not constitute evidence that the system would not be beneficial if used in good faith. If the system implemented faithfully would provide benefit, then the question of how to prevent abuse is a secondary \(if still important\) issue.
1.13.18.1. Con: Plenty of government policies if "implemented faithfully", would be beneficial, but it must be acknowledged that they aren't. A prime example includes regulatory capture, but in theory even a dictatorship, if benevolent, would likely be beneficial yet we recognize we should not support such a kind of government.
1.13.18.1.1. Con: It is possible to assess the consequences by performing experiments at a small scale. The fear itself of it failing cannot work as a deterrent, it is necessary to assess whether those fears are real or imagined. In the example of a dictatorship, it has been tried before over and over, however, most of the time it is not beneficial. It is not possible to say the same about an UBI unless experiments are completed.
1.13.18.1.1.1. Con: While it may be a good idea to test UBIs \(or not; it may not be practical to "test" UBIs on a "small scale"\), no examples of concluded, positive tests have been offered. Simply put, we cannot yet use the "possibility" of tests as support for the thesis.
1.13.18.2. Pro: Corruption is an evil in our society and is not affected by the economic policies.
1.13.18.2.1. Con: That doesn't mean that economic policies aren't affected, or even directed by such corruption, to better benefit certain groups or individuals.
1.13.19. Con: Democratic franchise is a check on all abuses of power.
1.13.20. Pro: State provision crowds out the ability for more dynamic institutions to develop. This reliance on continued redistribution makes the poor vulnerable to shifts in political sentiment and policy.
1.13.20.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.1.
1.13.20.2. Con: These more "dynamic" institutions have been woefully inadequate in dealing with structural poverty.
1.13.20.3. Con: A simplified system makes changes to legislation more transparent and easier to compare. The poor can vote with more confidence and keep representatives in place that meet their needs.
1.13.21. Pro: A plausible side effect of this is that a UBI could help create the conditions for widespread societal instability.
1.13.21.1. Pro: A UBI will foster social unrest. As people won't have to work they will start loitering and ultimately rioting. The \(economically passive\) population's only interest in civil society will be to demand continuous increases of the UBI.
1.13.21.1.1. Con: Nearly [40%](https://qz.com/516023/if-nearly-40-of-americans-arent-working-what-are-they-doing/) of Americans are not working but research shows their time is not spent loitering but rather on other activities such as education.
1.13.21.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.2.1.
1.13.21.2. Pro: UBI will lead to alienation, which will ultimately lead to the destruction of civilization. When the population doesn't actively participate in the economy anymore, they will disengage and lose their mental and moral markers.
1.13.21.2.1. Con: Experiments so far have not shown that UBI leads to alienation; people still participate in the economy. The majority still want to make extra money unless they are educating themselves or caring for other family members \(children, ill or disabled relatives, etc\).
1.13.21.2.2. Con: Participating in the economy is not linked to mental or moral markers.
1.13.21.3. Pro: A UBI will lead to even greater wealth disparities between countries, increasing instability and injustice.
1.13.21.3.1. Con: A UBI does not change the general wealth of a country by default, it just distributes it differently. Therefore it is no reason for instability between counties, but it could be an example that leads to a more just and peacefully social structure in neighbouring countries.
1.13.21.4. Pro: A UBI is a lot like the "[Bread and Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses)" politics of Ancient Rome under the emperors. These politics accompanied the demise of democracy in Rome.
1.13.21.4.1. Con: Rome's society was stable: the Ancient Rome existed for [723 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome) \(the Eastern part even for [1700 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire)\), and was highly successful. Bread and Entertainment is therefore an effective practice of appeasement.
1.13.21.5. Pro: The people who would fund a UBI would be the ones who would need it to automate industry without creating social unrest and may not be reliable to guarantee the service in the long term.
1.13.21.6. Pro: Universal welfare will encourage more people to drop out of the workforce, which makes society much more fragile, as it means that a bankruptcy of the government will lead to many millions dying from privation, as happened when the USSR collapsed.
1.13.21.7. Pro: UBI would lead to class conflict between net payees and net recievers. The class of net receivers would enlarge till they destroy capitalism and cause collapse of economy.
1.13.21.8. Pro: Society is a group of individuals who cooperate for a common purpose, at least for survival. Not guaranteeing a job or an income means excluding some less fortunate \(or even problematic\) individuals from society. This generates new enemies of society and does not benefit anyone. Finally, ensuring a job is more expensive, ensuring the UBI is less expensive.
1.13.22. Pro: A UBI does not resolve humanity's dependence on an \(almost always\) capitalist economy to take care of our needs.
1.13.22.1. Pro: -> See discussion #8823: A monetary economy should not exist if automation takes over everyone's job.
1.13.22.2. Pro: A UBI just enables the continuation of our current economic system that requires continual production and consumption for its own sake; which we can already see is destroying our environment. Money has humanity competing with each other, sometimes to the death. We cannot allow an inanimate object \(money\) to create our reality. We need to design a better system that encourages co-operation and cares for us all and the home we share.
1.13.22.3. Pro: There is already an inherent hierarchy and wealth imbalance. In order to first create UBI the classicism that has been ingrained in us from childhood must be removed.Another flaw is limiting wealth among those without creating a Marxist government.
1.13.22.4. Pro: Focus on the monetary coverage of basic needs without a clear statement that these are the basic human rights \(housing, food, healthcare, education, electricity etc.\) allows to keep the system of control by the size of UBI determined by the elites. The whole idea behind UBI is to liberate people, not to change their chains.
1.13.23. Pro: If politicians tackle the root causes of people needing the UBI, such as a failing infrastructure that people rely on for jobs, then a UBI would not be brought up.
1.13.23.1. Pro: A UBI does not solve any systemic problems* \(only eases their effects\) and creates issues of its own. Instead we should invest in concepts that truly resolve issues without causing further damage. 
*Systemic problems could be anything from, but limited to, financial \(such needing a job to survive\), educational \(decision-making skills\), political \(infrastructure\), and environmental \(resource use from more spending\).
1.13.24. Pro: A UBI can be used to placate the general populace in order to lessen opposition to the government or calls for more fundamental reforms.
1.13.24.1. Pro: The [Saudi Arabian](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2016/10/03/saudi-government-budget-cuts-prove-basic-income-is-no-solution-to-slow-economic-growth/#1376eff54bbe) government provides its citizens with a form of UBI in order to keep them happy and thus cement government power and the prevailing societal conditions.
1.13.24.1.1. Con: The Saudi system is not a UBI but rather large-scale public employment and spending that systematically excludes women and religious minorities.
1.13.24.1.1.1. Con: The difference between a UBI and such an employment program is negligible.
1.13.24.1.1.1.1. Con: The difference is not negligible if you are a woman or religious minority; it is the difference between receiving a healthy living wage and between receiving nothing.
1.13.24.1.1.2. Pro: It cannot even be called an UBI if it is not universal.
1.13.24.1.2. Con: There is scant evidence that the UBI prevents social critique of the regime in Saudi Arabia. Causality is hard to determine, but pressure on the Kingdom seems to have increased since transfer payments from Oil wealth were introduced.
1.13.24.1.3. Con: Saudi Arabia is also one of the states with the [worst human rights policies](https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110131191445/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/88.pdf) of the world. That the people of Saudi Arabia don't call for a change might have little to do with a UBI.
1.13.24.2. Con: If everyone is "too happy" to care about bad social conditions, then what exactly is it that is so "bad" about them? By that logic any other kind of progress that makes people better off than before should be opposed too on the same grounds.
1.13.24.2.1. Con: While the logic itself is sound, the key element is that it cements "prevailing societal conditions", such as restricting the rights of their female citizens. The argument is akin to saying "The Colonial Slaves had food, shelter, and protection provided to them by their masters, why should they complain?"
1.13.24.2.2. Con: Privilege can blind people to the suffering and states of those not so privileged, such as first-world peoples having only a theoretical understanding of the suffering of those most disadvantaged in the third world.
1.13.24.3. Con: Saying that the UBI is used only to cement government power is misleading. You can say the same for every form of welfare. Maybe the government could act only in an egoistical way but this is still something that makes people's life better. You don't need any proof, if the government gives money to the people it can't be considered something bad.
1.13.24.4. Pro: A UBI is a way of legitimising the capitalist system, by 'paying off' the electorate, disadvantaging future generations and nature.
1.13.24.5. Pro: A UBI can be used to lure voters or group of voters. Political parties can use this as a campaign tool promising unjustified and economically non-viable income to poor voters. This could not just affect economy but also undermines principle of free and fair voting.
1.13.25. Con: Since the bread and wine dole in Rome, successful societies have recognized that their people must be economic as well as political citizens.
1.13.25.1. Con: The Roman grain dole was actually a palliative. The phrase "bread and circuses" is actually coined to describe the act of offering a diversion \(food and entertainment\) instead of good governance and solid public policies. ["Bread and Circuses"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses)
1.13.26. Pro: A UBI indirectly addresses illegal immigration by providing an incentive towards citizenship.
1.14. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.
1.15. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.16. Pro: A UBI helps downsize government bureaucracies.
1.16.1. Pro: A UBI is simpler to administer and is therefore less prone to denying deserving people coverage because of bureaucratic inefficiencies \(delays, miscategorisation of people, and other barriers to access\).
1.16.1.1. Pro: Many people are unaware of the fact that they are eligible for government programs; for example the US [has more than $300 million in unclaimed pension benefits](http://money.cnn.com/2013/01/24/pf/unclaimed-money/index.html). This lack of information often prevents them from accessing their entitlements.
1.16.1.2. Con: That ease comes at the cost of inefficiency of expenditure. The best system would efficiently spend money \(allocate it where it is most needed\) and assume it gets there \(eliminate bureaucratic efficiencies\), but logistical errors in a system do not warrant an entire systemic overhaul.
1.16.1.2.1. Pro: Allowing individual \(distributed\) decision-making provides for the money to flow where it is most needed \(in the recipient's informed opinion\), since the recipients of the UBI stipend will decide how to spend the money.  If the money is most needed in adjacent communities/sectors from those where it was initially disbursed, market forces will eventually drive the UBI money in that direction.
1.16.1.3. Con: Assuming that even a minimal level of currently existing welfare programs need to remain, the existence of a UBI disincentivizes the state to quickly reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies.
1.16.1.3.1. Con: Having fewer welfare programs allows the state to focus on making them efficient instead of having to spread its attention across all of the currently existing programs.
1.16.1.3.2. Pro: The presence of a UBI will demand government attention directed to implementing it. This means that less attention will go towards making other social welfare programs more efficient.
1.16.2. Pro: With a one-size-fits all income transfer there is less need for governments to waste resources tracking down issues such as welfare fraud or when people cross into higher income thresholds.
1.16.3. Con: These government bureaucracies exist for a reason: they help distribute state resources in a targeted fashion. There may be savings that come from removing their jobs but doing so means the government gets less value from its spending.
1.16.3.1. Con: Targeted aid needs conditions, which creates poverty traps, encouraging people to stay at home rather than find a job \(usually insecure and low paid\) [because of the risk of losing the subsidy and passing through the welfare bureaucracy again](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0009.2006.00465.x/full).
1.16.3.1.1. Pro: Targeted welfare programmes occasionally miss their targets because bureaucracy gets in the way and makes it too hard to comply with all the required prerequisites such as attending administration offices, forms completions, record keeping, etc.
1.16.3.1.1.1. Pro: Many people give up on accessing welfare, or do not claim as much as they could, due to the stresses and complexity caused by such conditions.
1.16.3.1.1.2. Pro: Existing welfare programs are dehumanising; they require recipients to proactively prove their need through a series of hostile and complex procedures. A UBI would alleviate this source of stress for the poor.
1.16.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: People on a disability allowance in the UK are [subject to continuous testing of their capability](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/9590852/Botched-tests-deny-the-disabled-their-benefits.html) to work by a company incentivised to deny them further benefits.
1.16.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: 'Middle-class welfare' programs, such as home-mortgage deductions, income splitting, or tax write-offs for having children are all done automatically or through tax returns. Only for the poor does government assistance require such extensive labour and humiliation.
1.16.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: Requiring the poor to jump through government-run hoops to receive assistance is a huge barrier as they are already a group likely to feel rejected and unwanted by the state.
1.16.3.1.1.2.4. Pro: Having to jump through bureaucratic barriers is a huge waste of time for those looking for work and/or who are employed in low-paying jobs.
1.16.3.1.1.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.9.1.1.1.
1.16.3.1.1.2.6. Pro: The [most powerful effect of a universal dividend to Cherokee Nation members](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/08/the-remarkable-ways-a-little-money-can-change-a-childs-personality-for-life/) was in personality effects, whereby recipients \(and their children\) had much lower instances of behavioural and emotional disorders while increased amounts of conscientiousness and agreeableness.
1.16.3.1.1.2.7. Pro: Having a criminal history can discourage or prohibit those in need from applying for welfare and other programs; leaving them without help or assistance.
1.16.3.1.1.2.8. Con: The "hostile and complex" procedures are there to prevent fraud. The able-bodied among the poor could avoid these procedures by hard work, whether that means a side job or going to school \(for which they'd receive aid\).
1.16.3.1.1.2.8.1. Con: Judging purely by "able-bodiedness" ignores psychological and psychiatric considerations.
1.16.3.1.1.2.9. Con: Welfare programs may be described as complicated or inefficient, but not 'dehumanizing.' That someone poor or disabled might have to do some extra paperwork or sit through some inconvenience to receive a monetary benefit or other service offered by society doesn't mean society is treating them as 'less human' - the very fact a benefit is being offered is a sign society acknowledges their humanity and circumstance.
1.16.3.1.1.2.9.1. Con: Welfare programs are not dehumanizing when and because they're sometimes difficult to access; they're dehumanizing when and because they're inquisitorial, hostile, and often feel like they're picking on or kicking the disadvantaged while they're already down. Some even have this as an implicit or explicit policy in order to discourage people from claiming benefits and save the program money - benefits which the majority of claimants are genuinely in need of and legitimately entitled to!
1.16.3.1.1.2.10. Con: While a UBI may be more preferably and efficient in some ways to huge bureaucracies that have the same aim, it seems likely that most modern welfare states would add on a UBI to already existing bureaucratic programs, rather than replace them.
1.16.3.1.1.2.10.1. Con: Even if it would be so those who feel offended or otherwise harm by existing programs could stop using them and live off the UBI.
1.16.3.1.1.2.11. Pro: Nothing is more demeaning that having to convince a welfare worker that you are poor and need assistance. Most state's have a welfare system require beneficiaries to prove that they need help. A blanket UBI improves dignity by removing the need to beg for benefits and by giving everyone the same benefits.
1.16.3.1.1.2.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.19.
1.16.3.1.1.2.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.18.1.1.
1.16.3.1.2. Pro: Welfare programmes which have a waiting period for benefits eligibility will penalise those having short interludes between taking short-term jobs before the benefit payments kick in.
1.16.3.2. Con: With untargeted financial assistance for all of a country, people living there will be able to allocate said funds to suit their own needs. This means less government oversight is necessary. While the targeted nature of spending may be sacrificed, more people would benefit overall, meaning the government would see a different value, rather than less of one.
1.16.3.3. Con: There is an optimal point after which bureaucratic overhead exceeds the gains of their input.
1.16.3.4. Con: This wouldn't eliminate the "task" of allocating resources, it places the burden on those that are using them instead of on the government.
1.16.4. Pro: A simple process applied to many people equally is a lot simpler than many independent agencies and laws coming into play for fewer people.
1.16.4.1. Con: It may be simpler, but some people do not deserve or need a UBI \(wealthy individuals, for example\). Filtering out fewer people - who are in actual need - allows them to get more of the available resources.
1.16.4.2. Pro: A UBI eliminates bureaucracy. Social grants for a multitude of recipients and recipient classes are all encompassed into one disbursement entity. This creates vastly greater efficiency.
1.16.5. Pro: In Nijmegen, in the Netherlands, roughly  [90 million euros is given in welfare, but it costs 16 million](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/26/dutch-city-utrecht-basic-income-uk-greens) euros to run the bureaucracy.
1.16.6. Con: This assumes a UBI would replace most other forms of welfare.
1.16.6.1. Con: -> See 1.6.11.2.
1.16.6.2. Con: There is no specific counter-claim in this claim. Of course UBI replaces other forms of welfare.
1.16.6.3. Con: Even if it didn't supplant other forms of welfare, the assumption offered is a relatively safe one, because of the intent of the UBI to replace welfare \(as in the original claim\).
1.16.6.4. Pro: The general idea of UBI is the replacement of all welfare programmes with unconditional income. So: yes, your assumption is correct.
1.16.7. Con: Moving to a UBI system would put thousands of government employees, currently working in the welfare system, out of work. The transition will be difficult, and needs to be handled delicately.
1.16.7.1. Con: The transition would be softened considerably by the new UBI program.
1.16.7.2. Con: At least some of them would be needed to handle the logistics of the new UBI system.
1.16.8. Con: UBI is a centralized system therefore it is subject to the [single point of failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure) problem.
1.16.9. Pro: A UBI achieves both the progressive goal of providing a safety net for workers and the conservative goal of downsizing government - hence it can unify otherwise disparate political aspects of society.
1.16.9.1. Con: A UBI doesn't ultimately achieve Conservative Goals. It hands even more power to a centralized structure through the non-voluntary confiscation of resources \(higher taxes\) eliminating individual agency and freedom. The power to choose how one spends their own resources largely disappears. Conservatives aren't in favor of higher taxes for most anything — more authority over our collective resources increases the power of governments rather than decreases it.
1.16.9.1.1. Con: Conservative goals often reduce safety, stability, health, quality of life, agency, and freedom for the underprivileged and less fortunate.
1.16.10. Con: The management of the UBI will increase the size of the government to answer the question of how gets it, when and how much.
1.16.10.1. Con: Those questions are inherently easier to answer of a UBI than they are to answer for targeted welfare schemes which have many conditions to ponder and regulate. Given a UBI will displace at least some of those welfare schemes the result is likely to be a net decrease in the size of government.
1.16.11. Pro: A UBI is cheaper to administer than existing welfare systems and thus frees would-be bureaucrats to contribute to the economy and thus wastes less money.
1.16.12. Con: While downsizing government bureaucracies in general would help save taxpayers' money, replacing welfare with a UBI would ultimately cost taxpayers much more because of the immense cost of the policy.
1.16.12.1. Con: Citizens will likely spend their UBI payments on taxable goods and services and therefore mitigate some of its own cost.
1.16.12.2. Con: The costs of a UBI do not say anything about the size of the bureaucracy needed to implement it.
1.16.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.16.12.4. Con: [Here is an example](http://www.aei.org/publication/a-budget-neutral-universal-basic-income/) of a budget neutral application of basic income, from the American Enterprise Institute.
1.16.12.5. Con: -> See 1.3.14.1.
1.16.12.6. Con: -> See 1.4.10.1.1.7.1.1.3.2.1.
1.17. Pro: A UBI enhances the freedom and dignity of individuals.
1.17.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.17.2.
1.17.2. Con: There is nothing dignified about getting money for nothing. A sense of dignity comes from experiencing the accomplishment of a job well done, and the value one's work provides to others - which is primarily expressed through payment. Thus, earning one's living is dignified, whereas living off others is not.
1.17.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.8.3.
1.17.2.2. Con: Dignity need not derive solely, or mostly, from work. This definition of dignity is just one normative standard based on rewarding notions of individual effort and responsibility with resources. Dignity could be said to derive from justice or equity, whereby resources are allocated based on an individual or societal need rather than having to be 'earned' solely through labour.
1.17.2.3. Con: Much work is hard, not properly compensated, thankless, and seems completely pointless to those who are doing the job. There is nothing dignified about such work.
1.17.2.3.1. Con: Apart from immoral and otherwise unproper jobs, work is dignifying and has real value for society: if it didn't have value it wouldn't be paid. If it is otherwise it is problem of administrative or political reason, becouse no individual will pay for work of no value.
1.17.2.3.1.1. Con: A penny has real value, but it costs more to make then it is actually worth. The jobs many people are forced to work with have the relative work to value relation of pennies.
1.17.2.3.1.1.1. Con: This is administrative problem — the penny should not be made further and prices should either adapt to a higher nominal value or the problem should be covered somehow else. If covering such problem would be more costly or improper for other reasons, then it means the penny's value is not only it's nominal but also includes the cost of this problem solving.
1.17.2.3.2. Con: That work still needs to be done regardless of UBI.
1.17.2.3.2.1. Con: If the work needs to be done, then companies can properly compensate people to the point where they want to do them.
1.17.2.3.2.2. Con: Empowering workers with a UBI encourages employers to rethink the necessity \(and methods of completing\) tasks widely disliked and considered unpleasant and/or unnecessary.
1.17.2.4. Pro: One of the [psychological benefits](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Warr3/publication/16154562_Psychological_aspects_of_employment_and_unemployment/links/564a2f8108ae295f644fbc44.pdf?inViewer=0&pdfJsDownload=0&origin=publication_detail) of employment is that it "provides a personal identity and status within social institutions. The employed person occupies a role, with associated rights and obligations which are not possessed by those out of work."
1.17.2.4.1. Con: This logic seems at face value like it would apply just the same to slavery. Slavery is obviously not desirable.
1.17.2.4.2. Con: The benefits of employment do not require that it be paid work. A UBI can enable people to do voluntary work for institutions or people who cannot afford paid staff, giving the workers the benefits of employment and providing value to society through their labour. Someone who cannot do voluntary work without risking losing their benefits is unable to provide value to society and gain the benefits of employment by volunteering.
1.17.2.5. Pro: According to [Catholic social teaching](http://www.catholicsocialteaching.org.uk/themes/dignity-in-work/), "work is dignified and an intrinsic good, and workers must always be respected and valued." As Saint John Paul II put it, "Only man is capable of work, and only man works, at the same time by work occupying his existence on earth. Thus work bears a particular mark of man and of humanity, the mark of a person operating within a community of persons. And this mark decides its interior characteristics; in a sense it constitutes its very nature."
1.17.2.5.1. Con: Not everyone lives by or follows the social teachings of Catholicism. Thus their perspective on what is considered or cultivates dignity, cannot be applied to every citizen.
1.17.2.5.1.1. Con: From whom the statement comes is less important than what it states. John Paul II was cited not because of his authority, but because he described an idea in well-fitting words.
1.17.2.5.2. Con: Many workers aren't respected or valued by their places of business.
1.17.2.5.2.1. Pro: [Some places of business deny their female employees parts of their earned medical benefit compensation as a way of cutting costs.​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc.)
1.17.2.5.2.2. Pro: If the workers were respected, they would be paid at least a living wage; instead many people need 2 or 3 jobs to stay afloat.
1.17.2.5.3. Con: With the introduction and proliferation of automation and AI into the production systems, it is now obvious that John Paul II was wrong when he asserted that "only man is capable of work, and only man works."
1.17.2.5.4. Con: There are dogs in police, border control and other places, which also do work.
1.17.2.5.5. Con: Many philosophical perspectives, such as utilitarianism, value quality and enjoyment of life over production, productivity, and labour.
1.17.2.6. Con: If dignity accrues from feeling accomplished in your work and feeling that your work has value, that diginity doesn't accrue if you actively dislike the work you do. A UBI would free poorer individuals to take risks in order to choose work that they enjoy, in contrast to the current limited work options for a person worried about securing their basic needs.
1.17.2.6.1. Con: You could dislike your work, but know it has value and is needed — therefore feeling dignified by doing it.
1.17.2.7. Con: Dignity is linked to confidence and certainty, which in turn is reduced by poverty and economic uncertainty. A UBI could help to mitigate the latter two factors, and thereby increase individuals' confidence and dignity.
1.17.2.8. Con: There are [societies which highly respect the elderly](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/25/what-other-cultures-can-teach_n_4834228.html) even though they do not actively earn money and frequently may cause costs.
1.17.2.9. Con: While taking money for nothing is not dignified, receiving payment for the sole fact that you are a part of society provides a feeling of dignity.
1.17.2.10. Con: Provided it is true we could observe, that people desires to be accepted by community. Thus they would strive to get a job and earn funds to get rid of etiquete of lazy-bones. UBI would could provide them such possibility and by that lead them on the way of dignity.
1.17.2.10.1. Pro: People can be more proactive and productive if their daily struggles are lessened. If their quality of life goes up, so may the quality of their contributions.
1.17.2.11. Pro: The proper question should be: is it moral to ask one person to support another person of equal means with equal capacity for self-sufficiency? Ignoring any wealth disparity, it would be immoral to require a random person to financially support another random person that is capable of supporting themselves. A UBI is just applied this principle at scale and so, by extension, it is thus better to fix targeted welfare schemes than to create a UBI.
1.17.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.8.
1.17.4. Con: A UBI would further erode individual liberty and responsibility leading to more government control over citizens.
1.17.4.1. Pro: The incentives that a UBI provides to having children may lead to government-mandated breeding restrictions or forceful sterilizations to prevent certain groups from having children; a move that would harshly curtail [people's reproductive liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights).
1.17.4.1.1. Con: Even when security is provided the [birthrate stabilizes below the replacement rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_and_fertility#Fertility_J-curve) independently of culture.
1.17.4.1.2. Pro: Since people can breed far beyond their means to acquire the resources of others, this may create resentment and a population beyond current capacities, leading to resentment and fights over resources. Since people are enabled to breed beyond their means they will then become a target for restrictions due to resource limitations or disruptions to quality of life from a surge of new children.
1.17.4.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.12.4.
1.17.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.12.
1.17.4.2. Con: A restructuring of social programming into simple cash transfers allow people to decide what the money is spent on, rather than bureaucrats deciding for them. This enhances individual liberty and autonomy.
1.17.4.2.1. Con: Aside from a minarchist system there is no form of governance where no negative rights are infringed. There can be no individual liberty when people are forced by the government to transfer money to others \(coercive redistribution\).
1.17.4.2.1.1. Con: Individual liberty must be protected by some organization at some expense, as there are many individuals who would otherwise be willing to infringe others' rights for their own benefit. Therefore, some form of government is necessary and essential for protecting individuals' rights.
1.17.4.3. Pro: There may be rules implemented in which an individual loses their right to their UBI based on certain circumstances or actions, making a tool to control behavior.
1.17.4.3.1. Con: Current social programs already do that. Current private contracts do that, as well.
1.17.4.3.1.1. Con: Just because other programs do this does not mean other programs ought to do it.
1.17.4.3.1.1.1. Con: It is probably wrong for existing programs, and individuals to exploit people, but this isn't a reason not to have a new program that might exploit people when all the existing ones definitely do.
1.17.4.3.1.2. Con: A UBI would be applied to a wider group, therefore it would affect more people and, by that lead to a greater erosion of liberty.
1.17.4.3.2. Pro: It is hardly a violation of due process for the government to regulate that of which is subsidises, i.e. the mandatory drug tests now [mandatory for those on welfare in Australia](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-22/welfare-recipients-could-face-drug-tests-as-early-as-january/8827288). The same draconian laws could come to apply to all under a UBI.
1.17.4.3.3. Con: That wouldn't be a Universal Basic Income, then, as it would lose the Universal aspect.
1.17.4.3.4. Con: The conditions imposed upon current welfare recipients \(drugs testing; forced budgeting\) would be unpalatable if extended outside the lower classes. Thus they are unlikely to ever be conditions of a universal benefit.
1.17.4.3.5. Con: In that case, it cannot be really called an UBI, it would just be another welfare program. UBI as a program is only relevant if it is truly universal. Even people in the prison system should be entitled to an UBI, even if they cannot use it while they are in jail. This would provide them with either a way to help their families during incarceration or small savings for when they leave the prison, reducing recidivism.
1.17.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.13.24.1.
1.17.4.5. Con: -> See 1.7.14.3.2.
1.17.4.6. Pro: Having a UBI puts the government entirely in control of the citizens' lives and gives the citizens no power.
1.17.4.6.1. Con: If it is universal, there are no conditions citizens would have to follow; everyone gets it
1.17.4.6.2. Con: Having welfare programs actually puts the government entirely in control of the citizens' lives, as welfare promotes doing nothing because people who work more, get less. With a UBI, people who work more, get more.
1.17.4.6.2.1. Con: It is not strictly true to say that people who work more get less under welfare programs. There are many jobs which pay more than welfare programs.
1.17.4.6.2.2. Pro: Welfare programs are designed to apply only to individuals with a specific income or less, which means that effectively, if a person on welfare is able to improve its income by only a couple of dollars above the cut, they will no longer qualify for welfare, eliminating a large portion of their income. This is an incentive for people to never to reach this point, effectively converting welfare into a way to limit the desire of people to progress.
1.17.4.6.3. Con: Citizens would continue to have the exact same power they have now: elect a new government that may or may not make changes to the UBI program.
1.17.4.6.4. Pro: Consider the seriousness of this statement being true. All other liberties erode on the premise of the statement being true ie all citizens lives are controlled...There is only a forced choice, it is an antithesis to rationality. Therefore, all other statements concerning the true value of the state can be seen as not true.
1.17.4.6.5. Pro: UBI will make many citizens completely dependent on the central government and the UBI program for their livelihoods and therefore citizens' freedom and autonomy.
1.17.4.6.5.1. Pro: It would be harmful for citizens to become solely reliant on the government to provide sustenance. As the population grows, the system would become unaffordable, leaving a low skilled workforce with no means to support themselves.
1.17.4.6.6. Con: -> See 1.7.14.3.2.
1.17.4.7. Con: A UBI cannot erode personal liberty as it affords choice where none before existed. A UBI does not erode responsibility as it compels those previously without means to be responsible for utilising this new resource within their life.
1.17.4.7.1. Con: A UBI would be given to everybody, so it would also target those, who now have responsibility of earning at least a minimum of money to survive and erode that responsibility.
1.17.4.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.3.
1.17.5. Con: Given existing welfare schemes often result in parents being criticised for having children \(and thus receiving extra assistance payouts\) a UBI is likely to dramatically increase this effect and potentially lead to greater disincentives to having children.
1.17.5.1. Pro: A UBI could lead to population control, as there can't be even the most basic income for everyone if the population gets big enough.
1.17.5.1.1. Pro: As adults become wealthier they are more likely to consider having more children, therefore increasing the demand on society to put more into the UBI and nullifying any improvements in quality of life over all. Some population controls may need to be put into place to reduce the chance of overpopulation.
1.17.5.2. Pro: A UBI is likely to increase births. Having more children [increases](http://green.blogs.nytimes.com//2009/08/07/having-children-brings-high-carbon-impact/) a family's carbon footprint, particularly in developed Western countries. Thus any policies that encourage this should be avoided for the preservation and health of the planet.
1.17.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.12.7.1.
1.17.5.2.2. Pro: An uncontrolled fertility rate has already been the reason for governmental intervention, e.g. [China's One Child Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy), to contain the negative environmental and socioeconomic consequences.
1.17.5.2.2.1. Con: A fertility increment - which in many countries is necessary to insure the rate of natural increase \([RNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_natural_increase)\) - is not an “uncontrolled fertility rate”. Moreover, the attempts to control birth rates by forced and brutal methods such the policies implemented in China have had [disastrous](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/chinas-onechild-policy-a-demographic-disaster/news-story/5a71127133138acec2644df76f01d9b0) demographical consequences.
1.17.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.12.7.2.
1.17.5.2.4. Con: US birth rate versus income refutes this claim entirely. Well-off people [have fewer kids](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241530/birth-rate-by-family-income-in-the-us/) so UBI will reduce birth rates.
1.17.5.2.5. Con: While the claim that poverty is correlated, casually or not, with lower birthrates is dubious at best, even if the point is conceded, the solution to overpopulation surely cannot be opposition to proposals which aim to reduce poverty.
1.17.5.2.5.1. Pro: Increasing poverty - or deliberately not reducing it where one could - as a solution to overpopulation is not far removed from a "kill the poor" solution.
1.17.5.2.6. Con: This argument implies that any amount of human suffering is acceptable if it reduces the birth rate.
1.17.5.2.7. Con: Lessening immigration \([the reason why the US is gaining population](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-study/immigrants-will-drive-u-s-population-growth-in-next-five-decades-pew-idUSKCN0RS08V20150928)\) can counteract this situation. Then the countries with emigrants will need to solve their own overpopulation problems as they have less options to leave. They will also have a lower carbon footprint in their country.
1.17.5.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.2.12.7.1.
1.17.5.4. Con: Planet Earth is overpopulated. A reduction in \(unsustainable\) birth rate in the mid-term could be considered an advantage of UBI, and could also allow room for population redistribution from more overpopulated regions.
1.17.5.4.1. Pro: Later on, birth rates may increase closer to the replacement rate again when Earth and humans are under less resource strain, and the need for more people is more apparent, as opposed to there being a general knowledge of the overpopulated state of the world among educated people.
1.17.5.5. Con: UBI may incentivise population growth to an unsustainable level since it removes the need to provide for the basic necesities of children.
1.17.5.6. Con: Even if people would be highly criticised for having children if a UBI would be functional - it would rather lead to an increase in population, as extra money from the government for having children now leads to.
1.17.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.6.
1.17.7. Con: The fact that a system benefits some people is a weak argument in favour of it's morality. For example, if a person were to murder someone and take all their money, that would be objectively beneficial to that person, but it would ignore the effect on the other.
1.17.7.1. Con: Leaving people to suffer and die in poverty is also not moral behaviour, and taxing the mega wealthy likely wouldn't even change their personal lifestyles, merely affect their investments.
1.17.7.2. Con: Dignity and freedom are highly valuable and by UBI would be achived by taking away less important ones, therefore UBI is exchange from low value to high value, while mentioned example works in opposite direction.
1.17.7.2.1. Pro: UBI would be most probably achieved by higher taxation or decreasing spends on some other goods provided by goverment. Therefore it is exchange of possibility to keep all money you earn now \(by making this sum lower\) to freedom dignity etc. for those who are in greatest need of such values.
1.17.8. Con: A UBI does not prevent people from ["running the rat race"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rat%20race): where taking in more money leads to spending more money without increasing the quality-of-life. The endless time spent to get nowhere is not dignifying for an individual.
1.17.8.1. Con: UBI may not adress this particular problem, but adress many others connected with dignity.
1.17.9. Pro: A UBI enables the poor to exert more control over where and how they purchase essentials such as food and housing that would otherwise be limited to what is provided through welfare.
1.17.9.1. Con: UBI is another wealth re-distribution scheme that ultimately reduces the choices of consumers, the quality of goods & services.  [Problems with UBI Schemes](https://mises.org/blog/dangers-universal-basic-income)
1.17.9.2. Con: A UBI is unlikely to provide people with enough income to significantly expand their freedom of choice. People who are poor will still be significantly less well off than the rich.
1.17.9.2.1. Con: People who currently must take a job or starve will have the freedom to keep looking for something better. People are less likely to feel trapped under a UBI.
1.17.9.2.2. Con: Low-income people often feel trapped by the location of the social programs they currently receive. With a UBI that people can take with them when they migrate within a country, people will have better opportunities to relocate.
1.17.9.2.3. Con: The greatest marginal value of UBI funds would be to the least mobile and skilled in society. The assurance of a consistent revenue stream, regardless of where a person lives, opens up myriad possible life changes which would simply be inaccessible for someone caught in the crushing wheel of poverty. UBI increases personal freedom and mobility.
1.17.9.2.4. Con: There will always be someone who is relatively better off. However, financial security does allow more room for freedom of choice.
1.17.9.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.7.1.4.
1.17.10. Con: A UBI degrades the freedom and dignity of those who are forced to pay for it.
1.17.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.
1.17.10.2. Pro: It is immoral to legislate that citizens who work hard for their pay, forfeit a portion of it to other citizens who didn't.
1.17.10.2.1. Con: We already do pay taxes to help support those who can't support themselves. This is just a different method of distributing that help.
1.17.10.3. Con: A UBI relieves the rich of guilt. To provide the most basic living standard to every member will make rich people feel better about themselves, because they don't need to hear about people who live below the poverty line in their environment anymore.
1.17.10.4. Pro: UBI is a form of forcible income redistribution, which violates people's right to their private property.
1.17.10.4.1. Con: The right to basic living conditions is a more important than the right to private property.
1.17.10.4.2. Con: -> See 1.17.10.2.1.
1.17.10.4.3. Con: If a UBI was funded through taxation, it would be a legitimate government service.
1.17.10.5. Pro: UBI [relatively disadvantages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16255446) the [working segment of a society](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/working-class), since it will be payed out from their taxes.
1.17.10.5.1. Con: -> See 1.17.10.2.1.
1.17.10.6. Pro: UBI requires forced payments from taxpayers who may be unwilling, it is therefore immoral and if voted in, represents the tyranny of the 51%.
1.17.10.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.4.2.2.1.
1.17.11. Pro: A UBI improves the mental and physical health of a population.
1.17.11.1. Pro: A UBI would allow for short term illness, or disability to be dealt with in a non-exploitative or demeaning way. Further the lifestyle and quality of life would not have to alter completely, nor would medical bills pile up causing a continued cycle of debt and poverty.
1.17.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.16.6.
1.17.11.3. Pro: UBI improves the health of the population, because it reduces stress.
1.17.11.4. Pro: Income transfers are some of the most effective means of [improving health outcomes](https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/alphaweb.site-ym.com/resource/collection/86D31666-E7EA-42F1-BDA1-A03ECA0B4E3D/OnPhysicians_Letter_BIG_170815.pdf) and being healthy is a fundamental precursor to almost all other rights and freedoms.
1.17.11.4.1. Con: Government regulates levels of societal freedom more than health. Take two individuals, one very healthy and one with a terminal disease; both can live in the same totalitarian society a with equally little freedoms.
1.17.11.4.1.1. Con: The person with the poorer health will still have fewer freedoms. \(E.g. limited access to public services, time consuming treatments, ...\)
1.17.11.4.1.2. Con: There will always be some limitations for what you can do, the freedom given by UBI is that people get power \(monetary power\) and can choose what to do with it — without the threat and fear of not being able to survive.
1.17.11.5. Pro: UBI will improve health which will lead to less money being spent on treatment, and higher productivity due to reduced presenteeism. This is supported by an 8.5% reduction in hospitalization observed in the Dauphin, Manitoba experiment, and the loss of an estimated $250 billion a year from people going to work sick when they should be staying home but feel they have no choice. UBI is like a vaccine. An ounce of prevention is far cheaper than a pound of cure.
1.17.11.5.1. Con: Better health while in poverty will mean more women in poverty will choose to have children out of wedlock, thus increasing the population of government dependants and the social problems associated with single parent families.
1.17.11.5.1.1. Con: Better health while in poverty doesn't imply more children out of wedlock. For better health to exist there has to be reproductive health services which will in turn address this issue. This correlation does not seem to happen.
1.17.11.5.1.2. Con: Reduction of poverty means that women - in or out of wedlock - are better able to access things such as contraception, and thus better able to avoid unwanted children. This is likely to balance any increase in the number of those who choose to have children that they may not want to have if poorer - but may still have anyway.
1.17.11.5.1.3. Con: The same logic could be used to attack any initiative that would increase the health of people in poverty. This is not sufficient reason to avoid improving the health and living conditions of those living in poverty.
1.17.11.5.2. Pro: In medicine poverty is considered a Risk Factor for a lot of diseases. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_of_poverty)
1.17.11.6. Con: UBI could lead to a breakdown in society. The inclination of too many in society would be toward detrimental actions to ones health if allowed more idle time.
1.17.11.6.1. Con: Many people already engage in very self-destructive actions and activities; the overall societal impacts, while noticeable, have not yet been catastrophic.
1.17.11.7. Pro: As job security becomes less stable with AI technologies, mental health problems related to redundancies could cost a lot of money. A UBI would not only provide income security, but cost countries less in mental health related services.
1.17.11.8. Pro: A UBI can improve health, as was the case with India's experiment in 2010. See the India section in[UBI, 5 experiments from around the world](https://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/universal-basic-income-5-experiments-from-around-the-world-1): The trial resulted in a sharp increase in food sufficiency and a drop in illness in villages that received the funds compared to those that did not."
1.17.12. Pro: A UBI can have a positive impact on societal practices and culture by acknowledging the inherent humanity of all citizens.
1.17.12.1. Pro: A UBI provides unconditional help to all people, while existing welfare systems have limited range.
1.17.12.1.1. Pro: Placing conditions on the receipt of social benefits saps political support from the idea as it divides society into recipients and contributors. For example, Medicare in the US receives broad support because it is so broadly applied.
1.17.12.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.12.2.
1.17.12.1.3. Pro: The current economic systems is extremely unfair, often because of corrupt management and lack of workplaces.
1.17.12.2. Con: The idea that you are owed money simply for existing is toxic. Your humanity guarantees you protection from your fellow humans and the state - negative freedoms. It does not permit you to force your fellow citizen to serve you.
1.17.12.2.1. Con: There is no such thing as a pure "negative right". All rights require enforcement, and all enforcement requires labor. Even a right to be left alone is generally considered to require the labor of an enforcing police presence.
1.17.12.2.1.1. Con: A "negative right" is defined by no one having to do anything in order to respect it, as opposed to a "positive right" that requires action in order to not violate it. Enforcement is an entirely different matter, as it only becomes relevant to guard against and punish violations of rights.
1.17.12.2.2. Con: This individualism is simplistic. Actions by groups of fellow humans and the state negatively affect humans inadvertently - most humans, for instance, cannot simply leave organized society and subsist off the land, and thereby are inevitably reliant on the state/society and other humans for their subsistence, due to past and present actions of the state and humanity as a collective. This arguably creates a duty from the state to humans in general.
1.17.12.3. Pro: A UBI makes money less important and puts the value in making life wonderful. We tend to translate everything into economic terms; distracting our attention to what its important. When one feels secure with UBI its less probable that people will get distracted by concerns of financial security. One can focus on doing things, even for free, and let life's rewards come without fear.
1.17.12.4. Pro: A UBI sends a message of trust from government to citizens. Trust is usually responded to by accepting responsibility and willing to be trustworthy.
1.17.12.4.1. Con: Welfare programs also send a message of trust from governments to citizens, as they have to trust that their benefits will be dispersed monthly, the same as UBI has been proposed.
1.17.12.5. Pro: A UBI eliminates mankind's existential angst. Waking up every morning with no worries about how to maintain your life unleashes the best in people.
1.17.12.5.1. Con: One of Ghandi's 7 sins is [wealth without work](http://www.mkgandhi.org/mgmnt.htm). The reason for this is simple: that our lives are enriched by purpose and accomplishment. Helping someone over a hump is one thing but paying charity over time reduces the quality of life which is inhuman.
1.17.12.5.1.1. Con: This argument is deeply entrenched in the virtue theory of morality, to the point of ignoring any of the other ethical frameworks. [Social contract theories](http://www.iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/), for example, suggest that it's none of your business what other people do as long as it doesn't effect you.
1.17.12.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.6.
1.17.12.5.1.3. Con: Given Ghandi was a [deeply socialist political actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhian_economics), the levels of 'wealth' he is referring here probably refers to the resources of the rich; not a guarantee by the state that everyone is able to live just above the poverty line.
1.17.12.5.1.3.1. Con: This is not an exclusive matter; "wealth without work" can easily refer to both scenarios.
1.17.12.5.1.3.1.1. Con: It seems much more plausible that Ghandi did not think of the state providing basic resources as a 'sin' given that was one of the policies he implemented and maintained.
1.17.12.5.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.6.2.1.5.5.
1.17.12.5.2. Pro: A UBI will enable people to think about life's important questions more. The Earth and our human societies find themselves in the dire situations today, because we haven't given proper importance to the individual to answer these questions for themselves. Questioning life is what gets us out of this way of thinking, and is the beginning to a philosophical and spiritual education.
1.17.12.5.2.1. Con: Arguably, having an uninspiring and demotivating job makes us ponder these questions more than otherwise.
1.17.12.5.2.1.1. Con: Not for the majority of the population who live with minimum income to make their basic needs, they are more focused on surviving; hence not able to afford energy to improve society.
1.17.12.5.2.2. Con: There is no evidence that people will spend more time in contemplation of spiritual questions with a UBI. If a UBI is enabling recipients to partake in jobs and ventures that feel more meaningful for them, they may have less unstructured time.
1.17.12.5.2.3. Pro: For anyone whose primary concern is their own immediate physical and financial security for themselves and family, such personal need will eclipse any beneficial concern for community and habitat. UBI enhances the likelihood that most people will consider the common good.
1.17.12.5.2.3.1. Pro: Many people who work may wish to do more meaningful or charitable labour, but are aware there is less or no money in it in most cases.
1.17.12.5.2.4. Pro: UBI allows people to make more ethical decisions based on want and fewer coerced decisions based on need. Legally and socially criminal behavior for some is a choice but for many it is the only viable choice they feel they have to survive.
1.17.12.5.3. Con: UBI reduces worries about basic needs \(i.e shelter, food etc.\), but does not by itself deliver incentives to stretch for self-actualization \(i.e. following your passion\) rather than solely giving in to short-term driven urges \(e.g. playing video games for the sake of instant gratification\).
1.17.12.5.3.1. Con: An individual whose basic needs are met doesn't have to pursue self actualization, it is a personal choice. However if a UBI cannot make that individual seek self-actualization, neither can a job. So if nothing can truly make the individual want to pursue what's good for them, we can only reduce what prevents an individual from doing so.
1.17.12.5.4. Con: Existential Angst can also be a feeling of emptiness, or lack of purpose. If we accept [Maslow's Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) of needs to be somewhat true, we can fathom that even if basic human needs are met, there will always be other needs. A UBI doesn't really extinguish that angst.
1.17.12.5.4.1. Con: Accepting some of Maslow's hierarchical conception of needs entails recognizing that some needs are "higher" than others. Higher needs that follow from the fulfillment of "lower" needs are not subject to feelings of emptiness or angst, as fulfillment of needs leads to climbing the pyramid toward self-actualization.
1.17.12.5.5. Pro: If the only thing ensuring initiative would be the drive to provide oneself's sustenance, then there would be no volunteer organisations.
1.17.12.5.5.1. Con: If the point implied above were valid, organizing a UBI through voluntary contributions to a non-government organization would be the superior solution.
1.17.12.5.5.1.1. Con: The point above showed a valid counterpoint, saying it's not strong enough to support a whole economic policy does not nullify it.
1.17.12.5.6. Con: No amount of money will eliminate existential angst. But, feeling worried about your economic future is an incentive to seek work and growth. In this way a UBI reduces the marginal utility of producing.
1.17.12.5.6.1. Con: Work does not necessarily lead to growth. It can simply lead to stress, exhaustion, frustration, desperation, hatred, etc.. Poor job fits — and people feeling like they have little other choice but to remain in them — can even lead to depression and suicide.
1.17.12.5.6.2. Con: If you pay attention you will see that one thing that every great past thinker had in common is that none of them was worried about surviving. That said each person has their own spectrum of what is "essential to survival."
1.17.12.6. Pro: United Nations' [Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) Article 25 states that "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family ..." In a world of increasing job scarcity and rising job specialization, requiring fewer workers, UBI could be the only sustenance for hundreds of millions of people.
1.17.12.6.1. Con: Recognising the 'right' to something doesn't mean that everyone has to be provided with it.
1.17.12.6.1.1. Pro: In some situations it's impossible to answer even most crucial needs.
1.17.12.6.1.1.1. Pro: There are places where high standard medical care is unavailable.
1.17.12.6.1.1.1.1. Con: A UBI will help to fund the purchase of medical services in such areas, thus incentivizing their provision and sale.
1.17.12.6.1.1.2. Pro: There are places where access to food and water is highly limited.
1.17.12.6.1.1.2.1. Con: A UBI will help to fund the transport and sale of food and water to such locales.
1.17.12.6.1.1.3. Con: The occurrence of such situations should be reduced, and a UBI is one possible vehicle to do so.
1.17.12.7. Pro: UBI is fair because those who work also get help, not only the ones who don't contribute to society.
1.17.12.7.1. Con: A UBI would help only those, who earn less than average, because it would be financed from taxes, so those who earn more would pay more for UBI to exist, than they recieve from it.
1.17.12.7.1.1. Con: This threshold to receive a net benefit would likely be much higher than just the average income level, given progressive taxation means that the most wealthy continue a disproportionate amount of tax revenue.
1.17.12.7.1.1.1. Con: Such tax would have to be highly progressive to function properly, because rich people have lawyers, who help them to minimise the amount of tax they pay.
1.17.12.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: Some of most richest would decide to move or at least pay taxes somewhere else.
1.17.12.7.1.1.2. Con: A highly progresive tax, which would be needed to support such option, would hurt the economy significantly by reducing the motivation to earn \(and by that produce\) more of those who provide huge part of GDP.
1.17.12.7.2. Con: A UBI would hurt richest, who provide significant input into economic development.
1.17.12.7.2.1. Con: Wealthy individuals are not the only source of input for economic development; collective projects and large-scale voluntary donations can also finance development, as can governments.
1.17.12.7.2.2. Con: Many wealthy people act against the common good, creating more damage than improvement.
1.17.12.8. Pro: The economic consequences of wealth redistribution must be seen in philosophical and material terms. UBI is a humanist approach: supporting people because they exist. Against this is a materialist approach dehumanizing people to be mere earners and not able to appreciate life's demands to advance oneself.
1.17.12.9. Pro: A UBI at the least should be considered a human right, as there are not near enough job opportunities to earn more than a basic amount of income.
1.17.12.10. Pro: Current welfare systems incentivize the poor to value working over their physical and mental health. A UBI affords individuals more freedom to enjoy a greater quality of life.
1.17.12.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.
1.17.12.10.2. Pro: Society and government undervalue health and family life and instead [overvalue working](https://politicsandculture.org/2012/05/02/leisure-the-sacred-gesture-and-human-dignity-thorstein-veblen-and-josef-piepers-understandings-of-leisure/). We begin to value the quality of our own lives when we are not working solely out of necessity.
1.17.12.10.2.1. Pro: Under capitalism, the meaning of [leisure](https://politicsandculture.org/2012/05/02/leisure-the-sacred-gesture-and-human-dignity-thorstein-veblen-and-josef-piepers-understandings-of-leisure/) has been undermined by what is considered its opposite: work. Leisure is not merely free or unoccupied time, but rather time spent thoughtfully at your own discretion.
1.17.12.10.3. Con: If low-income people start substantially reducing the amounts they work, this is likely to trigger substantial political backlash to the UBI \(as low-income individuals are perceived to be leeching off of society\), which will result in reductions in the UBI and increased stigma against low-income workers.
1.17.12.10.3.1. Con: It requires a lot more political capital to reduce UBI payments \(because that affects everyone\) than to cut welfare entitlements.
1.17.13. Pro: A UBI empowers marginalised groups who lack influence due to economic barriers.
1.17.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.15.2.
1.17.13.2. Con: Economic "empowerment" to the bare minimum of basic needs does not allow marginalized voices to be heard because those individuals are still at the bottom of the heap, where there is a lot of noise. A UBI does not eliminate poverty, it simply redefines it.
1.17.13.2.1. Con: By providing money for basic needs, a UBI would allow marginalized individuals and groups to spend more time and possibly even money on making themselves heard.
1.17.13.3. Pro: A UBI will provide basic human needs and enable higher intelligence in the lower class. When people have time to think about other things than surviving the day, they can better think, evaluate choices and make long term decisions. Hunger, stress and insufficient safety result in a preoccupied  mind.
1.17.13.3.1. Pro: When given a UBI, people can use the money to fix these problems so they can focus on doing well at a job.
1.17.13.4. Pro: UBI would be a great start to eliminating homelessness, boosting the economic rims of society. Yes we are only here on earth a short time, why not give some enjoyment to those that are struggling with this winner take all game of capitalism, everyone will benefit.  The enhance flow of money can only be a good thing for all evolved. Let us not be so selfish and greedy to deny our fellow Americans. Lots of blood sweat and tears have been shed developing this great country, let's act like!
1.17.13.5. Pro: Wealth is also a significant predictor of [civic engagement](http://www.people-press.org/2015/01/08/the-politics-of-financial-insecurity-a-democratic-tilt-undercut-by-low-participation/). A UBI will provide people from less advantaged backgrounds the agency and status necessary to push for the types of political change that would not be possible otherwise due to financial discrimination.
1.17.13.5.1. Pro: A UBI changes incentives for politicians who have to more actively target or incorporate traditionally politically excluded groups.
1.17.13.5.2. Con: They still only have a finite degree of political capital when engaging with elites. If wealthy people already feel as though they are contributing towards the UBI they are less likely to support these kinds of initiatives.
1.17.13.5.2.1. Con: The majority decides what's best for the society, not just the wealthy.
1.17.13.5.3. Con: NGOs and other special interest groups are able to take on the burden of this form of engagement. E.g. the NAACP in the US.
1.17.13.5.3.1. Con: These NGOs and advocacy groups are much stronger and greater political forces in a world where their constituents have more access to capital.
1.17.13.5.3.2. Con: These groups cannot speak to all of the diverse interests and desires of their own constituency.
1.17.13.6. Con: Empowering marginalised groups is contingent on providing them meaningful amounts of wealth. An income just above the poverty line is neither meaningful wealth nor economic inclusion.
1.17.13.6.1. Con: A UBI provides as a baseline an income below the poverty line; increase your income above poverty line would then be relatively easy to achieve — so long as you work to supplement your UBI. Basic income schemes are characterized by a low clawback rate, such that it would be challenging to have even a part-time minimum-wage job and still sit below the poverty line.
1.17.13.6.2. Con: A UBI ensures one's most important needs are accounted for in a stable manner. This is still incredibly meaningful for disenfranchised groups and enables far more political engagement.
1.17.14. Con: While emotionally satisfying to the giver the payment lowers the dignity of the receiver. There is nothing more uplifting than knowing that the roof over your head and food on the table was brought about by your hard work. Not given to you by those that believe you cannot do for yourself.
1.17.14.1. Con: There is no indignity in receiving the same UBI as everyone does, even the richest. The UBI will in fact eliminate the indignity by eliminating the dependency on welfare.
1.17.15. Con: It is not the role of government to ensure the dignity of individuals.
1.17.15.1. Con: Governments such as the German one have a legal duty and task to ensure human dignity. [Art. 1 GG \(1\)](https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/EN/StatischeSeiten/breg/basic-law-content-list.html;jsessionid=F476E9FC87CF25504294CA2DE1231A13.s2t2?nn=447370#doc94410bodyText2) "Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority."
1.17.16. Pro: A UBI provides the [real freedom](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2265291?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) to pursue the realization of one's conception of the good life.
1.17.16.1. Con: A person who wants to laze on a beach can only be fed by taking from some other source of income. This is not enough to justify a UBI as a way to redistribute revenue.
1.17.16.2. Pro: A UBI can help individuals self-actualize and express themselves creatively. Being able to do so is a basic human right.
1.17.16.2.1. Pro: As set forth in many articles of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), every human being has a right to certain freedoms, including leisure, expression, human dignity, and development of personality. A UBI makes this more obtainable for everyone.
1.17.16.2.2. Pro: The philosophy that guides a UBI is that a life free of poverty is a universal right, not a privilege earned through working.
1.17.16.3. Pro: The adoption of a UBI could help to change the narrative that working full-time is the only way to lead a fulfilling life, which will become important as that becomes increasingly unnecessary and/or inefficient.
1.17.16.3.1. Con: It is false to equivocate acceptance of technological advances with acceptance of a post-work world. As new industries unearth new market needs and generate new wants, new jobs in industries arise to replace those lost to obsolescence.
1.17.16.4. Pro: A UBI allows individuals to make decisions based on their free will VS whether or not they will eat/have shelter.
1.17.16.5. Pro: With a UBI, people will not be forced to settle for a job that only pays the bills, but will be free to explore career paths until they find a meaningful and fulfilling occupation.
1.17.16.5.1. Pro: A UBI gives the individual more freedom. It allows people to decide how to take part in society. There are no strings attached. People can decide whether they want to work or not and they would be urged to do the things they like and that would create happiness.
1.17.16.6. Pro: A UBI would allow people to focus on jobs that they are passionate about rather than simply monetary gain, and thus would improve mental health, job and life satisfaction, self-value and contribution to society.
1.17.16.6.1. Pro: This would also improve their effectiveness and productivity at work, due to increased effort and motivation.
1.17.16.6.2. Pro: An unconditional UBI separates work from income, so that you can do whatever you are best in - and not, what you have to do because somebody is willing to pay for it.
1.17.16.6.3. Con: If everyone does not do the work that's offered but the work they love to do, maybe the resulting work is not financially viable to support the current GDP level \(and thusly through taxes the UBI itself\), e.g., if many people do humanistic work.
1.17.16.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.21.1.4.
1.17.16.8. Pro: Working with an exclusive materialistic intention is sad as it makes humans subject to alienation.
1.17.16.9. Pro: A UBI would give the hardworking person a chance to work for something the person really believes in, rather than being a slave to someone else's project. This leads to a more  satisfied world.
1.17.16.10. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.
1.17.16.11. Pro: Dignity is the cornerstone of personal success and as the world is trending toward AI, a majority of citizens will find themselves without opportunity. GBI guaranteed basic income\) could be the seed of self respect and possibilities.
1.17.16.12. Pro: People who prefer to laze on beaches should not be compelled to work in order to feed themselves. The same goes for people who would opt for a part-time job, or take up volunteering, or start up a new business. A UBI [could provide everyone](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2265291?seq=1&Search=yes&searchText=fed&list=hide&searchUri=%2Fbetasearch%2F%3Facc%3Don%26Query%3Dwhy%2Bsurfers%2Bshould%2Bbe%2Bfed%26fc%3Doff%26wc%3Don&prevSearch=&resultsServiceName=null&loggedin=true#page_scan_tab_contents) with a minimal sum that would support them in living the life they want to live.
1.17.16.12.1. Con: Most people prefer engaging in recreational activities to doing work. However, if all of these people chose not to work, society would not have enough productive labor to function.
1.17.16.12.2. Con: Freedom means choosing a path without being coerced by others, and accepting the consequences of one's actions. People who laze on beaches do not produce anything, yet a UBI would allow them to avoid the natural consequences: not being able to consume.
1.17.16.12.2.1. Con: Not entirely true: they would have less resources to consume than those who choose to engage in labour in order to fund additional consumption. "Lazing on a beach" does not in fact consume resources — it is an economically neutral activity.
1.17.17. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.11.1.25.
1.17.18. Con: Minorities will still be at a socioeconomic disadvantage.
1.17.18.1. Con: Although minorities might remain relatively disadvantaged, their socioeconomic position would definitely improve in absolute terms.
1.17.18.2. Con: If the government's actions are oppressing minorities, then those in power should not be allowed to decide how social spending dollars are allocated. A UBI can only remove decision-making power from any bigots in public office and allocate it to the downtrodden instead. If the structure is oppressive, then removing power from the structure helps the oppressed.
1.17.18.3. Con: If a UBI does not worsen the socioeconomic disadvantages of minorities, this is not a reason not to implement a UBI, as it can lead to other improvements.
1.17.18.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.16.4.3.
