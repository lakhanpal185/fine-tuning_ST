1.4.3. Pro: Internet research may be the only way that young people can find out about topics which affect them, e.g. a child who feels they may be LGBT+ can find information about \(and support for issues with\) sexuality and gender online that their parents or schools may be unwilling to give them.
1.4.4. Pro: Most teachers now set homework assignments which require some level of internet access or use of computer software.

1.6. Pro: The kids will create more meaningful and deep childhood friends and memories.
1.7. Pro: Encouraging outdoor activities can lead to healthier children, and potentially lessen obesity by promoting active play.

If given access to the internet children MAY be exposed to a variety of social skills they would otherwise not encounter from many cultures around the world.
1.9.2. Con: Kids will end up settling with what they have, which may be bad. The internet allows kids to socialize with people like them, rather than someone who will be a bad influence.
