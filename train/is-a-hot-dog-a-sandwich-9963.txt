Discussion Title: Is A Hot Dog A Sandwich?

1. A hot dog is a sandwich
1.1. Con: Sandwiches have two \(or more\) pieces of bread - a hot dog does not.
1.1.1. Con: Sub sandwiches are often made from one piece of bread split, but not detached, the same as a hot dog bun. Therefore, a hot dog can be classified as a sandwich.
1.1.2. Con: There is an entire subset of foods called [Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_sandwich) Sandwiches which do not have 2 pieces of bread but are still considered sandwiches.
1.1.3. Con: The [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sandwich) defines a sandwich as two or more slices of bread, or a split roll having a filling in between, or one slice of bread covered with food.
1.1.4. Pro: It does not matter that the bread is connected as other sandwiches also have connected bread.
1.1.4.1. Con: By this definition, all foods with some edible substance packed inside connected pieces of baked goods, including burritos, hot pockets, or donuts with filling, are all sandwiches.
1.1.4.2. Pro: A hot dog is on a split roll, just like a Lobster Roll, which is always classified as a sandwich.
1.2. Pro: Hot dogs are eaten the same as a sandwich.
1.3. Pro: Bread on both sides and a filling in the middle equals a sandwich.
1.3.1. Pro: If the anecdotal \([www.wyzant.com](https://www.wyzant.com/resources/lessons/english/etymology/words-mod-sandwich)\) history is to be believed, the fourth Earl Of Sandwich "ordered a waiter to bring him roast-beef between two slices of bread...He apparently had the meat put on slices of bread so he wouldnâ€™t get his fingers greasy while he was playing cards". His reasoning was paramount therefore any filling placed between bread which then protects the fingers qualifies.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.4. Con: The official Hot Dog And Sausage [hot-dog.org](http://www.hot-dog.org/culture/hot-dog-sandwich) Council refutes the claim of sandwich-hood.
1.4.1. Pro: The fact that there is a national council for hot dogs but not sandwiches clearly delineates the two as separate forms of foodstuff.
1.4.2. Pro: They classify the hot dog as being part of their [own category](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/11/07/a-hot-dog-is-not-a-sandwich/75362898/).
1.4.3. Con: Hot dogs have been around before the council, therefore the council cannot be the authority on if it is a sandwich.
1.5. Con: Hot dog fans organized petitions and eventually were granted a new hot dog emoji. There was already a sandwich emoji. Why would it be necessary if a hot dog were a sandwich?
1.5.1. Con: Things of a same type have different sub-emojis. There are many varieties of flags and people.
1.6. Pro: Meat only sandwiches are common, and hot dogs can hold many other toppings.
1.7. Con: A hot dog is actually a taco.
1.7.1. Con: A [taco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco) is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled with a meat filling. A hot dog does not fit this description, nor did it originate in Mexico.
1.7.2. Con: A taco is also a sandwich.
