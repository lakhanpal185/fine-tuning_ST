Discussion Title: Scottish Independence: Should Scotland be an Independent Country?

1. Scotland should be an independent country.
1.1. Pro: An independent Scotland can get rid of Trident from it's shores.
1.1.1. Con: This would harm the defense capabilities of the UK and, subsequently, Europe as a whole.
1.1.1.1. Con: Scotland would not be a part of the UK in the scenario given. Trident could be resited in the remaining UK with no impact on defense capabilities for the UK or Europe.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Scotland needn't be separate from the UK to move Trident elsewhere. A significant show of support, such as a mass petition, would prompt the Ministry of Defense to consider relocating the weapons.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Scotland has always been a vital link in British defence, giving coverage of the North Sea. For example, hunting down German warships from Scapa Flow and the Clyde.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: The North Sea is the potential weak link through which continental powers such as Nazi Germany and Russia have seeked to pierce to project into the Atlantic Ocean. British protection of this point is crucial to Euro-American security.
1.1.1.2. Pro: A weaker UK military would have consequences beyond the UK's defense as this military force is used to do global good.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: The Iraq War of 2003 was highly unpopular and yet still went ahead.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: There wasn't a means of direct democratic accountability on the declaration of war.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: The British public, including Scotland, voted in favour of Tony Blair's government despite the Iraq War.
1.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: One of the biggest protests in British history occurred in opposition to the Iraq War.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: The proposed invasion of Syria in 2013 was defeated in Parliament.
1.1.2. Con: This would be hypocritical since Scotland will accept nuclear protection under NATO. Other nations provide the weaponry that protects Scotland. Scotland is less of a target but those nations are even more of a target.
1.1.3. Pro: With no nuclear capabilities Scotland would present less of a target in the event of war.
1.1.3.1. Pro: With being less of a target, a cheaper Scottish defence force is justified.
1.2. Pro: Scotland is capable of managing it's own affairs.
1.2.1. Con: Smaller countries, by virtue of their size, necessarily draw on a smaller pool of talent at each level of government and are consequently less able than larger states to run themselves effwctively.
1.2.2. Pro: Scotland has had [a parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament) for almost two decades that has managed most of the country's domestic affairs.
1.2.2.1. Con: Hence independence is an unnecessary move that would incur costs, uncertainty and strife.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Hence Independence is necessary to allow change for the betterment of Scotland's people without the requiring permission any other nation.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Scotland's devolved government is limited by the powers they have been 'given' by the UK Government.
1.3. Con: Scotland is economically in a bad spot and would only exacerbate its problems without the UK.
1.3.1. Con: This refers to figures for Scotland within the UK and is no guide to the finances of an Independent Scotland.
1.3.1.1. Pro: A Scotland outside the UK would be faced with significant uncertainty.
1.3.2. Con: Scotland's underlying resources would still exist \(capital, land, labour\).
1.3.3. Con: Scotland has a rich and diverse economy and is well capable of supporting itself.
1.3.3.1. Con: Just as a single person could live on hardly anything. It's not desirable, however, compared to the much better living standards one can achieve by working together.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Scotland could cooperate with other countries if it were to become independent.
1.3.3.2. Con: Just as the Republic of Ireland, an independent Scotland would be in danger of becoming a tax haven in order to attract investment.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: Ireland has that right to choose for itself.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: This isn't what's in dispute. It's that tax havens have a negative impact on a community's ability to pay for public services, as well as on other communities.
1.3.3.3. Pro: "An Independent Scotland could expect to start with healthier state finances than the rest of the UK" \([Financial Times February](https://www.ft.com/content/5b5ec2ca-8a67-11e3-ba54-00144feab7de)\).
1.3.3.3.1. Con: The Scottish government estimated it would have run [a 9.5% deficit](https://www.ft.com/content/7c6f8ca8-0807-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b) in 2016-2017 compared to the UK national deficit of 3.8%.
1.3.4. Pro: The UK subsidises Scotland.
1.3.4.1. Con: This does not necessarily imply that Scotland is economically in a bad spot. It might simply have made a beneficial deal with the UK about spending, regardless of how well-off Scotland is.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Scotland accounts for [8.2%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#Population) of the UK's population and 8.0% of its income, yet it accounts for 9.2% of the public spending \([House of Commons, p. 3](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06625/SN06625.pdf)\).
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Scotland is the [least densely populated country in the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_of_the_United_Kingdom_by_population) and therefore provision of everyday services cost more as a result.
1.3.5. Pro: Scotland's economic growth in 2017 was virtually non-existent at [around 0.1 or 0.2%](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-41498343)
1.4. Con: A [majority](http://whatscotlandthinks.org/questions/how-would-you-vote-in-the-in-a-scottish-independence-referendum-if-held-now-ask#line) of Scottish citizens continue to oppose this step.
1.4.1. Con: This may be a statement of fact depending on current opinion polls but it is not an argument for either change or the status quo.
1.5. Con: A Scotland outside the UK would still not be independent as it might become a member of the EU.
1.5.1. Con: We are currently in the EU. If this statement were true, sovereignty would currently lie with the EU, and not Westminster.
1.5.1.1. Con: Sovereignty is not a single block, itâ€™s splintered under any political system. For example there is no Scottish or UK sovereignty over fishing, or \(were we to rejoin\) over VAT on kids clothes and basic food. The issue therefore is why does the nationalist case for democracy for Scotland suddenly stop at these issues?
1.5.2. Pro: The trend of British government is to devolve power closer to people whereas the EU's trend is the concentration of power. The latter is more authoritarian therefore.
1.6. Con: The bureaucracy and uncertainty surrounding Brexit shows just how fraught with problems exiting a union one is intrinsically linked to is.
1.6.1. Con: On the other hand, the fraught nature of Brexit surely has more to do with its incompetent handling and the complexities in the exit of four nations with differing aspirations not to mention the exceptional level of division within the fractured governing party, the Conservatives. Those conditions would have no valid application to Scotland.
1.6.2. Pro: The dissolution of many unions has been relatively simple. In the Czecoslovakian creation of Slovakia and The Czech Republic the problems with the Euro split between four nations in the UK and the twenty or so in the EU had no parallel.
1.7. Con: An independent Scotland would probably also be outside the European Union.
1.7.1. Pro: Doubts about whether an independent Scotland would remain a EU member have been voices, for example, by former EU Commission President [Barroso](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/independent-scotland-eu-member-snp).
1.7.2. Con: This prospect is hardly problematic as Scotland. As part of the United Kingdom it is on its way out of the EU anyway.
1.7.2.1. Con: Scotland would therefore be cast out of both the EU and the UK.
1.7.3. Con: If the will of the Scottish people were that they wanted to remain, that would constitute no great problem. Scotland already is a member and complies with all European laws and regulations.
1.7.3.1. Con: Scotland would not have its own central bank, a requirement to either transition to the Euro or launch its own currency, as a formal credit union is very unlikely. While it could make its own central bank, this would take time and capital that Scotland does not have.
1.7.3.2. Con: The UK is a member \(until it leaves\); Scotland is a member by virtue of the UK. An independent Scotland would have to [reapply](https://www.politico.eu/article/independent-scotland-would-have-to-apply-to-join-eu/) for [membership](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-membership-spain-scotland/) to the EU.
1.7.3.3. Con: Scotland [does not meet](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/08/25/scotlands-budget-deficit-the-largest-in-europe-couldnt-join-the-eu-if-it-wanted-to/) EU budgetary requirements. The EU likes members to run at most at a 3% deficit of GDP. Scotland runs at [9.5% deficit](https://www.taxpayersalliance.com/scottish_deficit_is_twice_that_of_the_uk_and_higher_than_greece), comfortably more than [Greece's at 7.5%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2017/02/20/an-independent-scotland-would-be-bust-and-face-a-greek-style-depression/) and 7.1% over the EU average of 2.4%.It is unlikely the EU would admit someone that would essentially immediately need a bail out and the same or greater austerity measures as [Greece](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3835447/Scotland-s-bigger-economic-basket-case-Greece.html).
1.7.3.3.1. Con: The EU could [choose to waiver](https://discourse.scot/2017/02/26/scotlands-deficit-and-joining-the-eu/) these rules as they are applied flexibility, as was the case with Croatia in 2013, when it ran at 5.3%. Admittedly, this is not as high as Scotland's deficit and may be cause for pause.
1.8. Con: Scotland and Britain have a long, shared history.
1.8.1. Con: Tradition is not an argument against change.
1.8.1.1. Con: Tradition is received knowledge from our ancestors and is vital, according to Durkheim, to maintaining social solidarity or else society falls apart.
1.8.2. Con: Scotland has a rich and diverse history of its own.
1.8.3. Pro: Scotland fought against Nazism as part of Britain. This heritage is something to be proud of.
1.8.4. Pro: Scotland and England were united initially by a Scottish king: James VI, bringing the two countries together and putting an end to centuries of internecine conflict.
1.8.5. Pro: Westminster is one of the oldest democratic institutions in the world. To leave it would be to throw away 300 years of history.
1.8.5.1. Con: Often its good to overcome history.
1.8.6. Con: This history will continue regardless of whether Scotland is independent or not.
1.8.7. Pro: The biggest political party in the UK by membership \(the Labour Party\) was founded by a Scotsman, Keir Hardie.
1.8.7.1. Con: Keir Hardie supported Home Rule. Labour have had the opportunity to deliver Home Rule on several occasions and didn't.
1.8.7.1.1. Con: Apart from when they did.
\([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_Act_1998)\)
1.9. Con: Scotland leaving the UK would undermine the UK as a whole.
1.9.1. Con: This is not a reason to stay. Independence for the Scots should be due to what is best for the people of Scotland. This is only a valid argument if the UK being undermined would have a detrimental impact on an independent Scotland.
1.10. Con: As part of Britain, Scotland has representation in the G8 and the UN Security Council.
1.11. Pro: Scotland voted to stay in the European Union \([62%](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36599102) over all and every council region\) but is being pulled out by the more numerous English voters. This is undemocratic.
1.11.1. Con: Scotland voted on whether the UK should stay in the EU, not on whether Scotland alone should. The answer to one question cannot necessarily be used to answer the other.
1.11.2. Con: Scotland voted for the UK to stay in the EU, not for Scotland alone to remain part of the EU.
1.11.3. Con: Choosing democratically leads always to unfair situation. In any democratic process, the minority will be forced to accept the final decision.
1.12. Pro: Scotland is a country. The natural state for a country is independence.
1.12.1. Con: Scotland is a nation, not a country in its own right, and there is nothing unnatural for multiple nations to exist within one state.
1.12.2. Con: There is nothing natural about countries. They are artificial.
1.12.3. Con: For most of human history, people have existed under empires. Many of whom we would consider countries now weren't independent typically \(for example Ukraine\), hence independence is not a 'natural' state.
1.12.3.1. Con: Most empires were the result of invasions. More recently, countries have become independent of the rule of the empire-builders. Why should this be denied Scotland uniquely?
1.12.4. Con: 'Country' in the sense of the regions of the UK [isn't the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country#Sovereignty_status) as 'country' in the sense of 'sovereign nation-state'.
1.12.5. Con: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a 'country' in the sense of a sovereign state. It is independent. Scotland is part of the UK, therefore it's independent.
1.13. Pro: The current political arrangement with the UK is unfair and undemocratic for Scotland.
1.13.1. Con: Since the devolution process, British MPs in London can no longer vote on [key issues](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/higher/modern/uk_gov_politics/gov_sco/revision/1/) in Scotland, for example health, education and most aspects of law.
1.13.2. Pro: In a variety of [important areas](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/higher/modern/uk_gov_politics/gov_sco/revision/1/) of Scottish governance, decisions are made in Westminster by people not representing Scottish citizens. Among them are constitutional affairs, immigration and defense policy.
1.13.2.1. Con: The people of Scotland voted in favor of maintaining the union with the UK, thereby expressing that they are fine with leaving these issues reserved for the union level.
1.13.3. Con: Westminster facilitated devolution to respect Scotland's wishes.
1.13.3.1. Con: It had to. In the face of European expansion and accession of eastern European countries, the EU could not be seen to expound the benefits of greater democracy while it had a democratic anomaly amongst its members. Devolution was the cost of European eastward expansion.
1.13.4. Con: Scotland's MPs have the equal rights and responsibilities as other British MPs.
1.13.5. Con: Scotland is a core part of Britain. It is an equal partner and has provided half of the previous four Prime Ministers.
1.13.6. Con: Candidates from pro-Union parties: the Conservative Party, Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, obtained the majority of the votes cast by the Scottish people in the 2017 election.
1.13.7. Con: British democracy has allowed the freedom of expression including but not limited to advocacy of Scottish autonomy, independence and the Scottish National Party.
1.13.7.1. Pro: The UK Government facilitated the 2014 referendum on Scottish Independence. Compare with Catalonia and the Spanish Government.
1.13.8. Con: British democracy has shown time and time again the ability to reform and enhance its democracy.
1.13.8.1. Con: Britain has a first past the post system and an unelected House of Lords.
1.13.8.1.1. Con: The House of Lords has had its power limited in favour of the House of Commons since 1911.
1.13.8.1.2. Con: In 1999, the House of Lords was reformed to cut down on the number of hereditary peers.
1.13.8.1.3. Pro: Since 1999, the political will to reform the House of Lords has been low in favour of dealing with other issues.
1.13.8.1.4. Pro: Britain has an unelected, hereditary monarch.
1.13.8.2. Pro: In 1928, it enacted equal voting rights for men and women.
1.13.8.3. Pro: In 1918, it introduced votes for \(some\) women.
