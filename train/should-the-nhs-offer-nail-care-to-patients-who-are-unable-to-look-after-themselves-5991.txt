Discussion Title: Should the NHS offer nail care to patients who are unable to look after themselves?

1. Should the National Health Service \(UK\) offer nail care to patients who are unable to look after themselves?
1.1. Pro: Unkempt nails can be a detriment to one's health. The NHS should help prevent this in patience that cannot do so themselves.
1.1.1. Con: Nail care is no immediate threat to a person's health.
1.1.2. Pro: Nails that grow long and dig into the skin can cause infection, which in [high risk groups](https://www.podiatrytoday.com/how-routine-nail-care-can-prevent-complications-patients-diabetes) can lead to limb loss, which in turn can lead to premature death.
1.2. Pro: If someone is unwell they should be able to depend on the NHS to look after them.
1.3. Pro: People in the UK pay taxes so they should expect to receive NHS health care for all of their health needs.
1.4. Con: NHS spending is out of control.
1.4.1. Pro: The NHS is spending [10 times](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38887694) the amount it spent on health care 60 years ago, after its adjusted for inflation.
1.5. Con: The risk associated with not providing nail care is too small to make it worth the NHS supporting.
1.6. Con: Podiatry staff are overqualified for this task.
1.6.1. Pro: This is bad use and management of podiatry appointments.
