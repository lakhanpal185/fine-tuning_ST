Discussion Title: Joint custody for children after divorce. Yes or no?

1. Joint custody for children after divorce. Yes or no?
1.1. Pro: Children experience less stress than non-custody children.
1.1.1. Pro: In [Sweden](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10502556.2017.1325648?src=recsys&journalCode=wjdr20&), children in shared physical custody report lower levels of stress.
1.2. Con: Whether or not joint custody should be installed and enforced is subjective- particular to each case, not decidable in the general sense.
1.2.1. Con: Joint custody should not be enforced at all - it leaves a significant damage on the children.
1.2.1.1. Con: The child may suffer more by feeling abandoned by one parent
1.3. Pro: It is not perfect option, but still it's the best we have.
1.3.1. Con: When the parents continue with fighting each other, it is really bad for the children. The divorce is never over.
1.3.1.1. Con: They shold share the coustody if the divorce is settled peacefully
1.3.2. Pro: When the parents are cooperating, it could really improve childrens well-being \(if compared to the situation before divorce\).
1.4. Pro: Children success is better when both parents \(step-parent or not\) are active and have good positive vibes when raising their child.
1.5. Con: It can damage the children further more than the divorce itself.
1.5.1. Pro: One or both parents may be unfriendly and unable to compromise.
1.5.2. Pro: If one parent was abusive, the child may be subjected to further abuse.
1.5.2.1. Con: Some cases sould not set the rule for everyone
1.5.3. Con: Having continued access to both parents may make the experience of divorce less traumatic for the child by reducing the disruption to their life.
1.5.4. Con: Thats only if one of the parents are bitter, evil, and greedy during the divorce and does everything they can to make the other one suffer.
1.6. Pro: Child can be in touch with both parents equally.
1.6.1. Con: Sometimes one parent is abusive or a destructive influence on a child, and it is unhealthy for the child to have equal contact with that parent.
1.6.1.1. Pro: If a parent is abusive or so, there should not be any contact at all.
1.7. Con: Children can easily discover many ways for manipulating their parents through the joint custody.
1.7.1. Pro: Children with behavioural issues may threaten to move in with the other parent in joint custody arrangements in order to get what they want.
1.7.1.1. Con: If there is a cooperation and/or good relationship between the parents, these manipulation do not work.
1.8. Con: The mother is more important for children.
1.8.1. Con: This is irrelevant if both parents are mothers.
1.8.2. Pro: Studies [have shown](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/dec/03/childs-cognitive-skills-linked-time-with-mother) that time spent with the mother is an important predictor of a child's cognitive development.
1.8.2.1. Con: Studies has also shown that father's influence and good relationship in teen age could decrease risk behaviour of children.
1.8.3. Con: Many [have argued](https://theconversation.com/do-mothers-really-have-stronger-bonds-with-their-children-than-fathers-do-57590) that fathers develop bonds with their children which are just as important as those of the mother.
1.8.4. Con: [Some studies](https://ifstudies.org/blog/five-facts-about-todays-single-fathers) show that children in single-father families fare about as well as children in single-mother families on many outcomes.
1.9. Pro: Less problems with aliments and other financy.
