Discussion Title: Time for a Maximum Wage? Should the US Limit CEO Pay?

1. US companies should be prohibited from paying any employee more than 35 times the compensation of their lowest-paid employee.
1.1. Con: The existence of highly paid, wealthy executives is beneficial to society.
1.1.1. Pro: High paid business leaders often start or invest in new companies which fill some large need or want that the society has.  As one example, Elon Musk would not have had 10 million to invest in safe AI research if his lowest paid employee would have then needed at least a $285,715.00 salary.  Comparable arguments could be made for Tesla Motors, Space X, Solar City, and the rest of his companies and investments.
1.1.1.1. Con: There's a difference between entrepreneur founder/CEOs like Musk and non-founder CEOs, who attain their wealth without the risk borne by founder CEOs.
1.1.1.2. Con: Elon Musk, like most wealthy entrepreneurs, made his fortune primarily through [sales of equity](http://time.com/money/4883868/8-innovative-ways-elon-musk-made-money-before-he-was-a-billionaire/), not pay.
1.1.2. Pro: Reducing executive pay would result in a loss of tax revenue.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Since higher brackets of income are taxed at increasingly high rates, every marginal dollar of high income is comparatively more valuable to the government.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: A salary cap as proposed here would primarily hit those with an income of over $250.000 per year. [This group](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/13/high-income-americans-pay-most-income-taxes-but-enough-to-be-fair/) currently includes only about 3% of tax payers yet accounts for more than half of all income tax paid - which equals [about a quarter](http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-where-do-federal-tax-revenues-come-from) of all federal government revenue.
1.1.2.2. Con: It is possible that companies will instead raise wages across the board in order to prop up CEO pay, meaning both more tax revenue from people with now higher wages, as well as maintaining the current \(or close to\) level of tax collection.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: This policy necessitates an across the board pay increase in order to facilitate an increase in executive pay. For most firms, this would be far more expensive than just increasing the pay of executives. This means that it would be much less likely to be backed by the board or shareholders.
1.1.2.3. Pro: The government could avoid the loss of revenue and [still combat inequality](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/10/jeremy-corbyn-maximum-pay-panel) by heavily taxing CEOs and top earners through re-distributive progressive taxation, thereby reducing inequality while increasing revenue.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Increasing progressive tax rates would reduce income inequality.
1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Using the tax system to exert downward pressure on CEO pay has proven ineffective.
1.1.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: In 1993, Congress capped the corporate tax deduction for senior managers' pay at $1 million, but companies merely [deferred](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/03/03/uncapping-executive-pay/) payment until the executives retired.
1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: Increasing progressive tax rates would reduce inequality while being less disruptive to business, because the government would be working within an existing and well-understood framework \(taxation\) rather than creating an unprecedented new type of regulation.
1.1.2.3.1.3. Pro: Some academics have [proposed](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/business/better-insurance-against-inequality.html?ref=business) indexing tax rates for inequality such that tax rates would become more progressive as inequality increased, ensuring that the super-rich would bear a greater tax burden, while also alleviating the burden on the less wealthy.
1.1.2.4. Con: Given that part of the purpose of tax revenue is to enable the government to provide services, raising wages for people, especially at the bottom, reduces the demand for those services and thus the money needed to fund them.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Spending on safety net programs for low income individuals and families currently accounts for [about 10%](http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go) of the federal budget.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: Companies like Walmart pay their employees so little that many of them qualify for food stamps, Medicaid and other taxpayer-funded assistance programs. For Walmart alone, higher wages would [save the government billions](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/files/Taxpayers-and-Walmart-ATF1.pdf).
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: If enforcement were by taxing income in excess of the cap at 100%, then companies would be forced into a choice: pay their upper management excessively, volunteering that money to be taxed; raise lower-level employee wages or reduce product costs, both freeing up more money for more people to spend on their own other needs; or invest that money into other services, which will likely include public service at various places throughout the economy.
1.1.2.4.3.1. Con: A fifth option companies might choose is to hang onto all that surplus money in the name of the company rather than any individual, as a nest egg for fines, allowing them greater leeway to ignore regulations of any sort.
1.1.2.5. Con: As the CEO of a company; they have several other "non-income" methods for receiving funds from their company, such as dividends. They can also spend funds on company assets that remain under their control keeping them "under" the 35x cap \( such as company boats, company mansions, etc.\).
1.1.2.6. Pro: By sub contracting menial labour companies relieve themselves of the duty ["of having to pay a full-time salary"](http://www.hcr-llc.com/blog/7-reasons-why-subcontracting-may-be-right-for-you). This leaves the worker without a dependable income, and avoids paying fair taxes.
1.1.2.6.1. Con: In some instances, the use of sub-contracting costs more than employing labour. The contractor must be paid, and the workers are less used to the specific circumstances of the company making them less effective. If the CEO sub-contracts in their own self-interest in these cases, this will act against the company's interests.
1.1.2.6.2. Con: These salary caps could just be written into law such that the lowest paid employee is defined to include contracted workers.
1.1.2.6.3. Pro: The [Fair Labor Standards Act](http://Fair Labor Standards Act) which [establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, record keeping and child labor standards](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/subcontracting-labor-law-75734.html)  applies only to employees. This means that those hired by contractors for specific jobs do not get the same protections.
1.1.2.6.3.1. Pro: Although [legislative protection](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41230.pdf) does exist, such as a requirement to[pay promptly for services given](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41230.pdf), the fact that sub contractors work for so many employees makes it impossible to identify which one owes an employer's duty to them.
1.1.2.6.3.1.1. Pro: This means that it is unlikely that sub contractors could ever be given the same legal protections as regular employees are now. Thus, pushing employees to use sub contracted labour necessarily means that those now working will get less protection.
1.1.2.6.4. Pro: Subcontractors, like janitorial services companies for example, are much more likely to employ their workers on the basis of client demand which requires that contracts that have flexible hours and do not promise a given number of hours each week.These contracts tend to be abusive.
1.1.2.6.4.1. Pro: These kinds of contracts can include abusive "[at-will contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-will_employment)" or "[zero-hour contracts](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-23573442)" which make both pay and hours extremely inconsistent and destroy financial security for entry-level workers.
1.1.2.6.4.2. Pro: Flexible hours tend to require voluntary or involuntary on-demand work, where an employer can call an employee at any time of day and ask that they work. This sort of work puts chronic stress on individuals who never know when they might get a call.
1.1.2.6.4.3. Con: These contracts allow domestic workers to be more competitive and helps prevent outsourcing, lay-offs, and automation.
1.1.2.6.4.4. Pro: These contracts coerce workers into accepting unethical working conditions because employees fear speaking out when their employment \(or number of hours of work\) can be terminated or cut down at any time.
1.1.2.6.4.5. Pro: These sorts of contracts increase inequality because workers are unlikely to spend money on fixed cost commodities \(ie an education or mortgage\) - which are especially important at increasing social mobility - when these individuals are unsure of how much work they will get in any given week.
1.1.2.6.4.5.1. Con: However, these contracts are often chosen by workers who  need a flexible work arrangement, such as college students, to help meet the costs of their education.
1.1.2.6.4.5.2. Pro: A decrease in spending by low-income individuals is also likely to hurt the economy which is reliant on steady consumption.
1.1.2.6.4.6. Pro: Contracts which allow for flexible hours allow for companies to hire many more workers than they actually need and then give each of them relatively few hours. This allows these companies to avoid providing certain rights or protections, such as notice before firing or healthcare, that are afforded on the basis of how many hours individuals work.
1.1.2.6.4.7. Con: Subcontractors and the contracts they use allow the economy to be more flexible. During Christmas, for instance, individuals can work at Macy's when they have far more consumer demand, then move to another job after the season is over. This maximizes efficiency and worker pay.
1.1.2.7. Pro: When Switzerland was debating the introduction of a 12:1 salary cap, this policy was forecast to lead to major financial losses.
1.1.2.7.1. Pro: A study estimated that, even if the salaries cut at the top are paid to other workers, the country would lose 0.5 to 1 Billion Francs in tax revenue. Additionally, up to a billion could be lost in social security contributions. Under all scenarios the bottom line would be negative \([Keuschnigg at al., p. 8-10](http://www.swiss-economics.ch/RePEc/files/S0009SGV.pdf)\).
1.1.2.7.1.1. Pro: These losses would be even larger under the assumption that some companies and workers would leave the country. The annual losses in tax revenue and social security payments could then exceed 2-3 Billion \([Keuschnigg at al., p. 8-10](http://www.sgv-usam.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/1_zu_12/de/20130910_mk-studie/20130910_mk-1zu12-studie_studie-lang_de.pdf)\).
1.1.2.8. Con: Excessively compensated employees "continue, however, to deduct the [majority of their executive compensation](http://www.epi.org/publication/taxes-executive-compensation/), with these deductions costing the U.S. Treasury an estimated $7.5 billion per year."
1.1.3. Pro: High paid business leaders often utilize their wealth for philanthropic efforts.
1.1.3.1. Con: In the US, individuals with high income [give a smaller share](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/04/why-the-rich-dont-give/309254/) of their incomes to charity than do those with low income. The middle class is the [most generous](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/America-s-Generosity-Divide/156175). Less income inequality might therefore lead to more charitable contributions.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: Nevertheless, the total sum of charitable contributions might be much lower without the mega-donations of rich people.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: There is little use considering a scenario that is technically possible, but does not align with prevailing relevant theories, nor match with previous data.
1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The average propensity to save is positively correlated with income, as people earn more, they save a higher amount of their income.
1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Together, the top 50 American donors gave [$5.6 Billion in 2016](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Phil-Knight-Tops-Chronicle-s/239122) and even $10.2 Billion in 2014 for philanthropic purposes.
1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: These individuals alone gave [about 1.4%](https://givingusa.org/see-the-numbers-giving-usa-2017-infographic/) of the total charitable contributions that Americans made in 2016.
1.1.3.1.1.2.2. Con: These select super-rich individuals are not necessarily representative for Americans who would be affected by a salary cap as a whole.
1.1.3.2. Con: Psychological studies [indicate that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20649364) individuals of low socio-economic status are more prosocial than those of high social class as they face more risks and have more interest in egalitarian values and compassion.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: [Other research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19121143) corroborates this by showing a link between social power and lower distress as well as compassion in the face of other individuals' suffering.
1.1.3.3. Con: The money that rich people give does not necessarily go to public causes and, especially, those in need.
1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Of the [50 largest charitable gifts](https://www.philanthropy.com/factfile/gifts/1?DonorDisplayName_cu=&Category=any&GiftRecipients_RecipOrgDateline_c=&GiftRecipients_RecipStateFull=any&GiftDonors_SourceWealth_cu=&GiftDonors_aStateFull=any&GiftYear=2016) made in the US in 2016, only a single one went to an organization primarily dedicated to social services, and none to organizations that primarily serve education or children and youths in general.
1.1.3.3.2. Pro: [Almost 60%](https://www.philanthropy.com/factfile/gifts/1?DonorDisplayName_cu=&Category=Colleges+and+universities&GiftRecipients_RecipOrgDateline_c=&GiftRecipients_RecipStateFull=any&GiftDonors_SourceWealth_cu=&GiftDonors_aStateFull=any&GiftYear=2016) of the 50 largest charitable gifts made in the US in 2016 went to specific colleges and universities, thus helping many who are already in a good position and even promoting the reproduction of existing elites and rich institutions.
1.1.3.3.3. Con: This is not bad because it allows investment in things which are underappreciated. [The SETI program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence), for instance, would not exist if not for massive donations by a Russian oligarch.
1.1.3.3.3.1. Con: It should not be a luxury of a small segment of society to determine what things are under-appreciated and benefit from funding while other areas \(including those necessary for basic needs such as education and healthcare\) go underfunded.
1.1.3.4. Con: High paid business leaders often make a show of utilizing their wealth for philanthropic efforts, the amount is often over-inflated, and many times that money isn't being as generously given as it might at first seem.
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Many 'generous donations' come with [strings attached](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/your-money/wealth-matters-philanthropy-david-callahan.html?_r=0), such as giving the donor media attention or recognition for the contribution, or allowing the donor to retain control of the expenditure, regardless of whether their spending preferences greatly limits, or even nullifies, the impact of their donation.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Mark Zuckerberg gave 100 million dollars to education, but after money spent on consultants and related expenses, very little money actually reached the [intended recipients](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/your-money/wealth-matters-philanthropy-david-callahan.html?_r=0), the under-educated children.
1.1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.2.
1.1.3.6. Pro: Often, certain philanthropic efforts require enormous sums of money to get off the ground. High paid executives can provide this level of capital necessary to achieve success.
1.1.3.6.1. Pro: Few individuals or even philanthropic organizations could finance a university on their own, as George Soros has done with the Central European University in Hungary. It has an endowment by him of [around $800 Million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_University).
1.1.3.6.2. Pro: Research Institutes that would otherwise be hard to establish are often propelled by donations of rich individuals, for example the [Huntsman Cancer Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsman_Cancer_Institute) which has received more than $250 Million by Jon Huntsman Sr.
1.1.3.7. Con: High earners may give a larger amount to charity, but lower earners give a higher percentage of their income to charity, meaning that the [proportion of charitable funding](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/04/why-the-rich-dont-give/309254/) given by high earners is actually lower than their lower earning counterparts.
1.1.3.8. Pro: High earners have more disposable income that they can, and often do, give to charity. This makes the [amount given to charity](https://www.salon.com/2016/12/27/does-being-wealthy-make-you-more-charitable_partner/) by high earners larger than what is given by lower earners.
1.1.3.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.7.
1.1.4. Pro: The prospect of becoming a wealthy executive fuels the American dream and the aspirations of individuals.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The opportunity for promotion and job mobility within a company means that a large pay disparity may act as incentive to workers, as they perceive it as achievable to them.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Specialisation within a  company means that most employees will never have an opportunity for significant promotion. The staff involved in menial labour are unlikely to be promoted to the role of CEO.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Research indicates that forty-eight percent of appointments of managerial positions result from reorganisation within a company. This demonstrates that a degree of mobility does exist with in companies \([Ruderman/Ohlott, p. 7](http://www.ccl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RealitiesMgtPromotion.pdf)\).
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: Since career advancement is a [significant motivator](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2014/01/24/want-motivated-employees-offer-ample-opportunities-for-growth/#174ddcd352c6) for employees, there is a strong incentive for companies to allow some form of mobility in the workplace.
1.1.4.1.4. Con: Whilst this is true, a situation where a CEO is paid twenty times, rather than forty times, what the average worker is paid would surely provide enough of a disparity to present an incentive to workers.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Compressing the compensation gap between each management layer within a company will not increase motivation. People are more motivated to work and compete harder if they know the next level up offers a big salary jump.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: There are [numerous](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/29/this-boss-set-a-70000-minimum-wage-for-his-employees-3-years-ago.html) [case studies](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201511/paul-keegan/does-more-pay-mean-more-growth.html) that show that when employee pay increases \(especially that of the lowest paid workers\) the value to the company exceeds the expense of increased wages.
1.1.4.3. Pro: If low skill workers are highly compensated, high skill employees may find their compensation is not commensurate with their skill and experience. They may choose to quit and work in easier jobs for the same pay.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: Companies often leave [pay gaps](http://www.workplaceanswers.com/resources/blog/minimum-wage-affects-employees-pay/) between employee rankings to avoid devaluing the employment of more greatly skilled or experienced workers. Under a salary cap, the lowest paid worker will still be paid less than employees on higher rungs of the corporate ladder, however the greatest disparity in salary will be constrained within the 35:1 ratio.
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: If the difference in pay is reduced, less people will be willing to commit to the increased hours, pressure and risk associated with working as a CEO.
1.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: [geolib.com](http://geolib.com/smith.adam/won1-10.html) Here is the section of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations that addresses how the price of labor is set. Paragraph 24 is a good place to start. Here he explains that those who take on large risks of failure are compensated at a higher rate to compensate for the risk. Furthermore, he describes why those who must be trusted to a greater degree in an occupation earn more. Both of these are true of a CEO.
1.1.4.3.2.2. Pro: High executive pay attracts high quality executives.
1.1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: CEO's and other high level leaders are paid large salaries as they shoulder the burden of the companies success. If the company fails, the CEO gets blamed, not the lowest level assistant. If leadership can only make a certain amount without raising wages company wide, their incentive to create a growing and successful business goes way down, affecting everyone.
1.1.4.3.2.2.1.1. Con: In practice, CEOs are not held responsible for their failures.
1.1.4.3.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: While the investment banks they ran crashed and collapsed, the top executives of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns made more than a billion dollars in the preceding years and left with a profit. This divergence has been linked to incentive structures that reward excessive risk taking \([Bebchuk et al.](http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/bebchuk/pdfs/BCS-Wages-of-Failure-Nov09.pdf)\).
1.1.4.3.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Marissa Mayer, the chief executive of Yahoo, presided over the company's steady decline and absorption by Verizon but made [about 239 Million Dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/technology/yahoo-marissa-mayer-compensation.html) over five years, chiefly because the company's financial worth increased and shareholders profited.
1.1.4.3.2.2.2. Con: Even if companies suffer from a salary cap, society as a whole might profit. If executive positions at companies become less attractive, more highly-qualified individuals might choose other areas for work, for example politics or the public sector.
1.1.4.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Many graduates of top-schools like Harvard, Princeton and Yale usually [end up](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/out-of-harvard-and-into-finance/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0) in high-paying industries like finance and consulting; few enter government service.
1.1.4.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: With the exception of the President, the country's highest public representatives receive a compensation of  [$174,000 per year](https://www.senate.gov/CRSpubs/9c14ec69-c4e4-4bd8-8953-f73daa1640e4.pdf). This is less than [all but three](http://graphics.wsj.com/ceo-salary-vs-company-performance/) CEOs of S&P 500 companies, two of which receive a symbolic salary of only $1. The fourth-lowest paid of these CEOs receives about three times as much as the politicians. This makes high political offices unattractive in comparison.
1.1.4.3.2.2.2.2.1. Con: It is questionable whether it benefits the political process if individuals become politicians because of an attractive salary.
1.1.4.3.2.2.2.2.2. Con: However, with high political office there are many perks that continue after the conclusion of their terms. This includes accomodation, security details, private drivers and free flights.
1.1.4.3.2.2.2.2.3. Con: Political office also enables former presidents the opportunity to earn money as guest speakers at functions for a [fee](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/01/barack-obama-speaking-fees-economic-racial-justice).
1.1.4.3.2.2.3. Con: High pay fails to secure and retain high quality executives, as CEO turnover continues to rise even as compensation increases.
1.1.4.3.2.2.3.1. Con: The increase in CEO turnover may instead be attributed to companies becoming more skilled at identifying when CEOs do not perform to sufficient standards. Whereas before CEOs remained in the one company for long periods, such CEOs are now [dismissed](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/business/economy/04view.html) and replaced with an alternative candidate.
1.1.4.3.2.2.3.1.1. Con: This misses the point that CEOs are not improving in performance, generally.
1.1.4.3.2.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: Additional money, as an incentive, has a [negative effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc) on work that requires a high level of cognitive thinking. CEO work requires a high level of cognitive thinking.
1.1.4.3.2.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: The performance of executives barely determines their pay; what provides a much better indicator for executives' pay is the size of companies \([Tosi et al, p. 329](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/014920630002600207)\).
1.1.4.3.2.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: The pay of British executives saw a rise of 82% over the course of 13 years, yet this stood in no relation to the added value generated in the form of return on invested capital, as [one study](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/27/negligible-link-between-executive-pay-and-firms-performance-says-study) argues.
1.1.4.3.2.2.3.1.1.4. Pro: Executives often receive large payouts when they leave the company. These payouts are usually not performance based.
1.1.4.3.2.2.3.1.1.5. Pro: Executives often receive performance bonuses during times when a company is struggling.
1.1.4.3.2.2.3.2. Pro: Even if a high salary initially attracts a good executive, it is a unnecessary and wasted investment if the executive does not stay with the company for more than a few years.
1.1.4.3.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: Following the departure of a CEO, the company's stock price becomes [volatile](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr166.pdf) as the company's strategic future is uncertain.
1.1.4.3.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: Companies necessarily [lose](https://hbr.org/1996/05/the-ways-chief-executive-officers-lead) some sense of identity when a CEO leaves, resulting in decreased unity and cultural cohesion.
1.1.4.3.2.2.3.3. Pro: [Nearly 1/5 of CEOs](http://press.pwc.com/News-releases/ceo-turnover-at-a-record-high-globally--with-more-companies-planning-for-new-chiefs-from-outside-the/s/f37f4811-8fca-4b21-ae8b-2e11c3c10561) were replaced in 2015, a record high since 2000.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4. Pro: Attracting good senior-level employees is critical to a company's performance.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1. Con: [High pay](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/high-executive-pay-performance-ceos-link-negligible-study-a7498441.html) does not result in [high performance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2014/06/16/the-highest-paid-ceos-are-the-worst-performers-new-study-says/#6e0447927e32).
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.3.1.1.4.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.3.1.1.5.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.3. Pro: Many foreign executives are paid far less than their American counterparts to run companies which, at the very least, perform just as well as their American counterparts.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: The head of Ford Motors at one point recently made more than the heads of Toyota, Honda and Nissan [combined](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/money/worth-ford-ceo-heads-toyota-honda-nissan-combined-article-1.180964), despite being outperformed.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.3.2. Con: In many other countries, CEOs face more restrictions - for examples through corporate board structures and business culture - on their actions and have therefore less influence on a company's performance. CEOs in the US have more influence and responsibility and, thus, are paid better \([Crossland/Hambrick, p. 767](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.610/abstract)\).
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.3.3. Con: This does not prove that American companies wouldn't be outperformed even more without high-CEO pay.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.3.3.1. Con: If that's true then perhaps a more effective solution should be searched rather than just throwing more money at CEOs.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.3.1.1.2.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.3.1.1.3.

1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.7. Con: In a free market society high pay will eventually be accompanied by performance of commensurate value, or owners of the business will replace the talent so that there is a match between pay and performance. There are always others ready and available to replace those who fail to add sufficient value.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.2. Pro: This is especially true for the US where CEOs face less restrictions on their actions than in other countries, such as Germany and Japan. Thus, they have more influence on a company's performance \([Crossland/Hambrick, p. 783, 6](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.610/abstract)\).
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.3. Pro: As researchers argue, over the course of the past decades, the influence of CEOs on a company's success has been steadily increasing. At the same time, the relative influence of other factors has been decreasing, such as that of industry factors and the macro-economic environment \([Quigley and Hambrick, p. 825](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2258/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+Saturday,+15+March+from+10:00-12:00+GMT+\(06:00-08:00+EDT\)+for+essential+maintenance)\).
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.3.1. Con: The same researchers caution that part of this effect may be down to the belief in the importance of CEOs and their outright romanticization. This might have incentivized companies to look for great CEOs and provide them with environments that let them prosper \([Quigley and Hambrick, p. 828](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2258/abstract?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+Saturday,+15+March+from+10:00-12:00+GMT+\(06:00-08:00+EDT\)+for+essential+maintenance)\).
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.4. Pro: An analysis of the literature in the field came to the conclusion that, contrary to revisionist views, the corporate strategy choices made by executives do actually matter for the profitability of businesses \([Bowman/Helfat, p. 19](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0266\(200101\)22:1%3C1::AID-SMJ143%3E3.0.CO;2-T/abstract)\).
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.5. Pro: The growth in pay for US CEOs has [corresponded with a comparable growth in the size of US companies](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/business/economy/04view.html?mcubz=0). This indicates that the ability to attract talented executives with attractive compensation packages has been crucial to growth.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.5.1. Con: The economy has grown for lots of reasons, this does not prove that it wouldn't have grown faster with a salary cap. Correlation does not prove causation.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.5.1.1. Pro: New technologies, new industries, growing consumer bases in many countries, and increased trade have all had massive impacts on market growth, so it's difficult to see the effects that a trend of higher CEO pay has actually had on the success of the market.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.6. Pro: More companies performing well leads to economic growth and more jobs, which everybody benefits from.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.6.1. Con: While we might think that companies doing well would lead to job growth, they could easily just pocket the excess.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.6.1.1. Con: It is probably the case that some companies will indeed just pocket the extra profit, but most companies will want to grow larger, as through doing so they can make even more profit. To do this, it will be necessary to hire more workers.
1.1.4.3.2.2.4.6.2. Con: While some people might benefit from job growth, those benefits could be relatively localized.
1.1.4.3.2.2.5. Pro: Certain companies who employ many lower-level workers will be unable to offer sufficiently high salaries to attract quality management.
1.1.4.3.2.2.5.1. Pro: A potential executive might be more likely to choose a position at a boutique consulting firm, law firm or hedge fund, for example, rather than in senior management at a large retail firm, because those other industries would have a higher pay cap.
1.1.4.3.2.2.5.2. Con: Having more lower-level employees doesn't change the math. The salary of the CEO is capped by the ratio in regards to the lowest paid employee, which means that any company with a minimum wage employee has the same CEO salary cap.
1.1.4.3.2.2.5.2.1. Con: Having more low-wage employees makes it more difficult for companies to raise the lowest wage as this would be more expensive. For a company with only few low-wage employees this is less costly.
1.1.4.3.2.2.6. Con: Elsewhere, salary caps do not prevent people from doing their best even though they could opt to change profession, as is illustrated by basketball players in the NBA.
1.1.4.3.2.2.6.1. Con: Skills in many industries are not as clearly transferable as those of a CEO. A basketball player could not just as easily become a football player, whereas a CEO could quite easily transfer from an industry with a low pay cap into one that would have a higher pay cap under this policy. For example, a hedge fund.
1.1.4.3.2.2.6.1.1. Con: An information technology professional, HR person, logistics manager, facilities maintenance specialist, training professional, etc. could enjoy the same sort of portability among industries. The basketball/football example isn't representative of the large field of professions that aren't specific to a particular industry.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7. Pro: If American CEOs were asked to take a drastic cut in pay or to increase their company's payroll cost dramatically, there would be an incentive for top executive talent to work for companies outside the United States.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.1. Con: People don't tend to leave their country of origin, friends and family that easily. So if the cap were on the whole of the US, some might leave but there is unlikely to be a 'mass exodus.'
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.1.1. Con: Rather than people leaving their homes and families, there will be more outsourcing and mega corporations moving entirely out of the US.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2. Pro: The seemingly high compensation of CEOs, famous actors, or professional athletes is only high if you don't consider the number of people who seek to get the job. Such scarce positions act like a lottery and the ticket's worth is based on the price of capital and labor that is forfeited in pursuit of the position. The more people that give up time and money to win, the bigger the pot. If we cap the worth of the pot,this is like capping a lottery payout, it degrades the worth of all tickets.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1. Con: A CEO position's worth- or the worth of a famous actor or athlete- is not "based on the capital and labor that is forfeited in pursuit of the position." Salaries are set by the market and driven up by competition.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1. Con: Very true, salaries are driven by the market. What is referenced by the quote is opportunity cost. Opportunity cost effects the willingness to supply a good or service at a given price. Competition for this position will fall with every market participant who sees that their risk adjusted reward drops below their opportunity cost. Put another way, no supplier will stay in a market where the marginal revenue is less that the marginal cost.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: A maximum cap on salaries would result in a mass exodus of talent - essentially exporting critical knowledge and organization overseas and crippling the competitiveness of US companies in the global marketplace.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.1. Con: If we fear a mass exodus, which is highly unlikely, we could add provisions to a bill stating something like "the highest paid employees can only make up to 35X the lowest waged workers in the company anywhere in the world." We could also say if you start a company in the states if they move their company outside the states they would not be able to sell here in the states. We can always do something to offset any possible loss.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Making laws that disadvantage companies that leave a country only serve to benefit companies that start outside the country rather than inside. An exodus does not have to be existing companies leaving. They can be replaced.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The highest paid levels of corporate officers do not represent critical knowledge or talent. Their primary function is to reorganize companies, often without regard to productivity, in order to raise stock prices. It is the middle managers, and the people on the floor that make companies productive. Executive officers' only loyalty is to those who hire and pay them: the shareholders.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Other tools such as tax incentives would be more effective at increasing the pay of lower level employees without reducing the competitiveness of companies to retain top talent and top performing leadership.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Other tools face their own hurdles and challenges. The effectiveness of other tools shouldn't be used to disregard the tool in question.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.3.2. Con: The claim that limits on CEO pay would reduce the retention of talent or leadership appears unsupported. Indeed, this approach may do wonders toward retaining top talent by offering a greater share of profits to managers and workers below CEO-level, and perhaps increasing the competitiveness and profitability of the firm overall - perhaps leading to higher executive pay.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.4. Con: In 1983, according to Bloomberg news, CEO salaries were [41-times](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/ceo-pay-ratio/) regular employee salaries. Top executives did not emigrate to other countries en masse.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.5. Con: People usually do not change countries en masse as they have family and professional times where they are.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.6. Con: The departure of these individuals wouldn't be particularly bad as their greed isn't beneficial to the country anyway.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.6.1. Con: People who earn a lot of money aren't necessarily greedy.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.6.2. Con: Society needs rich people as their wealth trickles down and helps those who are less fortunate.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.7. Con: Nothing has unlimited benefits. There is an an extent to which competitive US companies benefit the US as a whole. This should be reflected in a salary cap.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.8. Con: Not having a salary cap encourages talent to be motivated by profit, rather than the good of the country. As such, it encourages profitable innovation no matter the "cost" of negative effects.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.9. Con: The issue being discussed is not a maximum cap on salaries. 35 times x has no maximum. It just means you have to make x bigger if you want to make y bigger.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.9.1. Con: It actually is a cap on salaries. If your lowest paid employee is a minimum wage worker, the CEO's salary would be capped unless he paid the worker higher than minimum wage. It would be unfair to the business and the stockholders to raise the compensation of someone that does not have the skills to earn more than minimum wage.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.9.1.1. Con: What would actually be unfair would be for a company so successful to pay its workers so poorly.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.9.1.1.1. Pro: Workers create the wealth for a company, and should the company find great financial success they should be correspondingly recompensed.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.9.1.1.1.1. Con: They are compensated for their work. Something most successful companies have [in common](https://www.ft.com/content/6081b1fc-d0b2-11e5-92a1-c5e23ef99c77) is their employees are happy. If you're not paid well enough you can choose to seek employment elsewhere.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.2. Con: Competition among companies will drive up the cost of a CEO and competition among potential CEOs will drive the price down. This is how competition sets the price.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.3. Con: There are limits to CEO pay already. If a company has any other way of using funds that will create a greater risk adjusted rate of return than increasing CEO compensation then this will be done first. If they ignore these uses and pay CEOs more any way, other companies that put funds to their most productive uses will out-compete them on either price or quality. Just like the market among CEO candidates, companies must also consider their opportunity cost in making decisions.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.2. Con: Unlike the lottery, these jobs have value beyond financial compensation. If there was a cap on salaries there would still be plenty of competition for these jobs.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.2.1. Con: Then it is a lottery for money and status, or money and job perks. Nevertheless, it is still a winner take all system like a lottery. As such, the winner must receive the opportunity cost forfeited by those who where not chosen for the position. This could include many more things than money.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.2.2. Con: No, there would be a reduction in competition commensurate with the reduction in potential reward. In the same way that a smaller lottery must either have smaller prices or smaller ticket sales to have participants, the lottery for Executive pay must do the same. This is simply supply and demand.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.3. Pro: People make decisions in their own interest. The decision to attempt becoming a CEO can be modeled in the following way: \(Potential Compensation*Likelyhood of success*Personal tolerance for risk\)-Compensation at the best alternative position-cost of attempting to become a CEO
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.1.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.3. Con: The US offers CEOs an environment that they might not be able to find elsewhere, for example in terms of quality of life, opportunities and professional networks. Wage caps would therefore probably not be incentive enough to leave the country.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.4. Con: Whenever pro-consumer or pro-worker regulations are proposed, opponents warn of an exodus of skilled workers. So far, if this has happened, it has not been too significant.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.5. Con: If the US institutes this policy, other western liberal democracies are likely to follow suit. This would level the playing field and prevent the US from losing business.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.5.1. Pro: If this policy works in the US, other countries will likely take notice.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.5.1.1. Pro: Political parties in these countries have connections to American parties and often have extensive interaction.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.5.1.1.1. Pro: The Green Party in America is heavily [connected](https://www.globalgreens.org/) to the European Green Parties.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.5.1.1.2. Pro: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the American Republican Party have [been aligned in recent years](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/netanyahu-republicans).
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.5.2. Pro: The US is considered a model democracy and capitalist country. As a result, other countries often tend to model policy based on legislation in the US.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.5.2.1. Pro: The US has had an enormous role in shaping the democracies of countries [such as Germany after WWII](https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1753.html) and Poland after the Cold War.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.5.2.2. Pro: The enormous cultural reach of the US means that media in foreign countries tend to devote lots of coverage and attention to American domestic issues. Often this mean that political trends in America are followed by similar trends in Europe and elsewhere.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.5.2.2.1. Pro: Hungary's Prime Minister has started to [replicate rhetoric](https://qz.com/1067633/hungary-wants-the-eu-to-pay-for-its-trump-like-border-wall/) from Donald Trump.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.5.2.3. Con: Many aspects of US democracy, such as gerrymandering, partisanship, and mass incarceration have tainted the view of US democracy abroad.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.6. Pro: When Ben and Jerry's tied the pay of their highest paid executive to the average wage at their company, they had [a lot of trouble](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/companies-follow-ben-jerrys-lead-wages/story?id=19920634) finding suitable executives.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.6.1. Con: According to the article quoted, they had to raise the ratio  from 5:1 up to 7:1 to attract an executive to replace the retiring founder. Eventually, the ratio was raised to 17:1 until bought out by Unilever. This is less than half of the ratio being suggested in this thesis. This article works against the parent idea that executives would seek work outside the US.
1.1.4.3.2.2.7.7. Con: An exodus of the type of executive that enjoys \(and self-justifies\) a disproportionally high income would be a good thing for society in general.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8. Con: Companies would still be able to compete for top executives within the bounds set by government.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.1. Pro: Companies could still offer higher pay to their executives, but would have to correspondingly raise the income of the lowest paid employees.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.2. Pro: Even with a compensation cap, executive pay could be very generous. The highest paid workers in a company that employs other workers at the [federal minimum wage](https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-are-annual-earnings-full-time-minimum-wage-worker) could still make it comfortably into the current [top 1%](https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-tax-stats-at-a-glance) of earners.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.2.1. Pro: The policy proposed here would affect the most advantaged Americans: the top 1% of earners who make [almost a quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Overview) of the country’s income. Executives at companies who pay employees [at the federal minimum](https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/what-are-annual-earnings-full-time-minimum-wage-worker) wage would have their salary capped at around half a million dollars, which is where the [1% segment starts](http://www.investopedia.com/news/how-much-income-puts-you-top-1-5-10/).
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.2.1.1. Con: It would not necessarily target the top 1% of earners as the salary cap targets inequality in wages not earnings. And earners in the top 1% don't necessarily have a big part of their income as salary.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: In the United States, nearly all those in the top 1% \(making at least half a million dollars in a given year\) receive [less than half](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/09/where-the-rich-make-their-income.html) of their income from salaries and wages. The combination of other sources accounts for a larger share.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.2.1.1.2. Con: This policy refers to pay inclusively. The cap would effect all earnings, not just salary.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.2.1.1.3. Pro: In the United States, those making $10 million in a given year usually receive [only around 15%](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/09/where-the-rich-make-their-income.html) of their income from salaries and wages and vastly more from capital gains.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.3. Pro: Similar to how sports leagues implement maximum contracts, when people know there is an artificial maximum to how much they can earn, they adjust their internal evaluation of the offers they receive accordingly.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.3.1. Pro: A company could use a "max offer" to indicate their level of interest to a candidate.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.3.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.5. Pro: At the top of the pay scale executives would need to choose employers based on other factors, such as prestige or mission of the company. This may encourage companies to act more socially responsibly and result in leaders who are committed to the company in the long term.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.5.1. Pro: The [majority](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/06/07/the-future-of-work-corporate-social-responsiblity-attracts-top-talent/#3b93b99a3f95) of workers want a job where they can "make an impact," even if it would require accepting a pay cut. This widespread desire, among general employees and executives, is driving companies to reenergize their corporate social responsibility \(CSR\) programs.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.6. Pro: The esteem and prestige held by CEOs attracts candidates. While pay is also important, the dramatic pay disparity seen within companies at present may not be necessary.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.6.1. Pro: Companies have a [number of ways](https://www.communication-director.com/issues/making-case/showcasing-ceo) to showcase their CEOs. Each paints the CEO in a very favourable light. This provides the person as much notoriety and esteem as it does the company.
1.1.4.3.2.2.8.6.2. Pro: The hierarchical structure of companies means that  the worker in charge of everyone else naturally develops a sense of self importance that money cannot buy.
1.1.4.3.2.2.9. Con: High pay does not necessarily attract high quality candidates. High pay will attract people who are attracted by high pay. This speaks nothing of their abilities as executives and actually speaks against their moral and ethical viewpoints.
1.1.4.3.3. Con: [CEOs themselves](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/12/want-to-become-ceo-dont-try-too-hard/) claim that reaching their position was not an ambition which drove them, or a goal they set. If this is true then it is not necessary to make the role of CEO itself attractive, it is workers devotion to their jobs and the business that motivates them to become CEO.
1.1.4.4. Con: Fueling the ideology of the American dream also causes the pathologisation of poverty. When a society believes that anybody who works hard enough can become rich, it then follows that poverty is the result of personal failings rather than structural societal issues.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Almost [half](http://www.newsweek.com/why-are-people-poor-lazy-646062) of Christians in the USA believe that people who live in poverty are poor because they are lazy.
1.1.4.5. Con: The American dream is a lie. America is much less socially mobile than [many other comparable countries](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/america-social-mobility-parents-income/399311/).
1.1.4.6. Con: Some income inequality might be good, but the extent of inequality in the US is enormous, far larger than necessary to motivate people to work hard.
1.1.4.7. Con: High income inequality and low social mobility go together, globally as well as in the US \([Kearney/Levine, p. 1, 57](https://www.nber.org/papers/w20195.pdf)\).
1.1.4.7.1. Pro: Through its link to social mobility, income inequality prevents many of the best and brightest from raising to the top, which in turn harms society as a whole.
1.1.4.7.2. Pro: Low social mobility means that an individual's fortune in life is likely to be determined by the social class into which they are born, rather than it being based on need, talent or hard work.
1.1.4.7.3. Pro: Low social mobility leads to a more socially stratified society where different classes are less likely to interact with each other. This makes the trust required for the operation of institutions like the welfare state much more difficult to generate.
1.1.4.7.3.1. Pro: Those in society who are wealthy enough to not require government support lose empathy and understanding for why others do because they experience such different lives. As many as [24%](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/10/09/emerging-and-developing-economies-much-more-optimistic-than-rich-countries-about-the-future/) of US citizens reported that poverty was a result of individuals not working hard enough.
1.1.4.7.4. Pro: Increased income inequality means that ["tuition fees"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/higher-educations-biggest-challenge-is-income-inequality/2013/09/06/94b809a8-15ac-11e3-be6e-dc6ae8a5b3a8_story.html?utm_term=.ca68a199d096), that are aimed at the wealthy, are unaffordable to everyone else. This prevents more people attending University.
1.1.4.7.4.1. Pro: University attendance is overwhelmingly [correlated with increased employment rates.](https://trends.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/education-pays-2013-full-report.pdf) Being unable to afford university thus makes it far more difficult to compete in the job market, and increase wealth.
1.1.4.8. Con: Not only has intergenerational income mobility declined in the United States but “…international comparisons reveal less mobility in America than in other countries with comparably advanced economies, such as Germany, Canada, and Scandinavian countries.” [Mishel, Bernstein, and Allegretto, The State of Working America, 94.](http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=books)
1.1.5. Pro: Angel investors' role in funding companies is important for innovation.
1.1.5.1. Pro: [About 7 to 10%](https://www.svb.com/startup-outlook-report/us/) of the funding that startups receive in the United States comes from angel investors and other sources of micro venture capital.
1.1.5.2. Pro: [Studies imply](http://www.people.hbs.edu/wkerr/KLS-Angels-Oct2011.pdf) that new companies that receive funding from angel investors have higher success rates than other companies, possibly because of the mentorship and advice that angel investors often bring with their money.
1.1.5.3. Pro: In 2016, [almost 65,000 companies](https://paulcollege.unh.edu/sites/paulcollege.unh.edu/files/cvr-reports/2016AnalysisReportFinal_0.pdf) in the US received funding from angel investors. The volume of these investments amounts to [about a third](https://venturebeat.com/2017/01/11/vc-investments-in-u-s-startups-fell-12-in-2016-but-remain-at-historic-levels/) of what large venture capital firms have invested into startups during that year.
1.1.5.4. Con: True, but you don't have to make an exorbitant-CEO-level of pay to be an angel investor. Angel investments are by their very nature [relatively small](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyaprive/2013/03/12/angels-investors-how-the-rich-invest/).
1.1.6. Con: The policy proposed here wouldn't necessarily do away with highly paid executives. Companies will increase salary for the lowest workers to keep current levels of executive pay.
1.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.8.2.
1.1.6.2. Con: Corporations don't have infinite money. It is unreasonable to suggest that corporations will raise all their employees' salaries just to spite a policy.
1.1.7. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.8.2.
1.1.8. Pro: We should not discriminate against exceptionally high earners, as they disproportionally contribute to the government's tax revenue.
1.1.8.1. Pro: The top 10% of earners in the USA pay over half of all [federal income tax](http://dailysignal.com/2015/04/15/how-much-do-the-top-1-percent-pay-of-all-taxes/) even though they account for only 45% of all income.
1.1.8.1.1. Con: The top 10%, which presumably overlaps a good deal with the top 10% of earners, own [76% of the wealth](http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/18/pf/wealth-inequality/index.html), so a low ball of what they should be paying is 76% of taxes, they are royally ripping us off.
1.1.8.1.1.1. Con: It is not necessarily the case that the top 10% in terms of wealth overlaps with the top 10% in terms of earnings taxable as income tax. The main driving factor behind increasing inequality currently is increasing returns from capital relative to wages and salaries, and this is not taxed as regular income.
1.1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.8.2.1.1.1.
1.1.8.1.2. Con: The top 10% of earners in the USA already have a considerable, and growing, amount of wealth, they aren't magically springing from poverty only to be struck down by the mean scary government, they are sitting on gigantic pile of income which, as it turns out, is not exempt from taxes, and the taxing of which does not endanger do to the relatively low tax rate.
1.1.8.1.3. Con: They earn more, so they can afford to pay more of what they earn.
1.1.8.1.4. Con: They received that amount of income, but whether they earned it is a different question. If they didn't, they should pay, directly, or otherwise, what is owed to the people who did earn it.
1.1.9. Con: Highly paid wealthy executives have a limit on the amount they can possibly spend to fulfill their wants and therefore do not benefit society as much as individuals with the same money.
1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.7.2.1.1.1.
1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.
1.4. Pro: Reducing CEO pay will leave additional profit which could be funneled into research and development and therefore major scientific discoveries.
1.4.1. Con: The purpose of a company is to maximize profit. If the shareholders thought an increased R&D budget was more profitable, they would have cut CEO salaries by now.
1.5. Pro: A wage cap would benefit the economy.
1.5.1. Pro: The more US citizens earn, the smaller the proportion of that income that is spent. Marginally increasing the pay of those who earn less will see far more money invested in the economy than when the wealth is owned by fewer CEOs.
1.5.1.1. Pro: In the case where successful companies would see a resulting increase in workers' salaries, we might expect to see a corresponding growth in demand for various goods and services as the purchasing power of the average consumer increases, resulting in economic growth, and more innovation and market competition.
1.5.1.2. Con: The more US citizens earn, the more free capital they have for investment.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Investment capital is required to fund innovation through R&D, which leads to higher quality of life for everyone.
1.5.1.3. Con: Low-income earners and even the middle-class saves a considerably smaller proportion of its income than the wealthiest. \([more on that](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2016-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2015-Income-and-Savings.htm) \) The measure could increase demand, but it would decrease supply because of the lack of investment caused by the decreased savings available for investment \(-\> inflation\). More on the causality [here](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/11/07/what-obama-can-learn-from-india/higher-savings-higher-investment) and [here](https://mises.org/wire/saving-%E2%80%94-not-spending-%E2%80%94-engine-economic-growth).
1.5.1.4. Pro: More money being spent in the economy is an increase in demand for products. Each purchase of goods [creates more income](http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Managing_the_economy/The_multiplier_effect.html) for the supplier, which can then be invested. This constantly increasing benefit to the economy is known as the multiplier effect.
1.5.1.4.1. Con: The demand would increase, but the supply would decrease or stagnate, since producers wouldn't invest as easily when less savings are available \(because people spend a larger portion of their money\). Inflation is the result. More on that [here](https://mises.org/wire/saving-%E2%80%94-not-spending-%E2%80%94-engine-economic-growth) and [here](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/11/07/what-obama-can-learn-from-india/higher-savings-higher-investment).
1.5.1.4.2. Pro: This means that even a slight increase of wealth provided to those worst off in society will have a significant effect in benefiting the economy.
1.5.1.5. Pro: Americans who earn over $150,000 per annum [save](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/08/01/157664524/how-the-poor-the-middle-class-and-the-rich-spend-their-money) on average 15.9% of their income, while those earning under 20,000 save an average of 2.6% of their income.
1.5.1.5.1. Pro: Because the absolute amount earned by those who earn most is so large, their choice to save 39% of their wealth represents a significant amount of money taken out of circulation.
1.5.1.6. Pro: The lowest-earning third of Americans spends, on average, [182%](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/23/news/economy/poor-spending/index.html) of their income; the highest-earning third spends only 61% of its income. This means that 39% of the income earned by the highest earning third is not reinvested in the economy in exchange for goods and services.
1.5.2. Con: Wage caps would disincentivize workers on all levels to grow and succeed, thereby harming the economy as a whole.
1.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.5.3. Con: A maximum wage for CEOs would lead to fewer businesses being founded. This will weaken the economy.
1.5.3.1. Con: CEOs of startups typically [aren't compensated exorbitantly](http://www.businessinsider.com/salaries-startup-founders-pay-themselves-2014-4). They are working to make their equity stake valuable, not to receive high pay.
1.5.4. Pro: A wage cap would give CEOs the incentive to pay workers more. This would benefit the country economically as it would lead to more tax revenue and more spending. It's a win win situation.
1.6. Pro: Money is not linked to happiness past a certain point. In Northern America this tipping point is $105,000 per year according to a [recent study](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/02/26/does-money-equal-happiness-does-until-you-earn-much/374119002/). Salaries higher than that are a waste of money and can even lead to a lower happiness.
1.6.1. Con: Depends on the region and the cost of living. Along with that it depends on how many children that person has. On average, to raise a child costs $245k per child. Extra money allows you to provide more for them, giving them a better chance.
1.6.2. Con: The maximization of happiness is not the purpose of high salaries. Instead, these salaries allow the wealthy to save/invest which is a crucial function in any economy. Saving allows for investment, and therefore production.
1.6.2.1. Con: If high salaries are solely for investing, that is bad, because individual investors can be bad and use the money for ill or incompetent purposes.
1.6.2.2. Con: Increased salaries for the poor/middle class would allow those people to be able to save as well, whereas right now most Americans have very little in savings.
1.6.3. Con: It's not the government's job to legislate happiness.
1.6.3.1. Con: Since the "pursuit of happiness" is regarded as a universal right in the Declaration of Independence the government can not disregard legislation in this perspective.
1.6.4. Con: Following this logic, wage caps should limit compensation at around $105.000 per year and not be relative in nature.
1.6.4.1. Con: It wouldn't cost less to produce because the lower quality of CEOs would lead to poorer decisions.
1.6.4.2. Con: The "Maybe 10x" in your agrument proves an important point: On what criteria should the max wage be fixed? From an economic stand point, the current wages aren't too high. From a social stand point, if you want equality, why not fix it at 1x or 2x the minimum wage? Fixing an arbitrary regulation has terrible consequences, both social and economic.
1.7. Con: A business exists to create value. Compensation should be determined by a person's work and role in terms of value to the business, therefore high executive performance should be compensated accordingly.
1.7.1. Pro: An employee who has worked their way up to an executive position has likely provided the company with surplus value over the course of their employment. High executive pay is just recompense for those years of under-compensated labor.
1.7.1.1. Pro: An elementary economic principle holds that companies hire, maintain, and promote employees when the value added by the employee is greater than the cost.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Thus, high executive pay is justified as recompense for years of being underpaid.
1.7.1.1.2. Pro: Using this principle, high-executive pay is justified, as proper compensation for the amount of value added to the company.
1.7.1.1.2.1. Con: Companies do not set pay based purely on whether a level of pay is justified or not, or how much value is added.  This just sets the maximum acceptable level of pay, not the ideal level.  Ideally \(from the company's point of view\) an employee should be paid as little as possible, regardless of value added.
1.7.1.1.3. Con: Whether or not it is an "elementary" economic principle does not have any impact on the truth of that principle; the principle doesn't take into account much less "elementary" economic realities that [prove that this position is incorrect](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1572085).
1.7.1.2. Con: If the employee has been providing significant surplus value over the course of long employment, any reward for this should come at the time that such value is generated, and the employee should not have to wait to reach executive level.
1.7.1.3. Con: In large companies managers rise through the ranks by increasing the surplus value extracted from the employees beneath them. This may be good for the owners of the company but it's detrimental to society as a whole. Therefore society is justified in disincentivizing this.
1.7.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.
1.7.1.4. Con: By far not all executives work their way up within a company. Among the world's 2.500 largest companies, [22%](https://hbr.org/2016/04/outsider-ceos-are-on-the-rise-at-the-worlds-biggest-companies) of planned successions brought into office an CEO from outside the company. These rates are rising.
1.7.1.5. Con: Capping salary of top execs will increase salaries throughout, which will eliminate or reduce the under-compensation of the lower paid employees, and thus reduce or eliminate the need for recompense.
1.7.2. Con: Any good company is the sum of its parts and no one employee is responsible for making the machine run. If any role were to be removed, the company could not function.Therefore, a CEO is really only marginally more important than a janitor.
1.7.2.1. Con: A CEO often makes decisions on the direction of the business, risk mitigation, strategic growth opportunities, financial performance and capital structure decisions. The thought that a janitor adds similar value to a business is a bit extreme, in my opinion.
1.7.2.2. Con: If a janitor is removed, there are multiple qualified candidates ready to replace that person. It's not the same with experienced and successful executives.
1.7.2.3. Con: A CEO is the first person to go if a company is failing. They shoulder the bulk of the responsibility for a companies success. Their decisions carry much more weight than that of a janitor, therefore they are far more important to a company than the lowest paid employee.
1.7.2.3.1. Con: A CEO is almost never the "first employee to go"; almost by definition. If a company is failing, it is typically up to the CEO to cut labor costs before addressing executive restructuring.
1.7.3. Con: The performance indicators on which the compensations are based are often influenced by factors over which the CEO has no influence such as the state of the economy, exchange rates, the stock market, and the price of raw material. A study by [Bertrand and Mullainthan](http://w3.ced.unicz.it/upload/migali/Bertrand_etal_2001.pdf) \(2001\) found that up to 56% of a CEOs compensation is based on factors out of their control.
1.7.4. Con: In many cases, the executive performances that are rewarded can hardly be seen as being in the company's best interest.
1.7.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.1.1.2.
1.7.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.1.1.1.
1.7.5. Con: In practice pay is divorced from actual value to the company because of too much self-dealing \(i.e. [conflicts of interest in the pay-setting process](http://fortune.com/2012/10/01/were-having-the-wrong-debate-on-ceo-pay/)\) and too little accountability to shareholders \(generally limited to [non-binding resolutions](https://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/a-brief-history-of-say-on-pay/) at best\).
1.7.6. Pro: Limiting payment for continued work will directly impact inventors and creators because now there is no incentive to work harder if they are already maxed out in pay.
1.7.7. Con: While compensation "should" be determined by a person's work and role in terms of value added to a business, that is not how businesses determine compensation. Instead, compensation is determined through a negotiation process where the employer seeks to get the most value out of the employee for the least amount of money.
1.7.8. Con: While senior executives may work harder than lower-paid employees, it seems unlikely that they work more than 35 times as hard, so a cap would still allow a company to reward an executive's hard work.
1.7.8.1. Con: The pay of executives is not based on how hard they work but on the value they create. An ordinary worker cannot create much value - whereas the decisions of a senior executive can.
1.7.8.1.1. Con: A 28 Year [study](http://faculty.london.edu/aedmans/RoweAMP.pdf) conducted by Alex Edmans found that employee job satisfaction increases the value of the firm.
1.7.8.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.
1.7.8.1.2. Con: An executive without ordinary workers is worth nothing. While their jobs involve taking more risk thus deserve more pay on success, they also risk the ordinary workers' jobs. So it shouldn't be too high of a difference in pay.
1.7.8.1.3. Con: It is difficult to quantify what is meant by 'value' that an individual executive contributes to a company.
1.7.8.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.4.2.
1.7.9. Con: High performance based pay \(in the form of large bonuses and stock options\) often incentivizes behavior that is not in the company's or the public's interest.
1.7.9.1. Pro: The problem with unlimited compensation, especially in a publicly traded company; it creates “shareholder capitalism”. Executive pay is often linked to share performance, enticing taking on debt and/or using cash to buyback stock, boosting value without growing the company. Capping compensation would limit this practice and allow true growth, good for everyone involved. Otherwise the metrics reach a critical point of overvaluation, and contributes to the next bust cycle with crippling debt.
1.7.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.1.1.1.
1.7.9.3. Pro: Research suggests that paying executives based on their performance encourages problematic behavior and thus [financial misrepresentation](http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.1060.0241), [the probability of shareholder litigation](https://academic.oup.com/rof/article-abstract/12/1/141/1581120?redirectedFrom=PDF) and of [product safety problems](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2277/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=).
1.7.10. Con: Performance-based pay is [unnecessary](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/24/bankers-still-overpaid-says-top-banker-john-cryan-bonuses-deutsche-bank) to reward good executives, because they are motivated by a desire to grow the company in the long-term, rather than seek a slight increase in their compensation that year.
1.7.10.1. Pro: [High pay doesn't mean high satisfaction.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesleadershipforum/2011/09/08/will-a-raise-make-you-like-your-job-better/)
1.7.10.2. Pro: Studies have [shown](https://hbr.org/2016/02/stop-paying-executives-for-performance) that performance-based pay increases performance in routine tasks, but has no impact on high-level management performance.
1.7.11. Con: Executive pay packages are [determined](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-executive-pay-peer-groups/) by what CEOs of other firms are paid, and therefore is often unrelated to internal performance.
1.7.11.1. Con: This may be true; however, internal performance determines whether or not CEO's get to keep their jobs. They can easily be replaced by other great minds. Boards of Directors are no joke and in most cases put shareholders ahead of their relationships with the CEO's.
1.7.11.2. Pro: The popular practice of [benchmarking](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/how-companies-decide-ceo-pay/530127/) executive pay creates a feedback loop, where an increase in one CEO's pay is calculated into the market group of CEOs, who then demand corresponding increases, further driving up average compensation.
1.7.11.3. Con: This does not mean that CEOs are paid too much. The particular skills they have are not common, and where the supply is low, prices are accordingly high.
1.7.12. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.4.1.
1.7.13. Pro: The difference between executive compensation and worker compensation can be explained by the [growing size of companies](https://hbr.org/2017/02/why-we-need-to-stop-obsessing-over-ceo-pay-ratios). The decisions of CEOs can result in wins or losses in the range of billions, whereas decisions by other workers do not.
1.7.13.1. Con: This implies a scaling of duties, but a company six times the size is not necessarily, or even probably, six times as hard to manage.
1.7.13.2. Con: This argument should then apply equally to other parts of companies that see growing stakes as companies grow, for example IR and marketing. Yet we don't see comparable rises in compensation there
1.7.13.3. Con: The pay differentiation between management and labor is a result of moral hazard, not a result of inherent functional difference. [As this article demonstrates](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/how-companies-decide-ceo-pay/530127/), the practice of compensating executives according to external benchmarks, rather than metrics internal to the organization such as payscale, did not emerge from factors of rational business administration. The practice emerged from sales tactics of executive-compensation consultants leveraging the self-interest of executives.
1.7.14. Pro: Leadership roles such as executive offices require workers with skills or characteristics that are unique or not easily substituted.
1.7.14.1. Con: Unique characteristics still do not justify the massive difference in salaries between CEO's and other members of a company. A maximum wage would still allow unique workers to be compensated, just not at an unreasonable level.
1.7.14.2. Con: These characteristics may be rarer, but they are not 'unique', i.e. occurring in one instance only. People can grow as leaders and be trained to progressively take on more leadership responsibility. The above point implies that there is some sort of finite supply that therefore drives up the cost, but this is not the case.
1.8. Con: Governments ought not interfere with corporate compensation structures.
1.8.1. Pro: Anytime the government involves itself in the labor market by artificially setting labor rate minimums or maximums, you can expect a negative impact. By setting a minimum, you're pricing anyone who cannot produce at least that minimum in value for a business out of the market, which drives unemployment and dependence on government. By setting a maximum, you're disincentivizing those who achieve that maximum from doing more in the way of innovation.
1.8.2. Pro: Worker unions are a better way to regulate Executive pay \(and other management issues\) than government.
1.8.3. Pro: A privately owned company is an extension of its owners. It is not a legal person but is literally an individual, or group of individuals, buying resources and hiring people to do work with those resources. The people buying the resources and putting others to work should be able to pay themselves whatever they want.
1.8.4. Pro: Corporate freedom in deciding about worker compensation has been part of the recipe that produced America's economic success during the past centuries.
1.8.5. Pro: Companies could implement wage caps themselves if they see it as beneficial.
1.8.6. Con: The government ought to act in accordance with the will of the people.
1.8.6.1. Con: Democratic governments are elected to make decisions in the interests of voters and the nation as a whole. There are good reasons to assume that public opinion does not necessarily represent these interests, especially as voters are generally mis- or uninformed.
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: Voters are generally uninformed about the economic basics of their country. The [average estimate](http://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/poll-finding/data-note-americans-views-on-the-u-s-role-in-global-health/) of Americans is that their country spends a quarter of its budget on foreign aid \(the true share is 1%\). Another survey shows that 42% of Californians believe that their state spends more on prisons than on education and health services \([PPIC, p. 10](http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/survey/S_115MBS.pdf)\).
1.8.6.1.2. Pro: US citizens believe that wealth distribution in the US is far more equal than it actually is. For example, they have been[found to believe](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20ariely.pdf) the wealthiest 20% of citizens own 59% of the wealth, when in fact they own 84%.
1.8.6.2. Con: Given [Arrow's Impossibility Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem), the idea of a "will of the people" is mostly a meaningless concept. From [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arrows-impossibility-theorem.asp): "Arrow's impossibility theorem states that a clear order of preferences cannot be determined while adhering to mandatory principles of fair voting procedures."
1.8.7. Con: Capitalism coerces people into selling their labour in order to survive. All wage labour of this kind is essentially exploitation, and though it can't ban wage labour outright, the government ought to protect workers from the worst excesses of this exploitation as much as it can.
1.8.7.1. Con: A person is responsible for themselves. They should take whatever job is available even while seeking to improve themselves and their prospects.
1.8.7.2. Pro: Without any government interference in corporate compensation structures, companies would seek to pay their workers as low a wage as possible.
1.8.7.2.1. Pro: Because every firm would now be incentivised to pay workers low wages, a race to the bottom would be facilitated and the living standards of workers would fall generally.
1.8.7.2.1.1. Con: Incentives already exist in the market to increase compensation for low-paid employees.
1.8.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: The wages of an average worker already [outpace](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/upshot/the-question-isnt-why-wage-growth-is-so-low-its-why-its-so-high.html?action=click&contentCollection=business&module=NextInCollection&region=Footer&pgtype=article&version=column&rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Feconomic-view) their productivity growth. Intervention to assist these people is not strictly necessary.
1.8.7.2.1.1.1.1. Con: [The article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/upshot/the-question-isnt-why-wage-growth-is-so-low-its-why-its-so-high.html?action=click&contentCollection=business&module=NextInCollection&region=Footer&pgtype=article&version=column&rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Feconomic-view&_r=0) attributes some of the rise in wages to state-mandated increases in the minimum wage.
1.8.7.2.1.1.1.2. Con: The average worker isn't the segment of the workforce likely to benefit from this intervention. The people who need this kind of intervention are minimum-wage employees, who make less than [MIT's Living Wage Calculator](http://livingwage.mit.edu/) says is necessary for a single adult [in all 50 states \(The Atlantic, 2015\)](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/living-wage-calculator-interactive-minimum-wage/404569/).
1.8.7.2.1.1.2. Con: Given top CEOs currently earn [hundreds of times](http://fortune.com/2015/06/22/ceo-vs-worker-pay/) more than the average worker, these incentives clearly aren't working.
1.8.7.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: In addition, the ratio between the pay of CEOs and workers has been [steadily increasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_compensation_in_the_United_States) over decades. Thus, there is no evidence that these incentives have any effect.
1.8.7.2.1.1.2.2. Con: If there were no incentives against such type of CEO pay, then CEO pay would be even higher than it is now.
1.8.7.2.1.1.3. Con: The problem does not lie with the wage level of those at the bottom; it lies with the wage level of those at the top. There are apparently no effective incentives to cap executive pay.
1.8.7.2.1.1.4. Pro: Employee satisfaction is [positively](http://faculty.london.edu/aedmans/Rowe.pdf) correlated with company performance: the 100 Best Companies to Work For in America outperform their peers by 2-3% per year.
1.8.7.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Studies of S&P 500 companies indicate that there is [no visible correlation](https://www.fastcompany.com/3050281/does-a-huge-pay-gap-between-ceo-and-staff-affect-employee-satisfaction) between how CEO pay compares to the payment of other workers and employee satisfaction.
1.8.7.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.1.
1.8.7.2.1.1.5. Con: Given that the government [has to support](http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/the-high-public-cost-of-low-wages/) tens of millions of working adults with more than $150 billion each year in payments, the incentives to increase low wages to at least a livable level are clearly not working.
1.8.7.2.1.1.5.1. Con: Much of this has to do with the [welfare cliff](https://fee.org/articles/if-you-accept-this-raise-you-fall-off-the-welfare-cliff/?utm_source=zapier&utm_medium=facebook) rather than solely businesses. Some people stay on government assistance because taking a raise would result in a loss in net income
1.8.7.2.1.1.6. Pro: Information about compensation is freely available, if shareholders, employees, or clients/customers wish to lobby for change.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1. Con: The stakeholders who are most empowered to lobby for change \(shareholders and clients\), are also the ones whose interest run counter to fairer wage policies.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Shareholders' primary interest is profit, and higher wages would eat into this.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Clients' primary interests include cost/price, and fairer wages are likely to increase this.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3. Con: Because shareholders ultimately bear the costs of compensating the company's employees, they should be the ones to determine how much is paid.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: Shareholders know the unique situation of the company best and therefore are better positioned to create equitable compensation structures and improve overall working conditions for the lowest-paid employees.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.2. Con: While shareholders may bear the cost for paying those at the top, society bears the cost for ensuring that those at the bottom of the pay scale can also make a living.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.4.2.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.3. Pro: Shareholders should care about the compensation of the company's executives because it reduces the money/capital available to the company to be invested in profitable projects that could raise the share price.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.4. Pro: Under the [Dodd-Frank Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act), shareholders in publicly traded companies already vote on executive compensation packages.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.4.1. Con: These votes are a mere formality. In 2013, only 2% of companies, and 1% of the Fortune 500, had a compensation package [rejected](https://www.towerswatson.com/en-CA/Insights/Newsletters/Global/executive-pay-matters/2013/Infographic-Say-on-Pay-Today) by shareholders.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.4.2. Pro: Even when compensation packages are ultimately approved, firms with initially high CEO pay reduce the total CEO pay by around 38% when targeted by a vote-no campaign \([Ertimur et. al., p. 537-8](http://www.jstor.org.tkc.idm.oclc.org/stable/40985857)\).
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.5. Pro: Shareholders should care about executive compensation because any money paid to the executives are not available to the shareholders as dividends.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.6. Pro: Shareholders should care about executive compensation as reducing inequality may increase productivity of the company by changing the culture of the company in a positive way.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.6.1. Pro: Workers are likely to feel less resentful toward their bosses if they aren't being paid exponentially more than them. Salary caps would lead to a more positive working environment and increased productivity.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.1.1.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.6.1.3. Con: Surveys indicate that of the employees who are aware of the executive pay in the company they work for, [about 80%](http://www.payscale.com/data-packages/ceo-pay/employee-reaction) believe that it is at an appropriate level.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.6.1.4. Pro: Whole Foods caps executive salaries at 19 times the amount of the lowest-paid worker, [citing](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/walter-robb-salary_n_3459029.html) increased solidarity and company unity.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.6.1.4.1. Pro: Whole Foods has a [staff turnover of only 9% and less than 3% at 'Team Leader' level](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/walter-robb-salary_n_3459029.html). The Co-CEO attributes this to the pay policy.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.6.1.4.2. Con: This cap only applies to salary, and not total compensation.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.6.1.4.2.1. Con: If capping the salary alone creates benefit, it can be extrapolated that capping salary and compensation would create a greater effect.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.4. Con: Shareholders are unlikely to lobby against decreasing CEO pay. They have a financial incentive to want money to be reinvested in the company or spent on derivatives.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.5.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.2. Con: Employees are the only ones who are likely to benefit from fairer wages, and they are also the least empowered to lobby for change.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.6.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.3. Con: In the United States, the influence of workers over those who run companies as well as their pay is [very limited](http://fortune.com/2014/11/04/why-do-american-ceos-make-twice-as-much-as-german-ceos/). In some countries, representatives of workers participate in controlling executives through separate institutions like [corporate supervisory boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisory_board).
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.4. Pro: Under the Dodd-Frank Act, public companies are required to [disclose](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2013-186#.Uozu-2RDs4p) the median annual total compensation for all employees at their company, as well as the ratio of that median to the CEO's compensation.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.4.1. Con: Companies only have incentives to lower the ceiling or raise the floor, meaning median income is unlikely to change.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.4.1.1. Con: This claim is true whether this salary cap exists or not. The current minimum wage doesn't provide incentive to increase the median wage either.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.4.2. Con: Surveys indicate that [more than half](http://www.payscale.com/data-packages/ceo-pay/employee-reaction) of employees do not know how much the executives of the company they work for are being paid.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.4.2.1. Con: Employees will almost certainly take notice after this sort of salary cap is passed.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.4.2.1.1. Pro: Media organizations and interested employees are likely to publish this information online.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.4.2.1.2. Pro: This is likely to create dialogue in the office and change the work environment.
1.8.7.2.1.1.6.4.2.1.3. Pro: People will want to know how much their CEO is paid when it affects how much they are paid.
1.8.7.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.
1.8.7.2.1.3. Con: The effect of this is lessened by the 35x salary to CEOs and other executives. This means the companies retain an incentive to pay their executives at a higher amount which will have the effect of lifting wages for the lowest earning workers.
1.8.7.2.1.4. Con: Were this claim true, all workers would be paid the lowest legal wage, which is [demonstrably false](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2015/home.htm).
1.8.7.2.1.4.1. Con: One incentive is not the sole determiner of action. Other factors come into play.
1.8.7.2.1.5. Con: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.4.1.
1.8.7.2.1.6. Pro: Worker abuse and mistreatment is the subject of [The Jungle,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle) and [a core theme of The Grapes of Wrath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath).
1.8.7.2.2. Pro: Companies make a profit by keeping costs of production low - especially [the cost of labor](http://www.epi.org/blog/true-cost-of-low-prices-is-exploited-workers/). Without interference, they have every incentive to keep wages low.
1.8.7.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.1.
1.8.7.2.3. Con: Most employees of most companies make [more](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2016/home.htm) than the minimum wage, even though it is not required by government. Only 2.7% of hourly workers make the minimum wage or less.
1.8.7.3. Pro: [Marxists](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm) argue that the value of a produced commodity or product comes entirely from the labour of workers. Profit, the difference between what the product is sold for and what the worker is paid, is therefore effectively the theft of surplus value from the worker. Governments ought therefore protect workers by limiting the scope of this theft inasmuch as they can.
1.8.7.3.1. Con: The mentioned definition of profit is not the correct definition of profit. The difference between product price point and worker wage has no real bearing; it is meaningless. The "theft" from this meaningless metric also has no bearing.
1.8.7.3.2. Con: Even accepting this understanding of value, workers should be free to sell their labour at whatever price they want. Their labour is not stolen, becasue they freely choose to give it for payment.
1.8.7.3.2.1. Con: Given that under capitalism they have to work in order to earn enough money to survive, workers are not 'free' to sell their labour in any material sense.
1.8.7.3.2.2. Con: This creates a large scale collective action problem which drives down wages and means in reality workers are forced to sell their labour for much less than they would like to.
1.8.7.3.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.
1.8.7.3.3. Con: "Theft" implies the non-consensual taking of a thing from a person. In the case of a person who consents to the amount of money they will be paid for the product they produce for another person or a company, and they are free to choose between more than one employment option, this cannot be considered theft. This case is arguably fairly common among many workers in modern Capitalist societies.
1.8.7.3.4. Con: Under this assumption, fruits that are harder to pick/harvest would be more valuable than easier to gather fruit, regardless of the popularity/taste/preferences for fruit
1.8.7.3.4.1. Pro: The [Subjective Theory of Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value) is a much more useful and accurate theory for prices than the Labor Theory of Value. That is, prices are based off a mix of how much buyers are willing to pay for widget A and the price at which sellers value money more than widget A, based on their preferences for money vs. Widget A.
1.8.7.3.4.1.1. Con: The Subjective Theory of Value, and the Labor theory of value are non-contradictory, one deals with the value of an item, while the other deals with where that value comes from.
1.8.7.3.5. Con: The space the items are produced in over the time it took to make them, and the information needed to make the product, the equipment to do so, and other factors can be considered goods owned by the company, the value of which needs to be considered in addition to the raw materials.
1.8.7.3.6. Pro: This argument is a large part of the reason we have labor unions, which are generally recognized, and respected, as positive entities.
1.8.7.4. Pro: It is possible for an employee to have limited choices in relation to jobs: the choice between employment and a dignified life on the one hand, and unemployment, government support and a life in dependency and possibly in poverty or near poverty on the other hand. The choice that they ultimately have is between a lowly paid position or dependency on government support. It is questionable whether such a choice can ever be truly voluntary.
1.8.7.4.1. Con: Minimum wage laws that are imposed on a [federal](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/minimumwage) level, and by [individual states](https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm), ensure that employees are not offered an unjust level of pay. If it is too low than the solution is to raise it. There is no need to dictate the ratio between employees and executives.
1.8.7.4.2. Pro: This salary may be insufficient to look after a family.
1.8.7.4.3. Pro: This salary may be disproportionately low when the ratio of the wage is compared with the highest paid employee. This indicates exploitation.
1.8.7.4.4. Pro: So long as people are willing to work for a low salary, the companies will continue to pay its employees at a low rate.
1.8.7.4.4.1. Pro: That's how prices work. Your wage is nothing more than the price of your labor.
1.8.7.5. Con: People need to labor because of scarcity, not because of capitalism. Therefore, it is the existence of scarcity that "coerces" people to work. Scarcity exists under all types of economic organization and, therefore, a contract to sell labor in return for money/goods/services is not necessarily exploitative.
1.8.7.5.1. Pro: Poverty is the natural state if the world, wealth is the exception.
1.8.7.6. Con: Government provides social welfare systems that can support people.
1.8.7.6.1. Con: In welfare states that operate based on a pay in system of social insurance \(which the US does\), it is often genuinely impossible to survive on welfare alone, certainly in a way that resemble any kind of a life. According to [this article,](https://www.thebalance.com/welfare-programs-definition-and-list-3305759) an unemployed person would make a little over $1000 a month with tax deductions, and medical insurance.
1.8.7.6.2. Con: This could be considered a viable alternative to welfare programs, assuming one found those objectionable.
1.8.7.7. Con: Individuals can elect to work for themselves.
1.8.7.7.1. Pro: Companies can describe their employees as self employed freelancers and can sub contract them for specific jobs.
1.8.7.7.1.1. Pro: In order to avail of cheap labour without having to decrease the wages of those paid most, companies may sub-contract menial labour rather than hiring staff.
1.8.7.7.1.1.1. Con: In the US at least, it's already illegal to hire 'contractors' to act in a role that would normally be an employee's role. There are also already tax and cost incentives for companies to take this illegal action. So this risk doesn't represent a significant change to the status quo.
1.8.7.7.1.1.2. Pro: This would also eliminate mid level manager positions whose primary function was to supervise the low wage employees, further expanding the upper absolute limits of the 35:1 factor.
1.8.7.7.1.1.2.1. Con: Supervision of these employees would still exist, but the role may change slightly e.g. A mid level manager whose role is now to liaise with contract holders, supervise sub-contracted employees, review the current contract holders and the alternative options if the current contractors are dissatisfactory.
1.8.7.7.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.6.2.
1.8.7.7.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.6.
1.8.7.7.1.1.5. Con: This is already common practice wherever possible because they ["eliminate part of the costs with welfare taxes."](http://www.pcc.usp.br/files/text/personal_files/francisco_cardoso/papercibchilew62subcontractors.pdf) These massive savings already represent enough incentive to sub contract wherever possible, so this policy would make no difference.
1.8.7.7.1.1.5.1. Con: Were this policy to be introduced, it would be in CEO's personal interest to sub contract the lowest earning jobs, so that they do not drag down their own pay. This is a stronger incentive to sub contract in every instance, not only when it makes financial sense for the company.
1.8.7.7.1.1.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.6.2.
1.8.7.7.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.6.1.
1.8.7.7.1.1.5.2. Pro: By 2015,  nearly[6%](https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2016/self-employment-in-the-united-states/pdf/self-employment-in-the-united-states.pdf) of Us workers were self employed, providing services to companies on an individual contract basis.
1.8.7.7.1.1.6. Pro: A ["subcontractor is responsible for their own tax payment"](http://www.frg.ie/your-say/the-employee-and-the-subcontractor/), rather than the employer [having to pay employee taxes](http://www.hcr-llc.com/blog/7-reasons-why-subcontracting-may-be-right-for-you). This means that tax collection is far more difficult for the state.
1.8.7.7.1.1.6.1. Pro: It is impossible to know of all labour carried out unless the company or the sub contractor chooses to register it for taxation. This creates an obvious opportunity to avoid paying taxes.
1.8.7.7.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Annually, this represents a loss of [30%](http://www.broadsheet.ie/2017/06/26/self-employment-is-not-working/) per employee.
1.8.7.7.1.1.6.2. Con: Because regulatory authorities can audit and fine self employed laborers, they have the same incentive to report their taxes as a company would. This system is effectively used for self employed individuals already.
1.8.7.7.1.1.7. Con: The decrease in cost for employers means that they can employ more individuals by embarking on projects, e.g. building projects, more readily. This means that a drive towards sub contracting may well lead to an increase in labour done and thus more employment.
1.8.7.7.1.1.7.1. Pro: With an unemployment rate of [4.3%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate), the US should prioritise the employment opportunities available to individuals.
1.8.7.7.1.1.7.1.1. Con: The level of income provided to most workers who are sub contracted is so low that in the UK their wages must be [supplemented by social welfare](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/05/self-employed-freedom-underpaid-contractors). Employment in this manner does not provide an adequate standard of living, that we should consider those engaged as employed at all.
1.8.7.7.1.1.7.2. Pro: Individuals have a right to agree to whatever labour they wish. An increase in paid work being offered only increases individuals choice as to where to work.
1.8.7.7.1.1.8. Pro: An increased reliance on subcontractors [exacerbates income inequality.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/silicon-valley-subcontracting-income-inequality-worse-report)
1.8.7.7.1.1.8.1. Pro: Sub contractors ["earn less money, have less access to healthcare"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/30/silicon-valley-subcontracting-income-inequality-worse-report) than their directly employed counterparts. This means that they are perpetually economically disadvantaged.
1.8.7.7.1.1.8.2. Pro: Workplace fissuring is likely to lead to a decrease in social mobility. A janitor is unable to be promoted anymore when they don't work at the company, but instead at a janitorial services contractor.
1.8.7.7.1.1.9. Con: Economies of scale help to drive down costs through sub contracting.
1.8.7.7.1.1.9.1. Pro: When any single company hires cleaning staff, for instance, the staff are likely to spend a lot of time with little pressing work. Comparatively, a cleaning company can have staff move from client to client.
1.8.7.7.1.1.9.2. Con: The costs of menial labor are likely driven down so much already in the status quo that this difference is marginal. It is unlikely that much more money can be squeezed out of these workers, or that this difference would be economically significant.
1.8.7.7.2. Con: It is not a given that everyone is able to just start working for themselves, though undoubtedly some can.
1.8.8. Pro: The government should allow all voluntary transactions to occur in the market, unless there is harm occurring to another party.
1.8.8.1. Pro: Many employees, such as students, are happy to work at lower rates because they have very little experience and the pay is [sufficient for their needs.](https://www.millennialstar.org/why-dont-greedy-companies-pay-their-employees-higher-salaries/) It is unfair for the state to arbitrarily place limits on what pay they can accept.
1.8.8.2. Con: The government should legislate in the interests of the general welfare, even if there is no obvious or immediate individual harm.
1.8.8.3. Pro: According to the [International Institute for the Unification of Private Law \(UNIDROIT\)](https://www.unidroit.org/instruments/commercial-contracts/unidroit-principles-2010/414-chapter-1-general-provisions/863-article-1-1-freedom-of-contract), "The right of people to decide freely on the terms of individual transactions is one of the cornerstones of an open, market-oriented and competitive international economic order."
1.8.8.4. Pro: This is consistent with the legal doctrine of [freedom of contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_contract), which has been applied by the US Supreme Court and English judiciary.
1.8.8.4.1. Con: The US Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution permits the restriction of liberty of contract by the government where such restriction protected the community, health and safety, or vulnerable groups \([West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Hotel_Co._v._Parrish), 1937.\)
1.8.8.4.2. Pro: In [Lochner v. New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_v._New_York) \(1905\), the Supreme Court struck down a law limiting the number of working hours and affirmed that people have the right to work on any terms they choose. This logic broadly affirms a person's freedom to contract for any amount of pay, even if compensation might appear unfair to an outsider.
1.8.8.5. Con: Income inequality damages the lives of many US citizens, at both a social and individual level.
1.8.8.5.1. Pro: Wealth inequality has started to create a de-facto "caste" system, where wages [stagnate, despite overall economic prosperity.](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/economy-budget/332421-our-unemployment-rate-is-great-but-why-arent-wages-rising)
1.8.8.5.2. Con: The ills of poverty are often conflated with income inequality, but they are separate issues. For example, few would argue income inequality in Monaco has resulted in serious societal problems within that country.
1.8.8.5.3. Pro: Research suggests a correlation between income, happiness and life satisfaction. Income inequality thus translates into inequality of subjective well-being \([Kahneman/Deaton, p. 16491f.](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full.pdf); [Stevenson/Wolfers, p. 602f.](http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/Papers/Satiation\(AER\).pdf)\).
1.8.8.5.3.1. Con: For many, the feelings of inadequacy created by comparative poverty are based on the wealth of others being greater than your own, [not just the lack of resources](https://lifehacker.com/feeling-poor-doesnt-stop-once-you-make-money-1782728048). This means that an increase in wages for those paid least would not increase their subjective well-being as a clear hierarchy of wealth remains.
1.8.8.5.3.1.1. Pro: Studies of over 35,300 american adults found that women living in areas of high income inequality are [nearly twice as likely to experience depression](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-income-inequality-idUSBRE99814R20131009), regardless of whether they are themselves poor by economic standards. This suggests that increasing the income of the least wealthy would not protect them from the effects of income inequality on mental health.
1.8.8.5.3.1.2. Con: Even if the full effect of income inequality cannot be avoided, increasing the income of the least wealthy would protect them from the [worst effects](http://www.urban.org/urban-wire/povertys-toll-mental-health) which poverty inflicts on their mental health.
1.8.8.5.3.1.3. Con: While this policy will not eradicate income inequality, it will decrease it. This means that it will at least mitigate unhappiness caused by income inequality.
1.8.8.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: Feelings of distrust created by the injustice of inequality are likely to increase as level of inequality become more extreme.
1.8.8.5.3.1.4. Pro: [Social Comparison Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_comparison_theory) explains that humans have an innate instinct to base the value they place on themselves by comparing themselves to others. Comparing themselves with those who earn more decreases self esteem, even if low earners pay increases so that they have enough to fulfill their needs.
1.8.8.5.3.1.5. Pro: A study of over 53,000 participants over 37 years confirmed that Americans were on average less happy when income inequality was higher [\(Oishi, Kesebir and Diener p.5\)](http://www.factorhappiness.at/downloads/quellen/S13_Oishi.pdf).
1.8.8.5.3.1.5.1. Pro: This study [established](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/income-disparity-makes-people-unhappy.html) that this unhappiness was connected to a sense of unfairness that others earned far more, not a sense of deprivation resulting from those paid least not having enough.
1.8.8.5.3.1.5.2. Pro: The evident injustice of large wealth disparities [undermines](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-income-disparity/income-disparity-causes-unhappiness-study-idUSTRE75F5VG20110616) individuals trust in others, and society in general. This distrust relies on a large inequality existing, regardless of how much those who earn least are paid in absolute terms.
1.8.8.5.3.2. Pro: Wealth disparity increases feelings of sadness for the poorest, because of the feeling of [lack of control which poverty imposes](https://newrepublic.com/article/120859/money-doesnt-buy-happiness-poverty-increases-sadness-study).
1.8.8.5.3.3. Pro: Research suggests that a 1% increase in the share of taxable income being held by the highest 1% of earners [decreases national life satisfaction levels](https://hbr.org/2016/01/income-inequality-makes-whole-countries-less-happy) as much as a 1.4% increase in the national unemployment level.
1.8.8.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.
1.8.8.5.5. Pro: Income inequality in the US has been [linked to prevalence of child maltreatment](http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2013-1707).
1.8.8.5.6. Pro: States with higher measures of income inequality \(Gini-coefficients\) also have higher [prevalance of depression](http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.62.7.710).
1.8.8.5.7. Pro: There is strong evidence that income inequality [causes poorer health](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.12.031) in a population.
1.8.8.5.7.1. Pro: An increase in wealth among some of the population leads to an increase in the products demanded by them at a higher cost. This demand increases relative to supply leads to an [increase in the cost](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2015/06/29/u-s-health-care-costs-rise-faster-than-inflation/#1c43ad916fa1) of medical services.
1.8.8.5.7.1.1. Pro: Despite being the healthiest group in society, the richest American citizens now [spend more than the poorest](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/06/wealthy-spending-more-on-health-care-than-poor-and-middle-class-reversing-trend.html) on medical services. This creates an incentive for providers to tailor services and prices to them.
1.8.8.5.7.1.1.1. Pro: Because medicine is such an essential good, many are willing to go as far as [securing loans](https://www.americanmedicalloan.com/bad-credit/) in order to pay costs. This means that companies [do not lose business](http://time.com/money/4406167/prescription-drug-prices-increase-why/) by increasing the cost of goods to a price which is affordable to the richest.
1.8.8.5.7.1.2. Pro: This is of significant concern because public health insurance provides medical coverage to only [37% of the population.](https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/census-bureau-118395000-government-health-insurance-2015-28966000)
1.8.8.5.7.2. Pro: Wealth inequality leads to political division, as wealthier individuals have [less incentive to support progressive healthcare coverage for less wealthy citizens.](http://www.eclectablog.com/2014/04/why-the-super-rich-hate-obamacare-and-will-never-let-the-debate-die.html)
1.8.8.5.7.2.1. Pro: According to [a 2014 Gallup survey](http://www.gallup.com/poll/168500/half-americans-say-federal-taxes-high.aspx), an increase in wages correlates with the view that taxes are too high. 60% of those earning over $75,000 annually believed that taxes were too high.
1.8.8.5.7.2.2. Pro: The [social divide](https://inequality.org/facts/inequality-and-health/) created by wealth disparity makes individuals less willing to fund the healthcare of those who earn less.
1.8.8.5.7.3. Con: The tax collected from the super rich is necessary to fund healthcare for those who cannot afford it.
1.8.8.5.7.3.1. Pro: In 2014, those earning over $250,000 per annum contributed [51.6%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/13/high-income-americans-pay-most-income-taxes-but-enough-to-be-fair/) of all individual income taxes.
1.8.8.5.7.4. Pro: The poorest quartile of American men live on average [15 years](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/06/wealthy-spending-more-on-health-care-than-poor-and-middle-class-reversing-trend.html) less than the richest.
1.8.8.5.7.5. Pro: In 2015, Americans had to spend an average of [$9,990 per person](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet.html) on health care. This is a fifth of the median income of an entire household according the [United States Census Bureau 2015.](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html) Such high costs mean that some cannot afford the treatments they need.
1.8.8.5.7.5.1. Pro: [19%](http://blogs.plos.org/publichealth/2017/04/19/income-inequality-and-determinants-of-health-in-the-us/) of adults who received prescriptions in 2014 were not able to afford filling them.
1.8.8.5.8. Pro: People should have good lives, and hundreds of millions of dollars in income is not necessary to have a good life. That is more important than Capitalist theories.
1.8.8.5.8.1. Pro: Research indicates that the subjective happiness of people correlates with income only up to about $75,000 USD per year. Beyond that, money can apparently not buy happiness \([Kahneman/Deaton, p. 16491f.](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full.pdf)\).
1.8.8.5.8.1.1. Con: The median household income in the US stands at [around $56,000 USD](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N). This implies that there is plenty of potential for more equality and a redistribution of income from high earners to low earners to increase aggregate happiness in the country.
1.8.8.5.8.2. Con: There isn't a better economic system to pull people out of poverty to date than [capitalism](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21578665-nearly-1-billion-people-have-been-taken-out-extreme-poverty-20-years-world-should-aim).
1.8.8.5.8.3. Con: People should be free to determine for themselves what they need for a good life.
1.8.8.5.8.4. Con: The concept of a "good life" and what it takes to have one is an undefined term heavily dependent upon individual values.
1.8.8.6. Con: Income inequality is a threat to democracy, a key pillar of governance in the US.
1.8.8.6.1. Pro: When the top 1% of earners have a disproportionate amount of a country's wealth, that gives them a disproportionate influence over political power through lobbying and political donations.
1.8.8.6.1.1. Con: This is a problem that arises from the regulation of money's influence in politics, not from the size of payments.
1.8.8.6.1.1.1. Pro: [McCutcheon v. F.E.C.](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/12-536) lawfully abolished campaign contribution limits in 2014. Legislation to reduce undue influence of wealth on politics would rightly begin with challenges to that ruling, rather than legislation to reduce concentrated wealth itself.
1.8.8.6.1.1.2. Con: Until [McCutcheon v. F.E.C.](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/12-536) is successfully challenged, efforts to reduce undue influence of wealth in politics must work around that ruling, and CEO pay caps are but one such measure.
1.8.8.6.1.2. Con: If the top 1% have earned their wealth in a lawful manner, their higher level of influence on politics is fair and represents the proportionate reward for their hard work and earnings.
1.8.8.6.1.2.1. Con: Many of the top 1% inherited their wealth and/or grew up in privileged circumstances that gave them access to opportunities the vast majority of people would never have. This is not a good reason for them to have more influence than everybody else.
1.8.8.6.1.2.2. Pro: The mega-wealthy are people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos - innovators and geniuses.
1.8.8.6.1.2.2.1. Con: A significant number of those [who make up the 1%](http://www.economist.com/node/21543178) are investment bankers, lawyers and managers of financial instruments, people who can hardly be said to produce benefits that society at large profits from.
1.8.8.6.1.2.3. Con: The success of some ultra-wealthy doesn't translate into large benefits for society as a whole.
1.8.8.6.1.2.3.1. Pro: The owners of Walmart may be among the [richest Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_Forbes_400), yet their company pays its employees so little that many of them qualify for food stamps, Medicaid and other taxpayer-funded assistance programs. For Walmart alone, higher wages would [save the government billions](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/files/Taxpayers-and-Walmart-ATF1.pdf).
1.8.8.6.1.2.3.2. Pro: Jeff Bezos may be the second-richest American, yet Amazon has been [accused of](https://ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2017/01/AmazonLaborFactSheet_FINAL.pdf) destroying jobs, providing low-income and insecure employment and harsh working conditions for many of its more than 500.000 employees.
1.8.8.6.1.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.6.1.2.2.1.
1.8.8.6.1.2.4. Con: Lawful doesn't imply fair. Slavery was lawful in the US until 1865.
1.8.8.6.1.2.5. Con: The idea behind democracy is not to represent citizens in accordance with their wealth or earnings or work effort, but to give each citizen the same power regardless of other factors.
1.8.8.6.1.3. Pro: Income inequality causes political parties to shift their platforms to favor wealthy contributors.
1.8.8.6.1.4. Pro: When the wealthy can secure the loyalty of the government through their finances, voters at the polls are unable to correct the imbalance and ensure truly representative officials.
1.8.8.6.1.5. Pro: During the 2016 federal election cycle, [almost a third](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/superpac-donors-2016/) of the money raised by campaigns' super-PACs was given by 23 wealthy donors. In total, these individuals gave $470 million.
1.8.8.6.2. Pro: With increasing inequality, politicians are more able to play certain groups of voters off of others.
1.8.8.6.2.1. Pro: Donald Trump's election has been [characterized](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/04/how_the_gop_is_losing_its_grip_on_working_class_republicans.html) as a working-class revolt against elites.
1.8.8.6.2.1.1. Con: Trump's support was not primarily from the poor and working-class. Trump voters' median income was [higher](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/) than the statewide median income in nearly half of the US states.
1.8.8.6.2.1.2. Con: Even if Trump did draw disproportionate support from the working class, it is purely speculative to suggest that if a CEO salary cap were in place these same voters would not have still voted for Trump.
1.8.8.6.2.2. Pro: Income inequality undermines national unity and popular rule by contributing to a sense of class divide.
1.8.8.6.2.2.1. Pro: The very rich can "[segregate](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195392135.001.0001/acprof-9780195392135-chapter-2) themselves into isolated communities and neighborhoods, use private planes and helicopters to get around, marry and associate only among themselves, raise and educate their children separately from others, and generally develop their own culture and values, paying little attention to others or to the community at large." This undercuts the sense "that citizens are tied together in some way."
1.8.8.6.3. Pro: Income inequality leaves people discontent and generates pressure for income redistribution, which could lead to a scenario of revolution and the creation of a non-democratic but redistributive regime [\(Boix 2003, p.3\)](https://www.princeton.edu/~cboix/book-sample.pdf).
1.8.8.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.6.2.1.
1.8.8.6.3.2. Con: Predictions that income inequality will undermine democratization are "at best weakly supported by the empirical evidence" \([Pengl, p.1](https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/cis-dam/CIS_DAM_2015/WorkingPapers/Living_Reviews_Democracy/Pengl.pdf)\).
1.8.8.6.4. Con: As long as procedural equality still exists, in that all people regardless of class have access to the institutions of government and are protected by the rule of law, income inequality should not be a concern.
1.8.8.6.4.1. Pro: If the state guarantees procedural equality, instead of income equality, it ensures that all persons possess the minimum necessary level of personal freedom to exist in society.
1.8.8.6.4.2. Con: Political equality cannot exist without some degree of economic equality.
1.8.8.6.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.6.1.
1.8.8.6.4.3. Con: It has been argued that America has de-facto [different justice systems](https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/two-in-one-differences-in-the-us-justice-system-for-the-rich-and-the-poor) for the rich and the poor. For example the former can hire expensive lawyers whereas the latter are dependent on over-worked court-appointed counsel.
1.8.8.6.5. Pro: Wealth can buy political influence, thus great inequality results in unequal political influence, undermining the foundations of any democracy.
1.8.8.6.5.1. Pro: Extreme wealth is economically inefficient. Laws, such as rules against perpetuity, have been changed in many states so that generation after generation inherit family fortunes and do not have to participate \(e.g. work\) and add to society.
1.8.8.6.5.1.1. Con: The complex tax structures are allowed by law, the government could change those laws via the same method it would cap compensation.
1.8.8.6.5.1.1.1. Pro: [This article](https://hbr.org/2017/08/its-time-to-tie-executive-compensation-to-sustainability) demonstrates how executive compensation metrics can be used to spur change on an economic scale that benefits the whole society.
1.8.8.6.5.1.2. Con: The investment vehicles that wealthy individuals and families utilize do contribute to the economy as they provide the capital for new and existing businesses to grow, hire employees, purchase equipment, etc.
1.8.8.6.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.8.8.6.5.1.3. Con: High-income executives pay higher taxes on their income; thus there would be a loss of tax revenue, requiring increased taxes on the lower and middle classes.
1.8.8.6.5.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.8.8.6.5.1.1.
1.8.8.6.5.1.4. Pro: Not reinvesting profits in the economy worsens economic disparity. The problem is like a snowball, and to simply let CEOs collect ever bigger bonuses will lead to runaway corporate greed.
1.8.8.6.5.2. Con: The areas where this is most likely to occur are in industries that are over regulated and competition is limited.  A company that engorges its executives with high pay, regardless of productivity, shouldn't be able to compete with a lean, efficient company in the long run.
1.8.8.6.5.3. Pro: Those at the top basically have the power to set their own salaries and awards \(bonuses, stock options, etc\) as the approval comes from a board of directors with which they are friends. Clear conflicts of interest exist, which only reward those at the top
1.8.8.6.5.3.1. Pro: In this Planet Money [episode](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/07/19/538141248/episode-594-board-games), two shareholders discuss their struggle in lowering the CEO's pay.
1.8.8.6.5.4. Pro: The rich can use their money and connections to lobby politicians to get loopholes which benefit them.
1.8.8.6.5.4.1. Pro: [Research has suggested](http://www.oecd.org/cleangovbiz/toolkit/50101671.pdf) that lobbying relating to financial institutions and facilitating risky lending behaviour may have been a primary cause in the most recent financial crash in the USA.
1.8.8.6.5.5. Pro: Most corporate charters allow companies to count stock proxies in favour of management. When management votes on its own pay, the deck is heavily stacked in its favour.
1.8.8.7. Con: -> See 1.8.7.
1.8.9. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.
1.8.10. Pro: If companies are honest and non-coercive and respect basic working rights, they should be allowed to compensate their employees in the manner that they choose.
1.8.11. Pro: In a market society, the market determined salary of a job functions as a signal, measuring the importance of that job. Government interference leads to a distortion of these signals, and therefore an inefficient distribution of resources.
1.8.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.8.3.
1.8.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.7.
1.8.11.3. Pro: Government interference with the free market system can easily open the door to further restrictions and control of companies in production, pricing, and ability to compete.
1.8.11.3.1. Con: Incorporated companies are themselves antithetical to a "free market" as they limit the liability of those engaging in transactions. Given the government grants privileges to companies, and that companies voluntarily incorporate, it has every right to interfere with corporate governance. Indeed they already do on such issues such as accountancy transparency, shareholder rights and so on.
1.8.11.3.2. Con: The suggested adaption is nothing other than a self-adjusting minimum wage, thus it wouldn't be breaking this non-control limitation.

That is to say, it makes each company's minimum wage contingent to its maximum wage, and thus the size and economic power of the company determines its minimum wage, also ensuring a balance of benefit.

Therefore, this does not, in fact, violate the principle 'the law should control no more than the minimum wage', as this is exactly what such a cap does.
1.8.11.3.3. Con: The government already regulates many industries, such as [the meat industry](https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/lawsenforcedbyfda/ucm148693.htm) for example. [It used to be individuals did not know if they were eating, pork, beef, or poison](http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/sinclair/ch14.html). If one wants to say that government should not have a role in how businesses can conduct themselves, then it is necessary to roll back those protections well.
1.8.11.3.4. Con: This argument is guilty of the slippery slope fallacy. If the government were to consider regulating production \(although for farming, it already does\), or pricing, there would be debate then as well where we can decide those issues.
1.8.11.4. Pro: Given the government's inability to even balance its own budget, it is not competent to interfere in the private sector
1.8.11.4.1. Con: Government incompetence does not apply. The legislature was designed to be slow \(and somewhat incompetent\) to prevent poor or unjust laws from passing. The executive branch, however, is designed and currently works fairly competently in enforcing the law. Since the only government intervention in this policy is enforcement, the government would be competent in that regard.
1.8.11.4.2. Con: The goverment does a lot of things right, from dialysis, to food safety. It also provides education, infrastructure such as energy, communication and transport, a legal system with laws to protect citizens' rights and ensure citizens uphold the laws, and healthcare. Even if these systems are flawed, and most of them actually work quite well, they are still beneficial to millions of people every day.
1.8.11.4.3. Con: The government is not a business, its goal isn't to run a profit, or even to break even, it exists for the sole goal of serving the people.
1.8.11.4.3.1. Con: The accumulation of losses does eventually do harm to the people as more and more money flows into interest payments and is not available for public causes.
1.8.11.4.3.1.1. Pro: Every year, the United States spends [about 6%](https://www.thebalance.com/interest-on-the-national-debt-4119024) of its federal budget on interest payments for debt. This is [more than](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/) is spent on science, energy and the environment, and transportation combined.
1.8.11.4.3.1.1.1. Con: The cost of repaying the national debt is equal to the cost of paying the interest indefinitely, because the interest is calculated to be equal to the inflation rate.
1.8.11.4.3.1.1.2. Con: A large amount of the national debt is owned by the national government.
1.8.11.4.3.1.1.3. Con: As long as people trust the US government to pay its debts, which they do, and value low risk investments, which they do, we can borrow without limit.
1.8.11.4.3.1.2. Con: Government bonds are a stable investment that are important to our economy, especially as a stable saving method for retirement, but to have bonds, you have to have debt, and to have an economy as large as the US's you need a lot of bonds, so you need a lot of debt.
1.8.11.4.3.1.3. Con: A certain amount of debt makes an effective monetary tool for regulating the money supply.
1.8.11.5. Con: The very existence of the free market is [dependent upon](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4398578?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) a degree of government control.
1.8.11.5.1. Pro: Markets that are not regulated by state interference have tendencies, for example [towards monopolies](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/05/joseph-stiglitz-are-markets-efficient-or-do-they-tend-towards-monopoly-the-verdict-is-in/), that can undermine their own functioning.
1.8.11.5.2. Pro: Without the state to enforce property laws, everyone could just steal whatever they wanted when they wanted it.
1.8.11.6. Con: The "free market system," as an absolute, results in a wide number of undesirable outcomes, some examples being widespread poverty, stagnating monopolies, health issues, and many more. Regulation is required to keep the economy healthy and competitive as well as secure the well-being of the people.
1.8.11.7. Con: The labor market for even skilled workers can almost always be treated as super-saturated, labor can't get a price representative of the product they provide.
1.8.12. Con: The idea of the [company as an entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood) with rights and privileges is a creation of the state, therefore the state is perfectly entitled to interfere with the framework they have created.
1.8.12.1. Pro: Since a corporation is a legal person \(and hence a legal fiction made possible by the tacit approval of the public\), the public should be able to edit this legal fiction. One such edit would be capping the pay of corporate officers.
1.8.12.2. Con: A company is just people organizing in a certain way. The rights of the company are just the rights of those individuals. The state should not interfere with the rights of individuals, thus it should not cap their wages.
1.8.12.2.1. Con: It is established legal perspective to treat companies as if they have independent [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood). The rights of a corporation are completely distinct from the rights of its employees and owners.
1.8.12.3. Pro: Because the government has an interest in pursuing the overall good of society, they already supervise and regulate certain aspects of corporate compensation. They would be justified in continuing to do so.
1.8.12.3.1. Pro: The federal government as well as several state governments [mandate a minimum wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States). If the government can mandate a minimum wage, there is no reason why it cannot mandate a maximum wage.
1.8.12.3.1.1. Con: The minimum wage is [supposed to](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/minimum_wage) protect those who have little bargaining power and ensure a minimum living standard for them. In contrast to that, a wage cap does not help to protect the weak and poor and is thus not justified.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1. Con: While a minimum wage protects workers from being exploited by an employer who would otherwise offer a lower wage, the large disparity in wages between the lowest and highest paid employee in a company is part of the problem of income inequality.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Salary caps would reduce income inequality, which society as a whole would benefit from.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.5.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This type of utilitarian logic \(i.e. society would benefit\) followed to its conclusion leads to different types of programs that people would find deplorable \(e.g. killing healthy people to give their organs to 4 or 5 people that need those organs\).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: It is possible to support a salary cap for utilitarian reasons, while opposing other policies that would also follow utilitarian logic \(e.g. killing people to use their organs\), on the basis that the cost to the organ donor \(i.e. death\) is too high.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Income inequality can be good for society.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.6.1.2.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.3.3. Pro: The existence of the very rich and apparent class divides can increase civic and social solidarity, if people are motivated to work harder to improve their status and advance to a higher class.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.8.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.7.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.3.4. Con: The benefits of inequality usually relate to how it might cause people to aspire wealth in the future - a hypothetical, by no means assured benefit. In the present day, there is nothing positive about some people having a lot of wealth while others have little, oftentimes without a fault of their own.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.6.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Insofar as income inequality arises naturally, under non-exploitative conditions, it should not be corrected through state redistribution.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Wage caps would punish those with great talent who are rewarded through high wages.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: Individuals should be free to pursue their own self-interests as long as they do not harm others and/or society in the process.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.8.5.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.6.1.2.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.4.3. Con: Even if income inequality arises naturally in the abstract, given that huge amounts of the world's current wealth was initially obtained through violence \(colonialism, war, etc.\), it would be wrong to suggest that the current distribution of wealth is the result of non-exploitative conditions. The state therefore has every right to redistribute.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.4.3.1. Con: Since governments were responsible for past exploitative conditions, it would be unwise to trust even democratic states with extensive control over things like private wages.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.4.4. Con: Inequality does not arise naturally; it is [largely inherited](https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21640316-children-rich-and-powerful-are-increasingly-well-suited-earning-wealth-and-power) and reproduced through generations. The wealthy and powerful of today produce offspring that are likely to be wealthy and powerful, too.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.4.5. Con: Just because a phenomenon arises naturally does not mean that it cannot be harmful to democracy and should thus not be dealt with.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.4.5.1. Pro: Low voter turnout in elections can be perceived as a natural phenomenon as the individual vote usually does not matter, yet it represents a problem for democracy.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.4.5.2. Pro: Uninformed voters can be seen as a natural consequence of the fact that citizens have few incentives to inform themselves. Yet this represents a problem for democracies.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.5. Con: Actually, it would increase income inequality. It would not take away any money from enormously wealthy individuals and dynastic families, but would limit the income of the high ranking executives \(and others such as athletes\) creating a permanent caste system of existing billionaires and everybody else.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: But if the income of the enormously wealthy were to be limited when maximum wage came into effect \(if it did\), then the extra money being redistributed elsewhere would slowly increase/balance income equality over time. The amount in the bank account isn't limited, only the income is. This would result in the extinction of caste systems over time. Extra money goes to building society, not necessarily straight to low-income individuals - they do need to earn it.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.5.2. Con: Of course, we could simply enact an effective wealth tax to counteract this issue at the same time
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.6.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.7. Pro: In the face of the existing inequality in the US, the high wages of executives are immoral.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.8. Con: Inequality shouldn't be assumed to be a problem. An individual's concern should be about whether his/her own livelihood is improving at an acceptable rate. Comparison to another's situation is a red herring to the issue of poverty.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.8.1. Pro: The actual problem with inequality is how many wealthy individuals spend their money: on lavish luxury. If this money would be invested or spent for public or social purposes, inequality would not be problematic.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.8.2. Con: Society benefits from reducing inequality to the extent that it reduces poverty. Assuming total income stays constant, reducing inequality raises the income of those on the low end while reducing income of those at the top.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.9. Con: The measure wouldn't raise low wages: They pay the market price for all wages and if they paid less for the CEO, they wouldn't pay more for other wages since they also are determined by the market.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.10. Con: A salary cap would not address the cultural causes of income inequality.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.11. Con: According to a [report by UNU-WIDER,](https://www.wider.unu.edu/news/press-release-global-income-inequality-has-declined-relative-terms-gone-substantially-absolute) the relative income inequality has been going down. There is an important distinction between relative and absolute inequality. In a poor country, where one man makes 100 units an hour and another makes 10, the absolute inequality is 90, and the relative is 10. If the country suddenly gets wealthy, line if oil is discovered, they might make 1000 and 500. Absolute inequality has gone up drastically, while relative inequality has gone down by a factor of two.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12. Con: Income inequality is just one problem among others. The US should first focus on alleviating poverty and disadvantage.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.1. Pro: As long as everybody has the financial resources to live the life he/she has reason to value, it does not matter how much other people earn in relative terms.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.2. Pro: The best way to reduce poverty is private investment in the economy, which is only possible if some people earn enough to save a lot. Wealthy people, wether they save or consume, help against poverty. So fightning inequality is not only less important than fightning poverty - it actually prevents fighting poverty to a degree.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.2.1. Pro: Wealthy people tend to create own businesses and invest their money directly \(not only through savings\).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.2.2. Pro: Investment leads to cheaper production of needed goods, which increases the purchasing power of the poor.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.2.3. Pro: Wealthy people create employment for poor people through the investment or even by consuming certain goods.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.3. Pro: High incomes lead to diminishing returns. Just because one person earns ten times the income of another person does not mean that the first person is living a life ten times as good as that of the other person, or even ten times as well-off.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.5.8.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.3.2. Con: Those diminishing returns means that this extra income is being used inefficiently. The person earning ten times less income would gain more utility from more income, so we should explore policy options that can help to alter this distribution.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.4. Con: Income equality is an expression of disadvantage as those with very high incomes, e.g. business executives, usually profit from various advantages.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.6.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.4.2. Pro: Research suggests that entrepreneurs often share a set of specific traits. They tend to be male, white, from wealthy, educated and stable families, and with particular personality characteristics \([Levine/Rubenstein, p. 21-24](https://www.nber.org/papers/w19276.pdf?new_window=1)\).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.5. Con: While a serious problem in its own right \(and one often connected to inequality\), poverty is a separate problem to inequality. Inequality can have negative effects even if poverty rates are low, and it is thus not enough to tackle poverty alone.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.5.1. Con: More than 13% of the American population currently live in poverty. To argue that inequality can exist even without poverty thus may be true in theory but has little to do with American realities \([Census Bureau, p. 12](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.pdf)\).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.6. Con: Other methods besides salary caps are more effective at reducing poverty.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.6.1. Pro: Increasing job training and job assistance programs \(whether funded by the company or the government\) would help workers earn a sustainably higher salary, even if they change jobs or companies.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.6.1.1. Pro: Classical [marginal productivity theory](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/14299/labour-markets/factors-that-explain-wage-inequality/) explains wage inequality as a result of differences in worker skill and qualifications.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.6.2. Pro: Increasing the minimum wage would do more to improve the circumstances of the lowest paid regardless of how much a particular company chooses to pay its executives.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.6.2.1. Pro: Raising the federal minimum wage to $15, as politicians such as Bernie Sanders [propose](https://berniesanders.com/issues/a-living-wage/), would mean that about 42% of American workers would receive a raise \([NELP, p. 1](http://www.nelp.org/content/uploads/Growing-Movement-for-15-Dollars.pdf)\).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.6.2.2. Pro: [A majority](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/04/5-facts-about-the-minimum-wage/) of Americans wants a federal minimum wage of $15; the general idea of raising the minimum wage is supported by [three out of four](http://www.people-press.org/2015/12/22/as-election-year-nears-public-sees-mixed-economic-picture/majority-supports-increase-in-federal-minimum-wage/) Americans.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.6.3. Con: Other methods can be used in conjunction with the proposed method in order to effect greater change. It is not an either/or scenario.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.6.4. Con: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.12.5.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.13. Con: This policy tackles income inequality within a company only. If it increases unemployment, it will increase overall national inequality.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14. Pro: The salary differences in the US are excessively large.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.1. Pro: The international perspective emphasizes that America has a problematic level of income inequality: [no other](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/income-inequality.htm) rich nation has a higher Gini-coefficient than the U.S. \(with Turkey, Costa Rica and Mexico being the only exceptions among developed nations\).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.2. Con: Most executives make approximately [five times](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000) the median salary of US workers. The targeted sampling of only the [largest companies](http://www.equilar.com/reports/46-equilar-100-highest-paid-ceos-2017.html) in the US results in numbers being skewed much higher.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.3. Con: Labeling something as excessive is highly subjective and arbitrary.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.4. Pro: The difference between the pay of CEOs and workers of major companies is [larger than](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-16/ranking-where-to-work-to-be-a-rich-ceo-or-richer-than-neighbors) in most other countries.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.4.1. Con: Studies that compare the pay of US executives with those in other countries, and that take into account the structure of pay, find that American executives do not receive significantly higher compensations \([Murphy, p. 123](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2041679)\).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.5. Pro: According to estimates, [at least 85%](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/ceo-pay-ratio/) of the companies in the S&P 500 index pay their CEOs more than 35-times as much as the median workers. The difference between the CEO's pay and the lowest-paid employee must be even larger.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.7. Pro: Compensation for US corporate executives is rising faster than compensation for the average worker.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.7.1. Pro: From 1978 to 2014, inflation-adjusted CEO compensation [increased](http://www.epi.org/publication/top-ceos-make-300-times-more-than-workers-pay-growth-surpasses-market-gains-and-the-rest-of-the-0-1-percent/) 997% while the typical worker's annual compensation only grew by 10.9% over the same period.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.7.2. Pro: According to the [Economic Policy Institute](http://www.epi.org/publication/top-ceos-make-300-times-more-than-workers-pay-growth-surpasses-market-gains-and-the-rest-of-the-0-1-percent/), the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio in the United States peaked at 376:1 in 2000 and was 303:1 in 2014. In 1965, the ratio was more reasonable, at 20:1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.7.3. Pro: In 2016, average compensation for the 200 highest-paid executives in the US [increased](http://www.equilar.com/reports/49-equilar-200-ranking-the-largest-ceo-pay-pakages-2017.html) 16%  over what they received in 2015, to $19.3 million. The average compensation of the new top 200 highest-paid executives rose even more in 2017, to $19.7 million.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.8. Pro: The income inequality between the top 5% of households in the US and the bottom 95% has been steadily growing over the past decades. As this trend is poised to continue, intervention is urgently necessary before things become even worse \([Census Bureau, p. 31-35](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.pdf)\).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.15. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.8.2.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16. Pro: As reported in Thomas Piketty's Capital, "two-thirds of the increase in American income inequality over the last four decades" can be attributed to [the rise in wages](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/business/executive-pay-invasion-of-the-supersalaries.html) for top earners.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.1. Con: Piketty only refers to income numbers but leaves taxation out of the equation. In terms of [after-tax incomes](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/income-growth-and-income-inequality-the-facts-may-surprise-you/), 99% of the population have seen their income grow between 2000 and 2010, and Americans with low income more so than those with high income.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.1.1. Con: These numbers are partly the result of historical circumstance: the recession of 2007/8 is taken into account. In terms of after-tax income [from 1979 to 2010](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/income-growth-and-income-inequality-the-facts-may-surprise-you/), Americans with high income have seen more growth than those with low income, and no one has seen more growth than the top 1% of earners.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.1.2. Con: The most [recent research](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/8/16112368/piketty-saez-zucman-income-growth-inequality-stagnation-chart) by Saez, Piketty, and Zucman does in fact take taxes into account, along with other common objections to Piketty's research. It is quite thorough in its scope.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.2. Con: The wages of executives and management should grow faster, as they are the ones responsible for growing businesses and, by extension, the economy at large.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3. Pro: Companies would either reduce the pay of their highest-paid executives, increase the pay of the lowest-paid employees, or some combination. Either way, inequality would decline.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.1. Con: Companies may outsource cheap labor to other countries which would reduce the number of American jobs, thereby increasing unemployment.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.1.1. Con: Outsourcing is already endemic and will be replaced by more automation. Unlimited CEO salaries has not stemmed this path.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.1.2. Con: If the company has not outsourced their cheap labor already, it's because the costs outweigh the benefits. It seems unlikely that they would incur those costs just for the privilege of paying their CEO more.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.1.3. Con: If the umbrella concept was applied, meaning that companies doing work on behalf of the company's primary function, then this cheap labor would then potentially bring down the income of the top earners. This would then provide an incentive for them to employ higher earners within the U.S.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.2. Con: US companies may relocate to be based in other countries.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.2.1. Con: For many stores \(such as retailers, manufacturers or superstores like Wal-Mart\), it is necessary to have employees from the U.S. A salary cap could help this large population of employees.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.3. Con: Companies would be incentivized to reduce overall payroll through increased automation.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.3.1. Pro: Increasing automation would reduce the number of jobs, increasing unemployment and putting the lowest-skilled, lowest-paid workers in a worse position than they were in before.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.3.2. Con: This trend is inevitable. Costs of automation have been decreasing over time, as technologies and AI become more advanced and more established.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.3.3. Con: There are ways to compensate for this such as Universal Basic Income and expanded welfare nets.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4. Con: Corporations can compensate their highest-paid employees in ways that circumvent the salary cap.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.1. Con: The fact that the wealthy may be able to circumvent a policy is not reason enough to reject the policy outright, as it could still provide marginal benefit.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.1.1. Con: Having to concede such a public step towards egalitarianism will make conservatives more determined to prevent future measures. It is a waste to use this political capital on a policy which will be ineffective.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: This policy is a radical and public step, so much so that when it was suggested in Portland, it was considered an ineffective ["media stunt"](http://fortune.com/2016/12/08/portland-ceo-pay-tax-explainer/).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.1.2. Pro: The wealthy often circumvent their legal tax obligation through loopholes, but that is not an argument that they ought not be taxed or taxed at a lower rate; that just means the law should be better enforced and updated regularly.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: Taxation law must be reactive to loopholes by introducing laws at regular intervals to reduce lawful tax minimisation schemes.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.1.2.2. Con: It is often the corporations/lobbyists that influence these tax updates in order to more favor themselves. Concentrating broad discretionary taxing authority in a central decision-making body incentivizes companies to lobby to game the system.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.1.3. Con: Companies may change to compensating their executives in less economically efficient ways, resulting in a lower overall efficiency of the economy, cancelling out such marginal benefits.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.1.3.1. Pro: Part of the reason for the US's [inefficient healthcare system](http://www.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/199334/report-healthcare-america-grossly-inefficient.aspx) was, during WWII, wage controls were put in place by government as part of rationing efforts. Therefore, to pay employees more without violating strict wage controls, companies began offering health insurance. This eventually led to government encouraging employer-provided health insurance, leading to the problems we had where people's health insurance disappeared if they happened to become unemployed.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.2. Pro: Companies can defer payment of compensation until the executive’s retirement when the salary cap will no longer apply. High-paid employees will find ways to receive the same total compensation, just with different timing and new loopholes as the law and tax code evolves.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.1.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.2.2. Con: If companies use loopholes to evade a salary cap, it would be possible to amend the law to cover such loopholes or base the cap on total compensation received rather than solely on salary received.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.3. Pro: Many American CEOs have [salaries of $1](http://money.cnn.com/gallery/news/companies/2013/08/06/one-dollar-salaries/index.html) but receive total compensation \(through stock options and bonuses\) in the tens of millions. Given this tendency to skirt the rules, even a cap on total compensation would likely result in CEOs finding new ways to increase their benefits and non-monetary compensation.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.3.1. Con: In the last decade, efforts to increase bookkeeping transparency in companies has helped to [cut down](http://time.com/money/4227915/ceo-pay-inflated-by-stock-options/) the use of alternative compensation for CEOs e.g. stock options that increase regardless of performance.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.2.2.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.3.3. Pro: Some companies already provide [lifestyle compensation](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/8-ceo-perks-that-will-make-you-angry-2016-01-28) to CEOs, including paying for private school tuition for children, a country club membership, and a private plane \(or car and driver\) available for personal and family use. These incentives would likely increase if salaries were capped.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.4. Con: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.2.2.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.5. Con: A cap based on the salary of the lowest-paid worker would not cause companies to increase the compensation for these workers.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.5.1. Pro: If forced to increase the salary of their lowest-paid workers, companies may reduce the non-salary compensation \(e.g. healthcare, paid leave\) that they provide. This would harm lowest-paid workers more, and further entrench economic inequality.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.5.2. Pro: Companies may respond by firing their lowest-paid workers, rather than increasing their salaries.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.5.2.1. Con: Under this policy, companies would not be able to simply replace these workers at an equal or lesser cost, as the ratio constraints would still apply to the replacement employees.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.5.2.2. Con: It seems likely that each company will need to retain at least some lower paid workers. In order to avoid dramatically decreasing the income of those paid most, it must significantly increase the wages of the lower paid workers who remain with the company.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17. Con: Other mechanisms to reduce inequality are more effective.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.1.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2. Pro: Increasing the minimum wage would reduce income inequality.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.1. Con: At the 2013 level of [pay inequality](http://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-continues-to-rise/,) \(1008:1 between average CEO and a full-time minimum wage worker\), doubling the minimum wage \(and keeping the high-end constant\) only reduces pay inequality to 554:1. This policy proposes capping pay inequality at 35:1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.2. Pro: Increasing the minimum wage increases the cost of production, and therefore the price, of various goods. As low-income workers' wages are increasing, the purchasing power of the wealthier is declining, reducing inequality.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.2.1. Con: A rise in prices is regressive, and thus disproportionally hurts low-income people, thus increasing the practical effects of inequality.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.3. Pro: When a company increases the minimum wage, their profits declines. This reduces the income of the stakeholders \(typically, wealthy investors\), as the incomes of the low-wage workers are increasing.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.4. Con: Increases in inflation would undermine the benefits of a higher minimum wage by making it less and less beneficial over time.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.4.1. Con: The minimum wage can be indexed for inflation.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.4.2. Pro: The value of the minimum wage has [declined](http://www.epi.org/publication/given-the-economys-growth-the-federal-minimum-wage-could-be-significantly-higher/) 24% since 1968. Adjustments for cost of living and inflation have proven insufficient.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.4.3. Con: Even if inflation poses a problem for a minimum wage, a higher minimum wage is still better for those affected as well as for society-wide inequality than a lower minimum wage.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.5. Con: Increasing the minimum wage, even doubling it, as is commonly proposed, will have less impact on inequality than will capping the ceiling of compensation.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.6. Con: Minimum wage laws disincentivize the [creation of unskilled jobs](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2014/beyond-bls/determining-the-employment-effect-of-raising-the-minimum-wage.htm), which increases unemployment among the poor and increases income inequality.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.6.1. Pro: In 2007, a [study](http://www.nber.org/papers/w12663.pdf) carried out a review of more than 100 studies on minimum wage laws and unemployment in the US. They found the research consistently pointed to minimum wage laws increasing unemployment, particularly for the lowest skilled groups of workers.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.2.6.2. Pro: Despite some criticism of research showing a link between minimum wage laws and unemployment, the [majority of the research to date](http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2015/december/effects-of-minimum-wage-on-employment/) supports that minimum wage laws in the USA increase unemployment, and that this link is stronger for two groups: young people and low-skilled workers.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.3. Pro: If the main concern here is wealth inequality, there are more effective measures that could be taken rather than curbing wages. For example, implementing a wealth tax or a higher tax on extremely high income earners.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.4. Pro: Both the introduction of a minimum wage, and this proposal for a maximum wage, are measures to patch up a fundamentally broken economic system. While these patches are preferable to doing nothing, a better solution would be to analyse the source of faults within the current system and a drastic overhaul to address the problems.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.5. Pro: The policy proposed here would target the top 1% of earners. Yet the actual catalyst of inequality is not the widening gap between the 1% and the 99%, but between the top 20% and the rest of American society.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.5.1. Pro: From 1967 to 2015, the mean income of the lowest-earning 80% of American society increased on average by 24%. Over the same period, the mean income of the top 20% of earners increased by 84% \([Census Bureau, p. 31, 35](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.pdf)\).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.5.1.1. Pro: Most of the growth in incomes during the past decades for  the top quintile of American earners went [to the lower 19%](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/opinion/sunday/stop-pretending-youre-not-rich.html); it is by no means only the top 1% that profited.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.5.1.1.1. Con: That still leaves the other 80% of Americans behind.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.5.2. Pro: If companies decide to lower the salaries of their highest paid employees such as CEOs, then it follows that those with the next level of influence within these companies will be the ones to benefit. That is, CEOs might earn less, but other reasonably high level executives and managers will earn more, decreasing inequality within the top 20%, but not helping out those most in need.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.8.2.1.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.6. Con: Other mechanisms require more political capital to be enacted and will provoke more opposition. As salary caps affect only a relatively small number of people, they are easier to implement.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.8. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.17.9. Con: Implementing salary caps will make it easier to pass other sorts of legislation which address inequality. A progressive tax, for instance, is easier to pass when executives and owners are making less money and pouring less into lobbying and special interest groups.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18. Pro: Income inequality is inefficient and harms the economy.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.6.5.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.2. Pro: Salaries that are unlinked to performance or productivity are [economic rents and cause upwards wealth accumulation](http://cepr.net/documents/working-paper-upward-distribution-income-rents.pdf). That is to say that the economic value placed on high earning CEOs outweighs that of the resulting product
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.3. Con: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.8.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.4. Pro: High income inequality [makes it more difficult](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-income-inequality-undermines-us-power/2014/11/28/53fab4e4-74e5-11e4-9d9b-86d397daad27_story.html?utm_term=.0a0daeebda9b) for America to exercise its influence abroad as its society and economy become ever less attractive for outsiders.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5. Pro: Income inequality has been linked to lower economic growth. If the share of income of the top 20% in societies increases, this harms economic growth. If the share of income of the bottom 20% increases, growth profits \([IMF, p. 5/6](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)\).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5.2. Con: It is unclear why CEO pay will not simply be lowered, and the money which would have been paid as remuneration to them not simply returned to shareholders as dividends. If this occurs, than this policy will do nothing to increase the income of the bottom 20%, meaning that no benefit is accrued.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5.2.1. Pro: Very little redistribution to lower earners will occur because shareholders are very unlikely to be among the lowest 20% of earners.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5.2.1.1. Pro: Often shareholders of the largest firms are themselves institutions. For example, over 79% of Goldman Sachs shares are held by [institutions](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GS/holders?p=GS). Increasing the income of these institutions does nothing to redistribute the wealth to those earning less.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5.2.1.2. Pro: As a company creates more wealth, a portion of that money is given to shareholders as [dividends](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp). This amount is decided by the board of directors, elected by shareholders. This means that the amount given to directors and CEOs is unlikely to be more than that made by large shareholders.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5.2.1.3. Pro: Becoming a shareholder requires the initial investment of [purchasing shares](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp). In companies which can afford to pay their top earners very high wages, it is likely that those who can afford to purchases shares are equally if not more wealthy.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5.2.2. Con: Top earning CEOs currently earn [300](http://fortune.com/2015/06/22/ceo-vs-worker-pay/) times that of the average worker in their companies. In order to maintain the income of those paid least, companies would have to reduce the pay of CEOs to just over a tenth of their current earnings to fulfill a 1:35 ratio.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5.2.2.1. Pro: It would be a radical step to only adjust the wages of those paid most, as their pay would have to be reduced so significantly. Rather, companies are likely to react by changing pay at both ends[\(David Roth\)](http://www.businessinsider.com/switzerlands-112-initiative-why-executives-are-worried-2013-11?IR=T).
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5.2.2.2. Pro: Any increase in wages to those paid least would allow for a far larger benefit to those paid most, as they can earn 35 times as much as their co-workers. Thus even small increases will lead to avoiding a lot of resentment and anger on behalf of CEOs.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5.2.3. Con: Shareholders have influence over the company, but this does not translate into the control necessary to effect this change. They own the company, but they don't run it. They have some say, but it is important for them to keep the CEO happy.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.6. Pro: The [law of diminishing marginal utility](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingutility.asp) suggests that the more of something somebody has, the less utility they get out of each extra unit of that thing. This means less income inequality would produce more aggregate utility as a poorer individual would get more out an extra one hundred dollars income than a wealthier individual.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.6.2. Con: It is unclear why aggregate utility should trump the fact that wealthier individuals worked for, earned, and hence deserve, their extra income.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.2.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.6.2.2. Con: In reality, although a large proportion of CEO pay is derived form bonuses, [these do not fluctuate based on performance.](https://hbr.org/1990/05/ceo-incentives-its-not-how-much-you-pay-but-how) This means that it is an arbitrary allocation of money, not a reward for value created for the company by the CEO.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.6.2.3. Con: The functioning of each company depends on the labour of the least paid as much as the most. It is unfair to allow the remuneration of that labour be taken from the company profits and the wages of the least paid and given to CEOs.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.6.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.7.8.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.6.2.4. Pro: Considering the [high levels of taxation](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/13/high-income-americans-pay-most-income-taxes-but-enough-to-be-fair/) paid by those earning above $250,000 per anum, it is unjust for the state to go further and deny them wages which they earned, and paid tax on.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.6.3. Pro: While lower-income people tend to spend most of the money they have, the rich will often take it out of circulation and into [offshore bank accounts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth/super-rich-hold-32-trillion-in-offshore-havens-idUSBRE86L03U20120722), where it will remain unused, potentially forever.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.6.4. Con: The law of diminishing marginal utility is a very strong argument against all kinds of price floors and ceilings, which are used to try and re-distribute wealth.  It suggests that prices/values are not fixed, but fluid, situational, and based on individual preference.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.6.5. Pro: We can see this by looking at the [the relationship between consumption and disposable income.](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/macro-economics/income-and-employment/relationship-between-disposable-income-and-consumption/32743/)
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.19. Con: Wealth inequality is a [much more significant contributor](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/09/where-the-rich-make-their-income.html) to economic inequality in the US than income inequality.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.19.1. Pro: While income inequality in the US is on the level of other rich nations, wealth inequality is [considerably higher](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/05/21/the-top-10-of-americans-own-76-of-the-stuff-and-its-dragging-our-economy-down/?utm_term=.8756b5d47b0c). The top 10% of households earn earn 28% of the income - and they own 76% of all wealth in the country.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.19.2. Pro: Wealth inequality is based on return from capital rather than income, and as such this policy does little to tackle it.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.19.3. Con: Tackling income inequality via salary caps does not preclude the tackling of wealth inequality. One does not have to come at the cost of the other.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.19.3.1. Con: You can't tackle all of the income inequality without tackling wealth inequality. Because much income comes from owning wealth, that is called capital.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.19.4. Con: Income inequality leads to wealth inequality. The two measures can therefore hardly be separated. One way to tackle wealth inequality is by tackling income inequality.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.19.4.1. Con: Income inequality does not only measure wages for employees, but also earnings. That is income that does not come from wages, but from owning capital.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20. Pro: Linking the highest wages paid to the lowest in a company will result in the lowest paid employees' wages increasing significantly. Doing so would become necessary so as not to dramatically reduce the pay of those on top.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.1. Con: -> See 1.8.7.7.1.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.2. Con: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.5.2.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.3. Pro: Typically CEOs act as [inside directors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors). This means that they, as employees who are awarded [executive pay,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_compensation) sit on the board which makes managerial decisions for the company.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.3.1. Pro: This means that they have a strong personal incentive to increase the wages of those paid least in order to maintain their own.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.3.2. Con: The Board of Directors have a legal duty to be [independent.](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/cgri-quick-guide-03-board-directors-duties-liabilities.pdf) This means that they must act in the interest of the company alone. To act in their own self interest is in breach of this.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.4. Con: A study of over 2,500 CEOs found that their income, including salary and bonus, was [not affected](https://hbr.org/1990/05/ceo-incentives-its-not-how-much-you-pay-but-how) by how their decisions affected the company. It may be in companies' interest to reduce this expenditure rather than incur further cost by increasing the income of the lowest paid staff.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.5. Con: In [a study](http://www.epi.org/files/pdf/130354.pdf) of the largest 350 companies in the United States, the average compensation for a CEO is over $15 million. The 35:1 ratio would mean that the minimum salary at those companies would be $400,000. Even if you were to try to get to reduce the highest-to-lowest ratio by lowering the top and raising the bottom, there is no formula that would get you to 35:1 without either losing the CEO or exploding the payroll.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.5.1. Con: It is more likely that companies will respond by both lowering executive salary and raising the minimum salary to levels that keep the executives happy but also improve the lives of workers at the bottom.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.5.2. Con: Since this would be implemented as a law, the impetus would apply equally to CEOs of every company. You would be "losing the CEO" to another company with the same conditions imposed on them. The companies who paid CEOs the best, would also be forced to pay employees at a scale proportional to the value of the company and its profitability. CEOs would therefore migrate to companies which compensated all their employees fairly.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.6. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.
1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.7. Pro: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.18.5.2.2.
1.8.12.3.1.2. Con: Simple ability to do something is not an argument for doing something.
1.8.12.3.2. Con: Given Public Choice economics \(the study of understanding government action from an economics perspective\), it has clearly been demonstrated that governments often act in the interest of the government, rather than society writ large.
1.8.12.3.2.1. Pro: It has been observed that bureaucracies rationally engage in [budget maximizing behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget-maximizing_model) \(regardless of results\).
1.8.12.3.2.2. Pro: A problem noted by many politicians \(including Bernie Sanders\) with government action is "[Regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)" wherein regulators give favors to the companies they should be regulating in return for future jobs/favors.
1.8.12.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.1.6.4.
1.8.12.4. Con: A large part of what allows a society to be prosperous and stable is reliance on a well-defined legal system that does not frequently change with the whims of elected officials/electorate because this encourages long-term planning.
1.8.12.4.1. Con: Following the logic of the parent, we should see much more resistance towards and complaints by businesses about rule changes such as tax reforms - yet we don't.
1.8.13. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.1.6.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.1.
1.10. Pro: Surveys indicate that the public would support this policy.
1.10.1. Con: Public support does not equate to morality. Pure democratic majority is just mob rule. Where the larger group can take from the smaller, even if it's only slightly bigger, and all in the name of democracy.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Just because people want something does not make it moral or a required government action. According to the General Social Survey \(GSS\), in 2016, 73% of Americans [opposed](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/trends/Civil%20Liberties?measure=affrmact&response=Oppose&breakdown=Total) or strongly opposed \(switch chart view to "strong oppose"\) affirmative action. Additionally, [58% of people](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/trends/Civil%20Liberties?measure=cappun&response=Favor&breakdown=Total) favor the death penalty.
1.10.1.2. Pro: You could expect the general public \(55% of the population, for the sake of argument\) to vote for anything that would benefit them at the expense of the remaining 45%. If 55% of people voted to impose some form of unfair predatory tax policy on the remaining 45%, this would not automatically render it morally acceptable.
1.10.2. Pro: Three out of four Americans believe that CEOs are paid too much in comparison to workers. About two thirds believe that this is a problem and that CEO's pay should be capped based on the pay of other workers \([Rock Center, p. 6-9](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/cgri-survey-2016-americans-ceo-pay.pdf)\).
1.10.2.1. Pro: Americans dramatically underestimate how much CEOs earn compared to workers. In surveys they indicate that a ratio of 7:1 would be ideal; they estimate that the real ratio is 30:1. In fact, it stands at 354:1 \([Kiatpongsan et al., p. 587](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/kiatpongsan%20norton%202014_f02b004a-c2de-4358-9811-ea273d372af7.pdf)\).
1.10.2.2. Pro: Public support would likely be even higher if Americans were aware of how much CEOs actually earn.
1.10.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.2.1.
1.10.2.2.2. Pro: Americans estimate in surveys that only half of the CEOs of the country's 500 largest companies earn more than $1 Million. In fact, with few voluntary exceptions, [all](http://graphics.wsj.com/ceo-salary-vs-company-performance/) of the CEOs of S&P 500 companies do; half of them earn more than $10.4 Million \([Rock Center, p. 6](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/cgri-survey-2016-americans-ceo-pay.pdf); [Meridian, p. 7](https://www.meridiancp.com/wp-content/uploads/Equilar-CEO-Pay-Trends-Report.pdf)\).
1.10.3. Con: Even if the public wants to see regulation of CEO payments, it is not clear in what way. Only a quarter of Americans would like to see a relative wage cap; a slightly larger share supports higher taxes on CEO compensation \([Rock Center, p. 10](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/cgri-survey-2016-americans-ceo-pay.pdf)\).
1.10.3.1. Pro: Other measures that would tackle inequality elicit far more public support. [Three our of four](http://www.people-press.org/2015/12/22/as-election-year-nears-public-sees-mixed-economic-picture/majority-supports-increase-in-federal-minimum-wage/) Americans support a higher federal minimum wage; a [small majority](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/04/5-facts-about-the-minimum-wage/) even wants to see it doubled to $15.
1.10.4. Pro: The American public perceives inequality as a problem and wants its society to be more equal.
1.10.4.1. Con: When asked about the [most pressing problem](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx) facing America today, only one in five citizens names an economic issue and only 2% name the gap between rich and poor. Issues such as immigration and healthcare rank much higher.
1.10.4.2. Pro: Two thirds of Americans [believe that](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/03/business/income-inequality-workers-rights-international-trade-poll.html) the distribution of wealth should be more equal, that the gap between the rich and poor is growing, and that this problem should be addressed now.
1.10.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.10.4.1.
1.10.4.3. Con: Surveys show that Americans [are split](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/02/why-people-are-rich-and-poor-republicans-and-democrats-have-very-different-views/) when it comes to the reasons for why some people are rich: about half believe that this is the result of hard work; the other half that this is the outcome of advantages. Thus, there is not necessarily support for government action to tackle inequality.
1.10.4.3.1. Pro: Furthermore, Republican voters [tend to consider](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/02/why-people-are-rich-and-poor-republicans-and-democrats-have-very-different-views/) riches as a result of hard work and poverty as a result of a lack of effort. This gives a Republican-backed government little incentive to make inequality a political priority.
1.10.4.3.2. Pro: [Almost two thirds](http://www.gallup.com/poll/188780/americans-satisfaction-ability-ahead-edges.aspx) of Americans are satisfied with the opportunities to get ahead through hard work. This equally indicates that there is no overwhelming public interest in government action to tackle inequality.
1.10.4.3.2.1. Con: It is questionable whether these attitudes should be taken at face value as they are most likely based on misconceptions. Americans vastly overestimate the chances for upwards mobility in their society and underestimate the chances for downwards mobility \([Davidai/Gilovich, p. 63](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691614562005)\).
1.10.4.4. Pro: This support for tackling inequality would probably be even stronger if Americans had a realistic picture of inequality in their country. They tend to [underestimate drastically](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/americans-want-to-live-in-a-much-more-equal-country-they-just-dont-realize-it/260639/) the share of wealth that is concentrated at the top.
1.10.4.5. Con: Research by various scholars points at the supposed paradox of people identifying inequality and perceiving it as a problem, yet not supporting political measures that would potentially tackle this issue \([Weakliem/Biggert, p. 66](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15691330-12341253#); [Ashok et al., p. 1](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21529.pdf); [Kuziemko et al., p. 1505](http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20130360)\).
1.10.5. Pro: About half of all Americans support government action to regulate the payment of CEOs, much more than speak out against it \([Rock Center, p. 9](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/cgri-survey-2016-americans-ceo-pay.pdf)\).
1.10.5.1. Con: At the same time, a slight majority of Republican supporters opposes government regulation of CEO payments. The current government might therefore have little incentive to follow up on public opinion at large \([Rock Center, p. 9](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/cgri-survey-2016-americans-ceo-pay.pdf)\).
1.10.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.2.2.
1.10.6. Con: [About half](http://www.gallup.com/poll/195893/partisan-divide-government-regulations-remains-wide.aspx) of all Americans believe that there is already too much government regulation of business; only one in five would like to see more regulation.
1.10.6.1. Con: These attitudes mostly point towards the heavy burden imposed by a growing tax code and other complicated rules. A salary cap, in contrast to that, would be straightforward and not impose much of an administrative burden.
1.10.7. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.
1.10.8. Con: If the introduction of a salary cap was of high importance to the electorate, it would feature more prominently in the public discourse and election campaigns of politicians.
1.10.8.1. Con: It is not only the public that determines which issues feature prominently in the public discourse and election campaigns. Thus, even topics that the public cares about might not be part of what is being talked about.
1.10.8.1.1. Pro: Politicians have an active interest to keep the issue of salary caps off the political agenda and out of the discourse.
1.10.8.1.1.1. Pro: Washington, D.C. has a [revolving door](https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/) between politics and big business. As a result, politicians have an interest in not regulating executive wages as they might profit from this once they leave government.
1.10.8.1.1.2. Pro: The industries with extremely well-paid executives are [among those](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/sectors.php?Cycle=2016&Bkdn=Source&Sortby=Rank) that contribute the most money to politicians, for example finance, insurances and real estate. Politicians, thus, have an active interest in not imposing regulation that would hurt those who provide their campaign funding.
1.10.8.1.1.3. Con: To the contrary, politicians might also have an interest in calling for executive salary caps as this is an easy way of garnering support. Thus, corresponding statements by politicians like [Barack Obama](https://www.forbes.com/2009/02/18/executive-compensation-cap-opinions-contributors_0219_executive_pay.html#) and [Jeremy Corbyn](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/01/jeremy-corbyns-maximum-wage-law-populism-he-promised-all-along) have been branded as populist.
1.10.8.1.2. Pro: The media fulfills a [gate-keeping function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeping_\(communication\)) and decides what becomes part of the public discourse, which is not necessarily what the public cares about.
1.10.8.2. Con: If the people were [aware of the magnitude](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/chris-rock-inequality-rich-people_n_6248392.html) of the inequality they would want the government to act to reduce it.
1.10.8.2.1. Pro: A recent survey found that when american employees were asked to guess the amount that their CEO was payed they estimated a [tenth](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/guess-how-much-ceo-makes) of their actual income.
1.10.8.2.2. Pro: When given a \(blind\) choice between a distribution of wealth as found in the USA and a far more equal distribution found in Sweden, 98% Americans [surveyed](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20ariely.pdf) preferred the Swedish distribution.
1.10.8.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.1.2.
1.10.8.2.4. Con: -> See 1.10.4.5.
1.11. Con: Salary caps are next to impossible to enforce.
1.11.1. Pro: Corporations could change their structure to avoid this regulation. Put all the higher-paid employees in one company, the lower-paid employees in another company and have these sister companies trade services.
1.11.1.1. Pro: In addition to the creation of multiple business entities, companies could furthermore offshore part of their staff, thereby employing some workers in entities not subject to national wage caps.
1.11.1.2. Con: If corporations were to do this, then the government based on publicly available information or through tax returns, would be able to 'ignore' the corporate structures in a similar manner to what currently occurs when companies engage in illegal tax evasion.
1.11.1.2.1. Con: This would be costly to enforce and require a greater number of fraud investigators to be employed by government agencies.
1.11.1.2.1.1. Pro: It is even questionable whether such conduct would constitute fraud in the first place.
1.11.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The government would have the power to legislate to make it constitute fraudulent conduct.
1.11.1.2.2. Con: It is likely that even if the government had the power to prosecute companies for evading the cap, companies would slip through the cracks.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.
1.11.3. Con: Even if the salary cap was circumvented, it would still express a societal and political condemnation of excessive pay. If companies circumvent the cap, it would reflect badly on them and lead to public shaming.
1.11.3.1. Con: Unless the company is well known by the public, public shaming is not so likely.
1.11.3.1.1. Con: For better, or worse, [many](http://time.com/4955327/john-oliver-corporate-consolidation-last-week-tonight/) major companies are currently one of under a dozen in their field, so this is actually quite likely.
1.11.4. Con: Just because a potential loophole exists does not mean that the central idea is bad. Legislation can be created to effectively work around most loopholes if political will exists.
1.11.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.4.1.1.
1.11.5. Con: Salary caps would be very easy to enforce. The IRS collects wage and workplace data on every American employee. It would be a trivial database query to compare a company's highest paid employee to its lowest. Any enabling legislation for said cap could direct the IRS to exact a penalty on corporate tax returns for non-compliance.
1.11.6. Con: Circumvention of a strong barrier is still going to result in far less money removed from the economy by bad-faith participants than what they can remove in the case of no or minimal restriction.
1.11.7. Con: Salary caps would be relatively easy to enforce by modifying current IRC provisions. The main thing to consider is what constitutes "compensation" for this limit those at the top often get significant perks which may or may not be taxable \(or currently taxable\).
1.12. Pro: US businesses would gain more legitimacy.
1.12.1. Pro: US companies, especially when this policy results in raising the salaries of foreign workers to increase the high-end of the cap, would stop being seen as exploiting the labor of poor foreigners.
1.12.1.1. Con: It is unclear why this would result in raising the salaries of foreign workers to increase the high end of the cap.
1.12.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.
1.12.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.20.
1.12.1.2. Pro: [Almost 40%](http://mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Education/Education-to-Employment-exec-summary_FINAL.pdf) of employers report that U.S. labour alone cannot supply the level of skilled employees needed. Increasing wages for foreign employees, particularly those completing highly skilled roles, would significantly undermine a perception of US exploitation.
1.12.2. Con: There's no proven link between legitimacy and capping executives pay at 35 times employees. Salaries in the US are [at the top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage) or near the top when compared to global standards, which would suggest we already have legitimacy.
1.12.3. Con: Most customers and business partners of American companies either do not know or do not care about their pay structures.
1.12.3.1. Con: 9 out of 10 people would boycott an irresponsible company and 1 in 2 people has refused to give a company their custom in response to learning about '[bad corporate behaviour](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/05/21/consumers-boycott-companies-bad-behavior-gap-protests/2343619/)'. This illustrates how customers can demonstrate their dissatisfaction with a company's actions.
1.12.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.8.2.1.
1.12.3.3. Con: Employees of closely related companies will care about pay structures in American firms, as it will impact directly on their pay in a corporation which has offices in multiple countries.
1.12.3.4. Con: Suppliers of goods to American companies will care about pay structures as they may impact on the ability of those companies to gain a profit.
1.12.4. Con: Through the introduction of salary caps, American companies will become a symbol for a practice that many international business people will consider harmful and want to avoid: the limitation of executives' payments
1.12.5. Con: While some countries are considering this proposal \(or have implemented it\) the overwhelming majority do not have CEO salary caps. Therefore, it is unclear why they would even care about the U.S. adopting a policy they do not favor for themselves.
1.12.5.1. Pro: In 2013 Switzerland [considered, and rejected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/24/switzerland-votes-against-cap-executive-pay), a very similar proposal to limit the highest paid workers to12 times the pay of the lowest earners.
1.12.5.1.1. Pro: Despite public outrage at the level of pay received by executives, which was as strong as the outrage felt in America, the referendum was [defeated](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/swiss-voters-reject-112-proposal-to-cap-top-executives-pay-in-latest-referendum-8960669.html) with on a margin of nearly two "no" votes to every "yes" vote.
1.12.5.1.2. Con: Switzerland is a small state, with its major cities located right on the boarder. The risk of companies outsourcing was far greater there, and this was a major [reason](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-vote-pay/swiss-voters-reject-proposal-to-limit-executives-pay-idUSBRE9AN0BW20131124) for the no vote.
1.12.5.2. Con: If countries are considering or have implemented salary caps, that means enough people in those countries believe this is a good thing. In this case, the US would indeed gain in reputation in these countries. Assuming that salary caps would not result in a loss of reputation elsewhere, this is a net gain.
1.12.5.3. Con: Global [research](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/americans-ceo-pay-2016-public-perception-survey-ceo-compensation) on public opinion on CEO salaries has found the [vast majority](https://hbr.org/2014/09/ceos-get-paid-too-much-according-to-pretty-much-everyone-in-the-world) of people think that CEOs are overpaid, and their ideal CEO: unskilled worker ratio was less than 5:1, far lower than the proposed 35:1 cap.
1.12.5.3.1. Pro: This level of criticism of current CEO salaries creates a clear reason why many people, in the USA, and across the world, would be interested in the result of a salary cap in US companies.
1.12.6. Pro: The US has historically criticized high executive pay and promised to constrain corporate greed, with President Trump [calling](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-idUSKCN0RD0PA20150913) high executive compensation a "joke" and a "disgrace." Following through on this promise would improve the credibility of US actors.
1.12.6.1. Pro: During his term, President Obama set a 500,000 dollar [pay cap](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29003620/ns/business-us_business/t/obama-imposes-limits-executive-pay/) for senior executives whose institutions were receiving large bailout sums.
1.12.6.2. Con: Despite his criticism of high executive pay, in 2007, President Bush encouraged a move towards performance based pay but [said](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16903282/ns/business-us_business/t/bush-takes-aim-executive-salaries/) "Government should not decide the compensation for America's corporate executives". This policy would entail further government intervention in corporate pay.
1.12.6.3. Pro: This political view matches public opinion.
1.12.6.3.1. Pro: The disparity between earnings of lower wage workers, and those in charge of large corporations currently creates the impression that businesses are[greedy and immoral.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rexnord-jobs-mexico_us_58078237e4b0dd54ce368da5) Reducing the gap between earnings by those who run companies and their employees would reduce this.
1.12.6.3.1.1. Con: This resentment is driven by the large profits made by companies, not the amount paid to some employees. So long as shareholders are allowed to protect their profit, the anger will remain.
1.12.6.3.1.1.1. Con: The movement describes itself as protesting the["Tyranny of the 1%".](https://www.brookings.edu/research/not-so-demanding-why-occupy-wall-street-need-not-make-demands-yet/) Reducing the huge wealth disparity between CEOs and ordinary workers will reduce the amount of wealth held by very few people in the US. Thus it will reduce anger and resentment currently aimed at businesses.
1.12.6.3.2. Pro: A 2016 [survey](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/americans-ceo-pay-2016-public-perception-survey-ceo-compensation) of over 1,200 Americans found that they overwhelmingly believed that CEOs were overpaid. Another [poll](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/13/executive-pay-poll_n_4780170.html) found that the same was believed by to two thirds of Americans.
1.12.6.3.3. Pro: The resentment created has led to violence in some protests [around the globe](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/across-the-world-the-indignant-rise-up-against-corporate-greed-and-cuts-2371357.html). It seems likely that protests seen in the US such as the Occupy Wall street protest that was [fueled](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-morningside-post/the-meaning-of-occupy-wall-street_b_1004481.html) by a sense that the rich claim the majority of profit created by businesses, tap into a significant current of public opinion.
1.12.6.4. Pro: Both Democratic contenders for the 2016 Presidential election, [Hillary Clinton](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-inequality-idUSKBN0N421620150413) and [Bernie Sanders](http://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-latest-fight-about-ceo-pay-and-wall-street-reform-572333), are outspoken against high CEO pay, and in the case of Sanders, even "largely built his presidential campaign around that fight."
1.12.6.5. Pro: President Trump criticised pharmaceutical companies for extortionate profit making, however failed to match his rhetoric with any [material policy change](https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-06-20/trump-drug-price-promise-seems-likely-to-be-broken). This policy would counteract this loss of prestige.
1.13. Pro: More equitable pay would improve company culture and increase employee morale.
1.13.1. Con: Companies only have incentives to raise the floor or lower the ceiling, not to raise everyone up. This means median income is unlikely to change, making middle income people likely to feel less valued.
1.13.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.1.
1.13.1.2. Con: At many companies, even the median wage is so much lower than the highest wage that raising the floor will certainly profit a great number of workers. The other way around, reducing the highest wage to fit the salary cap would be hard to sell to the recipient of this salary.
1.13.1.2.1. Pro: In order to fit the proposed salary cap, [Chipotle and Walmart](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/ceo-pay-ratio/) would either have to cut the pay of its CEOs by at least 97% or increase the pay of half of its workforce by at least a factor of 40 to an annual salary of $825.000 or more.
1.13.1.2.2. Pro: A relative payment cap is opposed by America's most powerful business leaders. Among the CEOs of surveyed S&P 500 companies, 97% spoke out against government regulation of CEO payments \([Rock Center, p. 12](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/cgri-survey-2016-ceo-compensation_0.pdf)\).
1.13.1.3. Con: Reducing the ceiling would make middle income people feel more valued as, though their absolute income would increase, the amount they would be earning relative to their bosses would be higher than before.
1.13.1.4. Con: Middle income employees are not being systemically undervalued and denied living wages the way that low income employees are.
1.13.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.13.3. Con: This implies that this would be beneficial to the companies ability to compete. If that's true a less greedy person would have already tried this model and used it to beat their competition. The government wouldn't need to force it.
1.13.3.1. Con: A pleasant company culture and high morale among employees are valuable for their own sake, independent of whether they improve a company's ability to compete.
1.13.4. Con: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.1.6.4.2.
1.13.5. Con: A company forced to increase the wages of staff may have to compensate by saving on [other benefits](https://hbr.org/2017/02/why-we-need-to-stop-obsessing-over-ceo-pay-ratios) such as such as on-the-job training, flexible working conditions, and opportunities for advancement. Losing such benefits may well cause more resentment than a pay disparity does now.
1.13.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.2.1.1.6.1.3.6.1.
1.13.7. Pro: This policy would make a public statement that the pay of all employees in a company is linked. Regardless of the opinion of workers right now, this would create a feeling of unity.
1.13.8. Pro: There is a disconnect between top and bottom that negates motivation to succeed. The opportunity to legitimately know, not guess, the structure of salary tiers, and being able to feel that the corporate structure is transparent, would show respect to entry-level workers.
1.13.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.13.9. Con: This may be true, but it should not be up to the government to enforce.
1.13.9.1. Pro: The government has no business interfering with the internal affairs of companies as long as they do not violate any rules or standards and do not have negative effects beyond the company.
1.13.9.1.1. Con: The salaries set by companies have ramifications beyond the company itself as large disparities in employee pay contributes to societal income inequality.
1.13.9.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.14.1.
1.13.9.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.6.
1.13.9.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.5.
1.13.10. Pro: The CEO and shareholders shouldn't be the sole beneficiaries of business success, a business should reward staff when times are good. If a CEO can only raise their own salary when the staff have also been compensated appropriately, then their financial incentives align with both those of the workers and the shareholders.
1.13.10.1. Pro: [Data suggests](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/02/why-the-gap-between-worker-pay-and-productivity-is-so-problematic/385931/) that many businesses are not rewarding staff when times are good, or indeed at all. "Though productivity grew by about 74 percent between 1973 and 2013, compensation for workers grew at a much slower rate of only 9 percent during the same time period".
1.13.10.2. Con: The rate of total worker compensation growth [has been outstripping](http://www.politifact.com/corporatewages/) the rate of total corporate profit growth for decades, even taking into account population growth. CEOs have, by no means, been the only beneficiaries of business success.
1.13.10.3. Con: The success of a company does not necessarily raise the value of an individual worker's labor. The thing that differentiates successful and unsuccessful business is strategy, organization, and higher-level efficiency, so the leaders and managers who make those decisions deserve to be compensated more.
1.14. Pro: The state ought take steps to protect workers from exploitation, and if exploitation is defined as the unfair treatment of someone in order to benefit from that person's work, the inequality between the payment of executives and workers suggests exploitative wage policies.
1.14.1. Pro: When business makes bad decisions, the workers are let go and not the executive. They can't be trusted to make fair decisions as capitalists see workers as an expense, which they will cut first, in order to make a profit.
1.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.
1.14.3. Con: A salary cap might be able to protect workers from unfair payment in relative term but cannot protect them from exploitative conditions in absolute terms and poverty.
1.14.4. Con: The state should not intervene on behalf of a worker who voluntarily accepted a job and the associated wage, because they are not being exploited.
1.14.4.1. Pro: Restricting employers freedom to offer whatever terms of employment they like may well reduce the amount of people that they can afford to employ. This means that the employee is left with less employment options to choose from.
1.14.4.1.1. Pro: Linking the wages of higher paid employees to the lowest creates an incentive to increase the wages of the lowest paid employees. It is likely that the firms will attempt to offset these wage increases with lay-offs.
1.14.4.1.1.1. Con: Organisations are already working to outsource, offshore or automate low skill jobs.
1.14.4.1.1.2. Pro: Because the maximum pay is such a large multiple of the lowest, every incremental increase of the lowest wage represents a large benefit to the top earners who wish to earn more.
1.14.4.1.1.3. Pro: While this is of benefit to those already employed in the industry, it represents a serious barrier for any person wishing to secure a job.
1.14.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: As wages increase, the firm will be able to higher less staff. It is unjustifiable to increase the wages of the few who remain employed, and the expense of leaving many more unemployed.
1.14.4.1.1.4. Con: If increasing the wages at the bottom meant that the firm could not employ as many than this would not be in its interest. Thus it would decrease the maximum pay rather than decrease pay for those at the bottom.
1.14.4.1.1.4.1. Pro: The Board of directors answer to shareholders, not the top employees of a company. Therefore they will not make decisions which damage the company for the benefit of those paid most.
1.14.4.1.1.4.2. Con: The need to attract the best employees at top levels means that firms cannot decrease CEO's pay dramatically. This means that they are forced to increase pay across the board, and thus can afford to employ less.
1.14.4.1.1.5. Pro: The increasing cost of labour makes an investment in ["automation rather than labor"](https://hbr.org/2017/02/why-we-need-to-stop-obsessing-over-ceo-pay-ratios) more likely. As wages rise, more expensive automation become closer to cost neutral with employment.
1.14.4.1.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.3.2.
1.14.4.1.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.3.3.
1.14.4.1.1.6. Pro: CEOs presumably want to keep their current salaries. This policy pushes them to press for increases in the salaries of entry-level employees. The problem is that companies are likely to compensate with lay-offs.
1.14.4.2. Con: -> See 1.8.7.4.
1.14.4.3. Con: The state intervenes all the time in employment situations.
1.14.4.3.1. Pro: There are laws relating to anti-discrimination, working conditions such as occupational health and safety and unfair dismissal.
1.14.4.3.2. Pro: The state will intervene in pay disputes including situations where an employee is being underpaid by a firm or paid below the minimum wage.
1.14.4.3.2.1. Pro: An investigation into the retail group 7-Eleven [revealed](http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/7eleven-compensation-wage-bill-may-top-100-million-20160408-go1eo7.html) that in Australia workers were underpaid up to $100 million AUD.
1.14.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: While the investigation into underpayment was [company funded](http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/7eleven-allan-fels-to-lead-wage-inquiry-20150903-gjehxu.html), if the company had refused to engage in the investigation the regulator the Australia Competition and Consumer Commission \(ACCC\) would have investigated the organisation themselves.
1.14.4.3.3. Con: It is paternalistic for the state to intervene in employment situations because those who enter into agreements are rational, capable individuals who have made a choice to be employed at a certain rate and under specific conditions.
1.14.4.3.3.1. Con: In most low paid jobs, the employer has considerably higher bargaining power and individuals are unable to negotiate work conditions. Therefore there is some level of doubt relating to their level of choice.
1.14.5. Con: A trade union or other lobbying body is the appropriate body to seek better work conditions for employees by negotiating directly with businesses rather than government intervention.
1.14.5.1. Con: Unions are open to be political tools, which serves individual's agendas, instead of being a guaranteed right for workers.
1.14.5.2. Con: Trade unions can vary in strength and when they are weak there is little reason for businesses to engage with their demands and it may be easy to overturn past agreements easily. Government regulations do not suffer from this weakness.
1.14.5.3. Con: In 2013, [only 11.3%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States) of US workers were unionised, down from 20.1% in 1983. Given that there is nothing to suggest that this trend will reverse itself, most workers do not have a union to  negotiate for them, and in that context government regulations are their only possible protection.
1.14.5.4. Pro: Regulations will often be watered down significantly and/or overturned entirely in the future due to the lobbying power of big business. For this reason workers cannot rely on them.
1.14.5.5. Pro: Regulation is a blunt instrument. Every sector of the economy, and in turn every business within those sectors, has its own unique needs and concerns. Blanket regulations will never be able to cater for this, but direct negotiations between unions and businesses can.
1.14.5.6. Con: There is a significant proportion of the workforce who are casually employed. Those employees do not have the same rights as full time employees \(for example, no sick leave\). As such, they are unlikely able to lobby for better work conditions and pay equity and in turn unlikely to be union members.
1.14.6. Con: The existence of a disparity of wages between owners/CEOs and the lowest paid employee is not sufficient to indicate exploitation.
1.14.6.1. Pro: Only [0.1%](http://www.epi.org/publication/top-ceos-make-300-times-more-than-workers-pay-growth-surpasses-market-gains-and-the-rest-of-the-0-1-percent/) of the population are employed as high paid CEOs. There simply are not enough of them to significantly affect the prices of goods bought by everyone else. This means that the amount that they are paid has no effect on the benefit that other workers derive form their pay. Altering their pay does not change whether the payment given to other employees can be described as unfair treatment.
1.14.6.1.1. Con: The payment received by lower paid employees is not exploitative just because it is low. They are exploited because an arbitrary and vast amount of the wealth created by their labour is given to a CEO rather than given back to them. Even if in absolute terms not all workers are paid an insignificant amount, the relatively immense payment given to CEOs is exploitative.
1.14.6.2. Pro: A situation is imaginable in which a company has enormous differences in pay yet even the worst-paid employee makes enough money to be well-off. Thus, income inequality can but does not always coincide with exploitation.
1.15. Con: This policy will force companies to employ less staff directly.
1.15.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.7.1.1.
1.15.2. Pro: -> See 1.14.4.1.1.
1.15.3. Con: This would lead to small businesses and service industry workers having more bargaining power as they would be organized in companies of their own.
1.15.4. Con: This would increase the exchange of funds between entities which would lead to an increase in GDP, causing the economy to grow.
1.15.4.1. Pro: GDP is "the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period". If companies paid for these services indirectly to service companies they would be included as a finished good and service while they are currently included as a cost \(which does not contribute to GDP\).
1.15.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.16.3.1.
1.15.6. Con: It is just as possible that, rather than cutting employees, companies would elect to lower executive pay.
1.15.7. Con: Nevertheless, this regulation would have its effect as outsourcing will create more demand for companies that employ low-skilled workers, thus increasing their wages.
1.15.7.1. Con: No new demand would be created through outsourcing as the amount of available work would remain the same.
1.15.7.2. Pro: If a lot of work is outsourced to other companies \(e.g. janitorial, secretarial\), this would give the third party companies that provide those services the opportunity to set the prices for those services themselves which can in turn trickle down to higher salaries for the people that do these jobs. Since the outsourcing company is now dependent on this third party company, it is easier to negotiate higher salaries for the jobs that have been outsourced.
1.15.7.2.1. Con: The wages are set by the market in this scenario. Due to the nature of low-skill jobs, a plethora of these kinds of outsourcing companies will arise, competing to the bottom of the barrel.
1.15.7.2.2. Con: Generally, the only way low-skill workers move up is through promotion within a company. These low-skill outsourcing companies will have a very flat hierarchical structure with extremely limited advancement opportunities. Wages would most certainly stagnate.
1.16. Pro: -> See 1.8.12.3.1.1.1.1.
