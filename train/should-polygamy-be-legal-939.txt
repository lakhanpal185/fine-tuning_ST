Discussion Title: Should Polygamy Be Legal?

1. Polygamy should be legal
1.1. Pro: Monogamy and Marriage are both social constructs. Men are biologically designed to mate with many females. It's time for society to stop suppressing male sexuality by legalizing polygamous marriages.
1.1.1. Pro: Females are designed to mate with multiple males to get the best genetic material but at the same time maintain a steady relationship with a male so that he can function as a parent for her offspring [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1559901/) [citeseerx.ist.psu.edu](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.495.1474&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
1.2. Con: Polygamy violates human rights.
1.2.1. Con: The fact that in Arabic countries women’s rights are often violated and polygamy is allowed doesn’t mean that polygamy is the reason for women’s rights violation.
1.2.2. Pro: Polygyny subjugates women.
1.2.2.1. Pro: A [study](http://isp.sagepub.com/content/52/1/5.abstract) of Bedouin-Arab women found that "Women in polygamous marriages showed significantly higher psychological distress, and higher levels of somatisation, phobia and other psychological problems. They also had significantly more problems in family functioning, marital relationships and life satisfaction".
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Bedouin-Arab women face a different lifestyle than women in the Western world. Given the differences in family functioning, marital relationships and sources of life satisfaction we cannot deduce that the same holds true for people in the Western world. It might even be reversed.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Studies in other societies have [confirmed](http://jfi.sagepub.com/content/36/8/1087.abstract) negative effects on women.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Already a breakdown in different age groups [changes](http://isp.sagepub.com/content/58/1/79.abstract) the result.
1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: Federal and provincial governments in [Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-polygamy-legislation-1.856477) "contended that allowing men to marry more than one woman leads to physical and sexual abuse, child brides and the subjugation of women."
1.2.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Allegations of subjugated women, child brides and sexual abuses do refer to a cultural or religious component among people practicing it. This does not apply to an enlightened society in which all partners freely choose to do so just as they could live together without formalization.
1.2.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Most people would not think of Canada's society being any less enlightened than other first world societies and still these problems seem to occur.
1.2.2.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Also in [Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-polygamy-legislation-1.856477) these fears are found in other religions or cultures. It is percieved as something "that comes to Canada" by Muslims or fundamental Christians within society.
1.2.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Federal and provincial governments in Canada are likely to have little experience with polygamy. This makes their statement uninformed.
1.2.2.1.1.3.3. Con: This is a mis-attributed cause/effect. Polygamy does not inherently cause child marriage, but cultures that support and practice systems like polygamy that are far outside of Western norms are more likely to also have the issues listed.
1.2.2.2. Con: Women living in polygyny are advocating it.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Women living in polygny are less [stressed](http://connectusfund.org/list-of-12-big-pros-and-cons-of-polygamy) since they are freed from housework.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: In an equal marriage a woman is freed from housework to some part, because the man has to help as well.
1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Regardless of who is responsible for what portion of the housework, more hands will lead to a reduced workload overall.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: Most women living in polygyny grew up in polygamous families. Therefore it is completely normal and natural for them.
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: More women in polygamous marriages agreed with the practice of polygamy than their monogamous counterparts.
1.2.2.2.4. Pro: More women in [polygamous](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21088033) marriages agreed with the practice than their monogamous counterparts.
1.2.2.2.5. Pro: From a [Pareto optimum](http://bigthink.com/dangerous-ideas/22-polygamy-is-feminist) perspective it makes sense for women to advocate polygny.
1.2.2.2.6. Con: There are [accounts](http://www.cbn.com/entertainment/books/shattereddreams.aspx) of women who describe life as one of many wives as "agony and wrenching pain".
1.2.2.2.6.1. Con: There are accounts of women who describe life as a one-and-only wife similarly, but such accounts do not support abolishing the possibility of marriage between two consenting adults.
1.2.2.2.7. Con: Many people participate in activities even though they do not like them, advocate for them, or support them.
1.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.3.
1.2.2.4. Con: Polygyny is only one form of Polygamy. There is also the possibility of polyandry, which does not subjugate women at all.
1.2.2.4.1. Con: But polygny would be allowed once polygamy is legal.
1.2.2.4.2. Pro: A woman being married to several male husbands puts the woman in the leading role.
1.2.2.4.2.1. Con: Which in turn could lead male partners to submissive roles. Accepting polygamy means not cherry picking in its various forms.
1.2.2.5. Con: Individualist feminism [advocates](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/04/legalize_polygamy_marriage_equality_for_all.html) support the freedom for adults to voluntarily enter polygamous marriages.
1.2.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.5.
1.2.2.6. Pro: Dr. Rana [Raddawi](http://www.thenational.ae/uae/polygamy-can-negatively-affect-women-study-finds), associate professor in the department of English at the American University of Sharjah, surveyed 100 Arab women in polygamous marriages and found that many of them experience feelings of neglect and jealousy.
1.2.2.6.1. Con: Some research [suggests](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women-happy-85-aged-elderly-partner-die-husband-survey-a8110061.html) women are less happy than men in [monogamous](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2016/12/27/women-are-less-happy-than-men-in-marriage-so-why-does-the-media-insist-otherwise/) marriage, and Arab women in particular [may be](https://stepfeed.com/10-reasons-why-arab-girls-must-get-married-in-their-20s-8606) getting married for practical rather than 'happiness' reasons.  As long as it's a real 'choice', that's a woman's right and business.
1.2.2.6.2. Con: This is only a result of unqualified husbands. Modern emancipated women are smart enough to pick the right one who is responsible.
1.2.2.6.3. Con: Feelings of jealousy are a form of personal weakness and do not reflect on the system of polygamy.
1.2.2.6.4. Con: Neglect and jealousy are interpersonal problems that, in an egalitarian relationship, would be worked through collectively. In first-hand experience with many polyamorous persons, these emotions are dealt with as a group as long as the relationship itself is healthy.
1.2.2.7. Con: Women and men can always file for divorce.
1.2.2.7.1. Con: Divorce proceedings are notoriously complicated, expensive, time-consuming, emotionally draining and have vast social, legal and financial consequences for the individuals involved.
1.2.2.7.2. Pro: The power relations in polygamous marriages should be even more favorable to female sponsored divorce as it is more likely that women can keep their children while at the same time the man becomes less dependent on one woman emotionally.
1.2.2.7.2.1. Con: But then again, the man fearing other wives might follow suit would invest more energy to force the one from abstaining divorce.
1.2.2.8. Pro: Polygamous relationships tend to lead to [objectification of women's bodies](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-objectification/) rather than emotional intimacy.
1.2.3. Pro: Many international human-rights organisations as well as women's rights groups in many countries have called for the abolition of polygamy.
1.2.3.1. Con: They all refer solely to polygyny, but not to polyandry.
1.2.3.2. Con: Countries with current institutionalized [polygamy](https://www.indy100.com/article/polygamy-around-the-world-map-reddit-7621171)are also countries that currently have high [gender inequality](https://www.indy100.com/article/polygamy-around-the-world-map-reddit-7621171).  In such countries a woman's rights to opt out \(or leave if unhappy\) is problematic and abuse can occur.  That is not an inherent property of polygamy and has to be separated from its implementation.
1.2.3.3. Con: They imply that women are sole victims and have no power to forge their own destiny. This is not the case in the Western world, where women are an integral part of running their countries.
1.2.3.4. Pro: The practice of polygamy has been ruled as violating the ICCPR \(International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\) and the United Nations has recommended abolishing the practice. \([justice.gc.ca](http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/poly/chap3.html); [www2.ohchr.org](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/IHRLS_Chad_95.pdf); [www1.umn.edu](http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/gencomm/hrcom28.htm)\)
1.2.3.4.1. Con: The first [article](http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/poly/chap3.html) contains specious reasoning such as "Polygamous marriage contravenes a woman's right to equality with men".  [Polygamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy) only means "state of marriage to many spouses" and has no set gender roles or ranking.  The rest of the article is similarly laced with bias and focused on a single form of polygamy in a single culture group.
1.2.3.4.2. Con: The [second article](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/IHRLS_Chad_95.pdf) explicitly focuses on Chad, which has [systemic problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Chad) in the area of [women's rights](http://www.refugeelegalaidinformation.org/chad-fgm).  We cannot assert anything about polygamy as a concept based on this because we cannot separate out the higher order problems impacting women in that country.
1.2.3.4.3. Con: The [third article](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/gencomm/hrcom28.htm) makes a single statement on poly and bases it on "undermine the right of women to marry only when they have given free and full consent".  Proposed Western polygamy allows for and requires full consent, like all forms of marriage in the west, invalidating that premise.
1.2.3.4.4. Con: This is judged through a lense of cultural or religious prejudice, particularly to Islam and fundamental Christians.
1.2.3.4.4.1. Pro: The document by the Canadian Department of Justice refers to [problems of polygny](http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/poly/chap3.html) "as practised in many cultural contexts".
1.2.3.4.4.2. Pro: The two UN sources refer to [polygamy](http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/gencomm/hrcom28.htm) as problem resulting from deviations to "women's right to marry only when they have given free and full consent". In modern countries these rights are guaranteed and thus the grounds for UN criticism abolished.
1.2.3.4.4.3. Pro: The third sources cited above dealing with [Chad](http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/IHRLS_Chad_95.pdf), similar to the two UN sources, locates the problem with polygamy in denying "girls the right of full consent to marry" and afilure to safeguard equal rights during marriage. Both sources do not have signifcance for the Western world where adequate protection measures are in place.
1.2.3.4.4.4. Con: These religious tendencies are existing in the West as well and, thus, we cannot put lipstick on the danger.
1.2.3.4.4.4.1. Pro: It is likely that especially those anchored in polygamy permitting traditions, such as Muslims, have a higher propensity to make use of favorable legislation.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2. Con: Countries \(more specific governments\) can easily set up institutions and policies that prevent negative effects of polygamy detected in more archaic societies and cultures.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.1. Pro: Jurisdiction and police are able to safeguard a wife's personal and physical integrity.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.1.1. Con: Many victims of physical and/or sexual abuse never talk to anyone about their problems.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.2. Pro: Family law allows for a regulated exit option in the form of divorce.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.3. Pro: There is a minimum marriage age that is strictly observed. This helps to prevent child abuses.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.4. Pro: Western culture has created independent women who are strong on their own and do not need the protection or support of their husband. This reduces the subjugation of women.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.5. Pro: Polygamous marriages will receive special scrutiny due to their unusual character and thus will be monitored stricter than regular marriages.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.5.1. Con: There is a high degree of anonymity in today's society which will cover this scrutiny.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.6. Pro: NGOs for human rights / womens' rights are powerful in established democracies and can be called upon in case of an emergency.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.7. Pro: There are regional offices that provide support for women suffering from domestic violence or psychological problems.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.8. Con: The protection of personal privacy protects the home. Anything that is happening at home in today's modern societies is more likely to be covered-up than in the past where everyone knew everyone in his village.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.9. Con: These institutions have already failed in regard to domestic violence. This makes them unlikely to work any better with a group that is exposed to a higher risk of domestic problems.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.10. Con: Institutions and policies do not change psychological dependencies between husband and wives.
1.2.3.4.4.4.2.10.1. Pro: Power in a relationship is as much physical as structural and verbal. But only for physical violence there is the police that can protect the victim.
1.2.4. Con: There is no human right violation if consent is present.
1.2.4.1. Con: There are many harms we recognize regardless of whether consent is present. For example, most people would say there is harm in someone selling himself into slavery, regardless of whether he consents.
1.2.4.2. Con: Whether consent exists in a polygamous relationship is not always clear. Although its participants might say they consent to it, the reality is that there are many power dynamics at play.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Children raised in fundamentalist Mormonism [must choose](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2007/11/02/november-2-2007-children-of-polygamists/4509/) between participating in polygamy or being kicked out of their communities and rejected by their families.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon has [criticized](http://feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/MacKinnon-Sexuality-Pornography-and-Method-Pleasure-under-Patriarchy.pdf) the idea of formal consent; instead, she says, we must look to the social conditions that compel consent to oppressive acts.
1.2.5. Con: This is only true in societies with forced or coercive marriages dominated by one gender and a "gotta catch em all" attitude.
1.3. Pro: Polyamorous people generally describe their state similarly to LGBTQ+: it is not a 'choice'.  They can suppress it, hide it, but monogamy never feels natural.
1.4. Pro: Possible negative effects of polygamy can easily be contained.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.4.4.4.2.
1.4.2. Con: Many who morally object to polygamy object due to their own definition of marriage not because of the negative effects of polygamy.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Marriage has never been a private matter only.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The church highly influences conceptions of marriage and even the procedure is made by them.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: As far back as he 16th century the church [emphasised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_the_Catholic_Church) their right to be the sole responsibile for marriage matters.
1.4.2.1.1.2. Con: No one needs a church to get married.
1.4.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Atheists get married in a civil cermeony.
1.4.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: A church marriage only is not state-approved.
1.4.2.1.1.2.3. Con: Just because legally the state is the authority to declare marriages the church is shaping its interpretative context and imagination we hold about marriage.
1.4.2.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Many brides still wear white at weddings without being wed in a church. This is linked to the tradition as shaped by the church.
1.4.2.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: The procedure with asking the partners directly if they want is equal to church practices.
1.4.2.1.1.2.3.3. Con: Looking at the huge number of divorces the church \(especially the Catholic church\) is not shaping very much our imagination we hold about marriage anymore.
1.4.2.1.1.2.3.3.1. Pro: According to the church a marriage may not be divorced by humans but nowadays everybody can easily get a divorce.
1.4.2.1.1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: The [divorce to marriage ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_demography) is 44% in the EU and 53% in the U.S.
1.4.2.1.1.2.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: The average [duration](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/02/daily-chart-10) of a marriage in 2014 was 13.6 years.
1.4.2.1.1.2.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.1.2.3.3.1.1.
1.4.2.1.1.2.3.3.3. Con: The realities might be different but the imagination stays the same. Most people believe they marry one person forever \(imagination\) but find contrary tendencies later and divorce \(reality\).
1.4.2.1.2. Con: There is an important difference between marriage as an institution and the form of romantic union itself. Because any form of romantic union could be institutionalized as marriage. Therefore marriage may have never been a private matter only, but the form of romantic union should be absolutely private.
1.4.2.2. Con: The right of adults to marry should not be precluded by a person's distaste for their marital structure. The same argument is used against same-sex marriage, and it is invariably irrelevant.
1.5. Pro: Monogamy works for very few, as evidenced by divorce rates.
1.6. Pro: From the moment a government accepts gay marriage, the definition of a couple and thus the constraints of monogamy becomes irrelevant.
1.6.1. Pro: Couple and monogamy was only relevant due to the legal definition given, of 2 different sexes forming the root of family. Since that has been redefined, that same should be extended to those in polygamous relationships.
1.7. Con: The practice of polygamy is fine, but under written law it could be very difficult to regulate. Polygamous marriages and divorces would be very difficult to regulate, and would cause un necessary stress to the judicial system.
1.8. Con: Polygamy can have negative consequences for society.
1.8.1. Con: Freedoms of individuals should only be limited when they infringe on the freedoms of others; negative consequences do meet that criteria.
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.8.3. Pro: A 2012 study from the University of British Columbia shows that, in polygamist cultures, "the intra-sexual competition that occurs causes greater levels of [crime](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120124093142.htm), violence, poverty and gender inequality than in societies that institutionalize and practice monogamous marriage".
1.8.3.1. Con: Linked article does not cite sample groups or how it evaluated data.  Certain cultural practices that oppress women are harmful, this does not translate to all cultures.
1.8.3.2. Con: The article basis part of its position on: "According to Henrich, monogamy's main cultural evolutionary advantage over polygyny is the more egalitarian distribution of women".  Women are not property and, in the West, are allowed to make their own choices and leave relationships that make them unhappy
1.8.3.3. Con: The study only looked at what happens if you surplant polygamous marriages with monogamous ones. It does not speak about the reverse effects which could be completely different.
1.8.3.3.1. Pro: Today's society has a high level of centralized force in an integral police force. This would prevent intra-sexual violence in the first place.
1.8.3.4. Pro: Crime rates tend to be [higher](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/04/one-man-many-wives-big-problems/304829/) in polygynous societies.
1.8.3.4.1. Con: These findings are situated in societies that lacked efficient crime prevention institutions, such as medieval Portugal or 19th century China.
1.8.3.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.4.4.4.2.
1.8.3.6. Con: Monogamous forms of living together did not evolve because of evolutionary problems but social habits.
1.8.3.6.1. Pro: Monogamy proved best in cementing power relations between two families in medieval Europe and bourgeois industrialization.
1.8.3.7. Con: This study only looked at examples of polygamy that allowed husbands to take multiple wives, but not the other way around. In first world countries, it is much more likely you would see egalitarian polygamy, where both genders would be allowed multiple partners. This changed fact would have an incredible difference on the observations made in said study.
1.8.4. Pro: For children, it is bad to grow up in a polygamous family.
1.8.4.1. Con: Children are harmed more in a bad monogamy than in a polygamy. In a society where almost everyone is polygamous, one's children are essentially everybody's children. Children can be taken care of by anyone who loves them.
1.8.4.2. Pro: As mothers tend to be younger in polygamous societies, children suffer from less experienced and mature mothers. A problem their monogamously raised counterparts rather avoid.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: The children will have several older / more mature stepmothers.
1.8.4.2.1.1. Con: The relationship to stepmothers, even though sometimes beneficial, is highly fragile and most of the times does more harm than good.
1.8.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: The reports of children who grow up in polygamous families report abuse by their stepmothers.
1.8.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Laura [Chapman](http://helpthechildbrides.com/stories/laurachap.htm) described her experience as child in a poloygamous marriage as: "It's like I was walking around unconcious".
1.8.4.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Kathy](http://www.todayschristianwoman.com/articles/2007/may/i-grew-up-in-polygamist-family.html) who grow up in a polygamous family thought it was full of "jealousy and pain."
1.8.4.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Brian J. [Mackert](http://www.childbrides.org/brian_mackert.html) describes it as family in which "abuse was easy to hide".
1.8.4.2.1.2. Pro: One of the aspects related to the raising of children that could be improved with legal polygamy, is the the amount of attention that the children could receive from the parents.
1.8.4.3. Pro: Children have to struggle with having multiple step mothers that are often in constant struggle with each other.
1.8.4.3.1. Pro: Laura [Chapman](http://helpthechildbrides.com/stories/laurachap.htm), who fled from a polygamous family, says that she has "seen women scratch, kick, pull hair over how they load the dishwasher".
1.8.4.3.1.1. Con: Laura Champman's accounts, while tragic, are not representative of just a polygamist situation, but also one of molestation and cult like behavior and isolation. The claims using her account as proof against polygamy is ignoring other potential causes of said behaviors.
1.8.4.3.2. Con: [Statistics indicate](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/strictly-casual/201412/are-people-in-open-relationships-happier) that people are actually happier on average in non-monogamous relationships, which in turn imply less or equal relationship fighting on average than monogamous individuals. While anecdotal evidence exists for fighting within a non-monogamous unit, the same anecdotal evidence exists for monogamous marriages.
1.8.4.3.3. Con: There are healthy relationships, and unhealthy ones where parents fight constantly. This is true regardless of the nature of the relationship, and is not correlated to polygamy.
1.8.4.4. Pro: If you are a single child resulting from a polygamous family you have a lot of work caring for the many elderly family members.
1.8.4.4.1. Con: These family members can better take care of themselves as they are more.
1.8.4.4.2. Con: Chances are rather low that a polygamous family will bring up only one child.
1.8.4.4.2.1. Pro: It is rather unusual to use birth control in a long relationship. And in a polygamous marriage the chances would be high, that more than just one wife would get pregnant.
1.8.4.5. Con: An extended harmonious family can be a source of mental and material support.
1.8.4.5.1. Pro: People are free to choose their partners. That makes them as likely to have a harmonious polygamous family as to have a harmonious monogamous family.
1.8.4.5.2. Pro: Many breadwinners can provide for education of the child which gives her/him an advantage over other kids.
1.8.4.5.3. Pro: Children receive better and more frequent advice by the elderly, which helps them develop themselves.
1.8.4.5.4. Con: Polygamous families are rarely harmonious. To the contrary, they tend to be chaotic and psychologically harmful to [women](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Graham50/publication/224943991_A_Comparison_of_Family_Functioning_Life_and_Marital_Satisfaction_and_Mental_Health_of_Women_in_Polygamous_and_Monogamous_Marriages/links/59d9555f458515a5bc262f5a/A-Comparison-of-Family-Functioning-Life-and-Marital-Satisfaction-and-Mental-Health-of-Women-in-Polygamous-and-Monogamous-Marriages.pdf) and [children](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/50698131/a_3A102092512301620161203-14639-149nade.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1515107360&Signature=4m1PwU16zSaHCFuPPESXy6EZF5Y%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_effect_of_polygamous_marital_structu.pdf) involved in them.
1.8.4.6. Pro: Parents direct their attention to finding other new mates rather than investing in their children.
1.8.4.6.1. Con: Poly families have more resources \(time\) to make sure children always have someone looking after them - they [can take turns](https://www.quora.com/Is-polyamory-and-having-children-more-challenging-than-under-monogamy) babysitting / educating while others have their date nights and adventures.
1.8.4.6.2. Pro: A father who already has multiple women will probably be less loyal to them than one who only has one wife.
1.8.4.6.2.1. Con: Polyamory in the West is based [heavily](http://www.polyamoryonline.org/articles/12pillars.html) on trust, open communication, safety, and consent.
1.8.4.6.2.2. Con: A partner having multiple partners is taken care of enough. There is probably less need to find even more partners. This is also a matter of free time, when having multiple partners free time is probably rare.
1.8.4.6.3. Pro: They might have so many children that they do not relate to the individiual child anymore. Winston [Blackmore](http://news.nationalpost.com/toronto/child-care-benefit-could-be-a-potential-43160-bonanza-for-b-c-polygamist-with-133-children) for example has 133 children.
1.8.4.6.3.1. Con: It is possible living in polygamous relationships and using birth control at the same time.
1.8.4.6.3.2. Con: This is an extreme example that would not be representative of a normal polygamous relationship
1.8.4.6.3.3. Con: It is not the state's business to regulate a parent's relationship to their children.
1.8.4.6.3.4. Con: The number of children a parent has does not directly affect how close their relationship will be to them.  Some parents with only a small number of children still do not have a close relationship with them, for a variety of reasons unrelated to the number of children there are.
1.8.4.6.4. Con: Children are expensive and thus fathers will have an eye on their expenditure as usual.
1.8.4.6.4.1. Con: But they will pay less for the individual child, thus reducing his financial commitment.
1.8.4.6.4.2. Pro: Mothers are also financially responsible for children. Therefore, all parents will have less time to pursue other mates.
1.8.4.6.5. Con: That could be a case for any other person as well, wether he or she is divorced, unhappily married or in a polygamous relationship.
1.8.4.7. Pro: Polygamous families tend to have [more](http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2012/05/5338/) children.
1.8.4.7.1. Con: Having many siblings is good for children.
1.8.4.7.1.1. Con: Having siblings does not have a significant [impact](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/only-children-lonely-and-selfish.html) on a child's wellbeing, character or academic performance.
1.8.4.7.1.1.1. Con: Studies show that the firstborn children are more [intelligent](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-34700739) and [successful](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/26/firstborn-children-excel-study-reveals) than their brothers and sisters. So having siblings is bad for every younger sibling.
1.8.4.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Other studies show that the [youngest](http://metro.co.uk/2015/01/27/the-youngest-sibling-is-the-funniest-study-reveals-5038620/) sibling is the funniest, thus having older brothers and / or sisters is great.
1.8.4.7.1.1.1.2. Con: It is not said, that they are more succesfull because they had their parents alone for a while. The reason could also be, that they are jealous of their siblings and now try to win their parents attention through being more successfull. If this would be the case, having siblings would have a positive effect on, at least the older ones.
1.8.4.7.1.2. Pro: Children with siblings always have other kids around to play with.
1.8.4.7.1.3. Pro: Siblings can support each other in different ways than a parent could.
1.8.4.7.1.4. Con: -> See 1.8.4.7.1.1.1.
1.8.4.7.1.5. Pro: They share the burden of elderly care.
1.8.4.7.1.6. Con: The more siblings a child has the less attention it gets from its parents.
1.8.4.7.1.7. Pro: Having many siblings is good for the parents. Siblings educate each other and the parents have less to do.
1.8.4.7.1.8. Pro: [Siblings](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/brothers-social-skills-and-wellbeing-boosted-by-siblings-9795990.html) can learn how to deal with arguments early on in life, which has a positive effect on their social skills later on.
1.8.4.7.1.9. Con: A polygamous family would not necessarily have more children than a monogamous family.
1.8.4.7.2. Pro: Limited ressources have to be spend on more children thus decreasing the share for the individual.
1.8.4.8. Pro: Accounts of children that have grown up in polygamous families are most of the time negative.
1.8.4.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.2.1.1.1.1.
1.8.4.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.2.1.1.1.2.
1.8.4.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.2.1.1.1.3.
1.8.4.8.4. Con: Children of divorced parents have similar negative experiences.
1.8.4.8.5. Con: Existing polygamous families, especially in America, are often cult-like in nature and have flaws outside of just multiple partners being married to one another. If polygamy were legalized, you would have more than just fringe elements like cults and obscure religions participating in it, and it can be safely assumed they'd have wildly different experiences.
1.8.4.8.6. Con: Enumerated examples of negative accounts are not necessarily statistically definitive due to the fallacy of [cherry picking.](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/65/Cherry-Picking)
1.8.4.9. Pro: They will be bullied in school for being from a polygamous family.
1.8.4.9.1. Pro: Children tend to bully people they reagrd as "abnormal" and this would be very special.
1.8.4.9.2. Con: Bullying should not be a factor here. Children might also be bullied when having a gay parent or a disabled parent, etc.
1.8.4.9.2.1. Con: Yes, but it will be bad for the children regardless of the source and thus applicable for polygamy.
1.8.4.9.3. Con: The responsibility lies with the one who bullies; not with the bullied one as it is her / him that makes the selection.
1.8.4.9.3.1. Pro: The top 10 [reasons](http://bullying.about.com/od/Victims/a/10-Reasons-Why-Kids-Are-Bullied.htm) why people do get bullied do not include any parent-related factor but it is more about the individual.
1.8.4.9.3.2. Pro: Typically, the most succesful person gets [bullied](http://www.workplacebullying.org/individuals/problem/who-gets-targeted/). Even though this might be especially true for the workplace it ought to be applicable to school life as well as similar social mechanisms are at work.
1.8.4.9.4. Con: This will only be the case in a society, where having a monogamous relationship is the norm. If everybody would have a polygamous relationship this would not be accurate.
1.8.4.10. Pro: It is mostly religious families that live in polygamous families.
1.8.4.10.1. Pro: To grow up in a religious environment is distorting the worldview of the children.
1.8.4.10.1.1. Pro: Children start to learn that Earth was created by god which runs counter to existing evidence.
1.8.4.10.1.2. Pro: Children are exposed to believe that praying in front of relics helps them to cope with their pain.
1.8.4.10.1.3. Pro: The concept of hell and damnation is traumatizing for children.
1.8.4.10.1.3.1. Pro: Children believe that for bad deeds done or not worshipping God, they are going to burn in a lake of fire for eternity.
1.8.4.10.1.3.2. Pro: [Professor Richard Dawkins](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2312813/Richard-Dawkins-Forcing-religion-children-child-abuse-claims-atheist-professor.html) claims he had been told by a woman that while being abused by a priest was a ‘yucky’ experience, being told as a child that a Protestant friend who died would ‘roast in Hell’ was more distressing.
1.8.4.10.1.4. Pro: Adolescent boys wonder if masturbating is a [sin](http://412teens.org/qna/is-masturbation-a-sin.php).
1.8.4.10.2. Pro: Religious families tend to be less liberal than their atheist counterparts.
1.8.4.10.2.1. Pro: Children need freedom to develop
1.8.4.10.2.1.1. Con: Children however need strict rules as well.
1.8.4.10.3. Pro: Most children do not like church service and religious families tend to go more often to church.
1.8.4.10.4. Con: Religion is not necessarily a bad thing as long as it is not practiced in a radical matter. Most American polygamists however could be described as fundamentalists.
1.8.4.10.4.1. Pro: A longitudinal [study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X07000129) of 2007 found that children of religious parents tend to be more pro-social in their later outlook.
1.8.4.10.4.1.1. Pro: The same study highlights that negative problems only arise when parents are in disagreement over religion. As most polygamous couples will have shared beliefs this is very unlikely.
1.8.4.10.4.2. Pro: A working paper by the German [Institute](http://ftp.iza.org/dp5215.pdf) for Labor found a positive relationship between religious parents and children's health.
1.8.4.10.4.3. Pro: A [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268106000928) of 2007 argued that there is a positive relationship between the level of education and the frequency of church attendance.
1.8.4.10.4.4. Con: We can replace religion with more neutral and deliberately designed [cultural](http://main.zerotothree.org/site/DocServer/Culture_book.pdf?docID=6921) concepts. It is probable that positive effects of religion do fall under 'cultural influences'. A study investigating these effects shows remarkable similarities in terms of cultural importance on child education and social orientation.
1.8.4.10.4.4.1. Pro: Political views, essential to a pro- or con-social attitude of children, are influenced by their parents' political orientation, either [positively](http://www.partirep.eu/sites/default/files/working_paper/document/1194812902.pdf) or [negatively](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2013/05/17/children-with-politically-engaged-parents-are-more-likely-to-deviate-from-their-parents-political-views-in-adulthood/). The socio-political environment was detected as primary variable by this [study](http://www.partirep.eu/sites/default/files/working_paper/document/1194812902.pdf). This suggests, religious orientation is shaped in an equal setting.
1.8.4.10.4.4.1.1. Pro: Societies with higher GDP tend to be more secular than those with a low GDP per capita.
1.8.4.10.4.5. Con: Religion is a special type of ideology. As such, it limits choices of thought, free will and reason to ideology conform actions and beliefs.
1.8.4.10.4.6. Con: It is hard to imagine children would opt voluntarily for a religion later in their life if they would not have been taught so from the very beginning. This indicates a reluctance to join a particular religion; something forced upon them by religious parents.
1.8.4.10.4.6.1. Pro: Forcing a religion upon a child was described as 'child abuse' by Dr. Richard [Dawkins](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2312813/Richard-Dawkins-Forcing-religion-children-child-abuse-claims-atheist-professor.html), former professor at the University of Oxford.
1.8.4.10.4.7. Con: Many religious teachings are rather myths than solid truths and require a third party \(e.g. pope, iman, monk, nun, etc.\) for interpretation. This gives these undemocratic and arbitrarily selected individuals an undue influence over child education.
1.8.4.10.4.8. Pro: Religion typically serves as major tradition for our rites of passage and thus structure life, make transience understandable and therewith enable the individual to make deliberate choices of provided opportunities.
1.8.4.10.4.8.1. Pro: Humans become easily overburdened by an abundance of choices. Rites of passage \(and therewith religion\) help the individual to stay emotionally secured by pre-selecting choices or creating a pecking order of them.
1.8.4.10.4.9. Con: Religion stops children from becoming free spirits.
1.8.4.10.4.9.1. Pro: Religious children are less able to distinguish [fantasy](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-28537149) from reality.
1.8.4.10.4.9.1.1. Con: For kindergarten children to believe in the power of imagination is a positive thing.
1.8.4.10.4.9.1.1.1. Pro: It brings joy in kindergarten to think of being one of the power rangers fighting against the evil monster with your friends who believe the same. This facilitates interpersonal bonds and thus helps to develop a feeling for society.
1.8.4.10.4.9.1.1.2. Pro: Every third child is having an [imaginary](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201301/imaginary-friends) friend, which is totally normal when growing up.
1.8.4.10.4.9.1.2. Con: An imaginative spirit is useful to develop a liberal spirit since it helps to show alternatives instead of being stuck in narrow-minded realities.
1.8.4.10.4.9.1.2.1. Pro: Utopian novels exhibiting a high degree of imagination have proved useful to support liberal values.
1.8.4.10.4.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: 1984 or Fahrenheit 451 have helped protecting our liberal societies from state domination.
1.8.4.10.4.9.1.2.1.2. Pro: Plato's Republic is considered the first utopia and it could be said that only because of it we have liberal values.
1.8.4.10.4.9.1.2.1.3. Pro: Utopias, like the novel Utopia, have helped to create an image of the desired or feared state of nature therewith reinforcing  social forces that fight for this ideas.
1.8.4.10.4.9.1.2.2. Pro: [Arendt](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=bCEvBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=imagination+and+liberal+values&source=bl&ots=V71benmUzE&sig=4cscyv43asuL4HaTtcfBoQgVB6U&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCUQ6AEwA2oVChMIvKWlnNS5xwIVBR6mCh3n2Q0i#v=onepage&q=imagination%20and%20liberal%20values&f=false) argues that imagination works as antidote to totalitarian temptations of politics.
1.8.4.10.4.9.2. Pro: Religious people are [less](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/religious-people-are-less-intelligent-than-atheists-according-to-analysis-of-scores-of-scientific-8758046.html) intelligent.
1.8.4.10.4.9.2.1. Con: The study does not exclude sufficiently socio-economic factors. Poor people just have less access to education while at the same time they are more exposed to religious ideas.
1.8.4.10.4.9.2.2. Con: Religious people are forced to engage in book study \(be it Bible, Qoran or Triptaka\). This trains their brain in the conduct of study and reasoning while at the same time being less exposed to modern distractions like TV or cell phone games.
1.8.4.10.4.9.2.2.1. Con: They can engage in book study and still have enough leisure time to watch [tv](http://wwitv.com/religious_tv/) or play [games](http://www1.cbn.com/family/god-and-gaming%3A-the-invasion-of-christian-video-games). Also there is special religious tv formats and even religious video games.
1.8.4.10.4.9.2.2.1.1. Pro: [Televangelists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1xJAVZxXg&app=desktop) are very popular and appealing to religious people.
1.8.4.10.4.9.2.2.2. Con: Studying myths might be equivalent to study the Lord of the Rings and then preach it as true. There remains doubt that this improves the analytical capacity of the brain.
1.8.4.10.4.9.2.3. Pro: Societies in which the importance of religion is lower exhibit a [higher IQ](http://fringe.davesource.com/Fringe/Religion/Average-intelligence-predicts-atheism-rates-across-137-nations-Lynn-et-al.pdf).
1.8.4.10.4.10. Con: Religion is an ideology that infuses children with values that an outside entity controls to a certain extent. This, religion always takes freedom away from people
1.8.4.10.5. Con: Polygamy is ultimately just marriage in a non-monogamous situation. Marriage exists as a legal and religious institution. There are many more non-religious, non-monogamous people than those who are currently not polygamous only because they have no religious incentive to do so, and because polygamy is not recognized legally. While yes, only religious people are polygamous, you would see much more polygamy if there were a legal incentive to do so.
1.8.4.10.6. Con: [Several](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201401/religious-attitudes-towards-polyamory) [surveys](http://religionnews.com/2015/08/14/polyamory-polygamy-religion-same-sex-marriage-supreme-court-obergefell/) and [studies](https://today.yougov.com/news/2015/08/12/polyamory-taboo-religious-americans/) find that there is a strong negative correlation between religion and practice of non-monogamy. Ethical non-monogamy especially is a primarily secular thing, and in various surveys and personal experiences, I have found more non-monogamous people who practice either no religion or non-Abrahamic religions, such as Buddhism or Paganism.
1.8.4.11. Con: -> See 1.8.4.7.1.
1.8.4.12. Con: Each instance of bad would have to have causality in polygamy and not just correlation. Polygamy often coincides with premature brides, but that is correlative with, not caused by polygamy definitionally.
1.8.4.13. Pro: [Statistically](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13229400.2015.1086405), children are worse off coming from a polygamous background than those raised in 2 parent households.
1.8.4.13.1. Con: ["Although polygynous family structures appear to have detrimental effects on children and adolescents, the mediating effects of parental education, economy and family functioning need to be investigated."](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13229400.2015.1086405)
1.8.4.13.2. Pro: Children raised in polygamous families tend to be [worse](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/84542/1/WRAP_%253A10.1007%252Fs11150-016-9353-x.pdf) [off](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020925123016) than those raised in two-parent households.
1.8.4.13.3. Pro: Children raised in polygamous families have [worse psychological outcomes](http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/19573/7/19573%20AlSharfi%20Pfeffer%20Miller%202015.pdf).
1.8.5. Pro: Polygamous marriages bear a high likelihood of early [widowhood](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/12/17/should-plural-marriage-be-legal/polygamy-is-bad-for-women).
1.8.5.1. Pro: Widows and widowers often tend to be more supported by the state.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: Widows \(in the U.S.\) do not get special funding from the state aside from social security already paid in by their [spouse](https://www.thebalance.com/social-security-for-widows-and-widowers-2388284).
1.8.5.2. Pro: There will be more widows or widowers once the partner dies.
1.8.5.3. Con: The source cited refers to cultural traits in which marriages are arranged between an older husband and a younger wive. Given full rights of women to decide on their partner freely this is unlikely to happen in the Western world and thus the likelihood is reduced.
1.8.5.4. Con: When men and women have an equal number of partners in polygamous arrangements, it would be quite the opposite. If one partner dies, there is still another one left.
1.8.6. Con: Divorces could be prevented if cheating partners were able to convince their current partner to consent to polygamy.
1.8.6.1. Pro: Many people fall in love again and are forced to make a decision between two women or two men. With polygamy this is not necessary.
1.8.6.2. Pro: People in polygamous realtionships do not need to lie to each other, which makes it easier to trust each other.
1.8.6.3. Pro: The stress of having an affair would not occur.
1.8.6.4. Pro: Stress release would happen, because there are more possibilities to have sex.
1.8.6.5. Con: Infidelity is a poor jumping off point in to non-monogamy. If a couple wants to begin with non-monogamy, they should instead begin from an honest and eager foundation. Couples who begin with non-monogamy from an unstable foundation tend to have dramatic and ultimately catastrophic relationships.
1.8.6.6. Con: Using the threat of marrying another person as a way of forcing someone to let you have sex with other people is morally bad.
1.8.7. Con: More people living in the same apartment reduces the need for new buildings and thus helps solving housing shortages.
1.8.7.1. Con: They would need more space as a "big family", thus start to look for a bigger apartment / house.
1.8.7.1.1. Pro: These houses will be much harder to come by, since whole housing, car park, infrastrucures on water, electricity, gas has been calibrated for monogamous families to begin with.
1.8.7.1.2. Con: But even in big houses the number of toilets / rooms / light bulbs / TVs / etc. per person is lower than in single houses where each person has a fully equipped part of his own.
1.8.7.2. Con: This is only true if polygamous marriage follows the example mormons laid out when they practiced polygamy: One husband, many wives.

If wives are also allowed multiple partners, then it is very likely that a marriage would not necessarily lead to everyone living under the same roof, but rather partners scheduling time to spend at each house.
1.8.8. Pro: Polygamy would increase gender inequality and social instability.
1.8.8.1. Con: Polygamy, in its natural definition, does not specify a particular dynamic.  Polyamorous relationships in the west are [female-friendly](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/03/polyamory_and_its_surprisingly_woman_friendly_roots_.html) and most commonly not the 'harem' style but triads  and [polycules](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201405/how-many-polyamorists-are-there-in-the-us) of mixed gender.
1.8.8.2. Con: Poly relationships exist in the west already and partners [are not drawn](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-polyamorous-people-manage-their-finances-in-their-relationships-5553667) to each other by income any more than monogamous partners.  The stability of a larger relationship means there is less pressure for one individual to be wildly successful
1.8.8.3. Pro: It would lead to gender imbalances because polygamy allows high-status men to hoard wives and destabilizes society.
1.8.8.3.1. Con: This only considers polygyny, but not polyandry.
1.8.8.3.2. Con: This does not consider more complex types of plural marriage \(e.g. multi-male multi-female\), or homosexual plural marriage.
1.8.8.4. Pro: The least attractive men will be left without wives.
1.8.8.4.1. Con: This argument suggests men should be entitled to women, as such the argument is sexist.
1.8.8.4.2. Con: There is no right to a partner. If you cannot find one because you are not attractive, rich or smart enough, then it is one own's fault and not that of the system.
1.8.8.4.3. Con: They will find enough equally 'unattractive' women.
1.8.8.4.4. Con: He easily could become the 10th husband of another woman though.
1.8.8.4.5. Pro: Given that polyandry has not developed as mainstream feature in many cultures, there will not be enough women for all men, mathematically speaking, if polygamy were to be allowed.
1.8.8.4.5.1. Con: For polyamorous people, being poly is not a [choice](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2013/10/16/is_polyamory_a_choice.html), just like a monogamous person would have a hard time 'choosing' to be poly \(jealousy would creep in\).  As such poly is like being gay - a spectrum.  Monogamous people will still remain available for and seek out other monogamous partners \(as they already do in the dating scene, when not looking for marriage\).
1.8.8.4.5.2. Con: Polygamy does not specify a male-centric relationship, one-gender-centric, or straight-centric.
1.8.8.4.5.3. Con: LGBT are a common feature of our society and can be the preference for all those who do not find a partner of their first preference.
1.8.8.4.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.4.2.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2. Con: People cannot simply change their sexual preferences.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.1. Con: If a person wants to start changing it \(s\)he is able to do so without much hazzard. Simply do it.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.2. Con: Sexual preferences are not caused by genes and thus are a result of \(self-\)educated and social processes.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.2.1. Pro: If they would be caused by genes, then homosexuality might be rightfully called a genetic problem.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Heterosexuality would be caused by genes as well. Therefore homosexuality would not be a genetic problem, just a different genetic combination. Like the genes, which decide what hair colour one is getting. The genes decides what sex you are attracted to.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.2.1.2. Con: Calling homosexuality as "genetic problem" is a moral determination which is contrary to the [prevailing popular opinion](http://news.gallup.com/poll/1651/gay-lesbian-rights.aspx).
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.3. Pro: A recent [study](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/14/genes-influence-male-sexual-orientation-study) shows, that male sexual orientation is influenced by genes.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.3.1. Con: There is grave uncertainty in this study, which expresses itself in statements like "scientists have no idea which of the many genes in the region are involved" or "the precise mechanism is unclear".
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.3.2. Con: While it might be influenced on the margin the study itself states that they are not decisive in forming sexual orientation.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.3.3. Pro: This [study](http://www.lgbtscience.org/dean-hamer/) confirms the findings of an earlier study which linked homosexuality and genes.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.3.3.1. Con: In 1999, a [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10213693) failed to reproduce the result of this study. So far no other reproduction of these results has been successful.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.3.4. Con: The study has not yet been published and thus lacks scientific scrutiny. This is highly problematic in a field in which the effects of the gene markers have been highly controversial.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4. Pro: Just as people cannot chose who they fall in love with, they most probably cannot chose which sex to like. Romantic feelings and sexual desires are not 'rational'.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.1. Con: At least part of the development of sexual orientation is education based. Influencing this education in direct on one wants can be considered rational.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.1.1. Con: Educational based is the acceptance of the sexual orientation one is having, not the sexual orientation itself.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.1.2. Con: There is a [consensus among medical experts](https://www.lambdalegal.org/sites/default/files/publications/downloads/fs_health-and-med-orgs-stmts-on-sex-orientation-and-gender-identity_1.pdf) that sexual orientation is not a choice.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.2. Con: Taking hormones probably can influence your attraction to men/women.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.2.1. Pro: Hormones have the ability to make us either more manly or womanly.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Masculinity and femininity have [little to do with sexual orientation](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J082v09n01_03?journalCode=wjhm20). To the extent they are relevant, that is the product of social attitudes, not hormones.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.2.2. Pro: Women who are using contraceptives choose men, which are not suitable for them, because their [hormone level](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pill-users-choose-wrong-sex-partners/) has been changed dramatically through the pill.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.2.3. Con: There is no reason to believe that postnatal hormone changes impacts sexual orientation or attraction. [Sexual orientation is determined during gestation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3138231/).
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.2.4. Con: -> See 1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.1.2.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.3. Con: Romantic feelings and falling in love is no accidental encounter but can be deliberately influenced by the individual.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.3.1. Pro: Generally, people fall in love with someone in their general surrounding areas \(social and spatial\). Changing his surrounding will make you more likely to fall in love that you get what you choose.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: It is no accident that musicians very often have musicians as partners while academics often have other academics.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.3.2. Pro: It enhances the [chances](http://www.youramazingbrain.org/lovesex/sciencelove.htm) of falling in love if you tell a complete stranger extremely personal things for 30 minutes and then look into each other's eyes silently for 4 minutes.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.3.3. Con: Love is just a [chemical](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/science-jan-june09-love_02-13/) reaction.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.3.4. Con: -> See 1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.1.2.
1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.4.5.3.2.4.1.2.
1.8.8.4.5.4. Con: Today, without polygamy there are many people who do not have a partner, so the problem is not a general supply-side problem.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1. Pro: Many people today want to be singles.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.1. Con: It is intrinsic to humans to search for / have a partner.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: Humans have a an [inner urge](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-the-name-love/201403/why-we-all-need-belong-someone) to belong with someone. Only a partner can fulfill this.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Faith and a group of people to share it with can fullfill this urge as well. E.g. being a monk or a nun.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.2. Con: Being single is bad for the environment.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.2.1. Pro: Measured in usage per person, single households consume the most space.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Being single does not automatically mean that you live in a single household. You can be single and share a household with friends or family.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: While this could be true, in reality more and more single households are the norm.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.2.2. Pro: Single households cannot exploit economies of scale and therefore create more garbage per person, e.g. need to buy more packages because a single big pack would rot before being finished.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.8.8.4.5.4.1.2.1.1.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.3. Pro: For many people success at work and a high salary are more important than relationships.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.3.1. Pro: Singles are better working machines for the economy.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: Singles are much more flexible and thus can easily relocate to other workplaces.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: Long working hours at night do not conflict with family business.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.3.1.3. Pro: Singles have lower saving rates and thus spend more of their disposable income. This creates positive effects for the economy as it enhances consumption.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.4. Pro: With ongoing emancipation more and more women chose to stay independent, thus  unmarried.
1.8.8.4.5.4.1.5. Pro: Even having children, outside wedlock, has meanwhile become widely accepted in the West.
1.8.8.4.5.4.2. Pro: Many people today have unrealistic standards of attractiveness, that they demand or wish for in a partner.
1.8.8.4.5.4.2.1. Con: But for those getting older will result in reduced demands and thus in a higher propensity to marry.
1.8.8.4.5.4.3. Pro: Many people do not find a match, even though it would exist.
1.8.8.4.5.4.3.1. Con: There is no single big love but \(s\)he can be found in every community and thus passed by every one of us already thousand of times.
1.8.8.4.5.4.4. Pro: Many people like to be unmarried.
1.8.8.4.5.4.4.1. Pro: Marriage by many is seen as relict of the past that comes with gender inequality and significant influence of the church.
1.8.8.4.5.4.4.2. Pro: Uncertainty is a big factor that makes people hesitate and rather opt for a partnership without being married.
1.8.8.4.5.4.4.2.1. Pro: With more information and knowledge people will increasingly be certain that their choices are correct
1.8.8.4.5.4.4.3. Pro: Contrary to the past being married only has limited benefits. Outside of tax and visa reliefs hardly any at all.
1.8.8.4.5.4.4.4. Pro: You can have a fulfilled relationship without a ring on the finger and legal status.
1.8.8.4.5.4.4.5. Pro: Women do not need to be married anymore in order to survive, they can provide for themselves.
1.8.8.4.5.5. Pro: Very attractive men will have greater chances to marry multiple women.
1.8.8.4.5.5.1. Pro: Very rich men, too.
1.8.8.4.5.5.1.1. Pro: It is not uncommon to see older wealthy men with young women. For them polygamy opens not just a legal loophole but also a moral excuse to have more of them.
1.8.8.4.5.5.2. Con: However, attractive men will rather marry women with equal attractiveness.
1.8.8.4.5.5.2.1. Pro: Many men regard women as an accessoire, thus they want an attractive female partner.
1.8.8.4.5.5.3. Con: Since women focus more on [socio-economic](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2337380) factors rather than beauty a man's attractiveness will be easily outweighed when there is the chance to be the only wife of a little less attractive man.
1.8.8.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.8.4.5.5.
1.8.8.4.7. Con: Women do look more for socio-economic status than physical attractiveness as found in a 1990 [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2337380). Thus also the least attractive men can find a wife if they are capable enough.
1.8.8.5. Con: Polygamy consists of both multiple male spouses as well as female spouses. It would give both genders equal ground and ability to enter into such relationships. Social stability does not hinge on marriage stability, otherwise divorce would create instability across society,which it does not.
1.8.8.6. Con: In practice, polygamy tends to undermine gender equality. Legal recognition of polygamy would therefore sanction relationships that tend to subordinate women.
1.8.8.7. Con: Polygamy decreases inequality by reducing gender rolls within the group.
1.8.9. Pro: Polygamy comes along with health risks.
1.8.9.1. Pro: Just by having sexual intercourse with several partners at the same time exposes the individual to severe risks in terms of sexually transmitted diseases.
1.8.9.1.1. Pro: While monogamy is purely stable and cause no risk, Polygamy gives a low possibility for HIV [pedaids.org](http://www.pedaids.org/2015/02/03/solidarity-against-hiv-in-a-polygamous-marriage/)
1.8.9.1.1.1. Con: HIV doesn't come out of nowhere. A faithful disease frree polyamorous marriage has the same risk of infection as a faithful disease free monogamous marriage.
1.8.9.1.2. Pro: It [increases](http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/multiple-sex-partners-greater-risk-cervical-cancer) risks for getting cervical cancer, which is triggered bei HPV.
1.8.9.1.3. Con: When these partners are fixed and tested then no STDs should be involved.
1.8.9.1.3.1. Pro: It is likely that they are aware of each others STDs given the close space and bond they share.
1.8.9.1.4. Con: Being in a polygamous marriage restricts these partners severely in comparison to free floating singles. And we do not equate singles to be at a special health risk.
1.8.9.2. Pro: Polygamy was compared to heavy drinking, gambling or driving too fast by professor Lee [Fitzgerald](http://www.everydayhealth.com/longevity/can-promiscuity-threaten-longevity.aspx).
1.8.9.2.1. Con: Drinking and driving fast can lead to death. Polygamy however cannot.
1.8.9.3. Con: Increases in general health protection mitigate these problems effectively.
1.8.9.3.1. Pro: Condoms and other ways to identify, protect from, and cure sexual transmitted diseases are developed constantly and are widely available.
1.8.9.3.2. Pro: Psychological services provided are increasingly available and socially acceptable.
1.8.9.4. Con: Having many wives is beneficial for men's health as it mitigates stress.
1.8.9.4.1. Pro: Men do not need to think about other women when frustrated with their only wife.
1.8.9.4.2. Pro: By having several wives men can realize their sexual fantasies better
1.8.9.4.2.1. Con: Wide-spread social change should not be implemented merely to sexually gratify heterosexual men.
1.8.9.4.3. Con: Men have to deal with infights among their wives for gratitude of their husband.
1.8.9.4.4. Pro: They have more partners to help them in providing for a financial safety net for the family as a whole. This reduces financial stress.
1.8.9.5. Pro: A [study](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11570638/Polygamy-increases-the-risk-of-heart-disease-study-finds.html) by King Faisal Specialist and Hospital Research Centre in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, found that men with multiple wives have four times the risk of heart disease.
1.8.9.5.1. Con: One of the major factors is running several households. Keeping all wives in one would reduce the stress rate significantly.
1.8.9.5.2. Con: The 'emotional expenses' cited in the study are unlikely to occur when modern Western women decide openly for such an arrangement being aware of its consequences.
1.8.9.6. Pro: A medical study published in the [Croatian Medical Journal](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2205968/) noted that in Africa the temptation for sexual intercourse that has often come with polygamy, regardless of whether a man has multiple wives or vice versa, has been a major contributor to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.
1.8.9.6.1. Con: In Africa the problem is not polygamy but poor education and non-usage of condoms.
1.8.10. Pro: Polygamy can exacerbate existing divisions in society, since it would logically be higher status individuals taking on multiple lower status spouses. If a high status heterosexual individual takes on multiple opposite sex spouses, this reduces the amount of lower status partners for lower status individuals sharing the sexual preference of the high status individual.
1.8.10.1. Con: The same argument can be made for regular marriage.
1.8.10.2. Con: Countries that currently allow polygamy do not experience this problem.
1.8.10.3. Con: Restricting a person's choice to marry someone they consider 'better' to force them to give people 'of their own rank' a shot is against everything free societies stand for.
1.8.11. Pro: [Research has found](http://news.ubc.ca/2012/01/23/monogamy-reduces-major-social-problems-of-polygamist-cultures/) that polygamy exacerbates numerous social problems addressed by monogamy.
1.8.11.1. Con: The article assumes polygamy is only polygyny.
1.8.11.2. Pro: Forms of polygamy where only a few men have more resources would attract more[hypergamous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergamy) women, leading to fights for territory.
1.8.12. Pro: Polygamy [harms women](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Graham50/publication/224943991_A_Comparison_of_Family_Functioning_Life_and_Marital_Satisfaction_and_Mental_Health_of_Women_in_Polygamous_and_Monogamous_Marriages/links/59d9555f458515a5bc262f5a/A-Comparison-of-Family-Functioning-Life-and-Marital-Satisfaction-and-Mental-Health-of-Women-in-Polygamous-and-Monogamous-Marriages.pdf) who participate in it.
1.8.12.1. Con: People are free to make bad choices for themselves.  A woman who voluntarily accepts the trade-offs of polygamy must be free to do so.
1.8.12.2. Con: The article was limited to "a sample of 352 Bedouin-Arab" and as such it's results are restricted to a very specific culture and type of polygamy.  There are multiple kinds and dynamics of poly relationships, including female centric and mixed gender, that are not reflected by this.
1.8.12.3. Con: There are counter [articles](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-sexual-revolution-polyamory/) and [discussion](https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/science-of-polyamory-open-relationships-and-nonmonogamy.html) based on Western culture where poly relationships work. \(Disclaimer: in the West polygamy is largely illegal, as gay marriage was, so research and discussion on alternate poly modes is about partner relationships \)
1.9. Con: People can already date as many people as they like. There is no need for a legal acknowledgment in form of marriage.
1.9.1. Con: Not so long ago inter-racial couples were allowed to date but not marry. Most people today would see that as oppressive. The state should not be able to compromise some consensual adult relationships by denying them the rights freely given to others.
1.9.2. Pro: Marriage is an outdated institution.
1.9.2.1. Pro: It is unreasonable to expect couples to stay together for a lifetime in this day and age.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Many households are now working independently from each other. Contrast this with the old days where they were running a business together, e.g. a farm, and thus were financially interdependent.
1.9.2.1.2. Con: Essential challenges today are the same as they were in the past. Child-raising and founding a family is independent of technology and society.
1.9.2.1.3. Con: A prolonged relationship allows the individual partner to specialize. This specialization leads a couple to enlarge the cake.
1.9.2.1.4. Pro: Most couples start a family for such an obscure factor as 'love' while in the past hard facts such as wealth and status were tantamount for marriage decisions. As love is much more risky and volatile compared to hard facts this creates a shaky basis for relationships.
1.9.2.1.5. Con: With ever fast change of society, family remains one of the few calm waters today and thus allows for psychological rest. Hence, creating a lifetime family is good for couples in terms of mental health.
1.9.2.1.6. Con: Many acquisitions, such as a house, come with substantial financial burdens and sometimes need a lifetime commitment to repay.
1.9.2.2. Con: Legally, marriage represents a more solid and protected base for all parties involved. This should not be denied to people who want to be in a relationship with multiple partners.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: Introduction of extra parties to the contract makes it more complex and less solid.
1.9.2.2.2. Pro: In certain jurisdictions, mutual, materialistic assistance between married people is mandatory in case of need. The welfare state's intervention only comes as a last resort. To enlarge the ties of interpersonal solidarity thus serves the greater good.
1.9.2.2.3. Con: In terms of available partners, polygamy will create a societal imbalance of partners as richer, socially more powerful males will gather wives. This will not simply affect marriage, but partnering in a society overall.
1.9.2.2.3.1. Con: The more equal a society becomes the lesser the gender effects will be.
1.9.2.2.4. Pro: If a spouse of the family were to be injured, members may not be able to go to visit due to not being "married" and may not be able to make medical decisions.
1.9.2.2.5. Pro: It protects all involved partners against inheritance disputes, loss of belongings etc.
1.9.2.2.6. Pro: If it comes to problems in the relationship, marriage may provide a stopcheck for the partners who may decide to work harder on their relationship, being bound together by a legal contract as well as an emotional one.
1.9.2.2.7. Con: [As](http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/open-relationship) open relationships become more accepted, marriage to one person does not have to be restrictive.
1.9.2.2.7.1. Pro: People can already date as many people as they like. There is no reason to deny them legal acknowledgment in form of marriage.
1.9.2.2.7.2. Con: But enhancing the freedom of the individual to do as \(s\)he pleases actually is in favor of an enlightened and self-fulfilled life.
1.9.2.2.7.3. Con: Marriage carries with it certain legal benefits which many polyamorous relationships would like to have distributed to all parties. Marriage between just two members of the relationship could mean that the other spouse\(s\) are not afforded the rights and privileges of a spouse.
1.9.2.2.7.3.1. Pro: As long as society privileges two-person marriage, someone in a polyamorous relationship will be the "lesser" partner unnecessarily.
1.9.2.2.7.3.2. Con: Given that the purpose of recognizing only two person marriages is to encourage certain policy goals, the government cannot recognize relationships that do not advance those goals if they want to make the incentive effective.
1.9.2.2.8. Con: Legalizing polygamy would open the doors for fraud and abuse of government programs that provide the 'protected base'.
1.9.2.2.9. Con: The legal institution of marriage exists to promote certain social policies, for example to promote [stable homes](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13229400.2015.1086405?src=recsys&journalCode=rjfs20) for child-rearing. Polygamous marriage does not promote those policies. It is therefore desirable to deny those benefits polygamous relationships.
1.9.2.2.9.1. Con: The abstract for the [study cited in the claim](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13229400.2015.1086405) states "Although polygynous family structures appear to have detrimental effects on children and adolescents, the mediating effects of parental education, economy and family functioning need to be investigated." The incidence of polygamy and polygyny is [related to underlying socioeconomic factors](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303252577_Polygamy_Polygyny_and_Polyandry_Wiley_Blackwell_Encyclopedia_of_Gender_and_Sexuality_Studies_Nancy_Naples_et_al_ed_Malden_MA_John_Wiley_Sons) that could themselves have negative effects on parenting and child-rearing, independent of family structure.
1.9.2.2.10. Con: The mere fact that marriage benefits those who participate in it does not mean it should be extended to everyone.
1.9.2.2.10.1. Con: Legal marriage is both benefits and commitments \(cost\).  Defining who are 'the [right](https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/act-to-prohibit-the-intermarriage-of-races-1866/#.WxYZ2stlAwA) [people](https://www.history.com/topics/gay-marriage)' to participate in this legal partnership is a constantly [moving bar](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17351133).  It would be easier to stop trying to move the bar and to just allow anyone \(consenting, adult\) willing to take on the [costs](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/taxes/the-tax-pros-and-cons-of-getting-married/article34959872/) to receive the benefits.
1.9.2.2.10.2. Pro: If the principle that marriage should be extended to all those who wish to receive its benefits were applied, the institution of marriage would be meaningless.
1.9.2.2.10.2.1. Con: This seems to suggest that marriage would be made meaningless because many persons would choose to receive benefits from many other persons. However, not all persons would consent to benefit or protect anyone who desired to join them in marriage, since they may not want medical decisions, inheritances, etc. to extend to those persons. Marriage would still have meaning because many persons would still choose not to become married.
1.9.2.2.10.3. Con: The original claim does not specify this as a reason for extending such protections. It could be the fact that human-rights and equality-oriented societies generally wish to extend protections and benefits to as many persons as possible that is relevant, here.
1.9.2.3. Pro: Modern humans do not need an outer confirmation of their decision. They are masters of their own.
1.9.2.4. Pro: Europeans [marry](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Marriage_and_divorce_statistics) later and fewer.
1.9.2.5. Pro: Marriage is an outdated institution, because it is only accessible for heterosexual couples in most countries. Homosexual couples are missing out on the social and finanicial benefits of a marriage.In an open society this should not be the case.
1.9.2.6. Pro: The focus of legal frameworks in a marriage should be focused on whether the couple has a child or not or if they are living together or not. By fact an unmarried couple and a married couple are the same, thus they should both be treated with the same benefits.
1.9.2.7. Con: Marriage is still important in society as a rational view of what a loving committed relationship actually is.
1.9.2.7.1. Pro: Two persons binding themselves together are better able to build something up together. This needs a firm commitment that only marriage and its legal framework can provide.
1.9.2.7.2. Con: Historically, this is not why marriage exists. The marriage institution has in nearly all cultures and societies been primarily about the natural family constituted though procreation.
1.9.3. Con: Marriage is either supported by government or not.  If we dissolve the legal aspect it should be for everyone.  If we maintain it then it should be available to everyone.
1.9.4. Con: Legal recognition has significant impact on current lives of consensual adults in love, and lack of it can cause [significant](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-polyamorists-next-door/201401/the-five-most-common-legal-issues-facing-polyamorists) [harm](https://jessmahler.com/polyamory-children-legal-stuff/).
1.9.5. Con: -> See 1.9.2.2.
1.9.6. Con: -> See 1.9.2.7.1.
1.9.7. Con: A marriage provides better protection for the children involved.
1.9.7.1. Pro: A [study](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/10074614/Almost-no-couples-with-children-who-stay-unmarried-stay-together-study-claims.html) claims that almost no unmarried couples who have children stay together.
1.9.7.1.1. Con: Says the Marriage Foundation. This finding, already by the name of its sponsor, is biased.
1.9.7.1.1.1. Con: These effects were already earlier confirmed in a long range study with 15.000 participants published by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at the British Institute of Education.
1.9.7.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.7.1.1.1.
1.9.7.1.3. Con: Staying together while having an unhappy marriage is [not beneficial](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/when-kids-call-the-shots/201703/4-reasons-why-bad-marriages-are-worse-kids-divorce)for the child either.
1.9.7.2. Pro: Legal [rights](http://www.unmarried.org/parents-children/faq/) are much clearer with than without a marriage.
1.9.7.3. Con: In many instances, polygamous families create larger support structures for children, who may otherwise be neglected.
1.9.8. Con: If we recognize that people should have the right to date as many people as they like, surely these people should also be allowed to opt into marriage as an institution which provides many unique benefits such as legal protection, public recognition and a sense of stability for the parties involved.
1.9.8.1. Con: -> See 1.9.2.2.7.
1.9.9. Con: The fact that so many people choose to marry anyway demonstrates that the institution still has value to individuals.
1.9.9.1. Con: But that is until they decide it is not a good deal anymore and want to run for a better option.
1.9.10. Pro: The costs of expensive legal changes to existing laws and bureaucratic procedures certainly do outweigh the gains of such legal acknowledgment.
1.9.10.1. Con: Enacting the Civil Rights Movement in the US was also expensive. As was the ending of Apartheid in South Africa. The expense of altering bureaucracy should not be used as an excuse for denying any population legal rights freely granted to others.
1.9.10.2. Con: Given the existing infrastructure an amendment is not very expensive as the procedures are already established and do not need to be re-invented.
1.9.10.3. Con: There are many laws amended and passed. Adding another new law will not be a significant burden.
1.9.10.4. Pro: Only few will make use of such a provision and thus no significant gains are likely to accrue.
1.9.10.4.1. Con: [Research statistics](https://www.bustle.com/articles/163468-5-surprising-statistics-about-non-monogamy) tell a different and surprising story. Non-monogamy is a growing culture in America, and more people are interested in trying it than you might think. A lot of the reasons some people DON'T engage in non-monogamy involve the stigma culture has put upon it, which legalizing polygamy would help do away with.
1.9.10.4.1.1. Pro: Even minor research on Facebook shows that at minimum, hundreds of thousands of people actively practice polyamory.
1.10. Pro: Polygamy can have positive consequences for society.
1.10.1. Pro: Polygamy means more children, which is a good thing for society.
1.10.1.1. Con: As married couples enjoy advantages in tax matters, legalizing polygamy and accepting it as legal form of marriage could lead to financial losses for fiscal authorities.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: All arguments for gay marriage between consenting adults also apply here - legal protection, recognition of their partnership, right to raise children, right to visit loved ones in hospitals, religious freedom to a religious bond \(that some religions support\) - these are rights that should not be suppressed for [financial](http://gayagenda.net/marriage.html#money) arguments
1.10.1.1.2. Con: Fiscal authorities do not have to take care of separate files but can group more people together and thus save time when working on it.
1.10.1.1.3. Con: In a society in which everyone would be married the loss would be equally high.
1.10.1.1.4. Con: There are not many who would engage in polygamous marriages.
1.10.1.1.4.1. Pro: Family structures are rigid to social change. Thus legality will not result in many polygamous marriages.
1.10.1.1.4.2. Con: Legalizing polygamy would encourage more people to practice it.
1.10.1.2. Pro: More and more women [do not have children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childlessness). Some polygamous families having many children would offset the reduction and thus act as a stabilizer for society.
1.10.1.3. Con: The propensity to get a child is independent of the fertility in today's society.
1.10.1.3.1. Pro: Birth rates have [declined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate) for years. We can suspect that women are able to get more if they want to.
1.10.1.3.2. Pro: There are technical solutions in case of infertility.
1.10.1.3.3. Con: With higher fertility there will be more unwanted children as one-time accidents are more likely to lead to pregnancy.
1.10.1.3.4. Con: Higher fertility increases the fertile age range.
1.10.1.3.4.1. Pro: There is just more fertility when it declines at older age.
1.10.1.3.5. Con: Women thinking they are infertile will be less sensitive to proper [contraception](http://www.prochoiceforum.org.uk/ri1.php) and therewith enhance the likelyhood of pregnancy.
1.10.1.3.6. Con: Women have more often sex when their [fertility is high](http://www.prochoiceforum.org.uk/ri1.php). This increases chances of becoming pregnant.
1.10.1.3.7. Pro: There are fertile married couples that do not get children.
1.10.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.7.
1.10.1.5. Con: More children from polygamous families can be very expensive for the taxpayer. For example, Canadian polygamist Winston Blackmore collects child-care [benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Blackmore) for 145 children.
1.10.1.5.1. Con: Child-care benefits will enhance educational levels of children and thus the long-term benefits for society at large.
1.10.1.5.2. Con: Regardeless of what they do, children will be likely tax payers later on and thus offset initial benefits recieved.
1.10.1.5.3. Con: 145 children coming steaming from monogamous marriages would be viewed as normal. It is unfair to treat polygamously born children differently and consider them as burden while other children as the future.
1.10.1.6. Pro: It could be a good method to fight the demographic change in some countries.
1.10.1.6.1. Pro: It could help counter the shortage of specialists.
1.10.1.6.1.1. Con: There are better and more efficient ways to tackle the shortage
1.10.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Allow immigrants to get their diploma, education, and previous work experience respected so that they can continue in their profession.
1.10.1.6.2. Pro: Statistically, the chance to get a woman pregnant is bigger if you have several partners for intercourse.
1.10.1.6.2.1. Con: You do not have to be married to several partners to give birth to more children.
1.10.1.6.2.1.1. Con: For conservatives giving birth to children without being married is a no-go.
1.10.1.6.2.1.2. Pro: You can just have non-binding sexual intercourse with a lot of changing sex partners.
1.10.1.6.2.1.2.1. Con: Becoming pregnant from an unknown one-night stand is likely to have negative repercussions, such as raising the child alone completely void of any contact to the father.
1.10.1.6.2.1.2.2. Con: If you are not in a firm relationship the chances are higher that sex partners use a condom for protection.
1.10.1.6.2.1.3. Con: Marriage would mean, having a certain safety to not be alone with the child.
1.10.1.6.2.1.3.1. Con: The [divorce to marriage ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_demography) is 44% in the EU and 53% in the USA. This is no high percentage of stability and includes features of gambling.
1.10.1.6.2.1.3.1.1. Con: The number of marriages divorced after the children left home is probably higher than among those couples that still are in the process.
1.10.1.6.2.1.3.2. Pro: It is easier to raise a child with a partner to count on.
1.10.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.10.1.6.2.1.
1.10.1.7. Con: People can be in polygamous marriages and still use birth control.
1.10.1.8. Con: Bringing up children is expensive.
1.10.1.8.1. Con: In polygamous families there would be more money, as there are more members able to work.
1.10.1.8.1.1. Pro: In polyandrous families several men could make earnings for one wife and her children.
1.10.1.8.1.2. Con: In polygynous families there would be only one man providing for several housewives.
1.10.1.8.1.2.1. Con: The women are not neccessarily housewives, they could be earning money as well.
1.10.1.8.1.3. Pro: Family members are able to better specialize in certain tasks and therewith enhance the output of the family as a whole, e.g. one member being designated for childcare; another for keeping garden and house intact; the rest for working.
1.10.1.8.2. Con: Those costs are not covered by society but by individual families and thus only create positive externalities for the society as a whole.
1.10.1.8.2.1. Pro: With many children public transportation systems in the countryside survive. These can be used by the elderly who do not pay for the children.
1.10.1.8.3. Pro: Bringing up a child in the U.S. costs nearly [$100.000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_raising_a_child).
1.10.1.8.4. Con: Economies of scale do work with families as well. Thus, every additional child costs less.
1.10.1.8.5. Pro: If it would not be expensive many parents would probably opt for more children.
1.10.1.8.6. Pro: Not only direct costs are created but often one partner needs to manage the household and thus foregoes a potential income for the family.
1.10.1.8.7. Con: The bringing up of children is creating consumption, which is necessary to keep the economy flowing.
1.10.1.8.8. Con: A country is in need of children to replace aging workforce and consume. This makes it an investment which will pay back later.
1.10.2. Pro: Polygamy makes life easier for the ones involved.
1.10.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.10.2.2. Con: -> See 1.8.4.4.
1.10.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.10.2.4. Pro: Having a built in support system that can take over if one member is going through a rough time, is a great opportunity.
1.10.2.5. Pro: In polygamist marriages you are surrounded by people that are dealing with the same issues and emotions that you are. This is a wonderful form of support for all types of problems.
1.10.2.5.1. Con: There is much distrust in polygamous marriages.
1.10.2.5.1.1. Pro: Divorced polygamous women report [negatively](http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/polyamorous-relationships) of their experience and the mistrust that was present between the different wives.
1.10.2.6. Pro: With more than one mom / dad in the house, the responsibility does not fall on any one person. Things like chores, meal prep and child watching can be split among multiple people, easing the burden for everyone.
1.10.2.6.1. Con: More adults and children in the house lead to more chores.
1.10.2.6.1.1. Con: But the marginal added chores will be smaller with every person.
1.10.2.6.2. Pro: Having many husbands reduces the workload women face and thus enhances their quality of life.
1.10.2.6.2.1. Pro: In a couple household women tend to be overly burdened by sharing responsibilities, such as cleaning the house, which leads them to have a higher workload and thus an unhappier life.
1.10.2.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.4.4.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.8.5.
1.10.4. Con: -> See 1.8.4.
1.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.
1.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.
1.10.7. Pro: Polygamy comes with economic advantages.
1.10.7.1. Pro: As married couples enjoy advantages in tax matters, legalized polygamy could have positive effects for a wider range of people.
1.10.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.1.
1.10.7.1.2. Con: Everyone is allowed to participate in marriage, if they so choose, as it is.
1.10.7.2. Pro: Not only the work load is shared but the finances would be as well. More family members could generate income, while some family members could remain home to care of the children, thus eliminating expensive child care costs and at the same time increased the family income.
1.10.7.2.1. Con: There is a risk of family legacy being scattered down much more family branches than before, leading to empoverishment of some families in the long run.
1.10.7.3. Con: Whatever economic advantages to polygamy there are would be confined to those within the relationship. This ignores the effect of polygamy on society.
1.10.7.4. Con: Polygamous families are disproportionately impoverished.
1.10.7.4.1. Con: Rich polygams have existed and still exist today.
1.10.8. Pro: Legalizing polygamy could reduce expenses for programs like food stamps \(in polygamy rich areas like Utah\) because only one wife is "Married" thus making the others "single mothers" on paper. So rather than the state paying $600/mo to 8 "single mothers" They could be giving one very large family unit $2500/mo. Due to the "closed ranks" nature of these communities, there is no concrete way to know how many hundreds or even thousands are working these systems to their benefit. [byustudies.byu.edu](https://byustudies.byu.edu/file/3134/download?token=Z0uN7mBm)
1.10.8.1. Con: Polygamous families disproportionately live in [poverty](http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2012/05/5338/).
1.10.8.2. Pro: It is not the governments responsibility to fund these exceedingly large family units, which can easily include upwards of 20 children. These families would still qualify for assistance, however it would place more responsibility on the families and their close community to support themselves.
1.11. Pro: A restriction to monogamy is also a restriction of human nature and may therefore not be made.
1.11.1. Pro: Monogamy is nothing more than a social construct. In fact polygamy is practiced in much more societies worldwide than monogamy.
1.11.1.1. Pro: Legislation ought to resemble lifestyle; not the other way round.
1.11.1.2. Con: For prevailing sequential monogamous practices, the legislation should allow for more flexibility in existing structures rather than adoption of entirely new categories.
1.11.1.2.1. Con: There is in practice not much difference between several at a time and one at a time several times. Flexibilities in current system would add more legal constraint \(to allow both systems to coexist within same relationship\) with little practical difference.
1.11.1.2.2. Pro: Most people still live monogamous, but just have changed partners. This makes them not polygamous, but just monogamous in a different way.
1.11.1.3. Pro: There are many societies in which polygamy is [legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy).
1.11.1.4. Pro: Sexuality in general is just socially constructed. This includes the decision for monogamous or polygamous relationships.
1.11.1.4.1. Pro: We put sexuality into legal concepts that are mutually exclusive, i.e. one is either man or women. This creates not only administrative categories but also shapes expectations of citizens. This ignores the existence of cases in between such as hermaphrodites.
1.11.1.4.2. Con: Sexuality cannot be completely constructed by social pressure due to distinct and nearly universal biological attributes.
1.11.1.5. Con: Every sexuality is created under social pressure and thus is a social construct. This does not automatically mean it is a restriction of human nature since then human nature would not exist given omnipresent restrictions.
1.11.1.5.1. Pro: The only domain where there are little or no restrictions could be identified in white male's sex tourism to 'colored' countries because they act from a position of extreme power \(as seen by [Cynthia Enloe](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Bananas_beaches_bases.html?id=F32hQgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y)\). But even here we could argue that in such a space these men act balancing to the restrictions they experienced before and thus do not act out of a sense of pure 'human nature'.
1.11.1.6. Con: Monogamy emerged dominant for a reason and is thus more than just a social construct.
1.11.1.6.1. Con: Monogomy emerged dominant through enforced religious doctrine, not natural selection.  Same as how European culture 'emerged dominant' over other cultures through military conquest.  The success of enforcing something does not translate to the inherent value of what is oppressed.  'Might does not make Right'.
1.11.1.6.2. Pro: Polyamorous relations in low movement remote places could lead to higher risk of consanguinity and could be harmful in the long run.
1.11.1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.11.1.6.4. Con: This kind of argument could be used for anything. Society as a whole is changing constantly, thus it is also possible that monogamy is not suitable anymore.
1.11.2. Pro: There are precedences in all religions influencing European culture, i.e. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
1.11.2.1. Con: Stronger than religion, Europe has been much more influenced by its tradition. In this tradition polygamy is prohibited.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: Polygamy was a [part](https://www.quora.com/Was-polygamy-ever-part-of-any-pre-Christian-European-culture-Or-is-it-more-of-a-Middle-Eastern-cultural-thing) of [pre-Christian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_law) [Europe](http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/2001/02/polygamy-not-as-rare-as-you-may-think.aspx) in [many](https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/23510/when-did-monogamy-become-the-norm-in-ancient-greece) [places](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy_in_Christianity) in Europe.  The tradition discussed came about [because of](https://www.polygamy.com/articles/24411273/history-of-polygamy) the spread of [Roman](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2015/03/monogamy-isnt-biblical-its-roman.html) [Christianity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy_in_Christianity) and it's enforcement through state law and [severe punishment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition#Bigamy).  It did not evolve as part of natural European principals.
1.11.2.1.2. Pro: Religion is only a part of tradition and therefore subjugated by it. Some ancient stories about some polygamous historical persons do not qualify to jeopardize the traditional construct of 2000 years of European civilization.
1.11.2.2. Con: Actually, church practices have favored monogamous marriages.
1.11.2.2.1. Con: Redistribution of wealth to church once familiy dies could be a reason for this. Polygamy means larger and more sustainable offspring, having little chance to go extinct, meaning family wealth carried on as long as at least one male descendant was still alive and reproducing.
1.11.2.2.2. Pro: It is not allowed to marry a second person.
1.11.2.2.3. Pro: When King Henry VIII of England wanted to get another wife, he had to fight the church for it.
1.11.2.3. Pro: [Jacob](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob) had four wives.
1.11.2.3.1. Con: There is no historical evidence to support the actual existence of Jacob as described in the Bible.
1.11.2.3.1.1. Con: Christian beliefs have been used as a reason to ban polygamy \(in discussions and in the case of Mormonism\).  The Bible is considered canon by that belief, so the things in it matter to discussion unless Christianity / religion is removed as a reason to oppose polygamy
1.11.2.4. Pro: King [David](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David) had eight wives.
1.11.2.5. Pro: [Muhammed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad's_wives) had 12 wives.
1.11.2.6. Con: Whether certain religions once accepted polygamy is irrelevant. Many religions at one time accepted morally reprehensible practices. For example, killing non-believers.
1.11.3. Pro: People can already date as many people as they like. There is no reason to deny those relationships legal acknowledgement.
1.11.3.1. Con: Dating and marriage are different for extremely important reasons. There are a plethora of responsibilities, obligations, rights, and duties that exist in current legal marriages that are not prevalent in dating relationships.
1.11.3.1.1. Con: Legal acknowledgement \(making it not illegal\) does not mean legal full recognition. It means for example that even if polyamorous marriages do not exist, it is not considered a problem or a breach of monogamous contract.
1.11.3.1.2. Con: Responsibilities around contractual mariage are not incompatible with polyamorous type of relationships, dating or marriage.
1.11.4. Con: [The](http://www.livescience.com/49690-humans-naturally-monogamous-promiscuous.html) view of human nature which states humans are not naturally monogamous rejects this statement.
1.11.4.1. Pro: A restriction to monogamy violates human rights.
1.11.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.11.4.1.2. Con: [In](http://dailysignal.com/2015/07/29/born-225-years-ago-tocqueville-predicted-the-tyranny-of-the-majority-in-our-modern-world/) democracies, as long as the majority of society does not want to redefine marriage, the tyranny of the majority can prevail.
1.11.4.1.2.1. Pro: [Each](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1770&context=ilj) nation has the sovereign right to make and enforce national law.
1.11.4.1.2.1.1. Con: The right to pass laws does not mean a nation does not self-restrict, in keeping with it's principals and will of the governed.  If a country's principals separate church and state then it is reasonable it would not support laws based solely on one religion's principals
1.11.4.1.2.1.2. Con: It is not a good thing to sustain a political framework if the price is suppression of freedoms for the individual.
1.11.4.1.2.1.3. Pro: Social policies such as these are not discussed on EU level but do fall within the scope of national policies, just like abortion or gay marriages.
1.11.4.1.2.2. Con: Consenting adults should be free to do whatever they want, as long as nobody else gets hurt by their actions.
1.11.4.1.2.2.1. Con: Affecting marriage markets might hurt others so that they cannot find a proper partner.
1.11.4.1.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.8.4.2.
1.11.4.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Polygamous societies make finding a partner easier. The ones that are already normally taken, are now available.
1.11.4.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Polygamy [intensifies competition](http://news.ubc.ca/2012/01/23/monogamy-reduces-major-social-problems-of-polygamist-cultures/) for marital partners and makes finding a partner harder.
1.11.4.1.2.2.2. Con: It is technically impossible for everyone to live in such a way.
1.11.4.1.2.2.2.1. Con: If the number of marriages in polygamy and polyandry is equal with both having an equal amount of partners it is technically possible.
1.11.4.1.2.2.2.2. Con: There is no need to everyone live that way, the idea is that the ones whom want to live that way be supported by the government.
1.11.4.1.2.2.3. Con: Given the complex emotions involved in such a situation people need to be protected by the government from doing something stupid, they might regret several decades later.
1.11.4.1.2.2.3.1. Con: Although this might be an image some people have, the government's role is not to replace that of parents. Citizens considered "adults" \(under law\) are alone responsible for their decisions and actions, no matter how stupid or far reaching.
1.11.4.1.2.2.3.1.1. Con: It is prohibited to use drugs which would merely hurt oneself.
1.11.4.1.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Drug businesses feed into general organised crimes structures and thus are detrimental to society at large.
1.11.4.1.2.2.3.1.2. Con: The government can proscribe citizens to wear a seatbelt to protect themselves.
1.11.4.1.2.2.3.1.3. Con: By detailing how the duties of citizens are implemented into actual law the government is proscribing the will of the individual and forces their decisions and actions.
1.11.4.1.2.2.4. Pro: Polygamy does not hurt society in any way, thus it should not be legally prohibited.
1.11.4.1.2.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.10.1.1.
1.11.4.1.2.2.4.2. Pro: Any legal prohibition is meant to either protect people from any kind of danger or to protect people from themselves. Polygamy neither hurts other people nor the people practicing it and may therefore not be illegal.
1.11.4.1.2.2.4.2.1. Con: The children of these marriages will be hurt and thus there is a responsibility for the government.
1.11.4.1.2.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Children can enjoy loving and caring parents in a monogamic family as well as in a polygamic family. There is no reason why children might face a higher risk of getting hurt in polygamic families.
1.11.4.1.2.2.4.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.4.
1.11.4.1.2.2.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.8.
1.11.4.1.2.2.4.2.3. Con: -> See 1.8.12.
1.11.4.1.2.2.4.2.4. Con: -> See 1.8.4.13.3.
1.11.4.1.2.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.11.4.1.2.2.4.2.
1.11.4.1.2.2.6. Pro: The state should not interfere with love / relationship matters.
1.11.4.1.2.2.6.1. Con: Reproduction is a social endeveaor and thus falls into the indirect competences of government.
1.11.4.1.2.2.6.1.1. Pro: The state governs heritage regulations to safeguard reproduction.
1.11.4.1.2.2.6.1.2. Pro: The society chose to use the traditional family as basic unit and best mode of reproduction and in the constitution committed itself to protect this unit.
1.11.4.1.2.2.6.2. Pro: Everyone should have the full right to engage in private conduct without government intervention.
1.11.4.1.2.2.6.2.1. Con: Where private conduct implicates governmental benefits and has significant social impact, it is appropriate for the government to intervene and regulate that conduct.
1.11.4.1.2.2.6.3. Con: The determination of who receives legal benefits provided by the government is a matter of social and governmental concern.
1.11.4.1.2.2.6.4. Con: The state already regulates a variety of relationship-related issues where it deems social interests to be implicated, for example: prostitution, domestic abuse, exploitation of children, and child abuse/neglect.
1.11.4.1.2.2.7. Pro: Sex with more partners at the same time is fun and does not hurt anybody. Thus it should be legal to fix it through the bond of matrimony.
1.11.4.1.2.2.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.4.1.2.2.4.2.
1.11.4.1.2.2.8. Pro: Fundamentally, a marriage is a form of contract between consenting adults, what right the state has to intervene with such activities when no third party is effected is questionable
1.11.4.1.2.3. Con: The tyranny of the majority is called that for a reason- it suggests the majority is oppressing the minority to support its own interests. The fact that majority votes will go against polygamy and non-monogamy does not change the inherent morality behind polygamous marriage.
1.11.4.1.2.4. Con: Same-sex marriges in USA was allowed not by the will of majority. Majority can't impose it's view on the minority when no compelling social interest exist. So polygamy can and should be allowed regardless of the majority position.
1.11.4.1.3. Pro: Humans are biologically nonmonogamous.
1.11.4.1.3.1. Con: While modern humans may exhibit tendencies towards polygamy, newer genetic research shows that we are generally [monogamous](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100302112018.htm).
1.11.4.1.3.2. Con: Saying that nonmongamy is natural, in support of polygamy, is an [appeal to nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature), which is a logical fallacy. Whether something is "natural" is irrelevant to whether it is morally good or desirable.
1.11.4.1.4. Con: Polygamous marriages tend to perpetuate gender inequality and subordinate women. Legal recognition of polygamous relationships would grant legitimacy to that subordination and undermine human rights.
1.11.4.1.4.1. Con: In many polygamist marriages, women were freed up to seek education and be more autonomous due to their shared responsibilities with other wives while still having a large family.
1.11.4.1.4.2. Con: Polygamy is more than just polygyny. It would contribute to sexual liberation of the women given that it would be acceptable for them to have many partners.
1.11.4.2. Con: -> See 1.11.1.6.
1.11.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.7.
1.11.5. Con: [Stating](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/131/Naturalistic_Fallacy) something should be legal just because it is natural is fallacious.
1.11.6. Pro: Love and the desire for marriage exists beyond the traditional one man and one woman model that the US government has followed in the past.
1.12. Con: The legalization of polygamy would come along with legal and procedural challenges in federal constructs like the European Union.
1.12.1. Pro: A legalisation for each country alone would be detrimental for the social fabric of federal decision making.
1.12.1.1. Con: Discrimination is not something that should be supported simply because it would be inconvenient to change, or because 'it's how we do things'.  This had been challenged successfully with racism, women's rights, and gay rights already, and all the same arguments are being made for this.
1.12.1.2. Pro: It would arouse suspicion among European partners if one member state would legalize polygamy without asking its European partners.
1.12.1.2.1. Con: Poly would fall under '[shared competences](https://ec.europa.eu/info/about-european-commission/what-european-commission-does/law/areas-eu-action_en)' : '[security and justice](https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights_en)' : '[combating discrimination](https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination_en)' which the EU allows individual nations to regulate, provided [there are not](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/civil-justice/family-law/marriage-civil-partnerships-and-property-issues_en) existing EU-level laws opposing this.
1.12.1.3. Pro: It might change the conclusions reached by European Commission and the Court of European Human Rights in regard to family reunion policies. This has repercussions on other EU members and thus should not be taken without their consent or at least involvement
1.12.1.3.1. Pro: So far polygamous families are not allowed to bring all spouses with them as [Bibi v UK](http://caselaw.echr.globe24h.com/0/0/united-kingdom/1992/06/29/bibi-v-the-united-kingdom-1347-19628-92.shtml) illustrates. However, a change in European attitude might allow the Court to conclude that there is no more any monogamous community to protect and thus the UK's refusal illegal.
1.12.1.4. Con: -> See 1.11.4.1.2.1.2.
1.12.1.5. Con: -> See 1.11.4.1.2.1.3.
1.12.2. Pro: The majority of countries currently utilizes a framework of legal unions based on monogamous marriages. Lots of laws - for example rules regarding divorce or inheritance - would need to be reviewed and possibly changed.
1.12.2.1. Pro: The benefits for a major reform are not outweighing the effort.
1.12.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.1.1.4.
1.12.2.2. Con: Instead of revising existing legislation to marriages an own and new category for polygamous relationships could be introduced with different components than existing laws on legal unions.
1.12.2.2.1. Pro: Much of the criticism could be met by making polygamous marriages different in terms of family law.
1.12.2.3. Pro: There are no blueprints for what features and principles should apply to polygamous relationships and thus would have to be debated in time and resource consuming manner.
1.12.2.3.1. Pro: Existing frameworks allowing polygamy, mainly in the Middle East, are based on a different conception of man and woman and are thus not a good or desirable blueprint.
1.12.2.3.1.1. Con: Nevertheless a study of them can bring many advantages for policymakers to at least set some benchmarks of what might be beneficial, e.g. in the field of inheritance law, and what has to be excluded for sure, e.g. unequal divorce law.
1.12.2.4. Pro: Polygamous marriages would confront decision-makers with severe legal problems that would need to be solved on how to accommodate existing provisions to more partners at the same time.
1.12.2.4.1. Con: Governments could easily solve these challenges by eliminating all legal distinctions that are based on someone's marital status. In the eyes of the government and for purposes of policy, individuals would just be individuals. Marriage would then be a private matter between the spouses, their family and friends, and their church \(if they have one\).
1.12.2.4.2. Pro: In case of divorce the question of guilt has to be defined in different ways than in couple marriages.
1.12.2.4.2.1. Pro: It has to be clarified if a change in mindset to end a polygamous lifestyle constitutes a reason that would reduce later alimony.
1.12.2.4.3. Pro: Property regimes among multiple and flexible spouses would need different arrangement than regular marriages.
1.12.2.4.3.1. Pro: Since additional partners can enter the relationship a fixed percentage from the start of the marriage to the end is not applicable and another regime has to be invented.
1.12.2.4.4. Pro: It would have to be clarified to what extend stepmothers/stepfathers are responsible in case of divorce for the child their ex partner had.
1.12.2.4.5. Pro: The provisions of  divorce by mutual agreement touches upon the question if in a polygamous marriage all partners are connected binary or if they have one overarching marriage.
1.12.2.5. Con: Just because it is a lot of effort, does not mean that we should not do it.
1.12.2.5.1. Con: A government ought to use its resources as efficient as possible. Discussing a highly emotional topic like polygamy would require much time to find a consensus. Time that is needed for more urgent problems.
1.12.2.5.1.1. Con: If this is the case the government needs reform. In autocratic regimes it works, too. The efficiency of an autocracy should be aspired by a democracy.
1.12.2.5.1.1.1. Con: In autocratic regimes there is no "discussing to find a consensus", so this comparison cannot be upheld. Discussing and finding a consensus \(of the majority\) is what defines a democracy.
1.12.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Also in autocratic regimes there is a discussion between society and leadership. After all without making policies that are appreciated revolution is likely.
1.12.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Chinese leadership is highly aware of what the people want and think in order to satisfy the demands before they become threatening to the regime itself.
1.12.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In a recent book by Fang on [China's democratic path](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662473429) he argues that this characteristic of listening to the people has to be considered democratic or at least proto-democratic.
1.12.2.5.1.1.1.2. Con: Also in democratic societies governments might act against the wish of society.
1.12.2.5.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: A state might be forced from outside to act in a certain way.
1.12.2.5.1.2. Con: Discussions need time but are essential for a democracy to work and result in better compromises.
1.12.2.6. Con: Laws that entailed similar amount of norm / law changes have made it into the laws.
1.12.2.6.1. Pro: Laws regarding gay marriage.
1.12.2.6.2. Con: Those laws had a bigger magnitude in terms of applicable cases and hence more relevance justifying major changes and costs attached.
1.12.2.6.3. Pro: Laws regarding the legalization of abortion.
1.12.3. Con: Federal constructs face challenges regardless because of new laws, treaties, and international developments.
1.12.3.1. Pro: Due to federal organizations [evolving](http://www.ushistory.org/gov/8a.asp) to remain effective, they are equip to deal with the obstacles of evolving marriage practices.
1.12.4. Con: All legal changes have the same effect, abolishing slavery probably was very difficult legally, decolonisation was complicated too, women's emancipation was probably tough.
1.13. Pro: -> See 1.9.2.2.
1.14. Con: Conferring and navigating the legal rights conferred by polygamy to multiple partners vis-a-vis themselves would be unworkable.
1.14.1. Con: Issues over legal rights occur between two partner marriages as well.  These situations are not unworkable, but sometimes involve going to court.
1.14.2. Pro: During medical emergencies swift decision making is often necessary. So, a legal stalemate could be harmful to an injured spouse.
1.14.2.1. Con: Not giving loved ones any rights in medical decisions is more troubling then giving more than one person rights. The question already exists anyway for spouse vs parents, and a living will solves it
1.14.2.2. Con: A child with two parents often find themselves in these situations, yet we are able to get past that.  This would therefor be an argument about normal marriage.
1.14.2.3. Con: It is relatively easy to create a living will to avoid such incidents.  Which also assures that someone else is not making a choice for you as well.
1.14.3. Pro: Polygamy will create paralyzing situations for the deciding spouses when they disagree about exercising a right over another partner.
1.14.3.1. Pro: As an example, three married individuals with two spouses deciding the medical fate over their spouse who is in comatose or vegetative state.
1.14.3.2. Con: This is currently the case in many situations involving traditional situations and children.
1.14.3.3. Con: It is currently possible for the spouse to disagree with the parents of the person afflicted and end up with the courts making a choice.
1.14.4. Con: This is only because the current system regulating marriage is already deeply flawed, overly complicated, and artificially difficult to leave.
1.14.4.1. Con: The point of government-recognized marriage is to give formal recognition to a relationship that is intended to be taken seriously by all parties. That is why tax breaks, estate rights, and other legal advantages are given in the context of marriage. Its complicated because its serious. Its difficult to leave because its serious.
1.14.5. Con: Just because it's difficult, doesn't mean it shouldn't be done.
1.14.6. Con: It is perfectly possible to recommend polygamy by removing any \(or most\) legal recognition/"rights" from the act of marriage in any case. \(E.g., allowing contractual obligations that stipulate partners, registering any person\(s\) as people allowed to visit/contact in hospitals, etc., allowing joint-bank accounts to be made between any two or more people, etc.\).
1.14.7. Con: No evidence is presented as to why it would be unworkable. For instance, during a medical emergency, the legal policy could simply be that any partner in the marriage who is present is able to make decisions. If multiple partners are present, there could be an order of priority. The framework of chains-of-command works well in the military and could easily apply to legal arrangements for polygamous groups.
1.15. Pro: If polygamy is illegal then cultures which include polygamy are in effect discriminated against.
1.15.1. Con: Some cultures need to be discriminated against. There's countries where it's legal to marry children. Those cultures need to be discriminated against.
1.15.1.1. Con: While certain aspects of a culture or implementations of an idea can be a contradiction to another culture's beliefs, this does not generalize to discriminating against the entire culture and everything in it.
1.15.1.2. Con: This is a cultural difference we are talking about. However despicable on certain point of views, if it is widely accepted by the said local population, it’s harder to argue against it.
1.15.1.3. Con: If we really have to take extreme examples we have to put a hierchy on them to see where claim starts to apply or not. We can argue That when parts of culture restrict liberties \(marrying non conscent kids\) instead of expanding them \(conscented polyamorous marriages\), these parts of cultures shoud be discriminated against. But this means polygamy should not be discriminated against.
1.15.2. Pro: [Those](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-winkler/are-polygamy-bans-unconst_b_4454076.html) in multi-person relationships do not have the same rights as legally married couples in a nations where polygamy is illegal.
1.15.2.1. Con: This can also apply to many potential societal differences not just pertaining to marriage.
1.15.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.3.1.
1.15.2.3. Con: This claim merely observes a reality rather than advancing an argument. Whether the denial of those rights is good or bad is the question of debate here.
1.15.3. Con: -> See 1.11.4.1.2.1.
1.15.4. Con: The claim assumes its own conclusion \(that polygamy is good\). For those who believe polygamy is bad, there is no problem discriminating against it, as bad practices should be discriminated against.
1.15.5. Con: Not all cultures or cultural practices are deserving of respect.
1.15.5.1. Con: Respect is a choice, laws are a restriction on rights.  A person does have to respect someone's religion or home life in order to respect their right to have it \(as long as it is consensual and doesn't directly affect anyone who did not conscent\)
1.16. Pro: -> See 1.11.4.1.
1.17. Con: The government has no compelling interest to sanction or incentivize any type of marriage, including polygamy.
1.17.1. Con: Government interests in sanctioned marriage include but are not limited to taxation, record keeping, limitation of mobility, stabilization of income, cutting cost in health care,... etc.
1.17.2. Con: Under certain legal orders \(e.g. Switzerland\) the spouse is first responsible for providing and caring for his/her partner in case the latter is in need. The welfare state should only intervene as a last resort. Encouraging boarder
1.17.3. Pro: Marriage itself should not be recognised in law but should rather be a private practice much like a baptism, for example. Private polygamous marriages already exist and are not illegal. Therefore, polygamous marriage should not be legalised.
1.17.3.1. Con: A practice that is allowed but not legal is unfairly disadvantaged compared to a similar practice that is both allowed and legal.
1.17.3.2. Pro: The state is an illegitimate authority, therefore its laws are illegitimate.
1.17.3.2.1. Con: One's views of the merit of government authority make no pragmatic difference; enforcement of laws affects us voluntarily or not, therefore "legalize polygamy" is an example of working to make government conform to our ideals.
1.17.3.3. Con: Marriage affords with it several legal advantages. Also, while polyamorous dating is not illegal in most places per se, there are numerous places in which polyamorous cohabitation is explicitly illegal, and polygamous relationships often encounter additional obstacles to adoption, child custody, and other legal matters pertaining to their children.
1.18. Pro: The government should not interfere in the internal affairs of consenting adults.
1.18.1. Con: Consenting adults aren't obliged to get the government in on their interpersonal relationships.  A marriage is an invitation for government to interfere in your personal life.
1.18.2. Pro: Governments should not prioritize certain forms of relationships over others.
1.18.2.1. Pro: [As](http://theweek.com/articles/475141/how-marriage-changed-over-centuries) the practice of marriage evolves so too must the legal definition evolve.
1.18.2.2. Con: -> See 1.11.4.1.2.
1.18.2.3. Pro: Individuals opt into relationships because these bring unique and profound meaning to their lives.
1.18.2.4. Pro: Citizens should be able to actualize the varying forms of relationships which they value.
1.18.2.5. Con: Governments should be able to incentivize outcomes that benefit society as a whole. Marriage as a legal institution is designed to achieve certain social goals, and so the government should be able to give those legal rights only those relationships that further those goals.
1.18.2.5.1. Pro: Some societies \(e.g. south european countries\) rely on families bonds instead of the social system to support sick people. To facilitate these bonds they incentivize families by tax cuts. If some types of relationships break up easily and do not support sick family members as much, they should not be incentivized in the same way by society, because they have less value for it.
1.18.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.4.1.2.2.
1.18.4. Con: Marriage is a government institution that confers certain legal rights and benefits. Where the government decides to confer such benefits to advance social policy, it is entitled to determine who gets to receive those benefits.
1.18.4.1. Con: The government \(U.S.\) is a representative for the people. Polygenous inclined people should be included.
1.18.4.1.1. Con: Polygamous people are represented in any country. That doesn't mean governments have to change their binding relationship contracts. There's polygamous married couples in the US, it's just 2 people married who then bring in more into the relationship, who don't enjoy that legal status.
1.18.4.1.2. Con: There are a massive amount of minorities and opinions that representing all of them would lead to conflictions. For example, even though a minority of people believe in Nazism, it doesn't mean the government should be changed to suit the needs of these Nazis purely because they are a group that exist.
1.18.5. Con: The legal recognition of polygamous marriage has nothing to do with the "internal affairs" of consenting adults. People in polygamous relationships are free to behave however they wish in their homes and to hold themselves out as "married."
1.18.5.1. Con: A person can consider themselves married, or anything really. It doesn't make it so.
1.18.6. Pro: Laws against polygamy exist to push a specific religion on moral standard or to discourage the use of legal loopholes that only exist in places that still view males as sole bread winners \(like tax deductions given to married couples in a time when women didn't work\).
1.19. Pro: -> See 1.18.2.
