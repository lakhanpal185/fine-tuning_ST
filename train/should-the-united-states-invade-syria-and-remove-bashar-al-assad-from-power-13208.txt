Discussion Title: Should the United States Invade Syria and Remove Bashar al-Assad from Power?

1. The United States should invade Syria and remove Bashar al-Assad from power.
1.1. Con: Assad is a democratically elected head of state.
1.1.1. Con: When your father was the "elected" leader before you and grooms you for the job, you were not elected, it's "selected".  If it seems like any other candidates were not present to oppose you, the 'democracy' part also seems suspect.
1.1.2. Pro: Assad is a Western-friendly secular ruler, who is supported by the [majority of his people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_presidential_election,_2014).
1.1.2.1. Con: Elections in Syria are [not free](http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9\]) and manipulated. There is [no democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index) in Syria.
1.1.3. Con: The country of Syria is classified as an Authoritarian Regime, therefore eliminating the idea that he was democratically elected. [Attributes of Assad's Regime](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0429/Syria-101-4-attributes-of-Assad-s-authoritarian-regime/What-type-of-government-does-Syria-have)
1.1.3.1. Pro: The only country in the world classified as less democratic than Syria is North Korea. [Democracy Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index)
1.1.3.2. Con: The classification given to the Syrian government by Western governments who are its enemies is meaningless. It's historical fact that Assad was democratically elected and it's observably true that he remains hugely popular with most Syrians.
1.2. Pro: Chemical weapon attacks violate the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997, which Syria has ratified.
1.2.1. Con: After the first alleged chemical attack, Syria accepted to destroy every chemical weapon under OPCW observation. [OPCW](https://www.opcw.org/news/article/destruction-of-syrian-chemical-weapons-completed/) [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Syria%27s_chemical_weapons)
1.2.1.1. Con: Since their supposed destruction, chemical weapons attacks have continued. Many of these have been attributed to the Assad Regime by the [OPCW and UN](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Timeline-of-Syrian-Chemical-Weapons-Activity).
1.2.2. Con: The normal steps needed to be taken in order to prove a violation has occurred have not be taken.
1.2.2.1. Con: The missile response attacks taken by the US and its allies were affirmed to have decapacitated Syriaâ€™s chemical weapons availabilities thus demonstrating that the Assad regime had the means to commit the chemical attacks.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Whether or not Assad has the capacity to make chemical weapons was not in question; they disclosed that information in 2013 when they joined the Chemical Weapons Convention of the UN. Him possessing the means to produce them is not even close to enough evidence to justify certain blame for the attack.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: The continuation of a Chemical Weapons Program in modern day history, only furthers the idea that they are being created with intent to harm \(you are not going to create chemical weapons unless you intend to use them\). Further, Russian and Syrian authorities have barred outside investigators from finding out more about the attacks. [\(Source\)](https://www.timesofisrael.com/chemical-weapons-team-in-syria-kept-from-alleged-attack-site/)
1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Syrian and Russian authorities invited inspectors to come to the alleged chemical attack site the day after it was alleged to have happened. The doctor in charge of the hospital ward that treated the victims of the alleged chemical attack says the patients were not suffering from chemical attack injuries, he says "there was no chemical attack". 

Russia has only vetoed the US bid for an inquiry that would have taken place months from now,. USA has also vetoed Russia's bid for an inquiry.[rte.ie](https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2018/0410/953409-syria/)
1.2.2.1.3. Con: Confirmed by who? According to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons the place FUKUS bombed was not a chemical weapons facility. [anotherangryvoice.blogspot.co.uk](https://anotherangryvoice.blogspot.co.uk/2018/04/theresa-may-has-sidelined-and.html)

No chemical weapons have ever been found in the possession of Assad's SAA, while stockpiles of chlorine gas have been found in "rebel" hands.
1.2.3. Con: A violation of an international law, however bad it is, does not legitimate the violation of other international laws by itself.
1.2.4. Con: At present there is no verifiable evidence that Assad and the Syrian government have ever used chemical weapons against civilians.
1.2.4.1. Pro: It seems like every time a chemical attack has happened the Syrian army had already won by conventional means.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: The SAA have been winning in Syria, thanks to Russian help, for quite some time. Saudi backed ISIS have been all but eradicated and American backed al-Nusra terrorists have been surrendering in droves and leaving Damascus and surrounding cities with their families \(after negotiating with SAA by taking hostages\). Chemical weapons have been found in "rebel" hands. [dissidentvoice.org](https://dissidentvoice.org/2015/10/deconstructing-the-nato-narrative-on-syria/)
1.2.4.2. Pro: The perpetrator of the gas attack has not been confirmed, which gives no justification for the invasion of sovereign country.
1.2.4.3. Con: We do not need a justification of a gas attack to invade a country.  We have done it using other less substantiated reasonings.
1.2.4.3.1. Con: Just because the US has done it before, doesn't mean that they should do it again.
1.2.4.3.2. Con: Just because the US has done this before doesn't mean that it was justified in those other instances.
1.2.4.4. Pro: It makes no strategic sense for the Assad regime, while it has the upper hand in the civil war, to launch a chemical attack against the rebels, knowing full well that doing so would draw scrutiny - and perhaps retaliation - from the international community.
1.2.4.5. Con: The USA decided that it has a right to judge any other country and invade wherever it wants to. American government doesn't need any proof to justify its behavior, and simply does what it wants due to its fictional exclusivity.
1.2.4.6. Pro: One of the children in the chemical attack video [has testified that it was staged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfi8Zff8h2g).
1.3. Pro: If the regime is behind the attack, there must be police action by the international community to deter violent dictators from mass-murdering their own civilians.
1.3.1. Con: Perhaps, but there isn't such a definitive rule now; this was the same argument used for intervention in Libya, which turned out to be completely false, and the intervention has been a disaster for that country.
1.3.2. Pro: Invading Syria would see an end to one of the most brutish, corrupt and uncaring dictators in the Middle East.
1.3.2.1. Con: Assad is surely brutish and corrupt. But, like we saw in Iraq and Libya, his end would mean a collapse of the state and an endless civil and sectarian war.
1.3.3. Con: "If" is a large part of the issue and any organization that has proved itself incompetent or deliberately deceitful in establishing fault in cases of war crimes should not be permitted to make the same mistake here.
1.3.4. Con: There should be no country that can have right to intervene in other country's political, social and economical life. It is pure military aggression. And all of them should be viewed in one and only way whether it's Hitler's or USA invasions. No matter what happens there, we have no right to judge them. It's their own affairs. It's their life. If we want to offer our help than we should do it only after analysing few referendum's results to understand if people want to accept that type of help.
1.3.4.1. Pro: If the international community must deter mass murdering, then should they intervene in the USA regarding their role in Iraq, with at least a million people dead.
1.3.4.2. Con: As the US is a global superpower, those in the international community have given the US the power to act as such. This is provided for by the UN that was approved after WWII allowing the US to take an active role in international affairs and exact punishment against those who violate international laws.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: "Those in the international community" is a misnomer. France, Germany, and the UK have shown support for U.S. intervention in Syria, but not Russia or Iran. The "international community" is not a monolithic entity, but rather a collection of the individual states that make it up, and it simply reflects the interests of those member states. The phrase "those in the international community" deliberately gives the impression that there is unanimity where none exists.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: "Global superpowers" should not have right to decide the fate of other countries without asking them what do they want.
1.4. Pro: Russia cannot be allowed to take belligerent actions unopposed, including proxy funding of a violent civil war.
1.4.1. Con: It is hypocritical to accuse Russia of acting aggressively by supporting proxy actors, when the US and many other countries have done the same in the Middle East for decades.
1.4.1.1. Con: Hypocritical or not, the US has the responsibility to stand up to its only legitimate foreign adversary and not look weak in the international community.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Russia also has the "responsibility to stand up to its only legitimate foreign adversary and not look weak in the international community".
1.4.2. Con: The claim is flawed since it is the exactly the opposite to what happened. The US was in the Middle East for decades already, and during its presence there the ISIS was formed and created a huge wave of immigration to Europe, prior to any Russian action.
1.4.3. Pro: Russia has [consistently obstructed](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Timeline-of-Syrian-Chemical-Weapons-Activity) investigations into Chemical weapon attacks in Syria, refuted independent organisations and reports that the helped set up and vetoed any further investigations.
1.4.3.1. Con: Russia mediated the destruction of the Syrian chemical weapons stockpile with the observers from OPCW confirming it. June 23, 2014: OPCW Director General Uzumcu announced that the last 8 percent of Syria's chemical weapons was shipped out of the country from the port of Latakia on the Danish ship Ark Futura. Uzumcu says the chemicals should be destroyed within four months. [opcw.org](https://www.opcw.org/news/article/destruction-of-syrian-chemical-weapons-completed/) [armscontrol.org](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Timeline-of-Syrian-Chemical-Weapons-Activity)
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Since their supposed destruction there have been additional chemical weapon attacks, as well as at least [2 undeclared site/stockpiles found.](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Timeline-of-Syrian-Chemical-Weapons-Activity) Additional investigations by the OPCW have pinned the blame for these attacks on Syrian Loyalist forces or ISIS, depending on what chemical was used.
1.5. Con: Even if the United States removes Assad from power, there is no set course of action for installing a stable regime.
1.5.1. Pro: Moving to a stable democracy is a long process. Hasting it can generate a lot of frustrations and internal troubles that might lead to a civil war. A recent exemple of failed intervention is France with Lybia, they went on a crusade for freedom, ended up not having a trial for Qaddafi and having political and ethnic conflicts all around the country that have led to a reign of terror.
1.5.2. Con: The current Assad government is not going to be stable, because it relies on the threat of violence to maintain its power. It has also come to rely upon Russian and Iranian support, countries whose presence in Syria further destabilizes the Middle East.
1.5.2.1. Con: The Assad government, with the help of Russia and Iran, is the only stabilizing force in Syria, and Syrians are celebrating the return of the SAA after years of oppression under terrorist rule when groups like ISIS and US allies Al-Nusra Front were beheading children and forcing them to live under sharia law.[ingaza.wordpress.com](https://ingaza.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/a-personal-reply-to-the-fact-challenged-smears-of-terrorist-whitewashing-channel-4-snopes-and-la-presse/) 

[mintpressnews.com](https://www.mintpressnews.com/syria-war-diary-what-life-is-like-under-moderate-rebel-rule/231201/)
1.5.3. Pro: The resulting power vacuum will simply create room for new radical factions to spawn, such as with the Taliban, Al Qaeda, the Islamic State, or Hamas.
1.5.4. Pro: The aftermath of every U.S. intervention to crack down dictatorial regimes has been utter chaos, the most obvious examples being Iraq and Libya.
1.5.4.1. Pro: In Libya, Qaddafi was removed forcibly from power. Now the country is in ruins, with violent groups fighting each other for power.
1.5.5. Pro: It has never been the goal of the US government to protect civilians in the Middle East. This makes it very unlikely that such an intervention would result in a situation that's better for the Syrian people.
1.5.6. Pro: Having an occupying force would be the only way to stop the rising death toll and that is assuming that is indeed what we want to do. The choice we have is a reduced death toll with Assad in charge or a massively reduced death toll with American troops stationed for an indeterminate length of time. [Nearly 500,000 thousand souls have been taken in this conflict](https://www.globalresearch.ca/u-s-plan-b-for-the-middle-east-the-occupation-of-one-third-of-syrias-territory/5627819) a figure that may be larger because we have taken action to make sure this conflict is drawn out as long as possible.
1.6. Pro: Under the current AUMF \(passed in 2001 after 9/11\) the US has the legal obligation to take any and all actions against any possible current or future terrorist threat. As Assad maintains relations with terrorist entities in the region this would be covered under the document and further the War Powers Resolution reaffirmed by the AUMF.[Authorization for Use of Military Force](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/pdf/PLAW-107publ40.pdf)
1.6.1. Con: The UNSC should decide this in keeping with International Law. They would make their decision based on evidence. This is a great mechanism thanks to the initiative of FDR.
1.6.2. Con: When the AUME says "any and all actions" does that also include funding, encouraging, tasking etc terrorist groups within other countries \(ie contrary to the ICJ Nicaragua decision\). Even if we call such terrorist "rebels", such actions on our part may be incoherent, as well as immoral, and illegal under international law, \(which we may argue does not apply to the world's most powerful countries\).
1.6.2.1. Pro: There is also a worry that we are in Syria under false pretexts.
1.6.3. Con: By this justification, one gains the right to invade any sovereign nation in the world, as long as one deems any organization that country associates with to be a "terrorists," a label whose fluidity we are all aware of. Just because the President has the power to do something, does not mean it is in America's best interest for him to do it.
1.6.3.1. Con: The President is held accountable to both the people as well as congress, and in such instances that he ties a unconnected country to a terrorist organization, and then attacks that country using the AUMF as justification, his actions can be revoked and denied, and his public opinion could plummet. Further, the President would be acting on the military advice given to him by the top US officials that would strive to make the best decision for the American people.
1.6.4. Con: Assad does not "maintain relations with terrorist entities", that is just counterfactual nonsense. Assad maintains relationships with Russia, Iran and has been fighting terrorists like ISIS and Al-Nusra Front who the Americans are supporting. [mintpressnews.com](https://www.mintpressnews.com/un-feigns-outrage-over-ghouta-while-terrorist-rockets-rain-down-on-damascus/238148/)
1.6.5. Pro: If the US does nothing as Bashar Al-Assad uses banned weapons, engages in human rights abuses, and undermine American interests, then other countries will conclude that the US is not serious and can be easily ignored.
1.6.5.1. Con: This statement is meaningless unless you can provide evidence that Assad is doing any of these things.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: Till this day, it is the "alleged use" of chemical weapons. The opposition had the chemical weapons and a motive to use them to create a public outcry during the successful SAA offensive.
1.6.5.1.1.1. Con: Several independent [OPCW](https://www.opcw.org/special-sections/syria-and-the-opcw/) and [UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_chemical_weapons_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War) investigations have [found](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Timeline-of-Syrian-Chemical-Weapons-Activity) and concluded that [Assad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPCW-UN_Joint_Investigative_Mechanism), or at least Syrian Loyalist forces have used chemical weapons.
1.6.5.1.1.1.1. Con: All these instances are disputed. The Syrian government accepted to [destroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_Syria%27s_chemical_weapons) immediately the stockpile of chemical weapons under the OPCW. Leading to the conclusion that the chemical attacks were just a provocations.
1.6.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.
1.7. Con: The United States should not engage in another foreign war which costs American lives and hundreds of billions of tax dollars, while not making Americans any safer.
1.7.1. Con: Permitting the Assad government to operate as usual also endangers Americans. He [deliberately released](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/former-prisoners-fight-in-syrian-insurgency-a-927158.html) known terrorists from prison, knowing that those people would engage in violence, in order to discredit those opposed to his rule.
1.7.1.1. Con: The reason there are jihadists in the "rebel" army is because the "rebel" army are primarily wahabist Islamic extremists. jihadism in the "rebel" army is the norm, not the exception. America is the one funding terrorism. [globalresearch.ca](https://www.globalresearch.ca/how-the-mainstream-media-whitewashed-al-qaeda-and-the-white-helmets-in-syria/5624930)
1.8. Con: A direct clash between American and Russian troops in Syria has geopolitical implications of World War proportions.
1.8.1. Pro: US should fight Syria if and only if Syria threatens the sovereignty of US. US should not be allowed to act as global police.
1.8.1.1. Con: The United States has an inherent duty to carry out international law and act as a rightful global superpower.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Nothing about the "duty to act as a superpower" is inherent or rightful, considering that the ideas of "global superpower," or supranationalism, are extremely new \(post-1918, 1945\). Furthermore, the international laws that this role is based on are almost wholly determined by the handful of countries whose influence governs the vast majority of U.N. actions, so they are not unquestionably just, or unbiased. The UNSC cannot simply pass laws giving itself the right to invade sovereign nations.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Global superpowers have been in place in the world since the Roman Empire. The role of a global superpower has warped throughout time, but since industrialism, that single global power has been given the influence to uphold international law \(this wasnâ€™t always the US\). Further, the UN security counsel is comprised of the winning nations of WWII, and they ratify any decision made. Thus the UN canâ€™t just go around and pass laws whenever it wants and it is designed to uphold world interests.[UNSC](http://www.un.org/en/sc/)
1.8.2. Con: There is no evidence that a direct clash between US and Russian troops is likely. The more likely outcome of US invasion would be Russia controlling a Proxy war as it has done throughout time in Afghanistan, Vietnam, and Korea.
1.8.3. Pro: USA and the Coalition should not do anything before they ask the Syrians themselves; otherwise, it appears to be an action of a global dictatorship regime.
1.8.3.1. Con: While it would be nice to have some way of gauging the Syrian people's opinions, unfortunately this would be next to impossible. 1. Assad will not be letting the UN administer a referendum to his people asking if they want him overthrown. 2. Even if he was coerced to allow it, the people who participated would most likely be retaliated against. 3. Even if this happened, those countries who support Assad would accuse the UN of fabricating results to justify war, similar to Iraq.
1.9. Con: It's not America's responsibility nor right to decide or influence on internal affairs of any third party country, including Syria.
1.9.1. Pro: The US has no legal means to have a military presence which is occupying the whole of eastern Syria.
1.9.2. Pro: While Assad poses a humanitarian threat, the US is not in Syria for humanitarian reasons, they have their own selfish interests for being there. One example is that the US and Saudi Arabia want to manipulate oil prices [globalresearch.ca](https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-secret-stupid-saudi-us-deal-on-syria/5410130)
