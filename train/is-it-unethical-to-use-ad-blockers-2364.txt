Discussion Title: Is it unethical to use ad-blockers?

1. It is unethical to use ad-blockers.
1.1. Pro: Ads help ensure equity in access to internet services because the prevalence of advertising as a business practice means most Internet content is free.
1.1.1. Con: It is not the end user's responsibility to make sure that the internet is a free and accessible space. That is the internet service provider's and the government's job.
1.1.1.1. Con: There is no feasible government regulation that can stop websites imposing fees or other barriers. If the government banned such fees, those online services would just go out of business.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Consumers pay a fair price because ISP's already charge for internet services through dial up connections and data packs.
1.1.1.3. Con: While it is not an end user's responsibility, their behavior does influence the behavior of businesses and publishers online and could affect availability of content, e.g. by making content less profitable and incentivizing more publications to add paywalls to their websites.
1.1.2. Con: Access to internet "services" is nearly always a cost to the consumer, regardless of content.  The presence of advertisements does not cause a refund of one's connectivity cost.
1.1.3. Con: The presence of advertisements in web content is an unsolicited contract that the consumer has not entered. Content Providers, if wishing a quid-pro-quo contract, should use a paywall \(membership\) for revenue.
1.1.4. Con: The cost of content sent to the browser is a burden often carried by the consumer. By filtering which content one accepts, a client is saving bandwidth, energy and money.
1.1.5. Con: Other business practices, for example subscription models, are no less equitable than the use of ads. Everybody pays the same, after all.
1.1.5.1. Pro: In order to take into account that potential users differ in their financial resources, many subscription models offer discounts, for example for students.
1.1.5.2. Con: Making healthcare prohibitively expensive is not "equitable" merely because the same fees are charged to everyone. The point of equity is that basic services should be accessible to everyone, regardless of those people's incomes. News media and similar internet services are among those basic goods.
1.1.6. Pro: Ads create value by extracting personal data and interest from consumers. All consumers have an "equal" amount of these things to give websites, as opposed to other commodities like money.
1.1.6.1. Con: The user does not always consent to giving away this information.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: The vast majority of internet users consent to engaging with platforms like Facebook and Amazon, which are far more intrusive with their data collection. This indicates that most users do not care very much about this type of privacy.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Even when users have ad-blocking extensions enabled, they will receive email notifications from companies such as Amazon relating to potential purchases based on user history.
1.1.6.1.1.2. Con: Platforms like Facebook and Amazon offer an exchange value for the provision of data and give at least the impression of transparency and security. This makes it easier to agree to this kind of data collection than to the intransparent, covert and valueless ways in which advertisements collect data.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: If private data does have value then collecting it without consent or compensation is theft, by definition.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: If private data had no value then there would be no reason to collect it in the first place.
1.1.6.2. Con: There may be nothing particularly embarrassing or personal about the vulnerabilities of a consumer, but they might not especially want to share them with companies so that they can be exploited for financial gain.
1.1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.2.
1.1.6.4. Pro: Private data from consumers make algorithms deployed by providers such as Netflix, Hulu or YouTube [stronger and more reliable](http://business.financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/data-is-mothers-milk-to-netflix-as-it-tweaks-algorithms-to-find-that-perfect-content-just-like-a-dating-app). As such, they have a high value to online content providers.
1.1.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.2.
1.1.6.4.2. Pro: [Netflix](http://business.financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/data-is-mothers-milk-to-netflix-as-it-tweaks-algorithms-to-find-that-perfect-content-just-like-a-dating-app) needs data to survive since it depends on data in order to get more people to watch their programming. Netflix needs to analyse data for the most appropriate shows or movies for each of its 93 million subscribers to stay ahead on the market.
1.1.6.5. Con: Not all user attention is equally valuable; consumers with more disposable income or interests that are more easily monestised are higher value ad targets. This is inequitable as it means sites and services that cater to the wealthy can gain more ad revenue per person.
1.1.7. Pro: The prevalence of adblockers will eventually undermine the ability of internet services to remain free.
1.1.7.1. Con: There is no such thing as a free internet service. Even if content is free to view, there is a hidden cost to the viewer.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: This argument is begging the question. It circulates the original idea that was already present in the parent claim and uses it as a con to it. The parent claim used the word "free" to imply that free is what we get for giving something in return and we cannot give it if we use ad-blockers. It does not refute the original idea. In fact, it supports it.
1.1.7.1.2. Pro: On social media websites, service might be free, but the content creators profit from tracking and selling users' data and browsing history.
1.1.7.1.2.1. Pro: [Advertisers](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21662543-people-spend-more-time-social-media-advertisers-are-following-them-brand-new-game) like social-media platforms because those websites gather all sorts of data about users, and so ads can accurately target users.
1.1.7.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.1.7.1.4. Pro: [Ghostery](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/heres-how-that-adblocker-youre-using-makes-money/), an ad blocker for mobile phones, is free but the company makes money by collecting anonymous data.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Ads on the internet are the reason why a lot of content is free. Many popular news and social media sites rely on the ad funded business model as a source of revenue.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: That's materially wrong. First, this can be simply proven by the fact that internet was for a long time mostly free without ad business models. Second, today some of the best content is freely produced by individuals. The ad funded model is the first attempt to monetize content, it most likely is not the optimal way.
1.1.7.2.2. Pro: Advertising [contributed](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/how-important-advertising-revenue-internet-sector.asp) 90% of Google's total revenue, 79% of Yahoo's total revenue and 99% of Baidu's total revenue. Digital advertising accounted for 92% and 90% of Facebook's and Twitter's total revenues, respectively. This revenue is used to ensure their services are provided for free.
1.1.7.2.2.1. Con: Most of today's large platforms can only live because of creator's contributions, however, those creators aren't provided with a stable and transparent income and have to rely on highly fluctuating ad revenue. This is not fair to contributors who make those services what they are.
1.1.7.2.3. Pro: Online publishers [rely heavily](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/business/media-websites-battle-falteringad-revenue-and-traffic.html) on revenue from advertisements, without which they face serious budget cuts and reductions in staff size.
1.1.7.2.3.1. Con: This reliance on ad revenue also encourages clickbait-y headlines and a high update frequency, which generally results in lower quality content. In the long run, this is going to hurt their business more, because users will start looking for better content.
1.1.7.3. Con: Alternative strategies, like charging premiums, incentivise high-quality content.
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: When websites charge premiums, users shop around to decide which sites to pay for access to \(for example, choosing between Spotify Premium and Apple Music, or Netflix and Hulu\). This generates a competitive incentive to generate high-quality content.
1.1.7.3.2. Con: Companies have an incentive to design the sort of content that will encourage people to pay past a paywall in order to read the rest of the content. This content is likely to be clickbait-like in nature.
1.1.7.3.3. Pro: Once you have paid for a premium, a site knows that they have your attention. This allows them to design more substantive content which, while less superficially appealing at first glance, is more likely to draw you in to repaying the premium in the long term.
1.1.7.3.3.1. Pro: When websites run purely on ad revenue, their incentive is to create content that maximises clicks, not content that is of the highest quality.
1.1.7.4. Con: The word "free" contains an ambiguity between freedom and cost. In most cases, freedom is sold by an unwitting buyer to a conniving seller. The seller usually understands this and rarely has an interest in explaining it to the buyer. Therefore most advertising leads to sales that are done with a form of coerced consent and therefore most advertising is unethical.
1.1.8. Pro: A free and open internet is important for the global economy.
1.1.8.1. Pro: The International Trade Commission estimates that [digital trade has increased U.S. GDP](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-importance-of-the-internet-and-transatlantic-data-flows-for-u-s-and-eu-trade-and-investment/) by 3.4 to 4.8% and has created up to 2.4 million jobs with increasing gains if countries reduce barriers to digital trade.
1.1.8.2. Pro: The internet creates opportunities for small businesses to participate in the global economy.
1.1.8.2.1. Pro: Small and medium sized businesses on eBay have a 54% [survival rate](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-importance-of-the-internet-and-transatlantic-data-flows-for-u-s-and-eu-trade-and-investment/) compared to offline businesses \(24%\).
1.1.8.2.1.1. Con: eBay's business model is not advertising: it is a marketplace. So eBay would not be harmed by the use of adblockers, and would continue to allow small businesses to thrive.
1.1.8.2.1.1.1. Pro: eBay [tried putting ads on their webpages](https://www.pcworld.com/article/138155/article.html) and it made the marketplace sellers really upset. eBay recognized people come to eBay to buy stuff from the sellers, and as such prioritized seller revenue over ad revenue. eBay tried ads, they were harmed, \(regardless of adblocking\) and they stopped.
1.1.8.2.2. Con: Small premiums on website access are unlikely to be substantial barriers to entry for small businesses.
1.1.8.2.2.1. Con: Other methods of extracting value from web visitors, like charging them directly, mean that socioeconomically disadvantaged people are left less able to access some internet services.
1.1.8.2.2.1.1. Con: There are few sites online blocked by a pay-barrier that cannot be circumvented or attained via alternative means -- whether those means be legal or not.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2. Con: This argument is a fallacy based on the idea that there are only two possible business models i.e. ads or paywalls. We're only at the beginning of the internet, and the beginning of thinking about these things. As long as there is fallacy-based resistance to innovation, we will not have room for new ideas to come in and take over. Ideas that put the content producers and internet users back in the center. Now the center is advertising technology companies who make most of the money.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Business practices always evolve with consumer trends. Web based companies have already developed some tools to combat ad block software.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Many mobile applications have introduced ad panels that cannot be blocked as long as you are using the app. These are located either on the top or the bottom of the app screen. The app cannot be used unless the ad is visible. \(Examples: [Angry Birds](http://www.adageindia.in/digital/angry-birds-publisher-rovio-slingshots-itself-into-the-ad-business/articleshow/45872394.cms), [Quiz Up](https://www.mobilemarketer.com/ex/mobilemarketer/cms/news/content/17829.html).\)
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Some websites have made content inaccessible unless ad block is disabled. Users are prompted to disable ad block when the page loads. Failure to comply doesn't render the content to the screen \(e.g. Forbes\).
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.3. Con: One cannot justify shooting a person in the chest and killing them by saying "Well they should have had a bullet-proof vest!" Consequently, one cannot justify any harm caused by running an ad-blocker by saying "well you should have had tools to combat ad-blockers!"
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.3.1. Con: One can justify BlockBuster [going out of business](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-netflix-bankrupted-and-destroyed-blockbuster-infographic-2011-3) by saying "well, they should have adapted to changing market conditions!" Consequently, one can justify any harm caused by running an ad-blocker by saying "well, you should have understood your target demographic better and adapted to changing market conditions!"
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: This is a false equivalence. Running an ad blocker is an active measure to prevent a company from showing you something, while still consuming their product. Not shopping at BlockBuster is choosing an entirely different business to shop at.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4. Pro: Many popular media sources offer premium subscription services that are ad-free.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Premium subscriptions only grant access to a limited number of media sources. This leaves users with the option of paying for additional subscriptions, viewing content with ads, or limiting their access to online media.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Ad blockers are a much cheaper alternative than paying for a subscription and looking at other options.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The fact that they are cheaper does not make them ethical or legal. On the contrary, it is unethical to put the costs above the mutual rights of both parties to profit from information exchange.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.1.2. Con: Limitation of media sources is not a valid argument against premium subscriptions. Paying for a newspaper also limits person's ability to buy other newspapers if he/she does not have enough financial resources to accommodate the unlimited amount of newspapers. This does not make ad-blocking ethical.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.1.3. Con: The argument proposes that the consumer has several options to choose from. Offering options cannot be seen as a limitation, but an opposite, an extension.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Subscriptions like the one offered by [YouTube Red](https://www.youtube.com/red) allows users to access normally ad-dependent media content ad-free.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.1.1.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.4. Pro: Newspaper and magazine companies like the [New York Times](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-times-readies-ad-free-digital-subscription-model-1466438381) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/10/ads-in-the-atlantic/504218/) offer subscriptions to avoid ads and discourage the use of ad-blockers.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.5. Pro: [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/) and [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/) allow users to access customized radio content without ads.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.6. Pro: Supporting a publisher on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com) is an increasingly popular business model. The \(typically\) low levels of financial support it gathers through micro-transactions nevertheless make it possible to support creative work.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.6.1. Pro: Patreon and other similar services allow content creators to tailor their work to niche demographics, thereby capitalizing on the apparent demand for highly specialized ad-free content.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.5. Pro: Publishers and online content creators are seeking to find a middle-ground, where they recognize advertisements are annoying, the website can still get revenue, and users can run ad-blockers.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: As part of an initiative to combat ad-block and improve the overall quality of advertisements, [Google](https://www.ft.com/content/71d92114-4704-11e7-8519-9f94ee97d996) is launching "funding choices," where publishers can ask for micropayments from readers with ad-block. Readers can either pay to view content ad-free, or disable their ad-block and view the content for free with ads.
1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.5.2. Pro: Visitors to the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us) who are running ad-block see the message: "We notice that you’ve got an ad-blocker switched on. Perhaps you’d like to support the Guardian another way?”
1.1.8.2.2.1.3. Pro: Even small fees can impose a significant barrier to entry for many demographic groups.
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: A lot of internet using households are skeptical of undertaking online financial transactions and want to minimize the number they engage in. [\(Munro, 2016\)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2016/05/15/new-survey-highlights-startling-erosion-of-online-trust/#6413286e6eb0)
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.2. Con: If micro-fees become more widespread as advertising declines, there will be demand for ways to pay them quickly and efficiently, which will increase accessibility.
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.3. Pro: Requiring online transactions shuts out poorer people, many of whom [lack bank accounts.](http://business.time.com/2012/11/20/why-so-many-americans-dont-have-bank-accounts/)
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.3.1. Con: As the world moves increasingly away from cash and towards digital currency, bank accounts and internet-payment services will become cheaper and more accessible.
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.4. Con: Fees, like all prices, are likely to scale depending on the country in which they are being demanded.
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.4.1. Con: While transaction fees may be small for high-income countries which might compose the majority of traffic for a given site, the real value of the fees might be much higher for people in poorer countries.
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.4.1.1. Con: Fees can be changed or scaled to adjust to a country's economic situation.
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: Internet companies are actively incentivised to do so, since lowering fees in poorer countries raises demand in those countries, and could thus increase revenues.
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.5. Pro: The presence of small fees could prevent younger children, who might not be able to access a payment method, from freely navigating the internet.
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.5.1. Con: Having roadblocks to children freely roaming the internet is not a bad thing, as there is much content online that is not suitable for them.
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.5.1.1. Pro: There are good reasons for parents to want to supervise their children's access to the sorts of websites that are likely to institute fees - for example, news sites, or video streaming sites.
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.6. Con: Internet access is a vital necessity nowadays; something many governments have already realized. The state could therefore add coverage of basic internet fees to their social security and welfare programs.
1.1.8.2.2.1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.2.2.1.3.4.1.
1.1.8.2.2.1.4. Con: There are already successful ideas that don't impose high fees on users in the form of "pay what you want" or "freemium" models.
1.1.8.2.2.1.5. Con: The use of ad-blockers to block unsolicited ads does not prevent users from supporting a service by means of viewing ads voluntarily.
1.1.8.3. Con: Advertisements necessarily pollute a free and open internet as they impose costs on accessing content.
1.1.8.3.1. Pro: Advertisements consume [bandwidth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bandwidth-2625809), which is the volume of information per unit of time that a transmission medium \(like an internet connection\) can handle.
1.1.8.3.1.1. Pro: [Autoplay video](https://techtalk.gfi.com/does-your-bandwidth-belong-to-autoplay-videos-and-ads/) advertisements leech bandwidth. Bandwidth is a fixed amount based on what one pays for, and thus users are paying to view ads.
1.1.8.3.1.1.1. Pro: Video ads can [leech bandwidth](http://techaeris.com/2016/06/14/vpaid-ads-hurting-internet-experience/) by the 10s of megabytes.
1.1.8.3.1.2. Con: Almost all ads are so small that their bandwidth is unlikely to saturate a user's connection or significantly contribute to their data caps.
1.1.8.3.1.2.1. Con: There are actually pages that are much bigger with ads. There are so many of then than the size of a page [can go from 500 Kb to some MBs](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm#fatads).
1.1.8.3.2. Pro: Ads are distracting and waste users' time.
1.1.8.3.2.1. Con: Advertisement is meant to attract users' attention. Arguing against this very point of ads is the same as rejecting ads in general, which is unrealistic.
1.1.8.3.2.2. Pro: The U.S. internet audience viewed a whopping [4.6 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/17/comscore-the-average-youtube-viewer-watches-5-hours-of-videos-a-month/) video ads in May 2011. Time spent watching videos ads totaled more than 2 billion minutes during the month of May 2011, and since the ad market has grown considerably since 2011, it follows that the amount of time wasted has only increased since then.
1.1.8.3.2.3. Pro: In 2011, Video ads accounted for [12.6%](https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/17/comscore-the-average-youtube-viewer-watches-5-hours-of-videos-a-month/) of all videos viewed and 1.2% of all minutes spent viewing video online, a huge amount of time on aggregate.
1.1.8.3.2.4. Con: For those who look to generate income through the creation of material on the internet advertising can often be their main source of income. Some fantastic videos, articles and sources of information are there because advertising allows creatives the income to continue their craft. If the revenue from the advert is the reason that the creator actually publishes these videos in the first place it cannot be a waste of time.
1.1.8.3.2.5. Pro: Some sites abuse those who don't use adblock. A perfect example is Crunchyroll, which forces you to watch three ads in a row before being allowed to watch the desired video, and again during random intervals throughout said video.
1.1.9. Pro: Since many internet services that are ad-supported have social and cultural value, undermining them would be against the public interest.
1.1.9.1. Pro: Social networking sites are often ad-supported and give a large number of benefits to users.
1.1.9.1.1. Pro: Facebook makes a huge portion of its revenues through advertising and selling user data.
1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: [Facebook](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/facebook/550376/?utm_source=atlfb) have just [announced](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/) that they are going to reduce advertising and news content on the news feed, which could in turn greatly affect digital advertising \(and journalism\).
1.1.9.2. Pro: There are online ad-supported support groups for individuals in need of some sort of care.
1.1.9.3. Pro: A lot of NGOs have an ad-supported online presence.
1.1.9.3.1. Pro: [Opensocial](https://www.getopensocial.com/pricing?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyszSBRDJARIsAHAqQ4r-s2uZzrPvZwGf_klcbBXfGPoS4tVTcsuoKzZ2H8VsXyc5d-NCZasaAsVLEALw_wcB) and [Osocio](http://osocio.org/) are websites that help NGO clients improve their advertising presence online.
1.1.9.3.2. Pro: Companies like Google have programs like [Ad-Grants](https://www.google.com/intl/en/grants/) which allow NGOs to get advertising revenue without investing in the costs of marketing.
1.1.9.3.3. Pro: NGOs like [CRY](https://www.cry.org/) and [Smile Foundation](http://www.smilefoundationindia.org/) have an active online presence.
1.1.9.4. Pro: [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/#ba9f81b2254c) and [Time](http://time.com/) provide informative articles to readers and support their websites through advertising.
1.1.10. Con: Ads provide financial support to content providers, but do not support internet service providers. Viewing ads does not help increase access to the internet \(which can be used to do many things other than view ad-supported content\).
1.1.10.1. Con: The point is that ads support the content providers. If they couldn't rely on ad revenue and had to start charging users instead, then users would have to pay even more, besides their ISP. Therefore, the Internet is still made less accessible.
1.1.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.2.2.1.
1.1.12. Con: -> See 1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.
1.1.13. Con: The word free contains ambiguity about freedom vs cost. In the case of advertising, freedom is sold without consent: the buyer is rarely aware of the freedom she or he is giving up and it is not in the advertiser's interest to explain it.
1.1.13.1. Con: Ads don't impact your freedom. Unless advertisements slow down a service or cover content \(which can usually be reported\), they don't limit anything you do.
1.1.13.2. Pro: Ads are, in fact, scientifically proven to affect people on a cognitive level and do impact freedom of choice. They are modifying judgement through specific conditioning techniques based on cognitive psychology. This is a whole research field in media psychology. [academic.oup.com](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/16/3/269/1818788) [www.tandfonline.com](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00913367.1996.10673493) [www.jstor.org](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3149409) [www.jstor.org](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3151660)
1.2. Pro: Running ad-blockers is equivalent to freeloading off of media publications because it blocks their revenue stream.
1.2.1. Con: Users who install adblock software are unlikely to have clicked the adverts in any event, as clearly the user does not want to see the ads
1.2.2. Con: Ads are a business model. An efficient business model is based on the assumption that the audience will not change its behaviour, unless there is something to gain. Blaming ad-blockers as "unethical" has the potential to cover up the real reasons as to why ad-based businesses are not always successful.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Nobody is forcing media outlets to put their content on a open and global network. It is their responsibility to find a working business model.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Many websites are free yet still collect the majority of their revenue from non-ad sources: for example, Wikipedia.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Wikimedia is a Foundation, not a business. The analogy is invalid. It is supported by volunteers and has to request donations to survive. It is impossible for every major media business to shift to an NGO model, fire is employee base and survive on donations. The end user and thousands of employees are the first to suffer.
1.2.2.3. Con: Many internet businesses would still be successful without ads, by charging premiums instead. The point is that forcing them towards these tactics by freeloading is undesirable, since premiums restrict the access of many people to content.
1.2.2.3.1. Con: It is actually ethical to restrict the access of many people to content which carries ads. Because ads may get them to purchase things they probably don't need.
1.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Advertising is psychologically damaging. Given this, it is perfectly moral to take whatever steps are necessary  to minimise its impact.
1.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The "end justifies its means" logic is by default considered to be highly immoral and unethical.
1.2.2.3.1.1.2. Pro: Ads promote the consumption of unnecessary good and services. Consumerism is bad for the environment and does not increase happiness. Consumerism is thus not ethical.
1.2.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: Advertising has subversive effects and conditions consumers to link certain emotions with specific products. The result is a “I like it, but I don’t know why” effect that leads to purchases without much rational thought \([Dempsey/Mitchell, p. 614](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/653947)\).
1.2.2.3.1.1.4. Con: Not all advertisements should be lumped together: while there certainly are bad and harmful advertisements, there are also plenty of better-made examples.
1.2.2.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: Fitness advertisement that focuses on well-trained models can lead to negative perception of one's own body in consumers. These effects are much lower when ads instead focus on fitness products \([Sabiston/Chandler, p. 173](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-9861.2010.00047.x/abstract)\).
1.2.2.3.1.1.4.2. Pro: Plenty of evidence connects the use of thin, attractive models in advertisement to body-focused anxiety in consumers. As research shows, these effects can be minimized by using average-sized, attractive models - without reducing the effectiveness of advertisement \([Halliwell/Dittmar, p. 119f.](http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.23.1.104.26989)\).
1.2.2.3.1.1.4.3. Con: While there may be advertising that is not negative, the user doesn't often have the choice whether to be affected, and cannot reasonably opt in/out.
1.2.2.3.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Most people do not realize that they have a choice to "opt out" because the default is "opt in" and opting out often requires technical expertise. \(A "tyranny of the default".\)
1.2.2.3.1.1.4.4. Con: Companies are under immense competition and it rarely pays for them to take the effort to make ethical and consentual advertising.
1.2.2.3.1.1.5. Con: If users want to protect themselves from all negative effects of ads, they can use [ad-page-blockers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-ethical-ad-blocker/chpijkaobnoplgnjpjilbdcklmmpgfla?hl=en-US) that block all content sponsored by ads.
1.2.2.3.1.1.5.1. Con: Ad-page-blockers would not completely prevent the user from contracting malware as long as the user was still using the internet, and it would reduce web traffic on legitimate sites.
1.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Website creaters would not know the reasons behind the reductions in web traffic to their sites, and so could not take steps to remedy it and help their businesses.
1.2.2.3.1.1.5.2. Pro: An [unexpected benefit](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xywepq/the-creator-of-ethical-ad-blocker-is-trying-to-build-an-ethical-tech-business) of running the ethical ad-page-blocker is that it shows users just how ad-dependent their typical internet experience is. The program was specifically designed to show people just how much of the internet depends on ads by blocking almost all content on most websites as a result of their use of ads.
1.2.2.3.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: The [makers of the extension](https://feeltrain.com/blog/hello-feel-train/) claim that they are confronting users with their own humanity by putting them face to face with the inhuman. The ethical ad-page-blocker is evidence of this, as it significantly alters a user's access to the internet.
1.2.2.3.1.1.5.2.2. Con: It's not clear how this understanding will directly benefit the users of this extension.
1.2.2.3.1.1.5.2.2.1. Con: Clarity is a logical fallacy. Just because it is not clear does not make the argument less valid.
1.2.2.3.1.1.5.2.3. Con: Because the internet is so dependent on revenue from advertisements, running such a total ad block program would block most content, which undermines the point of using the internet in the first place.
1.2.2.3.1.1.5.3. Pro: This particular program is not a mere alternative to ad-blockers, like paying a subscription or opting to fill out a survey. Instead it is an alternative that specifically addresses the unethical aspects of ad-blocking.
1.2.2.3.1.1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.5.2.3.
1.2.2.3.1.1.5.5. Con: -> See 1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.
1.2.2.3.1.1.6. Pro: Parts of society \([elderly](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/globalassets/age-uk/documents/reports-and-publications/reports-and-briefings/safe-at-home/age_uk_briefing_fraud_and_scams_sept_2016.pdf), learning disability, children...\) are more [vulnerable](http://adage.com/article/digital/careful-targeting-vulnerable-groups-ftc/302030/) to clicking on targeted ads.
1.2.2.3.1.1.7. Con: Social awareness and pressure has caused advertisers to begin reforming their practices to eliminate harmful elements.
1.2.2.3.1.1.7.1. Pro: Fashion advertisers have begun using [plus-size models](https://www.buzzfeed.com/norawhelan/theres-more-than-one-plus-size-model?utm_term=.eorLakZlE#.bu1Ox24XE).
1.2.2.3.1.1.7.2. Pro: Fashion companies have begun using [trans models](http://www.ranker.com/list/famous-transgender-models/lgbt).
1.2.2.3.1.1.7.3. Pro: Fashion advertising has become increasingly [racially diverse](http://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/717823-diversity-report-spring-2017-runways/).
1.2.2.3.1.1.7.3.1. Con: Some forms of [multicultural](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/advertising-race-1970s-stereotypes-offensive/395624/) advertising merely reinforce stereotypes.
1.2.2.3.1.1.7.3.1.1. Pro: [Asian Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_stereotyping_in_advertising#cite_note-:8-12) are often represented as affluent, well educated individuals with a high work ethic, and tend to feature more often in advertising that promotes technology and business than African American or Latino models. Asian Americans were shown in the workplace in 50% of the print ads that they featured in, whilst African Americans and Latinos were more diversely featured in a variety of activities such as outdoor and sporting pursuits or at leisure.
1.2.2.3.1.1.7.3.1.2. Pro: In early 2018, H&M [apologized](https://nypost.com/2018/01/08/hm-apologizes-for-coolest-monkey-ad-featuring-black-child/) for offending customers by advertising a hoodie with the slogan "coolest monkey in the jungle" on a Black child, in a campaign with other hoodies \(labeled "tour guide" and "survival expert"\) that were modeled on white children.
1.2.2.3.1.1.7.3.1.3. Pro: In a [2017 Facebook ad](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/dove-ad-racist.html) for Dove body wash, a Black woman removed her dark shirt to reveal a white woman underneath, leading to criticism of the brand for seeming to imply the superiority of lighter skin.
1.2.2.3.1.1.7.4. Con: Even if fashion advertisers use different models, the ultimate goal is the same: to make people feel insecure about their appearance and cause them to buy fashion products.
1.2.2.3.1.1.8. Pro: Many internet ads try to take advantage of users' insecurities while they are vulnerable.
1.2.2.3.1.1.8.1. Pro: Pages dedicated to health issues are full of advertisements for 'diet pills' that try to [take advantage of users](http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=124290&page=1) by manipulating photos, quoting experts who aren't what they seem and forging scientific support.
1.2.2.3.1.1.8.2. Pro: Internet porn sites often have advertisements for untested and unregulated medications that supposedly enhance sexual performance.
1.2.2.3.1.1.9. Pro: Internet advertisements often aim to sell products that have not been tested or approved by government regulating agencies.
1.2.2.3.1.1.9.1. Pro: As per [FDA regulation](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/complementary-and-alternative-medicine/dietary-supplements/fda-regulations.html), dietary supplements are considered safe until proven unsafe. A lot of them are marketed via online advertising without being adequately tested.
1.2.2.3.1.1.9.2. Pro: Ads touting unproven herbal remedies for serious illnesses fill the airwaves of some immigrant communities in [Southern California](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/20/local/la-me-herbal-ads-20120815).
1.2.2.3.1.1.9.3. Con: Consumer protection laws apply equally to the online and physical domain. Customers can hold advertisers accountable for faulty or untested products.
1.2.2.3.1.1.9.3.1. Pro: In the United States, laws like the [CAN-SPAM Act of 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003) and [Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_Consumer_Protection_Act_of_1991) regulate products that can be advertised and the ways companies can advertise them on the internet.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10. Con: This is an argument against advertising in general, it is not specifically related to the use of ad blockers. The use of ad blockers may be unethical despite advertising being psychologically damaging.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.1. Con: If advertising subjects users to harms, then it is ethical for users to protect themselves from those harms by using adblockers.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.1.1. Pro: Online advertising is particularly detrimental to alcoholics and addicts, many of whom report seeing ads for their addictive product or paraphernalia after searching for resources to help fight addiction. Blocking online ads can be a small but significant way of helping their recovery.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.1.2. Pro: Ad bombardment can train the brain to tune out attention grabbing methods as white noise.  This can be dangerous when warnings get tuned out as well.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2. Pro: There are means of avoiding ads online that are ethical.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.5.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.2. Con: The existence of alternatives does not make the use of ad blockers themselves unethical.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.2.1. Con: If exposing yourself to ads is unethical or undesirable, but there are methods of avoiding ads that create fewer harms, this does make using an ad-blocker unethical because you are making a choice that maximises harmful impacts on others.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.2.1.1. Pro: When a publisher chooses to show an ad that the user does not want to see, the publisher is unethical because they are making a choice that maximizes harmful impact on others. One necessarily affects the other, and the most ethical thing to do is that which minimizes harmful impact. The least impactful thing cannot be banning users from using ad-blockers.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.3. Con: There are no options available that are as comprehensive as ad-blockers.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.3.1. Con: Many of the given alternatives can be used at the same time as ad-blockers.  It is fair to be morally required to use multiple options over one easier immoral one.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.1.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.3.3. Con: [Brave browser](https://brave.com/) offers an alternative that blocks ads and trackers but allows micropayments or cryptocurrency contributions to websites that the user visits most frequently.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.3.3.1. Con: While Brave boasts faster browsing than Chrome and Safari, it tends to lag when opening 5 or more tabs. This makes Brave a [less viable alternative](https://www.technochops.com/brave-browser-review-2017-heres-experienced-far/2681/) for many users.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.3.3.1.1. Con: The fact that Brave browser is a less viable alternative does not make ad-blocking ethical. This argument is unrelated to the ethics of ad-blockers.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.4. Pro: Users could disable Javascript and/or images in their browser. This would prevent that harms of ads while imposing a cost on the user themselves that offsets the damages to advertisers.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.4.1. Con: If you disable JavaScript, many websites [won’t work properly](https://www.howtogeek.com/138865/htg-explains-should-you-disable-javascript/). Disabling JavaScript may break the ability to log in, post comments, or dynamically request content on interactive websites.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.4.1.1. Pro: Streaming requires a JavaScript or Flash plugin to work. Disabling JavaScript on such websites would prevent them from working, defeating the purpose of going to those sites to begin with.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.4.2. Con: There is no difference, from an ethical point of view, between disabling javascript and running an ad-blocker. Both stop the showing of ads on web pages and thus both stop the revenue websites make from them.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.4.2.1. Con: An ad-blocker is specifically designed however for that purpose. Disabling javascript, like using a screen reader or a running a non-graphical browser, only blocks ads as a side effect to an otherwise useful technology.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.4.2.2. Con: By disabling javascript users miss out on other functionality present on a page. That users have to sacrifice something themselves in order to not view ads makes disabling javascript a more ethical choice.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.4.3. Con: Subjecting oneself to a higher cost benefits no one. It is like attempting to purchase a product by burning your own money rather than paying for it.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5. Pro: Users can always go to alternate publications that do not present ads or abstain from browsing altogether.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.1. Con: Users often desire content that is available exclusively on one service. Therefore they cannot access the same content through another channel.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.1.1. Con: If one would like to see the next Star Wars movie the day it comes out, but cannot afford or does not wish to pay the price the only theater in town showing it charges, it is still wrong to sneak in the back door.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.2. Pro: Many media sources, such as the BBC or PBS are publicly-funded and thus do not employ advertising.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.2.1. Con: Publicly funded, ad free alternatives are not available for most internet based services such as Netflix, YouTube, Amazon etc.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: Most content providers that have similar financial resources competing for the same share of the market use advertising as a revenue stream. Alternatives are not easily available.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: It is next to impossible to find news sites without advertisement, and especially so in countries that do not have publicly-funded services that do not rely on ad revenue.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.2.1.1.2. Con: A lack of alternatives that suit your preferences does not relieve you of your ethical responsibilities.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.2.1.2. Con: This merely supports the argument that there should be publicly funded and ad free alternatives to these media platforms.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.3. Con: Almost a third of all internet usage is spent on [social media](http://blog.globalwebindex.net/chart-of-the-day/social-media-captures-30-of-online-time/) and thus platforms that are both ad-supported and do not have viable alternatives due to network effects.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.3.1. Con: This does not make ad-blocking ethical.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.2.1.1.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.7. Pro: [Google Contributor](https://contributor.google.com/v/beta) \(beta\) allows users to purchase ad-free access to websites on a use-by-use basis.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.7.1. Con: [Google Contributor](https://contributor.google.com/v/beta) can only be used on two websites at this time. This limits the usefulness of this product.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.7.2. Con: [Daniel Aleksandersen](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/google-contributor-twopointoh) argues that a change in Google Contributor from 2016 to 2017 will result in a lack of users subscribing to many websites and experiencing any noticeable reduction in ads with the subscriptions they have.
1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.3.3.
1.2.2.3.1.1.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.10.1.
1.2.2.3.1.1.12. Pro: Advertising often makes use of harmful social narratives - like beauty standards - in order to pressure users to purchase products.
1.2.2.3.1.1.12.1. Con: Which ads are displayed on websites is controlled by the owner of the site. Ads that promote questionable attitudes and narratives can thus be filtered out.
1.2.2.3.1.1.12.1.1. Con: Such ads are harmful to the viewers, not to the website owners; and if these ads stimulate potential revenue, then it likely is not in the interest of the site to filter them.
1.2.2.3.1.1.12.1.2. Pro: Recently, businesses have been subjected to increasing public scrutiny and social pressure not to use unethical business tactics.
1.2.2.3.1.1.12.1.2.1. Pro: This scrutiny has extended to advertising, with ad companies being [pressured](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/breitbart-advertising-deals-companies-advertising-withdraw-pull-steve-bannon-alt-right-campaign-a7599156.html) into withdrawing ads from distasteful sites. The converse \(pressuring sites to withdraw distasteful ads\) could easily happen.
1.2.2.3.1.1.12.1.2.1.1. Pro: Backlash from consumers and television/internet audiences have already pushed companies to apologise for or withdraw distasteful advertisements.
1.2.2.3.1.1.12.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: In the UK in 2017, [McDonald's](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/16/mcdonalds-apologizes-for-distasteful-bereavement-advert.html) apologized after its advertising campaign attracted widespread criticism for exploiting childhood bereavement.
1.2.2.3.1.1.12.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: In 2012, [Belvedere Vodka](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/03/23/social-media-idiocy-of-the-day-belevedere-vodkas-rape-joke/#361ba9a61cd9) was forced to apologise for and take down a Facebook ad that was grossly sexist and inappropriate.
1.2.2.3.1.1.12.1.2.1.2. Con: It is dangerous to leave it to big businesses to decide which content is or is not moral for their users rather than letting users decide for themselves.
1.2.2.3.1.1.12.1.2.2. Con: Ads that play on stereotypes are so ubiquitous, and such an accepted feature of everyday life, that it would be hard to stir up sufficient public outrage to create meaningful pressure.
1.2.2.3.1.1.12.2. Pro: Advertising utilizes idealized images to which consumers compare the more modest reality as well as themselves. A result can be dissatisfaction with the self \([Richins, p. 81](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2489486?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\).
1.2.2.3.1.1.12.2.1. Pro: Research indicates that exposure to sexist advertisement can lead to dissatisfaction with one's body and its discrepancy from what is portrayed as ideal. Women see themselves as larger then they should be, men as smaller \([Lavine et al, p. 1056](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/01461672992511012)\).
1.2.2.4. Pro: There are many media businesses like Netflix that are very successful in the internet market place that have business models that do not rely on advertising revenue. [\(Radak, 2016\)](http://www.business2community.com/business-innovation/breaking-netflix-business-model-history-future-vod-giant-01582436#Pzw2pGDQQ7HYepsu.97)
1.2.2.4.1. Con: Many of these businesses struggle to make the ends meet. Netflix has a 1 billion negative cash flow. Spotify struggles to pay out music labels. YouTube largely survives on profit produced by other Google services. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/magazine/can-netflix-survive-in-the-new-world-it-created.html) [fortune.com](http://fortune.com/2016/05/24/spotify-financials/)
1.2.3. Con: If websites are struggling financially because of ad blockers, they can just force users to disable their ad blocker. So if ad blockers are available, it must be that they do not cause considerable harm to the website, and therefore using them is not "freeloading".
1.2.3.1. Con: It's a strawman argumentation. The existence of ad-blockers is not a proof that they do not cause harm.
1.2.3.2. Con: This imposes a higher cost on those who do pay for the goods/services. Since freeloading leads to an increase in prices, it means that the people who pay essentially end up subsidizing its use for those who do not pay, which is highly unfair.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: According to this logic, the prices of video games, music, movies and even newspaper subscriptions should have been increasing for years. Yet the opposite has been the case.
1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: Despite increasing production costs and the ubiquitous presence of piracy, for years AAA video games have consistently been sold for [$60](https://gamerant.com/video-game-prices-breakdown-514/).
1.2.3.2.2. Con: To the contrary, the ability to avoid fees puts pressure on companies to reduce prices for fear of driving more consumers towards pirating.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: If companies are forced to lower prices and therefore reduce their profits, this comes at the expense of their ability to innovate and create new content in the future, which is harmful to everyone.
1.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Though this might be true for high risk industries like pharmaceuticals or military research, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case with internet content.
1.2.3.3. Con: It is unethical to force already struggling internet companies to antagonize their customers in the hope of being competitive in the market.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: It is unethical for any internet company to try to "have their cake and eat it too", by allowing users their full rights that come with design of HTTP protocol, and then turning around and complaining about users exercising their rights. The right thing to do is to either block users using ad blockers, or allow for ad-blocking users without complaining.
1.2.3.4. Con: An action doesn't have to have a crippling effect on a business' viability in order for it to be unethical. Just because a company can bear the cost of theft doesn't make stealing from them justified.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Large publications like Forbes and Time prompt users to disable their ad blockers before allowing users to view articles and other content.
1.2.4. Pro: Without advertisements, many internet content creators would not get paid.
1.2.4.1. Pro: In many cases, publishers offer a subscription service that removes advertising from their pages. To gain the benefits of the service without paying is cheating.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Users can't be expected to subscribe to all website they visit, this would not make sense economically even for users who are willing to pay for content, there's simply too many websites out there.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: YouTube content creators make up to [20 times more money](https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/totalbiscuit-youtube-red-payout/) from subscribers on YouTube Red than they make from advertising revenue.
1.2.4.1.2.1. Con: In 2015, a [YouTube](http://www.adweek.com/digital/pewdiepie-on-youtube-red-adblock-has-actual-consequences/) star with 40 million subscribers conducted a poll which revealed only 7% of users intend to use YouTube Red.
1.2.4.2. Con: If ad-blocking reduces the number of digital impressions \(spaces for online ads\), in theory [the law of supply and demand](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp?lgl=dpmf-myfinance) says revenue for website creators could increase because advertising companies would pay more for an ad space. Because there would be higher demand for the ad spaces, the price would go up.
1.2.4.2.1. Con: The analogy is a composition logical fallacy. The law of supply and demand only applies to goods that are in demand by consumers of said goods. Consumers of ads are businesses, not individuals who use ad-blockers. The impressions of advertisements to individuals are not a supply in this case, but a business demand. Therefore, restricting demand will affect supply negatively, not positively.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: The price of advertising is not elastic, it is absolute: there are clear rates of return \(based on impressions or click throughs\) that determine the profitability of on ad on a per-user basis. Reducing the supply of ads in no way changes the profitability of each ad and thus there is no reason for prices to shift.
1.2.4.2.3. Con: Even if this is true, those higher returns would be distributed between a smaller number of companies, as there are fewer number of spots you can advertise on. This hurts smaller businesses.
1.2.4.3. Pro: Ads provide a large part of revenue for game developers.
1.2.4.3.1. Pro: Mobile games are on track to generate [$39.8 billion](http://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-game-developers-turn-to-rewarded-ads-2017-8) in ad revenue in 2017.
1.2.4.3.2. Pro: Angry Birds topped [$1 million per month](http://www.intomobile.com/2010/12/03/angry-birds-android-1-million-ad-revenue/) in ad revenue back in 2010 and its parent company, Rovio, has grown substantially since then, indicating that more recent figures could be much higher.
1.2.4.4. Pro: Newspapers have traditionally relied on advertising rather than subscriptions for revenue.
1.2.4.4.1. Con: As print media has declined, major newspapers have started to rely on [subscriptions](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/11/the-print-apocalypse-and-how-to-survive-it/506429/) rather than advertising for revenue.
1.2.4.4.1.1. Pro: After relying on advertisement in the past, newspapers like The New York Times now make [more than half](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/business/media/new-york-times-q4-earnings.html) of their revenue through circulation and subscriptions.
1.2.4.4.2. Con: Studies indicate that recently, newspaper subscriptions have gone up and this model is making newspapers like [The New York Times](http://www.businessinsider.in/The-New-York-Times-Now-Gets-More-Revenue-From-Subscribers-Than-Advertisers/articleshow/21372907.cms) and the [Wall Street Journal](https://medium.com/the-graph/advertising-vs-subscription-a4200642842e) more money than advertising.
1.2.4.5. Pro: When users block ads, online media creators lose revenue.
1.2.4.5.1. Pro: YouTube video makers like [PewDiePi](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/adblock-is-on-a-crusade-to-improve-ad-quality-at-any-cost/), who rely on ads \(and whose income is directly linked to the number of viewers that sit through ads before the video\) see a decrease in revenue when viewers run ad-block.
1.2.4.5.1.1. Con: YouTube content creators have other sources of income; they can receive income from product placement instead of advertisements.
1.2.4.5.1.1.1. Con: Product placement is the same advertisement as any other. In fact, these ads are learned through implicit means that affects people on unconscious level, so they are more cognitively invasive and dangerous, especially if they will become an overwhelming norm.
1.2.4.5.2. Pro: Running ad block while using free music streaming sites like Spotify or Pandora is essentially stealing.
1.2.5. Pro: [Approximately half](https://www.vieodesign.com/blog/new-data-why-people-hate-ads) of survey respondents agree that people who use ad-blockers need to pay for content in some other way.
1.2.6. Pro: Publishers globally lost an estimated [$22 billion](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/native-advertising-rises-as-consumers-opt-out) to ad-blocking software in 2015 alone, and it's expected that $35 billion will be lost annually by 2020.
1.2.6.1. Con: US advertising revenue for 2016 totaled about [$76 billion](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2016.pdf) whereas revenue lost to ad block software was only about [15% of that amount](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/17/adblockers-us-growth-remove-12bn-advertising-2020). Most of the money in the ad business is still intact.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: 15% of total revenue is still a significant stake and should not be written off as negligible.
1.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.5.
1.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.
1.2.9. Con: Many users opt in to other payment methods, such as subscriptions or outright purchasing media, and therefore their use of ad-blockers is not equivalent to freeloading.
1.2.9.1. Con: YouTube Red only accounted for about [5% of YouTube's 2016 revenue](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-where-youtube-red-stands-after-one-year-2017-1?IR=T) despite being heavily marketed for over a year.
1.2.9.1.1. Con: YouTube Red is unethical. It's business model consists of selling the features of downloading and background viewing, both of which were standard features offered free by both YouTube and its competators before YouTube drove out that competition and then not only removed the feature, but hunted down any 3rd party applications providing it. Such monopolistic practices are unethical, a threat to the free market, and a reason for YouTube Red's unpopularity.
1.2.9.2. Con: YouTube Red has only 1.5 million subscribers as opposed to the 1 billion free subscriptions YouTube has on its free offering. \([Elder 2017\)](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-where-youtube-red-stands-after-one-year-2017-1?IR=T)
1.2.9.2.1. Con: YouTube has not \(yet\) placed more of their content behind a paywall. If they did, their subscription numbers would likely increase. For instance, Netflix, HBOGo, ESPN and other paid-content channels have healthy subscriber numbers.
1.2.9.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.
1.2.10. Con: Freeloading is not necessarily unethical. For example if one embraces utilitarianism, one could argue that an individual's pleasure gained from experiencing websites without advertising, is higher than the pleasure the stakeholders of the company offering the service will get from the increased revenues due to advertising.
1.2.10.1. Con: Well-being of a person within utilitarism ideology is misrepresented in this claim. The fact that something is pleasurable in a short-term does not make it good for the well-being of a person in a long-term. Pleasure is not in a definition of something to be ethical. On the contrary, putting immediate pleasure first is unethical.
1.2.10.2. Con: Immediate pleasure is a primordial limbic brain function. Immediacy of sensory needs is the opposite of an ethical long-term thinking by default.
1.2.11. Con: It is a user's way of taking some small control over how their information is used. Using an ad-blocker is more ethical than the way most major media outlets misuse data.
1.3. Pro: Running an ad blocker breaks the implicit contract that the user will view content as presented by the provider.
1.3.1. Con: Advertising content is not created by the host of the website; it is not part of the "content as presented by the provider".
1.3.1.1. Con: "As presented" does not imply creation of the content, but presentation of the content.
1.3.1.2. Con: While the provider may not actually create advertisements, these are usually selected or at least approved by the provider and thus part of the package intended for the user.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Software designed by Google \(the parent owner of YouTube\) decides what ads are played before YouTube videos. Content creators have little say in the matter.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: The fact that "content creators have little say in that matter" does not support the argument "advertising content is not created by the host of the website". Content creators are not the host website. The fact that they have little say has no influence on ethical notions of ad-blocking. Content creators are the first to lose profit from ad-blocking.
1.3.2. Pro: This undermines the implicit deal on which many websites rely: that users consume the content on offer without providing anything in return but their attention.
1.3.2.1. Con: If you're not swayed by an ad then you haven't provided a return anyway. If you know ahead of time that ads don't persuade you to buy then why not block them entirely? Site hosts already know that a majority of their patrons don't bring in revenue directly and so it's implicitly understood by the provider that most people surf the site for free.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Ads do not have to result in a purchase by users in order to result in a return for the host of the website. Merely displaying ads usually results in returns for the host.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Then someone is providing revenue for no reason. Why then shouldn't the same revenue be provided for each visitor to a page, regardless of an embedded ad?
1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Most advertising in other mediums \(i.e. TV or radio\) does not rely on directly inducing users to make a purchase instantaneously; instead it raises brand awareness and provides information that might help shape future purchases. This is a valuable enough effect that advertisers are willing to pay for it.
1.3.2.1.2. Con: It's a loaded question logical fallacy. The fact that you are not swayed by the ad implies that there is no need to block the ad. This is not an argument in favor of blocking them, but an argument that says that there is no reason to block them in the first place.
1.3.3. Con: Most users are not informed of the implied terms of that contract before visiting a page: that they are opting into not just seeing ads but invasive tracking. Without being offered these terms ahead of time it is impossible for disclosure, negotiation, or consideration \(i.e. standard contractual procedures\) to occur.
1.3.3.1. Con: All users are informed and expected to read the contractual agreements and privacy policies. Not choosing to read the law, not seeking to read the law, not knowing about the law does not free you from the responsibility that follows. This applies to any law, even international law if you are in a legal relationship with a country. This is a worldwide legal standard.
1.3.3.2. Con: Elsewhere, too, it is implied that the user of contents does not object to the display of advertisement. Examples are the ads that run in the cinema as well as newspaper ads.
1.3.3.3. Con: Since the vast majority of internet pages run ads, users can reasonably predict what the page will contain. They are not caught by surprise by the presence of ads.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: Targeted advertising is directed specifically at each user. Since every user's experience on the internet is different, it is difficult to predict what ads are going to come up on one's web pages except that it will loosely be related to their recent history.
1.3.3.4. Pro: Contracting malware is not part of the implicit contract between viewer and provider either, and yet "[malvertising](https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2016/01/11/malvertising-three-things-you-need-to-know/#738fbead11f6)" - ads infected with malware - is on the rise.
1.3.3.5. Pro: Ads require targeting to be successful. To target effectively, advertisers must present ads to the persons who will find it most relevant. This in turn incentivises the widespread collection and sale of "anonymized" information about users that violates their privacy.
1.3.3.5.1. Con: Correlation is not the causality. Business needs to target their audiences is not a cause of this kind of violations. It is caused by lack of enforcement, not by the inherent business needs.
1.3.4. Con: Users agree to no contract requiring them to view one public thing in order to view another public thing. It is equally ethical to leave the room to urinate during a television commercial; one is not obligated to watch the commercial.
1.3.4.1. Con: Neither websites nor advertisements are "public things". They belong to businesses. They are private, and not yours. This analogy is ambiguous and does not represent the nature of the internet, content creation and cyber laws.
1.3.4.2. Con: Taking a toilet break is perfectly reasonable because TV ads are presented separately to the media they support. On websites, where ads and content are co-present, there is no excuse for actively obstructing the ad.
1.3.4.3. Pro: An artist who creates and displays a sculpture anyone may look at has no right to dictate that onlookers cover one eye, view the sculpture via mirror, or require any other specific action of the user in order to view the public statue.
1.3.4.4. Pro: If it is unethical to run ad blockers, then it is unethical to pay no attention to advertisements on TV or in other places. This is plainly ridiculous. People are not obliged to attend to advertisements.
1.3.4.4.1. Con: This is a composition logical fallacy. It does not justify ad blocker use. We are not obliged to pay attention, but ad-blocking is not an analogy to paying attention. It's an installed software that you choose to turn on, knowingly full well that the content provider will receive no returns on your website use and your use does not support further content creation.
1.3.4.5. Con: According to this analogy, leaving a room is your choice not to look at the ad, not blocking the ad. You can switch the channel, turn off the tv or go away. You don't have a right to modify the programming of the channel.
1.3.5. Pro: Running an ad-blocker is a conscious and deliberate decision made by users knowing full well its effects.
1.3.6. Con: This is not a real contract as it violates due process with respect to a contract signing: the person viewing the site isn't made explicitly aware of the terms of the contract, so they cannot meaningfully consent into it.
1.3.6.1. Con: The internet is young. The regulations and laws to accommodate for internet safety, privacy, distribution, ethics, psychology and a multitude of other fields to help the system become legal are still in development. The real life laws are not suitable metaphors for the system that is unable to present you with a real contract \(as of yet\).
1.3.6.2. Con: The EU already implemented the GDPR regulations that protect user data and require websites to make users explicitly aware of their data collection policies on arrival, where you have a choice to adjust your privacy settings or consent to full information exchange. It is already becoming a norm on the internet and a real contract right now. [www.csoonline.com](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3202771/data-protection/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-requirements-deadlines-and-facts.html)
1.3.7. Con: The actual implicit contract, as created by HTTP protocol in particular, and the design of the Internet in general, is that the browser \(technically known as "user agent"\) asks for and receives a stream of data. What the browser does with that data is entirely up to it. It can render all, some or none of it, in whatever fashion \(compare: text-only browsers, screen readers, etc.\). The server is entitled to not serve the content, but not to determine how the content is shown.
1.3.7.1. Con: Ad-blockers are not part of the browser, but a separate software. If they are part of the browser, only then this applies.
1.3.7.2. Con: What the browser "can" does not reflect what is adequate. Browsers do not hold responsibility for loading errors, but this does not mean they are entitled to not show the content by default.
1.3.7.3. Con: Servers are not consumers. They are a tool within a business model. They are not capable of understanding ethics, which is a human-only concept \(yet\). These analogies are not suitable in relation to what is ethical to do for a person that makes a conscious choice.
1.3.7.4. Pro: Content sent to the internet client can be manipulated as one wishes without penalty.  This includes, but is not limited to: Size, color, device, sound/volume, and even showing or hiding it.  One cannot dictate the terms of the browsing device.
1.3.7.5. Pro: No one can force you to download an image or video from the internet. To be able to see a website, you have to download that website to temporarily view it on your browser. When you enter a website you have the right to not download the elements you don't want to download.
1.3.7.5.1. Con: People see unwanted content all the time everywhere. They do not argue about why all public toilets have posters with ads. Every business out there forces people to see images and video every day, while they don't want them to be "downloaded" in their memory. People do not tear the posters off or break the screens, because they understand that this is not their property.
1.3.7.6. Con: Ad-blocking is not what the browser does with the data, but what a user does with the data.
1.3.8. Con: Actively agreeing to a contractual obligation \(if you use this software, you must follow these rules\) does not occur with ads, as the ads are offered before a user could agree to viewing them. Therefore it is not unethical to block said ads, as the user has no contractual obligation to view them.
1.3.8.1. Con: The majority of websites comply with regulations and require to consent with rules before continuing to use the service. The moment you are shown that pop-up and pressed the button, contractual obligations are in effect. The rules are not retrospecting. It’s not their intention. This does not justify to continue to use ad-blockers after the consent is made.
1.4. Con: Ads are irritating and make the internet more difficult to navigate.
1.4.1. Pro: Ads clutter a screen and make it hard for users to access desired content.
1.4.1.1. Pro: About [a third](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers) of ad clicks are accidental.
1.4.1.2. Pro: [15%](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers) of people claim that they only clicked on an ad because they were tricked into doing so.
1.4.1.3. Pro: Ads waste time when the user is working on a tight schedule.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: If the worker wastes time when "working on a tight schedule", it is his/her own responsibility. Ads are not responsible for that. The person does not have to check them or visit the websites where they are placed.
1.4.1.4. Pro: Ad blockers can be very useful on risky websites because of the fact that they can prevent pop-ups.
1.4.1.4.1. Con: Preventing pop-ups is a standard feature in popular browsers. This is not an argument in support of ad blockers.
1.4.2. Con: It is by no means a given that ads are irritating and make it hard to use websites. The providers of online services have an interest in making the ads they show unobtrusive in order to not drive away users.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Organisations like the [Coalition for Better Ads](https://www.betterads.org), which includes numerous large advertisement agencies, newspapers and companies like Google and Facebook, are [pushing voluntary standards](http://www.businessinsider.com/coaltion-of-better-ads-agree-to-standards-2017-3) to prevent annoying ads like auto-playing videos, popups and full-screen advertisements.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Google, which makes [most of its money](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020515/business-google.asp) from serving ads and is one of the world's largest advertising agencies, has been [actively discouraging](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/23/12610890/google-search-punish-pop-ups-interstitial-ads) websites from using annoying and obtrusive ads, and especially popups, by punishing them for it in search results.
1.4.2.3. Pro: [Increasing](http://www.businessinsider.com/pagefair-2017-ad-blocking-report-2017-1) use of ad-block technology pushes internet companies and others to find ways to improve user experience.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: [Google](https://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/6/5/15729688/google-chrome-ad-blocking) penalizes websites that load too slowly and pages that have more ads than content get automatically downgraded in Google search results.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: A [new feature](https://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/6/5/15729688/google-chrome-ad-blocking) of Google Chrome blocks ads, but only intrusive ads. Google also outlined the guidelines for what they consider an "annoying" ad - an ad that interrupts, distracts or clutters a page.
1.4.2.3.2.1. Con: Youtube, which is owned by Google, display ads that could be considered annoying by its own standards, since they interrupt and distract from the video content.
1.4.2.3.3. Pro: Those who rely on ad-revenue are finding new ways to make ads interesting and engaging, and thus to hold on to the viewer's attention.
1.4.2.3.3.1. Pro: Mobile games are implementing "[reward ads](http://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-game-developers-turn-to-rewarded-ads-2017-8)," which players can view in exchange for in-game prizes.
1.4.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: A recent [study](http://blog.kiip.me/developers/84-of-users-prefer-apps-with-rewards/) by [IPG Media Lab](https://www.slideshare.net/KiipTeam/moments-that-matter) shows that people are 40% more excited during an achievement moment vs. normal app usage, rewards generate 31% more user excitement than ads and 84% of people prefer rewards over banners and full-screen interstitials.
1.4.2.3.3.2. Pro: Advertisements for podcasts often rely on "[host reads](https://www.wsj.com/articles/podcasting-has-an-ad-skipping-problem-too-1468605850)," which helps the ads take on the theme of the show and helps to hold listener attention. For example, if it is a comedy show, the ads will be funny.
1.4.2.3.3.3. Pro: On YouTube, some ads come in the form of brief surveys, and some users find them to be [less annoying](http://phandroid.com/2015/09/10/youtube-android-app-survey-vs-ad/) than typical ads.
1.4.2.3.4. Con: Advertising is one of the only mechanisms small companies have to compete against larger counterparts on the internet.
1.4.2.3.4.1. Con: The ad networks themselves benefit the most from the industry, rather than advertisers or users. This can be seen with the rampant financial success of ad networks and campaign failure rates of the advertisers. By the networks siphoning out of the internet economy, advertisers lose money and end users lose time, whereas the middleman profits.
1.4.2.3.4.1.1. Con: If advertisers didn't benefit from ad networks they wouldn't purchase their services. Sourcing ads, finding the optimal price for them, and producing targeted ads is clearly a complex and valuable service if the networks are so profitable.
1.4.2.3.4.1.2. Con: No party — users, advertisers, or middleman — have any moral or fundamental claim to a portion of the internet economy. Like any market, the rewards go to those who provide the most value.
1.4.2.3.4.2. Con: There are [viable alternatives](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kaviguppta/2015/10/21/three-reasons-why-ad-blocking-will-benefit-everyone/#425de3f24810) to conventional online advertising strategies. An example of a conventional advertising strategy is to flood the web with ads.
1.4.2.3.4.2.1. Pro: Companies can [reduce the volume](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kaviguppta/2015/10/21/three-reasons-why-ad-blocking-will-benefit-everyone/#425de3f24810) of their advertisements online by better utilizing their users' data and focusing their efforts offline.
1.4.2.3.4.2.1.1. Con: Small companies will be at a significant disadvantage when trying to access their users' data.
1.4.2.3.4.3. Pro: Advertising provides a guaranteed source of revenue that scales with user growth. It thus provides new media an easy path to profitability without having to attempt [risky and complex](https://econsultancy.com/blog/66034-the-pros-and-cons-of-subscription-ecommerce-models/) business models such as subscriptions.
1.4.2.3.4.4. Con: Ads do not ensure equity but only create the perception of equity on the internet, since the benefits of advertising are felt only by the duopoly of Facebook and Google.
1.4.2.3.4.4.1. Pro: [Research](http://fortune.com/2017/01/04/google-facebook-ad-industry/) estimated that digital advertising revenue in 2015 soared by 20% from 2014 to a record of $60 billion. Close to 65% of that went to Google and Facebook.
1.4.2.3.4.4.2. Pro: A research group, Digital Content Next looked at the total ad revenue booked by Google and Facebook as a proportion of the overall industry, and found that they accounted for about [90%](https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2016/06/16/google-and-facebook-devour-the-ad-and-data-pie-scraps-for-everyone-else/) of all the growth in the digital ad business.
1.4.2.3.4.4.3. Pro: The Facebook and Google duopoly is allowed to persist since they are [not subject](https://in.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-facebook-analysis/google-facebook-show-power-of-ad-duopoly-as-rivals-stumble-idINKBN1AD1ZY) to US anti-trust laws.
1.4.2.3.4.4.4. Con: The benefits of advertising are also clearly felt by those who choose to purchase advertising; otherwise they would not do it.
1.4.2.3.4.4.5. Con: That online ad platforms make large amounts of money is not a problem with online ads in general; it just means those platforms have made very popular services that also happen to be very profitable.
1.4.2.3.4.4.6. Con: Most companies purchasing advertising are not competing with Facebook or Google so it is not a problem that purchasing ads rewards those companies.
1.4.2.3.4.5. Con: Ad revenue is generally very low for content that doesn't generate a lot of traffic already. It is usually not enough to grow a business, as evidenced by many content creators who still depend on their full time day job even if they have hundreds of thousands of followers.
1.4.2.3.4.6. Con: The companies responsible for monetizing content can have significant impact on what ads users see, which means the content creator has little control over the way their content is monetized. It's an intransparent and insecure way of earning an income. Some ads might drive users away; some might attract users. If a creator gets on the algorithm's "bad side", they might suffer a sharp decline in revenue because of it.
1.4.2.3.4.6.1. Con: The fact that lots of creators still use advertisements shows that this isn't a big deal; either they don't often end up at the "bad side", they don't know about it or they don't care.
1.4.2.3.4.7. Con: Small companies are unlikely to be able to afford ad spots on highly trafficked websites, given that there would be a lot of competition for those ad spots.
1.4.2.3.4.7.1. Con: The majority of internet ad revenue comes from network auction systems, where even the most desirable advertising spots only cost around $[10 for a thousand impressions](https://growtraffic.com/blog/2015/06/35-the-highest-earning-cost-per-impression-cpm-networks).
1.4.2.3.4.7.2. Con: This is why small companies rely on targeted advertising, or local social media advertising.
1.4.2.3.4.7.2.1. Pro: A survey of people in the marketing field concluded that [92% of responders](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-marketing-trends-for-small-business/) strongly agreed with the phrase "Social media marketing is important for my business."
1.4.2.3.4.7.2.1.1. Pro: Because you can use it to easily stay in contact, build loyalty and update your customers very easily all at once. While also being able to use it to research trends and your market as well as directly getting more leads and customers to any business.
1.4.2.3.4.7.2.2. Pro: A survey of respondents from the marketing field found that targeted advertising on Facebook dominates small business marketing [strategy](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-marketing-trends-for-small-business/).
1.4.2.3.4.7.2.3. Pro: About 43% of all internet companies spend more than half their budgets on targeted advertising and most of them expect that fraction to increase. [\(Forbes, 2015\)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2015/05/05/as-brands-turn-to-digital-advertising-to-reach-the-right-audience-focus-on-validation-is-increasing/#1f28b122272c)
1.4.2.3.4.8. Con: There is no reason to want smaller companies to survive if consumers are satisfied with the larger ones.
1.4.2.3.4.8.1. Con: For many products offered by small companies or independent producers there are no equivalents produced by large companies.
1.4.2.3.4.8.1.1. Pro: Many blogs fill a specific niche and finance themselves with advertisement.
1.4.2.3.4.8.1.1.1. Pro: [Leiter Reports](http://leiterreports.typepad.com/), a popular philosophy blog, finances itself with advertisements.
1.4.2.3.4.8.1.1.2. Pro: Economics blogs [frequently](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/) use advertisements to collect revenue.
1.4.2.3.4.8.1.2. Pro: Many small sites host niche product that reaches only a small fanbase - for example, sites that host niche movies or TV shows.
1.4.2.3.4.8.1.3. Pro: There are a large number of online stores that individual artists set up to sell customized or unique products that are unavailable at large retailers.
1.4.2.3.4.8.1.3.1. Pro: [Alma Mater](https://www.almamaterstore.in/) is an online store that was set up to capture the niche in the customizable shirt market and then expanded to include other products.
1.4.2.3.4.8.1.3.2. Pro: [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) is an online store run by a community of artists who sell their products through the platform.
1.4.2.3.4.8.1.3.3. Pro: [Custom-Made](https://www.custommade.com/gallery/custom-fine-art/) specializes in fine art that is customized based on user preferences.
1.4.2.3.4.8.2. Con: Larger companies can grow complacent, and fall into established routines of innovation and creation. Small companies offer a greater diversity of ideas and innovations to satisfy consumers, since there are many small companies and they are not established enough to grow complacent.
1.4.2.3.4.8.3. Con: Large corporate monopolies do not serve capitalism, particularly when small businesses cannot flourish into something that satisfies customers better. It is the nature of free market capitalism.
1.4.2.3.4.9. Pro: The absence of advertisements can lead to the creation of internet monopolies.
1.4.2.3.4.9.1. Pro: Monopolies are considered unethical by regular business standards.
1.4.2.3.4.9.1.1. Pro: Monopolies can overprice certain products regardless of the economics of supply and demand as they are the only sellers of said product.
1.4.2.3.4.9.1.1.1. Con: This is not always the case. Amazon, for example, [could be considered a monopoly](http://fair.org/home/amazon-now-has-monopoly-power-in-online-commerce/); however it is known for selling products at a lower price than competitors.
1.4.2.3.4.9.1.1.1.1. Con: Amazon's relentless efforts to drive prices lower have had adverse affects on the suppliers of their products. [For example](http://fortune.com/2015/07/23/why-amazon-monopoly-accusations-deserve-a-closer-look/), the Author's Guild and other bookseller associations have filed complaints against the company, as their low prices have been whittling away at authors' royalties.
1.4.2.3.4.9.1.1.1.2. Con: Amazon is known to use aggressive low price strategy to [kill off competition](http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-diapers-price-war-2010-11).
1.4.2.3.4.9.1.2. Pro: Monopolies can supply inferior products at higher profit margins in the absence of competition.
1.4.2.3.4.9.2. Pro: Monopolies make sense in industries where there is a very high up-front cost \(e.g. electricity\). Such monopolies are called 'natural monopolies'. However, this is not an issue for internet companies.
1.4.2.3.4.9.3. Con: Internet monopolies already exist. For example, Google is used for almost [70%](https://www.thebalance.com/monopoly-4-reasons-it-s-bad-and-its-history-3305945) of all web searches.
1.4.2.3.4.9.3.1. Con: Google is a creative monopoly that is able to provide service of much higher quality than any competitor. It does not take advantage of its position in the market to enforce unfair competition. As such, this monopoly is not unethical.
1.4.2.3.4.9.3.1.1. Con: The Google PageRank algorithm [preferentially displays](http://www.netcompetition.org/conflict-of-interest/why-google-is-not-neutral) the content of Google subsidiaries in an effort to eliminate competition from other companies.
1.4.2.3.4.9.3.1.1.1. Pro: Video [searches](http://www.netcompetition.org/conflict-of-interest/why-google-is-not-neutral) on Google show Google-owned YouTube results first. The same happens related to mapping inquiries — Google Maps and Google Earth almost always show up at the top of Google’s search results.
1.4.2.3.4.9.3.1.1.2. Pro: Google also provides itself specialized ad formats that are better than non-Google advertisers get.
1.4.2.3.4.9.3.2. Con: A large market share alone does not mean a company is a monopoly — the absence of viable competition and/or the ability to charge monopoly prices does.
1.4.2.3.4.9.4. Con: Internet monopolies are not necessarily bad.
1.4.2.3.4.9.4.1. Pro: The reason that companies like Amazon are able to innovate so much is that their monopoly status means that they do not have to worry about [profits](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/9/4/why-amazon-has-no-profits-and-why-it-works).
1.4.2.3.4.9.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.3.4.9.1.1.1.1.
1.4.2.3.4.9.4.1.2. Pro: Investing in innovation requires spare resources and the ability to take risks on things that may or may not pay off. High profits, or the ability not to worry about profits because of a lack of competitors for shareholders to invest in, enable this behaviour.
1.4.2.3.4.9.4.1.3. Con: The very harm of a monopoly is that they are not subject to the cost curve and can thus charge monopoly pricing. That Amazon cannot means it is not a monopoly.
1.4.2.3.4.9.4.2. Pro: It is preferable that social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat have monopolies because of network effects: we want to be on the platform that all of our friends are on. If there were more platforms, this would be more difficult.
1.4.2.3.4.9.4.2.1. Con: Facebook \(via Instagram\) and Snapchat are direct competitors in photo messaging and all three services compete as social networks. A network effect creates a 'sticky' platform but does not prevent people from using other platforms or mean that a platform is a monopoly.
1.4.2.3.4.9.5. Pro: Without advertising to attract customers, smaller internet companies would find it a lot harder to compete against the likes of Amazon, Walmart etc. in their respective categories.
1.4.2.3.5. Pro: Advertising has always evolved based on human behaviour, this will only be a catalyst for advertising to evolve. Ethics or not, you can never force someone to do or not do something against their will
1.4.2.4. Con: Despite the fact that providers have that interest, it is clearly not enough given how many ads are currently obtrusive.
1.4.3. Pro: Advertisements adversely affect load time of webpages.
1.4.3.1. Pro: About 50% of consumers expect a website to load in 2 seconds or less, and about [75%](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers) will abandon a website that takes more than 5 seconds to load. Since ads slow a website's load time, that means that they are costing sites significant amounts of potential visitors.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: [Kissmetrics](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/) found that since a 1 second delay in load time can lead to a 7% reduction in conversions, then if an e-commerce site makes $100,000 per day that delay could potentially cost $2.5 million in lost sales annually.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: According to the same Kissmetrics study, only about [25%](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/) of people would abandon a site that takes more than 5 seconds to load. This suggests that users are actually far more patient than the above source claims.
1.4.3.2. Con: A [study](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html) also found that ad-blockers caused some websites to load erratically and that one site even crashed repeatedly when an ad-blocker was enabled.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: If adblockers cause websites to load more slowly, then consumers can choose not to use them. The fact that they are widely employed indicates that there are no significant adverse consequences in terms of loading time.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: There may still be adverse consequences in terms of loading time, but users choose to continue using the ad-blocker because the benefits outweigh the impact of said consequences.
1.4.3.3. Pro: This [study](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html) tested the load times of home pages both with and without ad-blockers, and found that when ad-blockers were enabled most websites loaded much faster and felt easier to use.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: Most newspapers and magazines would be lighter and easier to read without advertisements, too, and TV would be more convenient to watch without commercials. But in those mediums advertisements are accepted and not perceived as a problem.
1.4.3.3.1.1. Con: DVR's have allowed people to skip over TV commercials. While the practice of skipping commercials may or may not be ethical, the industry has adapted with various methods including product placement and by increasing the convenience to watch ads by shortening them while making content available on-demand.
1.4.3.4. Pro: Slow load time hurts content creators but advertisers are largely able to escape any negative consequences. Therefore ad creators have little incentive to change their behavior or to create ads which load quickly.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Advertisements slow down website load time and have the potential to deter users from using websites.
1.4.3.4.1.1. Con: If a user is deterred from visiting a website, then they will also not view the ad present on that website; so slow-to-load ads harm advertisers as well.
1.4.3.4.2. Pro: If a page takes too long to load and if the reader is on a slow connection, the page times out and doesn't load and the reader never sees the content.
1.4.3.4.3. Con: Slow-to-load advertisements can annoy internet users sufficiently to close the tab, video, or site with the advertisement.
1.4.3.4.4. Con: Publishers can and do hold advertisers accountable for the negative effects they have on load time through a variety of monitoring methods, such as [Google's pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/) and [Mozilla/Firefox Browser tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Performance).
1.4.3.4.5. Pro: On [Google](https://www.vox.com/new-money/2017/6/5/15729688/google-chrome-ad-blocking), websites that load too slowly are penalized and pages that have too many ads get automatically downgraded in Google search results.
1.4.3.4.6. Con: Advertisers compete for ad space, and there is therefore pressure on them to make their ads more amenable to website hosts.
1.4.4. Pro: Loading ads uses up consumers' data plans, essentially making consumers pay to view ads.
1.4.4.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html) by the New York Times of the top 50 mobile news websites found that more than half of all data used comes from ads and other content filtered by ad-blockers.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Other mediums reach similar content-to-advertisement ratios and are, in contrast to ad-financed websites, usually not free.
1.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: The ratio between editorial content and advertisements in most print magazines has been about 50-50 in the past decades \([Greco, p. 138](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Hk-2BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=advertisement+editorial+content+relation+magazines+50-50&source=bl&ots=GB0DdlWz1E&sig=VpRnk79X9FOJpf8tPrlyVzjOxpU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiX0brI0d_VAhWCWrwKHc5SC6wQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=advertisement%20editorial%20content%20relation%20magazines%2050-50&f=false)\).
1.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: Advertisement on television, even when the user pays for cable TV, usually makes up [a quarter](http://time.com/96303/tv-commercials-increasing/) of broadcast time.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: The [study](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html) found that between 6 and 68% of the download data was from JavaScript, which is used to deliver the more interactive elements of ads.
1.4.4.1.3. Pro: The [study](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html) found that visiting the home page of Boston.com every day for a month would cost $9.50 in data usage just for the ads.
1.4.4.2. Pro: A [study](http://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/snfchs/pdfs/Adblock.Plus.Study.pdf) found that computers running AdBlock Plus saw a 25% decrease in data usage during web browsing sessions and a 40% decrease in data usage during video viewing sessions.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: The study showed that using ad-block software, like AdBlock Plus, and thus reducing network data demand, has the potential to generate substantial savings for large data consumers \(like universities or businesses\).
1.4.4.3. Pro: [In the developing world](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/technology/ad-blocking-internet.html?mcubz=1&_r=0), ad-block software is primarily used by people to save on costly data plans by removing data-hungry advertisements.
1.4.5. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.5.
1.4.6. Pro: Mobile apps powered by advertisements [drain smartphone batteries](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2015/04/01/free-app-ads-kill-phone-battery-and-data/#53d5a31f23cc). Those apps can eat up as much as 33% more energy than apps without ads.
1.4.6.1. Con: Reduced battery drain can be considered a feature of the premium version which does not contain ads.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: You shouldn't request money to not alter someone's items. It is both illegal and immoral.
1.4.7. Pro: Ads often open other tabs or webpages, which then open other tabs or webpages, some of which cannot be closed without altering code or restarting the browser.
1.4.7.1. Con: This is clearly an abuse of people's browsing experience, and has been mostly mitigated by pop-up blockers which are built in to every major modern browser.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Multiple ad pages open on the same machine can make [CPU usage](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3075472/internet/a-web-page-consumes-a-constant-25-of-the-cpu-after-it-has-loaded.html) skyrocket, ultimately slowing down the computer.
1.4.8. Con: Online advertisements can help users find alternatives and often cheaper products they wouldn't otherwise know about.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Users can be directed to redeemable coupons or limited period discounts which they would otherwise be unaware of.
1.4.8.2. Pro: Small scale, cheaper companies advertise competing deals on larger websites like Amazon or Macy's to attract customers.
1.4.8.3. Con: The presence of these potential benefits is irrelevant. Users can weigh up the costs and benefits, and if they decide to use adblockers, this indicates that ads are on the whole harmful to them.
1.4.9. Pro: Consumer surveys have shown that various types of advertisements have high disapproval ratings.
1.4.9.1. Pro: Only about [40%](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers) of people click on ads because they are actually interested.
1.4.9.2. Con: The [same studies](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers) have also shown that the majority of people are fine with seeing ads so long as they are not annoying or disruptive.
1.4.9.3. Pro: A [Reuters study](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Reuters%20Institute%20Digital%20News%20Report%202015_Full%20Report.pdf) found that one in three people in the US and the UK avoid sites where ads interfere with the content.
1.4.9.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.5.
1.4.9.5. Pro: One [survey](https://www.vieodesign.com/blog/new-data-why-people-hate-ads) found that pop-up ads have a 73% disapproval rating -- the highest of any type of ad.
1.4.9.5.1. Con: Popups are of little relevance anymore. Popup-blockers have been integrated into all major browsers and many advertisers perceive them as doing more harm than good.
1.4.9.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.4.9.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.
1.4.9.6. Pro: [82%](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/native-advertising-rises-as-consumers-opt-out) of people report that they have closed a web page because of an auto-playing video ad, while 81% say that they have closed a web page due to a pop-up ad.
1.4.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.3.1.
1.4.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.3.2.
1.4.12. Con: Being irritating has no effect on whether something is ethical.
1.4.13. Pro: Despite targeted advertising one still gets to see advertising of products and services that she/he will never consider buying. That form of advertising is annoying and unnecessary.
1.5. Con: Blocking ads is a matter of security; online ads can spread malicious software and threaten cyber security.
1.5.1. Pro: Modern ad implementation is dangerous \(malware\) and unethical \(harvests data without consent - one way FB shows you ads about sites you visited separate from them\).  Until ads are regulated / sites act responsibly / protections are added and enforced, users have to protect themselves.
1.5.2. Con: This is mediated by malware detection software and anti-viruses. This does not justify ad-blockers. The person chooses to press on the malicious ads or chooses to go to unsafe websites that anti-viruses and malware detection software as well as operating system explicitly ask to avoid. It is a question of lack of media literacy, not the presence of ads themselves.
1.5.2.1. Con: Malicious ads in modern security threats do not require clicking. They can and do try to load as part of the initial communication that loads the ad. Good spyware can limit impact most but not all of the time.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Nothing can limit everything all the time. This is not an adequate reason to consider ad-blocking ethical.
1.5.3. Pro: "[Malvertising](https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2016/01/11/malvertising-three-things-you-need-to-know/)" - ads infected with malware - is a growing problem.
1.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.5.3.2. Con: This is an argument to implement a better enforcement on the quality of ads, not a justification of whether the ad-blockers are ethical.
1.5.3.3. Pro: Sites that show malicious ads, and the providers of the ad, are never held responsible for the damage they cause.
1.5.3.4. Pro: [Ads infected with malware](https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2016/01/11/malvertising-three-things-you-need-to-know/) purposefully targets trusted sites with high traffic, like YouTube or Reuters, and can infect computers before the user clicks on anything.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: [MSN.com](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2016/06/truth-in-malvertising-how-to-beat-bad-ads/), a site with 1.3 billion monthly viewers, was hit by a malvertising attack in 2016.
1.5.3.4.2. Pro: In 2015, hackers exploited [a vulnerability in Yahoo ads](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/03/hackers-exploit-flash-vulnerability-in-yahoo-ads/?ref=technology&_r=0), and potentially infected millions of computers.
1.5.3.4.3. Pro: In January 2016, [Forbes](https://www.extremetech.com/internet/220696-forbes-forces-readers-to-turn-off-ad-blockers-promptly-serves-malware) forced users to disable ad-block to view content and then promptly infected users with malware.
1.5.3.5. Pro: Malvertising is almost impossible to trace because of its indirect attack method, and thus attackers are almost [guaranteed anonymity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2016/01/11/malvertising-three-things-you-need-to-know/).
1.5.3.5.1. Pro: The buying and selling of ad slots is [automated](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21695388-worries-about-fraud-and-fragmentation-may-prompt-shake-out-crowded-online-ad), or "programatic," which was intended to make online advertising easier, but it also makes it much harder to trace where and from whom ads come from.
1.5.3.5.1.1. Pro: [Online ad slot trading](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21695388-worries-about-fraud-and-fragmentation-may-prompt-shake-out-crowded-online-ad) is complex and fast, with thousands of firms analysing consumer data and buying, selling, and monitoring ads. Middlemen "repackage" ad slots and sell them to other middlemen. An ad impression sold in this way can change hands 15 times before being bought by an advertiser.
1.5.3.6. Pro: Criminals can [borrow marketing tactics](https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2016/01/11/malvertising-three-things-you-need-to-know/) and configure ads to attack certain types of victims.
1.5.3.7. Pro: According to the [Interactive Advertising Bureau](https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2016/01/11/malvertising-three-things-you-need-to-know/#738fbead11f6), the digital advertising industry loses $1.1 billion a year to malvertising.
1.5.3.8. Con: Ad-blocking is not [necessarily the solution](https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2016/01/11/malvertising-three-things-you-need-to-know/#738fbead11f6) to malvertising; it hurts those who produce genuine digital content while those with malicious intent will find other ways to get malware on to users' computers.
1.5.3.8.1. Pro: Malicious ads are often found on trusted sites. Those sites often rely on advertising and ask users to disable their ad-block software, making ad-block software irrelevant.
1.5.3.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.4.1.
1.5.3.8.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.4.2.
1.5.3.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.4.3.
1.5.3.8.2. Con: There are many other channels for malware: for example, emails and messaging programs. Blocking ads just causes malware creators to shift to those platforms.
1.5.3.8.2.1. Con: If that was a valid con, then it consequently means that there should be no effort to block email or messaging either as the malware will just move to next thing...and so on.
1.5.3.8.2.2. Con: That's why most email and messaging services have built-in spam filters that are in constant development. It is not reasonable to consider harmful content okay in an email context, but not on a website.
1.5.3.8.2.3. Con: Blocking a channel for an intruder can indeed incentivize the intruder to work another channel.  This does not suggest one simply stop and allow the intruder to invade. Analogies to country borders home protection and bodily assault easily show this.
1.5.4. Pro: According to a 2016 poll, [security](http://www.businessinsider.com/pagefair-2017-ad-blocking-report-2017-1) was the main reason cited for downloading ad-block technology.
1.5.5. Pro: Some [cyber security experts](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601057/are-ad-blockers-needed-to-stay-safe-online/) say that adblock technology is necessary to stay safe online.
1.5.5.1. Pro: [Edward Snowden](https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/12/9723314/edward-snowden-ad-blocking) said that "using an ad blocker is not just a right but a duty".
1.5.6. Pro: Ads infected with malware can [inject computers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2016/01/11/malvertising-three-things-you-need-to-know/#738fbead11f6) with spyware, ransomware, nuisanceware, or infect computers with bots, and they are virtually indistinguishable from regular ads.
1.5.6.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.5.7. Con: -> See 1.5.3.8.2.
1.5.8. Con: Blocking insecure and "unacceptable" ads can be done without blocking all advertisement - [this is the default setting](https://www.kialo.com/is-it-unethical-to-use-ad-blockers-2364/2364.0=2364.1-2364.32+2364.313+2364.478) for the most widely used adblocker.
1.6. Con: Computer users should have the right to control what runs on their machines. This extends to the right to prevent third parties, such as publishers, running programs \(i.e. ads\) that the user finds undesirable.
1.6.1. Pro: A client has the right to filter internet content based on subjective terms. One cannot force consumers to watch content they disapprove of, morally or otherwise.
1.6.2. Con: Ads are usually not considered a program. They are simply images that are being displayed, just like many other images that users might see without agreeing to.
1.6.2.1. Con: Most modern ad networks serve ads that are much more complex than just a simple image or text; instead they contain sophisticated javascript code that [actively records users' behaviour and reports this back to a central database](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-do-advertisers-track-you-online-we-found-out/).
1.6.2.2. Con: Javascript, Java and Flash ads can interact with your machine much more closely than just a picture or video playing in your browser.
1.6.2.3. Con: Cookies and social media connectivity embedded within sites can be used to track you, your purchases, and what you view/like.
1.6.2.3.1. Con: The value this tracking provides to the advertisers is part of what pays for the content.
1.6.2.3.2. Con: Cookies are useful tools that internet websites need to use to track their users and provide better services. They are not exclusive to the advertising domain.
1.6.2.3.2.1. Pro: [Cookies](http://www.whatarecookies.com/) are a convenient way for services to carry information from one session on a webpage to another, or between sessions on related webpages, without having to burden a server machine with massive amounts of data storage.
1.6.2.3.3. Con: You consent to these cookies before using the website. You are not forced to use them, you choose to use them.
1.6.2.3.3.1. Con: Many websites do not offer cookie notification notices and are based in jurisdictions that do not enforce cookie-consent regulations.
1.6.2.3.3.2. Con: Users may consent to cookies under false pretences; not knowing that the cookie will be used to trace their behaviour across the wider web rather than just on one specific website.
1.6.2.3.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.6.2.3.3.2.2. Con: This is not a debate about cookies and lack of media literacy among consumers, but about ad-blockers ethical concerns that block an income stream for content creators.
1.6.2.3.3.2.3. Con: Ad-blockers do not address data collection issues, only ads.
1.6.2.4. Con: A user is free to prevent their own browser from displaying images, words, pages, or any other content which they have disabled or otherwise filtered out. Ads are no different.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.5.
1.6.4. Con: The right to own the media that runs on one's device is not honored by the courts.  We own the machine, and a right to temporarily use certain software we purchase, under certain user guidelines. But we don't own the software any more than the music we buy and download; else copyright laws would not apply.
1.6.4.1. Con: Preventing the running of software has no bearing on ownership of said software, thus copyright law does not apply.
1.6.4.1.1. Con: Preventing ads from running is not the same as a prevention of running a software. It's a modification of the website structure that was not intended by the creators who have the legal right to bundle their content with said ads. Modification of software functionality that a person does not have a copyright for or uses under specific licence is also illegal.
1.6.4.2. Con: United State copyright law guarantees the creator rights to [reproduction, adaptation, publication, and performance.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) Downloading copyrighted content is not illegal, as the "reproduction" piece is only infringed by the uploading party.
1.6.4.2.1. Con: The argument omitted the part of the law that involves "distribution". Downloading copyrighted content is distribution. Therefore, the same copyright laws apply. [malegislature.gov](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter266/Section143A)  [malegislature.gov](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter266/Section143E)
1.6.4.3. Pro: Generally, users agree to a contract that stipulates the exact nature of use for each piece of software they voluntarily use. It would be illegal and unethical to break that contract.
1.6.4.4. Con: This ignores the fact that advertisements \(or any online content\) is displayed through a web browser. That browser dictates how the content is viewed \(including which media is or is not shown\). When that browser uses an [open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses) \(as several [popular](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=firefox-com) [browsers](https://www.chromium.org) do\) the user has the right to use and modify the behaviour of that software as they wish.
1.6.4.4.1. Con: Users have a right to modify the software, not the websites shown on that software. Open-source licenses do not extend there.
1.6.4.5. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.6.5. Pro: Most modern web advertising might appear as images or text, but are typically sophisticated programs that use tracking to collect information about a user's viewing patterns and build up a model of their behaviour. Users would not consent to running such a program on its own.
1.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.
1.6.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.6.5.3. Con: If the user does not consent, he/she should not be running them in the first place. It is not a valid argument, when a person does not consent, but continues to use the apps that require it.
1.6.6. Pro: Users customize their personal online experience based on their requirements and tastes - ad-blockers are just an extension of those settings. Similar to setting the color, font size, window size and search engine settings, ad-blockers are simply a way to customize the way a page is viewed and its contents.
1.6.6.1. Con: Changing the colour or font size of your window does not harm the financial viability of many companies the way that using an ad blocker does. Because of this, the former is moral, while the latter is not.
1.6.6.1.1. Con: Users have no moral obligation to maximise the profitability of a company, particularly when it comes at the cost of making an experience unpleasant. If a car or house that you purchased came with a painted-on advertisement for the company that sold it to you, the fact that you now own that house or car should mean that you can paint it however you'd like.
1.6.6.1.1.1. Con: The case of viewing websites is different from buying a car or a house because no transaction typically occurs.
1.6.6.2. Con: Customisation does not imply going against the platform requirements or needs. Customisation is modification to suit a particular task. It's about rolling your seat back in a plane, not about removing the seat. It's about receiving customized notifications, when new music albums become available, not about listening music for free.
1.6.7. Con: Having the right to do something doesn't necessarily mean it's ethical. For example, historically slave owners in the US had the right to own slaves, but it was never ethical to do so. The above argument therefore misses the point of the question.
1.6.7.1. Con: Rights granted by the state to its citizens are an endorsement that the state considers it legitimate for its citizens to exercise those rights.
1.6.7.2. Con: Views on ethics and morality evolve in society over time. What is considered unethical by the majority today was not necessarily viewed as unethical back in the day.
1.6.8. Pro: Just as advertisers have the right to advertise on the internet so users have the right not to view said advertisements; and since websites don't provide the option to ad-block, viewers/subscribers should be able to choose whether or not to block ads themselves.
1.6.8.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.4.1.
1.6.9. Con: There are many instances where we accept that users cannot control what loads on their machines, so there cannot be an absolute right to such control.
1.6.9.1. Pro: Computer users have a right to control what runs on their machines, not what runs on the websites that do not belong to them. This is achieved by not visiting the websites with ads, not by blocking the ads on the websites that do not belong to your machine.
1.6.9.2. Pro: Users cannot control what ads will come up, but neither can they control what other content websites will put on their webpages. So they do not have an absolute right to control what runs on their machine.
1.6.9.2.1. Con: Users choose to run the content on their machine by going to the website or clicking on a link, but they have no such mechanism of control with respect to advertisements.
1.6.9.3. Con: Users have absolute control over what runs on their machines by actively selecting or deselecting which specific applications to run. It is entirely possible to have a computer with no applications, entirely third-party applications, or entirely user-created applications, with any mix in between.
1.6.10. Pro: The PC user has a right to use an ad blocker. The web site has a right to demand that the user turn off the blocker to see the content \(some sites even demand you buy a subscription\). The user can then either comply or find another source. All is legal and ethical. This is the implicit contract, the result of a free and fair negotiation. It's called freedom of choice.
1.6.10.1. Con: The fact that something is legal or your own choice does not make something ethical.
1.6.10.2. Con: The premise of the thesis is that a person does not want to comply and continues to use ad-blocker instead of finding another source. This stops to be ethical or legal at this point.
1.7. Con: Advertising creates harmful incentives for web publishers. Running blockers will help push them to adopt better business models.
1.7.1. Pro: If a content provider decides to allow advertising they become incentivised to use whatever advertising method provides the best payouts which tends to be those that are most highly-targeted and create the most tracking data. This creates a race to the bottom that incentivises advertisers and publishers to produce ever more potent and harmful ads.
1.7.2. Pro: Some ad blockers only block ads that do not meet certain quality and privacy criteria and in doing so offer incentives for advertisers to create better ads.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Some ad-blockers allow advertisers to pay for their ads to be "whitelisted." With whitelisting, ads that meet certain criteria are allowed through the ad-block for a price.
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: [Crystal](https://digiday.com/media/ad-blocking-crystal/), an ad-block app for mobile phones, allows advertisers to pay to "whitelist" their ads.
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: In default mode, [Adblock Plus](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/14/adblock-plus-defends-new-whitelisting-ad-platform.html) allows through "whitelisted" ads. Acceptable ads are determined by[user-generated criteria](https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads#criteria) \(placement, size, distinction, etc\).
1.7.2.1.3. Con: Whitelisting by ad-blockers can be considered unethical, because they are essentially selling an advert which was already sold.
1.7.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.3.2.
1.7.2.3. Con: Allowing certain ads [undermines the positive effects](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601057/are-ad-blockers-needed-to-stay-safe-online/) of ad-block software. Adblock Plus's criteria for "acceptable ads" doesn't include mention of security, and it is unlikely adblock software companies have the resources to screen out malicious ads.
1.7.2.4. Con: Allowing certain ads through ad blockers with a transaction fee or white list fee undermines the standards or incentives for better ads.
1.7.3. Pro: Advertising-based business models pay publishers on the basis of how many times users view content. They thus incentivise publications to create content that get users to initially load a page; even if users do not actually read or enjoy the actual content on it. This directly leads to the use of sensationalist headlines and other 'click bait' techniques.
1.7.3.1. Con: Click bait is purely intended to draw the user's attention. Click bait by itself is not unethical as it is no different from a catchy headline in a newspaper, a racy trailer for a movie or a hook at the beginning of a speech.
1.7.3.2. Con: The success of clickbait as a business model indicates that people are genuinely interested in consuming that sort of content. Given that, there is nothing wrong with the increasing popularity of clickbait.
1.7.3.2.1. Con: Internet content, particularly clickbait, has [semi-](http://www.bioethics.net/news/the-genetics-of-internet-addiction/)[addictive](http://www.bioethics.net/2017/09/a-modest-proposal/), semi-compulsive properties. The mere fact that people click on clickbait does not imply that clickbait is actually valuable to them.
1.7.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.
1.7.3.4. Pro: The proliferation of clickbait creates a "race to the bottom," as businesses that focus on more substantive content creation are outcompeted by clickbait businesses, and are therefore forced to being producing clickbait themselves.
1.7.3.5. Pro: The omnipresence of clickbait normalises media consumers to a superficial, uninformative type of media consumption.
1.7.3.5.1. Con: Most clickbait is disappointing because it is a promise of value that is not met — the payoff is not nearly as good as what the reader imagines.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.5.
1.7.5. Con: Blocking legitimate ads creates an even greater harmful incentive: the publications of sponsored content by outlets people rely on for factual information.
1.7.5.1. Pro: Sponsored content takes the form of published articles and news, and often appears as legitimate research.
1.7.5.1.1. Pro: Customers are manipulated and never recognize an ad as an ad. Individual belief is persuaded in direct opposition to indisputable, objective truth. Faithful purchasing is therefore done under false pretenses and is akin to being taken by a con-artist. From these types of business practice, consumers do have legal protections.
1.7.6. Con: Web visitors are unlikely to respond well to tactics such as direct charges, and are then more likely to resort to piracy and torrenting.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Piracy causes content producers to lose more money than the amount lost through ad blockers.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: The music industry reported losses of [$12.5 billion](https://www.go-gulf.com/blog/online-piracy/) in 2015 due to piracy compared to the [$781 million](http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/how-online-industry-losing-8-billion-every-year-168389/) lost due to ad blockers.
1.7.6.1.2. Pro: [71,060 jobs and $2.7 billion](https://www.go-gulf.com/blog/online-piracy/) in workers’ earnings are lost in the United States every year due to online piracy.
1.7.6.1.3. Pro: [$59 billion](https://www.go-gulf.com/blog/online-piracy/) of software was illegally downloaded in 2010. This number is only increasing.
1.7.6.2. Pro: Users put themselves at risk by undertaking illegal actions such as piracy.
1.7.6.2.1. Con: No one is forced to pirate content. Just because it is not available for free does not push anyone into illegal activities.
1.7.6.2.1.1. Pro: The act of illegally downloading content is a conscious choice that the user makes, fully aware that the action is illegal.
1.7.6.2.2. Pro: Users [cannot be assured](https://www.opswat.com/blog/why-avoid-film-piracy-its-illegal-and-dangerous) that the media they are downloading is free of malicious malware.
1.7.6.2.3. Pro: Users may have large media companies [suing them](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-12/dallas-buyers-club-case-abandoned-illegal-dowloads-pirate/7162180) for copyright infringement.
1.7.6.3. Con: The success of platforms like Spotify and Netflix as well as the growing numbers of digital newspaper subscribers show that users are willing to pay for content if done right.
1.7.6.3.1. Pro: A 2016 research study commissioned by the Intellectual Property Office \(IPO\), which is tasked with fighting copyright infringement, found that [15%](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/07/04/internet-piracy-falls-to-record-lows-amid-rise-of-spotify-and-ne/) of internet users illegally accessed films, music and other material between March and May 2016. This is down from 18% a year ago, a record drop in figures.
1.7.6.3.2. Pro: An 2016 IPO study also found that [44%](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/07/04/internet-piracy-falls-to-record-lows-amid-rise-of-spotify-and-ne/) of internet users are using exclusively legal means to access internet content, up from 39% at the end of 2015.
1.7.7. Pro: Alternative monetisation strategies such as native advertising, subscriptions, and micro-transactions are better for the media ecosystem, users and publishers in the long term. Users help push companies toward adopting these models by blocking ads.
1.7.7.1. Con: Native advertising - ads that are interspersed with and assume the format and appearance of the host content - is more harmful and deceiving than regular advertising as most users do not even know that their attention is being lured away by the ad. \(Example: this [NYT article](https://paidpost.nytimes.com/netflix/women-inmates-separate-but-not-equal.html?mcubz=1)\)
1.7.7.1.1. Con: Native advertising is usually flagged \(for example, a sponsored or branded article is usually labeled as such\). If these flags are deceiving or easily overlooked that is a problem with the design of that site, not with native advertising as a format.
1.7.7.1.1.1. Con: A [Reuters survey](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Reuters%20Institute%20Digital%20News%20Report%202015_Full%20Report.pdf) found there was a great inconsistency in labeling sponsored content - sites could use language like "paid for", "sponsored by", or "promoted". Language changes from site to site, making it difficult for users to differentiate.
1.7.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Those words are all pretty unambiguous in flagging that content is either produced by a third party or otherwise distinct from normal content.
1.7.7.1.1.2. Con: Native advertising posts are usually flagged. For example The New York Times prefaces all sponsored content with the link paidpost.nytimes.com. This should be very apparent to the user.
1.7.7.1.1.2.1. Con: The average user is unlikely to read the URL of every site that they visit.
1.7.7.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Even if this is true, content providers are doing their due diligence to site visitors by amending their links to indicate a sponsored post.
1.7.7.1.1.2.2. Con: This assumes that all users are tech savvy, when in fact these flags would not be apparent to those who are less familiar with the complexities of the internet.
1.7.7.1.2. Pro: A [Reuters survey](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Reuters%20Institute%20Digital%20News%20Report%202015_Full%20Report.pdf) found that 33% of UK readers and 43% of US readers felt disappointed or deceived when they found out later that the news content they were reading was sponsored by a brand or company.
1.7.7.1.3. Con: Readers do not like advertising that [interrupts their reading experience](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-hated-advertising-techniques/), and native advertising has the potential to blend in with content \(with all the pros and cons that entails\).
1.7.7.1.3.1. Con: A [Reuters survey](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Reuters%20Institute%20Digital%20News%20Report%202015_Full%20Report.pdf) found that consumer attitudes show that in regard to native advertising, the stakes are far higher for news brands than for advertisers. Blurring the lines can harm news brands' credibility with little lasting harm for advertisers.
1.7.7.1.3.2. Pro: A [study](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-hated-advertising-techniques/) found that ads that "blended in with content" recieved the most positive response from participants, although the survey also noted that participants "vehemently disliked" deceptive links that did not make it clear they were sponsored content.
1.7.7.1.4. Pro: Sponsored content affects the integrity and independence of news sources.
1.7.7.1.4.1. Con: Certain areas of news, such as entertainment, lifestyle, fashion, or travel, could be more appropriate for native advertising \(sponsored content\).
1.7.7.1.4.1.1. Pro: Brands are already well-interspersed in these areas, and so sponsored content might be more acceptable.
1.7.7.1.4.1.2. Con: Entertainment, lifestyle, fashion or sports are parts of the news cycle that are more susceptible to speculation than others. As such sponsored content could dilute the quality of coverage even further.
1.7.7.1.4.2. Pro: If content is sponsored by an outside party, the reader cannot know if it has been vetted and is reliable.
1.7.7.1.4.2.1. Con: Publishers and Editors build reputations over time, and maintain them by avoiding [conflicts of interest.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest)
1.7.7.2. Con: Micro transactions are significantly limited in their scope and are used only by games \(e.g. Temple Run, Candy Crush\). Most online vendors do not have the option of using them.
1.7.7.2.1. Con: Many services, such as [Blendle](https://launch.blendle.com), offer the ability to easily receive micro-transactions to established publishers. Even the use of a Paypal-based 'tip jar' offers a reasonably easy manner to quickly offer small amounts of financial support.
1.7.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.2.2.1.2.1.4.6.
1.7.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.7.7.4. Pro: Native advertising, such as sponsored posts, matches the format of the publisher and is thus both less obtrusive and more appealing to readers.
1.7.7.4.1. Con: Surveys find that native advertising is not appealing to consumers. According to surveys, [40](http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/essays/2015/attitudes-to-advertising/) to [50%](https://contently.com/strategist/2015/09/08/article-or-ad-when-it-comes-to-native-no-one-knows/) of those who discover that supposedly editorial content is sponsored feel disappointed or deceived; six out of ten believe that news sites loose credibility when using native advertisement.
1.7.7.4.1.1. Con: Most alternative forms of web ads that violate user's privacy and slow their browsing are also likely not appealing to consumers.
1.7.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.7.7.4.2. Con: Passing off sponsored content as legitimate research is a far greater breach of any social contract/trust than blocking ads.
1.7.7.4.3. Con: -> See 1.7.7.1.4.
1.7.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.
1.7.7.6. Pro: The question should not be "is it unethical to run ad-blockers?", but rather "Is it ethical to consume content without compensating the site for making it available?".
1.7.8. Con: The fact that more technologically proficient users use adblockers incentivises ad companies to design even more predatory ads in order to prey on the technologically unproficient, who are the only ones to see the ads.
1.7.8.1. Pro: Ads might attempt to be more actively deceptive, trying to trick users into making unnecessary purchases.
1.7.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.7.8.2. Pro: If legitimate actors like companies stop buying adspace because it is less profitable, less ethical producers of ads might buy more adspace and insert ads that contain malware or link to dangerous sites.
1.7.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.3.
1.7.10. Con: These new business models are likely to be things like directly charging for the service the website provides \(for example, premiums for access to news media\). This is more harmful to users than ads are.
1.7.10.1. Con: A simple subscription model, like many newspapers and other content platforms have adopted for their websites, can hardly be described as particularly harmful for users.
1.7.10.1.1. Pro: Paying for content with money instead of attention \(to ads\) can be preferable for people in some cases.
1.7.10.1.1.1. Pro: Some readers may prefer to support a publication directly to avoid distracting \(or misleading\) ads being placed alongside the journalism. Many newspapers have set up donation sites to support this.
1.7.10.1.1.2. Pro: Some users may prefer paying a small monthly premium to access the features of social networking sites in return for not being tracked for advertising purposes.
1.7.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.7.11. Pro: Digital advertisers do their best to [gamify](http://www.bunchball.com/gamification) people's attention with disinformation and sensationalism. To the extent these practices rely on advertising, blockers disencentivize this shift.
1.7.12. Pro: Bad advertisements destroy trust between consumers and the industry as a whole. Ad blockers create a filter to restore that trust.
1.7.12.1. Pro: Using an ad-blocker which selectively blocks ads based on the user's preferences \(such as  [Ad-Block Plus's 'Acceptable Ads'](https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads)\) provides an effective avenue for users to signal to websites and ad-networks what kinds of ads are tolerable/acceptable.
1.8. Con: Ads are an invasion of users' privacy.
1.8.1. Pro: A [survey](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/native-advertising-rises-as-consumers-opt-out) of 400 respondents found that the misuse of personal information was the primary reason why users enabled ad-blocking.
1.8.1.1. Con: What respondents think is not relevant to support an argument for invasion on privacy. Everyone may think there is an invasion. It does not mean that there really is one.
1.8.1.2. Con: Survey is a method of self-reporting that is based on respondents assumptions. It is more representative of lack of media literacy of respondents than the fact that ads are an invasion of privacy.
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.5.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.3.
1.8.4. Pro: Consolidation amongst online advertisers and analytics companies means that ads can easily track user behaviour across many websites, and in doing so develop a comprehensive record of a user's behaviour and interests.
1.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.
1.8.4.2. Pro: In sum this consolidation amongst providers allows advertisers to build up a much more comprehensive profile of our private interests and personal information — something that users do not consent to.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: Yes, they consent every time they start to use the service the moment they register an account and press "accept the privacy policy" or "accept cookies". This is a documented consent. If a person signed a contract, it does not matter whether he thinks he consents or holds crossed fingers behind his/her back, for that matter. This does not free a person from the responsibility to comply.
1.8.4.3. Pro: Most online advertising runs through a handful of major platforms, [such as Facebook or Google](http://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2017/google-and-facebook-are-killing-adtech-funding/). These platforms can then easily track users across large portions of the internet, as any page with their ads can cross-reference unique identifiers and build up a profile of the user \(even if that user doesn't use Google or Facebook's services\).
1.8.4.3.1. Con: This is not an argument in favor of ad-blocking. This is an argument against social media in general.
1.8.4.4. Con: It is not an invasion of privacy, when the user explicitly agreed to the tracking before starting to use the service.
1.8.4.5. Con: The effects of this are not purely negative. This allows to tailor content for user needs and optimise systems to provide better service.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.8.6. Con: Governments are enacting legislation to protect users' privacy from online advertising.
1.8.6.1. Pro: The forthcoming European Union General Data Protection Regulation \([GDPR](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/16/eu-agrees-draft-text-pan-european-data-privacy-rules)\) will tighten up data privacy. It will impose stringent new rules, which will force companies to get “unambiguous consent” from online users to make use of their data.
1.8.6.2. Pro: The [FTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission) has a public [list of guidelines](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/advertising-marketing-internet-rules-road#non) for businesses to follow while advertising their products online. Punishments for violations are also clearly listed.
1.8.6.3. Con: In March 2017, the U.S. Congress [overturned a broadband privacy regulation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/opinion/republicans-attack-internet-privacy.html?mcubz=1&_r=0), allowing companies like Verizon and Comcast to sell internet browsing histories and other personal data to advertisers without permission.
1.8.6.4. Con: Such legislation is unlikely to address the privacy concerns of every user. And the fact that the legislation is being created supports the underlying concern that current practices are an invasion of privacy.
1.8.7. Pro: The browser is the users' private space and they have the right to dictate the way in which they experience that environment.
1.8.7.1. Con: By this logic, newspaper, radio and television ads are equally unacceptable as they invade the private space of users, may it be their living room or their car.
1.8.7.2. Con: Ethics go beyond rights. As an example, a person has a right to decline to report a colleague for defrauding other people, but to ignore it would still be unethical.
1.8.7.3. Con: The web browser is anything BUT a private place. It is the portal through which you interact with the rest of the internet, a public forum by definition.  For privacy, remain offline.
1.8.8. Pro: According to a [survey](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers), 91% of respondents think that ads are more intrusive today than they were 2-3 years ago and 79% feel like they are being tracked by retargeted ads.
1.8.8.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.1.
1.8.8.2. Con: According to another [survey](https://research.hubspot.com/charts/people-use-ad-blockers-because-ads-are-annoying) on the same page, only 39% of respondents identified "security concerns" and 32% identified "privacy concerns" as motivators to use ad-blocking software.
1.8.8.2.1. Con: While this is true, the primary concern cited was that ads were both annoying and [intrusive](https://research.hubspot.com/reports/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers) \(64%\).
1.8.9. Pro: The obscure legalese in privacy policies makes sites untrustworthy.
1.8.9.1. Con: Just because a person does not understand the legal policies does not make them less valid or the websites less trustworthy.
1.8.10. Pro: Nowadays browsers data and fingerprints are synchronised or tracked across the devices. Using a private account in a professional environment could potentially show some inappropriate ads based on private browsing history.
1.8.10.1. Con: Professional regulations do not allow to use private accounts in the work environments. This is not an expected or appropriate behaviour. It is a sole responsibility of a person who engages in this.
1.8.11. Con: When companies use your data to show personalised ads, all that changes is which ad shows up on your screen. It is not the case that others can see your personal data just because the companies show personalised ads and it won't have any impact on your life.
1.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.3.4.
1.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.
1.11. Con: -> See 1.2.2.3.1.1.
1.12. Con: There are analogous practices on all other forms of media that are not considered unethical. Ad blocking is no different.
1.12.1. Con: Online services are unique in that they tend to rely solely on ad revenue to support themselves financially. Reducing that source of revenue is therefore more significantly damaging to them than it is with other types of commercial entities.
1.12.2. Con: Using ad-blockers while accessing online content could be seen as analogous to downloading music or TV shows without paying for them, which is viewed as highly unethical.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Both of these practices prevent publishers and/or artists from monetizing the work that they have created.
1.12.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.12.2.2. Con: Downloading paid content for free is illegal, while downloading an ad-blocker to circumvent advertisements is not; therefore these concepts are not analogous.
1.12.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.12.2.3. Con: Not everyone considers illegal downloading to be unethical. Many people [believe](http://theconversation.com/is-downloading-really-stealing-the-ethics-of-digital-piracy-39930) that intellectual property unfairly restricts access to ideas and expression, and consider illegal downloading to be a victimless crime that imposes no significant cost on anyone.
1.12.2.3.1. Pro: Similarly, one could argue that using ad-blockers is victimless since they also impose no significant cost.
1.12.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.12.2.3.1.2. Pro: While common theft is zero-sum, blocking advertisements or downloading a digital file [is not](http://theconversation.com/is-downloading-really-stealing-the-ethics-of-digital-piracy-39930) because doing so does not exclude anyone else from its use or their ability to benefit from it. It merely means that the user has circumvented the owner's ability to exclude them from its use.
1.12.2.3.1.3. Pro: The absence of an ad-blocker does not necessarily mean that a user would spend money on advertised goods/services that they see online, therefore running an ad-blocker would likely lead to no financial loss.
1.12.2.3.1.4. Con: Ad-blockers may not cause any tangible damage yet they prevent content providers from incurring benefits. Thus, at the end of the day, they still do harm.
1.12.2.3.2. Con: Profit is necessary to incentivize creators to make products for public consumption.
1.12.2.3.2.1. Pro: If people cannot benefit from the distribution of their own products, then they have little reason to invest the time and resources and would likely cease production.
1.12.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.12.2.3.4. Con: One of the reasons people consider illegally downloading music to be acceptable is because artists still make a lot of money through endorsements, stage performances, etc. Unlike artists, most internet companies depend on advertising revenue to keep running.
1.12.2.3.5. Con: An [analysis](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/why-does-the-riaa-hate-torrent-sites-so-much/) by the Institute for Policy Innovation found that global music piracy results in $12.5 billion lost annually, 71,060 U.S. jobs lost, a loss of $2.7 billion in workers’ earnings, and a loss of $422 million in tax revenues. So clearly this practice imposes a significant cost on many people.
1.12.2.3.6. Con: This logic works as long as not everyone subscribes to it. As soon as everyone acts according to this logic, there would be zero funding for content providers. Those who act based on this logic thus elevate themselves above others.
1.12.3. Pro: Most video advertisements have an option to skip the ad after a few seconds, before any important information has been revealed.
1.12.3.1. Con: This is a flawed comparison. Whereas the option to skip video ads is provided by the site that shows these ads, which implies that skipping them is not considered problematic, ad-blockers provide an external solution that most likely is not appreciated by those running websites.
1.12.4. Con: Analogous practices on all other forms of media cannot be assumed to be any more or less ethical than this practice.
1.12.5. Pro: Using an ad-blocker would be like having a robot that automatically flipped through a magazine and cut out all ads before the user read the magazine. There is nothing necessarily unethical about this analogy, therefore there is nothing unethical about ad-blocking online.
1.12.6. Pro: Changing the channel on a TV, modulating the frequency of a radio, ignoring a billboard or flipping to the next page of a magazine achieve the exact same results as ad block software. Yet these activities are seen as perfectly normal things to do.
1.12.6.1. Con: Simply ignoring billboards and other forms of advertisement can hardly be compared to the use of adblockers; it rather compares to ignoring the advertisements displayed on websites without actively blocking them.
1.12.6.1.1. Con: Ignoring advertisements and blocking them both have the same ultimate effect \(the advertisement goes to waste\), so there is no moral distinction between the two.
1.12.6.1.1.1. Pro: The [financial cost to the advertiser is the same](https://www.webpagefx.com/internet-marketing/do-blocked-ads-count-toward-ppc.html) whether an advert is blocked or ignored.
1.12.6.1.1.2. Con: From the perspective of the platform that shows advertisement, the effects are quite distinct: in one case, advertisement is displayed, in the other it is not and thus cannot bring in revenue.
1.12.6.1.1.3. Con: In the case of many advertising platforms, ad impressions also generate revenue, not only click-through actions.
1.12.6.2. Con: Changing the channel or station on TV and radio removes the content as well as the ad.
1.12.6.3. Pro: Ads in other forms of media can be avoided by users without third party help. Ad blocks just help users achieve what they already do by themselves in all other forms of media.
