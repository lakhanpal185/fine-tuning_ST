Discussion Title: Should sensitive social and political topics be discussed in school?

1. Sensitive social and political topics should be discussed in school.
1.1. Pro: Educating kids at a younger age could improve apathy towards politics at a later stage.
1.1.1. Con: Political apathy may be the result of political incompetency and bad political praxis. The school system should not carry that burden.
1.1.2. Pro: Understanding better how political institutions work is essential for a well-funcionnig democracy and it is in the interest of every citizen.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The [EU](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/education-or-indoctrination-eu-goes-to-school-to-get-message-out-1.2609547) has approved a resolution to [improve](https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/parliament-approves-report-teaching-eu-schools) education about how the union works in order to "bridge the long-standing gap between the European Union and its citizens and to restore their faith in the merits and necessity of the European integration process".
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Some politicians, especially in the UK, consider this proposal to [interfere](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/08/eu-trying-to-introduce-mandatory-classes-about-the-bloc-into-sch/) with in each countries' sovereignty regarding education.
1.2. Con: Most schools are government-run, which makes really questioning the government in that setting too difficult.
1.2.1. Con: By this logic the constitution should not be taught in school, as it was designed to limit governmental powers, and provide methods to question itself. e.g. checks and balances between state and federal judiciary systems.
1.2.2. Con: The topic is not solely about questioning government. "Sensitive social and political topics" has to include questioning those who question the government without facts or logic.
1.2.3. Con: The questioning of the government would happen in the classroom, with teachers. Teachers, while they may technically be government employees, are sufficiently removed from administrative bodies to not preclude questioning the government in this setting.
1.2.4. Con: Constitution protections can prevent deterrence of such questioning and remedy the situation on the rare occasion such questioning is discouraged.
1.3. Pro: Politics should be discussed in schools because it is important for students to have a complex understanding of the world to properly navigate it as adults.
1.3.1. Pro: Students should have an understanding about how the government works and how to cope with it.
1.4. Con: Politics shouldn't be discussed in schools because teachers may bias their students.
1.4.1. Con: Ideally, the role of a teacher would be to motivate students to debate among themselves and form their own opinions without any input from the teacher whatsoever.
1.4.2. Con: Students will be more vulnerable to bias if they are not educated in politics. Civics education is important.
1.4.3. Pro: Teachers are regarded as an authority on the subjects that they teach, especially by younger pupils. As such, views supported by teachers could be seen as more valid by the pupils, thereby clouding their judgement.
1.4.4. Con: Teachers can be held to be open about their own political bias and be required to remind students that they are allowed to disagree and when the teacher is leaving the realm of purely factual information and delving into their own opinion. This would also help students recognize bias outside of the classroom.
1.4.5. Con: It is against the law for teacher to talk about their religion or their political opinion to their students.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Under the anti-establishment clause of the [1st Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) of the U.S. Constitution restricts teachers regarding personal religious opinion in the school environment.
1.4.5.2. Pro: In the UK Education Act of 1996 prohibits [political indoctrination](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/56/section/406).
1.5. Pro: Critical thinking, forming arguments, and exploring new topics should be a central pillar to an education system.  All of these things are rooted in discussions around sensitive and political topics.
1.6. Con: Some topics such as class, race, and gender can be too sensitive to talk to students about.
1.6.1. Con: Sensitive topics must be taught to students, or else they form a false impression of the world as a place where "these things" do not occur.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Students will be unprepared to analyze and interpret events if they are taught to ignore them in public settings like school.
1.6.2. Con: Schools are a safe environment, where students affected by discussions of sensitive topics can receive support if necessary.
1.6.2.1. Con: Schools have frequently employed paedophile teachers who could use topics based on sex to open inappropriate conversations with children in order to groom them.
1.6.3. Con: Given that adults not in school are often reluctant to discuss these topics, and that these topics continue to be important in today's world, students should discuss these topics in school so that we no do not continue to produce adults unwilling to honestly address important issues.
1.6.4. Pro: Children may not have the emotional or intellectual maturity to deal with some complex and nuanced topics.
1.6.4.1. Con: Arguably, many adults also lack this ability.
1.6.5. Pro: There are some obvious limits, extreme topics such as Bestiality and Necrophilia are examples which are too sensitive to be talked about at a primary \(and probably secondary\) school age.
1.6.6. Con: The majority of sensitive topics can be taught sensibly to reduce any damage to the children.
1.6.6.1. Pro: An example in the UK is Sexual education, which is taught only after a certain age is reached, with parental consent, and at a level appropriate for that age range.
1.6.7. Pro: Teaching topics on race can actually entrench racial stereotypes, biases and racism which would not develop naturally in the playground, because they are based on historical rather than current social events. Racism can develop from being told about another culture, not just from personal experience.
1.6.7.1. Con: This exposure to racist ideas can be regulated and controlled in schools, whereas in the media children will be exposed to the same ideas in an unregulated manner anyway.
1.6.7.1.1. Pro: The new internet connected world means that children are increasingly exposed to all kinda of ideas. Child \(age 3-15\) internet user has almost doubled \([UK OFCOM - Pg25](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/108182/children-parents-media-use-attitudes-2017.pdf)\) which brings increased exposure to racist ideas.
1.6.7.1.2. Pro: National Geographic [writes](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/04/from-the-editor-race-racism-history/) that "Americans got ideas about the world from Tarzan movies and crude racist caricatures”. “Segregation was the way it was. National Geographic wasn’t teaching as much as reinforcing messages they already received \[...\] with tremendous authority." If a major magazine which was intended to teach about other races admits it inadvertently entrenches racial stereotypes, than other media is very likely to have been doing so also.
1.6.8. Con: Students experience many of these topics which people do not want to teach about them about first hand.
1.7. Pro: Young people should have the opportunity to discuss issues that are important to them in a respectful, ordered environment.
1.8. Pro: School may be the only place students meet people with experiences and concerns vastly different to their own. Families and other social groupings are often little more than echo chambers for ideas that a student has grown up with. Discussions at school present young people with personal perspectives beyond those of family, friends and their religious congregations.
1.9. Pro: Students should be provided with discussion and facts before they decide on a particular view that they may hold for the rest of their life.
1.9.1. Pro: [Most kids](http://news.gallup.com/poll/14515/teens-stay-true-parents-political-perspectives.aspx) are likely to simply take on their parents' political views. Learning about it in school makes it possible for the children to make their own minds up.
1.9.2. Pro: Teachers supervising debates can ensure that students support their arguments with evidence, leading to a more productive discussion of ideas than the students might find elsewhere.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Discussing sensitive issues such as religion or politics in school may lead to less radicalization among the youth.
1.9.3. Con: People's views change as and when they meet new people, travel to new places and have new experiences. There is no reason to believe that people decide on their views while in school and stick to them forever.
1.9.3.1. Con: The parent does not argue that people decide their views and stick to them forever; rather, it argues that people should receive facts and be embroiled in discussion before they decide their views, which they might keep for all of their life.
1.10. Con: Parents may not want their child to discuss sensitive topics in school.
1.10.1. Con: The public school system guarantees that a child's education is completely independent from their parents.
1.10.2. Con: The child parents can take their children to another school if they don't like the way the school deals with politics issues.
1.10.2.1. Con: If part of a national curriculum, parents may have very few or no other options.
1.10.3. Pro: Parents in many countries have the option of removing their children from classes that teach things they do not agree with or are given the option to sign up or sign out their children from some subjects.
1.10.3.1. Pro: In the UK parents can partially opt their children out from [Sex Education until age 16](https://humanism.org.uk/2018/07/19/uk-government-moves-to-give-young-people-right-over-sex-education-opt-out/), and [Religious Education until age 18](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/other-compulsory-subjects). This could be easily extended to other sensitive topics.
1.10.3.1.1. Con: Ministers in the UK have [declared it 'unlawful'](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/sex-education-classes-compulsory-parents-right-withdraw-children-laura-bates-justine-greening-sre-a7607981.html) for parents to remove their children from sex education classes.
1.10.3.1.1.1. Con: A recent move in the UK to make sex education compulsory stipulated that parents [still have the right](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/03/01/sex-education-will-compulsory-schools-combat-sexting-cyber-bullying/) to remove their children from these classes.
1.10.3.1.2. Con: Human rights bodies, lawmakers, and campaigners are [moving to remove this](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/sex-education-classes-compulsory-parents-right-withdraw-children-laura-bates-justine-greening-sre-a7607981.html) due to it being “no longer consistent” with English case law and not consistent with the [EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights) and [UN](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx) Human Rights laws.
1.10.3.2. Con: The ability of parents to remove their children from classes that teach subjects and information with which they do not agree with is far from widespread.
1.10.3.2.1. Pro: The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe  have [condemned](http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=11751&lang=en) creationism in education, regarding it as an attack on two fundamental European principals: the separation of church and state and the freedom of education.
1.10.3.2.1.1. Pro: To ensure religious freedom and freedom of education, European countries offer the teaching of religious facts in other subjects \(France\); non-confessional religious education \(England, Sweden\); optional confessional religious education \(Spain, Netherlands\), or, when mandatory, the possibility to opt out \(Romania\) [\(Pépin, p. 20\)](http://www.nef-europe.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Teaching-about-religion_NEF-RelDem-RELIGION-EDUCATION-Final.pdf).
1.10.3.2.2. Pro: [Biology](http://ecs.force.com/mbdata/mbprofall?Rep=HS01) is a requirement to graduate high school in the United States.
1.10.3.2.3. Pro: In the UK, teachers are forced to teach Darwin's [theory of evolution](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9713524/Free-schools-forced-to-teach-evolution-in-science-classes.html), regardless of whether they believe in it.
1.10.3.2.4. Pro: In the US, the number of public schools which offer [creationism](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/01/creationism_in_public_schools_mapped_where_tax_money_supports_alternatives.html) as an alternative for biology is small.
1.10.3.3. Pro: The teaching of [creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_and_evolution_in_public_education_in_the_United_States#Recent_developments_in_state_education_programs), as opposed to the theory of evolution, has been a contentious issue in the US, subject to a wide number of litigations, including rulings by the Supreme Court. Presently, some states still allow public schools to opt out of teaching evolution.
1.10.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.10.3.2.4.
1.10.3.3.2. Pro: Eight US states have passed [bills](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-states-texas-creationism-science-teacher-state-law-evolution-religion-a7632931.html) \(or are creating them\) to legally protect teachers who want to teach creationism as a scientific theory.
1.10.3.4. Pro: [Australia](https://theconversation.com/religious-classes-in-schools-must-adapt-to-fit-a-changing-australia-81484) offers religion classes and, depending on the state, children can opt-out or opt-in of them.
1.10.3.4.1. Con: However, many organisations and parents complain that children are not given proper [alternatives](http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/10/22/3615647.htm) and are therefore ‘forced’ to attend religious classes, often imparted by Scripture teachers that promote [indoctrination](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/creationism-creeps-into-nsw-schools/news-story/96cf10dc8b8b65b27953fa1e491c2d1c?nk=c82afeaf02f0d9b19f1bac4996402d0c-1510580078).
