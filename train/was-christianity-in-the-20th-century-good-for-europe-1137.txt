Discussion Title: Was Christianity in the 20th Century Good for Europe?

1. The net contribution of Christianity to the improvement of Europeans' quality of life during the 20th century was positive.
1.1. Pro: Christian buildings were a net positive factor.
1.1.1. Con: Much investment had to be directed to the reconstruction of churches after WWII. This diverted urgently needed funds.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Repairs for major churches, such as the [Cologne Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_Cathedral#World_War_II_and_post-war_history), were finished quite early after WWII.
1.1.1.2. Con: Many churches, such as the [St. Nicholaus Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Nicholas%27_Church,_Hamburg#After_World_War_II) in Hamburg or the [Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Wilhelm_Memorial_Church), have never been repaired.
1.1.1.3. Con: During WWII [Strasbourg Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg_Cathedral#Later_history) \(Cathedral of Our Lady of Strasbourg\) was hit by British and American bombs during air raids on Strasbourg's center on 11 August 1944, which also heavily damaged the Sainte-Madeleine Church. Repairs to war damage were completed only in the early 1990s.
1.1.2. Pro: Christian buildings and pieces of art attracted tourists, which was beneficial for the economy.
1.1.2.1. Con: The resources spent on constructing Christian buildings could just as well have been used to build huge libraries and museums, which would attract just as many visitors, if not more.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Most churches were built before the 20th century.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Christian buildings and pieces of art contributed to the creation of UNESCO heritage in Europe and therewith benefited Europe's economy.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Many Christian buildings and related performances are today considered art. Quite a few of them are even on the list of UNESCO world heritage [sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_World_Heritage_Sites_by_country) in Europe.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The [Bourges Cathedral](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/635), the [Chartres Cathedral](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/81) and the [Amiens Cathedral](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/162) \(among others\) are world heritage sites in France.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Without churches [carillon music](http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/BSP/safeguarding-the-carillon-culture-preservation-transmission-exchange-and-awareness-raising-01017) could not emerge because not many bells would have been made. Today carillon is internationally recognised as UNESCO heritage.
1.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: The worship of saints has created the '[Limousin septennial ostensions](http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/limousin-septennial-ostensions-00885)' which is listed as UNESCO heritage.
1.1.2.2.1.4. Pro: The ritual of '[Colinat](http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/mens-group-colindat-christmas-time-ritual-00865)' is closely linked to Christmas.
1.1.2.2.1.5. Pro: [Catholic rituals](http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/celebrations-of-big-shoulder-borne-processional-structures-00721) evolved into 'celebrations of big shoulder-borne processional structures' which ranks as UNESCO World Heritage.
1.1.2.2.1.6. Pro: The [Tournai Cathedral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournai_Cathedral) \(Notre-Dame de Tournai\) in Belgium is a world heritage site since 2000.
1.1.2.2.1.7. Pro: The [Roskilde Cathedral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roskilde_Cathedral) in Denmark is a world heritage site since 1995.

1.1.2.2.2. Pro: [UNESCO designation](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/handle/1974/12246/Amayu_Ermias_A_201406_MPl.pdf;jsessionid=0AFCF665A89CCEDA09A215918D729965?sequence=1) leads cultural and craft goods to transform into [mass produced](http://matadornetwork.com/change/the-cultural-impacts-of-tourism-does-the-unesco-intangibles-program-help-or-hinder/) tourist items. These are better for the national economy.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: UNESCO designation in [established tourist destinations](http://www.ub.edu/aqr/anterior/workshop2014/?download=9.cuccia_guccio_rizzo_workshop AQR-IREA.pdf) leads to reduced repeated tourism because tourists come with too high expectations.
1.1.3. Pro: Christian buildings have improved towns and cities across the continent by making them more beautiful.
1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.
1.1.3.2. Con: Beauty is subjective; not everyone likes how a church looks.
1.1.4. Pro: Christian buildings fulfilled important functions.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Churches, monasteries and nunneries offer a welcoming and open place of quiet away from everyday day that can be used for contemplation and meditation.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: People could equally use spaces provided by other religions for mediation and contemplation, these spaces would've existed even without Christianity.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Before World War II, there were 17,000 synagogues [across Europe](https://www.jta.org/2018/02/09/news-opinion/world/british-foundation-for-preserving-jewish-heritage-unveils-map-of-europes-synagogues).
1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Europe already had a [sizeable number of mosques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mosques_in_Europe) in the 20th century.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Given the church's rejection of many societal groups, many people are unlikely to find the piece and quiet or feel welcome in a Christian building.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: The Catholic church rejected increasingly widespread practices such as [abortion and contraception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_the_20th_century#Sexuality_and_gender_issues), making people who had used these services feel unwelcome.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Churches and monasteries functioned as symbols of peace in communities.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: The Clonard monastery located at the borderlines of religious and Protestant faith in Northern Ireland became a symbol of [reconciliation](http://clonard.com/peace-and-reconciliation/).
1.1.4.2.3. Con: In many places, churches were a symbol of oppression rather than peace.
1.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Christian institutions acted as the "[religious arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_colonialism)" of colonial powers across the world.
1.1.4.2.3.2. Pro: In South East Asia, Christian missionary work and colonialism were so closely intertwined that they could [hardly be distinguished](http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199329069.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199329069-e-014).
1.1.4.2.3.3. Con: Russia liberated the Finnish from Swedish domination and formed the predecessor to modern Finland. Thus the churches were signaling the advent of [freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Finland); not oppression.
1.1.4.3. Pro: In late 20th century Germany, Church [sanctuary](https://www.kirchenasyl.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Church-asylum-in-Germany1.pdf) was beneficial for refugees, who were able to seek refuge in church buildings.
1.2. Pro: Christian customs were a net positive factor.
1.2.1. Con: Celibacy has negative psychological effects on priests.
1.2.1.1. Con: Child abuse rates among priests and average population are [equal](http://www.newsweek.com/priests-commit-no-more-abuse-other-males-70625); thus child abuse is no result of the celibacy.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The reported incidents of sexual abuses by priests in the US [declined](http://net-abbey.org/media-report-priest-abuse-not.htm) in recent decades.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Sexual abuse in public [schools](http://www.bbc.com/news/education-34138287) in the UK is widespread.
1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Child abuse is widespread among priests across different [denominations](http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0405/p01s01-ussc.html). This means that celibacy cannot have decisive effect.
1.2.1.2. Con: Monks and Nuns [live longer](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/want-to-live-longer-be-a-monk-5360664.html).
1.2.1.3. Pro: There were many cases of sexual [abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases) within the Catholic church.
1.2.1.3.1. Con: There are also a lot of cases of sexual abuse in secular facilities. Abuses are therefore the result of universal social processes and not related to the Church [\(p.7\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=ko&lr=&id=5CcXgmzHmcAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=power+and+abuse&ots=maleXYLNEp&sig=-P6UGfo6JJ26B8pbfwIExEqNTWo#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Priests' [victims](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2010/mar/11/catholic-abuse-priests) are generally boys which is not following the general pattern of society where often girls are the victims.
1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: [Statistics](http://www.naasca.org/2012-Resources/010812-StaisticsOfChildAbuse.htm) show that nearly 50% of child abuse victims are boys.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Parents gave their children to Catholic priests with a deep trust.
1.2.1.3.2. Con: 90% of Catholic priests have never abused children [\(p.7\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=ko&lr=&id=5CcXgmzHmcAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=power+and+abuse&ots=maleXYLNEp&sig=-P6UGfo6JJ26B8pbfwIExEqNTWo#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.2.1.3.3. Pro: The strange relationship of the Church with sex and the human body is contributing to child abuse because it is stultifying psychological growth [\(p.10\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=ko&lr=&id=5CcXgmzHmcAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=power+and+abuse&ots=maleXYLNEp&sig=-P6UGfo6JJ26B8pbfwIExEqNTWo#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.2.1.3.4. Pro: The Catholic Church tries to cover up scandals. This makes the victims feel the abuse again and allows for perpetrators to hit again [\(p.10\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=ko&lr=&id=5CcXgmzHmcAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=power+and+abuse&ots=maleXYLNEp&sig=-P6UGfo6JJ26B8pbfwIExEqNTWo#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.2.1.3.4.1. Pro: Most Bishops are old and were socialized in times when sex abuse was not to be mentioned. This mindset causes them to keep bonds with abusing priests [\(p.12\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=ko&lr=&id=5CcXgmzHmcAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=power+and+abuse&ots=maleXYLNEp&sig=-P6UGfo6JJ26B8pbfwIExEqNTWo#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.2.1.3.4.2. Pro: Many priests remain silent about the misconduct of their fellow priests in a spirit of solidarity [\(p.14\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?hl=ko&lr=&id=5CcXgmzHmcAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=power+and+abuse&ots=maleXYLNEp&sig=-P6UGfo6JJ26B8pbfwIExEqNTWo#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.2.1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.2.1.4. Con: Renouncing the complications of worldly desires, like sex, enriches spiritual contemplation and therefore creates a stable personality.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: Sexual relationships do not necessarily preclude spirituality and peace of mind.
1.2.1.4.2. Con: Suppressed sexuality has negative consequences.
1.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: [Sigmund Freud](http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/biography-sigmund-freud/597.aspx) was deeply convinced that sexual repression is one of mankind's main psychological problems.
1.2.1.4.2.1.1. Con: According to Freud, sexual desire is a part of the [identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Id) - the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends, which is the source of our bodily needs, wants, sexual and aggressive drives. As the id is unconscious, it means we cannot control it and sexual desire, therefore it should be avoided in order to keep public order.
1.2.1.4.2.2. Pro: There is no reason sexual desires should be suppressed.
1.2.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Sexual desire is very human in both females and males.
1.2.1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Sexual practices are joyful and mentally rewarding. This helps to create a more stable society.
1.2.1.4.2.2.3. Pro: Sex is a natural preventive of depression.
1.2.1.4.2.2.3.1. Pro: [Semen](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1015257004839) provides mood-enhancing hormones therewith tackling the source of depression for women.
1.2.1.4.2.2.3.2. Pro: Depression [reduces](http://www.everydayhealth.com/depression/depression-and-your-sex-life.aspx) sexual drive by disturbing the chemical balance in the brain. Keeping this balance by having sex prevents depression.
1.2.1.4.2.2.3.3. Con: If you are fighting a real depression, the desire to have sex is very low anyway. The benefit of having sex for the patient is not very likely to happen.
1.2.1.4.2.2.4. Pro: Sex helps you to sleep better.
1.2.1.4.2.2.5. Pro: Sex has the same effect on your body like [physical training](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/10553406/Sex-as-good-as-sport-for-burning-calories.html).
1.2.1.4.2.2.6. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.2.1.1.
1.2.1.4.2.2.7. Con: Sexual desires of pedophiles should be avoided / repressed. And women can have pedophile tendencies as well.
1.2.1.4.2.2.7.1. Pro: Children are the most unprotected members of society, thus they need special protection, even if it implies strict measures for paedophiles.
1.2.1.4.2.2.7.1.1. Pro: In some countries convicted paedophiles are forced to undergo chemical castration.
1.2.1.4.2.2.7.1.1.1. Pro: [South Korea](http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-58423020110724) approved such law.
1.2.1.4.2.2.7.1.1.2. Pro: [Poland](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10269055) also approved such law with the strong participation of Prime Minister Donald Tusk.
1.2.1.4.2.2.7.1.1.3. Pro: On April 30th 2010, a man in the U.K., who was found guilty of attempting to murder a 60-year-old woman in order to abduct and rape her two granddaughters, agreed to undergo chemical [castration](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/north_east/8636891.stm) as part of the terms of his sentence.
1.2.1.4.2.2.7.1.1.4. Pro: On March 6, 2012, Moldova legislated forcible chemical [castration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration#cite_note-32) of child molesters; the law came into effect on July 1, 2012.
1.2.1.4.2.2.7.1.1.5. Con: Human rights groups [object](http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-58423020110724) to chemical castration.
1.2.1.4.2.2.7.2. Pro: Children are our future, so we need to try our best in protecting them from abuse.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8. Con: Sexual desires should be suppressed in order to prevent someone from committing adultery.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1. Pro: Adultery is a danger to stable society.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.1. Con: A stable society in terms of a stable economy or politics would not be threatened by a polygamous way of living of its citizens.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.1.1. Pro: There are tribes in Africa, where a wife generally considers it an economic advantage for her family to have additional co-wives, since the women help each other in doing domestic chores and in caring for their animals. Thus stability is granted.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.2. Pro: It will leave families with deep wounds if a partner commits adultery. Happy citizens are better for a stable society than unhappy citizens.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.2.1. Con: People can be happy in stable but so-called "open" relationships, where each partner is allowed to have other sexual partners, if he / she desires so.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.2.2. Con: People find new partners, it happens all the time.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.2.3. Con: You can be happy and without a partner.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.3. Pro: It not only opens a person up to diseases and curses such as HIV, but it also creates unholy soul ties \(spiritual bondage between one person and another\), which can cause unclean \(demonic\) bondages to transfer from one person to the other.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.4. Pro: It causes marriages to divorce, incurring costs to the public.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.4.1. Con: Some marriages would have ended way sooner, if the partners had not had affairs to keep the spice up.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.5. Con: This seems highly unlikely given that humans are adulterous, but there seem to be stable societies around the planet.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.5.1. Pro: Being adulterous is a standard human desire, to which many people succumb.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.5.1.1. Pro: Many relationships, especially after a long time have no regular sex anymore.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.5.1.2. Pro: A specific individual might just be an object of lust and desire and even though one has no intention of leaving ones partner, one will give in and have an affair.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.2. Con: Our society is not entirely monogamous anyway. It can better be described as sequential monogamy.
1.2.1.4.2.2.8.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.2.2.8.1.5.1.
1.2.1.4.2.3. Con: Suppressing sexuality that is harmful to others has positive consequences.
1.2.1.4.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.2.2.7.
1.2.1.4.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.2.2.8.
1.2.1.4.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.2.1.5. Pro: Many men see the celibacy as [escape](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/opinion/bruni-the-wages-of-celibacy.html?_r=1) from sexual desires where in fact there can be none. This causes a constant situation of stress.
1.2.1.6. Pro: Priests reportedly came out of the box to complain about the psychological effects celibacy has on their lives.
1.2.1.6.1. Pro: Priest [Richard Sipe](http://ncronline.org/blogs/examining-crisis/reality-celibate-life-reflections-henri-nouwen) noted the great loneliness, depression, and emotional distress.
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: Former priest [J. Cecil](http://liberalcatholiconcelibacy.blogspot.kr/) argued that the oath of celibacy might increase the likelihood of someone acting on preexisting sexual inclinations.
1.2.1.7. Pro: [NGOs](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/us/turning-to-a-support-group-to-deal-with-celibacy.html?_r=0) have been founded to support groups of priests to ease the stress of celibacy.
1.2.1.8. Pro: Suppressing sexual desires is a [great struggle](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/22/priests-in-panties.html) for many priests. This is a burden on their mental health.
1.2.1.8.1. Pro: Repression of sexual desire leads to an overall level of [aggression](http://www.insidershealth.com/article/should_you_give_celibacy_a_try_physical_and_psychological_effects_of_giving_up_sex/4498).
1.2.1.9. Con: Time invested in finding a possible partner is saved and can be used for other useful activities.
1.2.2. Con: The concept of Sunday as 7th day of the week where rest is needed leads to income losses in one day every week.
1.2.2.1. Con: It makes economic sense to have some days of recreation as they allow working people to replenish their energy reserves.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: On a [macroeconomic](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/17326/1/MPRA_paper_17326.pdf) level holidays seem to make no major impact.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Days off allow workers to keep social contacts which make life happier.
1.2.2.1.3. Pro: The concept of Sunday as 7th day of the week where rest is needed enables recovery from stressful workdays.
1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: The abolition of the concept of Sunday as 7th day of the week, where rest is needed, would not mean that there is no possibility to rest in the other days of the week.
1.2.2.1.3.2. Con: Christianity demands that day to go to church and thus fills this day with duties.
1.2.2.1.3.3. Con: Citizens are mature and self-responsible and therefore they should decide on their own if they need a day off.
1.2.2.1.3.3.1. Con: Planning of days off is essential for creating stable working procedures. Otherwise it would be unpredictable when who is missing at work.
1.2.2.1.3.4. Pro: Attempts to change the Georgian calendar proved futile because the Sunday offers an established day off.
1.2.2.1.3.4.1. Pro: The [French Republican Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_Calendar#Criticism_and_shortcomings) had a 10-day week and was extremely unpopular among workers since it reduced the number of resting days afforded to them.
1.2.2.1.3.4.2. Pro: The [Soviet Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_calendar) with its rotating rest day proved unproductive and was abolished.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Having a day off every week is not good for the economy.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Opening on Sundays will lead to additional congestion.
1.2.2.2.2. Con: Most small shops do not open on Sundays, which gives an unfair advantage to larger shops. This distorted competition is a market failure [\(p.9\)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/36765/easing_Sunday_shopping_restrictions_on_large_stores_in_England_and_Wales.pdf).
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: Internet [shops](https://www.mackinac.org/2783) and catalogs are allowed to sell on Sundays. Leveling the playing field for offline competitors helps the market.
1.2.2.2.4. Pro: Sunday trading increases the capacity of successful retailers and would result in an increase in productivity that leads to an overall income growth.
1.2.2.2.5. Pro: The productivity gain on Sunday's work leads to lower consumer prices [\(p.30\)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/36765/easing_Sunday_shopping_restrictions_on_large_stores_in_England_and_Wales.pdf).
1.2.2.2.5.1. Pro: In Sweden, a 10% increase in opening hours led to a 0.3% decrease in prices [\(p.32\)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/36765/easing_Sunday_shopping_restrictions_on_large_stores_in_England_and_Wales.pdf).
1.2.2.2.6. Con: Extra opening hours do not change the percentage of consumers' income invested, but only costs companies wages.
1.2.2.2.6.1. Con: Paying wages only goes at the cost of companies, but the workers who get the money will have more to spend and the government will have more tax income. Thus the economy as a whole gets a stimulation by extra opening days.
1.2.2.2.6.2. Pro: Comparing open Sundays areas with others shows that consumers do not make more shopping trips [\(p.33\)](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/36765/easing_Sunday_shopping_restrictions_on_large_stores_in_England_and_Wales.pdf). More hours to shop does not increase the amount of money most consumers have to spend.
1.2.2.2.6.2.1. Pro: Even though Scotland has open Sunday shopping consumers do not make more shopping trips than the [UK national average](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/36765/easing_Sunday_shopping_restrictions_on_large_stores_in_England_and_Wales.pdf).
1.2.3. Pro: Christian customs brought joy on a regular basis.
1.2.3.1. Con: In some German states it is forbidden to host [dance](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dancings-banned-over-easter-in-germany-10155681.html) events and concerts on certain holidays.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: The German dance scene is similar to dance scenes in other countries where it is allowed to host dance events on Easter. Thus, no major economic effect is visible.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The days, where it is forbidden to host such events in certain states, are located in between major general holidays. Thus the days where it is forbidden to host dance events are amidst those days, where it is most profitable to host such events. The effects are immediate, because there are at least 4 digit incomes in just one night at stake.
1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Good Friday is the start of a multi-day holiday.
1.2.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Halloween is the day before All Saints Day.
1.2.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: Remembrance Sunday is always on a Sunday.
1.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Dance scenes not only differ from country to country but even from city to city. The scene of Munich is a totally different one than Berlin's oder Hamburg's in terms of general musical taste, clubbing behavior, locations, etc.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: It is unclear whether the origins for these practices are to be found in religion or culture.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: These bans have existed in Germany since at least the [early 20th century](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzverbot#Geschichtlicher_Hintergrund).
1.2.3.1.4. Pro: Dance events and concerts contribute to the economy as food and beverages are generally consumed in large quantities, and tickets normally being required for attendance.
1.2.3.2. Con: A lot of people are stressed on festive days or their preparation.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Christian weddings come with many pleasures to the couple and the guests.
1.2.3.3.1. Pro: Church weddings are a nice, formal festivity where women can wear pretty white dresses.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Con: Wearing gendered clothing for weddings reaffirms power relations. Women wear a special cloth which main feature is to look good. Men wear essentially business attire.
1.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: The sale of wedding dresses, veils, tuxedos and such is a very lucrative economic branch all over Europe.
1.2.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: The average European couple spends around [5000€](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/europeans-prefer-to-have-modest-weddings-and-splurge-on-a-house-instead-2015-05-30) on their wedding.
1.2.3.3.1.3. Con: Getting married in a registry office is allowing for wearing pretty white dresses too. There is no need for a church.
1.2.3.3.1.4. Con: People really wanting to wear nice dresses, have all kinds of possibilities to do so, no wedding ceremony is needed to do so.
1.2.3.3.1.4.1. Pro: There is [a woman](http://www.bustle.com/articles/71837-wearing-a-wedding-dress-for-no-reason-made-me-feel-some-unexpected-feels) who did wear a wedding dress for no special occasion.
1.2.3.3.1.4.1.1. Con: Even this woman reported she felt very [awkward](http://www.bustle.com/articles/71837-wearing-a-wedding-dress-for-no-reason-made-me-feel-some-unexpected-feels) to do it so that she did not try it in her home country.
1.2.3.3.1.4.2. Con: People staring at you makes for an awkward feeling that effectively prevents people from wearing a wedding dress on other occasions.
1.2.3.3.1.4.3. Con: A wedding dress worn for normal occasion will [be ruined afterwards](http://www.bustle.com/articles/71837-wearing-a-wedding-dress-for-no-reason-made-me-feel-some-unexpected-feels). It needs a special occasion that makes it worth the money spent on the one time it is wearable.
1.2.3.3.1.5. Con: The last thing that is relevant when marrying in church are the outfits. Having the institution of marriage deteriorated into "fashion shows" is disrespectful towards the process, the institution and after all the religion itself.
1.2.3.3.2. Pro: Churches look sublime fitting well the occasion of the vow.
1.2.3.3.3. Con: Big family reunions like weddings can cause old clashes to resurface and thus not only cause happiness for all attendees.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: Often, family conflicts are kept from breaking out by simply avoiding each other. Weddings force people to face each other and can thus cause smoldering conflicts to erupt again.
1.2.3.3.3.2. Pro: People who cannot bear everyone's attention being on the couple might start new fights or fan the flames old conflicts to garner attention for themselves.
1.2.3.3.4. Pro: The sermons of priests are much more festive than sermons of a public official.
1.2.3.3.5. Con: Celebration of civil unions would likely have happened without Christianity, providing similar benefits.
1.2.3.4. Con: [Krampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus) is a dark character that regularly frightens young children during the festive season.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: The [Zwarte Piet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwarte_Piet) has the same function at the same day in the Netherlands and its origin is linked to Germanic mythology. This suggests there is no link to religion but that it is a social phenomenon.
1.2.3.4.1.1. Con: Zwarte Piets part as a [companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwarte_Piet) of Saint Nicholas directly links him to Christianity.
1.2.3.4.1.1.1. Con: The Zwarte Piet is more linked to [colored](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/05/black-pete-race-netherlands) people rather than to anything in Christianity, which works only as a cover up.
1.2.3.4.1.2. Pro: The origin of [Sinterklaas](http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/xmas/swartz/American%20Christmas%20Origins.htm) \(Saint Nicholas\) and his helpers has been linked by some experts to the Wild Hunt of Odin in [Germanic mythology](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28497?msg=welcome_stranger#ch2). Thus there is no original link to Christianity.
1.2.3.4.2. Con: The Krampus dates back to [pre-Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus#Origins) traditions and thus cannot be associated with Christianity.
1.2.3.4.2.1. Con: Krampus has to be associated with Christianity because it only appears during Christmas season as the [counterpart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus#Origins) to Saint Nicholas.
1.2.3.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.4.1.2.
1.2.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.3.

1.2.4.1. Pro: Christian customs were positive for the economy.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: The huge amount of Christian holidays leads to way too much off days. That means the economy suffers from days where almost nobody is working.
1.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: [Germany](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Feiertage_in_Deutschland.png) has up to 14 additional Holidays, from which all except three and New Year are based on religion.
1.2.4.1.3.2. Pro: [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Spain) has at least nine Holidays based on religion.
1.2.4.1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.6.
1.2.4.1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.2.4.1.3.5. Pro: Days off give chance to create a sense of community which is negative to economic success.
1.2.4.1.3.5.1. Pro: Feelings of community destroy insecurity, which is a main driver of capitalist desire [\(p.15\)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Ryan2/publication/232447683_Materialistic_values_Their_causes_and_consequences/links/54e7499f0cf2b199060adbc6.pdf).
1.2.4.1.4. Pro: Christian holidays, like Easter or Christmas, were often directly connected with high consumption and thus have a very positive influence on the economy.
1.2.4.1.4.1. Pro: [Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_Christmas) is typically a peak selling season for retailers in many nations around the world, which started off during the [1980's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_Christmas#Commencement).
1.2.4.2. Pro: Christian customs created passages of life that help to structure human's existence.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: The institution of marriage provided a lot of people with safety in their lives.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Con: Many people have suffered as a result of being trapped due to the institution of marriage.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Divorce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce#Secularisation_in_Europe) was incredibly difficult to attain in most parts of Europe until the 20th century.
1.2.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Many people have suffered from forced marriages throughout history.
1.2.4.2.2. Pro: Through baptism the children or baptized persons get a godfather who will accompany them in their life.
1.2.4.2.3. Pro: Christmas holidays and Easter holidays were very popular among young and old and provided a great opportunity for families to reunite for a festivity.
1.2.4.2.3.1. Con: Christmas is around the winter solstice and was celebrated differently, yet at the same time, across Europe [before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas#Relation_to_concurrent_celebrations) Christianity arrived. Thus, Christianity was not decisive.
1.2.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Christianity should be considered decisive in keeping the tradition alive given that it's been primarily celebrated as a Christian event.
1.2.4.2.3.2. Con: [Passover](http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/passover-2016/) is at the same time as Easter and much older. This indicates that Easter is just a copy and would have evolved without the influence of Christianity.
1.2.4.2.4. Con: [Structures of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_passage) exist irrespective of religion and are present in Christian and non-Christian societies alike. There is no special added value by Christianity.
1.2.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.2.4.4. Con: Christian customs led to the isolation of non-Christians at those occasions.
1.2.4.4.1. Pro: Some Muslim citizens in the UK kept children [away from school](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/letter-muslim-children-at-christmas-1564038.html) during December of 1992 to avoid them being 'drawn in' by Christmas.
1.2.4.4.2. Pro: Muslims in Europe are forced to choose between recognizing the importance of a holiday or ignoring it. This is a difficult choice for many who want to be firmly integrated while at the same time retain their religious beliefs [\(p.28\)](http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_36128-1522-2-30.pdf?131125102632).
1.2.4.5. Con: Most Christian customs are copies of other social habits or pre-Christian behavior. Thus, the festivities would have been there equally without Christianity.
1.2.4.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.4.2.
1.2.4.5.2. Pro: The concept of Sunday was present in [Norse mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday#Etymology) already. Thus, it would have evolved irrespective of Christianity.
1.2.4.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.3.1.
1.2.4.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.3.2.
1.2.4.6. Pro: During times of war Christian festivities and symbols gave hope and peace to the peoples of Europe.
1.2.4.6.1. Pro: Many war memorials for fallen soldiers, e.g here in [Romania](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Wye631xe-dQC&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=christian+holiday+during+world+war+i&source=bl&ots=yOrgwjx7tN&sig=NaxSxNa-ll5gvIYPv7wswzMAbTQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiMj5Kwq-rLAhXHo5QKHQifCesQ6AEIODAF#v=onepage&q=christian%20holiday%20during%20world%20war%20i&f=false), include Christian elements.
1.2.4.6.2. Pro: A short [truce](http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/christmas-truce-of-1914) was made at Christmas during World War I in 1914.

1.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: Nuns are more devoted to doing good than professional healthcare workers leading not only to mounting costs but also to a reduced service quality.
1.2.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: Nuns learn to be devote in their convent and through their lifestyle, as is shown by the life [stories](https://www.behance.net/gallery/16328701/Devotion-The-Life-of-a-Nun) of many nuns.
1.2.5.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Nuns are not automatically good and devoting as child abuse [scandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_scandal_in_the_Sisters_of_Mercy) show.
1.2.5.1.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.2.1.1.1.
1.2.5.1.3. Con: Altruism was declining in society during the 20th century.
1.2.5.1.3.1. Pro: Young people [volunteered](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nvsm.89/abstract) less often in British society during the late 20th century.
1.2.5.1.3.2. Pro: According to Stanley Milgram's thesis of ["urban overload"](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=XA8Ho_aITVoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Crowding+and+Behavior&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj12IbApprMAhVW2WMKHZepBAoQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&q=Crowding%20and%20Behavior&f=false), altruistic behaviour decreases as the share of the population living in cities increases.
1.2.5.1.4. Pro: In [Northern Ireland](http://www.gladysganiel.com/irish-catholic-church/religion-reconciliation-and-reconstruction-in-northern-ireland-some-initial-reflections/) it was the faith of individuals rather than the religious institution that worked for reconciliation.
1.2.5.1.4.1. Pro: The Corrymeela [Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrymeela_Community) was set up by Christian individuals to bridge the divide between the Northern Irish.
1.2.5.1.4.2. Pro: The Evangelical Contribution on Northern Ireland was founded in the 1960s to work against a mixing of politics and religion [\(p.65\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=6b6uAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=ireland+religious+reconciliation&source=bl&ots=Z8omkWlw8U&sig=Vl1F8AFbfODG10CYV0S61m41xDM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8hrHSgZbLAhWie6YKHbdLAzgQ6AEIOzAF#v=onepage&q=ireland%20religious%20reconciliation&f=false).
1.2.5.1.4.3. Pro: The Columbanus [Community](http://www.gladysganiel.com/irish-catholic-church/remembering-fr-michael-hurley-in-belfast/) was founded in the 1960s to promote interfaith reconciliation.
1.2.5.1.4.4. Pro: The Christian Renewal [Centre](http://www.christianrenewalcenter.org/) was founded in 1974 and aims at community measures for reconcilliation.
1.2.5.1.5. Con: [Altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism) \(selflessness\), as a principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others, is not an exclusively Christian doctrine.
1.2.5.1.5.1. Con: This does not mean that the Christian way of living did not contribute to increased practice of altruistic living.
1.2.5.1.5.2. Pro: [Social service and welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_humanity#Social_welfare_in_Islam) are some of the principal values of Islam.
1.2.5.1.5.3. Pro: Judaism has a strong emphasis on the [alleviation of poverty](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/chief-rabbi-lord-sacks/the-jewish-approach-to-welfare-and-unemployment_b_3110666.html).
1.2.5.2. Con: Charity is in no way an exclusively Christian thing.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: That does not mean that the Christian tradition of being charitable didn't contribute to the creation of many ideas of charity and welfare.
1.2.6. Pro: The Church asylum gives shelter to refugees who are protected nowhere else.
1.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.2.7. Pro: Catholics tend to oppose war and have strict [moral codes](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm) for when it is fought.
1.2.8. Pro: There's scientific evidence that Christianity [shaped people's behaviour](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/08/does-religion-influence-epidemics) and incentivises them to care for their sick.
1.3. Con: Christian institutions were harming the lives of Europeans.
1.3.1. Pro: The Catholic Church as a global organization is harmful to Europeans because of its backwardness.
1.3.1.1. Pro: The Catholic Church discriminates against women.

1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: Within the Church many high officials themselves [advocate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_contraception#Dissent) the use of contraceptives.

1.3.1.1.3.

1.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: These roles include professorships and administrators and thus are not only low-level positions [\(p.322\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ZBZNXBWqdgEC&pg=PA322&dq=%22Catholic+Church%22+lay+women&hl=en&ei=YE4LTvDMOcvbiAKq_-jjAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Catholic%20Church%22%20lay%20women&f=false).
1.3.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Religious institutes [focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_women#Religious_institutes_for_women) on scholastic work or nursing. These are not empowering professions for women.

1.3.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: [Ordination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination_of_women_in_Protestant_churches) of women has been taking place in an increasing number of Protestant churches during the 20th century.
1.3.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: The ordination of women in the [Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination_of_women_in_the_Anglican_Communion) Communion has been increasingly common in certain provinces since the 1970s.

1.3.1.1.6.1.4. Con: This does not subtract from the fact that women are discriminated against by not being able to get ordained.
1.3.1.1.7. Pro: Christianity [preaches](http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/topics/reform/documents/2006womenreproductiverightsandthecatholicchurch.asp) the subordination of women to men.
1.3.1.1.7.1. Con: The Catholic preaching of [New Feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_women#Current_status) stresses the complementary of both genders; not their subjugation.
1.3.1.1.7.1.1. Con: New Feminism was created by the Church to maintain the hierarchical system, as argued by Sister of Mercy Mary [Aquin O’Neill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_feminism#Critiques).
1.3.1.1.7.1.2. Con: The Catholic Church did not wholeheartedly [embrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_feminism#Critiques) New Feminism but occasionally sticks to the more traditional teachings of the 1912 Catholic Encyclopedia.
1.3.1.1.7.2. Pro: In [Eph. 5:24](http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-24.htm) it is taught that wives are inferior to their husbands and have to submit to them.
1.3.1.1.8. Pro: Popes discriminated women during the 20th century.
1.3.1.1.8.1. Pro: [Pope Pius XI](http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/topics/reform/documents/2006womenreproductiverightsandthecatholicchurch.asp) condemned women’s emancipation as undermining the divinely founded obedience of the wife to her husband and a false deflection from her true and sole role as mother and homemaker.
1.3.1.1.8.2. Pro: John Paul II personally worked against a more gender equal society.
1.3.1.1.8.2.1. Pro: Pope John Paul II cemented gender separation by declaring discussions of female ordination 'off limits' [\(p.322\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ZBZNXBWqdgEC&pg=PA322&dq=%22Catholic+Church%22+lay+women&hl=en&ei=YE4LTvDMOcvbiAKq_-jjAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Catholic%20Church%22%20lay%20women&f=false).
1.3.1.1.8.2.2. Pro: Pope John Paul II promoted the maternal role of women, either with children or in teaching others the faith. He said that women had a "[biological destiny](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/pope/johnpaulii_1.shtml)".
1.3.1.1.8.2.3. Con: Pope John Paul II stressed the need for women in the Catholic Church describing them as "[irreplaceable](https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/1994/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_19940522_ordinatio-sacerdotalis.html)".
1.3.1.1.9. Con: The Church does treat each sex differently, but this is not discrimination "against" one or "in favor" of the other. Instead, men and women have different roles in the Church that correspond to their differing natures. Because men and women have different gifts, it is fitting and natural for them to occupy different roles in the family, the Church, and the broader society.
1.3.1.1.10. Pro: Vatican City is currently the only country where only men have voting [rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Vatican_City).

1.3.1.2.1. Pro: The Harry Potter book [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_debates_over_the_Harry_Potter_series) is highly debated amongst church officials.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Fragmented opposition of churches did not reduce the popularity of Harry Potter.
1.3.1.2.2. Pro: The Catholic Church listed some of the world's most highly regarded authors like Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Honoré de Balzac on its [Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_authors_and_works_on_the_Index_Librorum_Prohibitorum) Librorum Prohibitorum.
1.3.1.2.3. Con: There is Christian [modern art](http://christianmodernart.com/).
1.3.1.3. Pro: The Christian Church has been, and still is, a strong opponent of science and technological, natural scientific advances.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: The Church only opposes biomedical advances and not science in general. This field is special given its societal contestation.
1.3.1.3.3. Con: Many people oppose these biotechnological advances and the Church is merely their agent. Thus it is not the Church to blame but those principals.
1.3.1.3.4. Pro: It took the church more than 350 years to say that [Galileo](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/world/after-350-years-vatican-says-galileo-was-right-it-moves.html) was right.
1.3.1.3.4.1. Con: A lack of self-reflection to acknowledge past wrongdoings is different from the ability to accept progress made.
1.3.1.3.5. Pro: The Church opposes embryonic stem cell [research](http://stemcellresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/usccb_2008-06-13.pdf) because it regards this as "deliberate killing of innocent human beings".
1.3.1.3.6. Con: The Church endorsed [vaccines](http://www.catholicsforchoice.org/news/inthenews/VaticanEthicsGuide.asp) that were developed using stem cell research methods.
1.3.1.3.7. Pro: The Church opposes cloning.
1.3.1.3.7.1. Con: The Vatican is not opposed to [cloning](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_academies/acdlife/documents/rc_pa_acdlife_doc_30091997_clon_en.html) in "the vegetable and animal kingdoms".
1.3.1.3.8. Pro: The Church opposes in vitro fertilization /  fertilization \([IVF](http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/1774/church_teaching_on_in_vitro_fertilization.aspx)\).
1.3.1.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.3.1.4. Con: Much of modern culture relates to the Church.
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: Books like, [The Da Vinci Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code) or [The Pillars of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillars_of_the_Earth), would not be possible without the existence of the Church.
1.3.1.4.2. Pro: The Church appears frequently as an actor in modern movies.
1.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: In the Hitchcock movie [I Confess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Confess_\(film\)) there is a catholic priest. Without the Church there could be no such a role.
1.3.1.4.2.2. Pro: [Shakespeare in Love](http://www.greatstbarts.com/Pages/Church/Photo%20Pages/Films/Shakespeare.html) plays partly in a church.
1.3.1.4.2.3. Pro: The movie '[Jude](http://www.greatstbarts.com/Pages/Church/Photo%20Pages/Films/Jude.html)' has film scenes that are in a Church.
1.3.1.4.2.4. Pro: [Four Weddings And A Funeral](http://www.greatstbarts.com/Pages/Church/Photo%20Pages/Films/4Weddings.html) was supported by a church in London for their shooting and featured in the movie.
1.3.1.5. Con: The Catholic Church's Councils act in a democratic fashion by majority voting.
1.3.1.5.1. Pro: [Nostra aetate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostra_aetate) was accepted by a vote of 2,221 to 88 of the assembled bishops showing that democratic systems are at work within the Church.
1.3.1.5.2. Con: Only a selected few at the upper class can vote. This is not in line with a modern understanding of democracy.
1.3.1.6. Pro: The Church is against [divorce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_divorce#Roman_Catholic_Church) and therewith makes people remain together against their wish.
1.3.1.6.1. Pro: Churches spread an atmosphere of [silence](http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2016/January/Combating-Domestic-Abuse-in-the-Church) that ignores the calls of women for help.
1.3.1.6.2. Pro: The Church encourages couples to stay together even after abuse occurred.
1.3.1.6.2.1. Pro: In the [manual](http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/marriage-and-family/marriage/domestic-violence/when-i-call-for-help.cfm) of the Catholic Bishops in the US they listed that, as a third step after securing the victim, and holding the abuser accountable, priests should work to restore the relationship.
1.3.1.6.3. Con: [Studies have shown](https://ifstudies.org/blog/for-kids-parental-cohabitation-and-marriage-are-not-interchangeable) that growing up in a family where a child's parents are married to each other is a predictor of success.
1.3.1.6.4. Con: Marriage serves as a stabilizing force economically and socially, and being able to easily dissolve that contract reduces this positive effect.
1.3.1.6.5. Pro: There were less than [2 divorces per 1000 people](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Marriage_and_divorce_statistics) in the EU by the end of the 20th century.
1.3.1.7. Pro: Christian views and policies based on those views led to the oppression of groups such as homosexuals, including Alan Turing, the man who worked against Nazi Germany and was later chemically castrated for being a homosexual.
1.3.1.8. Con: Backward is a subjective criterion that begs the question.
1.3.1.9. Pro: The progress that has been made to give homosexuals and homosexual couples equal rights in Europe is being [bitterly fought against](http://catholicherald.co.ukw008000007c4dww.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/09/03/pope-says-marriage-can-only-be-between-a-man-and-a-woman-and-we-cannot-change-it/) by the Church and its institutions.
1.3.1.9.1. Pro: Rigorous piety and professing homosexuality as "unholy" has led to discrimination against people oriented towards the same sex.
1.3.1.9.2. Pro: Homosexuals suffered under Christian doctrines, as the Church forbids homosexuality.
1.3.1.9.2.1. Con: The Church does not forbid homosexuality. It is the homosexual act, which is forbidden.
1.3.1.9.2.1.1. Con: As homosexuals will probably conduct the homosexual act they are being discriminated.
1.3.1.9.2.1.2. Pro: Cardinal [Ratzinger](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html), in a letter the pope approved, argued in 1986 that "the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin."
1.3.1.9.2.2. Pro: The Church clearly states that homosexuality is no acceptable [behavior](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html).
1.3.1.9.2.3. Pro: Homosexuals are the focus of intensive '[pastoral care](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html)' and therewith are continuously bothered.
1.3.1.9.2.4. Con: Homosexuals can live their sexual orientation as long as they produce kids through occasional heterosexual encounters because the Church only objects to homosexuality on grounds that it prevents men from living a 'natural' life.
1.3.1.9.2.4.1. Pro: The Church objects to homosexuality on grounds that it prevents men from using [God's creation](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html) of sexuality.
1.3.1.9.2.4.2. Con: Passages from the Old Testament as well as the New Testament state matters that most certainly apply to homosexuals, even if they were to produce children along the way.
1.3.1.9.2.4.2.1. Pro: [Leviticus 18:22](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Lev%2018.22) declares having sexual relations with the same sex to be an abomination.
1.3.1.9.2.4.2.2. Pro: [Romans 1:26-27](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%201.26-27) condemns sexual relations between the same sex as abandoning what is natural.
1.3.1.9.2.4.2.3. Pro: [First Corinthians 6:9](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Cor%206.9) states that homosexual offenders will not inherit the kingdom of God.
1.3.1.9.2.4.3. Con: If homosexuals are forced to produce children, they clearly cannot live their sexual orientation at all times.
1.3.1.9.2.4.4. Con: It is degrading to be forced into an occasional heterosexual relationship if the inner mind longs for homosexuality. The other way around would not be nice either.
1.3.1.9.2.5. Con: The Church works against verbal and physical [violence](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html) towards homosexuals.
1.3.1.9.2.5.1. Pro: The Church clearly spoke against criminalization of homosexuality at the [UN](http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/vatican_u.n._delegation_calls_for_end_to_unjust_discrimination_against_homosexuals/).
1.3.1.9.2.6. Con: Homosexuals are not banned but only called upon to live a "[chaste live](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html)".
1.3.1.9.2.6.1. Con: Demanding chastity is a constraint on a person's life and freedom of action.
1.3.1.9.2.6.1.1. Con: They are not demanded but called upon, which leaves considerable more leeway in interpretation.
1.3.1.9.2.7. Pro: Homosexuals in the 20th century were prevented in many European countries to marry because of Christian traditions, which clearly [oppose](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20030731_homosexual-unions_en.html) it.
1.3.1.9.2.8. Pro: Christian opposition to [child adoption](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20030731_homosexual-unions_en.html) of same-sex couples presents an obstacle for homosexuals' rights.
1.3.1.9.2.9. Con: There are parts of the [clergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_Roman_Catholicism#Clergy) that are homosexual themselves. Apparently the two are not mutually exclusive.
1.3.1.9.2.9.1. Pro: [Robert Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Carter_\(priest\)) was one of the first priest in the 1970s to come out. Many more [followed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_Roman_Catholicism#Clergy).
1.3.1.9.2.9.2. Pro: There is a Vatican '[gay lobby](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22869399)'.
1.3.1.9.2.9.3. Pro: There were '[boot camps](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/gay-priest-reveals-secret-of-catholic-boot-camp-1247443.html)' used by the church to treat alcoholic, gay and paedophiliac clergymen.
1.3.1.9.2.9.4. Pro: An Irish priest died in a '[gay club](http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/19th-november-1994/26/irish-priests-death-in-gay-club-the-archbishop-of-)' and the cardinal expressed his condolences.
1.3.1.9.2.10. Con: The [impact](http://univision.data4.mx/resultados_catolicos/eng/ENG_catholic-survey.pdf) of Church doctrines on homosexuality differs in Spain, Italy and Poland even though the role of the Church is equally strong. Thus, the impact of the Church is limited.
1.3.1.9.2.11. Pro: In 2014 the [United Nation's Committee on the Rights of the Child](http://ncronline.org/news/accountability/un-committee-presses-vatican-child-abuse) expressed concern that the Church's positions "contribute to the social stigmatization of and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender adolescents and children raised by same sex couples".
1.3.1.9.3. Con: The Church has always said that homosexuals must be [treated](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a6.htm#II) "with respect, compassion and sensitivity".
1.3.1.9.3.1. Con: The same source says that homosexuals are called to [chastity](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a6.htm#II), which clearly discriminates them.
1.3.1.10. Pro: The Church's understanding of physicalness, sexual act and concupiscence as a sin is ridiculous and had no positive influence on European society.
1.3.1.10.1. Pro: Regarding an essential human act, sexual intercourse, as a sin and therefore something "evil" is directly opposed to humans' natural needs.
1.3.1.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.2.
1.3.1.10.2. Pro: Christian morality is the reason why in Western societies sex was \(or still is\) regraded as a taboo or at least shameful. Accordingly it was almost impossible to get help or receive advice about this [topic](http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/biography-sigmund-freud/597.aspx).
1.3.1.10.2.1. Con: Inter-human behavior makes the topic a taboo; not remnants of Christian morality.
1.3.1.10.2.1.1. Con: "[Different religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_sexuality) have different codes of sexual morality, which regulate sexual activity or assign normative values to certain sexually charged actions or thoughts." And so does Christianity.
1.3.1.10.2.1.2. Pro: In societies without Christian remnants a reserved feeling towards sexuality is in place as well. Thus Christian traditions seem to play a minor role only.
1.3.1.10.3. Pro: For the Christian Church sex outside of marriage is [immoral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fornication#Christianity). This is not compatible with Europe's society in the 20th century.
1.3.1.10.3.1. Pro: In [France](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/14/french-more-accepting-of-infidelity-than-people-in-other-countries/) infidelity is widely accepted.
1.3.1.10.4. Con: -> See 1.3.1.10.2.1.2.
1.3.1.10.5. Con: The [image](http://webpage.pace.edu/nreagin/tempmotherhood/fall2003/3/HisPage.html) of the Victorian Lady, both in mind and body, was breaking the ground for the role of women in the society of the 20th century. This evolved independently of the Christian Church.
1.3.1.10.5.1. Con: Victorian feminists, such as [Louisa Hubbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisa_Hubbard#Employment), used Christianity as an argument in favor of female work participation.
1.3.1.10.5.2. Pro: The Victorian Lady was the first in history to engage in widespread employment because of the industrial revolution. Therewith it marks the origin of a working womans' image.
1.3.1.10.5.2.1. Pro: The Society for Promoting the Employment of Women was formed to promote the training of women for them in [industrial](http://logicmgmt.com/1876/overview/victorian_woman/victorian_woman_employment.htm) pursuits.
1.3.1.10.5.2.2. Pro: [Bookkeeping](http://logicmgmt.com/1876/overview/victorian_woman/victorian_woman_employment.htm) became a profession in which female workers found employment.
1.3.1.10.5.2.3. Pro: Distinct female professions were created that stretched as such into the 20th century, such as nursing.
1.3.2. Pro: Church [tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_tax) is an additional tax imposed on members, meaning additional expenses from one's income.
1.3.2.1. Con: Church tax is redistributed to the social engagement of the church and therefore a good cause.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: [Overhead costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_\(business\)) of the Church are very high considering other good causes.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: The Church is not focusing on welfare provision but religious services and thus some funds will have to be diverted.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: There are many church supported NGOs that provide public goods.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: In Germany, a majority of the activities attributed to the churches are actually financed by the [state](http://www.dw.com/en/the-opaque-financing-of-germanys-churches/a-17161371).
1.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: The Catholic network [Caritas](https://www.caritas.eu/about-caritas-europa) is one of the biggest European [wide networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caritas_Internationalis) providing care for those in need.
1.3.2.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.
1.3.2.1.2.2.2. Con: In Germany hardly anything [Caritas](http://www.caritas-germany.org/germancaritasassociation/finances/finances) does is paid for with church taxes.
1.3.2.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Of over 145 million Euros expenses on social projects only 10 million Euros are from Church [subsidies](http://www.caritas-germany.org/germancaritasassociation/finances/finances).
1.3.2.1.2.2.2.2. Pro: The aid organizations Caritas and Diakonie have a Church-quota of [2%](http://www.dw.com/en/the-opaque-financing-of-germanys-churches/a-17161371).
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: The Church runs hospitals, schools, and orphanages providing mass social services to the population.
1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.
1.3.2.1.4. Con: A sizable amount of the money is [channeled](http://blog.mygermanexpert.com/2013/06/10-Facts-about-German-Church-Tax.html) to the Vatican.
1.3.2.1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.
1.3.2.2. Con: Many voluntary associations have similar fees or dues.
1.3.2.3. Con: Positive things that Churches do require funding.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: The Christian church has established many charities and funds to help socially underprivileged, seriously ill or elderly people.
1.3.2.3.1.1. Pro: Single local clergymen broadened communal services that are run locally, such as Cardinal [Gordon Gray](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-cardinal-gordon-gray-1486008.html).
1.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.2.
1.3.2.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.2.1.
1.3.2.4. Con: Church taxes are only an issue in Germany and a few other countries, such as Austria and Italy. Many European countries however [do not have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_tax) it at all.
1.3.2.5. Con: You can decide to leave the Church, and no longer have to pay the tax.
1.3.2.5.1. Con: Leaving the Church entails other costs that are prevented when no church tax is levied.
1.3.2.5.1.1. Pro: Marrying in a church is impossible if one is not a Church member.
1.3.2.5.1.1.1. Con: You can just re-enter church as soon as you want to get married or get your children baptised. Afterwards you can leave the church again.
1.3.2.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Churches like it if members join. This should be easier than leaving the church.
1.3.2.5.1.2. Pro: It becomes impossible to be burried by a pastor.
1.3.2.5.1.3. Pro: There are problems with getting children baptised.
1.3.2.5.1.4. Pro: One looses an insurance against the very unlikely cause that an afterlife exists and church membership matters for this.
1.3.2.5.1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.2.5.1.1.1.
1.3.2.5.2. Pro: By leaving the Church there are more benefits than just not paying church tax. It includes a freedom of mind.
1.3.3. Pro: Churches, bishops, cardinals, and other layers of church organizations waste church members and taxpayers' money.
1.3.3.1. Con: The Church is able to cover most of its expenses through financial speculation.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: In the 1990s the Vatican made around [$1 billion](http://www.theage.com.au/news/Business/Holy-See-in-the-red/2005/04/06/1112489559959.html) per year on stock earnings.  This contrasts with only $ 80 million contributions donations from around the world.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: Initial investments had to be covered by Catholics. It is fair if they receive the returns; not the Church for its operations.
1.3.3.2. Pro: A Pope visit to any country costs taxpayers a lot of money.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: The [US](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/12/21/70001/index.htm) trip in the 1990s cost the taxpayer $6 million and the diocese $20 million.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: The pope's 2015 visit to the UK cost the taxpayer [almost 12 million British Pounds](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/05/popes-uk-visit-cost-12m).
1.3.3.3. Con: In the UK, Catholic's priests [minimum salary](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/will-you-take-this-priest-1601768.html) was £800 a year in the 1990s. This made them rely mostly on donations and not very expensive.
1.3.3.4. Pro: The Church continuously [overspends](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/12/21/70001/index.htm) its budget.
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: The Church is reluctant to sell off its [art treasures](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/12/21/70001/index.htm) to finance its budget deficit.
1.3.3.4.2. Con: A government that overspends its budget is quite natural and done by most states; just so the Holy See.
1.3.3.5. Con: The [Vatican city state](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/12/21/70001/index.htm) runs a comfortable surplus through its museum, stamps and advertisement operations.
1.3.3.6. Pro: The Second Vatican Council transformed the Holy See from a lean machine into a sprawling [bureaucracy](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/12/21/70001/index.htm). This came with increases in expenditure.
1.3.3.6.1. Pro: To carry out Vatican II's goals, the Holy See added ten new [departments](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/12/21/70001/index.htm).
1.3.3.6.2. Pro: From 1981 to 1986 the Holy See's [spending](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/12/21/70001/index.htm) almost doubled.
1.3.3.7. Pro: Since the early 1980s, the [Vatican Bank](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/12/21/70001/index.htm) has not made any significant profits.
1.3.3.7.1. Con: Many banks go bankrupt, for example in times of [recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banks_acquired_or_bankrupted_during_the_Great_Recession). This does not mean that a failing Vatican Bank will cost taxpayers money.
1.3.3.8. Pro: In 2009, German taxpayers had to provide [almost half a billion Euros](http://www.spiegel.de/video/millionen-fuer-die-bischoefe-warum-der-staat-die-gehaelter-der-kirche-zahlt-video-1069449.html) to pay for the wages of cardinals, priests and bishops.
1.3.4. Pro: The corruption of many Christian institutions gravely harmed many Europeans.
1.3.4.1. Pro: [David Starkey](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/the-pope/9935689/Catholic-Church-is-irredeemably-corrupt-David-Starkey-claims.html), a well-known British historian, sees the Catholic Church as “irredeemably corrupt from top to bottom”.
1.3.4.2. Pro: The [Vatican Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_God%27s_Name) was known by Pope John Paul I to be corrupt.
1.3.4.3. Pro: The Catholic Church is an organization, and like any other organized group, has its share of corrupt individuals within its ranks.
1.3.5. Pro: Christian institutions have helped support the legitimacy of European monarchies.
1.3.5.1. Pro: As a form of royal and political legitimization, the Church created the doctrine of the [divine right of kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings). This concept supported the old elites and helped to conserve the conditions.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: According to the [teachings of the Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings), God has given spiritual power and authority to the Church and earthly power and authority to the kings. Questioning the kings' legitimacy and authority is the same as questioning the Church's teachings and the Bible.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: Saint Paul states in [Rom 13](http://walkinginthedesert.com/2015/03/23/did-the-catholic-church-really-support-the-divine-right-of-kings/): “There is no power but from God and those that are, are ordained of God. Therefore he who resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God.”
1.3.5.1.1.2. Pro: In [John 19:11](http://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm) Jesus responded to Pontius Pilate: “You would have no power over me had it not been given you from above”.
1.3.5.1.1.3. Con: This [concept](http://walkinginthedesert.com/2015/03/23/did-the-catholic-church-really-support-the-divine-right-of-kings/) is rather a general medieval idea than a pure Catholic one.
1.3.5.1.2. Con: The catholic writer [Michael Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Davies_\(Catholic_writer\)) maintains that the Church is not committed to any form of government and the Popes were not [opposed](http://walkinginthedesert.com/2015/03/23/did-the-catholic-church-really-support-the-divine-right-of-kings/) to democracy.
1.3.5.1.3. Con: [Saint Robert Bellarmine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bellarmine), a catholic cardinal and theologist, even explained the negative aspects of \(absolute\) [monarchy](http://walkinginthedesert.com/2015/03/23/did-the-catholic-church-really-support-the-divine-right-of-kings/) and pleaded for a mixed government with some democratic elements.
1.3.5.1.4. Pro: The bishop Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet [claimed](http://www.britannica.com/topic/divine-right-of-kings) that the king's person and authority are sacred and his power is directly derived from God in the 17th century.
1.3.5.1.5. Pro: The [Russian](http://alphahistory.com/russianrevolution/enforcing-russian-autocracy/) Tsar’s autocratic rule was reinforced by his claim to divine right.
1.3.5.1.6. Con: By the early twentieth century, the divine right had been virtually abandoned in the [UK](http://manchesterhistorian.com/2014/the-divine-rights-of-kings/).
1.3.5.2. Pro: The Vatican is one of the few remaining [absolute monarchies](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/tom-doyle-vatican-is-the-worlds-last-absolute-monarchy/) in the world.
1.3.5.3. Pro: The Anglican Church is closely intertwined with the British monarchy and thus contributes to its legitimacy.
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: The British monarch is also the [Supreme Governor of the Church of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England).
1.3.6. Con: Christian parties were beneficial for the peaceful integration of European societies.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Christian political parties were in power across Europe during the 20th century and [fostered liberal democracies](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christian-democracy).
1.3.6.2. Pro: Christian inspired political parties were fighting for a more democratic political landscape in Europe.

1.3.6.3. Pro: Christian parties supported [European integration](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30095689?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).

1.3.6.3.2. Pro: The six nations that pioneered the process of European integration all had well-established Christian democratic parties.
1.3.6.3.2.1. Pro: The [British](http://stathis.research.yale.edu/documents/annurev.polisci.11.021406.pdf) at times saw the European integration project as a “Catholic conspiracy, orchestrated from the Vatican".
1.3.6.3.3. Pro: Christian international [networks](http://stathis.research.yale.edu/documents/annurev.polisci.11.021406.pdf) have been functional for creating political trust for the European integration.

1.3.8.1. Pro: Females can become clergy in Protestantism.
1.3.8.2. Pro: Protestant clergy does not have to forego sex.
1.3.8.3. Pro: Protestantism is more decentralized and less focused on Rome and this therefore allows it to be closer to the people, get more input from them and react faster to changes.
1.3.8.4. Pro: Protestantism does not believe in infallibility as the Catholic Church does.
1.3.8.5. Con: The Protestant Church was easy to [coopt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessing_Church#The_New_National_Church_.28Deutsche_Evangelische_Kirche.29) because it lacked supranational organization and its domestic setting was easily taken over.

1.3.11. Con: Church organizations helped the reconciliation of Europeans after conflict.
1.3.11.1. Pro: Historical reconciliation between Poland and Germany was [initiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Reconciliation_of_the_Polish_Bishops_to_the_German_Bishops) by Polish clergy using religion to bridge national and historical divides.

1.3.13.1. Con: Spiritual services can be fulfilled by other religions like Islam, Judaism or Buddhism as well.
1.3.13.1.1. Con: While each of those religions may offer spiritual services, those services may not be something which a Christian person would be open to receiving.

1.3.14. Con: Churches were active in overcoming the great tragedies of European life in the 20th century.

1.3.14.1.2. Pro: The Church of Greece, under Damaskinos’ leadership, [condemned](http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/es/generales/archbishop-damaskinos/) Hitler’s plans for the country and instructed priests to announce its position in their sermons.
1.3.14.1.3. Pro: When the Germans started rounding up Jews, over 600 Greek Orthodox [priests](http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/es/generales/archbishop-damaskinos/) were arrested and deported because of their actions in helping Jews.
1.3.14.1.4. Pro: The Archbishop [ordered](http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/es/generales/archbishop-damaskinos/) monasteries and convents in Athens to shelter Jews, and urged his priests to ask their congregations to hide the Jews in their homes.

1.3.14.2. Pro: Protestants objected to the Nazi regime.
1.3.14.2.1. Pro: Members of the [Confessing Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessing_Church#The_Confessing_Church) objected to the ['Gleichschaltung'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleichschaltung) and many of its pastors were [arrested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessing_Church#Demographics) for this resistance.
1.3.14.2.2. Con: Many Protestants [voted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessing_Church#The_Nazi_regime) for the Nazis in the elections of the 1930s.
1.3.14.2.3. Pro: Dutch Protestants were the most active in organizing a great demonstration against the Nazis in [1941](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_religion_in_the_Netherlands#The_Second_World_War).
1.3.14.2.4. Pro: The Protestant village [Le Chambon-sur-Lignon](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2008/0515/p01s01-woeu.html) was most active against the Vichy Republic and hid some 4,000 Jews.
1.3.14.2.5. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.3.
1.3.14.2.6. Con: -> See 1.3.8.5.
1.3.14.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.8.2.
1.3.14.4. Con: The Pope did not do enough to prevent the Holocaust.
1.3.14.4.1. Con: In 1943, Hitler seriously considered taking the Pope captive. This threat was taken seriously by the Pope himself and prevented further activism on his end [\(p.100\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.1.1. Con: The Pope could go to exile or custody and would therewith serve the Jews.
1.3.14.4.2. Con: The diplomatic corps of the Vatican worked under the direct guidance of the Pope and this saved some Jews [\(p.xii\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.2.1. Con: There are no figures for how many people the diplomatic corps of the Vatican saved. Thus, its contribution remains dubious.
1.3.14.4.3. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.3.1.
1.3.14.4.4. Con: [Pius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XII_and_the_Holocaust) employed diplomacy to aid the victims of the Nazis during the war and, through directing his Church to provide discreet aid to Jews and others, saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
1.3.14.4.4.1. Con: The Pope did not challenge the Croat [Ustashi](https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/shofar/summary/v020/20.4baranowski.html) government that was prosecuting Jews according to Nazi laws.
1.3.14.4.4.1.1. Pro: The local Bishop denounced the killing but other Croation bishops did not follow suit. It is the Pope's responsibility to give clear directions [\(p.34\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.4.1.2. Pro: It is impossible that the Pope did not know that the Ustashi murders amounted to genocide [\(p.38\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.4.1.3. Con: There was little the Pope could do because the situation was very chaotic after the invasion of the Axis and the proclamation of an independent Croatia.
1.3.14.4.4.1.3.1.

More direct criticism would thus have been possible in Croatia as well.
1.3.14.4.4.1.3.2. Pro: The Pope has no army.
1.3.14.4.4.1.3.3. Pro: The Pope's influence was limited by his [Archbishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ustashe#Connections_with_the_Catholic_Church) speaking out in favor of Ustashi.
1.3.14.4.4.1.3.3.1. Pro: The Pope speaking out against Utashi would then likely have sent different messages, making the Croatians confused as to which stance the Church was taking.
1.3.14.4.4.1.4. Pro: The Papacy did not distribute the information of opposing Croat Bishop Stepinac to other Bishops across Europe [\(p.47\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.4.1.5. Pro: The Pope saw a chance to prevent more Croats turning to Orthodox belief or communism because the fascists supported Catholicism [\(p.32\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.4.2. Con: The Pope did not [shelter or protect](https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/shofar/summary/v020/20.4baranowski.html) Jews when they were deported from Rome.

1.3.14.4.4.3.1. Pro: Priests were instructed to issue [baptism certificates](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/hitlers-pope-pius-xii-holocaust) to hundreds of Jews hidden in Genoa, Rome and elsewhere in Italy.
1.3.14.4.4.3.2. Pro: More than 2,000 Jews in Hungary were given fabricated [Vatican documents](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/hitlers-pope-pius-xii-holocaust) identifying them as Catholics.
1.3.14.4.4.3.3. Pro: More than 4,000 Jews were [hidden](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/hitlers-pope-pius-xii-holocaust) in convents and monasteries across Italy.

1.3.14.4.5. Con: Jewish leaders praised the Pope for his actions so he cannot be accused of having not done enough.
1.3.14.4.5.1. Pro: Former Israeli diplomat Pinchas Lapide demonstrates convincingly the [protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Popes_and_the_Jews) provided to Jews in Europe by the papacy.
1.3.14.4.5.2. Pro: Rabbi David G. Dalin argues that Popes through history have [defended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Hitler's_Pope) the Jews and also did so during the Holocaust.

1.3.14.4.5.4. Con: During the War, allied commanders decried the lack of moral fortitude of the Pope and pressured him to condemn the Holocaust [\(p.49\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.5.5. Pro: When Pius XII died in 1958, there were [tributes](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/apr/25/20060425-090125-3941r/) from virtually every Jewish group around the world.
1.3.14.4.6. Pro: The Pope [did not](https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/shofar/summary/v020/20.4baranowski.html) share intelligence information he possessed with resistance groups nor supported them financially.
1.3.14.4.6.1. Pro: Even though it had access to information about the genocide in Eastern Europe, the Vatican did not forward this information to France, where the roundup of Jews was yet to begin [\(p.46\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.6.2. Pro: The Pope did withhold information about the mass killing of Jews when Allied investigations sought verification with Vatican intelligence [\(p.49\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.7. Pro: The Catholic Church was used to receiving guidance from the Pope. Absent any clear statements individual Bishops were unsure what to do or acted independently [\(p.xi\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.4.4.1.1.
1.3.14.4.7.2. Pro: Since 1870, the [infallibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_infallibility) proclamation made it clear that only the Pope can make an absolute decision.
1.3.14.4.8. Con: By not speaking out stronger the Pope did not jeopardize the Jews that were rescued by the Church. At least some were saved.
1.3.14.4.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.4.4.3.
1.3.14.4.8.2. Pro: After the Archbishop of Utrecht publicly protested against Nazi treatment of Jews in July 1942, the Germans retaliated by seizing Catholics of Jewish descent. This showed the Pope what to expect [\(p.54\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.8.2.1. Con: Earlier, while in Croatia, the Pope did not speak up even before he was aware of the potential consequences of a clear statement [\(p.55\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.9. Con: The Vatican made clear diplomatic gestures showing that it objected to Hitler.
1.3.14.4.9.1. Con: The Church accepted the introduction of Church taxes in [Austria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_tax#Austria) by Hitler in 1939. A clear diplomatic posture would have foregone this financial incentive.
1.3.14.4.9.2. Con: The Pope remained silent when ten thousands of Catholic priests, intellectuals and politicians were murdered.
1.3.14.4.9.3. Con: The Pope stopped to speak out once the genocide in Poland started [\(p.41\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).

1.3.14.4.9.5. Pro: The Pope left Rome when Hitler visited it [\(p.2\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).

1.3.14.4.9.7.3. Pro: In the late 1930s, the Pope said on two occasions that there is only one human race and that racism should thus be opposed [\(p.2\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.9.7.4. Con: The Pope did rarely speak about the Jews in his communication with Bishops even though they longed for a coordinated response [\(p.51-52\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.9.7.5. Con: -> See 1.3.14.4.9.3.
1.3.14.4.10. Pro: Pius XII was [antisemitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler's_Pope) himself.
1.3.14.4.10.1. Pro: The Pope told the United States in 1942 that he believed reports of German atrocities against Jews were [exaggerated](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/reviews/Cornwell.html).

1.3.14.4.10.4. Con: -> See 1.3.14.4.4.3.
1.3.14.4.10.5. Con: Pius' XII early negative connotation of Jews [do not recall](https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=3984) the ideological direction of Nazism.
1.3.14.4.10.6. Con: The strongest advocate of this position, John Cornell, later made a less strong claim and effectively [dropped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler's_Pope#Cornwell.27s_later_views) the antisemitism charge.
1.3.14.4.11. Pro: The Pope knew about the Holocaust. As a religious leader this gave him a duty to act.
1.3.14.4.11.1. Pro: On May 12, 1942, Italian priest Pirro Scavizzi wrote to Pope Pius informing him of the mass murder of Jews \([p.47](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf)\).
1.3.14.4.11.2. Pro: In October of 1941, the Vatican got reports from Chargé d’Affaires Giuseppe Burzio, Slovakia, about Jews being immediately shot by Germans [\(p.47\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).

1.3.14.4.12. Con: The Pope feared aerial bombing of the Vatican by either the Germans or the Allied and thus had to be neutral and conciliatory to both sides [\(p.43\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.12.1. Pro: In October 1942, the Vatican attempted to extract a promise from Winston Churchill to not bomb Rome [\(p.62\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.3.14.4.12.2. Pro: The Pope repeatedly wrote to Roosevelt to avoid areal bombing of Rome [\(p.63\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).

Pro: The Holy See collaborated with fascist regimes throughout the 20th century, as the concordates with [Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateran_Treaty), [Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskonkordat) and [Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordat_of_1953) show.
1.3.14.4.14.1. Con: Christianity is much broader than just the Roman Catholic Church, and many Protestants like [Karl Barth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Barth) and [Dietrich Bonhoeffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer) stood firm against fascist regimes.
1.3.14.4.15. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.4.4.1.
1.3.14.5. Con: -> See 1.3.14.4.14.
1.3.14.6. Pro: The Church was instrumental in bringing communism to an end.
1.3.14.6.1. Pro: The Pope's visit to Poland in 1979 was [significant](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122479408458463941) in bringing communism to an end.

1.3.14.6.2. Pro: The Pope sought to enlarge Germany as a [bulwark](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf) against communism. \(p. 59\)
1.3.14.6.3. Con: Because Christianity saw communism as evil the Pope could not be an honest broker.
1.3.14.6.3.1. Pro: The fight against communism was framed as a defense of Christianity and, thus, followed the same pattern in the 20th century as it did in the crusades.
1.3.14.6.3.1.1. Pro: The [Christian Anti-Communism Crusade](http://rightweb.irc-online.org/christian_anti-communism_crusade/) was influential in the 1960s demanding a more stringent reaction to communism.
1.3.14.6.3.1.2. Pro: Christian anti-communism is [historically](http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/whic/AcademicJournalsDetailsPage/AcademicJournalsDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&prodId=WHIC&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Journals&dviSelectedPage=&limiter=&currPage=&disableHighlighting=true&displayGroups=&sortBy=&zid=&search_within_results=&p=WHIC%3AUHIC&action=e&catId=&activityType=&scanId=&documentId=GALE%7CA381666679&source=Bookmark&u=imgacademy&jsid=fd94088c4f4e037de629a9cf98477be8) rooted in the erosion of Christian authority in society.
1.3.14.6.3.1.3. Pro: In [Divini Redemptoris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divini_Redemptoris) the pope declared communism to be anti-Christian.
1.3.14.6.3.1.3.1. Pro: The term '[terrorism](http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/whic/AcademicJournalsDetailsPage/AcademicJournalsDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&prodId=WHIC&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&display-query=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Journals&dviSelectedPage=&limiter=&currPage=&disableHighlighting=true&displayGroups=&sortBy=&zid=&search_within_results=&p=WHIC%3AUHIC&action=e&catId=&activityType=&scanId=&documentId=GALE%7CA381666679&source=Bookmark&u=imgacademy&jsid=fd94088c4f4e037de629a9cf98477be8)' appeared seven times in Divini Redemptoris, solidifying the Catholic position that communism was interchangeable with terrorism.
1.3.14.6.3.2. Pro: Communism was seen as "[rival](http://www.redmoonrising.com/AmericanBabylon/christandcomm.htm)" to Christianity by Martin Luther King Jr.
1.3.14.6.3.3. Pro: At the end of World War II, the Holy Office had officially [excommunicated](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/11/the-vaticans-journey-from-anti-communism-to-anti-capitalism/281874/) communists from the Catholic Church and declared the ideology at odds with fundamental tenets of the faith.
1.3.14.6.3.4. Pro: In 1964, Pope Paul VI made a clear statement against communism in his encyclical [Ecclesiam Suam](http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_06081964_ecclesiam.html): “We are driven to repudiate such ideologies as deny God and oppress the Church”.
1.3.14.6.3.5. Con: There were Christian communists, such as [Thomas J. Hagerty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Hagerty), [Ernst Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Bloch), [Diane Drufenbrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Drufenbrock) or [Camilo Torres Restrepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilo_Torres_Restrepo).
1.3.14.6.4. Con: The Pope took very little public action against communism.
1.3.14.6.4.1. Con: To preserve a status of peacemaker the Pope had to remain neutral.
1.3.14.6.5. Pro: In Poland, churches [provided](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28398-2005Apr5.html) a credible source of information and served venues for cultural performances prohibited by the regime.
1.3.14.6.6. Con: Being Archbishop of Krakaw, Karol [Wojtyla](http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/2008/august/what-part-did-pope-john-paul-ii-play-in-opposing-communism.html) did not directly challenge communist rule.
1.3.14.6.7. Con: The Catholic Church was mainly effective in Poland only and not in other parts of Eastern Europe.
1.3.14.6.7.1. Pro: In Czechoslovakia, the Communists branded the Church as an enemy of the public due to their alliance with the monarchy that had ruled the country before [\(p.347\)](http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0034670500007130).
1.3.14.6.7.2. Con: Across the Soviet Bloc the Pope encouraged local Bishops in the [Invicti athletae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invicti_athletae) to stand firm against suppression.
1.3.14.6.7.3. Con: The Pope [excommunicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecutions_of_the_Catholic_Church_and_Pius_XII#Church_diplomacy) those who imprisoned Cardinals and Bishops across the whole of the Soviet Union.
1.3.14.6.7.4. Pro: In many other Eastern European countries the Church was practically [eliminated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecutions_of_the_Catholic_Church_and_Pius_XII#Catholic_Ruthenian_and_Ukrainian_Churches) and thus ineffective outside Poland.
1.3.14.6.7.5. Con: The Church was active with the [Ukrainian Greek Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Greek_Catholic_Church_in_the_USSR#Pope_John_Paul_II_and_tensions_vis-.C3.A0-vis_the_Ukrainian_Greek_Catholic_Church) church which was, just as in Poland, associated with dissident political opinions.
1.3.14.6.8. Pro: The "[martyr cardinals](http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9303/reviews/gershman.html)", such as the Hungarian [Jozsef Mindszenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3zsef_Mindszenty) and the Pole [Stefan Wyszynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Wyszy%C5%84ski), were symbols of resistance to Stalinist oppression during the height of the Cold War.
1.3.14.6.9. Pro: The Second Vatican Council initiated a period of dialogue with Communism based upon the view that [movements](http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9303/reviews/gershman.html) could change.
1.3.14.6.10. Pro: The Church rejected the [Yalta-system](http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9303/reviews/gershman.html) of a divided Europe and therewith objected to the split up of Europe.
1.3.14.6.11. Pro: The declaration of [religious freedom](http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9303/reviews/gershman.html) of the Second Vatican Council challenged the essence of the totalitarian state and its Leninist ideology and put the weight of the Catholic Church behind democracy.
1.3.14.6.12. Con: Not all countries under communism were Catholic. Thus the effect of the Church was limited.
1.3.14.6.12.1. Pro: Numerous former Soviet Republics, such as [Uzbekistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Uzbekistan), [Turkmenistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Turkmenistan), [Tajikistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Tajikistan), [Kyrgyzstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Kyrgyzstan), [Kazakhstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Kazakhstan)and [Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Azerbaijan) were predominantly Muslim.
1.3.14.6.13. Con: In 1954, the Church discussed the possibility of [peaceful coexistence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecutions_of_the_Catholic_Church_and_Pius_XII#Catholic_Ruthenian_and_Ukrainian_Churches) after Stalin died.
1.3.14.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.11.
1.3.15. Con: The [church](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic_hospitals_represent_26_percent_of_worlds_health_facilities_reports_pontifical_council) was then \(and still is\) the largest [healthcare](https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/25/us/health-care-debate-catholic-church-catholic-leaders-dilemma-abortion-vs.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm) system in the world.
1.3.16. Pro: The Church covered up thousands of cases of child [abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases) worldwide.
1.3.16.1. Pro: The Church in Rome [kidnapped](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/9283407/Emanuela-Orlandi-was-kidnapped-for-sex-parties-for-Vatican-police.html) a teenage girl for sex parties.
1.4. Con: Christian theology negatively impacted Europeans.
1.4.1. Pro: Christian theology served as pretext for violence in the 20th century.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Christian faith was invoked to justify violence in [Northern Ireland.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarian_violence_among_Christians#Ireland)
1.4.1.1.1. Con: The [Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles) are essentially a conflict between nationalists and unionists who just happen to be of the other religion. Christianity has little impact.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Protestant identity is [strongly linked](http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1068&context=utk_chanhonoproj) to Unionist identity, just as Catholicism is strongly linked to Irish Nationalist identity. Because of these links devotion to these religions strongly fuel devotion to these identities.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Orthodox Christian movements in Romania, such as the Iron Guard and Lăncieri, were [responsible](http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/about/events/pdf/report/english/1.1_Roots_of_Romanian_Antisemitism.pdf) for the Bucharest pogrom and for political murders during the 1930s.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.14.1.
1.4.1.3. Con: The secular state was responsible for [innumerable deaths](https://www.historyonthenet.com/how-many-people-died-in-ww1/) that the church could hardly scratch the surface of. Every human heart can twist any ideology, however pure, to violence.
1.4.2. Pro: Modern Human Rights discourse is generally opposed to Christian thought, which was deeply entrenched during the 20th century.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Christianity does generally not encourage freedom and thus cannot be conducive to European ethics.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Freedom to choose one's religion, a cornerstone of today's European ethics, certainly does not originate from Christianity.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Christianity encourages [biblical freedom](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/october/bonds-of-freedom.html) which is unequal to the freedom generally understood in cultural terms.
1.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: Biblical freedom is trusting obedience in God while cultural freedom is understood as self-determination.
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: For Christianity real freedom is found only in giving up every [secular](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/october/bonds-of-freedom.html) aspect of freedom.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Christian theology had bad effects on gender issues.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: The Holy See claims that [transsexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Vatican_City) is a mental disease.
1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: The Vatican does not [fundamentally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Vatican_City) oppose sex changing surgeries.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.9.2.
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: Prohibition of contraception and abortions led to health risks for women.
1.4.2.2.4. Pro: Prohibition of contraception has been [counterproductive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5720389/) in the fight against STDs such as Aids.
1.4.2.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.4.2.2.5. Con: Gender balance improved in the 20th century. Thus, the effect of Christian thought was marginal only.
1.4.2.2.6. Pro: The Vatican [opposes](http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/update/bn073104.htm) feminism.
1.4.2.2.6.1. Con: The Vatican opposes merely the idea that women and men are not only a [social construct](http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/update/bn073104.htm) but real existing categories.
1.4.2.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.8.2.
1.4.2.2.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.4.2.2.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.6.
1.4.2.2.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.7.
1.4.2.2.6.6. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.3.
1.4.2.3. Con: The roots of European liberalism lie in Christian Protestantism.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Luther's "[sola fide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_fide)" is the doctrine that belief is all that counts in religion. Thus everyone has the liberty to worship God in their own way.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: By the time of the [German Peasants' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Peasants%27_War#Luther_and_M.C3.BCntzer) Luther was fast to change his interpretation of his own works. Thus, even for himself his writings were not even valid for a long time; speak alone of the 20th century.
1.4.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Even if this was the case, one cannot take back, what one has said or proclaimed. The teaching was out there and had an impact on the German people, whether Luther later liked it or not.
1.4.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: What is said by theologians is never 100% clear and up for interpretation. Thus, Luther was not taking his comments back but clarifying the interpretation.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: Indigenous [origins](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674419032) of postwar German democracy are found in Christian politics that tried to break out of the constraints of minority-group politics and form a democratic political party.
1.4.2.3.3. Pro: Christian democracy is furthering a conception of liberalism in European societies.
1.4.2.3.3.1. Pro: Christian democracy is characterized by its '[catch-all](http://stathis.research.yale.edu/documents/annurev.polisci.11.021406.pdf)' profile. This makes it compromise oriented and works against extremists.
1.4.2.3.3.1.1. Con: Non-Christians are not included in the catch-all phrase
1.4.2.3.3.2. Pro: In Christian democracy there is a fundamental [commitment](http://stathis.research.yale.edu/documents/annurev.polisci.11.021406.pdf) to human rights.
1.4.2.3.3.3. Pro: Christian democracies make frequent use of [mediation](http://stathis.research.yale.edu/documents/annurev.polisci.11.021406.pdf) tactics to keep society together.
1.4.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: The principle of [subsidiarity](http://stathis.research.yale.edu/documents/annurev.polisci.11.021406.pdf) can be traced back to Christian politics of mediation.
1.4.2.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
1.4.2.3.5. Con: [Christian democracy](http://stathis.research.yale.edu/documents/annurev.polisci.11.021406.pdf) was a concept coined in opposition to liberal democracy because, at first, the Church was vehemently opposed to such ideas.
1.4.2.4. Con: The idea of equality, vital to a democratic society, is already contained in the "everybody equal before God" of the Christian religion.
1.4.2.4.1. Con: Equal before God, does not equate equality in between humans. Rather this statement only makes sense, if there is inequality between humans, but STILL, before God, they are all equal.
1.4.2.4.1.1. Pro: When the Church was in strong power most people lived in hovels while only a privileged few lived in palaces.
1.4.2.4.1.2. Con: It is similar to "Equality Before The Law" in Germany, which does not mean that everybody is de facto equal. Instead, it states that everybody in front of court shall be treated equally. It is a normative claim, just as in Christianity.
1.4.2.4.2. Con: Christianity crowned all the monarchs in Europe, they certainly did not promote the idea of equality of people on Earth.
1.4.2.4.2.1. Con: Of all European monarchies [today](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_%281913%29/Coronation), only the United Kingdom still retains its medieval coronation rite, though even this ritual has been altered in the last few centuries.
1.4.2.4.2.2. Con: According to Christian teachings, even kings were to be judged by God in the afterlife, just as every other Christian, which means that everyone will be treated equally.
1.4.2.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.1.
1.4.2.4.3. Con: Slavery is condoned in the Bible. There are even instructions as how to [handle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery) slaves.
1.4.2.4.4. Pro: The idea of equality also increased the value of every single life.
1.4.2.4.4.1. Pro: Before Europe became Christian, the life of slaves or gladiators, for example, did not have the same value as the life of citizens of Rome or the Ancient Greece.
1.4.2.4.4.1.1. Con: In Christianity the life of non-Christians had not the same value as Christians before the Second Vatican Council acknowledged the equality of other religions.
1.4.2.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: [Pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom#Events_that_were_originally_called_pogroms) were common in Europe and therefore little of Jewish culture was absorbed.
1.4.2.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: The Catholic accusation that Jews are responsible for killing Jesus facilitated the Holocaust.
1.4.2.4.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: The Jews as a people not anymore being blamed for the killing of the Messiah became a doctrine only after the [2nd Vatican Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostra_aetate) around 1965.
1.4.2.4.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: Christian theology in the 1920s still accused the Jews for being blind to recognize the Messiahs [\(p.1\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.4.2.4.4.1.1.2.3. Con: Christian theology in the 1920s rejected antisemitic hatred and unjust prosecution of Jews [\(p.1\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.4.2.4.4.1.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.14.4.9.7.2.
1.4.2.4.4.1.1.2.5. Con: In the 1920s the papacy started to interpret Christians as sons of Abraham and thus made antisemitism incompatible with Christianity [\(p.3\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.4.2.4.4.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.4.4.1.1.2.1.
1.4.2.4.4.2. Con: Many women, especially in Northern Europe, had more rights and liberties before Christianity arose.
1.4.2.4.4.2.1. Pro: Most of the Icelandic sagas portray women as strong and wise [characters](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/women.htm).
1.4.2.4.4.2.2. Pro: In Iceland getting a divorce was relatively easy and could result in severe financial [burdens](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/women.htm) for the husband.
1.4.2.4.4.2.3. Pro: [Viking](http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-vikings) women could inherit property, request a divorce and reclaim their dowries if their marriages ended.
1.4.2.4.4.2.4. Con: Women's rights were clearly limited in Viking society. The separation was so strict and harshly enforced that an end to the Viking tradition liberated women.
1.4.2.4.4.2.4.1. Pro: The medieval Icelandic lawbook Grágás [prohibits](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/women.htm) women from wearing men's clothes, from cutting their hair short, or from carrying weapons
1.4.2.4.4.2.4.1.1. Con: The Grágás starts out with the sentence that 'all people in the country must be Christian'. Thus Christianity did not improve female roles in Viking society.
1.4.2.4.4.2.4.1.2. Pro: Women had no right of [property](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/women.htm).
1.4.2.4.4.2.4.1.2.1. Con: Women had the right to [inherit](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/women.htm) their husband's property.
1.4.2.4.4.2.4.1.3. Pro: Women were prohibited to engage in [political](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/women.htm) activities.
1.4.2.4.4.2.4.2. Con: Comparing to other, more Christian, societies at the time, women were respected in Norse society and had great freedom.
1.4.2.4.4.2.4.2.1. Pro: Women managed the [finances](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/women.htm) of the family.
1.4.2.4.4.2.4.2.2. Pro: The Grágás lists [penalties](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/society/text/women.htm) for offences for female harassment.
1.4.2.4.4.2.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.4.4.2.4.1.2.1.
1.4.2.4.5. Pro: The direct link between individual and God creates the foundation for individualism because it makes the individual responsible for her/his actions.
1.4.2.4.5.1. Pro: Human Rights were found on the notion of individualism because they are [individually](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13698230500187151) justified in which human rights a person judges to be the highest.
1.4.2.4.5.2. Pro: A feeling of personal responsibility prevents anarchy and creates the foundation for a democratic society by educating good citizens.
1.4.2.4.5.2.1. Pro: A feeling of personal responsibility is a cornerstone of 'good' citizens [education](http://aer.sagepub.com/content/41/2/237.short).
1.4.2.4.5.2.2. Pro: Greater personal responsibility leads to a more critical reflection on biases. This is created through [dialog](https://www.hampshire.edu/sites/default/files/shared_files/IGD-diversitydemocracyfinal.pdf) with others.
1.4.2.4.5.2.3. Con: A democracy can survive without problems if many citizens do not care about personal or social responsibility.
1.4.2.4.6. Pro: The Christian concept of dignity supported the cause of those who advocated dignity to be an inalienable part of humans.
1.4.2.4.6.1. Pro: The [Catechism of the Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity#Religion) promulgated in 1992 sees human dignity rooted in the image and likeness of God and therefore necessary part of any person.
1.4.2.4.6.2. Pro: The Church's concept of dignity and the one of [Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity#Religion) overlap creating a powerful advocacy position.
1.4.2.4.6.3. Con: Dignity, or [Kavod HaBriyot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavod_HaBriyot), is also a concept dealt with in Judaism and thus older then Christianity.
1.4.2.4.6.3.1. Con: Everyday Judaism was not influential in the 20th century Europe.
1.4.2.4.6.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.4.4.1.1.1.
1.4.2.5. Con: The Christian code of behavior, the [Ten Commandments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments), had an enduring influence on European sense of morality and conscience which led to a positive effect on the social cooperation of citizens.
1.4.2.5.1. Pro: Commandments such as "you shall not murder", "you shall not steal" or "your shall not bear false witness" had an influence on our criminal law.
1.4.2.5.1.1. Con: Such principles were already in place before Christianity, e.g. in Roman law, ancient Germanic law or Anglo-Saxon law.
1.4.2.5.1.1.1. Pro: In [Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Germanic_law) law any injury must be compensated according to the damage done, regardless of motive or intent. Even for capital crimes like murder, the compensation is a weregeld.
1.4.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Germanic law was influenced by [ecclesiastical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Germanic_law) law. So the Church was of major importance in the completion of Germanic law.
1.4.2.5.1.1.2. Pro: The [Anglo-Saxons](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/trail/conquest/wessex_kings/anglosaxon_law_05.shtml) placed a high value on a person's word, their sworn promise. The origins of the law date back to times before Chistianity.
1.4.2.5.1.1.3. Pro: [Furtum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furtum) was a delict of Roman law comparable to the modern offence of theft.
1.4.2.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: The Roman's copied old Greek laws, such as the [Solonian Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solonian_Constitution), which existed before the advent of Christianity.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4. Con: The first and second commandments had no precedent in other ancient Near Eastern codes and thus can be seen as uniquely added [\(p.122\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=HURKAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=ten+commandments+EU+ethics&source=bl&ots=UOmDrIlAWD&sig=5ORF8frP8o1g54y2lvt8nAXALkg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY8NjwxMLLAhVDHpQKHVRwDpkQ6AEIITAC#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1. Con: The first and second commandment are not important regarding a European sense of morality.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The obligation to be servile to one God works as example for relations between superiors and inferiors.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: This did not improve 'inferior' Europeans' quality of life, but actually made it worse.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: These 'inferior' people had to submit themselves to 'superiors' just because their religion wanted them to.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Hierarchy is universal in the world and nothing created by Christianity.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Whether someone is 'inferior' should not be determined by religion but by individual accomplishments.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.3. Pro: The subordination of women to men did not improve female Europeans' life.

1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.5. Con: Not all inferiors suffer, e.g. children towards their parents, siblings among eachother or students towards workers.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Teachers vis-a-vis students are understood to be supportive and their relationship meant to reach one of [equality](http://biblehub.com/luke/6-40.htm). This makes them more of a team working together.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: According to the story of [Joseph](http://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/people/related-articles/sibling-rivalries-and-younger-sons.aspx) the older brother's task is to be mild and supportive for younger brothers. This will lead to a more gentle approach of older brothers.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: Life is full of hierarchy and needs processes that regulate power differentials.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.3. Con: Strictly sticking to the second commandment, "thou shalt have no other gods before me", can also result in a total decline of any human hierarchy, because Christians feel only being subject to their God.
1.4.2.5.1.1.4.1.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.4.5.
1.4.2.5.1.1.5. Pro: [Buddhist precepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Precepts) share striking similarity with the sixth to ninth commandments [\(p.122\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=HURKAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=ten+commandments+EU+ethics&source=bl&ots=UOmDrIlAWD&sig=5ORF8frP8o1g54y2lvt8nAXALkg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY8NjwxMLLAhVDHpQKHVRwDpkQ6AEIITAC#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.4.2.5.1.1.6. Con: The Ten Commandments were wider than [Hammurabi's Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi) because they speak of good and bad, which is an essential ethical question not present before.
1.4.2.5.1.1.7. Con: Legal traditions before were not comprehensive in their reach to include all of Europe. Thus, it was only through the unifying force of Christianity that local standards could be generalized Europe wide.
1.4.2.5.1.2. Pro: The Ten Commandments worked as a solution to the [bottleneck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottleneck) problem given the myriads of other important rules of life are possible while at the same time being applicable throughout times.
1.4.2.5.1.2.1. Con: There are [alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternatives_to_the_Ten_Commandments#Examples) Ten Commandments that could be equally applicable.
1.4.2.5.1.2.2. Pro: Roman Law was enshrined in the [Twelve Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Tables) but they became obsolete because of their time-related focus.
1.4.2.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: The Twelve Tables were [destroyed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law#The_Twelve_Tables) and its content was lost.
1.4.2.5.1.2.3. Pro: The Greek [Solonian Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solonian_Constitution) was written as poetry and thus difficult to adapt to modernity since poetry resided into an art form.
1.4.2.5.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.5.1.1.1.1.
1.4.2.5.1.2.5. Pro: There are highly specialized ten commandments of [Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments_of_Computer_Ethics) Ethic and they are only applicable to a niche.
1.4.2.5.1.2.6. Pro: The [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas) was too comprehensive to implement. It was also written in Sanskrit which made this even more difficult.
1.4.2.5.1.2.7. Pro: While equally comprehensive the Egyptian [Negative Confessions](http://theancientsacredmysteries.com/42_negative_confessions.htm) were too long. In this sense, Moses narrowed them down to what is important.
1.4.2.5.1.2.8. Pro: Even though the [Book of Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) worked well to govern China it was simply too far to reach Europe.
1.4.2.5.2. Pro: Human rights were influenced by the commandments, as they provide a basic understanding of what a human right is.
1.4.2.5.2.1. Pro: In "The Ten Commandments and Human Rights" Christian theologian [Walter Harrelson](http://religionhumanrights.com/Law/UDHR/cornerstone.fhr.htm) argues, that human rights can be derived from biblical duties. In that sense, the Bible has much to say about human rights. It is possible to see in the basic understandings of human rights, reflected in, for example, the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a large measure of the biblical understanding of human obligation under God.
1.4.2.5.3. Con: The Ten Commandments are equally relevant for [Islam](http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/5114/viewall/ten-commandments-in-quran/) but did not have the same effect as a different sense of morality emerged. This suggests that other factors were more important to create a sense of morality and conscience.
1.4.2.5.4. Pro: The Ten Commandments incorporate Hebrew ethics with other world ethics. Thus, they were more comprehensive and commanding than other legal traditions [\(p.122\)](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=HURKAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=ten+commandments+EU+ethics&source=bl&ots=UOmDrIlAWD&sig=5ORF8frP8o1g54y2lvt8nAXALkg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY8NjwxMLLAhVDHpQKHVRwDpkQ6AEIITAC#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.4.2.5.5. Con: Jesus partly revised the Ten Commandments when he weakened the obligation to rest on the [Sabbath](http://www.cogwriter.com/command.htm).
1.4.2.5.6. Con: The interpretation of adultery changed significantly since the time of the Ten Commandments. In [Jesus](http://www.cogwriter.com/command.htm) times, marrying a divorced woman was already adultery.
1.4.2.5.6.1. Con: Jesus told the Pharisees that marrying a divorced woman was already adultery. It was not considered so generally. Jesus' statement was a novelty; in fact his listeners were shocked \(gospel of [Matthew 19:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019:10)\). The general debate about divorce between the schools of Hillel and Shammai was whether a man could divorce his wife for trivial things or only for grave situations. See: Babylonian Talmud \(Talmud Bavli\), tractate Gittin, 90a.
1.4.2.5.7. Pro: The Ten Commandments aimed at making [humans perfect](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03068299810214089) while in Judaism it focused on the role of humans on earth and in Islam to regulate daily life. This encouraged a drive to continuously improve in Christianity.
1.4.2.6. Pro: The churches oppose euthanasia.
1.4.2.6.1. Pro: The Catholic Church issued a separate [declaration](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm) that clearly prohibited euthanasia in 1980.
1.4.2.6.2. Pro: Even during the [Nazi regime](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_euthanasia_and_the_Catholic_Church) the Church opposed the practiced euthanasia.
1.4.2.6.3. Con: Many individual advocates \(such as [Joseph Fletcher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fletcher)\) and euthanasia society activists have been Protestant clergy and can be found in the [1950s](http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1174&context=lnq) already.
1.4.2.7. Con: Christianity embraced the peaceful [coexistence](http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_nostra-aetate_en.html) among believers and non-believers and therewith enhanced peaceful multiculturalism in European societies.
1.4.2.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.4.2.7.2. Pro: Loving your neighbor as yourself is the second most important commandment, as stated by Jesus \(mark 12:31\).  At a different time, Jesus elaborated on who your neighbor is by telling the parable of the good Samaritan \(luke 10:25-37\), which when summed up states that everyone, even those you hate, are considered your neighbor and you should treat as yourself.
1.4.2.7.3. Pro: The notion of equality is deeply entrenched in Christian ethics, a pillar of today's European ethics.
1.4.2.7.3.1. Pro: The apostle Paul's life-long work was setting up multi-ethnic church communities. It is evident in all of his letters that he wanted to transcend ethnic barriers. In Galatians he writes "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
1.4.2.7.3.2. Pro: Acts 10:28 - And he said to them, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a man who is a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; and yet God has shown me that I should not call any man unholy or unclean".
1.4.2.7.3.3. Pro: James 2:2-4 - For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes, and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes, and say, "You sit here in a good place," and you say to the poor man, "You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool," have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?
1.4.2.7.3.4. Pro: Acts 17:26 - And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
1.4.2.7.3.5. Pro: Galatians 3:28 - There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
1.4.2.7.3.6. Pro: Romans 10:12 - For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
1.4.2.7.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.4.
1.4.2.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.4.2.8. Con: Changes in theology paved the way for the development of revolutionary ideas that are indispensable for Human Rights to evolve.
1.4.2.8.1. Pro: Saint Augustine broke through the antique perception of life as a cycle and came up with life as a linear concept, which not only changed perception of human life, but how we understand development.
1.4.2.8.1.1. Pro: Civitas dei and civitas terrena as concepts of two spheres of life, where the one \(dei\) follows the other \(terrena\) with an absolute ending point \(civitas dei\) helped establish heaven and hell.
1.4.2.8.2. Pro: The Vatican Council of 1962 was a major milestone for progress in European theological understanding shining beyond academia into everyone's life.
1.4.2.8.2.1. Pro: The Second Vatican Council [ignored](https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ctsa/article/download/3520/3113) divine providence as a concept that needs to be carried on into the future and thus served the people of Europe.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1. Pro: Hope can be a negative effect, since divine [providence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_providence) can make people rely more on hope than their own strength.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1. Con: The idea that God loves creation inspired progressive movements.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Environmental groups were inspired by the idea to preserve God's creation.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Loving the environment is seen as a [responsibility](http://www.christianitytoday.com/iyf/hottopics/faithvalues/loving-environment-is-christian-responsibility.html) of Christians.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: There are many NGOs that emerged with a religious motivation for the protection of the environment.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The [European Christian Environmental Network](http://www.ecen.org/content/god-creation-and-climate-change-spiritual-and-ethical-perspectives) advocates environmental protection to protect God's creation.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: [A Rocha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rocha) was founded by an Anglican priest and operates close to the values of the church.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: The [Catholic Climate Covenant](http://www.catholicclimatecovenant.org/) aims to unite the voice of Catholics and therewith create a strong impact on policy makers to fight climate change.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: [Evangelical environmentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_environmentalism) evolved as distinct environmental movement showing the contribution of Christian thought for the movement.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Given that priests are the biggest [skeptics](http://homebrewedchristianity.com/2009/04/16/evangelicals-and-global-warming/) of climate change, Christian belief seems unlikely to be a good guide in environmental issues.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.5. Con: Christian teaching says that humans own the world, which gives support to skeptics of climate change.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Many Christians believe that this supports a claim for environmental protection as God gave them the world and they need to protect and value his creation now.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: In European countries with strong [Catholicism](http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa-regio2.php?c2=society&map%5B%5D=&map%5B%5D=&map%5B%5D=&map%5B%5D=&map%5B%5D=300&map%5B%5D=&map%5B%5D=&button=), convictions that humans should rule over the world are higher.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.5.1.2. Con: In countries with strong Catholic beliefs, the belief that the current treatment of the earth will lead to an [ecological catastrophe](http://www.atlasofeuropeanvalues.eu/new/europa-regio2.php?c2=society&map%5B%5D=&map%5B%5D=&map%5B%5D=&map%5B%5D=&map%5B%5D=301&map%5B%5D=&map%5B%5D=&button=) is the lowest.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Progressive Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Christianity) critically emphasizes the same issues as progressive movements.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Human Rights discourses were influenced by the Church and their teachings.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: As early as the 19th century, [Pope Leo XIII](http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2011-07/23-13/The_Church_and_Human_Rights.pdf) was already highlighting the need for properly protecting human rights.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.2. Con: The Church teaches that a person can demand complete respect for his fundamental rights only when he conscientiously respects the [duties](http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2011-07/23-13/The_Church_and_Human_Rights.pdf) which such rights imply. This runs counter the idea that human rights are universal.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: The Church laid ground for this interpretation in the [Pacem in Terris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacem_in_terris) where it highlighted the [connection](http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2011-07/23-13/The_Church_and_Human_Rights.pdf) between rights and duties.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.3. Pro: The [teachings](http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2011-07/23-13/The_Church_and_Human_Rights.pdf) of the Church emphasize that the state has a [positive obligation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_obligations) to protect Human Rights.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.4. Pro: The Church constantly [points out](http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2011-07/23-13/The_Church_and_Human_Rights.pdf) cases where Human Rights are systemically violated and thus creates momentum that civil society actors can exploit for promotional purposes.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.5. Pro: The enclyclica [Pacem in Terris](http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2011-07/23-13/The_Church_and_Human_Rights.pdf) of 1963 highlights religious liberty leads to freedom of expression, assembly and thought. These are the core values of Human Rights NGOs as well.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.6. Pro: Many Human Rights NGOs are affiliated with the Church and motivated by it.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.6.1. Pro: The [Churches' Commission for Migrants in Europe](http://www.ccme.be/who-we-are/) is associated with Christian thinking in the promotion of Human Rights for migrants.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.6.2. Pro: Churches are efficient providers of humanitarian aid.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.6.2.1. Pro: Churches have access to a large, decentralized and local network of churches that can serve the efficient provision of humanitarian assistance.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.6.2.2. Con: Having a religious affiliation puts humanitarian programs at risk of being disrupted by being [discredited or attacked](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129155780&t=1535451013956) for their religious stance.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.6.2.2.1. Pro: The Christian charity Save The Children had its offices attacked in [Afghanistan](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42800271).
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.6.2.2.2. Pro: A consultant who produces the database for [Aid Worker Security Database](http://Aid Worker Security Database) claimed that although there is no clear indication that faith-based organizations have been disproportionately singled out, it is "reasonable to assume that organizations with a clear Christian identity face an additional layer of vulnerability" referring to Christian aid work in Muslim nations.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.6.2.3. Pro: Religious organizations encourage private donations and thus have access to more funds for conducting and promoting their work.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.6.3. Pro: [CIDSE](http://www.cidse.org/) is supported by the Pope and advocating that the only hope of avoiding catastrophic warming of the earth requires [radical](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/catholic-organisations-call-lifestyle-chages-environment-pope-francis) economic and political change
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.7. Pro: Christian teachings led to the secure affirmation of the world having the human person with all their rights [as its center](http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2011-07/23-13/The_Church_and_Human_Rights.pdf), especially those of Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas \(p. 16\).
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.8. Pro: Christian teachings stress that a [transformation](http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2011-07/23-13/The_Church_and_Human_Rights.pdf) of social, economic and political structures is needed for the protection of Human Rights. This is in line with the analysis by activists that violations are inherent in the current system.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: Peace movements have been inspired by the idea that humans are responsible to preserve each other as representation of God's creation.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.7.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: The encyclical [Pacem in Terris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacem_in_terris) was a motivation and justification for Christians to seek peace.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.3. Pro: [Pope Pius XII](http://www.clerus.org/clerus/dati/2011-07/23-13/The_Church_and_Human_Rights.pdf) called for the establishment of an international body to oversee peace, akin to the UN that was later established.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.3.1. Con: With the [League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations), there was already a predecessor to the UN. The call by the pope during WWII can hardly be considered inspiring.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.4. Con: In times of war, churches provided the necessary ideological legitimation to convince soldiers that the war was worth dying in.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Christianity promoted the just war doctrine.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: A just war doctrine can be found in Christian thought from old [ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory#Just_War_Doctrine) to the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.4.1.2. Pro: In 1917, Cardinal [James Gibbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_war_theory#World_War_I) of Baltimore promoted the war against Germany in the US as just war.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.4.2. Pro: It was not before Pacem in Terris that the Church spoke of objectors and limits to the [arms race](http://www.crisismagazine.com/1982/catholics-and-the-peace-movement).
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.5. Con: There are [military chaplans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_chaplain#Roman_Catholic_Church) that directly support the soldiers and therewith help to kill.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6. Con: Christian teachings brought people in Europe up against each other throughout the 20th century.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.1. Pro: Northern Ireland saw a confessional conflict that cost more than 3000 [lives](http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/troubles/troubles_stats.html).
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.2. Pro: In Cyprus, Christianity was a major factor that led to the divide between Turkish Muslims and Greek Orthodox in the [Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_intercommunal_violence).
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.3. Pro: The [German Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Christians) were a pressure group that aimed to align Protestantism as a whole with Nazism.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.4. Pro: Christian institutions played an important role in making World War I happen.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.4.1. Pro: Christian images were used in war [propaganda](http://www.writers.warpoetry.co.uk/readers/christianity-and-the-first-world-war).
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.4.2. Con: In Australia [conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I#Conscription) was opposed by the Catholic Church.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.4.3. Pro: Christians were mobilized to [support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-JwdcYAok) the troops at the front in the US.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.4.4. Pro: Bertrand Russel argues that the First World War was wholly Christian in [origin](https://books.google.de/books?id=pc0x2bxOSUgC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=%22the+First+World+War+was+wholly+Christian+in+origin%22&source=bl&ots=ZiUq8ZfFzm&sig=VBIblsMQcbFy_1qDqScosqx7G1c&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0m-iZ6NbLAhVn6aYKHWG_BV4Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22the%20First%20World%20War%20was%20wholly%20Christian%20in%20origin%22&f=false) because all leaders were devout Catholics or Orthodox who always had been at odds with each other.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.4.5. Pro: [Rudolf Bultmann](http://www.maxfieldbooks.com/WorldWar1.html#bultmann) argues that Christianity gave its endorsements of that national culture's war because it was part of culture and must speak prophetically to it.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.5.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.5. Con: To see unborn babies as God's creation inspires churches to agitate against abortion.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.2. Pro: Marx suggests that the promise of God's foresight is [opium of the people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_of_the_people) because it creates illusions that prevent the sight on what needs to be done.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.3. Con: Catholic teaching emphasizes that the divine is mediated. God does not act directly in the world but in and through the [humans](https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ctsa/article/download/3520/3113). Thus, human beings must accept full responsibility for their actions.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: The [manuals of theology](https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ctsa/article/download/3520/3113), a guide book for priests, stressed the role of individual responsibility.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.4. Con: In the 20th century, academic discourse transformed the concept of divine providence into a more [neoliberal](https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ctsa/article/download/3520/3113) one of non-intervention in which God creates the ground for self-actualizing freedom.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.5. Con: Since the [Holocaust](https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ctsa/article/download/3520/3113) many Europeans do not believe in practical divine providence anymore.
1.4.2.8.2.1.1.6. Con: God's intervention will not take place because God's [love](http://file:///C:/Users/Gregor/Downloads/3520-6266-1-SM%20\(3\).pdf) is the actual intervention. There is nothing more to expect.
1.4.2.8.2.2. Con: The Second Vatican Council was merely a reaction to changes in time and by no means a revolutionary development for society at large.
1.4.2.8.2.2.1. Pro: Vatican II opened up the Church to non-ordinal [female roles](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ZBZNXBWqdgEC&pg=PA322&dq=%22Catholic+Church%22+lay+women&hl=en&ei=YE4LTvDMOcvbiAKq_-jjAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Catholic%20Church%22%20lay%20women&f=false). A fact that had been established in most European societies already.
1.4.2.8.2.2.2. Con: Changes, like vernacular language sermons, were not occurring in society before.
1.4.2.8.2.2.3. Pro: Vatican II [embraced](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/oct/11/second-vatical-council-50-years-catholicism) many things that were condemned by prior Popes.
1.4.2.8.2.2.4. Con: The call for [active](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/11/vatican-ii-catholic-church-changes_n_1956641.html) mass participation of people was not widespread by the early 1960s.
1.4.2.8.2.2.5. Pro: Pope John called for Vatican II out of an urgency of [Aggiornamento](http://vatican2voice.org/2need/need.htm), which functions as an acknowledgment that the Church needs to adapt to changes in the world.
1.4.2.8.2.2.6. Con: There was no crisis that required to interpret the totality of the faith. The last time this happened after the emergence of Protestantism at the [Council of Trent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent).
1.4.2.8.2.2.6.1. Con: The advent of modernity triggered the [First Vatican Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Vatican_Council) which was unable to conclude. Together these two represent the answer to modernity just as in Trent the answer to Protestantism was developed.
1.4.2.8.2.2.6.2. Pro: The announcement by Pope John XXIII to hold the council came as a [surprise](https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3854495381/fifty-years-of-reaction-and-reform-american-catholicism) to observers and clergymen alike.
1.4.2.8.2.2.7. Pro: The [Life](https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3854495381/fifty-years-of-reaction-and-reform-american-catholicism) magazine in its 1963 story labelled Vatican II as an attempt to move that "huge old galleon back into the mainstream of world history".
1.4.2.8.2.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.6.
1.4.2.8.2.4. Pro: It [redefined](http://www.glowm.com/section_view/item/375) the Church as God's people; not as a flock obedient to a master.
1.4.2.8.2.5. Pro: It accepted the notion of mutual love in [marriage](http://www.glowm.com/section_view/item/375) reforming the former picture of a union of procreation.
1.4.2.8.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.6.9.
1.4.2.8.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.6.11.
1.4.2.8.2.8. Pro: The Vatican Council boosted [liberation theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology) that centers on the poor.
1.4.2.8.2.9. Pro: Vatican II was interpreted as demanding to remain [open for dialog](http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=15126).
1.4.2.8.2.10. Pro: The discourse about the [Spirit of Vatican II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_Vatican_II) was enriching as it constantly pressured the Church to remain modern in its teachings.
1.4.2.9. Con: Many early 20th century Christian figures, leaders and thinkers [shaped the early development](http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/philosophy/human-rights-religion-christianity-philosophy-theology) of human rights theory and protections.
1.4.2.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.3.1.
1.4.2.10. Con: -> See 1.4.2.7.3.
1.4.3. Pro: Christian [guilt](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#LatPerWri188188) significantly impoverishes people's quality of life by burdening human's conscience.
1.4.3.1. Con: Catholics know they can escape their guilt by confessing their sins. This gives them continuous hope, which does not exist for non-Catholics with feelings of guilt.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: One cannot conclude that non-Christians are precluded from hope simply because Christians can escape guilt through repentance.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: There are [ways](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/how-to-find-hope-when-you-are.html) to find hope other than religion.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Christians, who take matters of conscience seriously, are prone to find reasons to feel guilt where there are none.
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Christians are said to be born with the [original sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin) and therefore need to feel guilty from the start.
1.4.3.3. Con: Although guilt can make people feel bad, it might reduce overall suffering by enforcing moral behavior internally.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: The suffering of feeling guilt makes you less likely to commit harmful actions again.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: Moral behavior exists in all societies, regardless of religion or lack thereof. Humans are social people and succeed better when cooperating. Christian claims that the bible commandments are the ones keeping people moral are just empty claims.
1.4.3.4. Con: Romans 8:1 Says that there should be no *condemnation* for those who belong to Christ Jesus. So guilt should not be a burden.
1.4.3.4.1. Pro: Jesus says in Matthew 11:28-30: Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart; and you will find rest. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
1.4.4. Pro: Christian theology led to Christian fundamentalism.
1.4.4.1. Con: Fundamental movements are closely related to [modernity](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=DSiphJBtWmQC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=Fundamentalism,+Sectarianism,+and+Revolution&source=bl&ots=34s9ku2-PU&sig=Nh2579ZROqNN0FoGLlSJIvS4HcY&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjovOrg6OHLAhXBFaYKHRGxAcQQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&q&f=false) and therefore not a creation of Christian theology which is much older.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Fundamentalists create highly elaborate ideologies that are part of the modern political agenda working against the [enlightenment](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=DSiphJBtWmQC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=Fundamentalism,+Sectarianism,+and+Revolution&source=bl&ots=34s9ku2-PU&sig=Nh2579ZROqNN0FoGLlSJIvS4HcY&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjovOrg6OHLAhXBFaYKHRGxAcQQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&q&f=false) discourse.
1.4.4.2. Con: Christian fundamentalism is not necessarily negative.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: The Protestant work ethic furthered the development of [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism).
1.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: Christian commitment influenced European business ethics.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Christian commitment is not different from belief in other [religions](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joseph_Mckinney/publication/226906378_Religious_Intensity_Evangelical_Christianity_and_Business_Ethics_An_Empirical_Study/links/555126a708ae12808b3911f3.pdf). Thus, Christianity itself has no impact.
1.4.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con: There are no other major religions in Europe and therefore it was Christianity who provided for the commitments to business ethics.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: Christianity is beneficial for trusting business partners and thus conducive to commerce.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Usury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury) prohibition socially outlawed making unfair profits by lending money.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Usury prohibition was not applicable in the 20th century anymore.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: [Empirical](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/219/art%253A10.1007%252Fs10551-004-0990-2.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs10551-004-0990-2&token2=exp=1459243613~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F219%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs10551-004-0990-2.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs10551-004-0990-2*~hmac=d855aca8bf281bb87778bd30bfed586792b0fec500a07284358a706d14d1bda9) studies show that a higher religious intensity is positively correlate with more business ethics.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2.3. Con: Christianity was largely [ignored](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1005989824688#page-1) in business management literature during the 20th century.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2.4. Pro: Spirituality enables a person to develop good [moral](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1015721029457#page-1) habits by reducing stress and increasing creativity.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Religion provides a [guarantee](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1015721029457#page-1) for long term spirituality.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2.5. Con: There is no [standard](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/300/art%253A10.1007%252Fs10551-009-0031-2.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs10551-009-0031-2&token2=exp=1459244653~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F300%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs10551-009-0031-2.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs10551-009-0031-2*~hmac=d38e3e2d665bb09c0c16409020f95d6bc8871f038aa15f91f039da0dea2a8154) for moral questions in business. Religion can thus only offer a very specific interpretation that might be wrong.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2.6. Pro: Religiosity is more [influential](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:BUSI.0000025040.41263.09) in inducing ethical behavior than attending ethical management classes at university.
1.4.4.2.1.1.2.7. Con: -> See 1.4.3.3.2.
1.4.4.2.1.1.3. Pro: [Contracts](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03068299810214089) and agreements among partners shall be observed and shall not be nullified except by mutual agreement because violation of an agreement is seen as sin.
1.4.4.2.1.2. Pro: The origins of modern evangelicalism can all be traced back to the Quakers. It was developed by an early captain of consumer capitalism, Henry Parsons Crowell \(founder of Quaker Oats\), who wanted to sell pure Christianity like he sold breakfast. Thus Christian fundamentalism is a [capitalist construct](http://www.salon.com/2015/05/13/christian_fundamentalism_is_a_capitalism_invention_the_secret_history_of_american_religion_partner/).
1.4.4.2.1.2.1. Con: There was Christian fundamentalism before there was capitalism.
1.4.4.2.1.2.1.1. Con: [Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_capitalism) is several hundred years older than [fundamentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_fundamentalism#Origins).
1.4.4.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: The [witch hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt) in Europe and Colonial North America happened between 1450 to 1750 and was inspired by Christian ideology that was deeply fundamentalist in its nature.
1.4.4.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: Christian ideology was so fundamentalist in the 11th century that it inspired the [crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) - military endeavours aimed at subjugating the better part of the Eastern Mediterranean.
1.4.4.2.1.2.2. Pro: [The Fundamentals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fundamentals) evolved as a counter-proposal to modernity in the early 20th century.
1.4.4.2.1.3. Con: Capitalism began in the Catholic Mediterranean, not Protestant North.
1.4.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: [Robertson](https://archive.org/stream/aspectsofriseofe00robe/aspectsofriseofe00robe_djvu.txt) points out that capitalism began to flourish not in Britain, but in pre-Reformation 14th century Italy. Thus Protestantism was not decisive.
1.4.4.2.1.3.2. Con: The main driver of capitalism \(the Industrial Revolution\) emerged in Britain; not in Italy. Widespread capitalism emerged in Europe because of the UK.
1.4.4.2.1.4. Con: Capitalism is an exploitative economic system that has stimulated social inequality, social alienation, overconsumption and ecological destruction.
1.4.4.2.1.5. Con: Capitalism evolved in non-European societies and, thus, it is not the Protestant heritage that created market societies.
1.4.4.2.1.6. Con: Because God is allmighty everything created in this world can be destroyed in a second. This mindset [discourages](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=pmKWuUz4OTgC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) innovation.
1.4.4.2.1.6.1. Con: Protestant work ethic does not state things created in this world are important but that they are a mirror of what will be achieved in afterlife. Thus, the end of the world is irrelevant.
1.4.4.2.1.6.2. Pro: Christianity has treated the end of the world and the Last Judgement with fear instead of hope. This [discourages](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=pmKWuUz4OTgC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) forward looking thinking.
1.4.4.2.1.7. Pro: Christian Protestantism combined the concept of hard work and religion as a life agreeable to God.
1.4.4.2.1.7.1. Pro: [Gerhard Lenski's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Lenski#Sociology_of_religion) 1957 empirical study, testing differences in performance of religious groupings, supports the position of Weber.
1.4.4.2.1.7.1.1. Con: The study was conducted in a city only and thus is not representative for the globe.
1.4.4.2.1.7.2. Con: It was the spread of [literacy](http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=187&Itemid=70) rather than any spiritual orientation that created economic growth.
1.4.4.2.1.7.2.1. Pro: [Becker and Wossmann](https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1366/1/weberLMU.pdf) showed that literacy levels differing in religious areas can sufficiently explain the economic gaps cited by Weber.
1.4.4.2.1.8. Con: Testing the impact of Protestantism on economic growth [Cantoni](https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/14811/1/Cantoni_2013_The_Economic_Effects_of_the_Protestant_Reformation.pdf) found no relation in Germany between 1300 and 1900.
1.4.4.2.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.7.1.
1.4.4.2.1.9. Pro: The way we understand and execute capitalism and market societies \(societies built on the market principle\) is based on those beliefs and bonds those values to the everyday lives of Europeans, no matter what religion they follow if they do so.
1.4.4.2.1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.5.
1.4.4.2.1.10. Con: [Mohammed](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/03068299810214089) equally emphasized the benefits of hard work but this did not quicken capitalism in the Muslim world. Apparently Protestantism is unlikely to be of major importance.
1.4.4.2.1.11. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.1.2.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Throughout the formative years of Christian theology, it evolved to say that violence for God is [allowed and called](http://web.stanford.edu/dept/france-stanford/Conferences/Terror/Buc.pdf) for. This was justified by Christ’s incarnation, passion, and resurrection.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: Jesus' death was not a [ransom](http://www.crosscurrents.org/weaver0701.htm#TEXT2) payment to the devil, as Anselm argues, or to God, as argued by Abelard, and thus needs no retribution.
1.4.4.3.1.1. Pro: The desire for retribution necessarily [leads to more](http://peacetheology.net/salvation/mercy-not-sacrifice-the-bibles-salvation-story/1-violence-as-a-theological-problem/#_ftn5) violence.
1.4.4.4. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.2.
1.4.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.4.4.6. Pro: A group of catholic fundamentalists, the [Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_St._Pius_X#Political_controversies) of St. Pius X, was founded in 1970.
1.4.4.6.1. Pro: The Society of [St. Pius X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_St._Pius_X#Political_controversies) was charged of anti-semitism and some political controversies such as showing support for the restoration of absolutism or the Vichy government.
1.4.5. Con: Theological teachings helped people to orientate and create stability in changing times.
1.4.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.8.2.1.1.
1.4.5.2. Con: The [creation myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth) produces a philosophy of life that disregards truth and therefore should be abolished.
1.4.5.2.1. Pro: The creation myth displays women as of negative influence for convincing Adam to eat the apple.
1.4.5.2.2. Con: Garden Eden as a state of perfect harmony between humans and nature is a desirable goal.
1.4.5.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.1.
1.4.5.2.3. Con: Catholics argue that the 7 days of creation are not speaking a language of science but of [love](http://catholicbridge.com/catholic/catholic_creationism.php). There is thus no need to take them literally.
1.4.5.2.4. Pro: The Catholic Church spreads the idea that earth is not older than [10.000 years](http://catholicbridge.com/catholic/ratzinger_creationism.php#Creation).
1.4.5.3. Con: [Christian eschatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_eschatology), i.e. the idea of future as predetermined, gives Europeans a linear notion of history to follow. This line of thinking leads to many dangers.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: Europeans can be more relaxed about the flow of history and thus will react to external shocks in a more relaxed manner.
1.4.5.3.1.1. Pro: Reacting emotionally instead of with restraint can cause politicians to make grave miscalculations.
1.4.5.3.1.1.1. Con: Fear of pain is a good reaction when thinking about war. It can [prevent war](http://wayback.archive.org/web/20160107193224/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300002211).
1.4.5.3.1.2. Pro: Worrying too much about politics creates stress and frustration among the population.
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.6.2.
1.4.5.3.3. Con: The idea of a certain destination gives stability to people's lives.
1.4.5.3.4. Pro: Believing in Christian eschatology \(such as waiting for the Last Judgement, the Second Coming of Jesus, the Resurrection of the Death, the Apocalypse and Gods Eternal Kingdom\) makes people value everyday life less.
1.4.5.3.4.1. Pro: Believers do not want to shape the present anymore because they are already preparing and waiting for their next lives in the Kingdom of God.
1.4.5.3.4.1.1. Con: There is no obligation to shape society for the individual.
1.4.5.3.4.1.2. Pro: Revolutions \(e.g. the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution) or [Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism)\) would not have happened if the subjects had strictly stuck to Christian teachings.
1.4.5.3.4.1.2.1. Con: The elements inducing revolutions is mostly external, such as no food, rather than coming from within.
1.4.5.3.4.1.3. Con: Believers are incentivised to do good in their lifetime in order to get to heaven in the afterlife. Doing good means shaping the present towards positive ends.
1.4.5.3.4.2. Pro: Old, sick or sad people might decide to opt for suicide to escape life for a better heaven.
1.4.5.3.4.2.1. Con: Christians are mostly against euthanasia and thus they will not opt for suicide to reach heaven.
1.4.5.3.4.2.2. Con: Death by suicide is considered a grave or serious [sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_suicide#Modern_Catholicism) because humans are the property of God in Christian believe. Thus, believers in heaven are very deterred from committing suicide.
1.4.5.3.4.2.2.1. Con: The [Cathechism of the Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_hell#Roman_Catholicism) clarifies that only those go to hell who sin gravely. Violating one of the Ten Commandments only once is thus not a grave sin, but rather equivalent to lying to your parents.
1.4.5.3.4.2.3. Pro: Even though having committed suicide, one can go to heaven if one lived a proper life.
1.4.5.3.4.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.4.2.2.1.
1.4.5.3.4.3. Con: No one knows when the Apocalypse will be and thus Christians can be sure to have to wait until then anyway before going to heaven.
1.4.5.3.4.4. Pro: The belief in hell and damnation has caused a lot of suffering in the past.
1.4.5.3.4.4.1. Pro: People who believe in hell are less [happy](http://www.livescience.com/43606-belief-in-hell-means-less-happiness.html) because it suggests a dark future.
1.4.5.3.4.4.2. Con: The belief in hell and damnation has led many believers to act morally correct, so they would not have to face eternal punishment.
1.4.5.3.4.4.2.1. Pro: The belief in hell lowers [crime](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/19/belief-in-hell-lowers-cri_n_1609247.html) rates.
1.4.5.3.4.4.2.1.1. Con: The belief in [heaven](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/19/belief-in-hell-lowers-cri_n_1609247.html) increases crime rates.
1.4.5.3.4.4.2.2. Con: Despite being strong Catholic believers, members of the Italian Mafia do not act morally correct and lead good lives.
1.4.5.3.4.4.2.2.1. Con: Members of a criminal organization are not strong Catholic believers if they commit crimes.
1.4.5.3.4.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Saying that anyone who commits crimes is not a real Catholic is a circular reasoning - it makes it impossible to determine whether Catholic beliefs actually improve people's morality, since only those with high moral values are considered Catholics.
1.4.5.3.4.4.2.2.2. Con: The Mafia acted according to a certain code of honor that represented moral convictions. Thus, even the Mafia feared to step over certain boundaries.
1.4.5.3.4.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: It is possible to speak of the [10 Gangster Commandements](http://uk.reuters.com/article/oukoe-uk-italy-mafia-idUKL0819930320071108).
1.4.5.3.4.4.3. Pro: The concept of hell and damnation is traumatizing for children.
1.4.5.3.4.4.3.1. Pro: Children believe that for bad deeds done or not worshipping God, they are going to burn in a lake of fire for eternity.
1.4.5.3.4.4.3.2. Pro: [Professor Richard Dawkins](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2312813/Richard-Dawkins-Forcing-religion-children-child-abuse-claims-atheist-professor.html) claims he had been told by a woman that while being abused by a priest was a ‘yucky’ experience, being told as a child that a Protestant friend who died would ‘roast in Hell’ was more distressing.
1.4.5.4. Pro: [Christology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christology) was positive because it gave a symbol of hope to Europeans in times of crisis.
1.4.5.4.1. Pro: The belief in Jesus creates a [positive mindset](http://anitamathias.com/2012/07/27/jesus-positive-thinking-and-mental-health/) that makes people happier and more positive about their lives.
1.4.5.4.2. Pro: The symbol of Jesus represents hope for poor people because he was poor himself.
1.4.5.4.3. Pro: Jesus gave hope to religious people all over Europe for he sacrificed himself to save Christendom.
1.4.5.4.3.1. Pro: The [Jesus movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_movement#Beliefs_and_practices) preached that people can find hope at the minimum in the believe in wonders.
1.4.5.4.3.2. Pro: Jesus is generally cited in sermons.
1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.4.2.7.
1.4.7. Con: Christian beliefs legitimised and strengthened Pacifism in Europe.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Christ did not [participate](http://incommunion.org/2005/08/06/orthodox-christians-and-conscientious-objection/) in any war. The logical answer for a Christian is thus to not participate either.
1.4.7.1.1. Con: There were no wars to participate in during the lifetime of Jesus.
1.4.7.1.2. Pro: One of the central teachings of Jesus in the New Testament is love, even towards [your enemy](http://biblehub.com/luke/6-29.htm). Someone driven by this attitude will not fight in a war and kill humans.
1.4.7.1.2.1. Pro: One of the most famous Jesus quotations from the Gospel according to [Matthew 6:29](http://biblehub.com/luke/6-29.htm) is: "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also."
1.4.7.1.2.1.1. Con: Matthew has to be read in conjunction with [Romans 12:21](http://biblehub.com/romans/12-21.htm) to overcome evil by good. Thus, Jesus preaches that doing good can be a very effective way to win. This does not exclude that at other times it might be necessary to use the sword.
1.4.7.1.2.1.2. Con: Jesus is talking to individuals; not governments. Governments in other parts of the bible are allowed to use force.
1.4.7.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: [Romans 13:3](http://biblehub.com/romans/13-3.htm) grants governments the right to use force to restrain and punish evil.
1.4.7.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Peter 2-13](http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm) reaffirms the government's right to use force.
1.4.7.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: [Proverbs 17-11](http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-11.htm) confirm the punishment for those who contest power.
1.4.7.1.2.1.3. Con: The cheak-slap-metaphor is a teaching about handling [dishonoring insults](http://www.credenda.org/index.php/Exegetica/manhood-and-the-second-slap.html) and not about responding to physical violence or deathful aggressors.
1.4.7.1.2.2. Con: Christian teachings on peace were not very inspiring considering the many wars that were fought by Christians afterwards.
1.4.7.1.2.3. Con: [John 18:36](http://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm) acknowledges indirectly the right of the sword to earthly kingdoms. Jesus just said the earth is not of his concern and thus he will not fight.
1.4.7.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.4.7.1.2.1.2.1.
1.4.7.2. Pro: Christians found a way to serve society by fighting those spiritual forces which make men into enemies, as argued in [Contra Celsum](http://incommunion.org/2005/08/06/orthodox-christians-and-conscientious-objection/).
1.4.7.3. Pro: There are several [saints](http://incommunion.org/2005/08/06/orthodox-christians-and-conscientious-objection/) that were conscientious objectors with reference to their beliefs. They provided a blueprint for Christians opposed to war in the 20th century.
1.4.7.3.1. Con: There were [military saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_saint), including the most important archangel Michael. These are more important than peaceful saints.
1.4.7.4. Con: [Ben Salmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Salmon), a religious conscientious objector, was denounced by the Church as a 'spy' for his refusal to join the military.
1.4.7.5. Pro: There were peaceful churches that were outspoken against war.
1.4.7.5.1. Pro: [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector#Religious_motives) were radical pacifists.
1.4.7.5.2. Pro: During the Second World War [Christadelphians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_pacifism#Christian_pacifist_denominations) were exempted from military service and performed civil work.
1.4.7.5.3. Pro: The [Seventh-day Adventist Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_churches#Churches_of_God_.287th_day.29) from 1914 has a long history of noncombatant service within and outside the military.
1.4.7.6. Con: There were many Christian [soldiers](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2015/december-web-only/why-im-not-conscientious-objector.html).
1.4.7.7. Con: -> See 1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.4.
1.4.7.8. Con: -> See 1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.4.1.
1.4.7.9. Con: Christendom called for war during the crusades.
1.4.8. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.1.
1.4.9. Con: Christian beliefs make people happier.
1.4.9.1. Con: Exorcisms unnecessarily harm sick people.
1.4.9.1.1. Pro: "[Posessions](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-the-devilish-church-practice-of-exorcism-770658.html)" are often undiscovered mental illnesses and by telling the patient that this is their own fault, these people suffer.
1.4.9.1.1.1. Pro: The [success](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism_in_the_Catholic_Church) of an exorcism depends to a great extend on the faith of the exorcist and thus he carries great responsibility for success and failure.
1.4.9.2. Pro: Religious people are generally happier than non-religious people because of social events they take part in.
1.4.9.2.1. Pro: Christians have better [mental health outcomes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2614329/).
1.4.9.2.2. Pro: Christianity provides a purpose in life, which increases people's [satisfaction](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11205-011-9787-8#/page-1).
1.4.9.2.2.1. Pro: Religiosity [predicts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21806304) social support, respect, and purpose or meaning in life, which, in turn, each predict subjective well being.
1.4.9.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.5.3.4.
1.4.9.2.2.3. Con: The purpose of life can be found in many things \(love, family, work, philosophy, other religions\), all of which can increase people's satisfaction with life as well.
1.4.9.2.3. Pro: [Azim Shariff](http://www.livescience.com/43606-belief-in-hell-means-less-happiness.html), an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, argued that social aspects of religion are beneficial for happiness.
1.4.9.2.3.1. Pro: If one belongs to a religion, other members of that religion are likely to provide help in times of need.
1.4.9.2.3.1.1. Con: This may apply to any form of group affiliation, e.g. belonging to a sect, the military, a sports club etc.
1.4.9.2.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.2.2.1.
1.4.9.2.4. Pro: [Attendance](http://news.discovery.com/history/religion/religion-happiness-social-bonds.htm) of religious services matters more than anything besides health in determining how satisfied people are with their lives.
1.4.9.2.4.1. Pro: Between 1972 and 2008, the percentage of [Americans](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21806304) reporting that they were “very happy” ranged from 26% among those never attending religious services to 48% among those attending services more than weekly.
1.4.9.2.4.2. Con: This study also finds that religious people are happier mainly because they make good friends at church. That means that you will be equally happy if you are not religious, but have a lot of good friends.
1.4.9.2.5. Con: In [affluent](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/08/110808170052.htm) societies like 20th century Europe, religion has little influence on happiness.
1.4.9.2.5.1. Con: Europe was not affluent through most of the 20th century.
1.4.9.3. Pro: Christian faith and the belief in God has helped many people in despair or need.
1.4.9.4. Pro: Catholics are less likely to commit [suicide](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/03/study-of-the-day-protestants-may-be-more-suicidal-than-catholics/254547/).
1.4.9.4.1. Con: Suicide is regarded as a sin for which people end up in hell. This reduces the likelihood of suicide, but doesn't mean that Catholics are happier.
1.4.9.4.1.1. Pro: According to the theology of the Roman Catholic Church, suicide is [objectively a sin](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm) which violates the commandment "Thou shalt not kill".
1.4.9.4.1.2. Con: The Catechism of the Catholic Church, Paragraph 2283 states: "We should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who have taken their own lives. By ways known to him alone, God can provide the opportunity for salutary repentance. The Church prays for persons who have taken their own lives." So eventhough committing a sin, [they can be forgiven](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm).
1.4.9.4.1.3. Con: Not committing suicide will make a person happier regardless of the reasons for why suicide was avoided.
1.4.9.4.1.3.1. Con: Not committing suicide extends suffering.
1.4.9.4.2. Con: Suicide is often a result of depression, which is an illness and not the same as unhappiness.
1.4.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.4.9.6. Con: There is no link between Christianity and the [happiness](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022529231234) of German students.
1.4.9.7. Pro: Statistical measurements show that Christians rank very high on the [Happy Planet Index](http://www.christianpost.com/news/christians-among-happiest-faith-groups-non-religious-least-uk-national-statistics-survey-156669/) \(HPI\).
1.4.9.7.1. Con: The HPI is flawed and cannot be used as valid source of data.
1.4.9.7.1.1. Pro: The HPI completely [ignores](http://www.happyplanetindex.org/data/) issues such as political freedom, human rights and labor rights.
1.4.9.7.1.2. Pro: The HPI does not measure individual happiness but the happiness of the planet.
1.4.9.7.1.3. Pro: ‘Happiness’ or ‘life satisfaction’ are very subjective and personal.
1.4.9.7.1.4. Con: The HPI considers the actual ‘ends’ of economic activity in the form of life satisfaction and longevity.
1.4.9.7.1.5. Con: The HPI combines well-being and environmental aspects.
1.4.9.7.1.6. Con: The HPI takes into account people’s well-being and resource use of countries.
1.4.9.8. Pro: Statistics indicate that individuals who become more religious over time record [long term](http://ftp.iza.org/dp3915.pdf) gains in life satisfaction, while those who become less religious record long term losses.
1.4.9.9. Con: -> See 1.4.5.3.4.4.1.
1.4.9.10. Con: -> See 1.4.5.3.4.4.
1.4.9.11. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.4.9.12. Con: Being in Christian environments, which tend to be very homophobic, has a [negative impact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3828207/) on the well-being of gay, lesbian and bisexual youths.
1.4.10. Con: The theology of religious thinkers like Thomas Aquinas or Anselm of Canterbury played an important role in European philosophy.
1.4.10.1. Pro: Aquinas' [aesthetic theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas#cite_note-140), especially the concept of claritas, deeply influenced the literary practice of modernist writer James Joyce, who used to extol Aquinas as being second only to Aristotle among Western philosophers.
1.4.10.1.1. Pro: The influence of Thomas's aesthetics also can be found in the works of the Italian semiotician Umberto Eco, who wrote an essay on aesthetic ideas in Thomas.
1.4.10.2. Pro: Anselm of Canterbury is known in philosophy for discovering and articulating the "[ontological argument](https://www.iep.utm.edu/ont-arg/)", which argues for the existence of an all-knowing God.
1.4.11. Con: In order to promote Bible literacy, Protestans have been leaders in education, which increased levels of literacy and education in Europe.
1.4.11.1. Pro: A strong [link](http://people.soc.cornell.edu/strang/articles/Construction%20of%20the%20First%20Mass%20Education%20Systems.pdf) between state authorities and church organisations was beneficial in the initial stages of mass schooling, but Catholicism was often at odds with state leaders preventing these benefits.
1.4.11.2. Pro: The first mass schooling act was enacted in Protestant [Prussia](http://people.soc.cornell.edu/strang/articles/Construction%20of%20the%20First%20Mass%20Education%20Systems.pdf) in 1763 to 'save the souls" of the people.
1.4.11.3. Con: Primary [enrollment](http://people.soc.cornell.edu/strang/articles/Construction%20of%20the%20First%20Mass%20Education%20Systems.pdf) rates of children in the 1870s show no sign of religious influence. Thus, there can be no effect visible.
1.4.11.4. Pro: Regression results show that Protestantism accounts for [80%](http://people.soc.cornell.edu/strang/articles/Construction%20of%20the%20First%20Mass%20Education%20Systems.pdf) of increases in primary school education in the 1870s and remained influential in the 20th century.
1.4.11.5. Con: Regression results show that the existence of Protestantism prevented the [development](http://people.soc.cornell.edu/strang/articles/Construction%20of%20the%20First%20Mass%20Education%20Systems.pdf) of compulsory education.
1.4.11.6. Pro: [Protestant reformers](http://ftp.iza.org/dp5402.pdf) not only emphasized education based on reading the Bible but also recognized that education was instrumental to the goals of live in a civil society and to be successful in a more material sense.
1.4.11.7. Pro: Protestants score higher than other religions in test [results](http://ftp.iza.org/dp5402.pdf).
1.4.11.8. Con: Mass schooling was driven by the establishment of nation states irrespective of denomination.
1.4.11.8.1. Pro: There was mass schooling in Catholic countries and areas, such as [Bavaria](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ntiSWpd6fQoC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=mass+schooling+bavaria&source=bl&ots=qE02ACcRhX&sig=d0Z2Iul7WXYC7Bdd88C9EyFuzFU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjL9v7CxOrLAhXFKqYKHQ-ZAm0Q6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&q=mass%20schooling%20bavaria&f=false) or [Italy](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1502768?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).
1.4.12. Con: The centrality of Christ within Christianity made him a potential positive male [role model](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/21-life-lessons-even-non-christians-can-learn-from-jesus.html) for members of the religion.
1.4.12.1. Pro: [Tactics](http://speakoutloud.net/intimate-partner-abuse/male-perpetrators-domestic-violence/mens-tactics), such as power or mind games, used by men to exert power are not usable for devoted persons.
1.4.12.2. Con: Jesus was abusive to others and exerted [violence](http://www.realclearreligion.org/articles/2014/04/30/the_myth_of_a_non-violent_jesus.html).
1.4.12.2.1. Pro: He violently expelled traders from the temple.
1.4.12.2.1.1. Con: He used a makeshift "whip," made out of twine, to more effectively drive cattle and other animals out of an enclosed space.
1.4.12.2.2. Con: Jesus might have been acting [aggressively](http://reknew.org/2014/05/was-jesus-violent-in-the-temple/) but not in a violent way.
1.4.12.3. Con: [Luther](http://www.realclearreligion.org/articles/2014/04/30/the_myth_of_a_non-violent_jesus.html) argued that the Bible teaches violence.
1.4.12.4. Con: Many devoted Christians committed crimes and acted violently.
1.4.12.5. Pro: The [conversations](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=SIlMop6JJDEC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=men+learning+from+jesus&source=bl&ots=gj35uR592t&sig=rxhb3mCCkC618gM0iWsRiyVQk-4&hl=ko&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiV9KLbl-rLAhUjI6YKHZA-CXs4ChDoAQgiMAE#v=onepage&q&f=false) of Jesus with women show that men need to take women as equals.
1.4.13. Con: Praying has positive effects on health.
1.4.13.1. Pro: Even scientists agree that [praying](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-195741/Why-praying-good-medicine.html) can help sick people recover.
1.4.13.2. Pro: Praying relieves [stress](http://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/10-ways-praying-actually-benefits-your-health-p114/).
1.4.13.3. Pro: Praying reduces the chances of suffering from [depression](http://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/10-ways-praying-actually-benefits-your-health-p114/) and anxiety.
1.4.13.4. Pro: Praying increases [immunity](http://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/10-ways-praying-actually-benefits-your-health-p114/) and keeps illness away.
1.4.13.5. Pro: Praying helps the [heart](http://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/10-ways-praying-actually-benefits-your-health-p114/).
1.4.13.5.1. Con: There is no scientific evidence of an actual effect on health of the heart. The article in the claim is pseudo-scientific, quoting only itself and referencing other non-scientific sources.
1.4.13.6. Con: Christianity is [not necessary](http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2014/09/30/pray-divine-guidance-atheist-sam-harris-spirituality/34287) to pray.
1.4.14. Con: Certain teachings that the New Testament promotes actually encourage the [tolerance](http://www.religioustolerance.org/tol_bibl.htm) of opposing views or lifestyles which is something Jesus and his apostles touch on often.
1.4.14.1. Pro: This teaching is beneficial not just to Christians but to all within society.
1.5. Con: It was the advances of science and technology that made life better for Europeans in the 20th century, not Christianity.
1.5.1. Con: The advance of science also brought a lot of troubles to Europe, it is not merely something that made life better.
1.5.1.1. Con: Given a choice, most people would rather not live during the 20th century.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Given the massive leaps that have been made in technology, human rights, welfare, and general security, it appears difficult to believe that many would make the choice to live in the 20th century instead when thinking through the consequences.
1.5.1.2. Pro: During [WWI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I#Technology), advancements in science and technology led to creations of tools which made it easier to harm and kill other humans, such as the machine gun, the tank, bombs and mustard gas.
1.5.2. Pro: Thanks to medical and technological advances, [life expectancy](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/37013/umfrage/ranking-der-top-20-exportlaender-weltweit/) in Europe increased dramatically in the 20st century. For example, the life expectancy in Germany 1905 was 45,5 years while in 2015 it was 80,8 years.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Advancements in [knowledge of sanitation](https://www.nature.com/scitable/content/life-expectancy-around-the-world-has-increased-19786) in medical centers and daily life contributed greatly to this.
1.5.2.2. Pro: The discovery of antibiotics [revolutionized](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5354621/) healthcare and dramatically contributed to this rise in life expectancy.
1.5.2.3. Pro: [Blood banks](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/g1577/7-surprising-scientific-advances-that-came-out-of-world-war-i/) were only created during the 1st World War and have saved many lives.
1.5.2.4. Pro: The technology used in [ultrasounds](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/g1577/7-surprising-scientific-advances-that-came-out-of-world-war-i/), which are now essential for monitoring of internal organs and prenatal care, was developed from submarine technology discovered during WW1.
1.5.3. Pro: Advancements in technology lead to cheaper food and products raising the average quality of life across Europe.
1.5.3.1. Pro: [The Haber process](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/g1577/7-surprising-scientific-advances-that-came-out-of-world-war-i/), discovered under the pressure of WW1, has allowed for farming process with exponentially larger yields. This has made food cheaper across Europe and the world.
1.5.4. Pro: Advancements in technology lead to better modes of transportation which made the world more interconnected.
1.5.4.1. Pro: [Commercial airlines](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/g1577/7-surprising-scientific-advances-that-came-out-of-world-war-i/) have made travel easy and Europe more interconnected.
1.5.4.2. Pro: The development of the Automobile, largely due to the development of synthetic rubber during WW1, has made local transportation much easier.
1.5.5. Con: Both science and Christianity could have had a positive impact on Europe. There is no single reason for the wellbeing of humanity.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.
1.7. Con: Christianity made life much worse for European Jews in the 20th century as it enabled the rise of antisemitism.
1.7.1. Pro: Christianity was used as an excuse to justify Antisemitism.
1.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.4.6.4.1.
1.7.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.4.4.1.1.2.
1.7.2. Con: Christianity did not give precedence to Antisemitism. Jesus was, himself, a Hebrew. It was mainly Hitler and Mussolini who played on Antisemitism.
1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.
1.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.4.
1.7.4. Con: Ordinary Catholics did a lot to support Jews during World War II [\(p.xi\)](http://www2.dsu.nodak.edu/users/dmeier/23461117-The-Catholic-Church-and-the-Holocaust.pdf).
1.7.4.1. Pro: The [108 Martyrs of World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/108_Martyrs_of_World_War_II) chose death over subjugation in occupied Poland.
