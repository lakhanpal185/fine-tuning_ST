Discussion Title: People who do immoral things aren't immoral

1. People who do immoral things aren't immoral
1.1. Pro: The perception of someone as continually and irreversibly immoral precludes the possibility of their change past a certain point life.
1.2. Pro: Once one does an immoral thing their continuing existence does not guarantee more immoral acts.

1.3. Con: If you commit a crime, you''re a criminal. If you commit an immoral act, you are, by definition, an immoral person.
1.4. Pro: Believing that people are immoral leads to tons of anger, shame, violence, and suicide
1.4.1. Pro: Populations that are deemed immoral commit suicide at a higher rate than other non-stigmatized populations.
1.4.2. Con: This is the appealing to consequences of belief fallacy. The outcome of a particular belief neither supports or negates the belief itself.

1.5. Con: People who do bad things ought to be locked up in jail
1.5.1. Con: Not all bad things deserve punishment by imprisonment

1.6. Con: Criminals are likely to act again
1.7. Con: People are able to control themselves. People who are unable to stop themselves from doing bad things must be immoral.

1.7.2. Pro: A key feature of an immoral act is the will to commit such an act.

1.7.3.1. Con: Ignorance is not a valid excuse when making moral decisions
