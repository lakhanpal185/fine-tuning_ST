Discussion Title: Is Creatine for Bodybuilding Overrated?

1. Creatine Is A Good Product For Bodybuilders To Use
1.1. Con: Creatine causes [cramping](https://www.livestrong.com/article/392259-creatine-and-muscle-cramps/).
1.1.1. Con: A very comprehensive study involving 1500 athletes showed the exact opposite; creatine usage actually decreases instances of muscle cramping during high intensity weight training and athletics.
1.2. Con: Creatine is a steroid.
1.2.1. Con: Anabolic steroids are synthetic variants of the hormone testosterone. Creatine is a combination of three amino acids and is a 100% legal, over the counter dietary supplement. To suggest that creatine and steroids are similar in any way is downright absurd.
1.3. Con: You have to take a certain amount a day - the loading phase - otherwise you will not see results.
1.3.1. Con: One of the most studied integrator and one of the fewest with proven effect. It's safe to take for long term \(depending on dose\). The action is in 'buffer mode' , i.e. it doesn't care if taken pre or post workout , but at any time of the day is the same.
1.3.2. Con: This in untrue; while it may take longer fully saturate creatine stores without a loading phase, it will still happen.
1.3.3. Con: This is true of many pills or supplements, it is rare to have an instant effect.
1.4. Pro: You can get in different flavours and it tastes good.
1.4.1. Con: Sugar also tastes good; but the reason for creatine is 1\) an aesthetic 2\) for health purposes, or 3\) for weight lifting results. Flavor is inconsequential.
1.4.2. Con: The flavour is highly debatable.
1.5. Pro: It is amazing to use as a pre-workout, since it gives you more energy and strength.
1.5.1. Con: Creatine causes dehydration \(by pulling more water into muscle cells\), which prohibits many kinds of athletic exercise.
1.5.1.1. Con: This effect is minimal and [doesn't cause dehydration](https://www.livestrong.com/article/537544-does-creatine-dehydrate-your-body/) if the user is drinking sufficiently.
1.5.2. Pro: This has been [proven repeatedly](https://www.myprotein.com/thezone/supplements/the-best-time-to-take-creatine-before-or-after-workout/) to be true.
1.6. Pro: It expands your [muscle cell volume](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/vm15.htm).
1.6.1. Con: You could get addicted to the muscle growth.
1.7. Pro: It helps you retain muscle during a cut.
1.7.1. Con: You lose muscle mass once you stop taking in creatine.
1.7.1.1. Con: Water weight is shed after cutting creatine supplements from the diet; muscle mass is retained.
1.8. Pro: [It’s safe](https://www.maxinutrition.com/nutrition/ingredients/creatine/Is-creatine-safe/) in both the short and long term.
1.8.1. Con: You have to stop taking it after a few weeks or a month.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Usually this is six months or so, but can be cycled according to need and to allow the body to recover.
1.8.2. Con: Creatine is [potentially harmful](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-873/creatine) to the kidneys and liver.
1.8.2.1. Pro: It raises the risk of [kidney stones](https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/kidney-stoneproof-diet-5528.html).
1.8.2.2. Pro: Over six months of usage shows a dramatically higher risk of [liver damage](https://www.livestrong.com/article/541027-does-creatine-affect-the-liver/).
1.8.3. Pro: Creatine is the most heavily studied bodybuilding compound out there and has [never been shown](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/creatine-safety-and-side-effects) to have any adverse effects on human health. Creatine usage is safe and effective in both the short and long term, and no evidence has ever suggested otherwise.
1.9. Pro: It’s inexpensive.
1.10. Con: Creatine causes [bloating](https://www.livestrong.com/article/474725-does-creatine-make-you-bloated/).
1.10.1. Con: This side-effect, if it occurs, can be easier combatted.
