Discussion Title: Equal paternity/maternity paid leave should be mandatory.

1. Equal paternity/maternity paid leave should be mandatory.
1.1. Pro: Men and women no longer have radically separated roles in present society, so the law should treat fathers and mothers in the same way.
1.2. Con: It should be a family matter, to decide who or when a parent should go on paternity/maternity leave - the government shouldn't engage in personal/private matters.
1.3. Pro: This would mean equality of genders in the workplace.
1.3.1. Pro: Women would be less likely to be rejected when applying for jobs during prime child bearing age.
1.3.2. Pro: This would close the gender pay gap as maternity leave is one of the main causing factors for this. As females are on maternity leave looking after children because males don't get as much time off, he can work his way further up the ladder. On her return she is lower than he is. Give males the opportunity for the same amount of time off and watch the gap close.
1.4. Con: There is a risk of absenteeism from fathers.
1.4.1. Con: Fathers have the same right as mothers to spend time with their children.
1.5. Pro: This would mean greater recognition of parental responsibilities for men.
1.6. Con: It is difficult to enforce when paternity isn't fully known.
1.6.1. Con: In such cases, paternity leave can be granted to the de facto parent rather than the biological parent.
1.7. Pro: Same sex couples would receive better support.
1.8. Pro: Men would be more invested in their family lives.
1.8.1. Con: This unfairly assumes that fathers who have to go to work are less invested in their family lives.
1.9. Con: Employers are unlikely to embrace the change.
1.9.1. Con: If it is enforced, then it makes little difference whether or not employers embrace the change; they will have to do it regardless.
