Discussion Title: Can Climate Change Be Reversed?

1. Climate change can be reversed.
1.1. Pro: Societal advancements \(technological, cultural...\) divert humans from contributing to climate change in the process and towards reversing it instead.
1.1.1. Pro: The world is transitioning away from the industrial age and towards a technological age where unlimited products could be produced without using resources \(a.k.a. [post-scarcity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klQ7bb8bBsQ)\). Combined with removing the damage and sources of it, a net negative impact could provide a reversal.
1.1.1.1. Con: [Scientists have discovered that a lot of the byproducts of our burning of fossil fuels](https://e360.yale.edu/features/air-pollutions-upside-a-brake-on-global-warming) -- namely aerosols -- are actually having a cooling effect on the environment.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Some aerosols, however, are clear and remove protective layers from the atmosphere \(such as [CFCs and the ozone layer](http://theozonehole.com/cfc.htm)\), so those would increase the radiation sent to Earth instead of keep it away.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Aerosols might block out light, but the light that does stay gets trapped and accumulates. That is why the temperature trend is a rise instead of a fall. Remove the aerosols and the world can cool.
1.1.2. Pro: As people start to leave Earth and colonize space \(such as [Mars](https://www.kialo.com/argument/2495.1)\), less resources will be taken from it. Then Earth will be given the opportunity to heal.
1.1.2.1. Pro: If anything, space mining \(such as asteroids\) could reduce the need to mine Earth. This is beneficial as [mining is a massive consumer of the world's water supply](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/wateruse-diagrams.html).
1.1.2.2. Con: There is no indication that us leaving Earth would make a difference in climate change. The reason is that the Earth's temperature is influenced by non-human factors.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The earth have been the "victim" of climate changes way before the humans and might have more way after. More science research is needed to "predict" the future of climate change if we leave.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: The climate change that was started by humans will still continue regardless of whether humans are on Earth or not \(because the temperature-rising factors are already set in motion: like ice melting\).
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: If people leave Earth then they will not give themselves a chance to potentially reverse its effects.
1.1.2.2.4. Con: Humans are the biggest influence on climate change at the moment and them leaving is best for Earth's future.
1.1.2.2.4.1. Con: More research should be done to see if people leaving Earth will make an impact on climate change. Humans might be the biggest influence now but the consequences of them leaving Earth is not determined. The claim that it is "best for Earth's future" can't therefore be made.
1.1.2.2.5. Pro: [Climate change was not started by humans](https://www.kialo.com/can-climate-change-be-reversed-8337/8337.0=8337.1+8337.48-8337.57+8337.58).
1.1.2.3. Con: Leaving Earth requires a consequent amount of Earth resources. It might in fact cause more damage than heal.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: To prevent the population from increasing, shuttles would have to continuously remove people from Earth. The continuous shuttling causes a continuous drain on resources.
1.1.2.4. Con: The population that remains on Earth will grow again and reproduce the same scenario as before.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: Any space left on Earth due to someone leaving might be filled by up by a new population.
1.1.2.4.2. Pro: The number of people added to the world is about [a million per day](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).
1.1.3. Pro: Climate change will be reversed once the effects of it wipe out organised consumption based market orientated and pollution causing human society \(leaving behind remnant human populations with a negligible footprint\).
1.1.3.1. Pro: If large scale human activities cease \(ie breakdown of society somehow\), the climate/atmosphere would recover over several centuries.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: This is only valid if humans avoid reaching the "tipping point" and inducing run away climate change.  [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaway_climate_change)
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: A severe drop in human population \(global flu outbreak, 60-80% die\), or halting of current economic system would remove a lot of the man-made harm caused within a relatively-short period on the world's ecological time scale.
1.1.3.2. Con: Climate change is accelerating \(due to [feedback loops](https://www.climatecommunication.org/climate/climate_feedbacks/)\) past what humanity has the technical capacity to control rather than slow down.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: [Positive feedback loops are already well underway](https://www.decodedscience.org/melting-permafrost-arctic-tale-two-feedbacks/57919).
1.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: [Ice \(white/transparent\) reflects sunlight](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=40932) \(as white light reflects and black light absorbs\) out of Earth, which keeps Earth cooler. The more ice melts, the more light gets absorbed and heats Earth \(less white surfaces; earth is less reflective than ice\).
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: One of the reasons that the light absorbs more comes from [beautiful snowflakes melting into goopy-looking ones, which accelerate ice melting in Greenland](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=76916). These new ice crystals make the ice sheet darker \(due to their roundness and clumping together\).
1.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: [Melting permafrost releases carbon and methane \(greenhouse gases\), which traps more heat, causing more permafrost melting/release of greenhouse gases](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/13/methane-release-from-melting-permafrost-could-trigger-dangerous-global-warming).
1.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Plants cannot live in too high of CO2 conditions. Thus, the forests that decrease CO2 levels would instead go away because of the increase in it, thus causing a loop.
1.1.3.2.1.4. Pro: When ice sheets melt, the water causes glaciers to slide off faster.
1.1.3.2.1.5. Con: As [trees get older, they absorb more CO2](http://science.time.com/2014/01/15/study-shows-older-trees-absorb-more-carbon/) \(which defies prior convention\).
1.1.3.2.1.6. Pro: [More swimming pools](http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/06/19/california-pool-construction-in-drought-could-hit-highest-level-since-2007/) are being built as climate change heats up the Earth.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1. Pro: People swim in the oceans less \(due to climate change\), which [increases the demand for indoor swimming](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319347675_Impact_of_Climate_Change_on_the_Preferred_Season_for_Outdoor_Water_Activities).
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: [Sunscreen chemicals](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-set-to-become-first-state-to-ban-sunscreen-with-chemicals-harmful-to-coral-reefs/) from swimming affect coral reefs.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.2. Pro: Transitioning to swimming pools does not remove the climate-related sources that cause oceans to be difficult to swim in. The action just provides a band-aid and not a solution to the problem.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.3. Pro: Oceanic recreational activities decline.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: [Beaches get eroded](http://www.beachapedia.org/Climate_Change) with climate change. When this happens, people are less likely to go to the beach and swim.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.3.2. Pro: Divers are less likely to [dive without coral reefs](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:axkzlufcnm0J:www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/PDF/sutt3583/sutt3583.pdf+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us), which causes a feedback loop of its own \(the more the ocean acidifies, the people become aware of/take action on the changes - as they partake in less outdoor activities\).
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.3.3. Pro: [Surf breaks go away](http://www.beachapedia.org/Climate_Change) with climate change, removing people's ability to surf.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.3.4. Pro: People [perceive](https://climateinterpreter.org/content/ocean-acidification-effects-humans) that with ocean acidification, the ocean is less possible to swim in.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.3.5. Pro: [Algae blooms](http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-news/scientists-work-predict-and-prevent-algae-blooms) make swimming difficult.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.4. Pro: Toxic and hazardous chemicals are overtaking oceans.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.4.1. Pro: [Plastic](https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/open-water-a-future-of-polluted-swimming/) is taking over oceans.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.4.2. Pro: Some beaches are getting [polluted](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-dirty-dozen-12-most-polluted-beaches-in-the-us-2009-7).
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.4.2.1. Pro: People can get [ill](https://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/open-water-a-future-of-polluted-swimming/) from them.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1.5. Con: These issues are being worked on through various [methods](http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-news/how-you-can-help-ocean).
1.1.3.2.1.6.2. Pro: This is a feedback loop, because construction and maintenance causes the Earth to heat up more. Then, as the Earth heats up more, people's demand for swimming pools goes up.
1.1.3.2.1.6.2.1. Pro: The construction and maintenance requires resources \(concrete, chemicals...\), land \(potentially of forests and reflective sand of beaches\), and water \(which gets strained with global warming\). These contribute to climate change.
1.1.3.2.1.6.2.2. Pro: This is seen in [California](http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/06/19/california-pool-construction-in-drought-could-hit-highest-level-since-2007/), with their drought.
1.1.3.2.1.6.2.3. Pro: Swimming pools cause environmental destruction, especially if they are removed, such as the [one connected to the ocean in Hawaii](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-improbable-technology-of-swimming-pools-built-in-the-ocean/371368/).
1.1.3.2.1.6.2.4. Pro: Swimming pools use lots of water to create \([tens of thousands of gallons](http://www.texasthestateofwater.org/screening/pdf_docs/texas_water_facts/facts3.pdf)\) and more to maintain.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: It is true that many projections are deeply worrying, but we must remember that all projections have margins of error. If we look only at the most severe possibilities, it can cause us to give up trying to decarbonise our energy systems. Let us act as if we have a chance to make things better.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Con: This is positive and will retract some changes, but in the end, it might not work. More people are against than for, causing bigger progress in the negative direction, even with wishful doers.
1.1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Sometimes little actions are enough to lead to bigger actions. "Nipping in the bud" issues helps to prevent them from becoming bigger. If issues are too big, nipping little parts of the whole prevent so much, that this could lead to reversals little seen with no help at all.
1.1.3.2.2.3. Pro: If small actions are taken, they build momentum and support that climb to higher individuals. Sometimes it just takes one person to change \[the mindset of\] the world
1.1.3.2.3. Con: Identifying the specific mechanisms by which those feedback loops operate and breaking them is the key to taking back control of the climate. We start by imposing legal limits on military growth and on consumerism in general. We have to collectively put our foot down and just stop buying 'stuff' ... things that don't actually have real world value, and burning off a tank of gas to go visit an old friend for coffee. the tech is there. it's the using less of it , less often.
1.1.3.2.4. Pro: Not fast enough. The feedback loop has taken new form and scientists now say we have about 20 more years before the situation is not controllable by humankind, but lives its own life. [www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html)
1.1.3.2.5. Con: 'Points of no return' have lost all credibility since they are constantly changing, being pushed out. [Failed Tipping Points](http://www.climatedepot.com/2016/09/21/history-keeps-proving-prophets-of-eco-apocalypse-wrong/)
1.1.3.2.6. Pro: Policy makers have vested interests \(industry money\) to ignore signals of overshoot and straining sinks. Action will be taken too late, and then we will have no way to prevent the feedback loops.
1.1.4. Con: Telecommuting is an underplayed, technological advanced option that could [curb climate change](https://www.lifewire.com/how-telecommuting-is-good-for-the-environment-2378101), if not reverse it. Instead, workers are still forced to actually show up at an office, when it isn't necessary.
1.1.4.1. Pro: This is a denial of climate reality by companies who could [easily remedy this](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2018-02-16/telecommuting-is-growing-but-still-not-unanimously-embraced) situation by implementing telecommuting.
1.1.5. Con: Telecommuting is an option that can help, but is ignored by the workforce by forcing employees to work in office when their job can be done remotely. Therefore, even with technological advancements, humans are not taking full advantage of it to reverse climate change.
1.2. Pro: Sustainable efforts reduce and reverse the global warming trend.
1.2.1. Pro: Restoring wildlife populations can reverse their climate-based damage.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Expanding their native land through better agricultural practices and restoration methods can encourage population growth.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Shunning practices that harm endangered populations help \(such as the exotic pet market\).
1.2.1.3. Pro: Donating to organizations/sanctuaries that help wildlife can help.
1.2.2. Pro: Educating people \(such as making it mandatory in the school system\) on how to reverse climate change can give people the option to make positive changes to the situation.
1.2.3. Pro: People can use biomimicry to discover ideas to collect water, such as [how animals already do so](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/animals-behavior-biology-desert-beetles-lizards-dogs-gibbons-insects/).
1.2.4. Pro: Cultures can adapt to use less resources.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Germany uses [hydrogen \(from water\) to power tour boats](http://earthtechling.com/2012/10/german-river-touring-boat-uses-clean-fuel-cell-technology/).
1.2.4.2. Pro: Veganism grew [500% since 2014](https://www.livekindly.co/demand-vegan-food-140-percent-5-billion-value/).
1.2.4.3. Con: Humanity has long-term difficulties in assessing consequences and mass-transitioning to reverse global warming. Simply greed, convenience, and short-term gain win out over thoughtful preservation of resources.
1.2.4.4. Con: Changing a culture is difficult as people prefer to preserve traditions instead of losing them.
1.2.4.5. Con: Changing a culture is lengthy \(sometimes 1000's of years\), which is too long for this idea to be viable.
1.2.4.6. Pro: A culture can change the mass's actions all at once, which is much better than individual changes.
1.2.4.7. Pro: Cultures can inspire other cultures to adopt the changes once the concept is proven.
1.2.4.8. Pro: Some of these actions produce long-term benefits, especially if they are structural changes.
1.2.4.9. Pro: Once a culture makes a decision, it forces \(in a sense\) everyone else to bend towards that decision or be left out. Then more people will decrease the Earth's temperatures whether or not they agree with that.
1.2.4.10. Pro: Cultural changes requires minimal effort on the individuals end, allowing for a quicker transfer towards sustainability. For example, if a culture decides to change their electricity to renewable sources, people will not need to change their lifestyle at all to experience the new electrical system.
1.2.5. Pro: [Countries generating most of the world's greenhouse gases \(55% combined\) signed the Paris Agreement](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php).
1.2.5.1. Con: The United States, one of the largest emitters, left the Paris Agreement.
1.2.6. Pro: [CO2 can be taken from the air](https://www.fastcompany.com/40421871/this-machine-just-started-sucking-co2-out-of-the-air-to-save-us-from-climate-change) and/or given a new use, which reduces and reverses the greenhouse effects of it.
1.2.6.1. Con: CO2 has been present in the atmosphere for millions of years. It rises after temperature rises, it does not precede global warming. Data exists on this for millennia. The public has been lied to about this issue. It is a scam to get money.  [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi2QKY3zW8Q)
1.2.6.2. Pro: For instance, [Biochar can be used to sequester](https://www.google.com/search?q=biochar+for+carbon+sequestration) unlimited amounts of atmospheric carbon, and it makes good topsoil allowing carbon-neutral desert land to become carbon-negative biochar-producing land, and the "wood liquor" extracted from the biomass could be refined into gasoline. Of course, [ramping up to the point where biochar sequestration is sequestering thirty gigatonnes a year](https://e360.yale.edu/features/refilling_the_carbon_sink_biochars_potential_and_pitfalls) would require massive, distributed, investment, perhaps unification of humanity towards this purpose.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: Biochar is [not the best idea](https://e360.yale.edu/features/refilling_the_carbon_sink_biochars_potential_and_pitfalls) as it involves burning of matter, which requires energy, could possibly larger problems on a large-scale \(where is all the matter going to come from to sustain the practice?\), and takes a lot of effort to get started \(massive plants because no one has built it on a large-scale\).
1.2.6.2.1.1. Con: The [making of biochar](http://www.biochar.info/index.cfm?view=52.2&lan=en) is self feeding because it uses the synthetic gasses that comes off of waste wood as it is being heated in the absence of oxygen. The synthetic gas that is released during the process \(called pyrolysis\), is highly flammable and provides more than enough heat to perpetuate the process \(the extra synthetic gas can be used to generate bio-renewable-electricity\). Since the plan is to use waste wood, it makes sustainable use of forest industry biomass waste.
1.2.6.2.1.2. Pro: Biochar involves the [removal of oxygen](https://permaculturenews.org/2010/11/18/beware-the-biochar-initiative/) from the atmosphere, which is the opposite of what the world needs, especially in times of deforestation.
1.2.6.2.1.3. Pro: A more sustainable effort would be to chip wood and bury it underground, as it uses less resources and steps than biochar.
1.2.6.2.1.4. Con: Chipping wood and burying it underground has no benefit for soils and can actually be detrimental for plants as it robs nitrogen from soil.   Conversion of waste forest products into biochar for soil enhancement has long term soil benefits, which include drought tolerance.  Carbon captured from the atmosphere through photosynthesis that is buried in this manner is resilient to decomposition and is therefore considered by the UNFCCC as a method of both climate change mitigation and adaptation.
1.2.6.2.1.5. Con: The making of biochar does not consume oxygen... it is a pyrolysis process that is performed in the absence of or near absence of oxygen and therefor does not involve "burning" or results in very little "burning" of wood.  Moreover, the introduction of biochar into soils actually increases plant productivity, which contributes to more production of oxygen through the process of photosynthesis.  All good for the planet's atmosphere.
1.2.6.2.2. Con: Biochar is not necessary if plant matter for it is used instead as ground cover to protect topsoil from losing CO2.
1.2.6.2.3. Pro: [Biochar is an excellent method of carbon sequestration.](http://www.airterra.ca)
1.2.6.2.4. Con: Biochar could create issues if not done correctly. Proactive measures should be taken to avoid these issues, otherwise biochar efforts may become counterproductive.
1.2.6.2.4.1. Pro: Biochar could create air pollutants, like [PAHs and dioxins](http://biochar.international/the-biochar-opportunity/biochar-production-and-by-products/), if heated at too high of temperatures.
1.2.6.2.4.2. Pro: Not all biochars are equal, as [some are more productive than others](https://e360.yale.edu/features/as_uses_of_biochar_expand_climate_benefits_still_uncertain). Some biochars may be counterproductive if they take more effort to make than use.
1.2.6.2.4.3. Con: Clearly, we are in an early state, and so biochar needs to be carefully researched and developed.
1.2.6.3. Pro: Emmission certificates or new laws may help to reduce CO2 emission.
1.2.6.4. Pro: [Bhutan is a carbon-negative country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lc_dlVrg5M) and hopes to help others succeed as well towards this.
1.2.6.5. Pro: [Atmospheric CO2 can be used to synthesize proteins for human consumption](https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/protein-powder-made-from-microbes-electricity-co2-water.htm). This could reduce the massive CO2 amounts generated by agriculture by not needing to grow food.
1.2.6.6. Pro: [No-till farming](http://www.aksik.org/sites/default/files/media/image/2017-04/ag-conv-call-out-posters-Final_Page_1.jpg) could prevent CO2 loss in topsoil that plants directly put there from the air.
1.2.6.7. Pro: Some [materials absorb 1,000 times more CO2 than trees](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-08-30/artificial-tree-part-solution-climate-change-these-guys-think-so) and could become artificial trees themselves.
1.2.7. Pro: Some measures to combat climate change actively promote human and environmental health.
1.2.7.1. Pro: For instance, walking and cycling instead of using the car promotes health by increasing exercise and reducing air pollution.
1.2.7.2. Pro: Eating more vegetables and less meat will promote health and reduce our greenhouse emissions.
1.2.8. Pro: Small changes in consumers behavior have a great impact on the actual free market economy and will force big corporation to shift to the new consumers trends
1.2.9. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.4.
1.2.10. Pro: [Space-based solar power](https://energy.gov/articles/space-based-solar-power) could provide 24/7 energy to anyone in the world.
1.2.10.1. Con: These technologies would likely not be operational soon enough to prevent irreversible climate change.
1.2.11. Con: All we can do is reduce our impact but not reverse it. The pros under [there](https://www.kialo.com/can-climate-change-be-reversed-8337/8337.0=8337.1-8337.29) shows that.
1.2.11.1. Con: Paradoxically, we must hope that there is some degree of truth in the claims of the climate contrarians.
1.3. Pro: Humanity is increasingly capable of controlling our entire planet. Climate change is a symptom of developing this ability without being aware of it. As we increase our awareness and capacity to control all the Earth's systems, climate will be among the first priorities that we can reliably alter to suit our needs.
1.3.1. Pro: Humans are, in fact, quickly learning methods of positively impacting climate for the better.  More effort is needed to raise this awareness amongst Earth's near 8 billion humans.  Sites like this one will have a better chance of accomplishing this.[www.soilmatrix.ca](http://www.soilmatrix.ca)
1.3.1.1. Con: Even if was true that humans are quickly learning methods to potentially reduce their carbon footprint, the extent to which many have to change their lifestyles discourage many from taking the methods into practice.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Oil, for instance, is by all denominators the most effective energy resource we have, and it is difficult and will take a long time to try to become independent from it and completely substitute it and other fossil fuels with renewable energy sources.
1.3.2. Con: Though humanity has proven itself capable of utilizing natural resources and controlling how much they take out and how they use these resources, the market's demand for energy cannot be as easily controlled, and this demand restricts how much fossil fuels can be controlled as it's reduction below the demand would lead to economic and political instability. For demand of energy to change, people's lives and habits would need to change, which is very difficult to make people do.
1.3.2.1. Con: Market forces are already at work as solar energy technologies prices fall. Once renewable energy is cheaper than fossil carbon, renewable provision will increase greatly.
1.3.3. Con: Humanity is nowhere near close to controlling our entire planet. We can control tiny things. We cannot yet control hurricianes, tornados, volcanos, earth quakes, the oceans, melting sea ice, nor the entire weather system
1.4. Con: The Sun is getting bigger and hotter every year. The Earth will eventually \(in about 1 billion years \([1](https://phys.org/news/2015-02-sun-wont-die-billion-years.html), [2](https://usm.maine.edu/planet/sun-getting-hotter-if-so-why-will-earth-eventually-become-too-hot-life)\)\) [be too hot to live on before this trend gets reversed \(when the Sun becomes a white dwarf that eventually burns out\)](https://www.universetoday.com/18847/life-of-the-sun/).
1.4.1. Con: The probability is that the human species has gone extinct within a billion years \(About 1/14 of the current age of the universe\), and if they haven't, they have most likely already developed the technology to travel beyond the solar system to an earth-like planet somewhere else, which has a different star than the sun, thus making the heat of the sun irrelevant for our survival.
1.4.2. Con: this is irrelevant to man-made global warming
1.4.2.1. Pro: Man-made climate change is occurring faster and before any natural climate change takes over.
1.5. Pro: The operative principle is "If you are in a hole, stop digging". In climate terms, this means first, stop adding to the CO2 in the air. This requires first, energy conservation, second, a big transition to renewable energy, and third, development of means to sequester CO2 from the air. Challenging, but possible, given the political will.
1.5.1. Pro: Energy conservation will create much new work which will pay for itself in energy cost savings.
1.5.2. Pro: Renewable energy requires a completely new, very extensive industry around energy storage.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Modes of energy storage include \(1\) Potential energy \(water and solids \(2\) thermal \(e.g. molten salt\) \(3\) hydrogen \(4\) compressed gas.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.2.
1.5.4. Pro: Far reaching changes to the way we run our economy and society will be required to put us on a sustainable path.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The economic changes required for sustainability are based on three axioms: \(1\) It is impossible to expand forever into a finite space \(2\) it is impossible to take forever from a finite resource \(3\) everything on the surface of Earth is interconnected.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Societal changes require everyone to cooperate, at every level of society: Individual, family, community, business, Government, nations and international institutions.
1.5.5. Pro: The simplest way of capturing and storing CO2 is to plant trees. Not only do they capture CO2, but also they cool our cities, provide their own microclimate and even create rain clouds, provide us with forage for some of our animals, wood for our structures \(new trees can grow in the places that old ones have been felled\), provide food and medicines and finally they nurture our spirits.
1.5.6. Pro: New technologies are also coming on stream that can capture and fix gaseous CO2.
1.5.7. Pro: Ocean fertilisation by adding iron and other nutrients can produce blooms of phytoplankton that can capture CO2, but it needs to be carefully researched so that the blooms form in places where down-welling will take them to the deep ocean.
1.5.8. Con: I would argue that, yes it possible in a thought experiment. But no in reality. What force could persuade all the upcoming people of the world to agree to a lesser way of life and all the governments such a Russia to stop their main export of selling oil for "the benefit of the global society"? This is whishfull thinking with no basis in political nor monetary reality.
1.6. Con: The cause of climate change is the combination of the human attempt to control the environment through artifice and the twin explosions of population and improved quality of life; we cannot reverse climate change because we cannot decide to quickly starve everyone of the benefits of industrial production while using the diverted and declining resources to create sustainable systems.
1.7. Con: Statistics and trends are showing that [climate change is irreversible](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99888903).
1.7.1. Con: Greenhouse gasses were drastically higher when the dinosaurs walked, and earth survived just fine. Climate change can always be reversed, the question is simply how much effort over what period of time.
1.7.1.1. Con: Earth survived, but the dinosaurs didn't. Interestingly, climate change from one or another cause may have played a part in the dinosaur extinction. [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous–Paleogene_extinction_event)
1.7.2. Con: The author of the linked report says "I guess if it's irreversible, to me it seems all the more reason you might want to do something about it," she says. "Because committing to something that you can't back out of seems to me like a step that you'd want to take even more carefully than something you thought you could reverse."
1.7.3. Con: A change of lifestyle, society, and massive tree planting can reverse climate change.
1.7.4. Pro: The Earth's temperatures will continue to rise. At the very least the rate will [level off but never go down](https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-07/scenariotempgraph_0.jpg).
1.7.5. Con: The reversal of the climate change cannot be posited without first proving that it can be done. With a system this vast, affecting the entire ecosystem, it is impossible to determine the correct course of action. We do not yet have the technology nor the thorough research to determine a\) how exactly the climate change happened and ergo b\) how to reverse or overtake the effects back to the established norm for the planet \(pre-industrial atmosphere? etc.\)
1.7.6. Pro: Certain activities are creating even higher demands on resources than ever before.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Fracking releases methane into the atmosphere, a greenhouse gas that is [86 times worse than CO2 at trapping heat](https://thinkprogress.org/methane-leaks-erase-climate-benefit-of-fracked-gas-countless-studies-find-8b060b2b395d/).
1.7.6.2. Pro: Cryptocurrencies demand tacks onto current electricity usages. For example, [Bitcoin uses as much energy as Denmark](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/bitcoins-insane-energy-consumption-explained/)
1.7.6.3. Pro: The world's population is increasing, creating an even greater demand on resources. This is accelerating global warming, not slowing it down.
1.7.6.3.1. Con: The millennial generation is having less children than generations before \([past the 'replacement level'](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/millennials-say-no-to-kids-population-replacement-level-turns-negative/article/2640743)\)
1.7.7. Pro: More Amazon Rainforest is destroyed every year \([20k sq. mi.](http://www.rain-tree.com/facts.htm)\) than is recovered \([9k sq. mi.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rainforests/tropical-rainforests-are-regrowing-now-what-idUSTRE50B5CY20090112)\). At this rate, the rainforest will not recover fast enough to reverse the damage.
1.7.7.1. Con: We can plant much more trees.
1.7.8. Pro: The biodiversity loss cannot be recovered if animals go extinct. If an animal is unknown without their DNA documented somewhere.
1.7.8.1. Con: If animals are able to [adapt quickly to rising global temperatures](https://theconversation.com/how-australias-animals-and-plants-are-changing-to-keep-up-with-the-climate-74247) then they will be able to recover when climate change is reversed.
1.7.8.2. Pro: [Evolution cannot keep up with climate change](https://gizmodo.com/evolution-can-t-keep-up-to-the-blistering-pace-of-clima-1789302795).
1.7.9. Con: Physicist [Stephen Hawking](https://futurism.com/stephen-hawking-we-are-close-to-the-tipping-point-where-global-warming-becomes-irreversible/) warns that we are close to the tipping point, but climate change can be reversed if the human race acts now.
1.8. Pro: It may be technically possible to reverse climate change, but it gets harder with every year of weak action.
1.8.1. Pro: Governments around the world need to treat climate change like they treated World War 2, and [repurpose the economy](https://www.theclimatemobilization.org/) to fight climate change.
1.8.1.1. Con: The post-World War 2 situation and the changes were the result of a international trauma \(due to the damages\) and the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers. Due to the slow rise of effects of climate change, such an impact will not be possible for a long time. As for repurposing the economy, it is not linked to the governments interests at this time.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.10. Pro: Changes in the Sun's activity could reverse some of the effects of climate change.
1.10.1. Con: Based on total solar irradiance \(TSI\) [we should be in a cooling period based on the sun's activity](https://www.skepticalscience.com/should_earth_be_cooling.html).
1.10.2. Con: Man-made climate change progresses much faster than changes in Sun activity or distance to the Sun. Human activities would likely reverse any improvements made by the Sun.
1.10.3. Pro: The [Maunder minimum](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/7122/chilly-temperatures-during-the-maunder-minimum) is an example of such times.
1.10.4. Con: Such events are only temporary and rare. The climate issues can come back after the end of those events.
1.10.4.1. Con: People can use these temporary changes in their favor by combining it with their own efforts to tip the scale.
1.10.4.2. Con: Even if "temporary" \(which can be a long time when we are at the scale of the universe\) the climate change would've been reversed. Therefore, yes it can be reversed.
1.11. Con: Under the current economic system \(i.e. capitalism\), it is rational \(and highly likely\) that we will continue to pollute heavily well past the overshoot limits.
1.11.1. Pro: The capitalistic system creates inefficiencies. Negative effects occur due to this, such as unnecessary: resource use, waste, and pollution.
1.11.1.1. Con: Unneccessary waste is not so much due to the market free economy as the government putting restrictions on what they're allowed to sell or not.
1.11.1.2. Con: A market free economy is built on what the consumers want, so the "unneccessary" pollution is in that case mostly due to the consumers wanting stuff that requires "unneccessary" pollution. Same with "unneccessary" resource use.
1.11.2. Pro: The supply and demand system makes suppliers guess at what people want instead of actually making what they want. Products get made that should not and products that should be made do not exist, leading to waste and inabilities for people to combat their personal effects on the environment.
1.11.2.1. Con: This is not how the supply and demand system works. Entrepreneurs and workers don't "guess" what people want, they look at the market's [price signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_signal) function of money, which signals increases and decreases in supply and demand, and produce more of what is more demanded and less of what is less. They try to offer the market a product, and if people don't want it, they won't buy it, and the company will go bankrupt unless the government bails it out. Companies who doesn't make what they want die.
1.11.2.2. Pro: If a company makes a product that no one wants, then that product \(along with the resources to make the product\) go to waste \(with the exception of recycling, repurposing...\)
1.11.3. Pro: Advertisements create an interest for items that use resources that they do not need.
1.11.4. Con: Artificial scarcity makes people buy less of products.
1.11.4.1. Con: Artificial scarcity does not take away the fact that there might be stores of a product that are not released to consumers. The destruction is already done before the artificial scarcity is created.
1.11.5. Pro: The disposable economy leads to two issues: 1\) people buy new items instead of replacing a part because of the product's design to prevent this, 2\) people keep throwing away items after use instead of reusing them. Gillette's business model is based on this concept.
1.11.6. Pro: Companies sometime push people over profits, which devastates the ecosystem past what it can recover.
1.11.7. Pro: Since companies are not incentivized to conserve \(except through consumer demand and resource scarcity\), they do not mind waste as long as they can turn a profit.
1.11.8. Pro: Other economic systems, such as a [resource-based economy](https://www.kialo.com/transitioning-to-a-resource-based-economy-rbe-is-the-most-sustainable-way-for-humanity-to-continue-to-survive-3580/3580.0=3580.1/=3580.1), are better for reversing climate change.
1.11.8.1. Con: In what has been termed the [economic calculation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem), Mises showed \(in his books "Socialism", "Human Action" and others\) that an economic system without money cannot effectively allocate resources, as the [price signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_signal) function of money disappears along with the money itself. They simply have no means of economic calculation of which to use where the resources will go. They will need an incredibly large amount of information to know what will go where, which is unattainable by anyone.
1.11.8.1.1. Pro: Destroying the economy and the ability to effectively allocate resources to "reverse" climate change is not a solution where the means justify the ends.
1.11.8.1.2. Con: It is not that difficult to track demand in other ways. Supermarkets do this when scanning barcodes to track demand. We can easily track demand for goods without money by looking at the sum total use for a product that is being tracked with their barcodes.
1.11.9. Con: [Sixty percent](http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/stakeholder_trends_insights/sustainable_brands/survey_60_americans_resolving_more_env) of Americans are leaning towards a more environmentally friendly lifestyles. Future generations are likely to follow suit in greater numbers.
1.11.10. Con: It is also a rational possibility that the gap in overshoot limits will narrow. As seen with the [Clean Air Act](https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/progress-cleaning-air-and-improving-peoples-health#pollution), pollution has lessened as the US economy has grown.
1.11.10.1. Con: Even though it is an improvement, most of the issues with greenhouse gases/pollutants stem from CO2 and methane. Neither of which are addressed.
1.11.10.1.1. Pro: Looking at chemical reactions, [Hess's Law for methane](http://slideplayer.com/slide/6231387/20/images/12/Hess%E2%80%99s+Law+Problem+Example+1.jpg) produces the greenhouse gases water vapor and CO2.
1.11.10.1.2. Pro: Another reaction shows how CO2 mixes with water to make [carbonic acid](http://www.21stcentech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Carbonic-Acid-ocean.jpg), which is what causes ocean acidification.
1.11.10.2. Con: The Clean Air Act does not make sense, since it cannot, in essence, get rid of all greenhouse gases without causing harm. With the [O3 + CO -\> CO2 + O2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/j100655a002) equation, the Clean Air Act may be the cause of rising CO2 levels, as it focuses on the equation's 1st half and neglects the 2nd half. Neither side is a win-win. O3 helps/CO harms vs O2 helps/CO2 harms. The 2nd side is better though, as it removes an extra greenhouse gas and nourishes plants/humans.
1.11.11. Con: Many people feel unsure about the idea of radically changing the economy *before* we can start reducing fossil fuel use. Better to reduce fossil fuels and in the process of doing that, free market fundamentalism may wither away.
1.11.12. Con: If Capitalism is defined as the private ownership of the means of production for profit, is it being argued here that the means of production must be owned by the State before we can hope to reduce GHG emmissions?
1.11.13. Pro: If by Capitalism we mean free-market mega-capitalism, where multi-national corporations are free of any legal, ethical or environmental constraints, then the above claim is true.
1.11.14. Con: Taxing processes that produce CO2, and giving tax breaks to processes that save energy and remove carbon from the air \(e.g. planting trees\) is simple and effective. All that is needed is the political will.
1.11.15. Pro: The tragedy of the commons is being played out on a global scale. The individual incentive of countries around the world is to allow their citizens and businesses to continue to exceed greenhouse gas emissions targets. The lack of a strong international enforcement mechanism ensures that individual countries will not be willing to incur costs to address climate change.
