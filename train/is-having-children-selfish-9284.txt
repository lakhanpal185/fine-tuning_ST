Discussion Title: Is Having Children Selfish?

1. Having a Child is Selfish.
1.1. Con: Having a child involves considerable sacrifice on the part of parents. It is a more selfless than selfish decision.
1.1.1. Con: Since the subject in question would not exist at this point, it is impossible to consent to this suffering before birth. It is immoral to force any agent into a situation they did not consent to.
1.1.1.1. Con: It is not immoral to override someone's consent if it produces outcomes which are on the whole good.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Using another person, especially without their consent, to improve the world in which you live in is selfish and immoral.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: There are very few ways to improve the world directly. If somebody believes they can raise a child in such a way as they could give what the parents could not, that may be one of the only ways those individuals have to give back to the world.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: Not being psychic, there is no guarantee whatsoever that a child will contribute 'good' outcomes for society. As such, it is immoral - and selfish - to override consent on the offchance of later benefit.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: It could be suggested that it was a selfish act for the parents of evildoers to have children, which is absurd: you can't know the future.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: You can't know the future for certain, but you do know that through your actions as a parent you can help instill your child with an attitude and traits that will make the world a better place, or vice versa.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This seems to imply that parenting is the primary reasons for criminal behaviour, when in reality, there are a host of other notable factors that lead to criminality.
1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: No parent can predict what their child will do or be. Many parents are [absolutely horrified](http://gulfnews.com/news/asia/india/husband-killer-parents-disown-daughter-1.2141499) at the behaviour of their criminal offspring.
1.1.1.2. Con: It is also impossible for an agent to consent to non-existence. This suggests that the concept of consent is meaningless before an agent actually exists.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: It is preferable to allow someone to exist and be able to influence their circumstances rather than not exist and have no control whatsoever.
1.1.1.3. Con: When somebody is born, they possess the capacity to consent to existence by choosing to remain alive. If an agent truly no longer consented to existence, they could choose to end their life.
1.1.1.3.1. Con: This would still require the child to go through years of suffering before they made the decision to take their own life, not to mention that they must take the incredibly difficult, and often painful, step of committing suicide.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Between [92-95%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attempt) of suicide attempts fail. Killing oneself is not a simple nor easy process.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: One can not want to live, but also find suicide incredibly hard to commit. Saying one can choose to end their life is easy, while actually ending life is often an incredibly difficult step to take.
1.1.1.3.2. Con: People can choose to live not because they have a good life, but because they don't want to hurt those around them. The child suffers, but chooses to continue to suffer for the sake of others. To put someone in that position is selfish.
1.1.1.3.3. Con: In a world where euthanasia, assisted suicide, and even suicide itself [is illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation) or heavily stigmatised in various places, it is not a simple act to end one's life, even if the individual might desperately wish to.
1.1.1.3.4. Con: The fact that they have the option to end their life latter on should they choose to no longer consent into existence does not mitigate the harm caused by bringing them into the world when they have no way to consent.
1.1.2. Con: By deriving benefit from having children, parents make a selfish decision as the decision is ultimately for themselves rather than the child.
1.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Some parents have children so they can live vicariously through them. They force their children into dance, sports, cheerleading, etc. because they failed to succeed at these things themselves and want their progeny to succeed in their place, which is selfish.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: '[Pushy parenting](http://time.com/4242212/pushy-parenting/)' leaves children prone to substance abuse, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic illnesses and a wide host of other problems.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Wishing your children to be successful where you failed, to improve on your experiences and learn from your mistakes, is a very human desire. Nobody wants to see their children fail. Although pushing a child may seem misguided, it can be born out of a genuine desire to see them successful and happy, rather than a selfish urge.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Regardless of the motivations behind a parent's behaviour, if the result of their behaviour is negative for their child, it is selfish of them to expose their child to that behaviour.
1.1.2.2.3. Pro: People should not be treated as a means to an end, but an end unto themselves.
1.1.2.2.4. Con: It may be fair to say that having children for this purpose is a selfish act. However that does not reflect on the selfishness inherent to having children. It is perfectly possible to have children and not live vicariously through them.
1.1.2.3. Pro: This planet may well be unable to support human life long enough for babies that have just been born to live into old age. The decision to bring more people onto the planet is short-sighted and selfish.
1.1.2.3.1. Con: A child need not live into old age for their life to have been worth living. Life satisfaction first peaks at just [23.](https://www.sciencealert.com/here-are-the-ages-you-peak-at-everything-throughout-life)
1.1.2.3.2. Con: It is possible that humans may become an [extra-terrestrial species](https://owlcation.com/stem/human-space-travel) within the lifetime of a child born today. The survival of this planet is not a required for children born today to reach old age.
1.1.2.4. Con: This is true of any interpersonal relationships; individuals derive benefit from friends, family, lovers. It is not any more selfish to have children than it is to have close friends, if the condition is 'deriving benefit'.
1.1.2.5. Con: To derive benefit from having children does not make the act selfish, rather the intention by which the parents had children determines the selfishness of the decision.
1.1.2.5.1. Pro: [Arguably](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201203/does-true-altruism-exist), there is no such thing as a selfless good deed.
1.1.2.6. Pro: In many developing countries, parents have children to [support them in old age.](https://hbr.org/1993/01/third-world-families-at-work-child-labor-or-child-care)
1.1.2.6.1. Con: This is true worldwide; it is not a compulsion, but rather, children who love their parents wish to take care of them. In addition, most cultures have a strong sense of duty towards elders. To expect one's child to care for one in old age is not selfish, but an understood norm, much like it is expected that a parent will care for a child while they need it.
1.1.2.6.1.1. Con: The fact that care from your children is a socially accepted norm in most cultures does not mitigate any selfishness involved in expecting that from them.
1.1.2.6.2. Con: It takes a lot of sacrifice and work on the part of a parent to ensure their child lives long enough to be a caregiver, especially in developing countries. Indeed, the [maternal mortality rate](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/) in developing countries means that childbirth could well be fatal, somewhat undermining the idea that having a child is 'selfish'.
1.1.2.6.3. Con: A child has free will. If they do not wish to care for their parents in their old age - when it is unlikely that said parents will be in a place to object - then they have the choice not to.
1.1.2.6.3.1. Con: The obligation a child often feels to their parents for the care they have given them through their life means that their free will to refuse care is compromised.
1.1.2.6.3.2. Con: It is not only financial, but often emotional or physical support, which can utterly take over a person's life; it is deeply selfish to prevent a child having their own life because their parents need them.
1.1.2.6.4. Pro: A person bringing a child into the world to cement their own financial future is a selfish act.
1.1.2.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.3.
1.1.2.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.6.3.2.
1.1.2.7. Pro: There is a common [social narrative](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/many-parents-will-say-kids-made-them-happier-they-re-probably-lying-a7124851.html) that claims having a child will make a person happier and make them complete. Having a child to fulfill this narrative is selfish.
1.1.2.7.1. Pro: Some couples may have children just so that it would [save](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/romance-redux/201101/how-kids-can-save-your-marriage) their otherwise crumbling marriage.
1.1.2.7.1.1. Pro: The most problematic element is that this does not always work, and then a child is left in the middle of a broken family, implicitly blamed for not being able to reunite the parents. This is deeply unfair on a child, and very selfish on the part of parents.
1.1.2.7.1.2. Pro: Creating a human being in order to attempt to affect another interpersonal relationship is inherently selfish and immoral.
1.1.2.7.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.3.
1.1.2.7.2. Con: That narrative is often associated with the belief that having children is a selfless and giving act. Individuals who want to act in that way should not be derided as selfish for the influence of a narrative that they have little to no control over.
1.1.3. Pro: The act of childbirth is a huge sacrifice. Women undergo huge physical and mental changes, require continuous medical supervision, have to have time away from work, and experience excruciating pain, and all before the child is born. If it is selfish, it is a very high price to pay.
1.1.4. Pro: In 2016, the average cost of raising a child in the UK was [£231,843](https://www.nationwide.co.uk/guides/news/articles/2016/06/cost-of-raising-a-child). The amount of work and sacrifice that is put into earning that amount of money and the fact that parents could otherwise have spent it on themselves indicates how selfless a choice is.
1.1.5. Pro: For many parents, having a child involves giving up the best years of their lives, which they could be devoting to themselves, to look after children that are completely dependent upon them. This is clearly inherently selfless.
1.1.6. Con: Whether something is selfless is not determined solely by the amount of sacrifice it requires, but also by the benefit you get from it. For example, raising a fortune may involve considerable sacrifice and still be a selfish endevour.
1.1.6.1. Con: Parents do not know if they are going to benefit from having a child when they choose to have one. They take on great risk to bring another person into a world. It therefore is not analogous to building a fortune because the benefits are not guaranteed and another actor is the prime beneficiary of the action.
1.1.6.2. Con: By this logic, all actions are selfish unless they accrue harm to the person who undertakes them. Therefore, donating to charity, helping people and being kind are all selfish actions. It is clearly an unreasonable metric for selfishness.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: Everything a human does can be considered selfish. Even Mother Theresa helped the poor because she felt personal satisfaction in the process.  Selfishness drives our species and children are the extension of our quest.
1.1.7. Con: Many adults have a bias when viewing child-rearing. Focusing on the benefits while ignoring the costs. Just because child-rearing is grueling and generally does not make one happier does not mean it was a selfless decision since it could have been made on false assumptions and information.
1.2. Pro: Life will always be sad and painful. It is selfish to put children through that.
1.2.1. Con: The vast majority of lives will also contain great joy, and giving anybody the opportunity to experience this is a gift.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Pain and sadness, like any emotions, are fundamentally transient. Except in the case of mental health problems - which may make the proportional time being sad or in pain longer or shorter - humans experience a hugely broad variety of emotions, with sufficient positive emotions to balance out the negative.
1.2.1.2. Con: No matter how much joy a person experiences in life, they are guaranteed to have negative experiences. Having a child for any reason is guaranteeing they will, at some stage, suffer. Deciding to consciously put a child through that, no matter what joy they may experience, is immoral.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Child abuse is defined as a '[failure to prevent harm](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/studentambassadors/assets/documents/NSPCCDefinitionsandsignsofchildabuse.pdf)'; if individuals having children believe that suffering is more or less compulsory, or inevitable, they are committing an act of abuse by having children.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Moments of sadness and pain are in fact necessary if true joy and happiness is to exist.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Many beliefs include suffering as something that is necessary and an integral part of life. Individuals who believe in those may believe that the suffering their children might go through is what gives life meaning and may not be something that should be avoided altogether.
1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Imposing your own beliefs onto your children is selfish.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Believing that suffering is what gives life meaning only entails that you may welcome suffering into your life, but does not justify your causing suffering to others \(like when you force them into existence\).
1.2.1.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.2.1.3.1.4. Con: Suffering may be integral to life, but that assumes that there is an obligation to create life in the first place, when there is no evidence to support such a claim.
1.2.1.3.1.5. Pro: Suffering and its endurance are an [integral part](https://www.lionsroar.com/what-is-suffering-10-buddhist-teachers-weigh-in/) of Buddhism.
1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Emotional experiences are often relative; without negative experiences as a point of reference, it is difficult to properly appreciate and note the value of positive experiences.
1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Emotional and physical experiences are not relative as their potential is built into the brain from birth. For example, a human will experience the rewarding feeling of eating sweets without ever having felt serious pain. Feelings are inherent and not relative to earlier experiences.
1.2.1.4. Con: [Over 40%](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/happiness-index-only-1-in_n_3354524) of people are unhappy with their lives, with 69% feeling trapped in their routines. Perhaps there are moments of great joy, but the surrounding misery seems more pervasive.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.2.3. Pro: There are numerous issues an individual faces through life. Subjecting a new life to them by giving it existence despite having knowledge of those problems is a selfish act.
1.2.3.1. Pro: While it may be experienced in varying degrees, it is nearly impossible to go through live without experiencing disappointment.
1.2.3.2. Pro: [78% of 11-16 year-olds](http://www.childhoodbereavementnetwork.org.uk/research/key-statistics.aspx) claim to have suffered from the bereavement of a close friend or relative.
1.2.3.3. Pro: [According to a British study,](https://www.benenden.co.uk/newsroom/research/research-archive/study-reveals-the-average-brits-lifetime-of-ailments-sickness-and-injury/) the average person will suffer from 9,672 ailments, sickness and incidents of injury in their lifetime.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: In order for this to be more useful, it should be compared with the average time an individual is healthy or happy.
1.2.3.4. Con: Yet by the same token, individuals have the capacity to experience tremendous joy, love, friendship. Sharing these types of experiences with a child is far from selfish.
1.2.3.5. Con: While life can be disappointing, most people find happiness in it. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate) is some hard data on suicide rate to demonstrate that people are happier being alive than dead.

Wanting to share that happiness is definitely not selfishness.
1.2.4. Pro: All life ends in death. By having a child you expose them to the pain, existential fear and loss of death.
1.2.4.1. Con: If dying can be said to be an inherently bad thing, it is because the person who dies is no longer present in the physical world. Not being born at all presents an equivalent harm at the very least.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Death involves giving up on aspirations that one may not fulfilled during life; these aspirations would never have existed if one was never born.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: Death involves leaving behind loved ones who one would want to spend more time with; these relationships would never have existed if one were never born.
1.2.4.1.3. Con: Is it not dying but the fear of death which is the problem.
1.2.4.2. Con: It is possible that aging and death may be [stopped entirely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoJsr4IwCm4).
1.2.4.3. Con: It also means they won't get the chance to make their life as they want to or make life easier for someone else.

Death is an integral part of life.  Understanding that our time is limited helps us value it and make the best of it.

Also death is a welcomed prospect when one has lived a plentiful life.

Not wanting to live because you're going to die is like not wanting to eat because you'll be hungry again.
1.2.5. Pro: Inflicting this sadness and pain may be justified if there was some greater meaning to life, but ultimately existence is empty and transient, and every life is completely insignificant next to the vast emptiness of the universe. In the absence of any meaning or purpose, inflicting suffering upon children is profoundly cruel.
1.2.5.1. Con: This view is pessimistic. If the parents are optimists, then the act of creating children is not selfish.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: The refusal of the parents to confront the reality of the nature of life is selfish, and therefore the optimistic decisions that this leads to is also selfish.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Not all parents refuse to confront the 'reality' of life; some may have a genuine belief about life being happy, and may want to pass that onto their own children.
1.2.5.2. Con: This statement needs to demonstrate that there is nothing after life or even that life is meaningless. Otherwise it can be taken as a belief and thus not valid.
1.2.5.3. Con: Just because there is no inherent meaning to life does not mean that individuals cannot create their own.
1.2.5.3.1. Pro: The search for meaning itself can be enough of a reason for some to live and bear through the suffering.
1.2.5.3.2. Con: The potential disappointment at the realisation that one's superimposed 'meaning' to life is untrue is likely to be emotionally devastating.
1.2.5.4. Con: Numerous religions and religious individuals hold the belief that there is an inherent meaning to life and that meaning exists regardless of an individual's belief in it. Taking a cynical approach to life does not automatically make that cynicism truth.
1.2.6. Con: Life may be sad and painful, but it is difficult to argue that to not be at all may be better than to be in pain.
1.2.6.1. Pro: As no one has a conscious memory of non-existence, it is impossible to say that non-existence is necessarily preferable to life which almost always has some sort of positive experience.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: It depends on whether 'almost' always is enough, when realistically, negative experiences are equally guaranteed, and may outweigh the positive.
1.2.7. Con: Many parents take great steps to ensure that the suffering in their children's life will be minimized and the joy they receive will be maximised. To those ends they act selflessly for their child.
1.2.7.1. Con: [In the UK alone](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/abuseduringchildhood/findingsfromtheyearendingmarch2016crimesurveyforenglandandwales), 9% of adults aged 16 to 59 had experienced psychological abuse, 7% physical abuse, 7% sexual assault and 8% witnessed domestic violence or abuse in the home. There are too many parents who do not ensure minimal suffering, and this colours the way we should approach whether the act of having children is, overall, selfish.
1.2.8. Con: Life being sad and painful might not be a bad thing so bringing children to this life is not necessarily bad.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Any argument that it is selfish to bring a child into existence because of suffering presupposes a utilitarian view that the moral imperative is to reduce suffering, which is disputable.
1.2.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.2.
1.2.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.
1.2.8.4. Con: Given that global suicide rates have increased [by 60%](https://www.befrienders.org/suicide-statistics) in the last forty-five years, and continues to grow, this seems rather unlikely.
1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.4. Con: On the contrary, not having a child could be seen as selfish because you are hoarding everything you earn to be spent on yourself.
1.4.1. Pro: Having a child is quite [expensive.](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/cost-of-raising-a-child_n_5688179.html) If one has the means to provide for a child but refuses to in order to accrue their wealth for themselves, that is selfish.
1.4.1.1. Con: This appears to imply that wealthier families are obligated to have children, whilst poorer families should not; this is an unfortunate perpetuation of the wealth divide by creating a double standard. Either it is selfish in the absolute, or it is not.
1.4.2. Con: It is not selfish to "hoard" your wealth instead of having a child, if the wealth you have is not enough to comfortably provide for the child.
1.4.3. Con: This assumes that money will be kept for personal gain; it could be spent in charity, on friends, on immediate family, on partners. Children are not the only option.
1.4.3.1. Pro: In fact, the more closely related to the giver the recepient is the less generous the act is. Giving to your own child is more selfish than giving to a total stranger in need, because you get some reward from the first action but none from the second.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Giving a similar resource to ones own child may have proportionally more impact than giving to a stranger in need because there is a greater personal relationship between a parent and child. Leveraging resources where they will make the most difference is not selfish, but rational.
1.4.4. Pro: It is fundamentally self-obsessed to spend your life only focused on your own interests, without the giving-back to society that children form.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Nobody should have to take the responsibility for another couple's bad decisions: to put a child up for adoption is selfish because you are deciding to have a better life for yourself rather than raise a kid.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Putting a child up for adoption can be considered a selfless act if you do it because someone else can give the child a better life than you can.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: It is not selfish to have children as long as you love them and care for them. Putting a child up for adoption is selfish \(depending on the reason\) because the child is always going to wonder why they were left.
1.4.4.1.3. Con: If a parent cannot provide the quality of life they feel their child deserves, it is not selfish to give them up in the hope their quality of life can improve.
1.4.4.2. Con: There are more direct, quick and sure methods of repayment to the society than bringing other entities which need time and effort to be raised just to, in some cases, end up being neutral or even harmful to the society.
1.4.5. Con: Spending one's own money on oneself is not being selfish; it is simply their reward for having worked hard to earn and save up that money. Any obligations the individual may have had to society is paid off through taxes, and they have the right to enjoy the use of their own money.
1.4.5.1. Con: The externalities created by income generation must be taken into account, or global environmental burden, in addition to national, state, or local taxes before one can say their individual obligations are paid.
1.4.6. Con: By not having children, one leaves them without the discomfort of not spending money on them.
1.5. Pro: Having a child is selfish as it places a burden on others in society, one that society has not consented to.
1.5.1. Pro: The average cost of having a child is between [$12,800 - $14,970](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/18/cost-of-raising-a-child_n_5688179.html) a year. Many families cannot afford this, which passes the burden onto the state in many countries.
1.5.1.1. Con: Individuals are the basis for any society so it's not a burden, it's an investment.
1.5.2. Pro: Any state that subsidises healthcare or education will inevitably have to contribute to the resources needed by the child, with each additional child putting more pressure on the system.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The UK spends around [11.7 billion](https://fullfact.org/economy/welfare-budget/) per year on child benefits.
1.5.2.2. Con: The ‘system’ is comprised of people. The system will collapse without more children becoming productive contributors. That is not to say that the system may not be systemically flawed.
1.5.3. Con: When each member of society is also a burden to some degree to others in society, it is illegitimate for them to not accept the burden caused by others.
1.5.4. Con: When living in a country together under one government, everyone consents to paying taxes. This is not selfish, rather just an accepted way of redistributing income that is otherwise distributed unequally due to factors beyond one's control.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Every current adult was once themselves a child and a burden on society. The way that they pay back this debt is by helping to make sure the next generation are supported and have access to the same opportunities they did.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Though it may be a burden initially, most children eventually become adults who contribute back to society in a way that everybody benefits from.
1.5.5. Con: A newborn infant does need societal support or it will die. However, societies inherently strive to expand rather than diminish to zero population; to expand a society, there is a general consensus to do so by having children.
1.5.6. Con: A society \(and humanity generally\) will eventually die out all together without new children being born, and without new workers the structures which support society will also crumble.
1.5.7. Con: While a balance needs to be struck between the population of a society and its resources, consent for new individuals to be born is implicit in any society as new individuals are required for the society's continued existence.
1.5.8. Con: Society has consented. It's legal and fully allowed to have a child. If society doesn't want to consent they could make having children illegal.
1.6. Con: Humanity has a moral obligation to ensure the survival of the human race.
1.6.1. Pro: Moral obligation varies in form and shape, but is found reasonably universally; our moral codes - and perceived obligations - are shaped by society. For as long as society promotes and perpetuates such obligations, individuals will not be able to escape it; it is therefore unfair to label such individuals as 'selfish'.
1.6.1.1. Con: By extension, society may not remain this enamoured of the idea of reproducing; eventually, society will catch up to the realisation that there is no moral obligation to do anything whatsoever, let alone procreate.
1.6.2. Con: The human race is not in any danger of dying out due to lack of people.
1.6.3. Con: It makes no sense to suggest that anybody owes any moral duty to hypothetical people who do not yet exist, and may never exist.
1.6.4. Con: Humanity has no moral obligations, only individuals may have them, and only towards other sentient beings, not towards an abstract concept like a "species". You can say that humans have a moral obligation of not causing harm to other humans, but the "species" is not a person and not even a sentient being, so no moral obligations are warranted towards it.
1.6.4.1. Con: One of humanities most prominent traits is that we organize ourselves in large groups. Even though governments and large coorporation can seem faceless, it does not excuse them of moral responsibility. This is also true of humanity.
1.6.5. Pro: Procreation is a self serving \(selfish\) instinct designed for the survival of our species; yet equally, this instinct created our lives. A position against this selfish act is a position against the creation of life.
1.6.6. Con: It can be argued that humans have a moral obligation to minimise human suffering. The only way to guarantee a person cannot suffer is to not bring them into the world in the first place.
1.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.6.6.2. Con: One of the main reasons that minimising human suffering is important is because it makes happiness and joy very difficult. It is therefore odd to say that our response to this should be to not bring humans into the world at all because that necessarily precludes those things.
1.6.6.2.1. Pro: It is all about balance: human suffering may be unavoidable, but the point is to make the joy outweigh the misery. Hence the aim is to 'minimise' suffering rather than 'obliterate entirely', which would be impossible.
1.6.6.3. Con: It also means not giving an individual the chance to be happy.  Suffering, while uncomfortable, is the best way to bring people together and thus find happiness in company and compassion.
1.6.6.4. Con: Suffering is part of life and is a catalyst for a better understanding of one's surroundings, especially at an early age. The moral obligation to ease it has a certain limit which, if crossed, would render humanity's growth and therefore existence pointless.
1.6.6.4.1. Con: A moral obligation does not cease to be an obligation simply because it nullifies something that one considers key, such as humanity's growth.
1.6.6.4.2. Con: If one is of the opinion that existence is overall pointless anyway, then this is hardly a concern.
1.6.7. Con: To ensure the survival of the human race, we need to ensure the survival of the ecosystem. Our ecosystem would be safer with a human population of 1 billion rather than 7 billion. [interestingengineering.com](https://interestingengineering.com/10-ways-humans-impact-the-environment). The human species is under no threath of extinction even at 10 million globally[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259043612_Minimum_viable_population_sizes_and_global_extinction_risk_are_unrelated). Im not suggesting we shold aim for 10 million, but less than 7 billion.
1.6.8. Pro: Choosing to remain childless is selfish because it ends the family line of so many female ancestors who sacrificed their bodies through the pain of childbirth or even death from childbirth to allow your own life to be possible.
1.7. Pro: Every act is, by nature, egoistic, as each aims to comfort the subject. There is no such thing as "selflessness", since all ever done is to benefit the doer.
1.7.1. Con: Selfishness is seeking only one's benefit at the cost of others.  Seeking one's and others' benefit is not, proportional to the number of people affected.
1.8. Con: Regardless of human motive, science tells us that it's expected of any species to reproduce itself.  Reproduction is a natural and fundamental principle accepted in biology, [here](https://www.britannica.com/science/reproduction-biology) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction) is some basic starting points for further reading.  In that sense, the claim that having children is selfish is strictly false.

From a biological standpoint, procreation benefits the species, not the individual.

The fact that human species tends to be destructive is a different issue.
1.8.1. Con: That doesn't really tell us much. "Selfish" in this context implies "bad" or "morally wrong." And you cannot derive ought from is. So, simply because procreation is "natural" \(infanticide is natural, but that doesn't make it good\) and found in all species, that doesn't make it not selfish; we humans have the ability to reason out our actions and see the consequences in a way that allows us to "go against" instinct, in a sense.
1.9. Pro: Yes. Acting selfishly \(in your rational self interest\) is moral. You do not have an obligation to act for other people. Actions done out of charity, love, and compassion are only meaningful if you choose them - as in you do them because you want to, not because you are categorically obliged to.
1.10. Pro: Humanity is contributing to the death of the planet; having children for your own happiness, at the expense of the planet, is nothing short of selfishness.
1.10.1. Con: Human beings can always just switch planets.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Having children allows humanity to advance scientifically, allowing humans to move to another planet.
1.10.1.2. Con: Putting the burden on a species to develop sustainable environments on other planets instead of refraining from having children is a selfish act.
1.10.1.2.1. Pro: The act of leaving the Earth and populating a new planet is likely to be a profoundly traumatic and difficult experience for all of humanity. It would seem odd to inflict this on ourselves when we could just limit the damage to our own planet by not having children.
1.10.1.3. Con: We do not yet possess the technology to simply switch planets, and it is entirely possible that we never will. Taking this attitude is therefore a massive risk.
1.10.2. Con: This presupposes that there is a value to the planet without humans.
1.10.3. Con: This suggests that because humanity as a whole negatively affects the planet, your individual child will too. If you value protecting the environment greatly, you can bring up your child to have a positive effect on the planet through the way they act.
1.10.3.1. Con: It is surprisingly hard to determine how a child will turn out, especially in this age of technology and exposure to concepts and ideas beyond the control of the parent \(exposure via child's friends and their families, school cohorts and their use of technology, etc.\).
1.10.4. Con: Human beings do not owe a duty to earth.
1.10.4.1. Pro: The Earth is not an agent and is essentially an inanimate object, and it is therefore impossible to hold a duty toward it.
1.10.4.2. Con: Human beings may not owe a duty to the Earth per se, but they do owe a duty of some kind to eco-systems of living things that make up the Earth.
1.10.4.2.1. Pro: We may not recognise animals as agents in the same way we do humans, but we still tend to recognise that they have rights of some kind and acknoweldge principles against animal cruelty. Taking actions that would lead to the extinction of eco-systems would violate these principles.
1.10.4.2.2. Con: Evolution is a cruel mistress. [99% of species](https://curiosity.com/topics/99-percent-of-the-earths-species-are-extinctbut-thats-not-the-worst-of-it-curiosity/) that ever existed are extinct. Ecosystems shift and drastically change from [ice ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age) to [massive](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/11/01/the-asteroid-that-wiped-out-dinosaurs-sent-earth-into-a-multi-year-winter/) extinction level events - without any human influence - with wanton disregard for the species that lived. It only serves to follow that human beings follow the example that nature set and have no regard to the species or ecosystems that exist on earth.
1.10.5. Pro: Humanity is undoubtedly going to be the cause of the next [mass extinction](https://nypost.com/2017/06/01/humans-are-killing-the-planet-and-all-its-inhabitants/); already, all varieties of animal are being wiped out at a rate comparable to the previous five known mass extinctions.
1.10.5.1. Con: Not having children at this point will not stop such an extinction event.
1.10.5.2. Con: [The Holocene Extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction) is unlikely to be the worst extinction event in earth history.
1.10.6. Con: The Earth [is likely](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150323-how-long-will-life-on-earth-last) to die from natural causes before it dies from man-made causes. Our actions are therefore irrelevant.
1.10.7. Pro: [Overpopulation](https://eluxemagazine.com/magazine/human-overpopulation/) is contributing to global warming, scarcity of water and food resources, pollution, and is also proceeding at an alarming rate \(from 1.5 billion to 6 billion in a single century, and another billion in the first decade of the 21st Century\).
1.10.7.1. Con: Overpopulation is not the cause of these issues, but an inefficiency in the [global distribution of resources.](https://www.straight.com/news/david-suzuki-overconsumption-not-overpopulation-biggest-problem)
1.10.7.1.1. Con: Overpopulation and inefficiency are both factors. In all likelihood, the inefficiency will continue. We should try to reduce both, not one or the other.
1.11. Con: There is a religious obligation to have children, as many religions actively promote spreading their faith and raising children into the faith fulfills that.
1.11.1. Pro: Muslims have a religious duty to [increase](http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&Option=FatwaId&Id=90092) their progeny.
1.11.2. Pro: Christians have a duty to be '[fruitful and multiply](http://www.icr.org/article/be-fruitful-multiply/)'.
1.11.3. Con: Believing in religion is a selfish act.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Religion provides the utility of making one's existence meaningful. It also provides answers to the three big W's - where did we come from, why are we here and where will we go. Belief in religion benefits a human being and using that as an excuse to give birth to children is a selfish act.
1.11.3.2. Pro: [Indeed](http://atheistfoundation.org.au/article/religion-equals-selfishness/): "It holds its adherents in a delusional state where reality is contorted leaving them open to the acceptance of being a part of producing pain, suffering and death without remorse." Religion is a delusion, and a crutch for the desperate; it cannot help but be selfish.
1.11.3.3. Con: Religious belief is often influenced by a variety of external and internal factors that are outside of the individual's control. It therefore makes little sense to describe faith as a selfish act.
1.11.3.3.1. Pro: The faith of many religious individuals was constructed by the background in which they grew up and influenced by their parents and communities, just as many other aspects of their personality were.
1.11.3.3.2. Con: An act can be selfish even if it is influenced by external factors. For instance, it is still selfish for a person with little money to steal from others.
1.11.3.4. Con: This assumes that all religions are incorrect. If God truly exists, and belief in him is the morally correct thing to do, then religious belief is not a selfish act.
1.11.4. Pro: An important practice in Islam is [dawah](http://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-about-islam/concept-dawah-spread-islam/), conveying the message of Islam to people.
1.11.5. Pro: The Christian Bible has [several verses](https://www.endtime.com/blog/5-bible-verses-sharing-word-god/) highlighting the importance of spreading the faith among the world.
1.11.5.1. Pro: The branch of Christianity known as the [Mormons](https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-lowers-age-requirement-for-missionary-service) have a well documented dedication to spreading their faith due to their religious text, the Book of Mormon.
1.11.6. Con: Having children to pursue your goal of spreading your own religion is selfish. Doubly so, becuase you are not only creating human beings to advance your own goals, but you are trying to impose your religion on them.
1.11.7. Con: There are [many religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism#In_religions), including some interpretations of Buddhism, which suggest a religious obligation not to pro-create.
1.11.8. Con: For those who are irreligious - [around 10%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism) of the world's population - this is an entirely redundant point.
1.12. Pro: It is selfish to have children when you could adopt.
1.12.1. Con: Families [who adopt](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beyond-blood/201205/stigmas-about-adoption-remain-and-hurt-families), and [adopted children](https://www.adoptivefamilies.com/talking-about-adoption/classmates-say-they-feel-sorry-for-adoptee-adoption-stigma/), face a strong stigma. Not adopting children facilitates a more healthier family with fewer problems arising which is selfless - since an individual isn't just caring about themselves, but the family unit.
1.12.1.1. Pro: This is particularly true for [LGBT couples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_adoption_in_the_United_States), who face difficulties at every stage of adoption.
1.12.1.2. Con: Refusing to adopt a child because having an adopted child makes your family dynamic more complicated is inherently selfish.
1.12.1.2.1. Pro: Prioritising an easier family dynamic over giving a child a family cannot be considered selfless as the parent is putting their wants over the child's needs.
1.12.2. Pro: If everyone decided having children was selfish and decided to adopt instead, the public pressure would make governments improve the adoption process.
1.12.2.1. Pro: Red tape surrounding the adoption process is likely to decrease if adoption is the only means by which families can have children.
1.12.2.2. Pro: It is likely funding would increase, mitigating the current issues caused by the system being underfunded and its employees being overworked.
1.12.2.3. Con: This would only be biologically feasible for a very short period of time as, if everybody decided not to have children, the adoption crisis would end overnight.
1.12.3. Con: Adoption is very different from how it might have been 30+ years ago. Babies are rarely given up for adoption so those children available are often there because they have come from bad situations, often related to drugs or abuse. It's great to give those children a chance but it is far from easy. It's not an easy option and one that should never be taken lightly.
1.12.3.1. Con: Adopting a child you cannot adequately care for is obviously a poor choice for everyone involved, but this does not mean that adoption is an unacceptable choice. If someone has the resources to adopt a child they should do that rather than having a new human who may very well have their own issues.
1.12.4. Con: -> See 1.4.4.1.
1.12.5. Con: Adopting a child means having an adopted child, so in fact it means having a child, which in result makes no difference with the original claim. Keeping an adopted child is as selfish as having a biological one.
1.12.5.1. Con: When adopting a child, that child is not only already in the world \(for better or worse\) but is arguably in a worse position than they would be after they are adopted. The statement here assumes that when people choose to adopt they are still creating a new human, when in reality that is simply not the case.
1.12.6. Con: It is actually [extremely difficult](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2016/11/28/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-adopt-a-child/?utm_term=.fc92aea20567) to adopt a child in many circumstances, and it is just not an option that is realistically open to many potential parents.
1.12.6.1. Pro: For those who wish to adopt from a private agency or internationally, it can [cost](https://www.adoptuskids.org/adoption-and-foster-care/overview/what-does-it-cost) prospective parents anywhere between $5000 and $40,000. This is often an unbearable cost.
1.12.6.2. Pro: There are currently enough prospective parents who wish to adopt in many countries.
1.12.6.2.1. Pro: Estimates [suggest](http://www.americanadoptions.com/pregnant/waiting_adoptive_families) that about two million couples in the US are currently waiting to adopt a child - that means there are as many as 36 couples waiting for every one child who is placed for adoption. Clearly, more than enough people want to adopt.
1.12.6.2.2. Pro: In 2015, in England, there were more people wanting to adopt a child [than there were](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/fatherhood/11729260/Getting-adopted-is-straightforward-as-long-as-youre-a-healthy-white-baby.html) children waiting to be adopted.
1.12.6.3. Pro: Bureaucratic red tape [prevents](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/9698982/Rage-at-the-adoption-red-tape-that-denies-a-child-a-home.html) many from adopting children. The process is either too daunting for prospective parents who drop out, or it leads to deserving parents being rejected for the most tedious of reasons, such as [living on a farm](http://nypost.com/2017/05/24/how-red-tape-leaves-foster-kids-out-in-the-cold/).
1.12.6.4. Pro: Adoption agencies are [underfunded and overworked](http://mtpr.org/post/overworked-underfunded-child-and-family-services-struggles-keep), which leads to high turnover of staff and delays in getting children adopted.
1.12.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.12.1.1.
1.12.6.6. Con: If there are many children awaiting adoption and it is difficult to adopt them, this is an indication that society has given us a bad incentive to easily create new children that may go uncared-for rather than care for the ones that already exist and deserve care.
1.12.7. Pro: Adopting a child is more selfless than conceiving one as many selfish motivators \(knowing a person's genes will continue on, for example\) are removed, leaving behind the selfless elements of dedicating years of their life to nurturing a human being.
1.12.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.12.7.2. Con: Motivators like wishing to pass one's own genes are biological imperatives, rather than a selfish conscious decision. It is wrong to assume that selfish motivators indicate selfish parenthood.
1.12.8. Con: Adoption can be based on selfish reasons too \(I don't want to "destroy my body via pregnancy" for example\).
1.12.9. Con: International adoptions create a vicious incentive for orphanages in third world countries. This [video](https://www.ted.com/talks/tara_winkler_why_we_need_to_end_the_era_of_orphanages/transcript?language=en) makes a case for why these institutions should disappear.
1.12.10. Pro: [Millions of children](https://www.sos-usa.org/our-impact/childrens-statistics) worldwide are lacking basic care, education, love or general welfare. It is selfish to give birth to more children when you could adopt them.
1.12.10.1. Con: Adoption is not the only way to help them. There are people that have their own children and also sponsor education and nourishment of orphans.
1.12.11. Pro: There are over [100,000 children](http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/parenting/a35860/adoption-statistics/) in the US waiting for adoption, and around [72,000 in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664995/SFR50_2017-Children_looked_after_in_England.pdf).
1.12.11.1. Con: Adopted children face [unique difficulties](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/12/adoption-happily-ever-after-myth/418230/) that not all potential parents are equipped to deal with. If parents feel they can give a better life to their own child than to an adopted one, it is not selfish for them to choose to do so.
1.12.11.1.1. Con: Conceiving a new human being instead of giving a better life to an existing one is selfish and unethical.
1.12.11.1.1.1. Con: The parent comment states that parents might not be able to give a better life to adopted children.
1.13. Con: By not having children, the world is deprived of all the good that the child could have done.
1.13.1. Con: More people doing the same amount of good per person, while it may lead to an increase in some kind of quantifiable amount of happiness, suggests that a utilitarian approach to ethics in which more people is better because there will be more good, which is highly disputable.
1.13.2. Con: By having children, the world is now subject to all the evil that a child can do as well.
1.13.3. Pro: Even if a child has difficulties - an appalling start, difficult upbringing, physical or mental health issues - there are plenty of role models in the world who have overcome similar issues, and this has given them a degree of perspective that allows them to give back in a notable way.
1.13.3.1. Con: The small number of children who end up changing the world positively does not outweigh the vast majority of children who are either neutral upholders of the status quo, or harmful to society.
1.13.3.1.1. Pro: It is impossible to determine what contribution any given child will make to the world. Assuming your child is will be one of the few to make a positive contribution to society is simply a justification for a selfish act.
1.13.3.1.2. Con: The parents of a child are in more of a position to influence that child for the better than they are in the case of any other child. Bringing up one's own child positively is the best way for parents to positively influence future generations.
1.13.3.1.3. Con: Changing the world does not necessarily mean seismic shifts, but rather small behaviours and actions; even positively influencing a single person contributes to society in a notable way.
1.13.3.1.4. Con: Individuals who change the world for the better tend to create change far more drastic than those who change it for the worse. For instance a person who invents a new medicine does more good than a person who commits a crime does harm.
1.13.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.3.
1.13.5. Pro: Almost all children eventually develop relationships with those around them which are valued and important to the people involved in them.
1.13.6. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.13.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.13.8. Con: If all, theoretically speaking, will refrain from having children, the situation where there is nobody to experience the lack of said good quickly arises.
1.13.9. Pro: Some countries, including [Japan](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/japan-fertility-crisis-2017-4?r=US&IR=T), are currently experiencing the economic disadvantages resulting from a low fertility rate. Older generations suffer without a young workforce to pay for their retirement and care for their needs. The few young people become burdened by the many old people.
1.13.10. Con: The motivation for having a child can still be selfish even if the child accrues net good for mankind. The externalities of an act do not affect the morality of the original act.
1.13.10.1. Con: Saying that it “can be” does not equal “it is.”
1.13.10.2. Con: An act can be selfish and moral at the same time. Selfishness is not a point on the morality spectrum.
