Discussion Title: Did Trump Collude with Russia?

1. The Trump Campaign Colluded with Russia.
1.1. Pro: Trump's actions indicate someone who is worried about what the investigation will find.
1.1.1. Pro: Trump is under [investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/special-counsel-is-investigating-trump-for-possible-obstruction-of-justice/2017/06/14/9ce02506-5131-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-banner-low_trumpmueller625pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.561eef95e426) by the Special Counsel's office for possible obstruction of justice.
1.1.1.1. Con: Special Counsel Mueller and his team have conflicts of interest that should disqualify them from leading the investigation.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Mueller resigned his membership at Trump National Gulf Club over a [dispute](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) on fees.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This dispute was not because of any political bias and even if it was is nowhere close to a [real conflict of interest](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/conflicts). The misunderstanding was over Mueller not receiving a response to [a letter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-moved-to-fire-mueller-in-june-bringing-white-house-counsel-to-the-brink-of-leaving/2018/01/25/9184a49e-0238-11e8-bb03-722769454f82_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-banner-main_mueller-940pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.a0b3746f648c) requesting a dues refund in accordance with normal club practice, and thus canceling his membership.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Mueller has recently [worked](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) for a law firm that represented Jared Kushner, Trump's son in law.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: This is a loose association that, if anything, should make Mueller biased towards Trump.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: Robert Mueller is a [registered Republican](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/07/30/fbi-nominee-lauded-for-tenacity/e2012e09-379e-479f-8bd3-8c2aef36152a/?utm_term=.ebda3452b753), who was appointed by a Republican president.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Mueller is the [only](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/23/special-counsel-muellers-team-has-only-one-known-republican.html) known registered Republican on the special counsel's team.
1.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: The integrity of the FBI has always been one of its points of pride. They serve the country and the law, not Presidents or administrations. The many attacks leveled at the FBI and other institutions like it appear to be designed to undermine faith in institutions that could stand against a monolithic government.
1.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Donald Trump was praising the FBI until he discovered his campaign was being investigated.
1.1.1.1.3.3. Con: Several of Mueller's prosecutors have [donated](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) to Democrats.
1.1.1.1.3.3.1. Con: People donate to candidates for a variety of reasons.
1.1.1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Most lawyers have donated to Democrats. The predominance of a liberal "elite" in the legal community mean that many lawyers are pressured to pad their resume with [democratic donations](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-bonica-chilton-sen-mueller-investigation-bias-20170728-story.html) in order to boost their likelihood of employment.
1.1.1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: The supreme court can't and doesn't officially consider political affiliation in the hiring process of clerks and yet, since 1960, [70% of the supreme court clerks](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-bonica-chilton-sen-mueller-investigation-bias-20170728-story.html) who have made political donations have leaned to the left.
1.1.1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: President Trump himself has a long history of [donating to Democrats](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/07/28/426888268/donald-trumps-flipping-political-donations). He justifies this as having [advanced his business interests](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-bragged-that-his-money-bought-off-politicians-just-not-this-time/2016/09/07/00a9d1e4-750b-11e6-be4f-3f42f2e5a49e_story.html?utm_term=.f535ff7b9a50) as opposed to being an indicator of his political ideology.
1.1.1.1.3.3.2. Con: Political donations are not considered to be a conflict of interest under the [DOJ's criteria](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/07/20/wary-mueller-trump-team-investigating-his-investigators/P1pZSqUaxY0oesBMCbhrOK/story.html).
1.1.1.1.3.3.3. Con: Mueller could not [legally](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) have considered their political affiliation when hiring them.
1.1.1.1.3.4. Con: There are [many](http://www.newsweek.com/roll-call-republicans-who-oppose-trump-getting-longer-day-heres-list-651310) Republicans who are opposed to Trump.
1.1.1.1.3.4.1. Con: The majority of Republicans tacitly acknowledge Trump as the leader of their party. For example Mitt Romney, once a [vocal](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/romney-trump-utah-senate-endorsement/) Trump critic, recently [accepted](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-voices-support-mitt-romney-campaign-senate/story?id=53208232) his endorsement for his senate campaign.
1.1.1.1.3.4.2. Con: A substantial majority of Republicans \([82 percent](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/07/politics/quinnipiac-monmouth-poll-trump-approval-rate/index.html)\) approve of Trump's performance as president.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: Both Republican and Democratic officials have [affirmed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/17/rare-bipartisan-moment-both-sides-embrace-robert-mueller-special-counsel/101810310/) Mueller's qualifications and integrity.
1.1.1.1.5. Con: The Justice Department has explicit rules about what constitutes a conflict of interest. Prosecutors may not participate in investigations if they have [“a personal or political relationship”](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/07/20/wary-mueller-trump-team-investigating-his-investigators/P1pZSqUaxY0oesBMCbhrOK/story.html) with the subject of the case. Neither Mueller, nor any members of his team, meet this criteria.
1.1.1.1.6. Pro: Comey, the former head of the FBI who was pushed out by Trump, was a friend of Mueller's.
1.1.1.1.6.1. Con: The two men have [never](http://www.newsweek.com/americans-think-mueller-and-comey-are-friends-theyre-not-749168) visited each other's homes or spent much time together outside official business during their time as officials.
1.1.1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.3.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Mueller told Trump’s attorneys the president is directly [under](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-told-trumps-attorneys-the-president-remains-under-investigation-but-is-not-currently-a-criminal-target/2018/04/03/d7832cf0-36c1-11e8-acd5-35eac230e514_story.html?utm_term=.9ea5a3bb4a81) investigation.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Mueller also said that he is [not](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-told-trumps-attorneys-the-president-remains-under-investigation-but-is-not-currently-a-criminal-target/2018/04/03/d7832cf0-36c1-11e8-acd5-35eac230e514_story.html?utm_term=.9ea5a3bb4a81) currently a criminal target.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Trump not being a targeted as a criminal is likely due to the lack of legal clarity over the ability of law enforcement to charge the President of the United States with a crime.
1.1.2. Pro: Trump [ordered](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) Mueller, head of the Counsel, fired. Although his reasons for the order are unclear, they suggest that he is not pleased with the direction the investigation is taking.
1.1.2.1. Con: Trump has [denounced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/business/davos-world-economic-forum-trump.html) this report as "fake news."
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Trump's denunciation lacks evidential support.
1.1.3. Pro: After firing FBI Director James Comey in May of 2017, Trump included the Russia investigation as a reason for the firing. He essentially [confessed](https://www.factcheck.org/2017/05/trump-fire-comey/) to obstruction of justice on national TV.
1.1.3.1. Con: Desiring an end to an investigation is a desire of both innocent and guilty parties alike. The charge that this constitutes obstruction of justice [does not necessarily mean](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/false-cause) there was collusion with Russia.  Obstruction of justice is a separate charge that [may or may not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc) have anything to do with Russian collusion.
1.1.4. Pro: Trump issued two appeals to the Director of National Intelligence and the director of the NSA, in which he asked them to publicly [deny](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-asked-intelligence-chiefs-to-push-back-against-fbi-collusion-probe-after-comey-revealed-its-existence/2017/05/22/394933bc-3f10-11e7-9869-bac8b446820a_story.html?utm_term=.e75342f05e33) that any collusion between his campaign and Russia took place.
1.1.5. Con: Being defensive about being falsely accused is hardly an admission of guilt.
1.1.5.1. Con: Defending oneself with facts would be one thing, but an innocent person would not risk Obstruction of Justice charges by interfering with an investigation. An innocent person would want the investigation to go forward fairly if they had nothing to hide.
1.1.5.2. Pro: If Trump perceives the investigation as a partisan attack, it is not surprising he would be reluctant to cooperate and play into the hands of his political enemies.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.5.3. Con: The special counsel has not accused him of anything yet.
1.1.6. Con: Anyone would be worried about the possible findings of an investigation into their actions, regardless of their innocence.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Investigations can also out unrelated secrets of one's friends and family.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Investigations can require individuals \(and those close to an individual\) to pay large legal fees.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Trump and his family are wealthy.
1.1.7. Con: Trump may also be worried about investigations into his actions prior to the campaign, which have no bearing on whether there was collusion.
1.1.7.1. Con: If he laundered money for Russian mobsters and cut-outs, even before deciding to run for office, that could still have a bearing. Removing sanctions could be a payback for help Russians gave him in the past. Trump's actions to help Russia could also be a way to protect himself from compromising information the Russians have about him.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Mueller has started [looking into](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/trump-russia-investigation/index.html) Trump's pre-election dealings with Russia.
1.1.8. Pro: Trump has previously [banned](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/24/media/cnn-blocked-white-house-gaggle/) certain media outlets who have broken major stories on the Russia investigation, such as the NYT, Politico, and BuzzFeed, from attending White House Press briefings.
1.1.8.1. Con: White House spokesperson Stephanie Grisham [said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/24/media-blocked-white-house-briefing-sean-spicer) that “claims that outlets were excluded are not factual.”
1.1.9. Pro: Trump was furious at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation on the basis of his own involvement. For quite awhile, it seemed that Sessions would resign or be fired as a result.
1.1.9.1. Pro: Mueller is [currently](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/28/17065278/mueller-trump-sessions-russia-investigation) looking into the span of time when it seemed Trump would fire Sessions, ostensibly so he could appoint a new Attorney General that would not recuse themselves. This new appointee would then have been able to hinder Mueller's investigation.
1.1.10. Pro: Trump has [blocked](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/09/politics/democratic-memo-white-house-response/index.html) the release of the Democrats' memo on the Russian Probe.
1.1.10.1. Con: The memo has since been [released](https://www.npr.org/2018/02/26/584585889/fact-check-read-the-democratic-memo-from-the-house-intel-committee).
1.1.11. Pro: Shooting the messenger is a predictable reaction when there is truth to an accusation.
1.1.12. Pro: Trump allegedly ["berated"](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-hope-hicks-lies-resign-white-house-communications-director-russia-a8234156.html) his former Communications Director Hope Hicks after she testified before the House Intelligence Committee on the issue of Russian interference in the election.
1.1.12.1. Con: That was because she confessed to telling [white lies](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-hope-hicks-lies-resign-white-house-communications-director-russia-a8234156.html) on Trump’s behalf, thereby making Trump look bad, not because she agreed to testify before the House Intelligence Committee.
1.1.13. Con: Trump has ignored his lawyers' advice about discussing the investigation with people outside his legal team, and has [spoken](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/01/trump-hope-hicks-russia-433280) about the investigation with aides and other staffers. If he were concerned about the investigation he wouldn't take risks like this.
1.1.13.1. Con: This could also imply that he is getting nervous and speaking out under pressure.
1.1.13.1.1. Pro: Trump's [attempt](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html) to fire Mueller, the [behavior](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/01/09/why-are-trumps-lawyers-nervous-because-mueller-wants-to-interview-trump-about-obstruction/?utm_term=.3728bb4ea2aa) of his lawyers in recent months, and reports of [chaos](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/opinion/trump-chaos.html) inside the White House over the Russia probe and other scandals seem to confirm that he feels cornered by the Special Counsel.
1.1.13.2. Con: Everything we know about Donald Trump tells us that he doesn't tend to exercise more caution when he is concerned about something.  Instead he becomes more reckless and lashes out.
1.1.14. Pro: Trump’s lawyer raised prospect of [pardons](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/us/politics/trump-pardon-michael-flynn-paul-manafort-john-dowd.html) for Flynn and Manafort, indicating that he fears they will tell the special council something incriminating.
1.1.14.1. Con: Flynn and Manafort were both former members of the Trump team. Trump may have been just trying to help his allies.
1.1.15. Con: Trump has [said](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/22/politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller-testimony/index.html) he "would like to" testify under oath before special counsel Mueller." This implies belief in his own innocence.
1.1.15.1. Con: The very fact that it might lead some people to infer his innocence may be the very reason he would either be willing to do it or just say he’s willing to do it.
1.1.16. Pro: Trump is considering [firing](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-considering-firing-rod-rosenstein-2018-4) deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein.
1.1.16.1. Pro: Replacing Rosenstein could render the Russia investigation powerless, as the replacement could [refuse](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/21/16795506/rosenstein-trump-mueller-russia-comey-sessions) to approve any of Mueller's requests or simply fire the special counsel outright.
1.1.16.2. Pro: Trump has [accused](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-wont-fire-mueller-as-campaign-to-discredit-russia-probe-heats-up/2017/12/17/801e8cce-e348-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.09ff6453bfb3) lifelong Republican Rosenstein of being a "Democrat" in the past, implying that he believes the deputy attorney general is biased unfairly against him.
1.1.17. Con: The suggestion that Trump is worried about the investigation is pure speculation and does not prove collusion with Russia in the 2016 election.  Since we don't have all the information on why Trump acted as he did, we really don't know why he did what he did.  That he's worried is just one speculative interpretation of his behavior.
1.2. Pro: The Trump campaign and administration has pursued an oddly pro-Russian agenda, and appointed a number of officials with close relationships to Putin or Russia.
1.2.1. Pro: Wilbur Ross, Trump's Secretary of Commerce, was previously the vice-chairman of the Bank of Cyprus. He presided over a deal in which the bank's Russian businesses were [sold](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/23/wilbur-ross-russian-deal-bank-of-cyprus-donald-trump-commerce-secretary) to Artem Avetisyan, a banker with close ties to Vladimir Putin.
1.2.2. Pro: At a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump [tried](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/02/14/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-says-trump-encouraged-boost-ties-dialogue-putin/#.WnvZYpPwY1j) to persuade him to increase ties with Russia.
1.2.2.1. Con: This meeting was directly related to a longtime territorial dispute between the two nations. Trump was acting as a mediator, not on behalf of the Kremlin.
1.2.3. Pro: Trump himself has made a strangely large number of pro-Putin comments.
1.2.3.1. Pro: When questioned about Putin's killing of journalists, Trump has defended him on [multiple](http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-joe-scarborough-2015-12) [occasions](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-defends-putins-record-on-killing-journalists/) as a candidate and [again](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/317945-trump-defends-putin-you-think-our-country-is-so-innocent) as President.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Trump has called Putin a ["strong leader"](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/trump-praises-putin-216929) who has ["very strong control over his country."](http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-strong-leader-obama-2016-9)
1.2.3.3. Pro: Trump has often heaped praise on Putin by [comparing](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/456895966327480320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [him](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/447191138962014208?lang=en)[positively](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/375971865996832768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [to](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/839101660886614016) former US President Barack Obama.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: All of these comments can be interpreted as Trump highlighting his predecessor's supposed incompetence by comparing Obama's ability to fulfill his country's strategic aims with Putin's.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Con: Even so, the fact that Trump consistently selected Putin as the leader to compare with Obama still implies high regard for the Russian president.
1.2.3.4. Pro: [Trump told reporters](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/16/trump-has-repeatedly-denied-russian-interference-in-the-us-election--but-not-today.html) on a flight to Hanoi in November 2017 that he believed Putin's denial of interference in the elections. This is contradictory to the information coming from the intelligence community. Either Trump isn't reading his briefings or he is ignoring them in Putin's favour.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: Trump does not [believe](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-us-intelligence-briefing-227109) the reports from his intelligence agencies. He most likely thinks they are false.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Trump's consistent praise for Putin is an [anomaly](https://www.cfr.org/article/containing-russia-again-adversary-attacked-united-states-its-time-respond), considering his default position on other nations is to be highly critical.
1.2.3.5.1. Con: Just because ALL of the western nations have the same propagandized views does not mean there should be no room for improvement of relations and even seeking the truth.  Just because it goes against the "demonization of Russia" agenda doesn't mean it's incorrect.
1.2.3.5.2. Con: Trump's views on Putin only seem anomalous when comparing them to his views on traditional US allies in Europe. Indeed, Trump consistently praises a range of authoritarian leaders and right-wing populists, such as China's [Xi Jinping](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/04/donald-trump-praises-xi-jinping-power-grab-give-that-a-shot-china), Turkey's [Erdogan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-turkey/trump-praises-turkeys-erdogan-as-a-friend-idUSKCN1BW2SJ), and the Philippines' [Duterte](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/us/politics/trump-duterte-phone-transcript-philippine-drug-crackdown.html).
1.2.3.5.3. Pro: Trump has made a number of openly antagonistic comments towards close US ally Germany on issues ranging from [trade](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/donald-trump-bei-der-eu-die-deutschen-sind-boese-sehr-boese-a-1149282.html) to [refugee policy](http://www.dw.com/en/donald-trump-slams-angela-merkels-refugee-policy/a-37141791).
1.2.3.5.4. Pro: Trump has taken such positions long before his election. In 1987, he [spent](http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Trump-U-S-Should-Stop-Paying-To-Defend-Countries-that-Can-Protect-Selves/id-05133dbe63ace98766527ec7d16ede08) nearly 100,000 USD to run ads critical of Japan and Saudi Arabia in three major American newspapers.
1.2.3.6. Pro: In 2013, Trump tweeted asking whether he and Putin will become "[best friends.](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/347191326112112640?lang=en)"
1.2.3.7. Con: -> See 1.2.3.5.1.
1.2.3.8. Con: Trump now [claims](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/21/politics/obama-trump-russia-sanctions-fact-check/index.html) his administration is "tougher" on Russia than that of his predecessors.
1.2.3.8.1. Con: Given the pressure of the investigation, this seems an obvious method to distract from his past statements and pro-Russia policies.
1.2.3.8.2. Pro: Trump has [expelled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-expels-60-russian-officers-shuts-seattle-consulate-in-response-to-attack-on-former-spy-in-britain/2018/03/26/8ada3d8e-30f0-11e8-8bdd-cdb33a5eef83_story.html?utm_term=.e40d81d7e91e) 60 Russian diplomats from the United States in retaliation for the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, and closed the Russian consulate in Seattle.
1.2.3.8.2.1. Con: There is a huge [caveat](http://www.businessinsider.com/theres-a-huge-caveat-in-the-us-expulsion-of-60-russian-diplomats-2018-3) in the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats -- they can be replaced by Russia!  Therefore, there is still a question of whether Trump is playing nice with Russia while trying to look forceful to our allies.
1.2.3.8.3. Pro: The Trump administration publicly accused Russia of conducting repeated attempts to [hack](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/u-s-accuses-russia-of-ongoing-operation-to-hack-energy-grid-1.5910428) the US energy grid.
1.2.3.8.4. Pro: The White House has penalized Russia with [sanctions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-russia-sanctions.html) over election meddling and cyber attacks.
1.2.3.8.4.1. Con: These sanctions only occurred [after](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-russia-sanctions-are-trumps-strongest-action-against-moscow--but-far-short-of-what-congress-wanted/2018/03/15/2a2f8352-2869-11e8-bc72-077aa4dab9ef_story.html?utm_term=.079ab1be69bd) Mueller began to indict Russian nationals and subpoenaed the Trump Organization, and are an effort to direct attention away from his increasingly serious investigation.
1.2.3.8.4.2. Con: These sanctions are extremely [limited](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-russia-sanctions-are-trumps-strongest-action-against-moscow--but-far-short-of-what-congress-wanted/2018/03/15/2a2f8352-2869-11e8-bc72-077aa4dab9ef_story.html?utm_term=.079ab1be69bd) in scope and will have a negligible impact on Russia.
1.2.3.9. Pro: Trump wrote Putin a personal [letter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-a-personal-letter-trump-invited-putin-to-the-2013-miss-universe-pageant/2018/03/09/a3404358-23d2-11e8-a589-763893265565_story.html?utm_term=.9c83146c1b27) inviting him to attend the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant.
1.2.4. Pro: The Trump administration [did not renew](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/trump-administration-holds-off-on-new-russia-sanctions-despite-law-idUSKBN1FI2V7) sanctions on Russia despite overwhelming Congressional majorities in favor of them.
1.2.4.1. Con: State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert claims Trump has not enacted new sanctions because they are not [necessary](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions/trump-administration-holds-off-on-new-russia-sanctions-despite-law-idUSKBN1FI2V7): “From that perspective, if the law is working, sanctions on specific entities or individuals will not need to be imposed because the legislation is, in fact, serving as a deterrent."
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Congress makes the laws and they [disagree](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-joins-house-overwhelmingly-passing-new-russian-sanctions-n787291).
1.2.5. Pro: During the campaign Trump implied that the NATO alliance was not rock solid.  He described it as [obsolete](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nato-past-comments/).
1.2.5.1. Con: Since taking office, Trump has reversed his position on the issue of NATO, [claiming](https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-reverses-on-nato-its-no-longer-obsolete/) it is "no longer obsolete."
1.2.5.2. Con: Senior Trump administration officials, such as Vice President [Pence](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/world/europe/pence-munich-speech-nato-merkel.html) and US defense secretary [Mattis](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38979190), have repeatedly pledged continued US commitment to NATO.
1.2.5.3. Pro: The fact that the cons have brought up that Trump changed his mind on the NATO alliance shows that that under Trump the NATO alliance is at his whim and dependent on his mood and therefore not rock solid.
1.2.6. Con: The Trump administration has also [authorized](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/12/20/trump-administration-approves-lethal-arms-sales-to-ukraine/?utm_term=.ff4bfcd75c08) weapons sales to Ukraine and [continues](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russias-nato-neighbors-were-ok-with-trump-actually-1) to support the Baltic states militarily, both moves which are antithetical to Russian interests.
1.2.6.1. Con: Trump's actions are antithetical to Russian interests only if we assume that Russia is pursuing regional stability. However, if the region is in turmoil, Russia can 'step in' and be seen as the peacemaker, which is not possible during regional peace. Russia is better served by regional chaos than stability.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: Arming regional governments exacerbates tensions because seeing a neighbouring country spending money on armed forces and defence suggests they are concerned with the possibility of war, or may even be preparing for an invasion/ offensive action. In this way distrust between countries in a region can grow and be perpetuated.
1.2.6.1.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that the Baltic countries \(Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia\) will be pushed towards tension by the arming of their neighbors given they have very close relations through being in both [NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/su/natohq/nato_countries.htm) and the [EU](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries_en).
1.2.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: These countries, due to their historic role in the Soviet sphere, are united in their [distrust](http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-propaganda-in-lithuania-attack-on-the-baltics-2017-4) toward Russia.
1.2.6.1.1.2. Con: It is unlikely that the Ukraine will be afraid of an increasingly armed Baltics \(and vice versa\). This is because Ukraine does not share a border with any Baltic state.
1.2.6.1.2. Con: Russia's ability to "step in" is undermined by arming the regimes they seek to control.
1.2.6.1.2.1. Pro: It is harder to take over countries that have more weapons.
1.2.6.1.2.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that the the weapons will make any difference in the Baltics which are already strongly backed by [NATO](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2016/Also-in-2016/security-baltic-defense-nato/EN/index.htm).
1.2.6.1.2.1.2. Con: The weapons given to the Ukraine and the Baltics will make very little difference against the far more powerful Russian military.
1.2.6.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Germany has [opposed](https://www.stripes.com/news/europe/merkel-takes-fire-for-stance-on-no-weapons-to-ukraine-1.328377) arming Ukraine precisely because they feel it will make little difference against a far more powerful Russian military.
1.2.6.1.2.2. Con: Russia's strategy to control the Baltics and Ukraine is not only through military action. Russia's [intelligence operations and media influence](http://www.newsweek.com/counting-down-russian-invasion-baltics-414877) are not impacted by arming these states.
1.2.6.1.3. Pro: The [Baltic states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians_in_the_Baltic_states) and [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians_in_Ukraine) have large Russian minority populations. An increasingly armed state could be seen as a threat to these minorities. This could be a justification for Russian intervention.
1.2.6.1.3.1. Pro: Russia has used threats to ethnic Russian minorities as [justification](https://thinkprogress.org/what-we-can-learn-about-ukraine-from-russias-last-invasion-c39905a4f219/) for invasion in Georgia and Ukraine.
1.2.6.1.3.2. Pro: The Russian foreign ministry has already [asserted](https://www.vox.com/2014/10/1/6880329/russia-baltic-threats-ukraine-estonia) that the Kremlin is responsible for the defense of the rights and interests of ethnic Russians in the Baltic states.
1.2.6.2. Pro: The State Department recently [approved](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-03-01/us-plans-to-sell-210-anti-tank-missiles-to-ukraine) the sale of 201 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, with the explicit aim of helping defend its territorial integrity from Russia.
1.2.6.3. Con: It's plausible that such authorizations occur because Trump has granted the Pentagon broad discretionary [authority](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/14/donald-trumps-hands-off-approach-gives-us-military-free-rein) in all kinds of military matters, and that Trump's actual position on the matter mirrors the pro-Russian position he took during the campaign.
1.2.6.4. Con: Even if one discounts Trump's long [history](http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/03/politics/trump-putin-russia-timeline/) of pro-Putin comments and accepts the idea that Trump's foreign policy platform didn't perfectly align with Russia's goals, Putin was still incentivized to back Trump. The divisiveness of Trump's candidacy meant that his campaign would cause domestic turmoil in the US, something which benefits Russia.
1.2.7. Pro: Trump could have hired just about any GOP strategist to run his campaign. Yet he chose Paul Manafort, who is well known for his links to Russian oligarchs.
1.2.7.1. Con: Trump has significant problems attracting qualified advisors, primarily because he was seen as unlikely to win, but also because of his platform, comments, and actions.
1.2.7.1.1. Con: Manafort [became](http://fortune.com/2017/03/22/paul-manafort-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/) campaign manager after Corey Lewandowski was fired, in mid-May 2016. By this time the Republican Party had essentially acknowledged Trump had won the nomination. Therefore, Trump could have had access to a much wider base of GOP talent if he so chose.
1.2.8. Pro: US Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers told lawmakers that he has [not been granted the authority](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/cybercom-rogers-trump-russian-cyber-threat/index.html) by President Donald Trump to disrupt Russian election hacking operations where they originate.
1.2.8.1. Con: Trump could be doing this for many other reasons. The majority of Russian hacking methods are social media campaigns for Trump and his allies. This is not illegal and Trump does not have to be coordinating with the Russians in an unsavory way to want them to do this.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: Russia has been implicated in hacked servers and possibly [polling stations](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/09/22/wisconsin-one-20-states-targeted-russian-hacking-elections-systems-2016/694719001/). The head of cyber command should have the authority to make that determination
1.2.9. Pro: Trump's former Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has a close relationship with Russian officials. He once personally received the [Order of Friendship](http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/11/investing/rex-tillerson-exxon-russia-putin/index.html), Russia's highest award for foreigners, from Vladimir Putin.
1.2.10. Pro: Trump has [displayed](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/06/politics/russian-meddling-donald-trump/index.html) a marked lack of concern at the idea that Russia will interfere in the 2018 midterm elections.
1.2.10.1. Con: If you were Trump, and didn't believe Russia had hacked the 2016 election, you would have very little reason to believe they would hack the 2018 election.
1.2.10.1.1. Con: The White House has [publicly](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-russia-sanctions.html) recognized that Russia interfered in the elections.
1.2.11. Pro: Trump has [not made](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/03/us-russia-nato-uk/555407/) any statements whatsoever about Russia's attempted assassination of Russian defector Sergei Skripal, which occurred on UK soil.
1.2.11.1. Con: Donald Trump has since stated the US will [condemn](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/mar/13/tillerson-firmly-backs-uk-over-salisbury-spy-poisoning-as-white-house-refuses-to-blame-russia-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-5aa7e40be4b0ccc2e5bc5c2c) Russia if indeed they were behind the attack.
1.2.11.1.1. Con: The problem is that he will delay accusing Russia for as long as possible and, even with the evidence mounting, still has not personally declared Russia the culprit.
1.2.11.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.8.2.
1.2.12. Pro: Rex Tillerson was [fired](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rex-tillerson-gets-fired-the-day-after-he-criticized-russia) by Trump a day after criticizing Russia.
1.2.12.1. Pro: Interestingly, it was also just after Exxon/Mobil decided that the Russian oil contract \(worth ~$500B\) was never going to be settled due to sanctions and had pulled out of the deal, so Tillerson's value had sunk in Trump's and Putin's eyes.
1.2.13. Pro: Trump, his brand, as well as his family members that run his organizations have done business in Russia \(Trump Tower Moscow, Miss Universe pageant\) and with its oligarchs. Their properties in Panama, Azerbaijan, and Atlantic City were all linked to shady financiers. Moreover, Trump's financial instability and multiple bankruptcies make him vulnerable to blackmail. Trump idolizes Putin, and wondered publicly "if he would be \[my\] new best friend" Trump not only colluded, but was groomed for this.
1.2.14. Con: -> See 1.2.3.8.2.
1.2.15. Con: -> See 1.2.3.8.3.
1.2.16. Con: -> See 1.2.3.8.4.
1.2.17. Pro: Trump [claimed](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/trump-u-s-leaving-syria-very-soon-let-others-take-care-of-it-1.5961986) that the US will be withdrawing troops from Syria "very soon." This would benefit Russia.
1.2.17.1. Pro: US withdrawal from Syria would leave Russia \(and its ally Iran\) as the [only](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/30/politics/trump-russia-syria/index.html) major power broker in the country.
1.2.17.2. Pro: Trump has since [frozen](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/world/middleeast/syria-us-coalition-deaths.html) more than 200 million USD in funds planned to assist recovery efforts in Syria.
1.2.17.3. Con: The White house has subsequently said that the US will [remain](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/world/middleeast/trump-syria-troops.html) in Syria.
1.2.18. Pro: Trump's former national security advisor Lt. Gen. HR McMaster has [said](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/03/politics/mcmaster-russia-costs/index.html) that "we have failed to impose sufficient costs" on Russia.
1.2.19. Con: The Trump administration has [sanctioned](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/381930-trump-administration-to-sanction-russian-oligarchs) seven prominent Russian oligarchs and twelve associated companies in retaliation for a number of Moscow's actions against the US interest, including election meddling.
1.2.20. Con: Trump and his administration have taken a hostile stance against Syria's Assad regime, a close Russian ally.
1.2.20.1. Pro: Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has [blamed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/new-chemical-attacks-reported-in-syria-and-trump-administration-blames-russia/2018/01/23/52167730-005b-11e8-86b9-8908743c79dd_story.html) Russia for the ongoing massacre of Syrian rebels in Eastern Ghouta.
1.2.20.1.1. Con: That is the reason he is the "former" Secretary of State.
1.2.20.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.12.
1.2.20.1.1.2. Con: Tillerson had longstanding disagreements with Trump on policy issues ranging from [Iran](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/01/12/iran-deal-trump-sanctions/1028656001/) to [North Korea](http://www.businessinsider.com/rex-tillerson-fired-north-korea-2018-3). Both of these could have been ample justification for his firing.
1.2.20.2. Pro: Trump's use of missile strikes against the Assad Regime greatly [angered](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/trump-syria-missiles-assad-chemical-weapons) Russia. This seems antithetical to pursuing closer ties with Russia.
1.2.20.2.1. Con: While this act made a good spectacle, it did not fundamentally alter the situation on the ground. Trump has since allowed the Assad regime to regain control over much of Syria. Additionally, his administration [ended](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-40667229) a covert CIA program which provided weapons and other supplies to Syrian rebels.
1.2.20.2.1.1. Con: This was likely done to appease Turkey, as many militant groups in Syria used such weapons [against](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/24/566377916/turkey-says-trump-promises-to-stop-arming-kurds-in-syria) Turkey.
1.2.20.2.2. Pro: Since taking office, Donald Trump has been tough on Assad in Syria and Kim in North Korea. Both of those dictators are Russian allies. Since President Trump has been so tough on Moscow and her allies, I doubt that the Russians had some Secret Squirrel conspiracy going to help him win.
1.2.20.2.2.1. Con: Russia is [selling oil](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/12/30/north-korea-received-oil-from-russia-in-violation-un-sanctions-report.html) to North Korea in violation of sanctions and Trump has said nothing about it.
1.2.20.2.3. Con: The Trump Administration gave Russia [notice](https://theintercept.com/2017/04/07/trump-surrenders-element-surprise-warning-russia-planned-strike-ally-syria/) before the bombing.
1.2.20.2.4. Con: The problem here is that Trump demonstrated "Shoot First and get the facts later" attitude in this case.  Also - he got away with it. In fact CNN was cheering Trump on when he started the attack.  All of this probably based on the wrong information about the Sarin gas attacks in Syria! Why would Assad have done this attack? - it's not plausible.
1.2.20.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.2.20.3. Pro: The Trump administration is currently [consulting](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-syria-chemical-attack-us-response-20180409-story.html) with close allies such as France and Britain about a military response to Assad's most recent alleged use of chemical weapons.
1.2.20.4. Pro: Trump has directly [threatened](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/syria-chemical-attack-trump-threatens-bashar-animal-assad-putin-chemical-weapons-strike-2018-04-08/) Assad on Twitter, referring him to an "animal" and holding him responsible for the ongoing chemical weapons attacks in Syria.
1.2.21. Con: Stating that Trump is friendly with Russia does not prove that he colluded with Russia to affect the 2016 election.
1.2.21.1. Con: No, but a pattern of coincidences is a reasonable cause to be skeptical.
1.2.21.2. Pro: If friendliness with an entity were "proof" of collusion, then any politician may be said to have also have engaged in collusion. 
\([Post hoc ergo propter hoc](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/false-cause)\)
1.2.21.2.1. Con: Close ties with agents of a foreign power \(particularly one that has taken hostile actions against the US\) is not common among politicians in high office for issues of [security clearances](https://news.clearancejobs.com/2017/07/11/3-scenarios-foreign-influence-can-cost-clearance/).
1.2.21.2.1.1. Pro: This is why Kushner had to [lie](http://www.newsweek.com/jared-kushner-security-clearance-form-684590) on his security forms.
1.2.21.3. Con: An overwhelming pattern of coincidences seems a reasonable way to prove someone did something.
1.2.21.3.1. Con: Correlation does not equal causation. Coincidences can not be used as an equivalent for logical and coherent proof.
1.2.22. Pro: Trump used a law firm that was named [Russia's Law Firm of the Year](https://nypost.com/2017/05/12/trump-used-russia-law-firm-of-the-year-to-draft-letter-about-his-finances/) to draft a letter about his finances.
1.2.23. Pro: Trump's campaign pushed for pro-Russian changes to the official GOP platform, specifically regarding [Ukraine](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/jd-gordon-change-story-gop-platform-ukraine-amendment).
1.2.24. Pro: The Trump administration has repeatedly presented misinformation and obscured details about Trump's meetings with Russian officials.
1.2.24.1. Pro: In spite of photos published by Russian media, Trump attempted to [hide](https://thinkprogress.org/trump-kislyak-meeting-f91eaa90c03c/) that Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak was also present at a meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov.
1.2.24.2. Pro: Trump [barred](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/us/politics/trump-russia-meeting-american-reporters-blocked.html?_r=0) the U.S. media from witnessing a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, but allowed Russia's state-run media to cover the meeting.
1.2.25. Con: All of these moves could be seen as an attempt to improve political relations with Russia, with the goal of cooperation on counter-terrorism measures.
1.2.25.1. Con: An improvement in relations with Russia would involve a give-and-take. But Trump has only given. He's made repeated concessions to Putin without securing any benefits for America in return.
1.2.25.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.2.25.1.2. Pro: Trump [disclosed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/world/middleeast/israel-trump-classified-intelligence-russia.html?smid=tw-share) highly sensitive intel from Israel about the Islamic State terror group to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, without Israel's [permission](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.5c48805ec799).
1.2.25.1.2.1. Con: Putin [denies](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-putin/putin-offers-transcript-to-prove-trump-did-not-pass-russia-secrets-idUSKCN18D1EA) that Trump disclosed any intel, and has offered to provide Congress with a transcript of the meeting to substantiate his assertion.
1.2.25.1.3. Con: Russia has been doing the heavy lifting as far as fighting ISIS in Syria. This saves a lot of money and lives for the USA. Cooperation here can be beneficial.
1.2.25.1.3.1. Con: On the contrary, there are [reports](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/02/21/russia-stumbles-in-the-fog-of-syrian-war/) that Russia is making the situation in Syria worse which could cost American money and lives.
1.2.25.1.4. Con: Russia pretty much has a big influence on Iran. Iran is misunderstood by the USA. The USA can benefit from this.
1.2.25.2. Pro: Closer relations between the United States and Russia is a good thing. Great Britain was once our enemy.  Now they're our best friend \(if you discount the Chris Steele affair\).
1.2.25.2.1. Con: Russia and the US have wildly divergent and frequently opposing foreign policy goals.
1.2.25.2.2. Con: The Russian government commits widespread human rights abuses. The US should not ally themselves with such governments.
1.2.25.2.2.1. Con: The United States has historically backed [a](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27961933) [number](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/saudi-arabia) of governments which commit human rights abuses in the name of strategic interest. If it is in the interest of the US to foster an improved relationship with Russia, its leaders should take that chance.
1.2.25.2.2.2. Pro: The UN has [accused](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41386490) Russia of human rights abuses in Crimea.
1.2.25.2.2.3. Pro: Russia is one of the principal backers of Syria's Assad regime, which has committed widespread human rights abuses including the [torture and mass murder](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-warcrimes/experts-say-war-crimes-case-against-assad-government-growing-idUSKBN16M24Z) of detainees and the [use](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/human-rights-watch-report-in-syria-pattern-of-chemical-weapons-attacks-by-assad-regime/) of chemical weapons against military and civilian targets.
1.2.25.2.2.3.1. Pro: Both nations, working together, [committed](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/12/01/russia/syria-war-crimes-month-bombing-aleppo) war crimes during the bombing of Aleppo.
1.2.25.2.2.4. Pro: Russian planes have been [linked](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/world/middleeast/syria-russia-un-war-crimes.html) to war crimes in Syria by UN investigators.
1.2.25.2.2.5. Pro: Russia has [adopted](https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/18/online-and-all-fronts/russias-assault-freedom-expression) numerous laws which heavily inhibit free speech and expression.
1.2.25.2.2.5.1. Pro: Besides the Russian Orthodox Church, many religious groups' activities are heavily [restricted](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-yarovaya-law-religious-freedom-restrictions/27852531.html).
1.2.25.2.2.6. Con: The US has also [committed](https://www.aclu.org/blog/human-rights/human-rights-and-criminal-justice/un-issues-scathing-assessment-us-human-rights) widespread human rights abuses.
1.2.25.3. Pro: Instead of demonizing Russia, Trump did say that he would rather have a cooperative relationship. He recognizes that the Cold War was supposed to end in 1991, and NATO has been wasting money preparing for some imaginary foe.
1.2.25.3.1. Con: Russia's [invasion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2016/11/20/international-criminal-court-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-is-a-crime-not-a-civil-war/) of Ukraine, its military [support](https://www.npr.org/2017/04/08/523103217/why-vladimir-putin-continues-to-back-the-assad-regime) for Syrian dictator Assad, and its alleged [attempts](http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-u-s-diplomats-backing-balkan-republics-1488299997-htmlstory.html) at undermining western democracies' political processes prove that NATO's actions are entirely justified.
1.2.25.4. Con: Trump had openly expressed admiration for Putin before running for and winning the presidency. The idea that Trump in 2013 was angling for a simple counter-terrorism alliance with Putin two years before he'd even announced his candidacy is dubious.
1.2.25.4.1. Con: It is equally ludicrous to suggest Trump had been colluding with Putin two years before he announced his candidacy.
1.2.26. Pro: The FBI arrested 12 Russian Hackers for meddling with the election in support of Trump. Putin himself publicly said he wanted Trump to win. After all the evidence presented to Trump, Trump himself said “I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial,” Trump said.
1.2.27. Pro: -> See 1.2.25.1.2.
1.3. Con: It is difficult to prove that an activity like collusion did not or could not have happened, so the burden of proof is on the accuser. It is clear, however, that the body of evidence that currently exists cannot prove collusion.
1.3.1. Con: At least 2 eyewitnesses, Cohen and Patten, are purported to say that Trump knew about beforehand and approved the Trump Tower meeting to get dirt on Hillary. Trump's own boasting on Twitter before the meeting further supports that he was expecting to get dirt on Hillary at that time.
1.3.2. Pro: There is no evidence of systematic efforts by the Trump campaign to contact and work with the Russians, only a few individuals.
1.3.2.1. Con: The individuals in question are at the top levels of the campaign and/or members of the president's immediate family.
1.3.2.2. Pro: While Mueller's indictment [mentions](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/16/17020776/russian-indictments-robert-mueller) "unwitting" individuals in the Trump campaign that had communications with Russians, it does not allege collusion.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: Given the politically fraught atmosphere of the investigation, wording the indictment this way simply means Mueller is being cautious. It does not preclude him having evidence that the Trump team's Russian connections were purposeful.
1.3.3. Pro: There is little evidence that couldn't also be coincidence.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Jared Kushner's meeting with the Russian lawyer, for instance, was supposed to be on another topic prior to the lawyer talking about making a deal with the Trump campaign.
1.3.3.2. Pro: The Russians were always likely to reach out and try to collude with the Trump campaign, but this doesn't mean that the Trump campaign wanted to or reciprocated.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: When offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton "as part of the Russian Government's support of Mr. Trump," Donald Trump Jr. said "[I love it.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/trump-russia-email-clinton.html)"
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: Not only was he offered help, but he accepted, and he and several other campaign officials knowingly met in Trump tower with known Russian agents to discuss what they knew was illegally obtained intel. This is, by definition, collusion with foreign agents.
1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: This indicates that the Trump campaign was willing to accept help from the Russian government, in violation of the [law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/11/110.20) against foreign nationals contributing "anything of value" to a campaign.
1.3.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Opposition research is often paid for by campaigns, which means that it is something they consider "of value."
1.3.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Conspiracy to commit a crime doesn't require the crime to actually happen. It's still conspiracy.
1.3.3.2.1.2.3. Con: It is almost certainly true that Don Jr did not know this was the law at the time. Had he known this was the law, and this offer was unusual, he might have acted differently.
1.3.3.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: To Don Jr, this offer probably seemed like a normal part of opposition research, a major part of every political campaign.
1.3.3.2.1.2.3.2. Con: Lack of knowledge of what exactly constitutes breaking a law does not preclude someone from being guilty of breaking it. Trump Jr. could be guilty of breaking this law without knowing that what he did was illegal.
1.3.3.2.1.3. Pro: This shows a clear willingness on the part of the Trump Campaign to collude with the Russian government.  And so it lends plausibility to the notion of collusion.
1.3.3.2.2. Con: Trump [publicly invited](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-democratic-convention-2016-live-donald-trump-invites-russia-to-hack-1469636224-htmlstory.html) Russia to hack into his opponent’s email in July of 2016.
1.3.3.2.2.1. Con: Even if the invitation were taken seriously, to assume that Russians could assemble, create and launch a hack in 4 months, let alone be effective in hacking, distribution and impact is absurd.
1.3.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Russian hackers sat down and started directly attacking email systems relating to the DNC and Clinton campaign 4 hours after the statement by Trump
1.3.3.2.2.1.2. Con: If the Russian government was already involved in a hacking effort, the proposal could just be a suggestion to re-prioritize, not begin a new attack.
1.3.3.2.2.1.3. Con: The server with the 33K emails that Trump referenced was already in FBI custody and off line when Trump made his comment, making it impossible for Russia to hack.
1.3.3.2.2.1.3.1. Con: It is very, very unlikely that Trump knew this.
1.3.3.2.2.2. Pro: About one month prior to this, top Trump campaign officials met with Russian cut-outs claiming to have useful information about Trump’s opponent. So, Trump was apparently aware that the hacking effort was already underway.
1.3.3.2.2.2.1. Con: This claim lacks evidence or citation.
1.3.3.2.2.3. Con: Trump has a history of making [excessive](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-36949974/trump-calls-clinton-the-devil), often [absurd](https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/trump-ted-cruz-father-222730) threats and claims about political rivals, Clinton [particularly](https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/09/politics/eric-holder-nixon-trump-presidential-debate/index.html). There was no secret scheme exposed here, only incredulity at the idea that Clinton's emails were "missing" and a wild plea that they be "found."
1.3.3.2.2.3.1. Con: One of Donald Trump's rhetorical tactics is saying something that is generally offensive to people and then claiming it was a joke when it was, in fact, sincere.[arktimes.com](https://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2018/02/06/trump-just-joking-about-treason-spokesman-says)
1.3.3.2.2.3.2. Con: Crouching genuine intent in the language of absurdity is a good way to ensure the people you want to hear your message hear it, and the remainder of the public tunes it out.
1.3.3.2.2.4. Con: That "request" was made by Trump as a joke. It was an obvious joke!
1.3.3.2.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.2.3.1.
1.3.3.2.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.2.3.2.
1.3.3.2.2.5. Con: This assertion misquotes Donald Trump and is misleading. The [exact phrase](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-36909520/donald-trump-urges-russia-to-find-hillary-s-emails) Trump used was "'find Hillary's emails.' It was the Clinton Campaign that then conflated the word "find" with "hack" by stating that Donald Trump has "actively encouraged" foreign powers to hack his presidential rival.
1.3.3.2.2.5.1. Pro: Depending on the manner in which Russia \(or its agents\) could hypothetically "find" or recover lost or stolen emails would not necessarily constitute a crime.
1.3.3.2.2.5.2. Con: Accepting assistance from a foreign government to aid in Trump's campaign via the acquisition of information would violate campaign rules and remains illegal regardless of the means with which said information was acquired. Requesting assistance from Russia suggests he was willing to break the law. [www.fec.gov](https://www.fec.gov/updates/foreign-nationals/)
1.3.3.2.2.6. Pro: Russians tried to hack Clinton server on the day Trump urged email search [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/13/russians-hillary-clinton-email-server-trump-indictment)
1.3.3.3. Pro: Coincidence is not sufficient because it doesn't demonstrate the sort of intent critical to an action like collusion.
1.3.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.21.3.
1.3.3.5. Pro: A number of notable figures in both political parties [agree](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2017/05/23/there-remains-no-evidence-of-trump-russia-collusion/#5cd842bf242c) that the extant evidence is insufficient to prove collusion, including Maxine Waters, Senator Diane Feinstein, and Senator Lindsay Graham.
1.3.3.5.1. Con: The [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2017/05/23/there-remains-no-evidence-of-trump-russia-collusion/#450751a3242c) is from May, 2017, and thus predates a significant amount of reporting.
1.3.3.5.1.1. Con: None of these figures appear to have issued statements saying they believe there is now sufficient evidence or have changed their opinion.
1.3.3.5.1.1.1. Con: Given the media attention the original statements received, politicians may be reluctant to comment \(whether to stand by or reject their earlier statements\) on a rapidly developing situation with huge scope for political blowback.
1.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.21.3.
1.3.5. Pro: We are seeing evidence of Russian interference, but so far have not seen evidence of collusion with the Trump campaign.  This is still true after extensive investigation with independent counsel.  If special counsel has grounds to indict members of the Trump campaign, it should do so.  Until then, there is no collusion.
1.3.6. Con: The ongoing FBI probe has found much more information than the small portion that the media has knowledge of, and brought to light.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Given that Assange received leaked information in the form of the DNC/ Podesta emails, he could provide the kind of evidence or 'proof' the public desires about whether collusion took place.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: The unfortunate problem here is that Julian Assange refuses to reveal his source for this.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: WikiLeaks has close [ties](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/1/6/14179240/wikileaks-russia-ties) to the Russian government.
1.3.6.1.2.1. Pro: WikiLeaks [chose](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/17/wikileaks-turned-down-leaks-on-russian-government-during-u-s-presidential-campaign/) not to leak information about Russia's involvement in Ukraine while the US election was going on, instead honing in on the Clinton campaign.
1.3.6.1.2.2. Pro: Hillary Clinton has [accused](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/16/hillary-clinton-julian-assange-russia-243811) Assange of being a Russian puppet.
1.3.6.1.2.3. Pro: Russia's government-funded media outlet RT has routinely [provided](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-did-wikileaks-become-associated-with-russia/) Assange with a platform since 2012, and once gave him his own talk show.
1.3.6.1.2.4. Pro: Russia has given [asylum](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/world/europe/edward-snowden-asylum-russia.html) to Wikileaks leaker Edward Snowden.
1.3.6.2. Con: We need to wait until the hidden information is known before we can make a logical and sound conclusion using said information.
1.3.7. Pro: The House Intelligence Committee found [no evidence](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/12/politics/house-republicans-russia-conclusions/index.html) that Russia attempted to help Trump win the election, or that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.
1.3.7.1. Con: This Committee was led by the GOP and suffered from partisan bias.
1.3.7.1.1. Pro: The investigation was [unwilling](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=361) to subpoena bank, phone, and other records to corroborate key witness testimony.
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: The Committee declined to interview prominent Trump associates, such as ex-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.
1.3.7.2. Con: It is generally agreed upon that the Russians intervened in the election to hurt Hillary Clinton.
1.3.7.2.1. Pro: Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election, yet he continues to publicly doubt this conclusion, which makes it seem like he has something to hide.
1.3.7.2.1.1. Con: Highly classified documents are not available to the public, there's no way to know the specifics of what was said.
1.3.7.2.2. Con: What is generally accepted is that Russians interjected false news on both political spectrums to sow discord. Stating falsely that they solely attacked Clinton plays right into their hands.
1.3.7.2.2.1. Pro: An internal [investigation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/09/06/facebook-finds-russian-ads-sought-sow-division-during-u-s-election/639587001/) by Facebook supports the idea that Russian ads on their platform were aimed at voters of all kinds of political affiliations. For example, Russians [impersonated](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/30/blacktivist-facebook-account-russia-us-election) a group of activists aiming to combat police brutality.
1.3.7.2.2.1.1. Con: Internal investigations are not generally acceptable sources of information. A company will publish reports that are favorable to their brand. To do otherwise would abrogate the company's fiduciary duties to its stockholders.
1.3.7.2.2.1.2. Con: In addition to content about police brutality, the Russian account "Blacktivist" [published](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-indictment-blacktivist-20180216-story.html) content aimed at undermining Clinton's base, urging voters to "choose peace and vote for Jill Stein."
1.3.7.2.2.2. Con: The CIA, NSA and FBI [agree](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/russia-trump-and-2016-us-election) that there was an organised Russian campaign to interfere and influence the election result. They identified two core aims: 1\) Damaging Clinton's campaign 2\) Undermining democracy in the USA.
1.3.7.2.2.2.1. Con: That article says they have "high confidence", not evidence.
1.3.7.2.2.2.1.1. Con: An intelligence organization is "highly confident" about a conclusion exactly because they have evidence of it.
1.3.7.2.2.3. Con: Mueller's indictment of 13 Russian nationals explicitly [claims](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/muellers-indictment-reveals-details-of-russian-election-interference/553625/) that Russia engaged in a concerted effort to elect Trump president.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1. Con: Whether or not Russia wanted Trump to be president and took action on social media to support him does not imply that the Trump campaign actively colluded with them.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: The Trump campaign had lots of incentives not to collude with the Russians.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The penalties for obstruction of justice and other crimes related to collusion are extremely high.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Such consequences would be unlikely to worry Trump if he didn't think he would be caught.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The Trump campaign would have known that collusion would be really easy to discover.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Trump's campaign and administration are [notoriously](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/02/the-leaks-coming-out-of-the-trump-white-house-right-now-are-totally-bananas/) [leaky](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-trump-administration-has-sprung-a-leak-many-of-them-in-fact/2017/02/05/a13fad24-ebe2-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html), meaning that information [always gets out](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/5/19/15662842/trump-leaks-stop) to the public and media.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The FBI and other agencies keep close tabs on what Russian intelligence are doing.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Much of what the FBI initially learned of contacts between Russians and Trump officials happened because of surveillance of those [Russians.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/what-does-it-mean-trump-may-have-been-incidentally-surveilled-n737366)
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Based on the book ["Fire and Fury"](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/michael-wolff-fire-and-fury-book-donald-trump.html), the Trump campaign had no intention or expectation of winning the election. From that perspective, it is easy to imagine how they were contacted by Russian organizations. They likely accepted any help they could get without understanding the implications, and expecting that they would never fall under scrutiny because they were never going to win.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.3. Con: The Trump campaign would have been unlikely to consider the penalty for obstruction of justice at the time they made a decision to start colluding, as obstruction of justice involves lying to authorities, and it is very unlikely that they could have predicted an investigation like the one that is currently underway.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: This would be the most serious scandal since [Watergate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/watergate/) and would most likely force his resignation as the Republican nominee.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.5. Pro: [Due](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-punishment-for-obstruction-of-justice-for-trump-is-murky-58390) to the widely-held view that the Constitution protects a sitting president from being put on trial, the most likely legal route would be impeachment.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Given the [difficulty](http://time.com/4711273/donald-trump-impeachment-odds-challenges/) of the impeachment process, the Trump campaign probably didn't perceive it as a real penalty they would face \(especially since their party was on track to control the House and Senate\).
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.2.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: A savvy non-politician, Trump had incentives not to sabotage his quest for the White House. Many of his voters consider him to be [honest and patriotic](https://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/trump-nation/#/?_k=wgdx5l) in his work for 'WeThePeople' and the United States.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.3.1. Con: Trump is an atypically controversial president who lies at a rate that [dramatically outpaces](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/14/opinion/sunday/trump-lies-obama-who-is-worse.html) his predecessor. The media is doing its job objectively by calling him out and questioning his facts.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.3.2. Con: We cannot know what Trump would or would not do. We cannot even say for sure that he wanted to win the election. It is possible that his campaign was only intended to be an elaborate publiclity stunt.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.2.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Trump once [pitched](https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/08/politics/donald-trump-steak-wine-water-press-conference/index.html) his branded products, such as steaks and water, at a campaign event during the GOP primary.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.3.3. Con: He does not seem honest. He has frequently made brazen false statements which could be easily disproven.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Trump aides such as Hope Hicks have [admitted](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hicks-testimony-house-committee-trump-1.4554976) before Congress to lying on his behalf.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: Trump claimed that he had no knowledge of the hush payment given to adult film star Stormy Daniels on his behalf, which had been arranged by his personal attorney Michael Cohen. He then later [admitted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/26/donald-trump-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels) that Cohen represented him in legal matters involving Daniels.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.3.4. Con: According to a recent poll, a strong majority of Trump voters \([77 percent](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-voters-support-him-even-he-colluded-with-russia-2017-12)\) believe that he should stay in office even if it were conclusively proven his campaign colluded with Russia.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5. Pro: The discovery that he had colluded with Russia would lose Trump the election and undercut his base of support.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1. Pro: Trump's whole [platform](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/315275-trump-were-giving-power-back-to-the-people) was about how he would restore power back to the heartland of America and the economically disadvantaged parts of the country. Working with Putin would hardly be perceived as bringing power back to the people or making America great again.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.1. Con: Trump's most praiseworthy comments on Putin were often [coupled](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/456895966327480320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) with critiques of Obama-administration policies. It's plausible that some of his base perceived these statements as showcasing Trump's intent to demonstrate 'strength' on the international stage in a manner similar to Putin, rather than an indication of personal ties with the Russian president.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.6.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: The Republican Party has been traditionally more [hawkish](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/16/republicans-used-to-fear-russians-heres-what-they-think-now/?utm_term=.e05bb4e764cd) on Russia than the Democrats.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: Whether the party has or has not "traditionally" been hawkish, current actions and statements by members of the party and most especially members of the Trump campaign and subsequent administration have clearly belied any tradition. For example, while one may "traditionally" have celebrated Christmas by decorating a tree in my home, they may also no longer do so for a variety of reasons.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.2.2. Con: Republicans have shown fealty to the party, and in particular, the head of the party \(Trump\) to be of greater value than traditional positions. This is clearly demonstrated through statements, actions, and polling.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.2.3. Con: Even before Trump's campaign and election, during which Republicans' views on Russia [became](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/10/25/republicans-change-long-held-opinions-accommodate-trump-polls-show/KD1uhgMw7vM51alvkiJBML/story.html) much more favorable, Putin has been targeting segments of the American right.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.2.3.1. Pro: Putin's 2013 state of the nation address was openly [critical](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/) of the "genderless and infertile" beliefs of the American left, and praised "traditional values." This was widely interpreted as him attempting to portray himself as the leader in a worldwide conservative movement.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.2.3.2. Pro: The alt-right [admires Putin](http://www.newsweek.com/leaders-charlottesvilles-alt-right-protest-all-have-ties-russian-fascist-651384) for keeping Russia as a "white state."
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.2.3.3. Pro: Russian politicians have been [building ties](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/590076949/depth-of-russian-politicians-cultivation-of-nra-ties-revealed) with the National Rifle Association, a conservative group which prominently backs Trump and other Republican candidates, for over six years.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.2.3.3.1. Pro: In 2015, Russia [hosted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-republican-right-found-allies-in-russia/2017/04/30/e2d83ff6-29d3-11e7-a616-d7c8a68c1a66_story.html?utm_term=.5077eb36eb00) an NRA delegation in Moscow.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.2.3.3.2. Pro: The FBI is [investigating](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fbi-russia-nra-donald-trump-campaign-election-investigation-mueller-banker-money-a8225581.html) whether Kremlin-linked Russian individuals channeled foreign money into the NRA effort to elect Trump.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.2.3.3.2.1. Pro: Alexander Torshin, a Russian ex-politician and businessman who allegedly funneled money to the NRA, [claims](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/russian-banker-met-trump-nra-article-1.3850535) he met Trump through NRA intermediaries.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.1.2.3.3.2.2. Pro: The NRA has [refused](https://thinkprogress.org/nra-moscow-letter-response-ce606fc127ed/) to answer questions by senators regarding its ties to Russia.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.2. Con: Trump said he could shoot someone and [not lose support](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-says-he-could-shoot-somebody-still-maintain-support-n502911). There is no reason to believe that he would be afraid of losing support by colluding with Russia.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Indeed, mainstream Republican views on Russia [shifted](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/10/25/republicans-change-long-held-opinions-accommodate-trump-polls-show/KD1uhgMw7vM51alvkiJBML/story.html) dramatically during and after the 2016 election, in order to accommodate Trump's pro-Putin stance.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.3.4.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.2.3. Con: Trump was referring to his supporters, not the general public. He still needs many non-supporters to vote for him to win elections. Non-supporters would quite likely be turned of from Trump if they believed he colluded with Russia.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.3. Con: Trump generally praises Putin, so there is no reason to believe he would view interacting with Putin as a negative.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.1.4.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.5. Pro: A presidential candidate colluding with Russia would be perceived as unethical.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.5.1. Con: Trump, along with many of his campaign members \(particularly the several that have either pleaded guilty or are facing trial under a criminal indictment\) has not demonstrated any concern with ethics. On the contrary, there is a long established history of unethical behavior and shady dealings. The fact that collusion with Russia requires a lack of ethics only ensures that Trump and the campaign remain under suspicion.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.5.6. Con: The FBI tread lightly when dealing with the Trump campaign and did not alert anyone about possible collusion with the Russians for fear of being accused of throwing the election to Clinton.  They felt they had to have absolute proof which they didn't have before the election.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.6. Con: Given Trump's ability to cover up [previous scandals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/01/19/trumps-porn-star-scandal-isnt-about-the-sex/?utm_term=.bfb992439f23), and the power that the executive office would afford him to fend off punishment via pardon, the Trump campaign may have seen little to lose.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.7. Con: The Trump campaign's actions were not [necessarily illegal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/collusion-is-not-a-crime-by-itself-here-are-the-charges-mueller-could-be-exploring/2017/10/31/eb2b516e-be59-11e7-959c-fe2b598d8c00_story.html?utm_term=.3a79aa976bd7), even if they did collude, this means they might not have anticipated any legal penalties.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.8. Con: Trump has had many financial dealings with Russians. This could easily lead to a willingness to cooperate with them in the political arena.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.9. Con: The incentives not to commit any crime are high, given they are punished within the justice system. Yet people still break the law despite these disincentives.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.10. Pro: Unlike the madam secretary Hillary Clinton campaign, the Trump campaign would have no idea whether their interactions with foreign players were being monitored by Intelligence Community, so campaign members would have to be incredibly stupid to even attempt to collude with any foreign power, Russia in particular - not to mention the 24/7 media coverage of candidate Donald Trump from day one.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.10.1. Con: There is no reason to believe the Trump Campaign would be more cautious due to a lack of information on monitoring protocols.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.10.1.1. Pro: Indeed, a lack of knowledge of oversight might make someone more willing to commit crimes.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.10.2. Con: When Trump became the Republican candidate, his campaign received a [briefing by the FBI](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-to-receive-first-classified-briefing-as-presidential-candidate-at-fbi-office-a7194306.html) warning him that foreign powers \(like Russia\) may target his campaign and that he should alert the FBI if anything suspicious happens.  All campaigns receive this briefing.  Therefore, he was fully aware that the FBI was on the alert for possible activity by Russia against his campaign.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.10.3. Con: Here we have the campaign manager in jail, the national security adviser has already plead guilty for his activities during the campaign, and another campaign worker has also plead guilty to say nothing of the standing indictments. Citing the intelligence of these officials is no longer a viable defense.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.11. Con: Although there were plenty of incentives to not collude with Russia, there can be \(and probably are\) more incentives to overcome any negative impact colluding could produce.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.11.1. Pro: Profit, power, and fame.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.11.1.1. Con: Trump is already rich and famous.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.11.1.2. Con: Trump's presidency has gained him more infamy than fame.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.11.1.2.1. Con: It is unclear Trump makes this delineation.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.11.2. Pro: He could be being blackmailed, which seems pretty likely.
1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.11.3. Pro: The partially verified Steele Dossier [indicated](http://annotateddossier.com) that Trump has been cultivated as a Russian asset for years prior to his presidency
1.3.7.2.3. Pro: Highly paid Russian internet trolls [spread](http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-internet-trolls-and-donald-trump-2016-7) pro-Trump and anti-Clinton Fake News online throughout the campaign. It is likely they were funded by the Russian government.
1.3.7.2.3.1. Pro: [According to Facebook](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/russia-trump-and-2016-us-election), this kind of content, spread by a Russian-affiliated entity, reached over 140 million Facebook users.
1.3.7.2.3.2. Con: You can assume that it is the Russian government doing some activity, but what if it is simply a person who happens to be of Russian background but not at all related to the Russian government.
1.3.7.2.3.2.1. Con: It is unclear why a private group would have the financing or incentive to do this.
1.3.7.2.3.2.2. Con: Yevgeny Prigozhin, [described](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html) as "Putin's Cook" because of his state backed career and history of collaboration with the Kremlin on variety of sensitive and often [unsavory missions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html) \(like recruiting contract soldiers to fight in Ukraine and Syria\), was indicted by Mueller for financing the Internet Research Agency, the main internet troll group in question.
1.3.7.2.4. Pro: The Russian government [successfully](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/russians-penetrated-u-s-voter-systems-says-top-u-s-n845721?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma) penetrated voter rolls in multiple states, though they did not make changes to them, as far as we know.
1.3.7.2.4.1. Con: The Russian Government denies all this, and asks for proof to be shown. They say there is no proof, and only "blather."
1.3.7.2.5. Con: While it is almost universally accepted that Russia had interfered in the election, that does not mean that this interference was done with the cooperation of Trump or members of his campaign \(i.e. collusion\).
1.3.7.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.3.7.2.5.2. Con: No one here is asserting that interference means cooperation or collusion. It is recognized that correlation does not equal causation. This assertion is irrelevant to the discussion.
1.3.7.2.6. Pro: Russia, like the Soviet Union before it, has been attempting to influence American elections and exacerbate divisions among Americans since the 1950s.
1.3.7.2.6.1. Con: Russia is no longer Soviet. They are not like the old Soviet Russia. They are different. They are a growing democracy.
1.3.7.2.7. Pro: US intelligence agencies have [evidence](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national) of Russian intervention.
1.3.7.2.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.2.
1.3.7.2.7.2. Con: As Trump's team [pointed out](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/russia-trump-and-2016-us-election), US intelligence agencies also made claims, that turned out to be unsubstantiated, that "Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction".
1.3.7.2.7.2.1. Con: The Intelligence Community was [far less unified](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/12/leadup-iraq-war-timeline/) about the reports of Hussein having WMDs than they are now about Russian intervention.
1.3.7.2.7.2.2. Con: Difference is that the US was not under an eminent threat from Iraq while the evidence to support direct Russian interference into the 2016 US election is well documented and has resulted in multiple indictments.
1.3.7.2.7.3. Con: These are the same people who, as described in the GOP memo, ["the FBI abused its surveillance authority, particularly when it sought a secret court order to monitor a former Trump campaign advise"](https://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/read-the-gop-memo/2746/).
1.3.7.2.7.3.1. Con: The GOP memo actually ended up effectively proving the [legitimacy of the surveillance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/02/04/devin-nunes-tried-to-discredit-the-fbi-instead-he-proved-its-onto-something/?utm_term=.28b72a921942), by showing that the FBI acted on information from George Papadopoulos in getting a warrant on Carter Page.
1.3.7.2.7.3.2. Pro: Several representatives have called for the [appointment](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/06/gowdy-goodlatte-demand-appointment-special-counsel.html) of a second special counsel to investigate the process by which the FBI built their case against Page.
1.3.7.2.8. Pro: 13 Russians were [indicted](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/16/17020776/russian-indictments-robert-mueller) for their actions in influencing the 2016 election.
1.3.7.2.8.1. Con: While the indictment [charges](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/trump-russia-indictments-mueller-investigation-415667) the Russians in question with interfering in the election through a social media campaign, it does not claim that the outcome of the election was altered as a result.
1.3.7.2.8.1.1. Pro: Given the vast amount of information the average voter was exposed to during the campaign from various media outlets, it's highly [unlikely](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/12/28/theres-still-little-evidence-that-russias-2016-social-media-efforts-did-much-of-anything/?utm_term=.b30fb28bd944) that the Russian social media campaign the indictment is concerned with had a quantifiable impact.
1.3.7.2.8.1.2. Con: Whether or not the interference was successful has no bearing on the seriousness of the indictments, which allege that a rival power attempted to subvert the democratic process, or whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.
1.3.7.2.8.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.3.1.
1.3.7.2.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.3.
1.3.7.2.8.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.3.7.2.9. Con: Russia had more incentive to get Clinton elected than Trump. Russia already bought Uranium as a [direct](http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/12/22/uranium-one-investigation-fitton-jarrett-weigh-hannity) [result](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/22/doj-scrutiny-opens-door-to-new-uranium-one-investigation.html) of Clinton and rewarded her foundation with millions in donations.
1.3.7.2.9.1. Con: These assertions are [outright inaccurate](https://www.vox.com/2017/11/17/16658080/uranium-one-clinton-russia-chart), lies one might call them. The Uranium One deal could ONLY be authorized by the President, was approved unanimously by all members of the NRC, The Committee on Foreign Investments, the Secretaries of Treasury, State, Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce and Energy, the Attorney General and two White House staff, one Trade Rep and one from Office of Science and Tech, and made it ILLEGAL for any uranium to be exported from the US by this company.
1.3.7.2.9.1.1. Pro: The Republicans' "informant" on the Clinton Foundation's supposed links to the 2010 uranium sale turned out to have [no evidence](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-informant-had-no-evidence-clinton-benefited-from-uranium-sale-democrats-2018-3?r=UK&IR=T) whatsoever to substantiate the assertions.
1.3.7.2.9.2. Con: Putin had incentives to help Trump win the White House.
1.3.7.2.9.2.1. Pro: Hacking the US elections in any way undermines faith in US institutions, which fits into a [pattern](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/12/why_russia_is_using_the_internet_to_undermine_western_democracy.html) of recent Kremlin actions and motives. Simply put, it projects Russian power.
1.3.7.2.9.2.1.1. Pro: Authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China use flaws in democracy to justify their undemocratic governments by comparison.
1.3.7.2.9.2.1.2. Pro: Putin himself has [gloated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/putin-praises-trump-says-us-political-system-eating-itself/2018/03/07/72f426aa-21fd-11e8-946c-9420060cb7bd_story.html?utm_term=.bb0fd956238b) that the "US political system is eating itself" in the wake of the 2016 election.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2. Pro: The Russians [clearly](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/16/17021248/russian-election-interference-sanders-stein-trump) did not want Hillary Clinton to be president.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.1. Pro: Putin does not like Hillary Clinton. During her time as Secretary of State, Putin [alleged](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/clinton-putin-226153) that she was responsible for meddling in Russian domestic affairs to support Putin's opposition.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2. Pro: It is fair to assume that an experienced politician like Putin assumed he would be more able to manipulate a political novice like Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.1. Pro: During the campaign, there were scandals suggesting that those wishing to influence Trump were better served tweeting, or [leaking to the media](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/342509-new-book-devils-bargain-details-trump-lashing-out-at-manafort-days), than using traditional forms of political discussion or persuasion, e.g. memos.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.2. Pro: Putin would have known that if elected Donald Trump would be the first US president [ever](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/11/13587532/donald-trump-no-experience) with no political or military experience.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3. Con: Clinton was a known factor to Putin, because he'd dealt with her for years. Given Trump's relative opacity when articulating foreign policy and his overblown [rhetoric](http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/hardball/2017-07-03) regarding nuclear weapons, it seems an enormous risk to meddle on his behalf.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1. Con: Although Trump did not have a political background, it is likely that Putin would have known \(of\) Trump through their mutual business interests, or from Trump's pro-Putin social media presence.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: Trump has close ties with Russian oligarchs who are close to the Kremlin.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: There have been zero Russian businesses associated with Trump. Convenient assertion but factually incorrect.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Trump has made many attempts at deals in Russia, but was unable to complete them. In 2013, he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/399939505924628480?lang=en) his intention to build a "Trump Tower" in Moscow.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Multiple reporters have published multiple, well researched and supported articles about the realities of the Russian connections. The New Yorker recently published [this article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/trumps-business-of-corruption) that lists many connections.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.2. Con: Trump is a hugely successful businessman with connections all across the world. His ties to Russia are hardly unique for a man of his international stature.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con: There is little evidence that he is truly a "successful businessman." Had he simply [invested the money](http://fortune.com/2015/08/20/donald-trump-index-funds/) his father gave him he would have more money now than he does after years of his "business dealings."
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.2.2. Con: It is public knowledge, available from NY State records that the ties Trump has to Russian individuals are actually quite unique, deeply involved, and, in many cases, [highly suspect](https://nypost.com/2018/02/27/mueller-probing-trumps-pre-election-financial-ties-to-russia/).
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.3. Pro: Trump [brought](https://www.npr.org/2017/07/17/537277074/at-the-2013-miss-universe-contest-trump-met-some-of-russias-rich-and-powerful) his Miss Universe pageant to Russia in 2013 by working with Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: Agalarov's son set up the controversial June 2016 [meeting](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-russia-email-candidacy.html) in Trump Tower between key Trump team members and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.4. Pro: Trump's business have been [proven](https://www.aol.com/article/news/2018/02/21/donald-trump-jr-admitted-a-decade-ago-that-many-family-assets-come-from-russia/23367534/) to be funded extensively by Russian money.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.5. Pro: Roman Abramovich, a Russian oligarch [with ties to Putin](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/30/putin-calls-us-potential-sanctions-list-unfriendly-act/), is [good friends](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-18/billionaire-ally-of-putin-socialized-with-kushner-ivanka-trump) with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.6. Pro: Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch who the Treasury Department has [linked](http://www.newsweek.com/these-russian-oligarchs-us-treasury-list-have-ties-trump-and-his-campaign-795051) to Putin, has given large cash infusions to Trump including purchasing a home for 95 million dollars from him.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.6.1. Con: Trump has [denied](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article136939868.html) ever meeting Rybolovlev.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.6.2. Pro: Journalists have investigated why Rybolovlev's and Trump's aircrafts landed in the same cities [within an hour of each other](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article136939868.html) during three Trump campaign rallies.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.7. Pro: In 2013, Trump noted that he had a relationship with Vladimir Putin and praised his policies in a [TV interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=32&v=ZqCo8e459Vo). Trump later denied having a relationship with Putin at that time.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.8. Pro: Trump has never released his tax returns, using phony excuses as justification. This suggests that he may have ties to Russian business that he doesn't want the public to see.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.8.1. Con: It is entirely possible he wants to hide something else damaging to his reputation, such as not being as wealthy as he claims.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.8.2. Con: Trump is not legally obligated to release his tax returns. Just as we should not judge people for exercising their Fifth Amendment right, we should not judge people for exercising their right to privacy.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.8.2.1. Pro: If we believe in the concept of individual rights, it is wrong to judge people who choose to exercise those rights.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.8.3. Con: Trump does business [through](https://www.propublica.org/article/theres-no-guarantee-trumps-tax-returns-would-reveal-russia-ties) a vast number of partnerships and limited liability companies. Even if he does have dealings with Russia, they probably wouldn't be spelled out individually in his tax returns. This means it's unlikely that Trump's refusal to release his tax returns is connected to Russia.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.8.4. Pro: Eric Trump has [bragged](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/05/eric-trump-russia-investment-golf-course) about having "all the money they need out of Russia."
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.8.5. Pro: Trump's justification for not releasing his tax returns is that he is under [audit](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1421/release-his-tax-returns-after-audit-completed/) by the IRS. Yet this does not preclude him from releasing his tax returns.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.8.4.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.10. Pro: Trump's longtime lawyer Michael Cohen is under [FBI investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/us/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump.html) in relation to the Russia probe.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.10.1. Pro: Cohen once [bragged](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/30/trump-campaign-michael-cohen-legal-bills-560660) he was part of the Russian mob.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.10.2. Pro: According to a memo released by Michael Avenatti \(the lawyer representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in her suit against Trump\), Cohen [received](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/xwmq53/trump-cohen-dossier-avenatti-oligarch-russia) a 500,000 USD payment from Columbus Nova, a company tied to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, shortly after the 2016 election.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.1. Pro: Mueller is aware of the Cohen-Vekselberg connection. Vekselberg has been [questioned](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/viktor-vekselberg-mueller-investigation.html) in relation to the Russia probe.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.2. Con: The Trump administration has imposed [sanctions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/world/europe/russian-oligarchs-sanctions.html) on Vekselberg and the Renova Group, his company.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.3. Pro: Vekselberg's cousin, Andrew Intrater, is the [head](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-porn-lawyer-russian-att-trump-20180508-story.html) of Columbus Nova.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.10.2.4. Pro: Avenatti's memo also [claims](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-did-major-companies-pay-trumps-personal-lawyer-through-a-shell-company) several major international corporations, including telecommunications company AT&T, pharmaceutical firm Novartis, and aircraft manufacturer Korean Aerospace, also made payments to Michael Cohen. All of these corporations have confirmed they indeed made the respective payments, bolstering the memo's legitimacy.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.11. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.9.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.12. Pro: Trump has spent three [decades](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-business.html) trying to obtain real estate deals in Russia.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.12.1. Pro: Trump associate Sergei Millan was [involved](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-trump-political-conflict-zone/story?id=42263092) in selling Trump condos in Russia.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.12.2. Pro: During the [presidential campaign](https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/28/politics/trump-tower-plan-moscow-during-election/index.html), Trump was still looking to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.13. Con: Close ties with oligarchs in Russia, even if they exist, does not prove that Trump colluded with Russia to affect the 2016 election.
1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.3.7.2.9.2.3. Pro: Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state saw the end of the post-Cold War thaw between Russian-American relations.
1.3.7.2.9.2.4. Con: Trump ran on a platform that emphasized both energy independence and the increased use of American military power abroad. Both of these campaign promises run counter to Putin's strategic goals.
1.3.7.2.9.2.4.1. Pro: Russia has been [funding](http://www.newsweek.com/putin-funding-green-groups-discredit-natural-gas-fracking-635052) anti-fracking and anti-oil groups in the US for years.
1.3.7.2.9.2.4.2. Con: While Trump may have emphasised energy independence and increased use of American military power abroad, Trump was [well criticised](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/05/the-brilliant-incoherence-of-trumps-foreign-policy/521430/) for his many, and often contradictory campaign promises. It is difficult to isolate any 'true' platform or goals regarding Trump's intended foreign policy.
1.3.7.2.9.2.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.
1.3.7.2.9.2.5. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.
1.3.7.2.9.3. Con: No Uranium has gone from America to Russia.  A Russian mining company bought a Canadian mining company that owns a Uranium mine in America with no export license. This sale was approved by an interagency review process that included the State Department, but did not include the direct involvement of Hillary Clinton.
1.3.7.2.10. Pro: Trump agrees Russia hacked the election. Saying in a January 2017 [press conference](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html): "As far as hacking, I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people."
1.3.7.2.10.1. Con: Trump might be making the same mistake as everyone else when he assumes that just because a Russian person or a Russian IP address was linked to some sort of hacking activity, that it means it was the "Russian Government".
1.3.7.2.11. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.9.2.
1.3.7.2.12. Con: It is not generally agreed upon. It happens to be the biggest assumption of a propaganda campaign against Russia in the Mainstream media that many people base their opinions on in USA, Canada, Europe, Australia perhaps, but to say that it is generally agreed upon is the hinge point of this debate.
1.3.7.2.12.1. Con: All of the US intelligence agencies have agreed that Russia meddled in the 2016 US elections.
1.3.7.2.13. Pro: Russian online campaigns also [backed](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/16/17021248/russian-election-interference-sanders-stein-trump) Clinton's other opponents in the 2016 race, Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein.
1.3.7.2.13.1. Con: If Russia was supporting other candidates in addition to Trump, it weakens the case for his direct involvement with Russia's plans as it means he was not their only interest.
1.3.7.2.13.2. Con: This point could just as easily be construed as indication for Russian collusion with candidates Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein, and is therefore not a clear or likely indicator of collusion by the three candidates.
1.3.7.2.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.1.2.
1.3.7.2.14. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.1.1.
1.3.7.2.15. Pro: Numerous private cybersecurity firms have confirmed that Russian hackers were behind the attacks on the Democratic National Committee, including [CrowdStrike](https://www.npr.org/2016/12/14/505592238/cybersecurity-firm-confirms-russian-hackers-breached-the-dnc), [Fidelis Cybersecurity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cyber-researchers-confirm-russian-government-hack-of-democratic-national-committee/2016/06/20/e7375bc0-3719-11e6-9ccd-d6005beac8b3_story.html?utm_term=.f84c6fda7f60), and [Mandiant](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-russia-theory/u-s-theory-on-democratic-party-breach-hackers-meant-to-leave-russias-mark-idUSKCN10801S).
1.3.7.2.15.1. Con: The emails released were from Wikileaks. Assange has said [repeatedly](https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/04/politics/assange-wikileaks-hannity-intv/index.html) they did not come from Russia. Wikileaks has yet to be shown wrong.
1.3.7.2.15.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.2.
1.3.7.2.15.1.2. Con: Wikileaks has a history of [lying](https://gizmodo.com/julian-assange-lied-about-a-wikileaks-data-dump-on-nati-1785091653).
1.3.7.2.15.1.3. Con: Wikileaks and Donald Trump Jr had [repeated correspondence](https://www.kialo.com/did-the-trump-campaign-collude-with-russia-9004/9004.0=9004.1-9004.27+9004.83-9004.617/-9004.617/comments) prior to the release of the DNC emails.
1.3.7.2.15.1.3.1. Con: Trump could not have known the contents of the DNC's internal communications, or whether there was any damning evidence against the DNC contained therein, until after the hack had already occurred and the information had already leaked. The sequence of events was therefore outside of his control, regardless of whether the leaked emails benefited his campaign.
1.3.7.2.15.1.4. Con: The United States Intelligence Community has determined that they did come from the Russian Government: [www.dni.gov](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) The United States Intelligence Community is far more credible than Julian Assange, who is effectively a Trump supporter and thus has an incentive to lie about this.
1.3.7.2.15.1.5. Con: It's naive to take anyone at their own words. They don't constitute proof.
1.3.7.2.15.2. Con: Crowdstrike is a DNC affiliated firm.
1.3.7.2.15.2.1. Pro: CrowdStrike additionally cast blame on Russia when it was hired to determine the source of a Ukranian military hack. Russian involvement has since been [debunked](https://medium.com/\@jeffreycarr/the-gru-ukraine-artillery-hack-that-may-never-have-happened-820960bbb02d), further calling both the firm's neutrality and competence into question.
1.3.7.2.15.2.2. Con: The fact that CrowdStrike was the firm initially hired by the DNC to investigate the hacking of their servers does not by itself disprove that Russia was the source, nor does it call into question the validity of the [five](https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/guccifer-2-0-dnc-breach/) [other](https://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/wp/wp-two-years-of-pawn-storm.pdf) [firms](https://www.secureworks.com/research/threat-group-4127-targets-hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign) [which](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3086314/security/russian-hackers-were-behind-dnc-breach-says-fidelis-cybersecurity.html) [corroborated](https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/solutions/pdfs/st-senate-intel-committee-russia-election.pdf) this conclusion.
1.3.7.2.16. Pro: Russia is known for [election interference](http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-russia-election-meddling-20170330-story.html) in many countries with the same type of techniques.
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.2.
1.5. Con: Numerous claims by the left regarding collusion have been proven untrue.
1.5.1. Pro: Many such accusations have been based on the Steele dossier, which was [funded](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/01/russia-steele-dossier-democrats-republicans-216921) in part by the Clinton campaign.
1.5.1.1. Con: Opposition research is a legitimate source, especially when first [initiated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-dossier-paul-singer.html) by GOP and conducted by a reliable expert.
1.5.1.2. Con: As a raw HUMINT document, the Steele dossier [should be viewed](https://medium.com/\@aseanneville/christopher-steele-and-the-trump-dossier-how-to-interpret-736e44cd9549) by [the public](https://www.justsecurity.org/44697/steele-dossier-knowing/) as ["lead information only, that is, a jumping-off point for additional investigation"](http://observer.com/2017/10/fact-versus-fiction-in-the-steele-dossier-on-donald-trump/) \(albeit from an intelligence collector with a reputation for credible work\), and various nat sec experts believe that this is how the Special Counsel investigation has treated the dossier as well.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Where the grandparent claim references accusations made in the Steele dossier, it does not take into account the possibility \([taken seriously](http://observer.com/2017/10/fact-versus-fiction-in-the-steele-dossier-on-donald-trump/) by some experts\) that some deliberate disinformation by the Kremlin made it into the dossier without Steele's or his sources' awareness.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: Not all sources for the dossier were Russians, and Steele is likely knowledgeable enough to assess a source's credibility.
1.5.2. Pro: The claim that Russia hacked vote-counting machines and manipulated the election day results remains totally unwarranted.
1.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.4.
1.5.2.2. Pro: [Jill Stein](https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/11/23/13738758/jill-stein-election-fundraising) launched a recount campaign premised on the claim that Trump benefited from vote tampering. When the recounts were done, however, they resulted in only [marginal changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_recounts) to the total tally.
1.5.2.3. Con: Leaked NSA reports confirm that Russia targeted [122 local officials](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/05/531649602/report-russia-launched-cyberattack-on-voting-vendor-ahead-of-election) in email "phishing" attacks that could have impacted election results in [over 39 states](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-13/russian-breach-of-39-states-threatens-future-u-s-elections).
1.5.2.4. Con: The lack of paper ballots in many states means that it would be [extremely difficult](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/14/532824432/if-voting-machines-were-hacked-would-anyone-know) to detect a successful remote hacking on our voting machines and counting process.
1.5.3. Con: "The left" is far too broad of a term to establish credibility.  If I call Alex Jones "the right" then I can discredit every Republican alive because they are also "the right".
1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.15.1.
1.5.6. Con: The fact that your critics have issued false accusations does not disprove other accusations, which should be assessed based on their own evidence.
1.5.6.1. Con: It is sensible to look at the historical accuracy of an accuser's claims when judging their legitimacy.
1.5.7. Pro: [CNN](https://www.mediaite.com/online/wapo-cnn-misreported-wikileaks-providing-trump-access-to-email-tranche/) erroneously said that the Trump campaign was given advance access to material later shared by Wikileaks.
1.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.15.1.3.
1.5.7.2. Con: Trump campaign adviser, Roger Stone, has [close ties](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/02/politics/roger-stone-wikileaks-meeting-special-counsel/index.html), possible information sharing, and coordination with Wikileaks.
1.6. Con: Jared Kushner has said that the Trump Campaign was "[too disorganized to collude.](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/07/31/kusher-to-interns-trump-team-too-disorganized-to-collude-with-russia/)"
1.6.1. Con: A disorganized campaign provides an excellent diversion to draw attention away from people who know how to quietly get things done.
1.6.2. Con: It is highly improbable that the Trump campaign was both organised enough to win the presidential election while still running a multinational business yet they were not capable of colluding with Russia.
1.6.3. Pro: Although it is possible that some members of the campaign may have talked to Russian officials, this is not sufficient to meet the bar for collusion.
1.6.3.1. Con: This fundamentally misunderstands the legal threshold that must be met to qualify as "collusion" or in more appropriate legal terms, "Conspiracy to defraud the United States of America". They don't have to be good at it. They don't have to be successful at it. They simply have to know about it and either allow it to continue or material assist in any way.
1.6.3.2. Con: An assertion with no support. The evidence of contact before and during the campaign is mounting and the twisted business ties the Trump organization has with Russian businesses and individuals means that there are many different avenues of contact that are not immediately visible.
1.6.3.3. Con: Kushner, Manafort, and Trump Jr. [met](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html) with a Kremlin-connected lawyer at Trump Tower during the summer of 2016.
1.6.3.3.1. Pro: The lawyer who met with Don Jr. has now admitted to being a Kremlin operative.  [www.nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/us/natalya-veselnitskaya-trump-tower-russian-prosecutor-general.html)
1.6.4. Con: This essentially argues that, even if individual members of the campaign knowingly colluded, that does not constitute collusion by the campaign itself. What percentage of the campaign staff, then, has to be in on it for it to be the business of the campaign? 5%? 50%?
1.6.5. Con: Jared Kushner has an incentive to lie in order to cover up his own [involvement](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/1/17053398/jared-kushner-scandals-russia-clearance-loans) in the Russia scandal and others.
1.6.6. Pro: Pretty much every member of the Trump team was wildly inexperienced.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Former foreign policy advisor George Papadopolous [listed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/03/21/meet-the-men-shaping-donald-trumps-foreign-policy-views/?utm_term=.1ce764769608) Model UN on his resume.
1.6.6.2. Con: Given that Trump's family members are capable of running a multinational business \(part of their sales pitch\) with many varied ties to Russia, it is improbable that they would be unable to coordinate something like this.
1.6.6.3. Pro: Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, had [never](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/man-behind-donald-trump-run-lewandowski-120443) run a national campaign of this scale before.
1.6.6.4. Con: The most experienced member was [Paul Manafort](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/paul-manafort-american-hustler/550925/), who has very close relationships with, and owed money to, Russian oligarchs.
1.6.6.5. Con: This inexperience may have led them to think they could get away with talking with the Russians.
1.6.6.6. Pro: Even Trump's close ally Roger Stone [criticized](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/ex-trump-consultant-slams-trumps-inexperienced-campaign/article/2570104) Trump's campaign as "inexperienced" following a number high-profile confrontations between Trump staff and reporters.
1.6.7. Con: Only the Russians need to be "organized" in the process of collusion for it to work.  The Trump campaign need only follow the Russians lead.
1.7. Con: Russia’s meddling in the election started as early as [2014](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/16/politics/mueller-russia-indictments-election-interference/index.html), long before Trump was a declared candidate, before the first primary and caucus votes had been cast, before there was any certainty Trump was going to be the nominee.
1.7.1. Con: This does not mean the Trump Campaign did not jump onto the existing plan once the Russians expressed their support for Trump.
1.7.2. Con: In 2014, Russia was engaged in [sowing general discord](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-muellers-indictment-reveals-about-russias-internet-research-agency) and the disruption of the American electoral process. When Trump emerged as a leading contender, the Russian mission would have changed its focus to aid Trump and harm Hillary.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Beginning In 2014, Trump strangely [tweeted](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/trump-tweeted-nine-times-to-deleted-russian-twitte.html) at several Russian twitter accounts regarding his intentions to run for president.
1.7.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.13.
1.7.3. Con: Trump trademarked Make America Great Again in [late 2012](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-donald-trump-came-up-with-make-america-great-again/2017/01/17/fb6acf5e-dbf7-11e6-ad42-f3375f271c9c_story.html?utm_term=.b98bdfeeacb6), specifying its use for political purposes. It's not at all implausible that a campaign was planned as early as 2014 and was simply not public knowledge.
1.7.4. Con: On Feb. 12, Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/963152799486828544), "The journey to #MAGA began \@CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year. See you at #CPAC2018!". This implies he was seriously considering running for President as early as 2011.
1.7.5. Con: Governments will always use espionage when given the opportunity. Trump's Russian connections and his many business deals with Russian nationals make him and his campaign the perfect opportunity, regardless of when these efforts started.
1.7.5.1. Pro: This suggests that Trump was the product of Russian intervention, not the instigator. It's still collusion if the campaign knowingly follows the lead of foreign actors.
1.7.6. Con: Russia could have contacted Trump at any point in their efforts to disrupt the American election.
1.7.7. Con: The timing of Russian influence in an election is irrelevant to whether collusion with a candidate occurred at any specific time.
1.7.8. Con: The fact that Russia's influencing of the election started before Trump was a candidate, does not exonerate Trump. It is very possible that they started meddling and then later also colluded with \(or blackmailed\) Trump.
1.7.9. Pro: Russians were grooming Trump for [5 years](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier) before the 2016 election.
1.7.9.1. Pro: The Steele Dossier is not a trustworthy authority on Trump's relationship \(or lack thereof\) with Russia. Former FBI Director James Comey said [he "isn’t sure”](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/comey-believes-source-steele-dossier-credible/story?id=54488781) how much of the information in the dossier checked out. “The answer is, I don't know,” he said. But when asked if he thought the document was credible, Comey only referred to its source \(Christopher Steele\): “Well, certainly the source was credible."
1.8. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.9.2.2.2.3.1.1.
1.9. Con: This story is a media creation designed to hurt President Trump.
1.9.1. Pro: Trump himself has denounced the investigation, [tweeting:](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/875305788708974592) "They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice".
1.9.1.1. Con: Trump is [known](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html) to attack whomever opposes him.
1.9.1.2. Con: Trump is known to use [falsehoods](http://time.com/5084420/donald-trump-lies-claims-fact-checks/). His statements should not be taken as truth without the evidence to back them up.
1.9.1.3. Con: Denial is the first step in the five stages of grief, and is an expected response from a guilty party.
1.9.2. Pro: Trump has called the [investigation](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/865173176854204416?lang=en) "the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history."
1.9.2.1. Con: He also has [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/us/politics/trump-russia-mueller.html) that he is not under investigation.
1.9.2.2. Con: -> See 1.9.1.2.
1.9.2.3. Con: This is simply a claim by somebody who may or may not be guilty of the crime. It doesn't constitute a proof whatsoever.
1.9.3. Pro: President Putin also [denies](http://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/vladimir-putin-scoffs-at-invented-claims-russia-colluded-with-donald-trump-during-us-election/news-story/f85c0ac327e6b4cf1fd2442e294129c0) collusion, stating that the story "was invented by people who oppose President Trump to undermine his legitimacy".
1.9.3.1. Con: We should be wary of trusting the word of a former [KGB officer](http://www.businessinsider.com/vladimir-putin-kgb-spy-2017-9) whose job it was to deceive Americans; a game he still plays exceptionally well.
1.9.3.2. Con: While initially Putin denied any type of Russian involvement unequivocally, he has since [opined](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/world/europe/vladimir-putin-donald-trump-hacking.html?action=Click&contentCollection=BreakingNews&contentID=65381707&pgtype=Homepage&_r=0&referer=https://t.co/abCC9YMPRb) that private Russian hackers may have been behind the DNC leaks. This suggests he recognizes that Russian involvement in the leaks is too obvious for blanket denials, and is instead trying to deflect suspicion from his government.
1.9.3.2.1. Pro: Putin has since [elaborated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-10/putin-on-alleged-us-election-interference-i-don-t-care) that he believes it's possible "Ukranians, Tatars, and Jews" were behind the hacking.
1.9.3.3. Con: The President of Russia has strong incentives to deny that he colluded with Trump, regardless of whether he did.
1.9.3.3.1. Con: Putin also desires to project strength abroad. Backing, colluding with, and ultimately electing a reality TV star to the presidency of a rival great power is something that he'd want to boast about. It implies a fundamental weakness in America's democratic process.
1.9.3.3.1.1. Con: Having everyone assume he did it, but not confirming it publicly, accomplishes nearly the same goals as openly bragging.
1.9.3.3.1.2. Con: The US's democratic system imploding on its own would make it look worse than if Russia had to interfere to break it.
1.9.4. Con: -> See 1.1.11.
1.9.5. Con: There have been multiple indictments in an ongoing investigation. There is no administration in [history](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/1/11/1619079/-Comparing-Presidential-Administrations-by-Arrests-and-Convictions-A-Warning-for-Trump-Appointees) with this much legal trouble this soon after it began.
1.9.6. Pro: The media needs to have material to fuel the 24 hour news cycle and this story is dramatic and interesting, so it sells.
1.9.6.1. Con: This claim does not actually support the previous claim and is simply a speculative motive with no evidentiary link to the action in the previous claim.
1.9.6.2. Pro: In 2017, a year dominated by Trump-Russia coverage, both CNN and MSNBC [improved](http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-cable-ratings-yearend-20171229-story.html) on their record viewership numbers generated by the 2016 election. They have every incentive to portray Trump's alleged Russia connections in the most dramatic light.
1.9.6.2.1. Con: Neither CNN nor MSNBC, individually or combined, comprise "The Media" as a holistic entity and therefore do not justify the original claim made \(which is no more than a red herring with no supporting evidence\). Nor does increased viewership \(for any number of factors\) in 2017 exonerate Trump for collusion in 2016. Furthermore, increased viewership in 2017 in no way provides evidence of a plot to "create" the story of collusion in the first place. This claim is not logical.
1.9.6.3. Con: The "Deep State" colluding to damage Trump would make a great story as well.
1.9.6.4. Con: The media does not have the power to launch an FBI investigation, appoint a special prosecutor, or impanel a grand jury. MSNBC did not indict Manafort and Gates.
1.9.6.4.1. Con: The media has the power to concentrate pressure on government institutions forcing them to take actions on issues that might not warrant action without said pressure.
1.9.6.4.1.1. Con: Regardless of whether or not this true, a foreign power intervening in American elections with the intent of subverting the democratic process is hardly something that does not warrant investigation.
1.9.6.4.1.2. Con: Pressure yes, force no.
1.9.6.4.1.2.1. Con: There is no meaningful distinction between pressuring someone to do something, and forcing someone to do something.
1.9.6.4.1.3. Con: The FBI investigation started [before](https://www.kialo.com/did-trump-collude-with-russia-9004/9004.0=9004.1-9004.4-9004.545-9004.643-9004.790/-9004.790/comments) the media was covering the story.  The media has been reacting to the investigation, not vice versa.
1.9.6.4.1.3.1. Con: Christopher Steele [leaked](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/02/01/what-is-in-the-nunes-memo-fbi-released-analysis/) information to the media, in order to corroborate his story, and hence convince a judge to continue the investigation.
1.9.6.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: FBI Deputy Director McCabe [testified](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/02/01/what-is-in-the-nunes-memo-fbi-released-analysis/) before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.
1.9.6.4.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: This means that without the media publishing Steele's leaked information, the warrants required to continue the investigation would never have been attained.
1.9.7. Con: Media creations do not lead to [guilty pleas](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/michael-flynn-guilty-russia-investigation.html) and cooperating witnesses.
1.9.7.1. Con: Pleading guilty to perjury, or obstruction of justice, does not mean collusion occurred. People are often caught out on perjury charges.
1.9.7.2. Con: Flynn has an incentive to support a narrative of collusion in order to secure immunity or a plea deal from the special investigation.
1.9.7.2.1. Con: Michael Flynn has a long career of public service, and the fact that he has pleaded guilty should show that he doesn't hold himself above the law.
1.9.7.2.2. Con: He had to take a plea because the case against him was very strong.
1.9.7.2.3. Pro: That is true. Because there was [overwhelming evidence](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mueller-has-enough-evidence-bring-charges-flynn-investigation-n817666) of his guilt.
1.9.8. Con: -> See 1.3.6.
1.9.9. Con: -> See 1.9.6.4.
1.9.10. Pro: The media has a left-leaning bias and pushes stories which hurt Trump.
1.9.10.1. Pro: Rich Noyes, director of research for the Media Research Centre [states](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/rich-noyes/2017/12/12/even-media-whine-about-trump-their-hostile-coverage-shows-no-let), "The media have approached the Trump presidency with unrelenting hostility.”
1.9.10.1.1. Con: Rich Noyes and the [Media Research Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Research_Center) are explicitly conservative.
1.9.10.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.4.
1.9.10.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.3.1.
1.9.10.3. Pro: News reports about President Trump are [disproportionately](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/02/555092743/study-news-coverage-of-trump-more-negative-than-for-other-presidents) more negative than past presidents.
1.9.10.3.1. Con: Donald Trump's words and actions have made him unpopular.
1.9.10.4. Con: Television, the primary political news source in the US, is dominated by conservative media.
1.9.10.4.1. Pro: Fox News is the [most-watched](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/02/trump-biased-liberal-media-television) cable news channel nationally.
1.9.10.4.2. Pro: The pro-Trump Sinclair Media Group is the [largest](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/17/sinclair-news-media-fox-trump-white-house-circa-breitbart-news) broadcast company in the United States, with local affiliate stations that reach [70 percent](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/06/trump-fcc-sinclair-broadcast-expansion-241337) of American households.
1.9.10.5. Con: According to [public opinion polls](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-year-in-trumps-approval-rating/) Trump is the most unpopular president in recorded history. The media is no more biased against Trump than the general public.
1.9.10.5.1. Con: The media is designed to be objective, not mirror public opinion.
1.9.10.6. Pro: Only [7 percent](https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/05/survey-7-percent-of-reporters-identify-as-republican-188053) of journalists identify as Republicans.
1.9.10.6.1. Con: Republicans are [hostile](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xz3q4/a-body-slammed-reporter-and-the-new-american-war-on-journalism) toward journalists.
1.9.10.6.1.1. Con: Vice \(the publication which is cited above\) is a publication with a [left-wing](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vice-news/) bias.
1.9.10.6.1.1.1. Pro: Left wing publications stand to benefit by smearing their opposition as "hostile to the media."
1.9.10.6.1.1.1.1. Con: The right wing has a motive to label any fact that undermines their beliefs as bias when it is, in fact, just reality.
1.9.10.6.1.1.2. Pro: Left-wing publications are more likely to find republicans \(whom they disagree with\) hostile, than democrats \(who they agree with\).
1.9.10.6.1.1.2.1. Con: A critical free press is antithetical to the goals of the American far-right.
1.9.10.6.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Since much of their platform is very unpopular, the more aware the general public is of their goals, the worse for them.
1.9.10.6.1.1.2.2. Con: The American right-wing labels any outlet that doesn't actively support right-wing candidates and policies to point of repeating proscribed talking points as left-wing.
1.9.10.6.1.1.3. Con: Many sources which are perceived as right wing \(like [Rasmussen](http://m.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/june_2017/76_of_gop_voters_believe_most_reporters_biased_against_trump) and [Fox News](http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/05/25/harvard-harris-poll-majority-americans-think-mainstream-media-publishes-fake-news)\) also agree that Republicans resent the mainstream media.
1.9.10.6.1.1.3.1. Pro: Fox News was [explicitly founded](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-roger-ailes-polarized-tv-news/) because people perceived the 'main-stream media' as being liberally biased.
1.9.10.6.1.1.4. Con: Whether or not they are biased does not change the [veracity](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vice-news/) of the content in the article.
1.9.10.6.1.2. Pro: When Trump supporter and Montana representative Greg Gianforte [body-slammed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/05/25/fox-news-crew-watched-in-disbelief-as-gianforte-slammed-and-punched-reporter/?utm_term=.bb6eed2c24e7) a reporter during his campaign for the House of Representatives, his future Republican colleagues [refused](https://www.vox.com/2017/5/25/15691988/political-reporters-under-attack-conservative-voters-greg-gianforte-ben-jacobs) to denounce him, and he [won](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/montana-house-special-election) the vote shortly after.
1.9.10.7. Pro: During the 2016 race, only [3 percent](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-really-was-a-liberal-media-bubble/) of major newspapers that offered endorsements for presidential candidates endorsed Trump.
1.9.10.7.1. Con: This is simply indicative of Trump's general unpopularity as a candidate, not a wider anti-Republican bias. By comparison, Mitt Romney [received](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/2012_newspaper_endorsements.php) numerous high-profile newspaper endorsements in 2012.
1.9.11. Con: There is no evidence that the media conspired to manufacture a story to hurt Trump.
1.10. Con: The investigation into the Trump Campaign's collusion with Russia is a partisan attack.
1.10.1. Con: The motivation of the public's potential bias has no bearing on whether Trump colluded with Russia.
1.10.2. Pro: The investigation is riddled with mistakes, impropriety and bias.
1.10.2.1. Pro: The bias of FBI source Christopher Steele has tainted the investigation.
1.10.2.1.1. Pro: Steele leaked documents he had collected to Yahoo News, in order to fool the FBI into believing his findings were corroborated by other [sources.](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/feb/4/fbi-authorized-christopher-steele-payments-dossier/)
1.10.2.1.1.1. Pro: Fusion GPS, the organisation which employed Steele \(and was funded by the Clinton Campaign\), assisted Steele in [leaking](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2018/02/01/what-is-in-the-nunes-memo-fbi-released-analysis/) his information to news sites.
1.10.2.1.2. Con: The warrant application was [based on](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/2/16965086/nunes-memo-dud-release) information from George Papadopoulos, not the Steele Dossier.
1.10.2.1.3. Pro: Christopher Steele was strongly [ideologically opposed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/02/donald-trump-approves-release-controversial-memo/) to Trump, stating he "was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president."
1.10.2.1.3.1. Con: It seems rather clear that Steele developed his personal anti-Trump bias once he had done his [research](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/05/christopher-steele-dossier-smearing-216940).
1.10.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Any reasonable person who discovers improper behaviors from another person would be expected to develop "biases" against that person moving into a position of political power.
1.10.2.1.4. Con: -> See 1.10.2.1.3.1.
1.10.2.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.9.6.4.1.3.1.1.
1.10.2.2. Pro: The FBI misled a FISA court in order to obtain a warrant to spy on Trump Advisor Carter Page.
1.10.2.2.1. Pro: The FBI failed to disclose that the source of most of their evidence - Investigator Christopher Steele, had been [hired](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/clinton-campaign-dnc-paid-for-research-that-led-to-russia-dossier/2017/10/24/226fabf0-b8e4-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html?utm_term=.12044c820601) by Fusion GPS, on behalf of the Clinton Campaign, to dig up dirt on Trump.
1.10.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.10.2.1.2.
1.10.2.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.2.1.3.
1.10.2.2.1.3. Con: The FBI has had an [interest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/memo-points-to-fbis-ongoing-interest-in-trump-adviser-carter-page/2018/02/02/89bfdee2-077c-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html?utm_term=.b6366c71464f) in Carter Page since 2013, based on his extensive contact with suspected Russian spies. This proves they were not solely reliant on the dossier in terms of evidence.
1.10.2.2.1.4. Con: Even if Steele was biased and his research was the primary source used to obtain the FISA warrant, this does not invalidate his materials as evidence. Evaluating the veracity of biased sources is part of the FBI's job. The fact that they undertook an effort to corroborate the information, regardless of the initial source\(s\), reveals competence, not corruption.
1.10.2.2.2. Con: The warrant targeted Carter Page [after](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/2/16965086/nunes-memo-dud-release) he left the Trump campaign. An FBI campaign to undermine Trump’s campaign would almost certainly involve targeting someone who was actually working on it.
1.10.2.2.3. Con: According to [national security law practitioners](https://lawfareblog.com/friends-court-suggestion-fisa-court-nunes-memo), whether the FISA application was valid or invalid, truthful or misleading, is not ultimately the call of anyone in Congress to make, not even a committee chair - it is the FISC judges' call only.
1.10.2.2.4. Con: After obtaining the initial warrant, the FBI [received](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/02/nunes-memo-fisa-trump-russia/) three extensions to continue monitoring Page. These extensions necessitated that the FBI show the FISA court that Page's communications themselves contained tangible foreign intelligence, meaning they could not have been solely reliant on the Steele dossier.
1.10.2.2.5. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.7.3.1.
1.10.2.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.2.7.3.2.
1.10.2.3. Pro: Peter Strzok, the agent who opened the investigation into Russian collusion, is heavily [biased](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/peter-strzok-clinton-emails-trump-russia-investigation-mueller-2017-12?r=US&IR=T) against Trump.
1.10.2.3.1. Pro: Leaked text messages have [revealed](https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/xwvv83/these-flirty-trump-hating-texts-between-fbi-agents-are-kind-of-adorable) that Peter Strzok, then a member of Mueller's team, was extremely hostile to Trump, calling him a "loathsome human" and also "this man cannot be President."
1.10.2.3.1.1. Con: [Many Republicans](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/where-republicans-stand-on-donald-trump-a-cheat-sheet/481449/) have said similar things about Donald Trump.
1.10.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.4.
1.10.2.3.2. Con: Peter Strzok also [advocated](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/31/politics/strzok-fbi-comey-clinton-letter/index.html) the reopening of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and drafted the letter James Comey sent to Congress just before the election.
1.10.2.3.2.1. Con: Peter Strzok [reworded](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/peter-strzok-clinton-emails-trump-russia-investigation-mueller-2017-12?r=US&IR=T) Comey's statement to Congress, removing the words "grossly negligent" \(which would indicate Clinton was criminally liable\) and replacing them with "extremely careless."
1.10.2.4. Pro: As a result of Trump's attacks on the efficacy of intelligence agencies, agents may have a bias against him.
1.10.2.4.1. Con: This logic would make the president above the law because having committed a crime POTUS could criticize the investigative body and then claim the investigation is a personal vendetta rather than a legitimate investigation of the crime.
1.10.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.10.2.6. Con: Investigators [can](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-12/pssst-crime-may-be-near-an-all-time-low) and should be able to have private political opinions.
1.10.2.6.1. Con: Indications of political bias among investigators [undermine](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-24/fbi-agents-have-to-zip-it-in-this-political-climate) confidence in the justice system.
1.10.2.6.2. Con: Whether or not it is a right, bias among investigators can be an indicator of an illegitimate investigation.
1.10.2.6.3. Pro: Investigators are human and cannot help having an opinion. As long as they do not influence their actions, they are not to blame.
1.10.2.7. Con: No mistakes have been found. Both Comey and Mueller are Republicans, making any political motivations unlikely.
1.10.3. Con: The FBI is a [non-partisan organization](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/05/12/donald-trump-fbi-kelly-ayotte-john-cornyn-215130) with high level employees from both political parties, who assess all information that comes across their desks based only on its credibility.
1.10.3.1. Con: The FBI may technically be nonpartisan, but it has a long history of weaponizing information for [political purposes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-the-fbi/2016/11/04/ac08f73e-a1fe-11e6-a44d-cc2898cfab06_story.html?utm_term=.8f66018d2cba).
1.10.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.
1.10.5. Pro: Democrats, liberals, and other opponents of Trump have strong incentives to give credibility to the collusion theory.
1.10.5.1. Pro: Inspiring doubt among the public regarding the validity of Trump's electoral mandate cuts at Trump's support and ability to carry out policies which liberals oppose.
1.10.5.1.1. Con: This statement is immaterial to the Trump campaign's guilt or innocence.
1.10.5.2. Pro: Claiming that Trump is a Russian puppet who directly threatens democracy offers Democrats a powerful narrative with which to inspire their base to turn out for the 2018 midterms.
1.10.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.10.5.1.1.
1.10.5.3. Pro: Trump has made a number of [disparaging](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/06/28/why-donald-trump-calls-elizabeth-warren-pocahontas/?utm_term=.a620a83b0615) [statements](http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-36949974/trump-calls-clinton-the-devil) about Clinton and other prominent members of the Democratic Party, and won an election that was widely regarded as Clinton's inevitable victory. There is a personal element of animosity against him in the Democratic Party that motivates their pushing of this narrative.
1.10.5.3.1. Con: No matter what incentives and motivations the Democratic Party has, they have no ability to influence the probe.
1.10.5.3.2. Con: The Trump/Russia narrative is manifest in the reality of Donald Trump's actions and has its in origin in the American intelligence services not the Democratic party.  This is a Republican DOJ and a Republican special prosecutor.  The Democratic party is currently running zero branches of government.
1.10.5.4. Con: Incentive does not negate the credibility of the evidence. For example, Bill Clinton's political opponents had incentive to investigate evidence that he had lied under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinski. The fact that they had incentive did not negate the credibility of the evidence they found. Thus, this is not a valid argument.
1.10.5.5. Pro: The Democratic Party is [divided](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/26/the-liberal-left-divide-reshaping-american-politics) between leftist Sanders supporters and the establishment wing that backed Clinton. These groups have contrasting views on health care, foreign policy, and other key positions. The portrayal of Trump as a Russian puppet helps unify their fractious base around a shared loathing for him.
1.10.6. Con: Trump supporters tend to view anything that does not actively support Trump \(or a Republican agenda\) as an attack. This includes media, scientists, fellow Republican politicians, judges, and many large segments of the American population.
1.10.6.1. Con: -> See 1.9.10.
1.10.7. Pro: The allegations that are being made against Trump could equally be made against Clinton. Yet, only one candidate has been investigated for collusion, which suggests bias.
1.10.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.9.
1.10.7.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.
1.10.7.3. Con: The sheer number of interactions between Trump officials and Russian agents and lies about the interactions makes an innocent explanation seem far-fetched.
1.10.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.
1.10.7.3.2. Pro: At least [eight members](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/01/us/trump-associates-russia-election.html) of the Trump team have communicated with the Russians.
1.10.7.3.2.1. Pro: Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater and brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, set up a secret backdoor [channel](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/blackwater-founder-held-secret-seychelles-meeting-to-establish-trump-putin-back-channel/2017/04/03/95908a08-1648-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html?utm_term=.6a3901ab8f0c), apparently for the Trump administration to communicate with Russia, in the Seychelles islands.
1.10.7.3.2.1.1. Pro: George Nader, a business associate of Prince's who helped set up the meeting, is [cooperating](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/7/17088908/erik-prince-trump-russia-seychelles-mueller) with the Mueller investigation. He has allegedly verified that Prince's goal was communication with Russia on behalf of Trump.
1.10.7.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: This [contradicts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mueller-gathers-evidence-that-2016-seychelles-meeting-was-effort-to-establish-back-channel-to-kremlin/2018/03/07/b6a5fb8c-224b-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.cf5d268f2d0a&wpisrc=al_news__alert-politics--alert-national&wpmk=1) Prince's earlier statements that the meeting happened by chance and he was in the Seychelles in a business capacity only.
1.10.7.3.2.2. Pro: [Jared Kushner](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/us/politics/kushner-talked-to-russian-envoy-about-creating-secret-channel-with-kremlin.html) proposed a secret back channel line of communication at the Russian embassy. This would mean that the US couldn't follow the conversations, but Russia could.
1.10.7.3.2.3. Pro: Longtime Trump confidant and former Nixon administration official Roger Stone has [admitted](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/11/us/politics/roger-stone-trump-adviser-russia.html?ref=topics) to interacting with Russia-affiliated DNC hacker Guccifer 2.0 over direct message on Twitter.
1.10.7.3.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.3.
1.10.7.3.2.5. Pro: Paul Manafort, the campaign manager for Trump from May to August 2016, was [indicted](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/30/16571050/what-we-know-manafort-gates-papadopoulos) for money laundering, hiding tens of millions of dollars obtained for consulting work for the Party of Regions, a pro-Russia party in Ukraine whose candidate became president in 2010.
1.10.7.3.2.5.1. Pro: Rick Gates, an aid and business partner in Manafort's campaign, is also being [indicted](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/30/16571050/what-we-know-manafort-gates-papadopoulos) for allegedly helping Manafort launder millions of dollars and lying to the government about this activity.
1.10.7.3.2.5.1.1. Pro: Gates has since pleaded [guilty](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/rick-gates-to-plead-guilty-cooperate-with-mueller-in-russia-probe) to two charges in the Russia probe.
1.10.7.3.2.6. Pro: George Papadopoulos, a former Trump policy adviser, [admitted](https://www.vox.com/2017/12/1/16706534/michael-flynn-fbi-charged-deal) to lying to federal investigators about meetings in which he discussed potentially colluding with Russian agents to acquire Hilary Clinton's private emails.
1.10.7.3.2.7. Pro: Ahead of a controversial UNSC vote, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner [ordered](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/1/16724714/jared-kushner-flynn-russia) Flynn to contact Russia during the transition between administrations.
1.10.7.3.2.8. Pro: Attorney General Jeff Sessions has, repeatedly, "[forgotten](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/02/politics/jeff-sessions-russia/index.html)" about meetings with Russians in congressional testimony.
1.10.7.3.2.9. Pro: Former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn pleaded guilty to [lying to the FBI](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-michael-flynn-charged-20171201-story.html) about his contacts with Russians.
1.10.7.3.2.9.1. Pro: Flynn is also [cooperating](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/01/politics/michael-flynn-charged/index.html) with the Special Counsel's office investigation into the Trump campaign.
1.10.7.3.2.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.7.3.2.7.
1.10.7.3.2.10. Pro: [Michael Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Cohen_\(lawyer\)), a longtime Trump lawyer, met with Ukrainian opposition politicians to discuss a plan to lift sanctions against Russia. Cohen gave a proposal in a sealed envelope to then-National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn.
1.10.7.3.2.10.1. Pro: Andrii V. Artemenko, a Ukranian politician working with Michael Cohen, has stated publicly that top Russian officials have been [encouraging](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html) this plan.
1.10.7.3.2.11. Pro: [Carter Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Page), a former Foreign Policy advisor to the Trump campaign, has had numerous connections to the Russians and was approached by Russian Intelligence Operatives.
1.10.7.3.2.11.1. Pro: In 2013, Page [bragged](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/02/carter-page-reportedly-bragged-about-being-an-informal-adviser-to-the-kremlin-in-2013.html) about being an "informal Kremlin advisor."
1.10.7.3.2.11.2. Pro: While[Carter Page](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/03/carter-page-nunes-memo-216934) was a Trump Campaign official, he was invited to give a commencement address in Russia at a school funded by Putin and pro-Putin Russian oligarchs. He gave the speech and then met with Russian officials. Though initially denying these meetings, Page later admitted to them. His initial denials of these meetings indicate that he wanted to keep them from public view. There would be no reason to do that unless the purpose of the meetings was counter to the public's interest.
1.10.7.3.3. Pro: Pence said on an [interview](https://thinkprogress.org/timeline-trumpworld-russia-connection-denials-102adc089438/) with Fox News in January 2017, that there were no contacts between the campaign and the Russians. In retrospect, this is clearly a lie.
1.10.7.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.7.3.2.
1.10.7.3.4. Pro: Cambridge Analytica, which led the Trump campaign's data operations, [attempted](https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/27/politics/trump-campaign-wikileaks-cambridge-analytica/index.html) to obtain some of Hillary Clinton's leaked emails from the Russia-linked organization WikiLeaks.
1.10.7.3.5. Con: -> See 1.6.6.
1.10.7.3.6. Con: Campaigns and transitions frequently have contacts with representatives of foreign governments.
1.10.7.3.6.1. Con: Sometimes these contacts can turn out to be illegal, e.g. President Reagan's staff contacts with the Iranians during his [transition](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/15/world/new-reports-say-1980-reagan-campaign-tried-to-delay-hostage-release.html) and the eventual Iran-Contra scandal.
1.10.7.3.6.2. Con: When these contacts occur it is required by law that they be reported. Not reporting them, lying about them to the FBI or to the Senate under oath is illegal.
1.10.7.3.7. Pro: The Steele Dossier began the public proof that there were interactions between Trump officials and Russian agents.
1.10.7.3.7.1. Con: The primary document referenced to obtain a FISA warrant was the "Infamous Dossier". This has been discredited because the fact the [DNC paid](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/clinton-dnc-russia-dossier.html) for this dossier was not explicitly called out in the FISA request.
1.10.7.3.7.1.1. Con: Whether the grounds for the investigation are legal or not has no bearing on whether Trump colluded with Russia. While it could have implications about whether an investigation is legal, whether Trump colluded is an independent event.
1.10.7.3.7.1.2. Con: Steele worked as an MI6 spy for 20+ years, with over a decade spent in Moscow. He was called to investigate Litvinenko murder and for various other high profile investigations. It is unlikely that a [multi-decade seasoned professional](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier) would lie or misrepresent this situation to the FBI to the degree claimed by the opposition.
1.10.7.3.7.1.3. Con: [Exhibit A: 2016 FISA *Renewal*](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4614708/Carter-Page-FISA-Application.pdf) The dossier is clearly not the primary source for the renewal and more than half the page mentioning it is taken up with the "footnote" explaining its dubious origin.
1.10.7.3.7.1.4. Con: FISA warrant was requested 2013. Dossier was written 2016. The 2016 renewal references the dossier but clearly could not do so as a primary source. [2016 FISA RENEWAL](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4614708/Carter-Page-FISA-Application.pdf)
1.10.7.3.7.1.5. Con: FISA documents always avoid naming US entities. After the 3 line mention of the dossier connection in the 2016 *renewal*, more than half the physical page is taken up detailing that Campaign #2 can be considered a source for the material. This is simply how FISA applications are written and is indeed painstakingly following rather than breaking the law. [Declassified 2016 renewal](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4614708/Carter-Page-FISA-Application.pdf)
1.10.7.3.7.1.6. Con: The FISA warrant and dossier are irrelevant to whether or not Trump did or did not in fact collude with Russia. Either he did or he did not. FISA and dossier are irrelevant to the question.
1.10.7.3.7.1.7. Con: The president is NOT the only public figure with deep intelligence on the dosser. The Senate Intelligence Committee could know as much as he does. There are certainly members of the U.S. intelligence community with more information on the dossier than the president. Unless the president requests otherwise, he will only be briefed on a need to know basis. Any specific intel request from the president could reveal what he already knows or his motivation for making such a request.
1.10.7.3.7.1.8. Con: This president has a rich and robust history of making false and misleading statements. So suggesting that he should be believed now on something as damaging to him as the Steele dossier seems hopelessly naive.
1.10.7.3.7.1.9. Con: The Christopher Steele Dossier has not been discredited.  Parts of the Dossier have been proven true, and parts of the dossier have yet to be verified.  But it’s not the case that the claims in the Dossier have been proven false.
1.10.7.3.7.1.9.1. Pro: Checking with the dictionary, the oft-cited by Trump defenders of the dossier being "[not verified](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/verified?s=t)" is not the same as saying the dossier is "[not true](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/true?s=t)". And as indicated above parts of it have been verified as [accurate](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-russia-dossier-christopher-steele-fake-true-mi6-putin-moscow-hotel-cohen-a8315046.html), and some parts of it have not yet been verified. No parts of it have been found to be false. \(As far as what information is publicly available. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has likely verified or dis-confirmed the rest of it.\)
1.10.7.3.7.1.10. Con: The Christopher Steele Dossier was not part of the FISA warrant application on Carter Page.  The FISA application did have information the FBI obtained from Christopher Steele about Carter Page’s meetings in Russia, but not the Dossier itself.  And Christopher Steele’s information was not the sole basis for the FISA warrant, it was just one component out of many in a detailed FISA application.
1.10.7.3.7.1.10.1. Con: The original warrant application occurred in 2013, long before the dossier or any of the Trump related actions.
1.10.7.3.7.1.10.2. Pro: The document itself has been [declassified](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4614708/Carter-Page-FISA-Application.pdf).
1.10.7.3.7.1.11. Con: It’s true that the Democratic National Committee was not mentioned by name in the FISA warrant application, but that’s because almost all names are masked in FISA applications.  But the application did convey to the court the notion that this was part of political opposition research conducted by political opponents of Donald Trump.  See the quote from the application given on page 5 of the Schiff Memo: [democrats-intelligence.house.gov](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/redacted_minority_memo_2.24.18.pdf)
1.10.7.3.7.1.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.10.7.3.7.1.10.2.
1.10.7.3.7.1.12. Con: The Steele Dossier origins [began with oppo research](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/us/politics/steele-dossier-trump-expained.html) in the primaries paid for by Republican donors supporting Marco Rubio.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13. Pro: President Trump has said the dossier is fake many times, because our President is the only public figure with deep intelligence on the dossier to speak publicly on the subject, and since no one with access to the same detailed intelligence has disputed it as fervently, what he says must be seen as true until further information is revealed to the public.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.1. Con: Donald Trump is known to lie about anything and everything. There is no reason to trust his word without evidence.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.1.1. Con: Trump has a disincentive to lie on issues of national security because he swore an oath on the holy bible to "serve protect and defend the constitution" lying on this issue would violate that oath, because Trump is a Christian he must believe that this would cause him to burn in hell for eternity, which is far worse than any consequence he would get if it were actually true.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.1.1.1. Con: There is little meaningful evidence of Trump being religious.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.1.1.1.1. Con: How faithfully he practices the religion is not of concern, but whether he believes in it, he says he is Christian, there's no reason to doubt he believes in Hell, as every Christian does.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.1.1.2. Con: Many religious people have lied throughout history.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.1.1.2.1. Con: Religious people may lie, but not when sworn on the holy bible, because to do so would be instant condemnation to an eternity in hell.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Plenty of Religious people have been convicted of crimes, despite swearing their innocence on their holy books. A great majority of them were actually guilty too.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.2. Con: To describe Trump as someone with deep intel on the dossier is a misrepresentation. He has deep *access* to intel, however does not read daily briefings, or to any reading or research of his own other than watching Fox News. [usnews.com](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/thomas-jefferson-street/articles/2018-02-09/why-it-matters-that-trump-doesnt-read-his-daily-intelligence-briefings) [time.com](http://time.com/5115152/mike-pompeo-cia-intelligence-briefings/)
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.2.1. Con: This claim is a rumor based on unnamed sources, there is nothing substantial corroborating it.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.3. Con: What Donald Trump says frequently has little in common with truth or reality. According to the award winning Trump [lie tracker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-claims-database/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a79f5a02c9f2) of the Washington Post fact checker, in just 558 days Donald Trump has made 4,229 false or misleading claims.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.3.1. Con: The Washington Post is not a trustworthy source, it is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos who has an incentive to keep the president from regulating and policing Amazon by giving him a bad public image.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.3.1.1. Con: Just because it is not perceived as trustworthy, does not mean it is wrong.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.3.1.2. Con: Attacking the president would seem to make him *more* likely to do things that impact the attacker negatively.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.3.1.3. Con: Republican politicians have no evident desire to regulate big business in any meaningful way, making it unlikely that Jeff Bezos is concerned that a Republican politician would enact limitations on his business.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.3.1.4. Con: There is [no evidence](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/04/04/trump-amazon-washington-post-jeff-bezos-217774) of Jeff Bezos influencing the Washington Post's news or editorial content whatsoever.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.3.1.5. Con: It isn't clear how giving a person a bad public image would make them *less* likely to retaliate, or limit their ability to do so.
1.10.7.3.7.1.13.3.1.6. Con: Corruption occurs when favors are exchanged, not when an attack has occurred. For a media owner to earn favor with a politician, one would expect the media to report favorably on them as opposed to criticism, which would garner neutral or hostile reaction.
1.10.7.4. Pro: The only hard evidence of collusion exists between the DNC/Clinton campaign and the Russians by virtue of Sid Blumenthal and Jeffrey Winer's work with Christopher Steele.  Even the Washington Post [wrote about it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/02/13/the-media-is-ignoring-ties-between-the-clinton-campaign-and-russians/?utm_term=.7dde66f1dda1).
1.10.7.5. Con: Clinton is a private citizen, and not the sitting president of the United States. Whatever vague accusations Clinton's political opponents continue to throw at her have little weight comparatively.
1.10.7.5.1. Con: One's position in society has no bearing on one's guilt or innocence.
1.10.7.5.1.1. Con: Position does not affect innocence or guilt. It does affect the importance of determining innocence or guilt.
1.10.7.5.2. Con: Clinton may be a private citizen now, but she has [served](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hillary-Rodham-Clinton) as Secretary of State, a US Senator and FLOTUS.
1.10.7.6. Con: The allegations that Clinton somehow colluded with Russia are a baseless [conspiracy theory](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2017/10/27/claims-of-clinton-russia-uranium-scandal-are-a-real-empty-barrel/#32124fcb7b55).
1.10.8. Con: There is no evidence that Democrats have deliberately released false statements regarding the investigation, and the evidence-backed true statements that have been released were done so in good faith, for the good of the American people.
1.10.9. Con: Prior to the 2016 presidential election, the FBI consisted largely of pro-Trump agents and employees. [\(Source\)](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump)

1.12. Pro: -> See 1.10.7.3.
1.13. Con: -> See 1.3.7.2.2.3.1.1.
1.14. Pro: Financial connections between Trump & Russia go back decades. This is about money laundered as real-estate & casino investments through companies like Prevezon that Trump owes money on & the reason why he refuses to release his tax returns. The Trumps have publicly spoken about the money they have received from Russia for years. There is no question about him colluding with Russia. He only started denying it when he entered politics.
1.14.1. Con: The existence of a financial debt does not mean a crime has been committed or that there is any obligation other than repayment of the loan.
1.14.1.1. Con: The only reason to lie is to hide the truth.  If there was no reason for concern with the financial debt that Trump has incurred to the Russians, then he would not be throwing a huge smokescreen of lies to cover it.
1.14.2. Pro: Several months after Trump took office, the [Prevezon case was dismissed](https://www.vox.com/2017/7/18/15983910/donald-trump-russia-putin-fbi-collusion-fusion-gps) \(May 2017\). \(Prevezon is a holding company with links to Russian elites that has been accused of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars through New York City real estate.\)
1.14.2.1. Con: [The case was settled](http://nordic.businessinsider.com/us-v-prevezon-case-settlement-russia-money-laundering-2017-5/) for three times \($6M\) the amount that the Government alleged was laundered by Prevezon \($1.9M\).
1.14.2.2. Pro: Congressional [Democrats suspect](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/house-dems-demand-info-doj-settlement-russian-lawyer-article-1.3321728) that Attorney General Jeff Sessions pressured Joon H. Kim, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, to settle the case at a loss for the United States in order to obscure the underlying facts.
1.14.2.2.1. Con: Joon H. Kim is a [longtime friend](https://heavy.com/news/2017/03/joon-h-kim-preet-bharara-replacement-donald-trump-age-us-attorney-manhattan-who-bio-family/) of and was an adviser to his predecessor, Preet Bharara \(the previous Attorney General who was set to prosecute the Prevezon case before he was removed by President Trump\). Kim has not made any claim in the public record that he was pressured by Jeff Sessions.
1.14.3. Con: The situations mentioned do provide credible motives for colluding with Russia, but they alone are insufficient for proving it. Having a motive != did it
1.15. Con: -> See 1.10.7.3.7.1.
