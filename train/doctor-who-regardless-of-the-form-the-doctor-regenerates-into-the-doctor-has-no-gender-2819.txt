Discussion Title: Doctor Who: Regardless of the form the Doctor regenerates into, the Doctor has no gender.

1. Regardless of the form the Doctor regenerates into, the Doctor has no gender.
1.1. Pro: The Doctor is non-binary/genderfluid.
1.2. Con: Doctor Who was always male. This standardized the role for the audience which by watching defines the characters of the show.
1.3. Con: The Doctor regenerates as a man or a woman, hence the Doctor has a gender \(even if it changes\).
1.4. Con: Gender is a human concept; Time Lords may not have such a concept.
1.4.1. Pro: Time Lords had moved beyond the notion of [gender](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Gender) by the time the Doctor was a child.
1.4.2. Con: Many species have binary gender. Depending on the point in their evolution they might also "outgrow" it.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Jack Harkness mentions once that he had gotten pregnant before, alluding that by the 51st century humans' gender is fluid as well.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Lady Cassandra mentions growing up "a young boy" on Earth at the end of the Earth; this suggests she is a trans character.
1.4.3. Pro: -> See discussion #1570: Gender \(the [concept](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/gendermed/sexandgender.html) of masculinity and femininity\) is a social construct.
1.5. Pro: Other Time Lords are nonbinary \(like the Doctor\).
1.5.1. Pro: The Master/ Missy appears in either gender at different times.
1.5.2. Pro: Time Lords aren't male or female, they are beings.
1.5.3. Pro: The General regenerates from a white man into a woman of color.
1.5.4. Con: Time Lords and Time Ladies are male or female respectively; as dictated by the body they regenerate into.
1.5.4.1. Con: As modern feminist theory distinguishes between sex and gender it can be argued that while their sex might be dictated by the bodies they regenerate into, their gender is independent of that.
1.5.5. Pro: The Corsair took on different sexes throughout many regenerations.
1.5.5.1. Pro: The Corsair was the first Time Lord confirmed to change genders.
1.6. Pro: Time Lords do not procreate naturally.
1.6.1. Con: This is due to a curse, not biological development. In their original state, Time Lords were fertile.
1.6.2. Pro: Breeding machines called "[Looms](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Loom)" were used by the Great Houses of the Time Lords.
1.6.2.1. Con: The concept of Looms appeared in a New Adventures novel. As whether anything outside of the TV series \(such as the New Adventures novels, but extending to many other things to\), is canonical, that has never been expressly stated by the BBC one way or the other, so we cannot assume looms are actually real in the Doctor Who universe.
