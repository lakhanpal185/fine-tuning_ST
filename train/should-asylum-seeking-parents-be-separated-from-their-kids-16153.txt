Discussion Title: Should Asylum-Seeking Parents Be Separated From Their Kids?

1. Asylum-seeking parents should not be separated from their children
1.1. Pro: It is immoral to separate children from their parents.
1.1.1. Con: It is not necessarily immoral; sometimes such actions are unavoidable.
1.1.1.1. Con: Sometimes. But not in the cases we are talking about, namely asylum seekers at the border.
1.2. Con: In cases where human traffickers are posing as immigrants, it's safer to separate the children.
1.2.1. Con: But those aren't the cases relevant to the question. Human traffickers aren't parents, and their victims are not their children. The claim misses the point.
1.2.1.1. Con: While technically true, the point is that - when identifying individuals, and their relationships, is challenging - it can be safer for children to be separated until such a time as said relationships can be verified.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: Many of the separated families do have documentation. This policy is not about protecting children, it is about deterrence.
1.2.2. Pro: While such cases may be a minority, it is vital to ensure that any children who are accompanied by adults posing as their parents are separated, to ensure their safety.
1.2.3. Con: It's dangerous to use the behaviour of bad actors \(human traffickers\) to justify the mistreatment of innocent people \(asylum seekers\) - we should be smart enough to detect the difference without resorting to warehouses and cages.
1.3. Con: Many migrants are economic migrants and not asylum-seekers.
1.3.1. Con: That is not a reason to subject them to an inhumane practice of separating small children from their parents.
1.3.2. Pro: Asylum seekers need genuine help, while economic migrants are seeking financial gain; it is important not to confuse the two.
1.3.3. Con: Each persons claim should be evaluated using due process to determine if their asylum claim is legitimate.
1.3.4. Con: There is not a firm line separating two classes of immigrants. Most people seek economic opportunities, even as they move away from oppressive situations. If their homeland has been exploited by the USA, both conditions are likely.
1.3.5. Con: The migrants status doesn't materially reduce trauma to the child being separated from his or her parent.
1.4. Con: Children can't legally be detained together with parents who cross the border in an illegal way.
1.4.1. Pro: Children can only be kept in the same detention centers as their parents for 20 days. [vox.com](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/20/17484546/executive-order-family-separation-flores-settlement-agreement-immigration)
1.4.2. Con: Seeking asylum is legal.
1.4.3. Con: Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor, not a crime. So the solution in cases of illegal entry is to not lock up the mothers either. [www.law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1325)
1.5. Pro: As long as the parents are following the law, the family should not be separated.
1.5.1. Pro: Parents are at risk of being deported without their kids and never seeing their kids again.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Children are being used as pawns for a political purpose and the trauma caused to parents and their children is irreparable.
1.5.2. Con: If you crossed the border illegally you broke the law.
1.6. Pro: Parents are pressured to plead guilty and give up asylum in order to get their kids back.
1.6.1. Pro: This is a link to an article in the Business Insider that supports the claim. “A new report suggests federal officials are pressuring parents to give up their asylum claims and accept voluntary deportation to see their kids faster.”[businessinsider.com](http://www.businessinsider.com/zero-tolerance-parents-pressured-into-deportation-in-exchange-for-seeing-kids-2018-6)
1.7. Pro: It is hugely damaging to the children involved.
1.7.1. Pro: The detention centers are not equipped to handle these kids, and the kids are being kept in cages and former big box stores.
1.7.1.1. Pro: This is a fundamental breach of basic human rights.
1.7.1.2. Con: There is suggestion that the conditions have been grossly [misrepresented](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/18/us/photo-migrant-child-cage-trnd/index.html).
1.7.2. Pro: There have been reports of children being drugged without their or their parent's consent. [www.revealnews.org](https://www.revealnews.org/blog/immigrant-children-forcibly-injected-with-drugs-lawsuit-claims/)
1.7.3. Pro: Kids who are separated from their parents experience [toxic stress](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/how-the-toxic-stress-of-family-separation-can-harm-a-child).
1.7.4. Pro: Children will later have problems finding their parents and will tend to have psychological problems later in life   [bmjopen.bmj.com](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e015157) [www.cambridge.org](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/trauma-and-resilience-in-young-refugees-a-9year-followup-study/5EB928F5698720F9B884F26E065EA0FE) [search.proquest.com](https://search.proquest.com/openview/edd6d7e61bff5a7adc8c173e60f7d20a/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=40853)
1.8. Con: The practice keeps people from wanting to come to the US.
1.8.1. Con: This is not a good thing. Asylum seekers actually do need help.
1.8.2. Con: The US needs immigrants, especially unskilled ones.
1.8.3. Con: People have the right to ask for asylum.
1.8.4. Con: This policy only works as a deterrent if it's worse than what they left. People are still coming, which shows how bad it was. For us to add more cruelty to their lives - especially to children - is immoral and unAmerican.
1.9. Pro: This is similar to other practices that are considered human rights abuses, like Japanese internment camps and concentration camps.
