Discussion Title: Should Couples Sign A Prenuptial Agreement Before Marriage?

1. All couples should sign a prenuptial agreement before marriage.
1.1. Con: A person who contributes to the continuing success and growth of their spouse's business or professional practice may not be entitled to claim a share of the increase in value if they're pushed to agree otherwise in a premarital agreement.
1.1.1. Pro: For people who spend the marriage doing unpaid labour, such as one spouse acting as a stay-at-home parent, they are put in a very disadvantageous position after the divorce as they didn't have the opportunity to save money themselves.
1.1.1.1. Pro: With women making up [90% of parents](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/9822271/Rise-in-stay-at-home-fathers-fuelled-by-growing-numbers-of-female-breadwinners.html) who mind the children while their partner works, this would put many women in a financially difficult position should they get divorced.
1.1.1.2. Pro: It is difficult for these people to re-enter the workforce after the divorce due to large gaps in their CV from time spent at home, and lack of transferrable skills sought after by employers.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Leaving abusive and unhealthy marriages becomes more difficult for these people when they're unlikely to support themselves and their family without depending on the "breadwinner" of the household.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Abusive partners are often abusive throughout the relationship and before the marriage; as such, those couples' prenuptial agreements are written under the paradigm of that power imbalance, and the abused partner might be worse off under the agreement in the event of a divorce.
1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Alimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimony) payments are required without prenuptial agreements in many countries. Some prenuptial agreements even waive the right to alimony in the event of divorce, leaving the less well off spouse at even more of a disadvantage than they would have been without the agreement.
1.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.1.2. Con: Prenups are a negotiation. Both parties enter into it, meaning that if one spouse is the breadwinner, they may actually have more equitable terms built in. Only a prenup badly worded would prevent someone from claiming a share of value.
1.1.3. Pro: Prenuptial agreements circumvent divorce law, which is designed to ensure an equitable distribution of assets.
1.1.3.1. Con: There is no one universally-applicable standard of 'fairness'. It is better for the parties to a marriage to decide what is fair, rather than for courts to impose their own standards.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: It is very hard for courts to determine how much someone has 'contributed' to a marriage as it is an intangible concept.
1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: It is not only hard for courts to determine that, but it may present a serious point of disagreement for the divorcing couple as well. They may perceive their relative contribution very different from each other.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Courts struggle to deal with [short marriages](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/family/case-could-change-everything-couples-divorcing-short-marriage/) in which one party contributed the vast majority of the financial gain because it is not clear what is fair in that circumstance.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Many legal systems around the world adopt the 'sharing principle'. This states that in general assets should be shared equally between the parties. Prenuptial agreements therefore unduly favour the wealthier party.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: In England and Wales, [White v White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_v_White) established that assets should generally be shared unless there was a good reason to depart from this principle. This was to ensure it was recognised both parties usually contribute equally to the success of a marriage.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Both parties often contribute in different ways to the success of their marriage, even if they contribute the same time and effort \(such as one party being the breadwinner and the other being a house-spouse\). Equal splitting of assets fails to acknowledge these differences in financial contribution.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The conditions under which two spouses cooperate, for example, one being the breadwinner and the other a house spouse, are normally mutually agreed upon by the couple. If the breadwinner is happy to provide for the two of them during the marriage, because of the contribution the other partner makes in being a house spouse, then there is no reason to make the distinction between financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: If both parties to a marriage agree to conduct their divorce on the basis of different principles to those outlined in the law, they should be empowered to do so.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The individuals who are party to a relationship are in a better position than the state to outline the terms that would be acceptable to them in the event of the end of a relationship.
1.1.4. Con: If a prenuptial agreement is seriously unfair, many jurisdictions will set it aside on the grounds of unconscionability.
1.1.4.1. Pro: In England and Wales, prenuptial agreements are [not automatically legally binding](https://www.kingsleynapley.co.uk/insights/blogs/family-law-blog/present-and-future-laws-on-prenuptial-agreements-will-they-or-wont-they-stand-up-in-court) and can be dismissed by the court.
1.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.
1.1.4.3. Con: Many jurisdictions will not, including Montana in which a prenup made between a 62-year-old sophisticated businessman and his 21 year-old bride, who was developmentally handicapped and very unsophisticated and had no legal representation [was enforced](https://www.wagnersidlofsky.com/setting-aside-unconscionable-prenuptial-agreements/).
1.1.4.4. Pro: [Canadian law](http://www.separation.ca/family-law/prenuptial-agreement) allows prenups to be set aside if either party did not disclose information to the other side, or if one party did not understand the implications of what they were signing.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: If all parties must be fully forthcoming about their financial status then their spouse cannot later be blindsided by debts they were not made aware of in advance.
1.1.4.5. Con: The person to whom the prenuptial agreement is unfair is likely to be the poorer party. As such, they are less likely to be able to access the same quality of legal resources to get the prenup set aside as their spouse is to defend it.
1.1.4.5.1. Con: The fact that women are more likely to achieve [child custody](https://www.divorcenet.com/resources/divorce/for-men/divorce-for-men-why-women-get-child-custody-over-80-time) than men in traditional divorce proceedings even though women tend to have less [wealth](https://books.google.ie/books?id=Z49oAgAAQBAJ&dq=wealth+gap+in+marriages+men+and+women) than men indicates that family law courts cannot be bought by those with more money to spend on lawyers.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Con: This argument does not take into account whether men want to achieve child custody more than women in the first place.
1.1.4.5.1.2. Con: [91% of child custody agreements](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/cathy-meyer/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115.html) are decided outside of court. The gender disparity has very little to do with the court system, and much more to do with gender norms and roles.
1.1.4.5.1.2.1. Con: The court system is the mechanism by which disputes in divorces are resolved. The claims above argue that they cannot be trusted because of the influence of gender norms and roles on them. Given that mothers tend to win child custody cases when they are contested, this would indicate that gender norms and roles do not have the effect which is claimed.
1.1.4.5.1.3. Con: This is based on \(old-fashioned\) assumptions that the mother is better than the father at raising their children: this does not change the fact that the court is biased towards the stronger party with better lawyers when it comes to splitting assets.
1.1.4.5.1.3.1. Pro: Child custody arrangements typically [cannot](http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/what-can-and-cannot-be-included-in-prenuptial-agreements.html) be agreed to in a prenup.
1.1.4.5.2. Con: Family law judges exercise a great deal of [control](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/09/the-sinister-power-of-britains-family-courts/) over their courtrooms. The expertise of legal representatives is less likely to play a large role in the eventual verdict in such instances.
1.1.4.5.2.1. Pro: Family law courts usually [lack juries](http://tella.catalogue.tcd.ie/iii/encore/myaccount). This means that judges make the final call. Trained judges are less likely to be swayed by weak arguments made by unscrupulous lawyers.
1.1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: The role of a judge is to be an [impartial decision maker](http://www.cscja-acjcs.ca/role_of_judge-en.asp?l=5) in legal proceedings. As this is their profession, they are more likely to unbiased than a random sample of citizens who are called in to fill their civic duty as a jury member.
1.1.4.5.2.1.2. Pro: Judges have to provide a [judicial opinion](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f9cc/6a5600ae29cc0671cd5bcd78001aebc085bd.pdf), justifying the decisions to which they come. This means that their reasoning has to be sound and based on evidence presented in trials.
1.1.4.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: This puts judges in a position of higher accountability than juries, who come to a decision in a closed hearing and deliver it without a burden to justify said decision.
1.1.4.5.3. Con: [Legal aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aid) systems are present in many countries. These ensure that those who cannot afford private legal representation have a legal representative. This mitigates the legal inequality between partners in a divorce.
1.1.4.5.3.1. Con: Private lawyers are in a [better position](https://www.legalserviceslink.com/blog/private-attorney-vs-public-defender-choosing-the-right-defense-attorney) to win these cases due to the financial incentive legal aid lawyers do not have, their lesser loads of work, and access to resources unavailable to public lawyers.
1.1.4.5.4. Pro: As divorce law exists to protect the weaker party, prenuptial agreements usually involve waiving those protections \([Brod, p.238](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/01b9/5be3b6412072539ddf0dbbbe5b6d90cd92ed.pdf)\).
1.1.5. Con: A lack of certainty is a large deterrence for the financially weaker party in terms of initiating a divorce. The certainty of a prenup allows them to accurately assess their options.
1.1.5.1. Con: The certainty of a prenup can also act as a deterrence for the weaker party, as they're more likely to end up with less than without a prenup in case of a divorce.
1.1.6. Pro: The spouse who is likely to earn more money/has greater assets is [usually the one](https://www.moonbeever.com/our-thinking/blogs/family-law-items/1109-gender-issues-in-prenuptial-agreements) who wants a pre-nuptial agreement to ensure they keep the vast majority of assets following the divorce.
1.2. Pro: In addition to helping with planning in the case of a divorce, a prenup can help couples plan in the case of a spouse's death.
1.2.1. Con: This planning can be done in a person's [will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_and_testament); it does not have to be done in a prenup.
1.2.1.1. Con: In many states, prenups hold [more legal power](http://info.legalzoom.com/prenuptial-agreement-priority-over-last-testament-4741.html) than wills and are more effective tools for planning due to this.
1.2.1.2. Con: A will can easily be re-written. The terms of a prenup, agreed to when a couple married, are far more difficult to challenge and are therefore a more stable foundation to plan around.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The terms of a will are up to the individual who leaves the will, while rewriting a prenup involves complete agreement of the two parties involved and therefore is harder to challenge.
1.2.1.3. Con: Unlike wills, which only govern the share of property that is owned by the deceased, a prenup can allow more holistic planning for the entire estate of the couple.
1.2.2. Con: Prenups are often used to disinherit less well-off spouses in [second and later life marriages](https://www.ohioprobatelawyer.com/inheritance/2017/03/14/prenup-prevent-inheriting-spouse/), which may leave them financially struggling in the wake if their spouse's death.
1.2.2.1. Con: Individuals who want a second or later life marriage should be able to enter into them without worrying that they could be disinheriting existing children or previous spouses. Prenups allow them to avoid that scenario with explicit acknowledgement of each spouse's entitlements when they get married.
1.2.2.2. Con: Spouses have no right to the wealth of their partner after their death, especially if that was against their partner's wishes.
1.3. Pro: As marriage loses ground in the modern world, with on-demand divorce, prenuptial agreements restore the ideals of real sacrifice, consequence, and promise.
1.3.1. Pro: The earliest recorded marriages \(Babylonian law, and the record of marriages in Genesis\) relied on a contract.
1.3.2. Con: Couples who choose to have prenups mostly do so to make the divorce process [easier](https://www.lawyers.com/legal-info/family-law/divorce/how-a-prenuptial-agreement-changes-the-divorce-process.html), not as a sacrifice.
1.3.2.1. Con: It is legitimate for couples to marry without believing or wanting that marriage to last until one of them dies. Prenups allow couples to end that marriage on terms acceptable to both spouses.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: Marriage loses its core purpose of attempting to unify two individuals for life if people enter into a marriage without believing or wanting that marriage to last until one of them dies.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The stated core purpose is a subjective view. Some people may see the core purpose of marriage differently, e.g. as a legal status that makes shared ownership of assets, cohabitation and having kids easier in a modern state.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The purpose of marriage being a union for life is more than just a subjective view - it is often supported by tradition and/or religious doctrine.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Marriage does not belong to one tradition or religion. Different people ought to be allowed to define what marriage means to them without being bound by previous practice.
1.3.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: With a larger portion of the world turning to [atheism](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/), there are logically fewer people tied to these religious views of the value of marriage.
1.3.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: In the US, there have been found to be [many different](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/02/13/love-and-marriage/) motivations for marriage, with no consensus on a single core purpose.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Signing a prenup doesn't mean the a couple doesn't believe or want their marriage to last. Each partner may want their marriage to last but not know exactly what their partner thinks or how circumstances may change in the future. Given that, prenups present a way to offset risk but don't undermine the core purpose of marriage.
1.3.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: People take out fire insurance on buildings without wanting or believing that they will burn down. Rather, they recognise that risk associated with negative outcomes can be large and take sensible steps to offset them. Prenups are no different.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Couples can perceive emotions - even such strong ones as love - as subject to change over time, and can rationally accept that their desire to be together may change in the future due to a variety of circumstances. Having a firm belief in people not changing with respect to each other over the course of a lifetime is irrational.
1.3.2.1.3. Pro: People may want to be married while they raise children, but believe that once they are grown-up being married is no longer necessary.
1.3.3. Con: Prenuptial agreements usually help reduce individual sacrifice by putting limits on the losses of the higher net-worth partner in contrast to an equal split of combined assets upon divorce.
1.3.4. Con: Prenuptial agreements have been part of long-standing marriage traditions across a number of different cultures. In these cultures, prenups don't bring anything new to a marriage and can't counterbalance marriage losing ground.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The Jewish [ketubah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketubah) is an integral part of the Jewish marriage.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: The ketubah is only a one-way contract that details what is [expected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketubah#Content) of a husband towards his wife under Halakha \(the Jewish Law\) - clothing, food and sex.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: The traditional formulations of ketubot do not include a provision for the wife to be able to obtain a divorce without an [explicit agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_prenuptial_agreement#Halakhic_background) from the husband \(a "get"\).
1.3.4.1.2.1. Con: In modern times, this is prevented by the addition of the [Lieberman clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieberman_clause) to the ketubah, requiring the adjudication of the divorce by a [beth din](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_din) \(rabbinical court\).
1.3.4.2. Pro: In [Islamic tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_marriage_contract), the couple to be married sign an aqd zawaj \(a marriage contract\), which can include a variety of clauses about the rights and responsibilities of both parties towards each other, often \(but not always\) regulating the conditions for divorce as well.
1.3.5. Pro: The traditional conception of marriage as a life-long commitment for people who did not expect a great deal of change in their life is no longer fit for purpose. Prenups allow couples to construct a conception of marriage that is appropriate to their lives and preferences, through mutual consent.
1.3.6. Pro: 87% of the world lives in countries with marriage rates that have [fallen](http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WMD2008/WP_WMD_2008/Data.html) since the 1980s. This illustrates that a new approach to marriage is needed.
1.3.6.1. Con: Change in social and cultural values is likely a reason why marriage rates have been falling. It's highly unlikely that prenups will have a significant impact upon this.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: More people now view marriage as a choice rather than a required part of their life.
1.3.6.1.2. Pro: Unmarried couples living together and having children out of wedlock is no longer as frowned upon as it was historically.
1.3.6.2. Con: Falling marriage rates are not necessarily a bad thing.
1.3.7. Con: Typically, one spouse is more interested in a prenup than another and [initiates](http://Often the initiating party \(or their lawyer\) says, “You can just put the premarital agreement in a drawer and forget about it.” That is not true. The premarital agreement cannot be forgotten and is presumptively legally binding as soon as it is pulled out of the drawer.) its negotiation. Their partner is merely compliant. This may erode trust and create division in the relationship as it moves forwards.
1.3.7.1. Pro: This means that a prenup can further entrench power relations between partners, giving one a bigger social advantage in the relationship.
1.3.7.2. Pro: Prenup negotiations are typically overseen by lawyers who use what seems like harsh, business like language to describe what would happen in the instance of the breakdown of a romantic relationship. This can be a trying process for new relationships.
1.3.7.2.1. Con: Couples would be less likely to rush into marriage if they are aware of the trying process of prenup negotiations, which would in turn lead to less divorces caused by incompatibility.
1.3.8. Pro: Marriage should be treated like a business partnership with no less planning to include counseling. The long-term risks only vary by kind and not degree of impact on the relationship. Money, time, and peace of mind can be preserved with an agreement put in place before marriage.
1.4. Pro: Prenuptial agreement is the fairest way of dividing property in cases of divorce.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.7.
1.4.2. Pro: In some cases of divorce, one spouse might decide to just give in to all of the other spouse's demands instead of suffering through a lengthy court process. Prenups can prevent these situations from arising.
1.4.2.1. Con: A lengthy trial is not the only option; there are alternative methods for dispute resolution which are cheaper, faster and potentially less stressful for the two parties.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: [Mediation](https://www.goldbergjones-sandiego.com/divorce/mediation-vs-arbitration/) is a process in which the two sides work together with a third-party facilitator, to reach an agreement. In this interactive process, the moderator guides the two sides through conflict and disagreement towards a mutually beneficial settlement.
1.4.2.1.2. Pro: [Arbitration](https://www.goldbergjones-sandiego.com/divorce/mediation-vs-arbitration/) is a process in which an outside third party meets with both sides. Instead of facilitating the process, in arbitration, the moderator passes judgment. Each spouse presents their case and the objective outsider renders decisions on the issues that are subject to disagreement.
1.4.2.1.3. Con: After suffering the pain of the breakup of a marriage, even easier methods of negotiation may feel too dragged out and difficult for some individuals.
1.4.3. Pro: Prenuptial agreements allow couples to split property according to their own preferences.
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.
1.4.3.2. Pro: Prenuptial agreements allow one of the spouses to ensure they retain a family home they have inherited.
1.4.3.3. Con: The division of property during the process of drafting a prenup can become tilted in favor of the individual with the best attorney.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.1.
1.4.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.2.
1.4.3.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.3.
1.4.3.3.4. Pro: In the "honeymoon" stage of a relationship, one spouse may agree to terms which are detrimental to their own interests because they feel too in love with their spouse to contradict their interests or to imagine an eventual divorce.
1.4.3.3.4.1. Pro: '[Optimism bias](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211011912)' ensures that people think they are very unlikely to get divorced, even if that is statistically unfounded.
1.4.3.3.4.1.1. Pro: Many of the Western World countries have divorce-to-marriage ratios [in excess of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_demography#Divorce_to_marriage_ratio) 40-50%.
1.4.3.3.5. Con: The person with the best lawyer wins best terms of prenup agreement for the same reason that the person with the best lawyer in small claims courts wins. The best lawyer argument is not restricted to prenup. However using this as argument against having prenup carries the implication that law systems are inherently flawed. While law systems are inherently flawed, it is the best solution available for settling arguments.
1.4.3.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.5.
1.4.3.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.5. Pro: If all couples signed prenups the civil law system would become more efficient.
1.5.1. Con: The welfare of each individual who enters into a marriage contract is a more important consideration than the efficiency of the civil law system.
1.5.1.1. Con: The welfare of the individuals is better facilitated when they no longer need to wait for months for their case to be heard in the civil court system.
1.5.2. Con: Congestion in family law courts can be combated through other reforms. For instance, reforms as simple as providing parties with better information at an earlier [stage](http://www.lawtimesnews.com/author/na/family-law-reforms-aim-to-cut-down-on-court-congestion-8057/) can reduce congestion by making parties less likely to pursue unproductive litigation in court.
1.5.3. Pro: Congestion in civil courts is a [concerning issue](http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1960111600). Those seeking just outcomes are forced to wait for excessive periods of time and in that period may face significant financial and emotional difficulty.
1.5.4. Pro: A typical divorce settlement can take [over a year](https://psychcentral.com/lib/reduce-the-stress-of-a-divorce/) to finalise, whereas prenuptial agreements streamline the process, reducing the period of uncertainty.
1.5.5. Con: The status of prenuptial agreements is [unclear](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/divorce/8068458/Heiress-Katrin-Radmacher-and-the-100m-prenuptial-disagreement.html) in many jurisdictions, which can lead to even more complex and costly court proceedings.
1.5.5.1. Con: While there may be uncertainty about prenuptial agreements drawn up and brought to court in different countries or jurisdictions, there is usually less uncertainty about cases that happen within the same country.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Common law jurisdictions, such as state law within the US, often have unclear case law surrounding the enforceability of prenuptial agreements within the same state because of their relatively recent development \([Biemiller, p.133](http://file:///Users/JJackson/Downloads/Biemiller%20Galleys041114%20\(1\).pdf)\).
1.6. Pro: Prenups make sure that marriages become less about what an individual owns and more about being together with the one they love.
1.6.1. Con: Love is an emotion that, like any emotion, can either grow or fade. Something as uncertain as this should not be the main foundation of something as life-changing as marriage.
1.6.1.1. Con: 88% of the respondents in an [online poll in 2013](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/02/13/8-facts-about-love-and-marriage/) listed love as a "very important reason" for getting married.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: This poll was conducted in the United States where the concept of romantic love is popularised throughout society through media. In many cultures, romantic love is not considered to be an important factor in deciding who to marry.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: Stephanie Coontz in [Marriage, a History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/270008.Marriage_a_History) argues that "only rarely in history has love been seen as the main reason for getting married".
1.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: In ancient China, the word for love connoted a very socially [disrespectable](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-02-12/does-west-have-monopoly-romantic-love) relationship.
1.6.1.1.1.3. Pro: Historically, falling in love before marriage in India was considered an actively [antisocial act](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-02-12/does-west-have-monopoly-romantic-love).
1.6.1.2. Con: People marry for social status, the approval of their family and of society at large. Love will almost never be the sole motivation for marriage.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.2.
1.6.3. Con: Trust often makes up a big part of the foundation of a marriage.
1.6.4. Con: Individuals in marital relationships benefit from the financial resources of their partner during the period that they are married. Therefore, prenuptial agreements do not entirely remove the incentive to marry for money.
1.6.4.1. Con: A couple doesn't need to be married for one of them to benefit from the financial resources of the other.
1.6.5. Con: Prenups require explicit acknowledgement, discussion and negotiation over property when couples enter into marriage. This focus on property is far less present without a prenup. Therefore, prenups make the process of marriage itself far more concerned with what each individual owns, not less.
1.6.5.1. Con: On the event of the breakdown of the marriage, the entire focus will become about the property each spouse owns. It is important to have explicit discussion about these issues so that this is not the first time such problems arise.
1.6.6. Pro: Prenups make it less feasible for a person to marry someone with the intention of divorcing them at a later point in order to take control of a proportion of their financial assets.
1.6.6.1. Pro: It is better if prenups deter marriages which are based on such motivations from happening at all. This avoids the deception, emotional anguish and unfair distribution of resources associated with their eventual divorces.
1.6.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.
1.7. Con: Signing a prenuptial agreement is showing a lack of faith in the sustainability of the future marriage.
1.7.1. Pro: Couples may be less likely to work on problems that come up within the marriage if they know that they have the fallback of a convenient arrangement for them in the event of a divorce.
1.7.1.1. Con: Marriages often fail even when couples work to improve their problems; it is better to have a back up plan for such instances than none in place.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Putting effort into one's marriage and into resolving any problems that may arise is still more likely to successfully create and sustain a healthy marriage than not trying to work on a marriage would.
1.7.1.2. Con: Couples would still have fallout in the event of a divorce, in the form of emotional fallout, finding alternative accommodation, and dealing with the social stigma of divorce. Couples still have the incentive to work through their problems to avoid divorce.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: Couples with children have the added incentive to work through their problems for the sake of their children.
1.7.2. Pro: Even if neither spouse intends to undermine the other's faith in the marriage, talking about the marriage in purely commercial terms can undermine the other's confidence in their spouse's motives.
1.7.2.1. Con: Even if neither spouse intends to undermine the other's faith, getting a prenup can still engender the feeling that there is a lack of faith between the partners as a result of existing societal norms.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: These social norms can change as prenups become more common and facilitating serious conversation before marriage becomes normalised.
1.7.3. Con: The ability to have realistic conversations with your potential spouse about difficult relationship scenarios actually demonstrates a greater trust in the other person.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Talking about [money](https://www.npr.org/2016/03/08/469239033/how-to-keep-money-from-messing-up-your-marriage) before getting married means the issue is less likely to destabilise the marriage later on.
1.7.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.
1.8. Con: Part of the purpose of marriage is to share each other's life. Signing a prenup goes against this purpose.
1.8.1. Con: Marriage can also be seen as security in the long-term. Prenups remove a degree of future uncertainty, and thereby help provide that security.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.
1.8.3. Pro: For a couple with no significant disparity in individual wealth at the point of marriage, the lack of a prenuptial agreement demonstrates commitment to building their household and growing their wealth together equally, regardless of which of them contributes by working and which of them by staying at home with kids.
1.8.4. Pro: Couples may feel less able to emotionally commit to each other if they are aware of the exact details of what would occur if their marriage ended.
1.8.5. Con: Having to sign a prenup could deter couples who may not fully understand the gravity of the commitment of marriage from getting married in the first place, saving them from the emotional harms of divorce further down the line.
1.8.6. Con: If one of the couple is worried the other is entering the marriage for financial reasons, then a prenuptial agreement can help make them feel more secure.
1.8.7. Pro: The negotiation of a prenuptial agreement between couples with disparity in their individual wealth may make the poorer party acutely and uncomfortably aware of how relatively little they are contributing to the marriage monetarily.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.4.3.3.
1.10. Pro: Prenuptial agreements can protect individuals from potential harms in case of a divorce.
1.10.1. Pro: For a person who gives up a lucrative career for the sake of marriage, a premarital agreement can ensure that they will be compensated for that sacrifice if the marriage does not last.
1.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.10.2. Pro: Divorce laws very substantially from country to country, [in some cases](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/sep/19/expat-finance-divorce) leaving individuals without sufficient protection from potential harms.
1.10.3. Con: Prenuptial agreements are not legally binding in all countries.
1.10.3.1. Con: In countries where they are legally binding, prenups still offer significant protection that could not be accessed otherwise.
1.10.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.10.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.10.5. Pro: Divorce is an [extremely stressful](https://www.cdsoc.com/why-divorce-so-stressful-orange-county/) process, added to by the uncertainty of the settlement in court. Prenuptial agreements provide certainty, reducing this stress.
1.10.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.
1.10.6. Pro: A premarital agreement can protect the inheritance rights of children and grandchildren from a previous marriage.
1.11. Con: Prenuptial agreements are more likely to be disadvantageous to women in opposite-sex marriages, which harms gender equality overall.
1.11.1. Con: Favourable divorce outcomes for women are unlikely to significantly affect gender inequality.
1.11.1.1. Con: Ending gender inequality in divorce will not end all gender inequality, but incremental positive change is still important.
1.11.2. Pro: Women are more likely to suffer in dysfunctional marriages: incentives to not divorce therefore harm them more.
1.11.2.1. Pro: Women are more likely to be victims of [domestic abuse](http://www.refuge.org.uk/files/Statistics-domestic-violence-and-gender.pdf).
1.11.2.2. Con: Women initiate divorce proceedings [more often](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/homo-consumericus/201311/do-men-or-women-file-divorce-more-often) than men.
1.11.3. Pro: Stay-at-home mums, who make up the [vast majority](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2593027/Stay-home-fathers-double-20-years-229-000-look-children.html) of stay-at-home parents, are more economically vulnerable.
1.11.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.11.4. Pro: A 1992 study showed that out of 39 cases in the US concerning the enforceability of prenuptial agreements, in 33 the wife was the party looking to set aside the prenup \([Atwood, p.133](https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1262&context=jleg)\).
1.12. Con: Many people make fundamental life-altering changes throughout the course of a marriage that cannot be predicted at the time of signing a prenuptial agreement.
1.12.1. Con: When most people marry, they assume that a possible divorce will be mediated by a court. If their lives change, the way in which the court will mediate their divorce will change as well. Therefore, all marriage agreements - not just prenups, fail to account for the way that individuals' lives may change.
1.12.2. Con: Life is a constantly changing experience, and its uncertainty is one of the few guaranteed things in the world. Refusing to have a prenup is then similar to refusing to sign a lease or start a new career because you cannot predict what may happen in the future that would change how you interact with that contract.
1.12.2.1. Con: Leases and career contracts have end dates enshrined in the contract themselves, meaning that a person is not bound by that contract indefinitely. Couples with a prenup who end a marriage by divorce will always face the repercussions of having signed that contract.
1.12.2.1.1. Con: Similarly, individuals who sign a lease must face the repercussions if they break that contract, and couples with a prenup may never divorce. Repercussions are possible in both situations, and avoidable in both as well.
1.12.3. Pro: Many people make career changes over the course of their lives that cannot be predicted at the time of signing a prenuptial agreement.
1.12.4. Pro: It can be difficult to project into the future about how potential issues should be handled, and what may seem like an inconsequential compromise in the romantic premarital period may seem more monumental and burdensome later on.
1.12.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.4.
1.12.4.2. Pro: People about to commit to someone else for what they hope will be the rest of their lives find it hard to imagine the day they will ever feel the need to divorce that person, so might not take the negotiations of such an agreement as seriously as they should.
1.12.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.
1.12.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.3.4.1.
