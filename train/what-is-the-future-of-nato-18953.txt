Discussion Title: What is the future of NATO?

1. What is the future of NATO?
1.1. The NATO will turn into European Army, separating itself from the US influence.
1.1.1. Con: A European army would be easier to create based on the structures that already exist within the EU. Preserving and reforming NATO is not necessary for that.
1.1.2. Con: The biggest two contributors to NATO, the United States and Turkey, are not even European countries. It is therefore hard to imagine that NATO would turn into a European army.
1.1.3. Pro: The idea of European army exists almost as long as the EU
1.1.4. Con: The US is the biggest contributor to NATO and without them the alliance could be too weak
1.2. NATO will dissolve into national armies, that will be allied with each other in situations that will make former allies enemies
1.2.1. Pro: There is a growing discontent between the Western and Eastern EU countries.
1.2.2. Con: The NATO structures are already implemented and removing them would be very costly and counterproductive
1.3. NATO will survive in it's current state
1.3.1. Con: NATO was created for something very different from the current global situation.
1.3.2. Pro: As China is rising and Russia getting more assertive, NATO members have an interest in staying together.
1.3.3. Pro: Russia remains a threat to Europe.
1.3.4. Pro: NATO is the strongest military alliance in the world, so it could survive based on it's own strenght
1.4. NATO will grow, taking into countries from Africa and the rest of Europe
1.4.1. Pro: World is becoming even more globalized, and implementing countries from all around the globe could make NATO more responsive to problems that may hit it's core members.
1.4.2. Con: NATO based on it's name is limited in who it can implement, and countries that could be, might be too irrelevant to be taken into.
