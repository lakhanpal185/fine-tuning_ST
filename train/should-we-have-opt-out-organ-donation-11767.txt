Discussion Title: Should We Have Opt-Out Organ Donation?

1. We should have an opt-out system for organ donation.
1.1. Pro: Many people who might want to donate simply forget to sign up.
1.2. Con: The family of the deceased could get an emotional benefit from "choosing" to donate organs, which an opt-out program would not allow for.
1.2.1. Con: The benefits of organ donations are in saving the life of another. This is what families should gain emotional benefit from, not from their sense of altruism.
1.2.2. Pro: The death of a loved one is an emotional time. The emotional benefit can help soften grief, as families feel the death has served some type of positive role.
1.3. Pro: There is high support amongst civilians for opt-out organ donation schemes.
1.3.1. Pro: [82% of people](https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2018/august/opt-out-organ-donation-system-announced) support organ donation, with only 37% listed on the register; this will even the disparity.
1.3.2. Con: This doesn't eliminate the voices of those who [do not support](http://ccn.aacnjournals.org/content/22/6/44.full) it, and whose reservations deserve to be given weight.
1.3.3. Con: Such difficult issues cannot be fairly decided by popularity.
1.3.4. Pro: [Over 17,000 responses](https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2018/august/opt-out-organ-donation-system-announced) were received by the UK government when determining whether or not to introduce an opt-out system.
1.4. Con: The government does not own anyone. Your body is yours.
1.4.1. Con: This proposal doesn't force the governments will on anybody, as every citizen still has an opt-out
1.4.2. Con: Bodily autonomy, by definition, ends at the point of death.
1.4.2.1. Con: This is highly contentious. One can easily make plans whilst still alive for what happens to one's body; to say it simply ceases the moment life does is to undermine the autonomy held while alive.
1.5. Pro: Anyone opposed, either for religious or other purposes, would have an easy way to opt out.
1.5.1. Con: Even with wide reaching information campaigns, there is the risk that some people opposed to donating organs will not realise they are opted in.
1.5.1.1. Con: This is a risk worth taking.
1.5.1.2. Pro: This is an infringement of bodily autonomy.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.5.1.3. Con: If this is such a vital issue, then it the individuals' responsibility to ensure they have not been signed up.
1.5.2. Pro: Different religions have a [plethora of different beliefs](http://www.donorrecovery.org/learn/religion-and-organ-donation/) regarding organ donation, all of which can be accommodated with an opt-out system.
1.5.3. Pro: In places where it is being introduced, there are [transition periods](https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2018/august/opt-out-organ-donation-system-announced) to ensure nobody is treated unfairly.
1.6. Con: Someone who is opposed may pass away before having the opportunity to opt out \(unexpected or untimely death\).
1.6.1. Con: This can be easily averted by announcing the opt-out system well in advance of it entering into force, and by public information/education messages. That way everyone has the chance to opt-out before they are automatically opted in.
1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Medical autonomy is reached at the age of sixteen. It merely requires a letter in the post to inform those who are being automatically opted-in; they can then take whatever action they consider necessary.
1.7. Pro: Fewer people would pass away because they couldn't get a vital organ in time.
1.7.1. Pro: Organ recipients would have shorter waiting lists.
1.7.2. Pro: There is a shortage of organ donations in most countries.
1.7.2.1. Pro: [6,300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18261540) people died in the US in 2006 while waiting for an organ transplant.
1.7.2.2. Pro: In the UK, more than [6,500 people](http://www.theweek.co.uk/35635/automatic-organ-donation-the-pros-and-cons) need a transplant, yet only 3,500 transplants are carried out annually due to a shortage of organs donated.
1.7.2.3. Pro: [Sixteen people a day](http://ccn.aacnjournals.org/content/22/6/44.full) die in the US from lack of available organs.
1.7.3. Con: [Opt-out schemes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-41199918) do not always work.
