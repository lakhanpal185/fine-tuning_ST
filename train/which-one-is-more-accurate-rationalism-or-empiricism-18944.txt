Discussion Title: Which one is more accurate; Rationalism or Empiricism?

1. Which one is more accurate; Rationalism or Empiricism?
1.1. Rationalism is more accurate.
1.1.1. Pro: Empiricism an important theory to take into consideration, however rationalism is essential as without it society would tread in a generational cycle that lacks structural progression.
1.1.2. Pro: One must necessarily use reason to create useful conclusions out of empirical data. Empiricism cannot function alone.
1.1.3. Pro: Empiricism relies on human senses to prove truth. However, human senses are biased and often incorrect so empiricism is occasionally ineffective.
1.1.4. Pro: Mathematics are still provable without empirical evidence.
1.1.5. Pro: There is strong evidence to support that humans are rational actors.
1.1.6. Pro: Reason is impossible to disprove.
1.1.7. Con: Rationalism is out of touch with reality.
1.1.8. Con: Rationalism represents the universe as a closed system, which it is not.
1.2. Empiricism is more accurate.
1.2.1. Con: Since humans aren't blank slates, there has to be some knowledge that is innate and not empirically obtained.
1.2.2. Pro: Trial and error is the most fundamental way of obtaining progress in our civilization.
1.2.3. Con: You cannot rely on sense experience to verify sense experience.
1.2.4. Pro: The only way to acquire knowledge is through empirical research.
1.2.4.1. Con: Not true. If I said "all bachelors are single men" I've provided a true statement, therefore acquiring knowledge, without having to prove it through empirical research. Because the very definition of "a bachelor" is "a single man".
1.3. Rationalism helps our senses get in touch with the essence of objects and phenomena, for it is an idea that holds them together; whilst empiricism tests and validates their truth.
