Discussion Title: Should Mother Teresa have been canonized?

1. Mother Teresa should not have been canonized.
1.1. Con: Mother Teresa's dedication to helping the poor embodies a fundamental tenet of Christianity.
1.1.1. Con: She was also swept up in [controversy](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/mother-teresa-sainthood-canonized/) which can hardly be considered to embody Christianity. For example her financial connections to controversial powerful figures Charles Keating and Haiti's right-wing dictator Duvalier.
1.1.2. Con: The large amounts of donations from Christians and other contributors is largely untraceable. There is no clear demonstration of where this money has gone to. There are [estimations](http://The German magazine Stern estimated that only seven percent of the millions of dollars Teresa received was used for charity.) that only seven percent of the millions of dollars received was used for charity.
1.1.3. Con: Mother Teresa spent her life opposing one of the best known cures for poverty, which is the empowerment of women.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Mother Teresa had a [global crusade](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/mother-teresa-wasnt-a-saintly-person-she-was-a-shrewd-operator-with-unpalatable-views-who-knew-how-a7224846.html) against abortion and contraceptives which does not exactly boost women's rights.
1.1.3.2. Pro: In her [Nobel Prize](https://prishtinainsight.com/no-mother-teresa-poverty-not-beautiful/) speech, she made clear that abortion, not poverty, was a global catastrophe. “The greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a direct war, a direct killing – direct murder by the mother herself”.
1.1.4. Pro: Charitable actions were espoused by Jesus Christ and charity is [amongst](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a7.htm) the three 'theological virtues' of the Church.
1.1.5. Pro: There is no doubt that in eyes of the Church, Mother Teresa was a Christian role model and inspired many teachings in schools around the world about morals and Christianity.
1.1.5.1. Pro: Mother Teresa's actions [inspired](http://irelandtodaynews.com/index.php/cork-charity-founder-inspired-by-mother-teresa-says-more-robust-system-welcome/) charity, and a commitment to transparency.
1.1.6. Con: Mother Teresa is a [brand](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/mother-teresa-wasnt-a-saintly-person-she-was-a-shrewd-operator-with-unpalatable-views-who-knew-how-a7224846.html) for the Church and her canonisation can be considered as an “honour”. This not only ensures the longevity of the brand but ultimately continues to raise the profile of their mission, as well as bringing in considerable capital.
1.1.7. Con: Many people are dedicated to helping the poor, but these people do not usually become saints.
1.2. Pro: The conditions inside the shelters run by the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta were [terrible](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/02/25/why-to-many-critics-mother-teresa-is-still-no-saint/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f5b1038a2a51).
1.2.1. Pro: Mother Teresa has been accused of using her charities to [forcefully convert](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/22/mother-teresa-tried-to-brainwash-hindus-to-become-christians-and/) the poor and vulnerable.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Mother Teresa conspired to [“brainwash”](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/22/mother-teresa-tried-to-brainwash-hindus-to-become-christians-and/) Hindus into Christianity and helped fuel a violent military insurgency in India’s northeast according to Yogi Adityanath, an outspoken MP in the current BJP government.
1.2.1.2. Con: Mother Teresa did not see "active" evangelism as a necessary component of her ministry to the poor, writing "We never try to convert those who receive \[aid from Missionaries of Charity\] to Christianity but in our work we bear witness to the love of God’s presence..." \([Life in the Spirit: Reflections, Meditations and Prayers, pp. 81-82](https://www.challies.com/articles/the-myth-of-mother-teresa/)\).
1.2.1.3. Con: Mother Teresa [encouraged](https://www.challies.com/articles/the-myth-of-mother-teresa/) dying Hindus to pray to their own gods, revealing her universalist beliefs. It is unlikely that such a person would also coerce conversions.
1.2.1.4. Pro: Mother Teresa [instructed](https://books.google.ie/books?id=N4UxVZNER5EC&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=mother+teresa+baptism+dying&source=bl&ots=Z0uGNIRpQw&sig=jtnmcDt3YClUsGrf6K79K_LZ9UE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EwXtVOH8Aci7ggSChIKoAg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=mother%20teresa%20baptism%20dying&f=false) nuns to baptise those who were about to die even when they had no knowledge of the Church's teachings.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: If a person does not believe in the sacrament of baptism, then the act of forced baptism is little more than having a small amount of water poured over their head.
1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Even if the patient doesn't believe what the baptism represents, the church would still take credit for a "conversion", if it was documented. These "conversions" serve to unfairly bolster the membership in numbers argument of the church and it could be claimed that the Church acted in self-interest.
1.2.1.4.1.2. Con: A person of a different religious faith would find the act of forced baptism to be an affront to their particular faith and would likely find the situation distressing.
1.2.1.4.1.3. Con: Forced baptism is not necessarily against the teachings of the Catholic Church.
1.2.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Babies are regularly baptised despite being unable to consent to the sacrament.
1.2.1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: An inability to give affirmative consent to being baptised as a baby is not the same as being forcibly baptised against one's will as an adult \(or older child\) who has expressed that will, the latter of which can be very distressing.
1.2.2. Pro: Mother Teresa [romanticised](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/18/the-dark-side-of-mother-teresa/) poverty and encouraged people to refrain from trying to change their situations.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Mother Teresa once said that she believed that the suffering of poor people [helped](https://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/carol-hunt/mother-teresa-a-friend-of-poverty-not-of-the-poor-34301299.html) the world.
1.2.2.2. Pro: "There is something beautiful in seeing the poor accept their lot, to suffer it like Christ's Passion. The world gains much from their suffering," the journalist [Christopher Hitchens](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-hot-button/mother-teresa-was-anything-but-a-saint-canadian-study-says/article9317551/) reported her as saying.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: Mother Teresa believed that suffering- as Jesus did on the cross- could be an important religious experience, bringing the poor closer to God. While this belief may be ethically objectionable in a secular context, it is also likely [consistent with Catholic teaching](https://www.catholicparents.org/redemptive-suffering/) and therefore should not prevent her canonisation.
1.2.2.2.1.1. Con: While the acceptance of some inevitable suffering may be an aspect of Catholic teaching, parables like that of the Good Samaritan also call for Catholics to [do all they can](https://www.thedivinemercy.org/news/Does-Catholicism-Revel-In-Suffering-3633) to alleviate the suffering of others.
1.2.3. Pro: [Recent investigations](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/the-people-s-court-should-mother-teresa-be-stripped-off-bharat-ratna-1285432-2018-07-14) have revealed possible incidences of child-trafficking within the Missionaries of Charity clinics.
1.2.4. Pro: Even though her medical centres were meant to heal patients, conditions were so bad that often it made them even sicker. Mother Teresa’s Calcutta home for the sick had a mortality rate of more than [40 percent](http://allthatsinteresting.com/mother-teresa-saint).
1.2.5. Pro: Robin Fox, editor of the British Medical Journal "[The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(94\)92353-1/abstract)" described the care patients received as "haphazard."
1.2.5.1. Pro: The main location for “Missionaries of Charity” drew [comparisons](http://allthatsinteresting.com/mother-teresa-saint) and similarities from photographs of Nazi Germany’s Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Sisters and volunteers, who often had little to no medical knowledge were tasked with making decisions about patient care and treatment due to a lack of doctors.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Mother Teresa's order did not distinguish between curable and incurable patients, so that people who could otherwise survive would be at risk of dying from infections and lack of treatment.
1.2.5.4. Pro: Needles were rinsed with warm water, which left them inadequately sterilized, and the facility did not isolate patients with tuberculosis.
1.2.6. Pro: Mother Teresa may be synonymous with selflessness, but according to a team of [Canadian researchers](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-hot-button/mother-teresa-was-anything-but-a-saint-canadian-study-says/article9317551/) the nun's approach to caring for the sick was to glorify human suffering instead of relieving it.
1.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.2.
1.2.6.2. Pro: The study authors note that doctors visiting many of the 517 "homes for the dying" run by Mother Teresa observed unhygienic conditions and a shortage of actual care, food and painkillers.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: Lack of funds were no explanation, since Mother Teresa's order of the Missionaries of Charity had raised hundreds of millions in [aid money](http://www.srai.org/mother-teresa-where-are-her-millions/).
1.2.6.3. Pro: Volunteers were told to[refuse and reject offers](http://allthatsinteresting.com/mother-teresa-saint) of medical equipment that would save lives.
1.2.7. Con: Mother Teresa offered support to the dying [when no one else would](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/04/mother-teresa-admiration-sainthood-dying-kolkata). While far from perfect, her shelters were often the only supports offered to those who were dying.
1.2.7.1. Con: The fact that Mother Teresa offered services when others wouldn't is no reason to praise her in itself. She had the ability and resources to provide vastly better services, and her failure to do so was grossly negligent.
1.2.7.2. Con: Mother Teresa's organisation also had access to resources that no other organisation did. Keeping in mind the [millions](https://medium.com/\@KittyWenham/mother-teresas-sainthood-is-a-fraud-just-like-she-was-eb395177572) available to her and her, the treatment and shelters provided were horrendous.
1.2.8. Pro: Mother Teresa did not provide noteworthy healthcare to her patients, instead allowing them to [suffer and die](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/18/the-dark-side-of-mother-teresa/), as she believed that was God's will.
1.2.8.1. Pro: She[believed](http://allthatsinteresting.com/mother-teresa-saint) the suffering of the poor and sick was more of a glory than a burden.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.2.2.1.
1.2.9. Pro: Even today, the care provided by Mother Teresa's order is substandard.
1.2.9.1. Pro: A religious sister affiliated with and an employee of the [Missionaries of Charity](https://www.kialo.com/should-mother-teresa-have-been-canonized-16522/16522.0=16522.1+16522.10+16522.77+16522.240/+16522.240/edit) were arrested in India after allegedly selling a baby from a shelter of unwed mothers.
1.3. Pro: The evidence provided for her "miracles" is questionable.
1.3.1. Pro: A photograph of Mother Teresa allegedly cured Monica Besra's tumor. [Doctors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/the-vatican-believes-mother-teresa-cured-this-woman-but-was-it-a-miracle/2016/09/01/83664464-6e12-11e6-993f-73c693a89820_story.html?utm_term=.520a684eea49) maintained that she never had a cancerous tumor and only had a cyst that was cured due to the tuberculosis treatment she received.
1.3.1.1. Con: The [Congregation of the Causes of the Saints](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/did-mother-teresa-really-perform-miracles/), comprised of five doctors and headed by Professor Raffaele Cortesini, the head of surgery and transplantation at Rome University Medical School, certified both miracles and could find no medical explanation for the cures.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: We cannot trust a hospital linked closely with Rome and therefore the Catholic Church to be impartial and honest on this matter.
1.3.1.2. Con: [Dr. Mohan Seal](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/did-mother-teresa-really-perform-miracles/) of the Woodland Hospital in Calcutta admitted that Besra's case was inexplicable and that he could offer no medical explanation for her cure.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Not even the patient's [husband](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/18/the-dark-side-of-mother-teresa/) believed this "miracle".
1.3.2. Con: Evidence provided for any miracle is highly questionable.
1.3.3. Con: Many of the miracles performed by [Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles_of_Jesus) would have highly questionable evidence today in light of modern science and medicine.
1.3.4. Pro: Due to the miracle requirement for sainthood, these two miracles with Mother Teresa have been very much forced. Pressure from the Vatican and her devotees are willing these miracles to be true with little supporting [evidence](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/31/asia/mother-teresa-controversies/index.html) to consolidate them.
1.3.5. Pro: In the cases of [Marcilio Andrino](http://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/08/31/mother-teresa-cared-for-everybody-says-brazilian-man-cured-by-miracle/) and [Monica Basra](https://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php/articles/8109), “miracle” was defined as it always is in such matters as “medically inexplicable.” The evidence is therefore not positive, but negative, resulting in a logical fallacy called "argumentum ad ignorantiam"- “an argument from ignorance”- that is, a lack of knowledge. One cannot draw a conclusion from “we don’t know”.
1.3.5.1. Con: The Catholic approach to identifying a miracle is not "argument ad ignorantiam", insofar as Catholics have explicit faith that miracles can and do occur. The "negative" gap in the causal logic in this circumstance is bridged by Catholic belief in divine intervention.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: If it is impossible to extrapolate the occurrence of a miracle from a lack of scientific explanation for an event, then nothing can be a miracle. Given that miracles are a [core aspect](https://cruxnow.com/church/2016/05/09/a-crash-course-in-catholic-miracles/) of Catholic theology, this is inconsistent with Church teaching.
1.3.5.2. Pro: If God can perform such healing acts it raises the pertinent question- why he has chosen to repeat the process for many others who [suffer](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-03/questioning-the-miracles-of-saint-teresa/7809818) and pray?
1.3.5.2.1. Con: The Catholic Church espouses a [firm faith](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p3.htm) in God's [omnipotence.](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11251c.htm) This means that He can do anything. Whether or not he performed these particular acts on Mother Teresa's intercession, the Church is clear that he has the power to.
1.3.5.2.1.1. Pro: This means that these miracles offer no additional skeptical problems.
1.3.5.2.2. Con: The [logical problem of evil](https://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-log/) is created by any act of evil or harm which God allows. It is thus a far larger question than not curing all medical ailments.
1.3.5.2.3. Pro: If God did not cause the miracles, then they cannot be used for Mother Teresa's beatification and canonization because they are not miracles at all.
1.3.5.3. Pro: Even if science fails to explain medical recoveries, it is a logical leap to suggest that God or Mother Teresa caused them.
1.3.5.4. Pro: It is also theologically risky to make this claim. If science, in the future were to prove why a patient was cured, then this instance would cease to be a miracle.
1.4. Con: Miracles performed by Mother Teresa were recognized by the Church.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.4.2. Pro: It is a [requirement](http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-miracles-that-made-mother-teresa) that two miracles be recognised in order for a person to be recognised as a saint. One for the beatification and another for canonization.
1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.4.2.3. Pro: It is necessary to show that the miracle occurred because of the deceased persons [intercession](https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/the-process-of-becoming-a-saint.html) to God.
1.4.3. Con: These miracles are open to skepticism, even from a religious standpoint.
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.5.2.
1.5. Pro: Mother Teresa regularly [doubted](http://time.com/4126238/mother-teresas-crisis-of-faith/) the existence of God.
1.5.1. Con: Mother Teresa's views have remained consistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Mother Teresa's [views](http://www.ewtnireland.com/saints-john-paul-ii-mother-teresa-speak-ireland-abortion/) on abortion were in line with those of the Catholic Church.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: She [believed](http://allthatsinteresting.com/mother-teresa-saint) natural family planning and abstinence were the only ways for women not ready for children to protect themselves.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Even for rape victims, Mother Teresa [believed](http://allthatsinteresting.com/mother-teresa-saint/5) it was a sin to abort fetuses and viewed such acts as murder.
1.5.1.2. Con: This is not a reason to canonize someone - if it were, every devout lay person would be a saint.
1.5.2. Con: Roman Catholic spirituality deems Mother Teresa's doubts of faith as "[the dark night of the soul](http://blog.franciscanmedia.org/franciscan-spirit/mother-teresas-doubts-reveal-a-deep-faith)", a spiritual crisis in the journey towards a deepened union with God.
1.5.3. Pro: Mother Teresa's personal letters in the book [Come, Be My Light](http://blog.franciscanmedia.org/franciscan-spirit/mother-teresas-doubts-reveal-a-deep-faith) reveal her sense of abandonment by God.
1.5.4. Con: The fact that Mother Teresa experienced doubt is often [used](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/is-it-a-sin-to-doubt-gods-existence) as an example to provide comfort and guidance to other Catholics experiencing similar doubts.
1.5.5. Con: Her personal letters revealing her doubts of God were published by [Rev Brian Kolodiejchuk](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/24/wasmotherteresaanatheist), who also was responsible for promoting her canonisation. He collected and published her letters as part of the evidence that she really was a saint. He felt it would give her a new dimension to the way the public would understand her.
1.5.6. Con: Many deeply devout people often question their faith. As Mother Teresa always returned to her religion and her beliefs, this should not have prevented her from being canonized.
1.5.6.1. Pro: If one does not question, one can not really believe something. If one just accept things, it means that one actually never thought about it or didn't give the subject a certain degree of importance.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Experiencing and overcoming moments of theological doubt is a core aspect of the experience of Catholicism. Jesus [himself](http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm) cried out on the cross, asking God why he had forsaken him.
1.6. Pro: Mother Teresa is a symbol of [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Mother_Teresa), of a white woman swooping in to "rescue" people of colour.
1.6.1. Con: Mother Teresa worked against the oppressive system of "Untouchables" which was present in Calcutta, making her an opponent of discrimination and racial classism.
1.6.2. Con: It doesn't matter what color the person who helps is as long as something is done.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Catholic social teaching, as reflected in parables such as that of the Good Samaritan, [rejects](http://www.loyno.edu/jsri/sites/loyno.edu.jsri/files/CSTandRacism-Fall2009jsq.pdf) racial biases and calls for people to help each other without any regard to where they're from.
1.6.2.2. Pro: On the surface she achieved a lot in helping others. In 1950 she founded the Missionaries of Charity. She set up hospices, soup kitchens, schools, leper colonies and homes for abandoned children. She was named  the [Saint of the Gutters](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-37241762), for her work in the city's slums.
1.6.3. Pro: Mother Teresa's clinics provided low-quality care to the poor in Calcutta, but when she was sick, she travelled for treatment at a [modern American hospital](https://metro.co.uk/2016/03/16/mother-teresa-should-not-be-made-a-saint-and-heres-why-5754127/), revealing a double-standard.
1.6.3.1. Pro: She received the best healthcare in the world's top hospitals, while at her established home for the terminally ill, [Nirmal Hriday](https://gulfnews.com/opinion/thinkers/kolkata-will-take-a-century-to-recover-from-mother-teresa-1.1890218), there was a policy of reusing needles on the patients.
1.6.4. Con: Mother Teresa's [work](http://mattersindia.com/2016/09/an-interview-with-mother-teresa/) was not some "charity case" motivated by condescension or racism.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Although she was born in Albania and of Albanian descent, Mother Teresa understood her identity to be Albanian-Indian, [stating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa#International_charity), "By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the world."
1.6.4.2. Pro: Mother Teresa spoke [five languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa#International_charity) and lived a life which was very integrated with the local communities that she served.
1.6.4.3. Con: In fact, she was condescending and had a skewed [view](https://prishtinainsight.com/no-mother-teresa-poverty-not-beautiful/) of Indian people in poverty.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.1.
1.6.4.4. Pro: Mother Teresa [herself](https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/mother-teresa-belonged-to-the-world-and-india/story-0FtNvG1v5pIHs920q9ZpTJ.html) adopted Indian citizenship and received the highest Indian order. Many locals saw as fully part of the community rather than an outsider. There will be Indians of all faiths who love and respect her.
1.6.5. Pro: Mother Teresa was [born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa#Early_life) in Albania to Albanian parents, only traveling to India in her early 20s because she read about stories of missionaries in the East.
1.6.5.1. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.
1.6.6. Pro: Indian officials have criticized Mother Teresa for publicizing a stereotyped and inaccurate image of Calcutta as a city of poverty and suffering.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, mayor of Kolkata from 2005 to 2010, said that "she had no significant impact on the poor of this city", glorified illness instead of treating it and [misrepresented the city](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-india-mother-teresa-snap-story.html): "No doubt there was poverty in Calcutta, but it was never a city of lepers and beggars, as Mother Teresa presented it."
1.6.6.2. Con: These critics are not representative of the majority opinion. In fact, Mother Teresa was the Indian government's favorite naturalized citizen, honored with its highest civilian award, the [Bharat Ratna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Ratna), in 1980.
1.6.6.2.1. Con: Major political leaders have advocated for [revoking](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/rss-leader-says-mother-teresa-s-bharat-ratna-should-be-taken-away-if-charity-found-guilty-1283850-2018-07-12) Mother Teresa's Bharat Ratna, in light of allegations that a baby-selling scheme occurred under the cover of the Missionaries of Charity.
1.6.6.3. Pro: Aroup Chatterjee, a Kolkata-born physician, [said](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-india-mother-teresa-snap-story.html) when he moved to Britain to practice medicine in the mid-1980s, Westerners told him constantly that his city "must be horrible, because that's where Mother Teresa works."
1.6.6.4. Pro: Kolkata has had [lower income inequality](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-india-mother-teresa-snap-story.html) than other major cities, according to official statistics, and the state's per capita income is on par with the national average.
1.6.6.5. Pro: Mother Teresa's work exposed a poverty stricken portrayal of Calcutta to the West, whether intentional or not. The West did not see the [other side](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/opinion/05banerji.html) of the city, with its beautiful buildings and educated middle class. Nor its religious tolerance and rich cultural and literary life.
1.6.6.6. Con: Due to the nature of Mother Teresa's work, it was unavoidable to not show this side of Calcutta. Rather than ignore and hide such misery, her work raised awareness for the most marginalised people of the city.
1.6.6.7. Con: Mother Teresa is not solely responsible for this inaccurate image. [Western media](https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/198683) is also guilty of depicting a stereotyped image of Calcutta and India to the rest of the world. Often India is focussed upon as the home of floods and famines and more recently as a place of spiritual enlightenment.
1.6.7. Pro: Mother Teresa's charity is evocative of the [colonial past](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/opinion/05banerji.html). She was a Catholic European missionary who believed she knew best for third world communities; converting those close to death and condemning abortions.
1.6.7.1. Pro: [Many](https://www.thebetterindia.com/13279/68-inspiring-heroes-of-india/) Indians and local organisations have dedicated their lives to helping the poor, yet have not received a fraction of the recognition that Mother Teresa, a white European, received.
1.6.8. Con: The principle that individuals should travel to help the poor- wherever they are- and the specific tradition of missionary activity are very much in line with Church teaching.
1.6.8.1. Pro: Within the belief system of the Catholic Church, working to convert the poor is the ultimate act of charity because it can allow them access to heaven.
1.7. Con: Mother Teresa was a charismatic figure who generated much positive attention for the Church.
1.7.1. Con: Mother Teresa had relationships with many individuals who contributed to human suffering.
1.7.1.1. Pro: [Mother Teresa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJG-lgmPvYA) endorsed the regime of Enver Hoxha in Socialist Albania. His regime was well known for various acts of political repression, including executing somewhere between [5000-25000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Hoxha#Political_repressions_and_emigration) political opponents.
1.7.1.2. Pro: Mother Teresa accepted money from [Robert Maxwell,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/04/mother-teresas-legacy-under-cloud-as-sainthood-nears/) a British publisher who embezzled UK£450 million from his employee's pension funds.
1.7.1.3. Pro: [Mother Teresa](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1995/10/29/the-company-she-keeps/247eced4-f77b-413a-8615-b887b0127429/?utm_term=.1c6676a4aa72) accepted donations from and indeed praised Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, a man [accused](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/22/baby-doc-duvalier-investigation-stalls) of involvement in the murder and torture of thousands of opponents and of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from one of the poorest nations on earth.
1.7.1.4. Pro: [Mother Teresa](http://archivio.corriere.it/Archivio/interface/landing.html) supported Licio Gelli's nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Gelli was the head of the [Propaganda Due masonic lodge](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12054716/Licio-Gelli-financier-obituary.html), an organisation implicated in various murders and high-profile corruption cases in Italy. The organisation also had ties to the Argentine military junta and the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement.
1.7.1.5. Pro: Mother Teresa produced a character statement on behalf of [Charles Keating](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/mother-teresa-sainthood-canonized/), a man who plead guilty to four counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud. Charles Keating had donated millions to Mother Teresa and had even provided her with a personal jet during her visit to the United States.
1.7.1.6. Pro: Mother Teresa [publicly supported](https://swarajyamag.com/lite/emergency-supporters-a-list-that-will-surprise-you) "The Emergency" enacted by Indira Gandhi's government, which [included](http://www.india.com/education/emergency-in-india-during-1975-atrocities-and-acts-during-emergency-1581724/) forceful exclusion of people from private properties, searching of houses without warrants, killing people with ‘suspicion’ without any trial and many other such practices which were certainly not democratic.
1.7.1.7. Pro: Mother Teresa was instrumental in protecting the job of a [priest who was removed from ministry for child abuse](http://www.sfweekly.com/news/tainted-saint-mother-teresa-defended-pedophile-priest/), writing a letter in support of allowing him to return to ministry, where he continued his predatory actions.
1.7.2. Pro: The survival of any religion depends upon people choosing to join the religion or, if born into the religion, choosing to remain a member of it. A religion with a positive reputation is more likely to attract and retain followers.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.7.4. Pro: There would be increased risk of a perception of a lack of appreciation for such effort. The lack of distinction could demotivate future faithful from doing tasks that help other human beings.
1.7.5. Pro: According to Gallup poll data, Mother Teresa was the [most admired](https://news.gallup.com/poll/3367/mother-teresa-voted-american-people-most-admired-person-century.aspx) person of the 20th century in the U.S.
1.7.6. Con: The canonization of Mother Teresa attracted much [controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Mother_Teresa), as elements of her ministry were criticized- generating negative public attention.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Christopher Hitchens and Aroup Chatterjee were called by the Vatican to [testify](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2010/08/mother_teresa_the_final_verdic.html) against Mother Teresa at her canonization hearing.
1.7.6.1.1. Con: The British writer [Christopher Hitchens](https://nationalpost.com/holy-post/charles-lewis-christopher-hitchens-an-enemy-of-religion-a-true-inspiration-to-atheists) was a strong Atheist and renowned for his profound scepticism of religion. Therefore it is no surprise he would be anti-Mother Teresa, one of the biggest icons of modern Christianity and had no qualms in [referring](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/mother-teresa-wasnt-a-saintly-person-she-was-a-shrewd-operator-with-unpalatable-views-who-knew-how-a7224846.html) to her as 'a lying, thieving Albanian dwarf'.
1.7.6.1.2. Con: Appointing a 'devil's advocate' to argue against a canonisation in order to identify flaws in a candidate is [standard practice](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01168b.htm) within the Church. It does not indicate any particular controversy regarding Mother Teresa.
1.7.6.2. Con: In order to be [canonized](https://gulfnews.com/opinion/thinkers/kolkata-will-take-a-century-to-recover-from-mother-teresa-1.1890218) as a Catholic Saint one does not exactly have to be saintly or nice in the secular sense, but only has to be pure to Catholic dogma.
1.7.7. Con: It is unclear what meaningful impact is created by "positive attention".
1.7.7.1. Con: Even in the years after Mother Teresa's death, due to the influence of her [positive reputation](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2013/04/mother-teresa-and-her-critics), the Missionaries of Charity have expanded their work, now serving people in need in 50 countries.
1.7.7.1.1. Pro: Even if latterly her work has received controversy and her sainthood is questionable, Mother Teresa and her organisation has [inspired](https://metro.co.uk/2016/03/16/mother-teresa-should-not-be-made-a-saint-and-heres-why-5754127/) many humanitarian workers whose actions have truly relieved suffering and addressed the causes of poverty.
1.7.7.2. Con: -> See 1.7.2.
1.7.8. Con: Mother Teresa's publicity may have obscured attention to the [scandal of pedophilia](https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/nelson-jones/2012/01/mother-teresa-mcguire-abuse) among Catholic priests.
1.7.8.1. Con: Mother Teresa is being revered for her selflessness, not for her strength as a judge of character. It was not her responsibility to judge those around her, and she would have been compelled by her faith to favor forgiveness of any individual.
1.7.8.2. Pro: Catholic church sex abuse scandals began to surface in the late 20th century, when Mother Teresa was at the height of her popularity, but only garnered widespread attention in the early 21st century \(by which time Mother Teresa had died\).
1.7.8.2.1. Con: Sexual abuse by the Catholic Church received extensive media coverage in the 1990's.
1.7.8.2.1.1. Pro: Criminal cases and government inquiries surrounding child sex abuse by the Catholic Church began to take place in Ireland in the 1990s.
1.7.8.2.1.2. Pro: Abuse in Newfoundland, Canada, was first reported on in December 1989 by the newspaper, St John's Sunday Express.
1.7.8.3. Con: -> See 1.7.8.2.1.
1.7.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.7.
1.8. Con: Mother Teresa's organisation, "The Missionaries of Charity" has [benefited](https://epicpew.com/mother-teresas-legacy-10-facts-missionaries-charity/) many people across the world, most of them poor and vulnerable.
1.8.1. Con: Her stances on poverty, contraception and abortion directly contributed to human misery.
1.8.1.1. Con: Mother Teresa's actions directly alleviated human suffering and assisted those in poverty.
1.8.1.2. Con: Mother Teresa's stances on these issues are in line with all other Saints as she followed the Church's teachings on these issues.
1.8.1.2.1. Pro: Catholic social teaching forbids both [contraception](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/contraception_1.shtml) and [abortion](https://www.catholic.com/tract/abortion). Had Mother Teresa been in favour of these practices, she would be ineligible for canonisation.
1.8.1.3. Pro: In 1999 129,000 people in Calcutta had [HIV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9604543). As Mother Teresa discouraged condom use, she can be held responsible for at least some of this number.
1.8.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.8.1.5. Pro: She opposed contraception, despite evidence all around her of the misery caused by [overpopulation](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-south-asia-13836067/calcutta-s-15-million-bursting-at-the-seams).
1.8.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.2.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.7.1.
1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.8.4. Con: Mother Teresa's "[selfless](http://allthatsinteresting.com/mother-teresa-saint)" intentions were not selfless. An ulterior motive pervade- to convert vulnerable people to Christianity in order to fuel the expansion of her fundamentalist Catholic beliefs.
1.8.4.1. Pro: In a city where the majority are of the Hindu faith, Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity [baptised](https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2fnews%2fworldviews%2fwp%2f2015%2f02%2f25%2fwhy-to-many-critics-mother-teresa-is-still-no-saint%2f%3f) the dying without their permission.
1.8.5. Con: Her work and organisation has indirectly [harmed](https://gulfnews.com/opinion/thinkers/kolkata-will-take-a-century-to-recover-from-mother-teresa-1.1890218) the identity of Calcutta and its residents for decades. Clouding the city in a reputation of poverty and warping people's perspective of the city, has consequently impeded business and tourism.
1.8.6. Pro: The Missionaries of Charity [cared for people with leprosy](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/mother-teresa-the-saint-who-fought-against-stigma-of-leprosy-55416), who were oftentimes shunned by other charities due to the contagious nature of the disease.
1.8.6.1. Pro: Mother Teresa [fought](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/mother-teresa-the-saint-who-fought-against-stigma-of-leprosy-55416) against the stigma associated with leprosy by creating a Leprosy Fund to teach people about the disease.
1.8.6.2. Pro: Mother Teresa set up [mobile clinics](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/mother-teresa-the-saint-who-fought-against-stigma-of-leprosy-55416) to provide people with lepresy with bandages and medicine at home.
1.8.7. Pro: Her humanitarian work led her to win the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1979/teresa-facts.html).
1.8.8. Con: At the same time, this organisation was responsible for perpetration of [abuse and neglect.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/world/asia/mother-teresa-critic.html)
1.8.9. Con: The organisation mishandled funds which could have been used to help many more people.
1.8.9.1. Pro: Mother Teresa saved donations made to her fund in the [Vatican Bank](http://Mother Teresa saved donations made to her fund in the Vatican Bank. She never withdrew most of the funds because, if she had, the bank would have gone into default.). She never withdrew most of the funds because, if she had, the bank would have gone into default.
