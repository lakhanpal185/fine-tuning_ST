Discussion Title: The United States should abolish the capital gains tax

1. The United States should abolish the capital gains tax.
1.1. Pro: Abolishing capital tax gains will make it possible to close the carried interest tax loophole.
1.1.1. Pro: The tax break has helped private equity become one of the most lucrative sectors of the financial industry
1.1.1.1. Pro: Since the end of the recession, private equity has reported record profits, and at least eighteen private-equity executives are estimated to be worth two billion dollars or more each.
1.2. Pro: Abolishing capital gains tax leads to economic growth.
1.2.1. Pro: A business is more likely to find ways to protect its capital from taxation, or to relocate all or a part of its operations overseas. Investors are less likely to risk their own capital if a larger percentage of their profits are taken. For every type of tax, there is a threshold rate above which the incentive to produce more diminishes, thereby reducing the amount of revenue the government receives.
1.2.2. Con: This is literally trickle down theory. There is little to no evidence that trickle down actually works.  There is certainly no evidence of it working in such a big country like the US[faireconomy.org](http://www.faireconomy.org/trickle_down_economics_four_reasons)
1.2.3. Con: aurther laffer was the economic advisor to regan and donald j trump
1.2.4. Con: Those in favor of lowering, or even eliminating, capital gains taxes say it will spur more investment in the U.S. economy. But the growing gap between America's rich and poor has given a new voice to advocates of raising captial gains taxes, which is seen by some as a major income divider.
1.2.4.1. Con: no source
1.2.5. Pro: 1. Economic Productivity and Growth – When deciding tax policy, the government should focus on economic growth and productivity. Eliminating the capital gains tax has been shown to increase average household real income as well as economic growth. The tax should be eliminated because it encourages people to use their money, purchase/sell goods, and invest.
1.2.5.1. Con: but they will do it anyways
1.2.5.2. Con: no source
1.2.5.3. Con: There isn't any way to fully ensure individuals will use their money, purchase/sell goods, and invest.
1.2.5.4. Con: It will not affect average household real income. In 2005, the top 5% of households received 90% of capital gains income. The remaining 10% of capital gains income spread out over the remaining 95% of households would hardly make a difference.
[The Economic Effects of Capital Gains Taxation from the Congressional Research Service dtd 6/18/2010](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40411.pdf)
1.2.5.5. Pro: but the buisnesses will lose money
1.2.5.5.1. Con: It is illogical that by reducing capital gains tax all businesses will suffer. Yes, some will, and the rich will gain even more money, but evidence is needed to prove this.
1.2.5.5.1.1. Pro: The money that you make is your's and your's alone it is not the companies, they will not lose money
1.2.6. Pro: The [Laffer Curve theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laffercurve.asp#ixzz55OzyUMEY) shows that if cap gains tax is cut, it would actually increase overall government tax revenue collected by the government from other sources of revenue due to an increase in economic activity, investment, and production.
1.2.7. Pro: There is a distinct pattern throughout [American history](https://www.heritage.org/taxes/report/the-historical-lessons-lower-tax-rates): When tax rates are reduced, the economy's growth rate improves and living standards increase.
1.2.7.1. Con: Heritage.org is a right-wing think tank and not reliable.
1.2.8. Pro: Abolishing capital gains tax reduces investment.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Investors risked their money with the investment and deserve the earnings.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: They are still gaining money overall.
1.2.8.1.1.1. Con: But the value of items could go down and there's no consolidation for that.
1.2.8.1.2. Con: no evedence
1.2.8.1.2.1. Con: its a fact though that investors do lose some of their earnings even if it isn't a lot
1.2.8.2. Pro: Capital gains are taxed on a realization basis. This means that the tax is only imposed when an investor opts to withdraw his or her investment from the market and realize the capital gain. One of the most significant economic effects is the incentive this creates for owners of capital to retain their current investments even if more profitable and productive opportunities are available. Economists refer to this result as the "lock-in" effect. [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmitchell/2014/11/07/the-overwhelming-case-against-capital-gains-taxation/#30d435f83b0a)
1.2.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.1.
1.2.10. Pro: According to the Fraser Institute, “[Capital gains taxes make capital investments more expensive and therefore less investment occurs](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/09/28/eliminate-taxes-on-capital-gains)." Hence, abolishing capital gains completely would, in fact, encourage investment, growing the economy, and allowing businesses and jobs to flourish.
1.2.10.1. Pro: It would also help millennials \(known as the '[boomerang generation](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-03-parents-miserable-boomerang-home-lse.html)' for returning home after college\) out by decreasing housing prices enough to entice them to move out.
1.3. Con: State revenues will decrease if capital gains taxes are abolished, which will force colleges to increase tuition.
1.3.1. Pro: In 2007 capital gains tax revenue was [$123 billion](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40411.pdf).
1.3.2. Pro: When state revenues reduce this would have to be balanced by shrinking the budget or increasing borrowing.
1.3.2.1. Pro: all taxes made 2.6 trillion dollars on taxes last year so the 40 thousand dollars that was from capital gains tax isn't that much money. its not critical money that the government needs
1.3.2.1.1. Con: false
1.3.2.2. Pro: A review of government revenue trends released by the Congressional Budget Office in 2010 found that capital gains taxes accounted for an average of about 9.2 percent.
1.3.2.3. Pro: If the tax is abolished, investors will hoard their earnings, which would create an economic standstill. Taxes stimulate the economy by placing it in projects that encourage economic activity, such as infrastructure bills.
1.3.2.4. Con: no source
1.4. Pro: Taxes in the US are too high already. Thus, taxes should be lowered instead of high \(especially the high capital gains tax\).
1.4.1. Pro: "United States has one of the highest capital gains tax rates in the [world](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmitchell/2014/11/07/the-overwhelming-case-against-capital-gains-taxation/#25da5d533b0a)."
1.4.1.1. Con: The US government benefits from a high captal gains tax. This justifies it's high rate.
1.4.2. Pro: When tax is increased, the rich stop working as hard. [slate.com](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/02/if_they_tax_do_we_relax.html)
1.4.3. Con: The rich avoid paying their fare
1.4.3.1. Con: no source
1.4.3.2. Pro: The capital gains tax allows for tax evasion by the wealthy. [urban.org](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/66936/1000257-Capital-Gains-Taxation-and-Tax-Avoidance.PDF)
1.4.3.2.1. Pro: Abolishment of the capital gain tax will lead to massive tax avoidance, as there are well known methods that will mask ordinary income as capital gain \(such as deferred equity grants, stock options e.t.c.\)
1.4.3.2.1.1. Con: no source
1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: The examples are well known. Take a look at [Carried interest](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-carried-interest-and-how-should-it-be-taxed) which is a great example how salary / commissions are structured as capital gains.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2. Con: The source is looking around us! Think about Trump, and many others. If we pass the resolve, still more will join.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con: There is no evidence for this.
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The evidence is [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/donald-trump-tax.html)
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Seeing is the New York Times is a reliable source, this is a reasonable claim \(source: look around us claim\)
1.4.3.2.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: But does this evidence support the original claim?
1.4.3.2.1.2. Con: This will more likely happen if the tax is not abolished.
1.4.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: More tax means more tax avoidance!
1.4.4. Con: If we abolish the Capital Gains Tax we can replace it with a better tax which would only effect rich people so that lower income families can still get money while those who can pay will pay.
1.4.4.1. Con: but we're talking about only capital gains tax
1.4.4.2. Con: Can't give an alternative suggestion \(against debate rules\)
1.4.4.3. Con: I'm a little confused on what your claim is, if i'm understanding correctly this would continue the disproportional benefit to wealthy rather than low income.
1.4.5. Con: We are already taxed enough so getting rid of another tax will not change the economic place of the U.S. But this will help people making less income or none at all. Infact usa today says that the average 38 year old pays about 14,000 dollars per year in state taxes. [usatoday.com](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2017/10/07/a-foolish-take-how-much-does-the-average-american-pay-in-taxes/106237216/)
1.5. Con: Capital gains taxes mostly affect the wealthy. Abolishing them is not beneficial for equality in the country.
1.5.1. Con: the government is taking money from hard working citizens
1.5.1.1. Con: this is a pro contention you are just supporting the other side
1.5.1.2. Con: but the goverment wouldnt run therefor making it worse for them
1.5.1.3. Con: Capital gains taxes only apply on investments where profits are made, investing is not the same thing as working for income. Most Americans make their money from income and wage paying jobs, not by making profits off investments. Many people who make money off investments and capital gains are wealthy and don't depend on income.
1.5.1.4. Con: no source
1.5.1.4.1. Con: You don't need a source, this is a simple idea.
1.5.1.5. Con: Most of these people are just investing money and sitting around.
1.5.2. Pro: Out of the 1% of the U.S. economy that is made up of rich people why not instead keep this tax and raise taxes for people with more the 2-3 houses or make more then a specific income. Also lower the taxes for people with a low income.[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-raising-taxes-on-the-rich-is-good-economics/)
1.5.2.1. Pro: Lowering taxes helps the economy. From the Washington Post .  [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/22/5-things-to-do-before-jan-1-to-lower-your-tax-bill/?utm_term=.b5e94102c48e)
1.5.3. Pro: It's true that not only rich people have capital gains, but the overwhelming majority of gains are earned by people with very high incomes.  70 percent go to those in the top 1 percent.  Most middle income people hold stocks through 401\(k\) plans, which are not affected by capital gains tax

\(washington post\)
1.5.3.1. Pro: This resolve benefits only the wealthy – Poor and middle class people generally don’t make much from capital gains. People investing in stocks and things are usually wealthier. In fact, the data shows pretty clearly that the majority of people paying capital gains taxes are wealthier than most Americans. If you eliminate the tax, you don’t actually help people that we would rely on for economic growth, you just help the wealthy. So, there’s no point in eliminating it.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: no source
1.5.3.1.1.1. Con: It is a fact nevertheless. "Only 11 percent of what we're calling middle-class people report capital gains, while 51 percent of wealthier people report it."[- Politifact](http://So only 11 percent of what we're calling middle-class people report capital gains, while 51 percent of wealthier people report it.)
1.5.3.1.1.1.1. Con: How do we know that nobody is hiding the truth?
1.5.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This is the most reliable information we have currently, so we must rely on this idea.
1.5.3.1.1.1.2. Con: This is probably not a poll on the entire population, so we could find very different results when everyone reports.
1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.
1.5.5. Pro: It would be good for people who earn less money from their capital gains.
1.5.5.1. Con: The costs of collecting the tax are so high that tax income is marginal.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: The capital gains tax is so large that it can make the profit margin too small for low-margin capital investments. People can end up losing money when factoring in the associated costs.
1.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: The capital gains tax is giving an [unfair advantage to the top 0.1% \(anyone making more than $34,500 a year in wages\) because they get a higher profit margin.  Salary is also taxed at a higher rate than a billionaire \(who can hide their capital earnings\)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/capital-gains-tax-rates-benefiting-wealthy-are-protected-by-both-parties/2011/09/06/gIQAdJmSLK_story.html?utm_term=.280a77eaf8ad), which compounds the issue.
1.5.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Low capital gain taxes are mainly a way for the rich to avoid paying their fair share. The richest 1% of the world's population now owns 50% of its total wealth, according to a report by Credit Suisse. Worldwide, there are 34 million people who have a U.S. dollar net worth of at least $1 million, or 0.7% of the global adult population, and they account for 45% of global wealth. The rich don't need to pay less taxes, they should be paying MORE taxes.[fortune.com](http://fortune.com/2015/10/14/1-percent-global-wealth-credit-suisse/)
1.5.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This may be true, but really is a sloppy way to solve the problem of history.
1.5.5.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Studies show that 70 percent of capital gains go to people in the top 1 percent of income.                              the balence is the source
1.5.5.1.2. Pro: This issue decreases entrepreneurship, because it creates a "substantial impact on the reallocation of capital" \(i.e. LLC - land, labor, and capital\) to the point that the capital gains taxes "reduce returns on investment".  [forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmitchell/2014/11/07/the-overwhelming-case-against-capital-gains-taxation/#170fe3693b0a)
1.5.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.1.
1.5.5.2. Con: There is no evidence, it is just an idea.
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: they need to have specific proof of this
1.5.5.3. Con: it would be the money that investors make and Isn’t 15% of your money being taxed better instead of 30%.
1.5.5.3.1. Con: how is this a rebuddle it just proves that without capital gains poorer people with investments would make more money
1.5.6. Con: Asking the wealthy for more of their economic participation in society helps solve issues of inequality for the masses.
1.6. Con: People who make a living off investing would pay no income tax at all. That would constitute an unfair system with respect to the people who derive their income from a salary.
1.6.1. Con: no source
1.6.1.1. Con: Although we can probably say this is true, because it is the most logical thing for people to do.
1.7. Pro: Abolishing capital gains tax favors labor and savings instead of capital income.
1.7.1. Pro: Labor efforts and savings have a more [pernicious effect](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/08/16/should-we-stop-taxing-capital-gains/eliminate-impediment-to-growth) as savings finances capital formation.
1.7.2. Pro: [Abolishing capital gains tax will reduce the long term capital gain from patents.](https://pf.millennialsd.com/2018/01/01/resolved-the-united-states-should-abolish-the-capital-gains-tax-bibliography/)
1.7.3. Pro: People make investments in businesses and take risks. A capital gains tax makes the investment choice even riskier. If a person loses their investment, the loss is compounded even greater with the high capital gains tax
1.7.3.1. Pro: At one time, you could have bought half interest in McDonald’s for $25,000 — and there were no takers. Anyone who would have risked $25,000 at that time would be a billionaire today. But there was no guarantee at the time that they wouldn’t be just throwing 25 grand down a rat hole. And to tax that would be even more money loss.[capitalismmagazine.com](http://capitalismmagazine.com/2014/02/pros-cons-capital-gains-taxes/)
1.7.3.2. Pro: A small capital gains tax allows a better buffer for money loss if the investment loss is greater than expected. This could help a person avoid bankruptcy.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: This is better because a person can recover from an investment to live their life and possibly pursue more and better investments. One investment should not destroy a person's life.
1.7.3.2.2. Pro: People avoiding bankruptcy could free up the court system in costs/efforts and for it to focus on more serious matters \(such as crime\).
1.7.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.1.
