Discussion Title: What Is The Best Diet For Human Health And Well Being?

1. What is the best diet or dietary approach for health and well being?
1.1. The best diet is the Mediterranean Diet.
1.1.1. Con: Some nutrients present in some Mediterranean diet-recommended produce are not beneficial for human consumption.
1.1.1.1. Con: Every food has, but a plant-based diet gives way to more benefits than harms.
1.1.1.2. Pro: [Phytic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytic_acid#Food_science), as phytate, is an anti-nutrient present in legumes, a main staple of the Mediterranean diet. In the body, phytic acid heavily binds to essential minerals like iron, calcium, and zinc making them less absorbable in the intestines.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: [Phytic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytic_acid#Medical_uses) is a necessary nutrient to regulate vital cellular functions, and has anti-carcinogenic effects in the body.
1.1.2. Pro: It's very compatible with traditional recipes.
1.1.2.1. Pro: With no strict prohibition on starches or meats most traditional dishes, such as pasta, curry,  paella, sushi etc.  could be served or adapted to this plan.
1.1.2.2. Pro: It's easy to participate in traditional celebratory meals on this plan.
1.1.3. Pro: The Mediterranean diet is based on fresh products.
1.1.4. Pro: The Mediterranean diet has a wealth of scientific evidence, to support it as a healthy nutritious diet.
1.1.4.1. Con: The foods and eating habits of people from Greece cannot be the best diet for everyone because it does not take into account the differences in nutritional needs of people from other parts of the world.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: [Approximately 60%](http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2005/06/lactose-intolerance-linked-ancestral-struggles-climate-diseases)of people of African or Asian descent cannot effectively process or utilize dairy. The Mediterranean diet promotes eating eggs, cheese, and yogurt.
1.1.4.2. Pro: A large randomised controlled trial supports the Mediterannean diet as heart healthy, reducing heart attacks and strokes in adherents. 

[Benefits of the mediterranean style diet.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/study-supports-heart-benefits-from-mediterranean-style-diets-201302255930)
1.1.4.2.1. Con: The [DASH diet](https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20130108/dash-diet-ranked-best#1) ranked #1 diet out of 29 for blood pressure and overall heart health.
1.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: The [DASH diet](http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/38/2/155) \(Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension\) is also heart healthy, reducing blood pressure and chance of stroke. Its supported by the American Heart Association and the American Kidney Foundation. It may be a better option.
1.1.5. Pro: The broad range of foods permitted, should make a Mediterranean plan somewhat easy to follow.
1.1.5.1. Pro: You are permitted carbohydrate based foods, some meat, fish, and some dairy. Most food types are included.
1.1.5.2. Pro: You could eat out easily on this diet plan. These foods are common in many restaurants, and styles of cuisine.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Standard restaurant food, such as a Italian, may be to rich for this plan, despite conforming to the diet somewhat.
1.2. The best dietary approach for health and well-being is eating everything in moderation based on individual needs.
1.2.1. Pro: Due to the wide range of food allergies, medical conditions, and other common dietary restrictions, it stands to reason that each person should be aware of their body's individual needs and plan their own diets accordingly.
1.2.2. Con: Sometimes the most precise "needs", are not immediately available, and usually in that case, we can take the regard that a natural justice is being served, and conclude that diets are defined by availability as well as need and/or want.
1.2.3. Pro: Some people need more sugar, carbs, or protein. Therefore, eating specifically based on what the individual body needs may be best.
1.3. The best diet is a Whole Foods Plant Based Diet.
1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3.2. Pro: Eating a whole food plant based diet has been shown to reverse many chronic diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5466941/)
1.3.3. Con: Veganism is a very restrictive diet.
1.3.4. Pro: The[Seventh-Day Adventist Vegetarian Diet](https://www.adventist.org/en/vitality/health/) is a whole foods plant-based diet that has been shown to help those who follow to live healthier, happier and longer with reduced stress levels than those following other diet plans. Residents of Loma Linda, CA are an [example](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/02/the-lovely-hill-where-people-live-longer-and-happier/272798/).
1.3.5. Pro: It's ethically appealing to many people.
1.3.5.1. Pro: A diet that's kind to animals gives people meaning in their lives.
1.3.6. Con: It's awkward to eat out.
1.3.7. Pro: The diet is high in fibre.
1.3.8. Pro: Despite the restrictions, it is versatile.
1.3.8.1. Pro: A surprising amount of traditional and typical recipes can be replicated with this diet.
1.3.9. Con: Most people aren't vegan, it isn't so popular.
1.3.10. Pro: This diet contains a lot of fruit and vegetables, which are known to be health promoting.
1.3.10.1. Con: Fruits and veggies contain carbohydrates which are unnecessary for human health, and fiber, which is unneeded for our digestion. There are questionable links between eating such plants and health, they may simply be less bad than other processed or sugary foods. Plants also contain natural pesticides which may do harm to our own cells.
1.3.10.1.1. Con: A low fiber diet is identified as a likely cause of [diverticulitis](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/tc/diverticulitis-topic-overview#1).
[Evidence](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/diverticulitis-diet#1)suggests that a high fiber diet can alleviate diverticulitis, and countries with higher fiber consumption have lower incidence.

All this suggests that fiber is necessary for our digestion, as diverticulitis is a digestive illness.
1.3.10.2. Pro: Major health authorities recommend lots of fruit and vegetables.
1.3.10.2.1. Pro: The [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/The-American-Heart-Associations-Diet-and-Lifestyle-Recommendations_UCM_305855_Article.jsp) \(AHA\) recommends eating a variety of fruits and vegetables at every meal to promote good heart health.
1.3.10.2.1.1. Con: The AHA cannot be trusted as it is an arm of Big Sugar and Big Grain. [www.latimes.com](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-teicholz-big-sugar-saturated-fats-20160927-snap-story.html) "including donations to Chicago cardiologist Jeremiah Stamler, who authored that first AHA guideline condemning saturated fats. Stamler also benefited from the largesse of the Corn Products Co., which published a version of Stamlerâ€™s pro-vegetable-oils diet book bound in red leather"
1.3.11. Pro: You can eat high volumes of these high fibre foods, if you want.
1.3.12. Con: Veganism doesn't work for everyone's constitutional health needs.
1.3.12.1. Pro: Some people cannot handle the high amount of grains on a vegan diet.
1.3.13. Pro: The plant based diet is good for combating heart disease.
1.4. The best dietary approach for health and well-being is intermittent fasting.
1.4.1. Pro: [Intermittent fasting](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/11/intermittent-fasting-may-be-center-of-increasing-lifespan/), or fasting 1-2 days a week, has been shown to increase lifespan in some animal models.
1.4.1.1. Con: Study does not control for total calories consumed, it is still highly possible that the thesis stated in [Thesis 3](https://www.kialo.com/what-is-the-best-diet-for-human-health-and-well-being-7121/7121.0=7121.235) is accurately evidenced by this study.
1.4.1.2. Con: Nematodes of 1mm in length cannot be accurately extrapolated to represent mammals or humans
1.5. The best diet would be sustainable, easily accessible foods that are resource-conserving without harming other beings \(animals, plants...\).
1.5.1. Pro: Foods that do not need refrigeration are better than those that do.
1.5.1.1. Pro: Refrigerated foods go bad and could make people sick if they eat them.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Dry foods are more accessible, especially for emergency situations.
1.5.2. Pro: Eating parts of plants that regrow seems more sustainable than cutting down the plant and putting in new seeds for new plants to grow.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Constantly cycling through crops strips soil \(especially without crop rotation\). This does not occur with trees that produce every year \(like olive trees\).
1.5.3. Pro: [Vertical farming can be a source of easily accessible foods.](https://www.kialo.com/vertical-farming-is-the-future-of-agriculture-7487/7487.0=7487.1/=7487.1)
1.5.4. Pro: Eating foods with high bioavailability/low antinutrients \([1](https://www.jssm.org/vol3/n3/2/v3n3-2pdf.pdf), [2](http://www.eufic.org/en/food-today/article/nutrient-bioavailability-getting-the-most-out-of-food), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23107545), [4](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/impact-of-antinutritional-factors-in-food-proteins-on-the-digestibility-of-protein-and-the-bioavailability-of-amino-acids-and-on-protein-quality/052B66B8F1BA8DBBCEE94E3607A63402), [5](http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/6265/1/Bioavailability-How-the-Nutrients-in-Food-Become-Available-to-Our-Bodies.html)\) would help to conserve resources \(less food is needed, because more nutrients are absorbed per bite\) and is healthier too \(the body can access what it needs instead of being malnourished\).
1.5.5. Pro: These foods tend to be healthier.
1.5.6. Con: One way or another, to feed 8 billion people daily, something is going to be harmed \(earth, animals, plants....\).
1.6. The best diet is eating/drinking less or not at all \(if possible\).
1.6.1. Pro: There are a few tricks to get in this direction of eating less right now before better technologies come along \(like a [food replacement pill](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a8787/why-dont-we-have-food-replacement-pills-15248871/)\).
1.6.1.1. Pro: People who weigh less require a lower caloric intake to maintain their body weight than those who weigh more.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Getting ill and injured less often will allow the body to not need as much resources to recover from those events.
1.6.1.3. Pro: Sedentary lifestyles require less calories than high level activity ones.
1.6.1.4. Pro: Nutrient-rich foods allow people to be full and get adequate nutrition from lower food quantities.
1.6.1.5. Pro: Humans could live for some periods without eating, due to [autophagy](https://www.dietdoctor.com/renew-body-fasting-autophagy) \(although what is lost would need to be replaced if autophagy goes too far and is detrimental to health\).
1.6.2. Pro: Maybe people could be genetically be designed to be autotrophs instead of heterotrophs. Then getting food from only sunlight and water would be possible \(compared to now\).
1.6.2.1. Pro: Maybe the genetic design could be based on [these animals](http://www.viralnova.com/animals-dont-eat/).
1.6.2.2. Pro: With genetic editing, the genes that code for synthesizing vitamins that are only possible in other animals, such as [Vitamin C](https://blog.livonlabs.com/goat-vitamin-c-production/), could be placed in humans to make them closer to autotrophic than before.
1.6.3. Pro: If people are in suspended animation \(such as for long voyages in space\), then people might survive on little caloric intake.
1.6.4. Con: This is not a realistic possibility for humans, as biologically we need food to survive.
1.6.4.1. Con: As of now, no, but maybe one day in the future it might become a reality.
1.6.5. Con: There are no hypothetical studies to show that not eating would be best for our physical health and well-being.
1.6.6. Pro: The main reason is that agriculture contributes to global warming and depletes natural resources.
1.6.6.1. Con: Maybe we do not need to eat less, but instead make sure our food comes takes little resources. In [Finland](https://futurism.com/a-team-of-scientists-just-made-food-from-electricity-and-it-could-be-the-solution-to-world-hunger/), food is grown using electricity \(from renewable sources\), water, carbon dioxide, and microbes. This is a lot better than most crop and meat production currently.
1.6.7. Pro: If people's minds get digitally uploaded and then downloaded into robotic bodies, then people's food supply could be [electricity instead of food](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g).
1.7. The best diet is a calorie and/or macro based diet where you eat what you want within defined limits like [If It Fits Your Macros.](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/your-complete-guide-to-iifym) \(IIFYM\)
1.7.1. Pro: An IIFYM diet could be good for athletes, who have specific requirements.
1.7.1.1. Pro: It's popular with bodybuilders, who often have very stringent body composition goals.
1.7.2. Con: This diet ignores all effects of micronutrients on health and well being.
1.7.3. Pro: It's a very clear diet with solid guidelines.
1.7.4. Pro: Calorie control has been proven to help with weight control.
1.7.5. Con: It requires a lot of monitoring.
1.7.5.1. Con: Internet tools and smart phones make it more convenient.
1.7.6. Pro: You can mostly eat out on this diet, with a bit of planning.
1.7.7. Pro: You can pretty much eat anything, at least some of the time.
1.7.8. Con: You could eat a diet that's poor in overall nutrition and still meet this plan's requirement.
1.7.9. Pro: It's likely the most precise diet, in terms of measurable parameters.
1.8. The best diet is the Paleo Diet.
1.8.1. Con: The Paleo diet includes inflammatory foods.
1.8.1.1. Pro: [Red meat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25548184) has been shown to be inflammatory and potentially promote cancer progression as a result.
1.8.1.2. Pro: [Lectins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115436/), a carbohydrate binding protein present in many dietary plants such as nuts, have been proven to cause inflammatory diseases such as arthritis.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: Lectins are cooked out so they are not consumed. So, this is not a problem for humans.
1.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: High [lectin](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2017/08/14/reduce-lectins-in-your-diet.aspx) foods can be boiled, slow-cooked, or pressure cooked to reduce the amount of lectin present.
1.8.1.2.2. Pro: [Galectin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2744002/), a form of lectin has been shown to play a role in inflammatory bowel syndrome \(IBS\).
1.8.2. Con: Humans have cultivated fruits and vegetables so much in last 10000 years and especially last 100 years that true Paleolithic fruit and vegetables are nearly impossible to find in supermarkets
1.8.3. Pro: It's normally free from processed foods, which are claimed to be harmful.
1.8.3.1. Con: The Mediterranean diet and whole foods plant-based diet are also free of processed foods.
1.8.3.2. Pro: Like drugs and alcohol, [processed foods](http://www.ns.umich.edu/new/releases/22693-highly-processed-foods-linked-to-addictive-eating) are addictive.
1.8.3.3. Pro: [Processed foods](https://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2015/12/processed-foods-linked-autoimmune-diseases) are linked to autoimmune diseases.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.
1.8.5. Con: The Paleo Diet is pseudoscientific.
1.8.5.1. Pro: We don't really know what paleolithic people ate.
1.8.5.2. Pro: Paleolithic people didn't eat the food that paleo dieters eat.
1.8.5.3. Con: There are peer-reviewed studies in well-respected scientific journals showing [positive health effects](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/5-studies-on-the-paleo-diet#section3) of the Paleo Diet.
1.8.6. Con: The Paleo Diet is very restrictive.
1.8.6.1. Pro: The Paleo diet removes whole foods such as grains, beans, and dairy.
1.9. The best diet is a low carbohydrate diet.
1.9.1. Pro: A low carb diet has proven effective in weight loss trials.
1.9.2. Con: A low carb diet is quite restrictive.
1.9.3. Con: It can be difficult to prepare traditional meals in a low carb style.
1.9.4. Con: Low carb eating has been around for a long time but never has taken off.
1.9.4.1. Con: The [Atkins Diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkins_diet#Popularity) has been a successful and popular low-carb diet for approximately 15 years.
1.9.5. Pro: Health concerns have been expressed about a low carb diet.
1.9.5.1. Pro: Low carb eating has been linked with higher all cause mortality. [journals.plos.org](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055030)
1.9.6. Con: Low carb isn't very convenient for eating out.
1.9.6.1. Con: There are [low carb options](http://lowcarbediem.com/dine-out-low-carbohydrate-list-restaurant-fast-food/) available at most restaurants.
1.9.6.2. Pro: A good social life is important to our wellbeing. Eating out is often a part of this.
1.9.7. Con: Low carb often adheres to the [discredited](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413115003502) insulin-obesity theory. 
[Comment on this evidence by obesity scientist Stephen Guyenet.](http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/a-new-human-trial-seriously-undermines.html)
1.9.7.1. Con: A carbohydrate intake of 140g a day is too high to enter ketogenesis. This cannot be considered a low-carbohydrate diet.
[www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413115003502)
[ketodietapp.com](https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/post/2013/11/21/How-Many-Carbs-per-Day-on-Low-Carb-Ketogenic-Diet) [www.quora.com](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-maximum-carbs-on-ketogenic-diet) 
Because the persons in this study did not reach ketosis, it cannot say something about the fitness of people doing a fasting/ketogenic/low-carb diet.
1.10. The best thing is just to '[Eat food, not too much, mostly plants](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20090323/7-rules-for-eating#1)" .
1.10.1. Con: Plants are inflammatory.
1.10.1.1. Con: There's [evidence](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/84/6/1489.full) to suggest that C-reactive protein \(a bio-marker for inflammation\) is inversely associated for fruit and vegetable consumption.
1.10.1.2. Con: Many plants \(and fruits, beans, etc\) are anti-inflammatory.[www.webmd.com](https://www.webmd.com/diet/anti-inflammatory-diet-road-to-good-health#1)
1.10.1.3. Pro: [Nightshade plants](https://www.livestrong.com/article/431059-nightshade-vegetables-and-arthritis-pain/), such as tomatoes and peppers, contain alkaloids, which can worsen inflammatory conditions.
1.10.2. Pro: This seems fairly sensible.
1.10.2.1. Pro: To 'eat food, not too much, mostly plants.' is a simple guideline that's easy to follow for most people.
1.10.3. Pro: Controlled diets have been linked to eating disorders.
1.10.3.1. Pro: Many of these are [fads](https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/information/body-image/dangers-of-fad-diets) that capitalize on a diet-obsessed culture, creating a cycle of habitual dieting. This cycle then becomes a gateway for eating disorders.
1.10.4. Pro: High plant consumption is recommended by health authorities.
1.10.5. Con: It could be difficult to control weight without clear guidelines.
1.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.10.7. Con: This may not be enough for people with existing conditions.
1.10.7.1. Con: Specialist diets can be made for subsets of the population with an illness.
1.11. It's best just to live for the moment, and enjoy whatever you want. Maybe exercise a bit.
1.11.1. Pro: It's a fun lifestyle.
1.11.2. Pro: You can easily enjoy parties and eat out.
1.11.3. Pro: Eating rich food is satisfying.
1.11.4. Con: We have an epidemic of obesity in the west.
1.11.5. Con: If we don't care of ourselves, for example eat heathy food or something like this, then in time we will be able to do less and less.
1.11.6. Con: Poor dietary choices contribute to disease and can worsen your quality of life.
1.11.7. Pro: It's highly convenient. You never have to worry about eating on the go.
1.11.8. Pro: If you are young you don't have to worry about chronic disease too much. This lifestyle could work well.
1.11.8.1. Con: This is a dangerous way to live, as the very nature of chronic disease means the onset is gradual, with symptoms showing later in life.
1.11.8.1.1. Pro: The early stages of atherosclerosis can [appear](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/72/5/1307s.full) in adolescence.
1.11.8.1.2. Pro: [Insulin resistance](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/89/6/2526/2870283), associated with many chronic diseases, can be prevented early on in childhood.
1.11.8.2. Con: Younger people are not immune to the health risks associated with a bad diet.
1.12. It's best to casually aim for healthy eating, but not really worry about it.
1.12.1. Pro: People have a fairly good idea of what's healthy to eat.
1.12.1.1. Con: Having a good idea what to eat isn't enough to take action. People also need structure to adhere to a beneficial diet.
1.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.10.3.
1.12.3. Con: What is considered health varies globally.
1.12.4. Con: It can be difficult to know what's really healthy to eat.
1.12.4.1. Pro: Food products labeled as 'healthy', often are not.
1.12.4.2. Pro: A survey found that [8 in 10 people find](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/16/health/healthy-foods-confusion-study/index.html) conflicting information when it comes to what is healthy food and what they should avoid.
1.12.4.3. Con: Most people understand you should eat less cakes and more spinach. It's not really a mystery.
1.12.5. Con: In many countries we are not doing very well at eating healthy. We need stronger guidelines.
1.12.5.1. Pro: The US eats more [processed food](http://grist.org/article/americans-eat-more-processed-food-than-well-anyone/) than any other country.
1.12.5.2. Pro: The UK has the [highest obesity rates](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/10/uk-most-obese-country-in-western-europe-oecd-report-finds) in Europe.
1.12.5.3. Pro: Other countries are increasingly adopting a [Western diet](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jun/01/global-food-crisis-changing-diets), leading to more health problems.
1.12.5.4. Con: It isn't the guidelines, but rather the excessive variety of foods made available in unhealthy portions and content that need regulation.
1.13. The best diet is a carnivorous, or zerocarb diet.
1.13.1. Pro: Physiological and evolutionary evidence all point towards human carnivory.
1.13.1.1. Pro: The 1975 book['The Stone Age Diet'](http://www.mitodascalorias.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Voegtlin_1975_The_Stone_Age_Diet.pdf) backs up the ideas that the human species are carnivores.
1.13.1.2. Con: On contrary, human physiology tends in all aspects to be more herbivore than carnivore. We only have two teeth for eating meat and lots to eat plants etc. [www.huffingtonpost.com](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathy-freston/shattering-the-meat-myth_b_214390.html?guccounter=1)
1.13.2. Pro: Humans cannot [digest](http://chemistry.elmhurst.edu/vchembook/547cellulose.html) cellulose and this removes cellulose from the diet.
1.13.3. Pro: A diet that removes carbohydrates allows the body to heal its insulin resistance.
1.13.3.1. Pro: Insulin resistance is a metabolic syndrome that occurs after a human consumes [too many carbohydrates](https://mhunters.com/en/blog/eat-healthy-carbs-insulin-resistance/) over their lifetime, which leads to many chronic diseases.
1.13.3.1.1. Con: [According](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance)to the National Institute of Diabetes, the exact cause of insulin resistance isn't understood but " scientists think the major contributors to insulin resistance are excess weight and physical inactivity."  

There's no solid evidence that insulin resistance is cause by "too many carbohydrates".
1.13.3.2. Con: Removing them altogether is not necessary. Consuming complex carbohydrates with a [lower glycemic index](https://www.nature.com/articles/pr2015142) can improve insulin resistance.
1.13.4. Pro: It is easy to reach your body's desired weight on a diet of just meat.
1.13.4.1. Con: It is also easy to drop and maintain a healthy weight eating many other diets.
1.13.4.1.1. Pro: It is easy to lose and maintain a [healthy weight](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170612094458.htm) on a vegetarian diet.
1.13.4.2. Con: Weight is not the only factor in overall health and well-being. There must be other qualifying factors to a diet.
1.13.5. Con: High meat consumption is shown to increase a person's risk of developing [cancer](http://www.pcrm.org/health/cancer-resources/diet-cancer/facts/meat-consumption-and-cancer-risk).
1.13.5.1. Pro: Increased intake of red meat is shown to result in a 20%-60% elevated risk of [esophagus, liver, and lung cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2121650/).
1.13.5.1.1. Con: This data was gathered using a questionnaire instead of a controlled clinical trial, which is far less reliable and introduces too many confounding variables.
1.13.6. Con: Most people enjoy a variety of foods in their diet. A diet so exceptionally restrictive is unlikely to be satisfying to most people in the medium to long term.
1.13.7. Con: All dietary fiber, which is vital for maintaining the bacteria colonies in our gut, comes from plants. Without these bacteria, or the antioxidants present in plants, health suffers.
1.13.8. Pro: A zero carb diet consists of mostly fatty meat and water, with no plant matter or plant derivatives \(sugar, fiber, starch\).
