Discussion Title: Should Hunger Games-Style Tournaments Be Legal?

1. Consenting adults should be allowed to compete in official, deadly arena-style tournaments, without having to fear any legal repercussions.
1.1. Pro: These games could improve the general cohesiveness of society.
1.1.1. Pro: The tournaments work like a playground for violent society members where they can fulfill their sinister fantasies without legal consequences. As a result these individuals are less threatening for society.
1.1.1.1. Pro: People who repress anger for long periods of time are more apt to "snap," and commit violent acts.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: The catharsis hypothesis - that aggressive behavior reduces anger and aggression - has been consistently proven wrong; [aggressive behavior](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/200909/you-cant-punch-your-way-out-anger) rather leads to more aggressive thoughts and behavior \([Bushman et al., p. 368, 374](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bbushman/bbs99.pdf)\).
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Repressing anger is [linked](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/03/us/health-new-studies-report-health-dangers-of-repressing-emotional-turmoil.html) to negative health outcomes.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Repressing emotions can embed those emotions in the [subconscious](http://www.psychmechanics.com/2014/08/effects-of-suppressing-your-emotions.html), making them more likely to subtly influence behavior.
1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Repressing emotions can make those emotions [stronger](http://www.mysahana.org/2011/05/emotion-suppression-effects-on-mental-and-physical-health/).
1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: When they do commit these violent acts, they are therefore likely to be additionally harmful or done in particularly heinous ways because those emotions have strengthened over a period of time.
1.1.1.2. Pro: It is preferable for these people to satisfy these desires against other consenting individuals in the games, rather than on innocent people on the streets.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: There is no reason to suggest that these people would necessarily perform these actions only within the tournaments. Given that they have already shown a disregard for the law, it is logical to assume that they might continue to do so even if the legal option existed.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: People who have violent tendencies, but have so far controlled them in fear of legal repercussions, would be able to use these games an outlet.
1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: People deserve an outlet for their desires that does not harm society writ large.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: Having the ability to channel these urges would greatly benefit their mental health.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.
1.1.1.2.1.1.3.4. Con: As canvassed in other sections, there is a real risk that participants will suffer mental health consequences as a result of participation, including post-traumatic stress disorder, if they manage to survive the tournament. Therefore, any short-term mental health benefits are neutralised in the long-term.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: While there might not be legal consequences for their actions, there is the distinct possibility \(likelihood\) of them dying in the tournaments. This is probably more of a disincentive to most of these people than legal repercussions and therefore they will not enter.
1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: A member of society who is prone to violence specifically because of the desire to commit an act of extreme violence, is likely to find the idea of participating in the tournament attractive even if there is a risk of dying.
1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: People who are likely to commit acts of extreme violence outside legal boundaries clearly do not have much respect for the sanctity of life and is not even afraid of the harshest legal punishment, which in the United States is the death penalty.
1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Perhaps participating in the tournament could be offered as an alternative choice for those condemned to death.
1.1.1.3. Con: There is a [startlingly](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/boxing-violence-follows-fighters-when-they-leave-the-ring-1766174.html) [high](http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/7/22/9014377/hbo-segment-domestic-violence-ufc-mma-christy-mack-war-machine-thiago-silva-travis-browne) rate of personal violence in the lives of those involved in sports like boxing, suggesting that rules that constrain the violence in their activity may not stop it influencing their personal actions, or those of their fans.
1.1.1.4. Con: The tournaments would elevate these destructive and dangerous individuals from outlaws to influential stars; they could then become role models in a negative way.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: We would not want role models who encourage violence in society. This will cause more people to lead a violent lifestyle.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: This is particularly harmful as not everyone who wants to compete will necessarily be able to. Thus some of these people will take their violence out on regular people on the streets.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: In particular, children are looking for heroes or role models to look up to, both in the real world and increasingly in the mediated world. As they are in the process of developing their own identities, adolescents are likely to look for role models with whom they can identify \([Konijn, Bijvank, Bushman, p. 2](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bbushman/KNB07.pdf)\).
1.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Adolescent boys who identify with violent characters in video games tend to perform more violent behavior. Same tendencies are probable in the case of identification with "tournament heroes" \([Konjin, Bijvank, Bushman, p.1](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bbushman/KNB07.pdf)\).
1.1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Male adolescents with lower educational ability may be especially vulnerable to identification with violent heroes \([Konjin, Bijvank, Bushman, p. 3](http://Male adolescents with lower educational ability may be especially vulnerable)\).
1.1.1.4.2.3. Con: If there is an age-restriction system in place for going to the cinema, far more stringent admission rules would be put in place for something this severe.
1.1.1.4.2.3.1. Con: This assumes that those restrictions are effective. In the digital age, these are very difficult to enforce.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: If society already finds extreme violence unacceptable, it is unlikely that society would ever start considering successful killers to be stars or role models.
1.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: There is an enormous amount of film and television which is dedicated to murder and violence more generally. There is no reason why this genre should be acceptable if we condemn a live version of it.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1. Con: However there is a striking difference between fictional murder/ violence and real ones.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: News of "real" crime and murder provokes consternation, whereas fictional violence is consumed for entertaining and recreational purposes.
1.1.1.5. Con: Just because someone wants to fulfil a particular desire does not mean that society has a responsibility to enable that. Some desires are just wrong and should be curtailed by the government.
1.1.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.1.7. Pro: It might be preferable if these kinds of people die before they end up committing an act of extreme violence outside of legal boundaries. This is likely to happen since continued participation is almost certain to result in their death.
1.1.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.2.1.
1.1.1.8. Con: [Research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/200909/you-cant-punch-your-way-out-anger) shows that using violence as an outlet only propagates those violent urges.
1.1.2. Pro: Disadvantaged groups can make use of these tournaments to improve their social status \(similar to how the fictional Hunger Games represent female empowerment\).
1.1.2.1. Con: The success of outstanding individuals from disadvantaged groups, be it a female or a black competitor, might distract public attention from the systems of injustice that affect those without prominent success stories.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: This allows people to assume that if one person from a disadvantaged group can excel, then all can. This disregards the myriad structural barriers which face certain members of those groups more than others.
1.1.2.2. Con: The success of outstanding individuals from disadvantaged groups can send the wrong message: that success in an area where few succeed is a superior goal to more traditional and egalitarian career paths.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: The American media [has created](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ658517) "blind faith of black youths and families in sports as a vehicle for self-realization and socioeconomic advancement" - which is reinforced by the relative lack of black role models in other areas.
1.1.2.3. Con: The success of individuals from disadvantaged groups in deadly tournaments might also promote stereotypes about these groups that further disadvantage them, for example the notion that black individuals are prone to violence.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: This is especially problematic given that a lot of people have entrenched biases due to fear of people who are different to them. Playing to these fears can drastically hurt the cause of these minorities.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Watching people of other races fight to survive will allow for ["stereotype replacement"](http://schd.ws/hosted_files/ula2016/fc/Nine%20%20Strategies%20for%20Overcoming%20Implicit%20Bias%20update.pdf) where seeing people of other races achieve great things reduces subconscious racial bias against those groups \(see [Gladwell, p. 97](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=VKGbb1hg8JAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gladwell+blink&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Implicit%20Association%20Test%22&f=false)\).
1.1.2.5. Con: This could also have the opposite effect; if disadvantaged groups were not successful, it would support some people's prejudice that they were somehow inferior.
1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Given the significant structural barriers that already exist in most other areas of society \(such as education and employability\), it does not seem any more likely that these groups will succeed in these tournaments than elsewhere in society.
1.1.2.5.1.1. Con: The argument does not presume that they would excel \(or not\), rather that they would participate at disproportionate rates.
1.1.2.5.1.2. Con: In these kinds of tournaments, desperation and desire would often be determining factors, not educational background.
1.1.2.5.1.3. Pro: In order to be successful in these tournaments, one probably needs access to good training over a period of time prior to the games. Poverty and disadvantage are likely to preclude access to these opportunities, making success less likely.
1.1.2.5.1.3.1. Con: Given that wealthy children are unlikely to participate in these tournaments, forming training schools \(like, say, the US youth gymnastics program\) seems unprofitable and thus unlikely.
1.1.2.5.1.3.2. Con: Knowing that participation in the games is wholly voluntary, kids can start training earlier knowing they will be able to participate.
1.1.2.5.1.3.2.1. Con: It is problematic to send the message that in order to succeed they need to begin training at young ages. This makes it difficult to move to other sectors in later life if they decide they no longer want to participate.
1.1.2.6. Con: This simply amplifies the extent to which the impoverished and desperate are likely to feel that this is the only option available to them to provide for their families or own survival.
1.1.2.6.1. Pro: While money can be an effective form of short term relief for people in poverty, education is the most effective way for disadvantaged groups to improve their [futures](http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bpc4) and break the cycle of poverty.
1.1.3. Con: Violent sports riots already [cause huge amounts of damage and injury](http://www.therichest.com/sports/10-of-the-most-costly-sports-riots-in-history/). The riots of hunger games fans could be even more deadly given the violence encouraged by the tournament itself.
1.1.3.1. Con: The worst riots \(both based on original reference and the [deadliest](http://www.thesportster.com/entertainment/top-15-deadliest-sports-riots-of-all-time/) riots\) tend to be in sports which are non-violent such as basketball and soccer, suggesting that violent sports are not necessarily coupled with violent rioting.
1.1.4. Con: [Social polarization is already at an all time high](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/upshot/polarization-is-dividing-american-society-not-just-politics.html); split along political, demographic, regional, and class lines. Pro/Anti Games positions would further polarise, as would disputes between different Games fandoms.
1.1.4.1. Con: This could also work in the other direction with different cross-sections of society banding together to support their favourite competitor.
1.1.4.2. Con: Social polarization at a high is demonstrated by civil war not FOX news VS. CNN.
1.1.5. Pro: The tournaments provide illustrations of how ethical and moral decisions play out at an individual level.
1.1.5.1. Con: It is problematic if people need illustrations of these decisions in this kind of environment. If people use these kinds of tournaments to understand morality, it is likely to be warped by the violence on display.
1.1.6. Con: The tournaments could intensify racial conflicts, e.g. when many white people try to eliminate one black person.
1.1.7. Con: This could outcast the victors as they could be perceived as murderers by those who oppose the hunger games tournaments. There would also be conflict between those who want to participate in the tournament, but aren't selected with the government who runs it.
1.2. Pro: These tournaments would make for great entertainment.
1.2.1. Pro: These games would combine the fascination of violent behavior with the third person reality of shows like Big Brother. This makes them highly attractive and entertaining.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Violence and cruelty permeates and has become a vital competent of our culture, as can be seen in Jekyll and Hyde or the werewolf myth. This makes on-screen violence interesting to watch as it reflects a specific part of everyday culture.
1.2.1.2. Con: Violence and cruelty is immoral, harmful and put lives at risk.
1.2.2. Pro: People enjoy watching violence because they associate and identify with the violence on screen; it represents a deep-seated primal urge we all have to commit violence that is only held back by society.
1.2.2.1. Con: The problem with viewing this form of violence is that it is real individuals participating, meaning watching it may encourage others to give into their urge to commit violence after seeing society condone it in this way.
1.2.3. Pro: Violent entertainment is widely consumed. These tournaments would just add to this form of entertainment.
1.2.3.1. Pro: War toys and violent video games are commonplace.
1.2.3.2. Con: While violent entertainment is widely consumed and accepted, explicitly deadly entertainment is not.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.3.1.
1.2.4. Pro: Storytelling is a [key feature of all human societies](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/11/the-psychological-comforts-of-storytelling/381964/), and tales of warriors achieving against all odds are a recurring feature in popular fiction. These tournaments would be even more popular for telling the same story with real people.
1.2.5. Con: Certain people find violent real snuff films entertaining. We should not make social decisions based on what some people find amusing.
1.2.5.1. Con: Overall, social decisions should increase the level of happiness of the society. Thus, what people find amusing is a central component.
1.2.6. Con: The fact that people so enjoy watching their fellow humans in mortal danger is not a good thing for society.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Enjoying mortal danger makes death into something that you consume for fun, which creates a lack of respect for the sanctity of life.
1.2.6.1.1. Pro: By consuming death for fun, you are attaching importance and value to death, which can be dangerous to society.
1.2.6.1.1.1. Con: This is not always bad. Some societies view death, in certain scenarios, as preferable to living. e.g. Honor-based suicide, martyrdom.
1.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.6.3. Pro: [Research](http://www.apa.org/action/resources/research-in-action/protect.aspx) has shown that watching media violence creates more violent behaviors in people.
1.2.6.4. Pro: This form of entertainment would foil the humanistic idea of the [dignity of man](https://www.britannica.com/topic/humanism), as it debases human life.
1.2.6.4.1. Con: Actually humanism \([humanitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitas)\) has its beginning in the Roman Republic - a society in which deadly tournaments were something totally normal.
1.2.6.4.2. Pro: [Human dignity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity) means that individuals have an innate right to be valued, respected, and to receive ethical treatment. Without dignity humans become objects.
1.2.6.5. Con: People do not only watch these tournaments for the violence. They also watch for the thrill of competition and for people pushing the limits of the human body.
1.2.7. Con: This form of entertainment would be a very disturbing experience. There is a huge potential for further consequences like the generation of mental health issues.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Witnessing an act of violence can cause [psychological trauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma#Assessment).
1.2.7.2. Pro: Especially children who are [exposed to violence](http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/July-2016/Children-Witness-Violence-Trauma-Counseling/) are at risk for mental and behavioral issues.
1.2.7.3. Pro: [Violent media exposure](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/19/violent-media-anxiety_n_6671732.html) can exacerbate or contribute to the development of stress, anxiety, depression and even post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\).
1.2.8. Con: Normalizing conflict and violence between people for the sake of mere entertainment on such a level should not be encouraged.
1.2.8.1. Con: Humans are a violent species by nature. This will find an outlet, either regulated or unregulated.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: Violence naturally occurs in societies, as a consequence of anger, passion, premeditated thinking and other human reasons. Making Tournaments legal would at least provide some tax revenues for the rest of the country to benefit, it would also help to control and decide where and when the violent behavior occurs.
1.2.9. Pro: Games like these provided a useful function for our ancestors in Rome and our brains haven't changed that much.
1.3. Pro: The right to compete in these tournaments is a natural extension of the way that society currently promotes freedom.
1.3.1. Pro: The right to bodily autonomy gives individuals a right to consent to harm, or even death.
1.3.1.1. Pro: This is not a right that the government can or should restrict, unless it harms others who do not consent to be harmed.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Consent to government authority in a social contract is about an agreement to abide by norms and rules that protect society, not the individual. Where this is undermined through the promotion of violence, the government has a right to restrict it.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: The government derives its authority over its citizens from a [social contract](https://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/class/120/8-political.htm) - an agreement to be governed and restricted such as is necessary to prevent harm to each other.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The social [contract theory](https://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/class/120/8-political.htm) of governance only grants to government the authority to stop behavior that causes harm to people who do not consent to it.
1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: The promotion of violence does not undermine the norms and rules that protect society. Our agreement not to limit the behavior of consenting adults who do not harm others is what protects society.
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: We value freedom of choice because it is impossible for a government to understand the impact that a choice will have on an individual's life. The only person who can assess those outcomes is the individual.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: The freedom of choice is one of many rights that we have that exist in relation to our responsibilities to be productive and law-abiding citizens. This is why the state can to some extent, claim a right to assess the impact that a choice will have on an individual's life.
1.3.1.2. Con: We regulate what people are allowed to do all of the time in the name of public safety or personal interest \(e.g. drinking age, medicine regulation\).
1.3.1.2.1. Con: However, this is not a matter of public safety, as participants are freely consenting.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Promoting violence is bad for society generally.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Allowing these tournaments, as well as watching them, would promote violence.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Humans can very well separate between entertainment and real world violence. Violent PC games, for example, do not lead to more violence even though humans enjoy it.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: A meta-analytical [study](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/12/5/353.abstract) came to the conclusion that children who play more violent video games are more likely to have increased aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: These findings were confirmed by another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20192553) focusing on violent video games exclusively.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Several [studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_controversies#cite_note-23) show that there is no direct link between violent video games and real world violence.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Games can [confuse](http://metro.co.uk/2011/09/20/nottingham-trent-university-researchers-gamers-cant-tell-real-world-from-fantasy-164943/) reality and fantasy and therefore prevent a clear separation of the fictional and real world.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The sample is not representative of gamers as the people were selected on the basis of being aged between 15 and 21, and played only ten hours of games a week.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Cruel video game behavior increases players’ [moral sensitivity](http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2014/06/037.html) in real life.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.5. Con: Many [perpetrators](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2013/09/12/training-simulation-mass-killers-often-share-obsession-with-violent-video-games.html) of mass shootings played violent video games.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: This is correlation not causation. There are many perpetrators who don't play violent video games and many people who play violent video games who don't commit mass shootings.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.6. Con: Violent video games [desensitize](https://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/abstracts/2005-2009/07cab.pdf) players to real-life violence.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.7. Con: Video games that portray violence against [women](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22550147) lead to more harmful attitudes and sexually violent actions towards women.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.8. Con: The [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/violent-video-games.pdf) lists violent video games as a risk factor for aggressive behavior.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.9. Pro: The US Supreme Court [ruled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Entertainment_Merchants_Ass%27n) that violent video games do not cause youth to act aggressively other than for example the story of Hansel and Gretel.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.10. Pro: Millions of people play violent video games but only a small fraction of the consumers become violent.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.11. Pro: Violent video games allow players to release their stress and anger in the game, leading to less real world aggression. For example, 69% of male gamers reported that it relieves stress \([Olson et al, p. 82](http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X\(07\)00027-4/pdf)\).
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.11.1. Pro: Gun violence is less prevalent in countries with high video game use, such as the [Netherlands](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2012/12/17/ten-country-comparison-suggests-theres-little-or-no-link-between-video-games-and-gun-murders/).
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.11.1.1. Con: The supposed correlation established by the author of the article is highly flawed. Countries like the Netherlands and South Korea have a variety of variables that interfere with the correlation between their high video game usage and very low gun violence, first and foremost the very low availability of guns in both countries.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.11.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.11.3. Pro: Playing violent games is not necessarily a violent activity itself. Focusing on a game might allow players to let off steam by distracting themselves from other sources of stress.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.12. Pro: Violent video games may decrease crime because people are busy playing the games instead of committing violent acts.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.12.1. Con: Based on [a study](http://www.theaveragegamer.com/averagegamers/) the average gamer spends five days a week, for 2 hours and 32 minutes on gaming. As a result, there is plenty of time left to commit violent acts.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.1.13. Pro: Despite ready availability of violent PC games the [juvenile arrest rate](http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/JAR_Display.asp?ID=qa05201) is at an historic low. This indicates that youths have become less criminal.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Media violence has a stronger effect on real‐life aggression when it is [realistically](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/dev-392201.pdf) depicted. As these tournaments would represent the most realistic form, the real-life aggression effects would be greatest.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: This violence is likely to be less realistic as it is a highly-staged and artificial environment. On the other hand, murder mysteries and news are likely to be more realistic as they are inherently relatable.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: In the same way that murder mysteries are relatable because they can involve every day people, these tournaments may be seen as relatable not because of their setting but because of who is involved.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: These competitions would be seen as particularly realistic as people may know individuals competing in them, or have some connection to the people they are seeing murder or be killed.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4. Con: Citizens are regularly exposed to violence through their own communities, other sports and the media. Introducing these contests is therefore unlikely to have much impact on an individual's view towards violence when these other influences are still present.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Just because violent imagery exists in the status quo does not mean we have to add to it.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: While this is true, it makes no attempt to quantify the relative effect of those influences. Given that the average [American child](http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/tv.htm) will see 200,000 violent acts and 16,000 murders on TV by age 18, this additional influence will not be of significant impact.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: Desensitizing people to violence makes them [more likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4539292/) to commit it, especially in adolescents.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.6. Pro: Violence makes people less safe.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: Without life, you cannot access the benefits of any other rights. Therefore, the right to life is the basis on which all other rights are built upon.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Given that society has successfully developed despite the natural presence of violence, the promotion of violence seems not to be inherently bad.
1.3.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: The entire history of society could be considered as a lineage of evolving institutions and norms to prevent wanton violence  such as through the rule of law, the exchange of currency, the police, etc.
1.3.1.2.1.1.3. Con: Society is nothing more than the agglomeration of the preferences of its members. Therefore, what is "good for society" is nothing more than what people want. Given that many members of society have violent tendencies, what society wants may very well be violence.
1.3.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Even if individuals want to commit violence, that desire is probably outweighed by the desire to not be subjected to violence. In a more violent society, the likelihood of being subjected to violence would increase, therefore people probably do not want a more violent society.
1.3.1.2.1.1.3.2. Con: The portion of society that commits violent crimes is significantly lower than 50% \([source](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/violent-crime/violent-crime-topic-page/violentcrimemain_final) suggests approximately 0.35%\). Following the premise of the parent, this suggests society doesn't want violence.
1.3.1.2.1.1.3.3. Con: Even if a majority did want violence, this is not necessarily a reason to do it. One of the main roles of the government is to ensure that minorities are protected against tyranny of the majority if that outcome is particularly bad for the minority.
1.3.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Given the strong focus on elimination of violent crimes including domestic violence, it is counterproductive to support a tournament which glorifies the same motivators.
1.3.1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: Violent sports have been linked with increased rates of domestic violence, with rates of domestic violence suspected to be [much higher among Mixed Martial Arts competitors](http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2015/7/22/9014377/hbo-segment-domestic-violence-ufc-mma-christy-mack-war-machine-thiago-silva-travis-browne), and studies showing domestic violence rates can spike as a [reaction to sporting events.](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/10/study-domestic-violence-increases-after-major-sporting-events/263570/)
1.3.1.2.1.1.4.2. Con: The highly orchestrated and visible nature of the tournament could be used to highlight the need to consent to violence. This could play out similarly affirmative consent standards, or the use of pre/post-roll affirmations in BDSM pornography.
1.3.1.2.1.1.4.2.1. Con: This assumes that the average person watching the sports understands the nuance of an individual consenting to violence. It is more likely that they will see lots of violence being condoned and act upon it themselves.
1.3.1.2.1.1.5. Pro: The purpose of government is to promote stability and safety in society.
1.3.1.2.1.1.5.1. Con: The tournaments would not be a threat to general stability and safety of the country as long as they were held in special areas and not in public.
1.3.1.2.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.3.
1.3.1.2.1.2. Con: People are freely consenting when they choose to buy cigarettes too. When governments regulate public safety, they do so with the premise of preventing people from consenting into dangerous behaviors.
1.3.1.3. Pro: The right to bodily autonomy sets out the notion that an individual should have total control over what is done to their body. In the same way that we allow people to perform other actions that harm their bodies \(such as smoking\), we should allow this.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Bodily autonomy is both a positive and a negative right. That is to say that not only does it mean that a person cannot be forced to do something to their body but that they can choose to do anything they want to it as well.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: While smoking is legal in principle, it has been outlawed in public buildings and restaurants; in some areas smoking in parks is not allowed either. Furthermore, printing images of the effects of smoking on packages serves to discourage the habit. While not outlawed yet, one could argue that these measures show that this habit is becoming unacceptable.
1.3.1.4. Pro: There is no principled reason why bodily autonomy should exclude allowing someone else to harm you. This is a form of transaction between consenting parties.
1.3.1.4.1. Pro: We already permit individuals to elect to have someone else invade their body \(for instance in surgery\). Our conception of bodily autonomy does not preclude a second party under the status quo.
1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: Surgery is done for the benefit of the individual. That is to say, we allow people to consent to violations of their bodily autonomy when it is in their benefit, not when it will almost certainly lead to death.
1.3.1.4.1.1.1. Con: This is not a violation of an individual's bodily autonomy, this is in fact a reflection of it. The whole concept of bodily autonomy is that the government should not make judgements on whether an outcome of your actions harms your body because you have the right to make that choice yourself.
1.3.1.5. Con: It is difficult to ascertain proper consent to compete in these games.
1.3.1.5.1. Pro: Consent is not a binary. Where there is a greater risk involved \(in this case, death\), we expect a higher level of understanding on behalf of the individual for the consent to be legitimate.
1.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: It is very rarely possible to understand every outcome of an action. As a result, it is a fallacy to view consent as either being present or not. Instead, one needs to consider whether an individual's level of understanding reaches a certain threshold for the activity in question.
1.3.1.5.1.2. Con: It is quite patronizing of a state to declare an individual incapable of consenting if that individual has been cleared by professional psychologists and given their own explicit consent. It is unreasonable to assume that the state would be better at assessing whether or not an individual can freely consent.
1.3.1.5.2. Pro: In order to survive in these games, it is necessary to resort to increasingly depraved behaviour as the competition becomes increasingly difficult. Even if a competitor can consent to the initial games, it becomes harder for them to continually evaluate the games as they progress.
1.3.1.5.2.1. Con: While they are unable to give continual consent as the game progresses, they know the types of choices they will have to make in order to win.
1.3.1.5.2.1.1. Con: Given that the games would need to be different each time to attract an audience \(which is presumably their purpose, as with all sport\), it is inherently impossible for an individual entering the games to properly understand and consent to what is likely to happen to them.
1.3.1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: While the specific aspects might be different, the general conceit \(violence, murder, risk of death\) remains constant, and thus people can consent into the principles without knowing the details of how those principles will be applied.
1.3.1.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: That standard is not the one we generally apply in society; it is a requirement that people understand the practical impact of what they are consenting to. For example, sexual consent is not simply a matter of consenting to the general principles, we expect that an individual should be able to know how those principles manifest before consent is attained.
1.3.1.5.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In the case of these competitions, people will know what acts they will have to commit \(e.g. murder, violence\), just not the specific contexts of them. Similarly, sexual consent can, and often does, take the form of agreeing, in advance, to certain acts.
1.3.1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Ultimately, participants will need to kill in order to win the games. If they are willing to consent to this, it is fair to assume that they understand what they will face in the games.
1.3.1.5.3. Con: Knowing the consequences of a game of life and death does not require special education.
1.3.1.5.3.1. Con: While this is true, it is naïve to think that life and death are the only potential consequences of these games. As elucidated elsewhere, even those who survive these games can be subject to significant long term harm such as PTSD which is very difficult to comprehend until confronted with it.
1.3.1.5.4. Con: People know what the potential consequences of participating are and therefore know full well what they are consenting to.
1.3.1.5.5. Con: All people in society should be treated equally. People living in poverty should not be paternalized, that is, society should not 'coddle' them, or assume they have less agency.
1.3.1.5.5.1. Pro: As these tournaments would be open to everyone equally, they do not disproportionally impact a particular socio-economic group.
1.3.1.5.5.2. Pro: Legalizing these kinds of tournaments would allow people more choices. Giving more choices to people is the opposite of paternalization.
1.3.1.5.5.3. Con: While this is true, it is still necessary to acknowledge that when large sums of money are offered as a prize, those that have few resources are more likely to feel as they should compete based on a level of desperation.
1.3.1.5.5.4. Con: Society already makes a tacit recognition that paternalism is acceptable, by giving forms of targeted welfare such as [food stamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program). However, on the whole, it is still a good thing for the government to do this for their protection.
1.3.1.5.6. Pro: True consent is that which can be removed at any point if someone no longer wants to agree to participate in an act. It may not be easy or possible to remove consent to participate in these tournaments once they are under way.
1.3.1.5.6.1. Pro: One example of this is providing sexual consent. This can be removed at any point if one person no longer feels comfortable participating in an act.
1.3.1.5.6.2. Pro: We would not allow people to consent to becoming a slave as it would be denying future choices.
1.3.1.5.6.3. Con: In many instances consent can be binding of future actions, such as in contract law or military desertion.
1.3.1.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.5.2.1.1.
1.3.1.6. Pro: Citizens are freely allowed to partake in motorsports which are responsible for many injuries and deaths among the [drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_deaths_in_motorsport).
1.3.1.7. Con: As with all rights that we have, they are contingent on that right not conflicting with a separate right of a different individual. When the right to bodily autonomy harms another individual's right to life, then we can absolutely curtail it.
1.3.1.7.1. Con: However, many legal systems allow exceptions e.g. self-defense.
1.3.1.8. Pro: A number of European countries and some US states have [legalised euthanasia or assisted dying](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-34445715). This increasingly accepted policy recognises the extension of bodily autonomy to include the right to consent to dying.
1.3.1.8.1. Pro: According to [surveys](http://www.gallup.com/poll/183425/support-doctor-assisted-suicide.aspx), about seven out of ten Americans support euthanasia \(even when the survey question includes a reference to suicide\).
1.3.2. Pro: Individuals are best placed to assess their own wants, needs, desires, priorities and capacities.
1.3.2.1. Con: If it was true that individuals are always best placed to assess their own needs, then no one would ever do anything that they would later regret. Issues such as addiction or debts arising from risky behavior like excessive gambling wouldn't exist.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: This is a false paradigm. The question is not whether individuals always make the right decision but whether they make better decisions than the government would. It is highly likely that if the government made decisions on an individual's behalf, then they might also regret the outcome.
1.3.2.2. Con: Eventually some's desires spills over onto someone else.  One example is smoking  - eventually laws were created to keep the desires of some spilling over onto others.  Other example abound.  To live together in peace requires that we give up some freedom.  Striking the right balance is difficult--it can end in war.
1.3.2.3. Pro: The fact that individuals' desires may differ from that of the government or a hypothetical rational actor does not mean those desires are invalid or can rightfully be dismissed or constrained by a government.
1.3.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.3.2.3.2. Con: The government makes judgments about the validity of people's decisions all the time. Seatbelt laws, for example, are a case of the government deciding what is best for people, even though it doesn't affect broader society.
1.3.2.4. Con: People make bad or irrational decisions all the time. It is in society's interest writ large to minimize these.
1.3.2.5. Con: Individuals have subconscious heuristics and biases that prevent optimal outcomes \(e.g. decision inertia prevents people from 'checking boxes,' which leads to fewer people opting-in to [beneficial systems](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/business/economy/27view.html)\). It is the role of society to counteract these heuristics into societally optimal outcomes.
1.3.2.5.1. Con: This principle could be used to justify the government making all decisions for all citizens because they could get 'optimal outcomes.' However we don't accept this because we also value individual liberty.
1.3.2.5.1.1. Pro: An important aspect of individual liberty is the ability to make bad choices, even when others disapprove.
1.3.3. Pro: Both boxing and American football are violent sports. Letting death and bodily harm happen in real time will continue a long tradition of violent games we seem to enjoy.
1.3.3.1. Con: Just because humankind can look back on a long history of violent games does not make them good or desirable. As humankind is on a constant path of progress \([Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment)\) these violent games ought be regarded as a relic of the past and overcome.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: There does not seem to be evidence that society wants to overcome such violent games, given the continued popularity among participants and viewers of sports such as football.
1.3.3.2. Pro: We allow people to willingly consent to dangerous activities, even those that might cause post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\), especially with the promise of generous compensation.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: We let people consent to joining the military.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Military service has broad societal benefits, whereas these tournaments do not.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: We allow people to consent to recreational activities with a high risk of accident or injury, for example, skydiving.
1.3.3.2.3. Pro: We allow people to work in professions with high emotional tolls, including social work and police work that have high rates of PTSD.
1.3.3.2.3.1. Con: As with military service, this work brings about societal benefits that do not accrue from participation in these tournaments.
1.3.3.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.2.3.2.
1.3.3.2.5. Con: There is something unique about allowing people to sign up to something where by far the most likely outcome is death. That means we should question their ability to consent.
1.3.3.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.5.1.2.
1.3.3.2.6. Pro: We allow people to opt in to the testing of drugs despite not knowing all the effects of the drug. An individual consents to do this because they receive payment for their services.
1.3.3.2.6.1. Con: Drug testing is different because there are significant societal benefits attached to the testing, such as the possibility for the drug companies to find a cure for a disease or significantly reduce the effect of an illness for a large group of people.
1.3.3.3. Con: While these sports are violent, they very, very rarely result in death.
1.3.3.3.1. Con: Both sports in the above argument have [high](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/410861) [rates](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/american-football/2016/04/11/american-football-study-finds-evidence-of-brain-injury-in-living/) of traumatic brain injury, which can severely impair the quality of life for participants and result in early death. It is not clear that immediate death is necessarily a worse consequence than the drawn-out suffering and decline that these injuries can cause.
1.3.3.3.1.1. Con: Death is a significantly greater consequence and harm than the kind of injuries common to these sports.
1.3.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Even though the effects of a traumatic brain injury should not be underestimated, they do at least allow the individual to continue to live some sort of life. Even if that life is significantly diminished from what they previously had, it is still considerably better than being dead.
1.3.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Some people might consider living with severely diminished mental faculties to be worse than death.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: Death is irreversible, removing the ability for people to make any further choices about their lives. In this way it is more significant than other injuries.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Traumatic brain injury - which is the comparison which is being considered - is also irreversible and removes ability for people to make choices.
1.3.3.3.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Even if it does not remove all their ability to make choices, it changes the sort of choices they are capable of making. This is also a significant harm.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: When death occurs in these sports it is accidental.
1.3.3.4. Pro: Many people find joy in extreme sports because the threat of death makes them feel more alive. They are commonly called "[adrenaline junkies](http://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/body-mind-spirit/addiction/what-makes-an-adrenaline-junkie/)."
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: Base Jumping, for example, has been [described as](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/magazine/its-more-like-a-suicide-than-a-sport.html?pagewanted=all) "More Like a Suicide Than a Sport".
1.3.3.4.2. Con: The thrill people get from coming close to death is not necessarily a good justification for allowing people to sign up for a tournament that has an overwhelming possibility of resulting in death.
1.3.3.5. Pro: To the extent that we allow people to play sports knowing that there exists a distinct possibility of serious permanent injury, there is no reason that the proposed games should be banned. After all, death is just a natural extension of serious injury and is thus principally consistent.
1.3.3.5.1. Con: Death is in no way principally consistent with serious injury, if only for the simple reason that you cannot recover from death.
1.3.3.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.1.1.1.
1.3.3.6. Con: Although these sports do involve violence, the purpose of them is not to inflict permanent injury or death upon another party. Unlike with these sports, the core idea of the proposed games is to cause serious injury and death. As a result, the analogy does not stand.
1.3.4. Con: It is problematic of governments to suggest that it is possible to consent to have violence enacted upon you.
1.3.4.1. Pro: At the point at which the government tacitly concedes that it is possible to consent to violence, it makes it harder to prosecute other forms of violence in society because it adds an additional need for the prosecution to prove that the victim was not consenting.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: This assumes that the view towards violence which is promulgated by these games is accepted elsewhere in society. However, there is no reason for the government to allow this more broadly.
1.3.4.1.1.1. Con: To the extent that popular TV affects norms in society, it is likely that people would see these games and then think that some of those behaviours were acceptable.
1.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: This is no different to other violent sports such as boxing or rugby; while it is acceptable to assault people within the sport, it does not mean it is acceptable to do so outside of the arena.
1.3.4.2. Con: It is problematic to suggest the government suggests you cannot consent to have violence enacted upon you. Martial arts tournament, BDSM etc. exist between consenting adults who decide what happens to them. The government has no say in this.
1.3.5. Pro: The individual's freedom should only be limited where it affects the freedom of other individuals. As this is not the case here, the tournaments should be legal.
1.3.6. Con: There are many examples where the government restricts freedom in a way that is not consistent with other laws in society. Just because it is a 'natural extension' to do this, does not mean we necessarily should.
1.3.6.1. Pro: The government allows us to consent to harms all the time yet does not allow us to drive without wearing seatbelts. This is a contradiction of freedoms but is made in the general public interest.
1.3.7. Con: This argument is ad absurdum. It proposes that a free society will at some point be subject to gladiatorial or running man style entertainment.
1.4. Con: The government should never permit actions which cannot be consented to and are antithetical to accepted societal values.
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.5.
1.4.2. Pro: These tournaments are incompatible with the values of modern society.
1.4.2.1. Pro: These tournaments would erode the value of human life.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.
1.4.2.1.2. Con: The capacity to freely act on our will is integral to the formation and expression of individual identity, and thus is central to the human condition. Therefore, increasing choice improves the human condition, which increases the value of each individual life.
1.4.2.1.2.1. Con: This logic could also be used to condone non-consensual homicide as increasing the value of human life. However, it is still considered be unacceptable because the physical loss of life overrides this ethereal concept of value.
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: Insofar as acting on violent urges increases an individual's future propensity for violence, more violence means people violate others' right to bodily autonomy more often, which means people value other people's lives less.
1.4.2.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.2.1.4. Pro: This desensitizes us to taboos around killing others and normalizes murder.
1.4.2.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.4.2.1.4.2. Con: An average [American child](http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/tv.htm) will already see 200,000 violent acts and 16,000 murders on TV by age 18. If this does not desensitize them then nothing will.
1.4.2.1.4.3. Con: There is [some argument](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/apr/14/boxingisthebestwaytostop) that rather than normalising violence, violent sports instead give a safe outlet for aggression and teach those involved the consequences of actions.
1.4.2.1.4.3.1. Con: This analysis is done in the context of boxing. These games are significantly different because the vast majority of competitors die. It can in no way be said to be a 'safe outlet'.
1.4.2.1.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.2.1.4.4. Con: It does not normalize murder in any normal sense. In fact, it emphasizes the difference between normal life and these tournaments.
1.4.2.1.4.5. Con: Consensual homicide in itself is not outright problematic. In the form of euthanasia it is legal in [countries like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_euthanasia) Belgium and the Netherlands and receives wide-ranging public support, for example [in the United States](http://www.gallup.com/poll/171704/seven-americans-back-euthanasia.aspx).
1.4.2.1.4.5.1. Con: The issue with such tournaments is less the normalisation of death itself, and more the normalisation of violent death, which is much more likely to normalise non-consensual homicide.
1.4.2.1.4.5.1.1. Con: There is no necessary connection between a violent death and it being non-consensual. In these tournaments it would be clear \(and could be additionally emphasized\) that participants participate of their own accord.
1.4.2.1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.4.2.1.5. Pro: Human life should be considered sacrosanct whether or not participants are consenting.
1.4.2.1.6. Con: Alternatively, it could create a norm that violence is unacceptable outside of very specific circumstances, e.g. these tournaments.
1.4.2.1.6.1. Pro: These tournaments could be used to channel violence in society into a controllable space, by creating a path of least resistance for those with violent urges to act on those in a space the government can control.
1.4.2.1.6.2. Con: While this is theoretically possible, it is important to consider the likelihood of the competing outcomes. In a world where violence is already a norm to some extent, it is more credible that the presence of these tournaments would fuel that violence rather than condemn it.
1.4.2.2. Pro: The USA is predominately a Christian nation. These tournaments are opposed to Christian values and violate the [commandment](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20%3A1-17) "You shall not murder".
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Pretty much all the commandments are routinely violated by even by nominal Christians, such as not working on the Sabbath, misusing the Lord's name, and coveting stuff.
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: [70.6% of the American population identified themselves as Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States)  which makes Christian values a good approximation for societal values.
1.4.2.2.3. Con: In the United States, government operates under the principle of a separation of Church and State. Therefore, an argument that appeals to religion in terms of shaping policy is moot.
1.4.2.2.4. Pro: [Many people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/25/republicans-christian-america_n_6754032.html) in the US believe that the country ought be governed by Christian principles.
1.4.2.2.4.1. Con: Many people believing that the country should be governed by Christian principles does not mean that this is the correct approach, particularly if it results in limiting others' rights.
1.4.2.2.4.2. Con: [More than half](http://www.prri.org/spotlight/is-america-a-christian-nation-nearly-half-of-americans-no-longer-think-so/) of the country does not support the notion that the US is a Christian nation.
1.4.2.3. Pro: Insofar as the USA does not permit consensual euthanasia, there is a clear societal preference for preserving life over individual autonomy to choose death.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: Insofar as the USA does not provide universal health care, there is a clear societal preference for not prioritising its citizen's health very highly.
1.4.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.8.1.
1.4.3. Pro: Realistically, only people who desperately need money/have nothing to lose will participate, making it exploitative of economic conditions.
1.4.3.1. Pro: These people are also [statistically less likely](https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/review-research-links-between-education-and-poverty) to be educated or informed, raising questions of informed consent.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: Just because people have less education does not mean we should afford them less autonomy or assume they are less able to make informed decisions.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.5.5.4.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.5.3.
1.4.3.2. Con: People who desire fame, a challenge, adrenaline, or violence would also participate. While perhaps misguided, this is not exploitative.
1.4.3.3. Pro: This can even be the case when they do have other options - like getting a standard job - if those other options feel hard to reach.
1.4.3.3.1. Pro: This ends up being, essentially, a "tax" on desperation, similar to lotteries.
1.4.3.4. Con: Taking advantage of people isn't inherently bad. The government frequently allows exploitative actions against its citizens \(for example, allowing people to use their bodies for physical labour\). Instead, one needs to consider the alternatives these people have; if the games could be used to break the poverty cycle, the exploitation might be acceptable.
1.4.3.5. Pro: People who are secure with their lives will not volunteer to sacrifice them. Therefore only people who are more desperate will participate.
1.4.3.5.1. Con: It is not true to say that only desperate people are willing to risk their lives to achieve a goal; people from a diversity of backgrounds risk their lives for something they want or believe in all the time, for example by enlisting in the army.
1.4.3.6. Con: The survivors of these tournaments would gain rewards which would enable social and economic mobility.
1.4.3.6.1. Pro: If your only choices in life are decades of poverty and anguish followed by an early death, or a small chance at fame and fortune, many might prefer to take that risk.
1.4.3.6.2. Pro: If you require a large amount of money very quickly a tournament would provide that opportunity. This could be useful for patients who need to raise money for a live-saving surgery for instance.
1.4.3.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.4.3.6.4. Pro: Companies in search for a keen and bold image could engage tournament winners for commercial appearance which would bring additional income.
1.4.3.7. Pro: People are generally bad at looking at life from a long-term perspective. Sad people whose lives are in a tough spot might underestimate the chances of their life improving and the value of their own life. This policy would push these people to throw away their lives.
1.4.3.7.1. Pro: The state already intervenes and prevents people from committing suicide for this reason.
1.4.3.8. Con: -> See 1.3.1.5.5.
1.4.4. Con: The government should avoid banning things outright because it does not fit with one conception of the way society should be. If it leads to benefits in the long term for the most disadvantaged, then it should be seriously considered.
1.4.5. Pro: Individuals do not have the right to concede their own rights.
1.4.6. Con: The government is given it's power to rule by it's citizens. The laws they define are derived from societal values. Societal values and accepted ethics are defined by the culture one lives in. Culture is in a constant state of flux, and new laws are made to respond to this.
1.4.7. Pro: This form of "tournament" supports the idea of [social-darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism), publicly promoting that humans are inequal in their ability to survive natural selection. This leads people to think that some lives are worth more than others.
1.4.8. Pro: It wouldn't take to long to go from "wanting to participate in death games" to "being dared to participate in death games".
1.4.9. Pro: It helps to make killing people seem like a great way to make money.
1.4.10. Pro: Causing unnecessary death and trauma is unethical.
1.4.11. Pro: People could be blackmailed into competing in the tournament
1.4.11.1. Con: Blackmailing is illegal
1.4.12. Con: In this case, the tournaments are voluntary
1.5. Con: Government support for the games will damage broader society.
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.1.1.
1.5.2. Pro: The government has a strong influencing effect; by supporting the games, the government would be implicitly endorsing the actions which occur within.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Since representative government is supposed to be a combination of societal values put into law, people take cues from the government regarding acceptable behavior and norms.
1.5.2.2. Con: Refusing to ban or stop an activity does not mean that a government heavily endorses said activity. In many cases governments explicitly campaign against activities \(such as smoking\) that they allow.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: However, the pro side of this debate has operated under the assumption that the government would earn money from these tournaments in the form of sponsorship, advertisements etc. It is hard to campaign against them in this situation.
1.5.2.3. Con: It is possible to make a clear distinction between a government condoning the right for these games to exist, and condoning the actions that take place within the game.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: As an example of this kind of distinction, the famous quote "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it" by Evelyn B. Hall, is often used to defend the right to freedom of expression.
1.5.2.3.1.1. Con: The right to free speech cannot be equated with consensual murder.
1.5.3. Con: Allowing sports and other activities that can involve violence and injury to be legal does not mean that the government condones all actions that occur within those activities.
1.5.3.1. Pro: The White House has [hosted a summit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-to-host-a-white-house-summit-on-growing-conerns-over-sports-head-injuries/2014/05/28/d49e48ae-e5ac-11e3-afc6-a1dd9407abcf_story.html) on football and sports concussions in 2014, thereby expressing its concern about the violence and injuries that are part of the game.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Governments do not accept everything that happens in the context of sports matches. In the past, athletes have been prosecuted for assault after deliberate or reckless foul play that goes beyond the laws of the game \([Allison, p. 51](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=4Hu7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=sports+foul+play+legal&source=bl&ots=oMxsTxzmx8&sig=cOyOr4i9S6edR1SzLQoH1EHpVek&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivksXz5Y7QAhUEtpQKHVc4BW4Q6AEIQzAG#v=onepage&q=sports%20foul%20play%20legal&f=false)\).
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Two Indonesian football players [were sentenced](https://law.nus.edu.sg/asli/pdf/WPS019.pdf) \(p. 2\) to three months in prison in 2010 after a fight during a match.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: A Canadian ice hockey player was found [guilty of assault](http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100318&page=1) in 2000 after attacking an opponent on the ice with his stick.
1.5.3.2.3. Pro: An Australian rules football player was sentenced to three months in prison in 1971 after severely injuring a rival player during a game \([Beever, p. 79](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=vei7DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=McNamara+v+Duncan,+1971&source=bl&ots=aXf0j1FAXn&sig=smVT-kFYmfW_P8g1KN6EzuA-ILU&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwitvvDq547QAhWCzbwKHatpCJkQ6AEIbDAJ#v=onepage&q=McNamara%20v%20Duncan%2C%201971&f=false)\).
1.5.3.3. Con: While the government may not condone all actions within a tournament, it would be difficult for them to not implicitly condone the death and murder present in these games as they are the central concept.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: At the very least, it would be viewed by society as an implicit endorsement even if it were not official.
1.5.3.4. Pro: The rules of certain sports attempt to regulate the degree of violence through the code of the games. Referees and match committees can ban players from matches for excessively rough conduct. For example, an Argentinian rugby player was [banned](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/15/rugby-player-banned-three-years-tackling-female-referee) for 3 years for tackling a female referee.
1.5.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.3.
1.5.4. Pro: Society will have to pay for the harms likely to be felt by the winners.
1.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.5.4.2. Con: There are many ways to develop PTSD; if society is preventing some trauma-inducing blood sports, it should prevent all.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: This is a false equivalency. Other blood sports that are currently allowed may have other positive effects that do not exist here, and that outweigh this particular harm.
1.5.4.2.2. Con: These sports should be banned as well. Their current existence is not a reason to allow even more bloody sports.
1.5.4.2.3. Con: According to this logic every kind of \(professional\) sport has to be banned because every sport injury has the potential to trigger [PTSD](http://tinssp.com/what-do-ptsd-war-veterans-and-injured-athletes-have-in-common/).
1.5.4.3. Pro: The tournaments generate negative outcomes for the participants, even those who are considered to be the winners.
1.5.4.3.1. Pro: Given the actions they need to commit to win, even the "winners" of these tournaments are likely to suffer from physical and psychological injuries.
1.5.4.3.1.1. Pro: In order to win, it is necessary to commit at least one murder \(and more in all likelihood\). It is also likely that the winners will witness many atrocities in the games. As with [military service](http://www.military.com/benefits/veterans-health-care/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-overview.html), this has a strong likelihood of leading to some form of post-traumatic stress disorder.
1.5.4.3.1.2. Pro: Given the situation of the games where each of the participants is trying to kill each other, it is likely that the winner will have been involved in a fight where they incur significant physical injury which they need to live with for the rest of their lives.
1.5.4.3.1.3. Con: Nobody is forcing them to partake in these tournaments, they should be considered responsible enough to make the choice to partake themselves.
1.5.4.3.2. Con: Individual competitors can receive significant benefits from competing and winning.
1.5.4.3.2.1. Pro: These tournaments allow some people to become famous.
1.5.4.3.2.1.1. Con: This is a poor reason to allow such violence, given the lack of societal benefits that derive from individual fame.
1.5.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Individual fame may only be beneficial to the individual, rather than society, but the deaths of the losers are also only really a loss at an individual level.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2. Pro: Being famous has the potential to improve one's position in life as it can lead to increased affluence for the individual in addition to a strong feeling of acceptance. Individuals should be allowed to make this trade-off for themselves.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.1. Con: These tournaments offer no guarantee of fame and fortune. In fact, the person has a much higher chance of dying than they do of becoming famous.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.1.1. Con: This is a trade-off that the individual can make for themselves. It is no secret that they have a high chance of dying.
1.5.4.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Some people also just really want to be famous for its own sake.
1.5.4.3.2.1.3. Con: However, there are many other ways for people to become famous than participating in tournaments where most participants die.
1.5.4.3.2.1.3.1. Con: Gaining celebrity through courage and survival is perhaps more worthy of celebrity than being a good actor or musician.
1.5.4.3.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Engaging in a fight to death for the sport of it shouldn't be a definition of having courage. Courage is where someone might, for example, die or get seriously-injured by getting in between a person and a shooter and taking the bullet themselves.
1.5.4.3.2.1.3.2. Pro: Giving celebrity platforms to those most willing and most able to murder may result in a slightly warped media.
1.5.4.3.2.1.3.3. Con: This is not necessarily true for all people. In particular, disadvantaged people may feel like there is no other way to draw attention to themselves and their situation.
1.5.4.3.2.1.4. Pro: Assuming the disadvantaged are most likely to participate, tournament winners could use their celebrity to bring visibility to structural issues in society [as NFL players have done](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/sports/football/colin-kaepernick-anthem-protest-nfl-roger-goodell.html?_r=0).
1.5.4.3.2.1.4.1. Pro: This can occur regardless of whether they eventually win the tournament or not. They can effectively become martyrs for their cause if they strongly believe in it.
1.5.4.3.2.1.5. Pro: Current celebrity culture [lacks racial, gender, and class diversity.](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-oscars-so-white-reaction-htmlstory.html) Winners of these tournaments are more likely to represent societal demographics.
1.5.4.3.2.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.
1.5.4.3.2.2. Con: The vast majority of competitors die, so only a very small few would access any benefits, while most would receive significant harm.
1.5.4.3.2.2.1. Con: Tournament organisers could facilitate, or require, payments to the deceased's families as a form of compensation.
1.5.4.3.2.2.2. Con: Participants, before their games, could arrange sponsorships deals. Even if the participants die the earnings could be directed to their families or a charity of their choice.
1.5.4.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.6.
1.5.4.3.2.4. Con: The fact that there are significant benefits tied to winning only reinforces the coercive nature of these tournaments. This is particularly problematic as people may convince themselves of the possibility of them winning, when the change of that is very small and the alternative is death.
1.5.4.3.2.4.1. Pro: Humans are often excessively optimistic when assessing personal risks [for a range of reasons](http://www.earthmagazine.org/article/comment-our-flawed-perceptions-risk).
1.5.4.3.2.4.2. Con: Presuming these tournaments are very popular, most participants will be well aware of the risks of entry.
1.5.4.3.2.5. Con: Survivors could be stigmatized and excluded from society for their brutal deeds.
1.5.4.3.3. Con: But as long as they are made aware of such potential negative outcomes they should be free to consent to such tournaments, just like smoking people should be free to make choices which cause harm to themselves.
1.5.4.3.4. Pro: Someone who is willing to put his life in danger with high odds of dying should be considered as suicidal. We should not encourage people to take this suicidal decision.
1.5.4.3.4.1. Pro: The families and friends of the players will probably not be consenting to the possible death of their beloved. One individual should not be allowed to hurt his entourage by putting his life in peril.
1.5.4.3.4.2. Con: Eliminating suicidal people from the population unburdens health and welfare systems that would otherwise treat them.
1.5.4.3.5. Pro: In the movies, there are no real winners of the Hunger Games.
1.5.5. Con: The Games may inspire people to take up more healthy activities such as running, archery, and the martial arts.
1.5.5.1. Con: This seems unlikely unless they also wanted to participate in the tournaments themselves. If this is the case, then their likely eventual death offsets the short term health benefits.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Whereas the London Olympics [inspired](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-11/b-l2o111816.php) children to take up sports in the short-term there was no significant long-term effect.
1.5.6. Pro: In case the tournaments become popular they could diminish the population. Officials have to prevent this as it has negative consequences for society.
1.5.6.1. Pro: This could lower the number of citizens who are fit for military service.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: Citizens who want to join the military likely do so because they feel some sense of duty and patriotism. They are likely to still choose the military over these tournaments which do not fulfil that duty.
1.5.6.1.2. Pro: Some citizens who want to join the military might do so because they see it as a platform that allows them to be violent. These citizens are likely to choose the tournaments over the military because it offers a better platform for violent behavior.
1.5.6.2. Pro: A smaller population means a smaller domestic market which is bad for the country's economy.
1.5.6.3. Con: If this really would be the case the tournaments would, in the long run, also decimate the amount of old and sick people who only generate costs for society.
1.5.6.3.1. Con: It is highly unlikely that the old and sick would sign up for these tournaments. After all, they have hardly any chance of surviving or even winning.
1.5.6.4. Con: It seems unlikely that this would diminish the population to any great extent. Assuming that there are not that many willing participants and only a small number of competitions, the number of deaths would be totally insignificant when compared to the overall population.
1.5.7. Con: The games may eliminate naturally aggressive members of society.
1.5.7.1. Con: Naturally aggressive members of the society are not undesirable. Sportspersons, Social Activists among authors are naturally aggressive.
1.5.7.1.1. Con: Agressive people are fine, but violent people are undesirable. Anyone willing signing up for this would be extremely bloodthirsty.
1.5.7.2. Pro: Violent people who have the desire to do harm to others such as serial killers and mass shooters who are going to kill people anyway could do this instead.
1.6. Pro: The government could use these tournaments as an additional source of revenue via the sale of advertisements.
1.6.1. Pro: This money could be used to benefit exactly the groups of people it potentially exploits.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Many governments use lottery systems and lottery taxes to do this already.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Although someone MIGHT get killed or injured by someone committing a crime in the business selling lottery tickets , the act of buying and scratching off lottery tickets \(which might or might not result in winning something\) doesn't directly result in death or serious injury.
1.6.1.2. Con: It is not very efficient to help a disadvantaged group by first exploiting them and then compensating them for that exploitation.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: One of the reasons that governments are not currently very effective at helping disadvantaged groups is because of a lack of social capital from the people it taxes. While this method might be inefficient, the additional revenue stream would avoid this problem.
1.6.1.2.2. Con: If the net impact of that is compensation for these groups, it is probably still a positive.
1.6.2. Con: Governments earning money from fatal tournaments would quickly obtain a bad/exploitative reputation.
1.6.2.1. Con: Governments, such as the USA, are responsible for the deaths of many citizens and foreigners, particularly over the last decade. If anything the Games would distract from these more important problems.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: The USA are already mentioned negatively in the international media because of the [firearms legislation](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/08/graphics-americas-guns) and its consequences. Allowing such tournaments would drastically intensify this negative image and thus damage its reputation.
1.6.2.2. Con: The military is a source of patriotic pride for many countries, even though its purpose is to kill. The Games could similarly redirect violence and blood-thirst towards patriotic or nationalistic ends.
1.6.2.3. Con: It's unclear why this bad reputation necessarily matters to these governments. If it results in the betterment of a group of their disadvantaged citizenry, then it is probably a net benefit for them.
1.6.2.4. Pro: Having a good reputation is important for the country's economical and international relations.
1.6.2.4.1. Con: It seems implausible that a foreign country would be disincentivised from making an agreement with the US because of something as unimportant \(on a global scale\) as these games.
1.6.2.4.1.1. Pro: Ultimately national states follow their interests, which mostly are to secure their existences and to gain wealth and power. As the USA is an important actor, most national states simply cannot afford to overtly critique them.
1.6.2.4.2. Pro: Reputation provides a reason for rational states to comply with costly commitments in the anarchy of international relations, allowing cooperation without friendship between egoists \([Phelan, p.3](https://www.tcd.ie/iiis/documents/discussion/pdfs/iiisdp275.pdf)\).
1.6.2.4.3. Pro: States have to trade off aspects of domestic policy for the good of international diplomacy all the time. In this case, they accept the limitation on freedoms by banning these tournaments to maintain their good reputation among other countries \([Phelan, p.3](https://www.tcd.ie/iiis/documents/discussion/pdfs/iiisdp275.pdf)\).
1.6.2.4.3.1. Pro: For example, many countries invest large sums of money into international aid even when their own citizens are struggling. This highlights how these countries view the importance of being a good global actor.
1.6.2.4.3.2. Pro: Many countries, in particular the USA, execute humanitarian missions and military interventions, hence risk citizens' lives and create costs, in order to stop conflicts and enforce human rights in the affected regions and thus create a corresponding reputation.
1.6.2.5. Con: The USA has huge amounts of [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power#United_States) and cultural capital. It is imaginable that if the USA allowed the tournaments, other nations will follow. Thus the resulting reputation damage would be marginal.
1.6.2.5.1. Con: Cruel measures like capital punishment damage the USA's attractiveness abroad, thus it is reasonable the official toleration of the cruel tournaments will do so as well.
1.6.2.5.1.1. Pro: The grand majority of the USA's allies has abolished [capital punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_country#Industrialized_world) and condemned this procedure as incompatible with human rights.
1.6.3. Con: Governments making money off of the exploitation of their citizens is wrong.
1.6.3.1. Con: There is no exploitation as the participants join voluntarily; the negative consequences are willingly accepted.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.
1.6.3.1.2. Pro: Giving people more choices in society is generally a good thing.
1.6.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.4.
1.6.3.2. Con: Governments exploit their citizens for monetary gain in various other ways. Exploitative structures are thus already in place; these tournaments are not meaningfully different.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Many governments allow gambling. As has been argued, it reallocates wealth from the lower classes to the upper classes, often through neurotic and addictive pressures \([Aasved, p. 49](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=7WqSpCAuUWYC&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=gambling+exploitation&source=bl&ots=x8rUIjpg9U&sig=evWVcw-Pqxxxemni3o6aJUhCKjQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirmZ-dtcXPAhVDpJQKHc-yBCsQ6AEIVjAI#v=onepage&q=gambling%20exploitation&f=false)\).
1.6.3.2.1.1. Con: Allowing gambling is not exploitative but merely negligent.
1.6.3.2.2. Pro: Instead of outright banning tobacco, governments use the taxation of tobacco as a steady source of income - although one that exploits the addiction of citizens.
1.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: As of 2011, the taxation of tobacco and the transfer of profits from state-run tobacco companies was responsible [for 6%](http://www.economist.com/news/china/21597958-smoking-course-kill-100m-chinese-people-century-will-latest-anti-smoking) of the Chinese government's revenue.
1.6.3.2.2.2. Con: Tobacco taxation is not exploitation of citizens but a measure to increase its price and deter people from buying tobacco goods.
1.6.3.2.2.2.1. Con: Regardless of the reasons for this taxation, the fact remains that the government still reaps huge profits from it. This is a huge form of exploitation of its citizens.
1.6.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: [Smoking rates](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/tables/trends/cig_smoking/) among adults in the United States have gone from 42% in 1965 to 16% in 2014. This and [economic research](https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/research/factsheets/pdf/0146.pdf) on the taxes relation to the smoking rates proves that the American government has been successful in reducing the rates through taxation.
1.6.3.2.2.3. Con: As long as the taxation is transparent, documented and general you can hardly speak of exploitation. The same is true for the money made from these tournaments.
1.6.3.2.2.3.1. Con: [Three out of four](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163763/smokers-quit-tried-multiple-times.aspx) American smokers would like to quit and have unsuccessfully tried to do so in the past. The government makes money from their addiction and thus exploits the weakness of smokers to raise revenue.
1.6.3.2.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.3.2.2.2.2.
1.6.3.3. Con: The government already recruits citizens to die for its agenda because it operates a military.
1.6.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.1.
1.6.4. Con: There are other, less socially destructive, ways to raise money for social programs.
1.6.4.1. Pro: Taxation, in particular, can be targeted at groups that are the most well-off.
1.6.5. Pro: Additional revenue could be generated via participation fees, TV or online licenses and merchandise.
1.6.6. Con: This could lead to harmful corruption: the game could be cheated in favor to the most lucrative players.
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.3.2.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.5.4.3.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.4.11.
