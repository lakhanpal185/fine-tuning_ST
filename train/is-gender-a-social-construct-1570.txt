Discussion Title: Is Gender a Social Construct?

1. Gender \(the [concept](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/gendermed/sexandgender.html) of masculinity and femininity\) is a social construct.
1.1. Con: Gender is determined by biological factors.
1.1.1. Pro: Suggesting gender is a construct undermines the breadth of the influence of epigentics and genetics in general, it places too much emphasis on personal choice as opposed to reality. [Epigentics](http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/plus/sfg/resources/res_epigenetics.xhtml) is the change of a trait without [genetic](https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/What-is-Genetics.aspx) changes. [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2788155/) claims that epigenetic changes determine sexual expression.
1.1.1.1. Pro: The example of [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) shows how gender is not learnable and that biology does influence the gender identity process.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Genetic males with genital malformations such as [cloacal exstrophy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1421517/) \(not intersex\) that are assigned the female sex at birth still show interests and attitudes typical of males. Most of them eventually declare themselves to be male. If gender was socially constructed, individuals raised as females would feel female, act as females, and remain female, but they don't.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: [In the Dominican Republic,](http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/pub/eres/SOC217_PIMENTEL/frable.pdf)16 of 18 genetic males were assigned female at birth because of their feminine appearing external genitalia, due to a lack of testosterone in uterus. Reaching puberty, when a new flow of testosterone masculinized their external genitalia, they adopted a male gender identity, proving that the previous socialisation was not enough to influence their biological gender identity.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: The [John/Joan study](https://www.healthyplace.com/gender/inside-intersexuality/the-true-story-of-john-joan) that supposedly proved that gender is a social construct by making a boy into a girl by upbringing. What this study didn't publish was that he rejected his identity as a girl, as soon as he found out that he was born a male. This fradulent study highlights that there is no reason to treat this as a scientific fact until it is proven by any scientifically sound study.
1.1.1.1.4. Pro: In some [studies](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/07/160715114739.htm), infants as young as 9 months old have shown clear preferences for gender specific toys at an early stage, pointing towards the existence of some biological differences.
1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2583786/) in monkeys found similar results in toy preference to the result in children i.e. girl monkeys like girls toys, and boy monkeys like boy toys.
1.1.1.1.4.2. Con: The fact that the study found variability between individual children suggests that toy preferences are not determinative of gender.
1.1.1.1.4.3. Pro: This toy preference shows that existing biological differences support the traditional gender binary system.
1.1.1.1.4.4. Con: However, [a review](http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/pub/eres/SOC217_PIMENTEL/frable.pdf) found that gender constancy is unrelated to sex-typed toy choice.
1.1.1.1.4.5. Pro: The female baby showed a [clear preference](http://infantcognition.tamu.edu/files/2013/10/Alexander-G.M.-Wilcox-T.-Woods-R.-2009.pdf) for the doll, meaning at least an aspect of gender is likely biologically driven.
1.1.1.1.4.6. Con: In another [experiment](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/28/toys-kids-girls-boys-childhood-development-gender-research), researchers put toys that children have never seen before in stereotypically girl packages and boy packages. Girls played with the toys on girls’ boxes and boys with the ones in boy’s boxes, showing the gendered preference was not really marked by the toys.
1.1.1.1.4.7. Con: The [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/07/160715114739.htm) also acknowledges that those differences were based on “developmental-environmental components” thus reinforcing the idea that gender is a learned construct.
1.1.1.1.5. Con: Cultures and religions with differing gender definitions show that [nurture](http://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/nature-versus-nurture), environment and experience, have a strong influence on gender identity.
1.1.1.1.6. Con: Transgender people and non-binary individuals are an example of people who have a gender identity that does not match the gender they were assigned at birth. This shows that gender and biological sex do not necessarily align.
1.1.1.1.6.1. Con: While it may not correlate completely with biological sex, trans and non-binary individuals may still have a biological impetus to identify the way they do.
1.1.1.1.6.1.1. Pro: There is some evidence to suggest that identical twins are [more likely to be both transgender](http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2010to2014/2013-transsexuality.html) than as compared to baseline population rates; suggesting that there is at least some genetic cause.
1.1.1.1.6.1.2. Pro: Transgender individuals — even before undergoing medical procedures such as hormone replacement — have [neurological structures that reflect elements of their gender](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024) rather than their born sex.
1.1.1.1.6.2. Con: Errors in the assignment of gender and or the belief that gender is or is not fluid are not evidence against the claim that gender is biologically rooted.
1.1.1.1.6.3. Con: [Less than one percent of people in America may self identify as transsexual](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/how-many-adults-identify-as-transgender-in-the-united-states/). These people are clearly outliers, and outliers are not a good basis for developing sound social theory.
1.1.1.1.6.3.1. Con: As listed on [page seven of the full report](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/How-Many-Adults-Identify-as-Transgender-in-the-United-States.pdf), this is a partial survey that only collected data from 19 states, many of which were small. In total, only 151,456 people answered the survey. We should not rely on these numbers until we get better data, by say, putting this question on the national census form.
1.1.1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: The fact that [special interests are moving to block the collection of better data on this topic](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/29/521921287/u-s-census-to-leave-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-questions-off-new-surveys) does little to speak to it's credibility.
1.1.1.1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: The actions of special interest groups have nothing to do with the veracity of the data gathered by this report, especially given that the source of this information is [Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Institute_on_Sexual_Orientation_and_Gender_Identity_Law_and_Public_Policy), [a public policy leader in the LGBT sphere](https://law.ucla.edu/news-and-events/in-the-news/2013/07/UCLA-Law-Receives-55-Million-Gift-to-Support-Growth-and-Leadership-of-the-Williams-Institute/).
1.1.1.1.6.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The special interests can still effect the data by effecting the states ability to conduct it impartially, and the individual's ability to answer the questions honestly.
1.1.1.1.6.3.1.2. Con: Implicit in this is the assumption that trans people are somehow vastly under-represented in the selected states. Regardless, even if we doubled the upper bound estimated by this report, we still have a vanishingly small population of \<2% of Americans who identify as transgender.
1.1.1.1.6.3.1.2.1. Con: This survey is based on volunteered information, so small, rural, and traditionally more conservative areas might indeed be over represented in the survey and trans people may be under represented in these areas.
1.1.1.1.6.3.2. Con: These numbers are probably skewed by the discrimination transgender people face in this country.
1.1.1.1.6.3.3. Con: There are many populations, sometimes even smaller ones, that we still consider for good reason.
1.1.1.1.6.3.4. Con: Any theory of gender that does not address even a minority group possessing scientifically recognized possible gender statuses is also unsound in that it is incomplete; that is, it does not account for the full range of observed gender identities.
1.1.1.1.6.3.5. Con: In very large populations \(such as the entire population of the US\) a category containing ~1% of the data is still large enough to not be considered an outlier by the formal statistical definition of the term.
1.1.1.1.6.4. Con: Research in the context of trans identity and biology suggests a biological basis for a [fixed gender identity](http://journals.aace.com/doi/abs/10.4158/EP14351.RA?journalCode=endp&).
1.1.1.1.6.4.1. Pro: Transgender individuals undergoing hormone treatment experience a change in certain behaviour and emotions, such as aggression. Gender can thusly not be entirely separated from the born sex as hormones affect our personality.[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6901550_Estrogen_treatment_effects_on_cognition_memory_and_mood_in_male-to-female_transsexuals)
1.1.1.1.6.4.1.1. Con: Hormone changes impact everyone. They impact the body and they impact behavior regardless of someone's sex or sexual identity. To argue that gender is socially constructed is not to deny hormones and biology have a role and impact people, it is to say that the way society perceives and labels behavior as "masculine" or "feminine" or "gay" or "lesbian" is determined not by the actions themselves but by the society that defines them as such.
1.1.1.1.6.4.2. Pro: The fact that there is definite misalignment shows that there is definite alignment outside of choice and society. Those who suffer from gender dysphoria have the urge to alter their body to fit their gender identity. This proves an inherent correlation between biological sex and gender identity.
1.1.1.1.6.4.3. Pro: The biological component of gender is shown by kids identifying as transgender at a young age, having an acute sense of who they are and understanding what gender they belong to.
1.1.1.1.6.4.4. Pro: Biological sex and gender identity [do not vary independently in 99.4% of the US population.](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/How-Many-Adults-Identify-as-Transgender-in-the-United-States.pdf)
1.1.1.1.6.4.5. Con: Gender is about social expectations, so it cannot be fixed. In fact, social expectations are [continually being constructed](http://spl.ids.ac.uk/sexuality-and-social-justice-toolkit/1-issues-and-debates/what-link-between-sexuality-and-gender) and reinforced through social relationships and economic and political power dynamics.
1.1.1.1.6.4.5.1. Pro: People increasingly identify their gender as a choice, whereby people may be gender queer or gender non-binary, rather than aligning themselves with the expectations of being masculine or feminine.
1.1.1.1.6.4.5.2. Con: The insight that social expectations are attached to gender identities does not exclude the possibility that gender identities are also influenced by biological dispositions.
1.1.1.1.6.4.6. Pro: The fact that many trans people identify strongly with the idea that they are a particular gender suggests there is something inherent about gender that you are born with.
1.1.1.1.6.4.6.1. Con: Children don’t begin to notice and adopt gender-stereotyped behaviors until the [age of three to five](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17650129), when they begin to think about gender as a stable trait and they start to incorporate gender into their own identity.
1.1.1.1.6.4.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.
1.1.1.1.6.4.6.2. Con: For many people, gender identity [changes over time](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/13/living/gender-fluid-feat/), implying that gender is not fixed and thus can be influenced by societal factors.
1.1.1.1.6.4.6.3. Con: Many trans people identify as [non-binary](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/joshua-m-ferguson/non-binary-trans-people_b_12443154.html).
1.1.1.1.6.4.6.3.1. Pro: For example, trans people from older generations usually tend to strongly identify with one gender, whereas among young generations labels such as gender non-binary, genderqueer or gender bender are more common.
1.1.1.1.6.4.7. Pro: [A study](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ravishly/neuroscience-proves-what-_b_6494820.html) showed that brain chemistry corresponds to a spectrum of gender identities between purely male and female and that transgender people's brain chemistry often approached the middle and was shown to be inherently different from the sex they were assigned to at birth.
1.1.1.1.6.4.8. Pro: Not many people would identify as transgender if they could conform to societal expectations. But the fact that so many people identify as trans in spite of increased violence and exclusions, show that there has to be a biological basis.
1.1.1.1.6.4.8.1. Con: Yet maybe some people would not identify as trans if gender was less constraining and less defined.
1.1.1.1.6.4.8.1.1. Pro: Psychologists used to claim that people wanting to transition \(socially or medically\) always felt very distressed by their genitalia, especially during sex [\(p. 533\)](https://justines2010blog.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/dsm-iv.pdf). As gender as a concept [expands](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26753630), this vision is increasingly [changing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27977258), recognising that not every person will feel that way \([p. 451](http://psy-gradaran.narod.ru/lib/clinical/DSM5.pdf)\).
1.1.1.1.6.4.8.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.4.6.3.1.
1.1.1.1.6.5. Con: A person's feeling that they are a different gender than they were assigned at birth is a sign of [Gender Dysphoria](https://psicovalero.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/dsm-v-manual-diagnc3b3stico-y-estadc3adstico-de-los-trastornos-mentales.pdf), a recognized mental disorder.
1.1.1.1.6.5.1. Con: [Gender Dysphoria](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria) is defined as a "difference between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender" causing "significant distress", often leading to hormone replacement therapy or sexual reassignment surgery. Not every transgender person experience it: they might not suffer from dysphoria, not undergo surgeries at all and "just" dress more ambiguously or choose a different name and pronoun \(often the case with non-binary people\). You don't need to have GD in order to be transgender.
1.1.1.1.6.5.2. Con: The [DSM-V](http://psy-gradaran.narod.ru/lib/clinical/DSM5.pdf) claims that gender dysphoria is the distress caused by the “incongruence between one’s experienced or expressed gender and one’s assigned gender” yet not the gender identity. It also states that such distress can be reduced by “supportive environments” and, eventually, medical treatments \(hormones, surgery, etc\).
1.1.1.1.6.5.2.1. Pro: Previously named Gender Identity Disorder, the latest DSM got rid of that denomination altogether, choosing to shift the focus from a person's identity to focus on dysphoria as the clinical problem, not identity per se.
1.1.1.1.6.5.3. Con: Transgender behavior[is found](http://mds.marshall.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&context=etd) in other primates, which suggests it is part of human nature.
1.1.1.1.6.5.4. Con: Homosexuality was also recognized as a mental disorder until it was removed in [1973](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4695779/), and it has been shown that it is a a healthy variation of human sexual [orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_psychology).
1.1.1.1.6.5.4.1. Con: [Many Christian denominations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominational_positions_on_homosexuality) believe that homosexuality is not a biological given but a moral choice, and view it as sinful.
1.1.1.1.6.5.5. Con: Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \(DSM-V\) lists Gender [Dysphoria](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/04/gender-dysphoria-dsm-5_n_3385287.html), the World Health Organization and activists are calling for the [removal](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/health/who-transgender-medical-disorder.html?_r=0) of the condition from the DSM.
1.1.1.1.6.5.6. Pro: According to the DSM-V \([p. 455](http://psy-gradaran.narod.ru/lib/clinical/DSM5.pdf)\), as many as 70% to 98% of natal boys and 50% to 88% of natal girls with Gender Dysphoria \(GD\) eventually accept their biological sex after puberty, so GD was a temporary period of distress.
1.1.1.1.6.5.6.1. Con: DSM-V provides ranges for [persistence rates](http://psy-gradaran.narod.ru/lib/clinical/DSM5.pdf). It thus also states that Gender Dysphoria is not simply resolved after puberty in as many as 30% of children assigned male at birth and as many as 50% of children assigned female at birth.
1.1.1.1.6.5.6.2. Con: Most statistics that claim that a big percentage of children confused about their gender 'outgrow' the problem after puberty have big [methodological](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/01/14/what_alarmist_articles_about_transgender_children_get_wrong.html) flaws such as putting any gender non-conforming kid in the same category. Therefore, most children that are found not to be transgender as teenagers or adults were not transgender to begin with.
1.1.1.1.6.6. Pro: The idea that individuals can have fluid gender identities reinforces the idea that societal concepts of gender are socially constructed.
1.1.1.1.6.6.1. Con: By this logic, the inverse holds true, e.g. "The idea that individuals have fixed gender identities reinforces the idea that societal concepts of gender are socially constructed." The claim asserts a logical link that is not supported, which allows the inverse to be claimed and make just as much sense. The claim that gender is fluid could be true without gender being a social construct.
1.1.1.1.6.6.2. Con: How most people feel about gender identities is not entirely fluid but stable. The fact that somebody does not feel comfortable with their assigned gender at birth suggest that innate gender identities do exist, even though they don't necessarily correlate with one's biological sex.
1.1.1.2. Con: Nevertheless, the social expression of sex, no matter how influenced by biology, remains a 'social' phenomenon. How a man is expected to dress, talk, associate, act is social and is constructed by society. Nothing in biology says men can't wear dresses.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Nothing in biology says men can't wear a dress, but a man wearing a dress doesn't mean he has changed his gender.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: However, a man wearing a dress, as well as other traditionally feminine features convincingly \(for example, an actor\) can be perceived as a woman and no longer a man, therefore his gender, understood as purely his socially perceived sex, does change.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: This may illustrate a fundamental discrepancy in the language used to conceptualize gender. Gender may have come to mean something other than the expression of biological traits traditionally associated with one or another gender. And this is entirely possible and legitimate because language does not derive its meaning from biology, but from implicit social contracts and usage in the everyday.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Epigenetics is still biologically delineated. Epigenetic outcomes vary by gender.[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3654067/)
1.1.1.4. Pro: Synthetic estrogen leaches from plastic into our water and [food](https://www.npr.org/2011/03/02/134196209/study-most-plastics-leach-hormone-like-chemicals). This change in our environment could lead to hormonal imbalances causing people to have related problems including significant impacts on gene expression in the brain which can likely make males feel more [feminine](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/02/11440/male-and-female-behavior-deconstructed).
1.1.1.5. Con: NCBI is a collection of studies, and is not itself a peer-reviewed scientific journal. It is more of a repository for biotechnical data and reference archive than a stand-alone reputable source.
1.1.2. Con: Scientific evidence does not fully answer this question yet, but it's likely that gender is both biological and socially constructed. Society's influence on gender has developed and changed over time as human cultures have evolved, but the biological influence has been ever-present along with the social influences. It will be difficult to separate the two influences entirely.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Biology and social constructs are not mutually exclusive. In fact, social constructs exist because of biology. Gender is not one or the other. It is a nuanced mix of both. The "social constructs" which exist in society are based or inspired by biological impulses and dispositions; they are fluid but that does not exclude biology from their basis.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The [psychosocial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial) model is used in social sciences and [Engel's biopsychosocial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model) model in all approaches to human health events, and it has applications in psychology to sociology fields.
1.1.2.2. Pro: There is no scientific consensus on what biological processes, if any, influence the personal experience of gender identity.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: While more research is needed, it is ignorant to say hormones and brain structure do not play a part in our behavior, character development, and [gender](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09513590400018231).
1.1.3. Con: This view is not incompatible with gender being a social construct. A person's kindness is determined by biological factors \(their capacity for empathy, for example\), but that doesn't mean kindness is not socially constructed.
1.1.3.1. Con: This challenge would seem to put fourth a weakly bounded description of what constitutes a socially constructed entity such that almost all human characteristics are arguably social constructs.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: You can never isolate the influence of both biology and society [regarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial) human behaviour.
1.1.3.2. Con: This presumes social behaviour isn't as biologically constructed as gender is.
1.1.3.3. Pro: For example, women are believed to be more emphatic. However, [research](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/women_more_empathic_than_men) also shows that from the start, men and women “do not differ consistently in their ability to detect their own or other people’s emotions” and thus if women end up becoming more emphatic may be due a different socialization.
1.1.3.3.1. Con: In a [highly cited 2006 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18633782), empathy in male children is *negatively* correlated with higher fetal testosterone during pre-natal development.
1.1.4. Pro: Distribution of [MBTI Types](http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1) by gender suggest natural differences in preferences between the [two sexes](http://www.slayerment.com/mbti-gender). MBTI preferences are not influenced by society and are considered more instinctual.
1.1.4.1. Pro: While the personality types [ENTJs](https://medium.com/\@andrewbermudez/entj-personality-ceos-is-it-a-curse-6eb06431842b) are the CEOs of the world the [ISFJs](https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality) are the primary school teachers of the world.
1.1.4.2. Con: [Research](http://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1470&context=etd-project) suggests that Myers-Briggs Type Indicator \(MBTI\) may be influenced by gender [stereotypes](https://udayton.edu/blogs/voicesraised/17-09-20-mbti.php) more than personalities based on inborn preferences.
1.1.4.3. Con: Many psychologists do not consider MBTI tests [reliable](https://melmagazine.com/rethink-putting-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-in-your-dating-profile-1c94eabf9996). The expert [Robert Hogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hogan_\(psychologist\)) even [regarded](https://www.vice.com/en_nz/article/bjv8y5/the-myers-briggs-personality-test-bullshit) them as "a little more than a Chinese fortune cookie”. Therefore a basis for biological gendered differences based on them is not solid.
1.1.5. Pro: Sex hormones have established and profound effects on behaviour in humans and in animals. For example [testosterone](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08711) is anti-anxiety, anti-depressive, increases protectiveness, [aggression](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/36/15268.short) under threat perception and decreases risk perception. These hormonal effects map perfectly onto gender typical personality traits. Likewise oxytocin increases bonding and social behaviours, such as ingroupishness.
1.1.5.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222523781_Foetal_testosterone_and_eye_contact_in_12-month-old_human_infants) which have tracked the eye-movements of newborn babies have found that female babies would focus more often on a face, whereas male babies would focus on a mechanical object. Hence, people/thing object orientation is revealed as a [biological](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5LRdW8xw70) human trait.
1.1.5.2. Con: All of those hormones are present in both males and females, and to varying degrees in each group. A male's oxytocin levels rival a woman's, post-coitus, yet we don't say that post-coital males are females. A male's testosterone levels are [sensitive to social variables](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453004000095?via%3Dihub), yet we don't allow these variables to determine their gender. Gender therefore cannot be reducible to differences in sex hormone concentration.
1.1.6. Con: Many behaviors understood as signals that one pertains to a certain gender are not biologically generated. If one wants to be seen as feminine or masculine, they can express it with their body movements, their voice, their clothes, the way they interact with people they want to have sex with or not, etc.
1.1.6.1. Con: Natural vocalizations and body movements are largely based on physiological factors determined by genetics.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Changes in vocalization occurs most markedly during the male transition through puberty, which is governed by increases in testosterone and other hormones, governed by the male's genetic disposition \(XY chromosomes\).
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: The pelvis, one of the most notable features of human male-female [skeletal dimorphism](http://johnhawks.net/explainer/laboratory/sexual-dimorphism-pelvis.html), affects an individual's gate depending on its relative size and shape.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: However, [research](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2007-09-sexual-revealed-body-motion.html) shows that gay men and women, despite their physiological characteristics, present "more gender-incongruent body motions \(hip-swaying for men, shoulder-swaggering for women\) than their straight counterparts", therefore supporting the idea that the way of walking is influenced by factors beyond body structure.
1.1.6.1.3. Con: While there are slight differences in muscle mass or bone structure, the way humans move is based on training. If a certain way of moving is considered to be "male" or "female", this perception is based on our constructions of gender. An example for this would be the [stereotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_stereotype_of_the_male_ballet_dancer) of the male ballet dancer as "effeminate".
1.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: "Training" is learned from or imposed by society, making it a social construct.
1.1.6.1.3.2. Pro: [Research](https://www.livescience.com/2853-odd-gender-differences-walking.html) shows that people when presented with computer images of a gender-neutral walker, they categorize it half the time as female and half the time as male.
1.1.6.1.4. Con: [This review](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a597428.pdf) of modern studies has found that in modern empirical kinematic studies, sex differences regarding gait are surprisingly limited, contradictory, or equivocal.
1.1.6.2. Con: Other movement-related behaviors, such as [handwriting](http://www.irjes.com/Papers/vol4-issue4/A440105.pdf), are based in part on genetics.
1.1.6.3. Con: Imitation does not equate to changing your biological essence.
1.1.7. Pro: [Complementarity](http://www.laici.va/content/dam/laici/documenti/donna/filosofia/english/man-woman-complementary-the-catholic-inspiration.pdf) of women and men is at the heart of our personal, educational and societal experience and it is rooted \(not exclusively but primordially\) in biological facts. In order to develop [fully and harmoniously](https://www.plough.com/en/topics/life/marriage/not-just-good-but-beautiful), a human being [needs the reciprocity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4235963/) of male and female characteristics.
1.1.7.1. Con: [Complementarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism), the idea that men and women have different but complementary roles and responsibilities in various areas of life is a theological view in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. It is thus not an objective fact but the interpretation of faith.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Even with Christianity, organizations like Christians for Biblical Equality are [critical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism#Criticism) of complementarianism, and instead promote egalitarianism.
1.1.7.2. Con: Complementarianism is used to emphasize differences between the sexes rather than focusing on commonalities. As such, [many](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/complementarity-sexes-trap) see it as an outdated concept.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: Many people find comfort in the idea of a [soulmate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulmate#Plato), as is obvious in colloquialisms like referring to partners as one's "better half".
1.1.7.3. Con: Complementarianism is a form of [benevolent sexism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambivalent_sexism). While it argues that women have important and complementary roles to men, this philosophy works to retain the status quo of labor division and restricts women to supporting roles in leadership of communities.
1.1.7.4. Pro: [Complementarity](http://www.laici.va/content/dam/laici/documenti/donna/filosofia/english/man-woman-complementary-the-catholic-inspiration.pdf) is not to be confused with [Complementarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism). Complementarism is a form of fractional complementarity \(such as found in Plato's idea of men / women as corresponding "halves" of humanity\) which easily leads to stereotypes and a hierarchical interpretation \(usually men over women\).
By contrast integral complementarity emphasizes identity \(equal dignity\) and difference when it comes to the sexes.
1.1.8. Pro: Ignoring the biological factors of gender can have harmful consequences such as unfair sporting [events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U4KGz72SEg). Men can have an unfair advantage over women. A man who decides he is a woman shouldn't be allowed to compete in women's sports without disclosure.
1.1.8.1. Pro: The biological basis of gender involves more than simply measurement of current hormone levels. People that have gone through puberty as a male have higher bone density, and more lean muscle mass than those who have gone through puberty as a female.
1.1.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.4.
1.1.10. Pro: [Academic research](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview6) has shown that men's and women's brains work differently, e.g. men tend to be better at systemizing while women can empathize better.
1.1.10.1. Con: Gendered socialization starts at a very young age as caregivers make \(often unconscious\) [assumptions](https://youtu.be/nWu44AqF0iI) about children's desires and interests. Additionally, this results in girls not being challenged with physically or mentally stimulating games, and thus being put at a disadvantage in the long run.
1.1.10.2. Pro: According to the [empathizing-systematizing theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathizing%E2%80%93systemizing_theory), there is a direct link between careers choosen by men and women and their neurological differences.
1.1.10.3. Con: Research shows brain differences between atheists and religious people. Brain difference can be socially constructed. In fact it is likely that they are. [independent.co.uk](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/atheists-more-intelligent-than-religious-people-faith-instinct-cleverness-a7742766.html)
1.1.10.4. Pro: These traits are not constructed by society but based in biology, as they can be observed in[one-day-old babies.](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview6)
1.1.10.4.1. Con: The cited summary mentions this in passing, no mention of how this is done, or what difference this is is mentioned.
1.1.10.5. Con: This only proves that male and female have different operational characteristics. The brain can develop higher functioning in one area over another depending on what has been nurtured externally.
1.1.10.6. Con: The study quoted is a book written by a physiologist that lacks hard [evidence](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/11/brains-men-and-women-aren-t-really-different-study-finds): neuroscientists seem to contradict his theories.
1.1.10.6.1. Pro: Moreover, [experts](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/11/brains-men-and-women-aren-t-really-different-study-finds) say that their research on human brains "undermines the justifications for single-sex education based on innate differences”.
1.1.10.6.2. Pro: Male and female brains are similar but ‘[wired](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3440193/Men-women-really-different-brains-Roadmaps-reveal-changes-neural-networks-make-behave-differently.html)’ differently. That is, brains are not gendered but neurological connections may be, yet researchers still do not know if that is the product of biology or society. Some think it is precisely the dripping effect of gender [stereotypes](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10684179/Men-and-women-do-not-have-different-brains-claims-neuroscientist.html) that modifies brain connections.
1.1.11. Pro: Androgens and estrogens, as well as other hormones, have an undeniable effect on our brains during gestation. The effect of such hormones is not transient but lasting.
1.1.11.1. Pro: Gender is mostly determined by DNA & hormones. Even in cases of gender dysphoria \(where people don't identify with their gender assigned at birth\), there is typically a biological factor involved, such as Autism or Psychosis. [Psychosis and the Female/Maternal Brain](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-imprinted-brain/201009/psychosis-and-the-femalematernal-brain). [Women with more male-like brain anatomy are 3x more likely to be diagnosed with Autism](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/autism-brains-typical-male-design-high-risk-researchers-christine-ecker-goethe-university-a7569681.html).
1.1.11.1.1. Con: Placement on this proposed psychosis/autism spectrum is certainly an interesting concept, and may have some association with gender, but it remains to be demonstrated if it is gender.
1.1.11.1.2. Pro: Although not initially apparent, it is unsurprising that there is a strong correlation between Autism and "transgenderism." Autistic people have a [reduced/warped cognitive ability for categorization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3058590/) which alters their perceptions of and reactions to stimuli from the five senses.
1.1.11.2. Pro: While gender appears to be clustered with "biological sex", there is [no scientific evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12479841) that this is the sole determinant of human or animal behavior. Research in human and animals supports the hypothesis that biological factors outside of genetic or genital identity determine the complement of sexually dimorphic behaviors, and these are subject to lots of variance.
1.1.11.2.1. Con: There are substantive, qualitative differences between men and women which, while faced with outliers, follow undeniable correlative trends stemming from the reality of sexual dimorphism. Social constructs may reinforce or accentuate these differences, but they are not responsible for creating them.
1.1.11.3. Pro: In the research report,["Sex Differences in Human Neonatal Social Perception"](http://www.math.kth.se/matstat/gru/godis/sex.pdf), Professor Simon Baron-Cohen states that the higher the level of testosterone levels in the uterus, the longer it takes for boys to learn to talk and develop social skills - but the more interested they become of \(technical\) systems. Therefore can biological factors determine career paths.
1.1.11.4. Con: Gender cannot be measured in terms of hormones. Transgender patients who change their hormones are no less the gender they identify with before they begin treatment.
1.1.11.4.1. Con: Effects of hormonal exposure in utero are lasting. For example: A female fetus exposed to [too much testosterone](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2778233/) will likely develop into a female with [male-typical behaviors](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13293-015-0022-1?site=bsd.biomedcentral.com) and are [more likely to identify](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951011/) with a male gender. This means prenatal exposure to testosterone will [likely cause a female to identify as male](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/245845/Gender-identity-in-CAH-MS-final-Pasterski.pdf?sequence=1) \("... prenatal androgen exposure, at least in girls, is related to increased cross-gender identification..." *aka [trans](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/transgender?s=t)\)
1.1.11.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.3.
1.1.11.4.2. Con: The relevant point is that certain types of behavioral patterns that are culturally associated with femininity or masculinity, have been overwhelmingly shown to be strongly correlated with serum levels of sex hormones. This lends credence to the argument that biological sex come with some quasi-essential properties. Therefore, gender as represented in gendered behaviour is not a social construction but partially determined biologically.
1.1.11.5. Con: Hormones are subject to variation, and hormone levels do not always correlate to gender identity.
1.1.11.5.1. Pro: Some women have high levels of [testosterone](https://www.healthline.com/health/facts-about-testosterone#excesstestosterone) and yet that does not seem to change their gender identity as they identify as women.
1.1.11.5.1.1. Pro: Testosterone is a naturally occurring hormone. [Some athletes](http://sociologyinfocus.com/2016/08/sex-is-a-social-construction-even-if-the-olympics-pretends-its-not/) have been tested with higher than allowed levels and were subsequently excluded from competing in women's competitions. In 2015, the Court of Arbitration for Sports suspended the hyperandrogenism rules saying that there is no evidence higher testosterone levels result in a competitive advantage.
1.1.11.5.1.2. Con: Even in extreme cases such as female Olympic athletes judged to have too-high testosterone levels to fairly compete against other women, these women only had testosterone levels that fell in the low to low-normal range of male [testosterone levels](https://www.healthline.com/health/low-testosterone/testosterone-levels-by-age#adolescence).
1.1.11.5.2. Con: Those hormones that are called "sex hormones" are called that because they have been, scientifically, [discovered](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1939/butenandt-facts.html) as conforming to different [profiles](https://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/83686) for biological males vs. females. Most people, by far, except a small fraction \([less than 1%](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/How-Many-Adults-Identify-as-Transgender-in-the-United-States.pdf)\), identify as the gender they were assigned at birth. Therefore, gender identity is in fact 99% consistent with being caused by hormonal history of the individual.
1.1.11.6. Pro: The presence or absence of androgen is [critical](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01541042) for the organization and differentiation in brain development.
1.1.11.7. Pro: A 2013 [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130407090835.htm) presented at the British Neuroscience Association showed that exposure to high levels of stress hormones in the womb can cause mood disorders later in life.
1.1.11.8. Pro: Alcohol use by pregnant women can [interfere](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh22-3/170.pdf) with a fetus' development by disturbing the functions and interactions of maternal and fetal hormones. This can affect the body's response to stress, reproductive functions, metabolic functions, and growth.
1.1.11.9. Pro: Androgen and estrogen contribute to fetal programming of [ovarian dysfunction](https://rbej.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477-7827-4-17). Fetal estrogen deficiency, for example, results in irregularities of ovarian development, and subsequently immature and abnormal adult ovaries.
1.1.12. Con: While the discovery of the Y chromosome was initially hailed as proof of absolute gender, there are exceptions. A [girl born with a Y chromosome](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16934-girl-with-y-chromosome-sheds-light-on-maleness/), for example, but otherwise female organs shows that we make arbitrary cultural calls to decide which trait defines even biological sex.
1.1.12.1. Con: The girl in question has the sex organs of a female \(even though they may not all work properly.\) Biologically, she is female, because this is what the \(faulty\) morphogenesis dictated.
1.1.13. Con: All of the sciences, all of them, are in the business of providing ontological maps, not of dictating or making determinations concerning what is. The maps are always social constructs. Pointing to biology as evidence of an ontological reality is, in the case of gender, committing the logical fallacy of "Mistaking the Map with the Territory." Alfred Whitehead refers to this as ["misplaced concreteness](https://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/)."
1.1.14. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.
1.1.15. Con: Being assigned a certain gender comes with social expectations about one's sexuality, so sexuality is part of the expectations that form gender. There is evidence that [sexuality is socially constructed](http://spl.ids.ac.uk/sexuality-and-social-justice-toolkit/1-issues-and-debates/what-link-between-sexuality-and-gender), which implies that gender as a whole is socially constructed as well.
1.1.15.1. Con: Many LGBTQ people identify strongly with the idea that they are a particular sexual orientation.
1.1.15.2. Pro: [Desire is context-dependent](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674032262&content=reviews), thus sexual identity is not fixed.
1.1.15.3. Pro: The concept of ["innate bisexuality"](http://www.collective-evolution.com/2014/10/17/are-we-all-a-little-bisexual-exploring-gender-identities-cultural-programming/) asserts that all humans are born predisposed to bisexuality but gain other sexualities throughout later psychological development.
1.1.15.4. Con: The fact that many trans individuals wish to adapt their physical appearance to the gender they identify with, suggests the existence of a strong connection between physical/biological sex and gender identity.
1.1.15.4.1. Pro: If gender were a social construct, transgender people wouldn't feel the need to alter their physical appearance or undergo hormone therapy and/ or surgeries. A man can be feminine and a woman can be masculine, but that does not negate the fact that their gender is literally encoded within their biology.
1.1.15.4.2. Con: Transgender individuals tend to stress the gender they identify with, showing how much femininity/masculinity are socially constructed and not biological.
1.1.15.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.4.6.3.
1.1.15.5. Con: It is a logical fallacy to assume that gender in its entirety is socially constructed just because parts of it are not entirely determined by biology.
1.1.15.6. Pro: [According to this study](http://www.thenewatlantis.com/docLib/20160819_TNA50SexualityandGender.pdf), the understanding of sexual orientation as an innate, biologically fixed property of human beings - the "born this way" notion - is not supported by scientific evidence.
1.1.15.6.1. Con: However, the same study also points that scientific research on the issue states that there are “some biological factors” that can “to an unknown extent” influence sexual orientation.
1.1.16. Pro: The differences between men and women are all connected to reproductive functions.
1.1.16.1. Pro: Only women are naturally capable of childbirth, breastfeeding, menstruation, and menopause.
1.1.16.1.1. Con: After menopause, when women lose their capacity to menstruate and have children, their gender identification remains the same, indicating that menstruation and the capacity to bear children does not contribute to gender identity.
1.1.16.1.1.1. Con: A post-menopausal woman's identity is still to a great extent founded upon her experience during her child-bearing years despite her current inability to reproduce, which is a product of her genetics and not a social construct.
1.1.16.1.1.1.1. Con: Founded upon her experience during her life, a portion of which may or may not have been spent on child-bearing and -raising. Whether or not a woman has had, will have, or can have children, does not affect her gender, or her gender identity.
1.1.16.1.2. Con: There have been [cases](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-males-can-lactate/) of men lactating.
1.1.16.1.2.1. Con: However, it is almost impossible that male lactation occurs spontaneously and therefore  the supply of [hormones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_lactation#Human_male_lactation) is necessary.
1.1.16.1.2.2. Con: There have been no cases of men breastfeeding or giving birth.
1.1.16.1.2.2.1. Con: There is some anecdotal evidence that [men](http://www.unassistedchildbirth.com/inspiration/milkmen-fathers-who-breastfeed/) \(and by extension trans women and [trans men after surgery](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/20/transgender-dad-breastfeeding-pregnancy-trevor-macdonald)\) can, in fact, breastfeed.
1.1.16.1.2.2.2. Con: [There](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_pregnancy) [have](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Beatie) [been](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/transgender-man-gives-birth-baby-first-child-woman-kaci-sullivan-wisconsin-a8107481.html) [instances](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4169089,00.html)  of trans men giving birth.
1.1.16.1.2.2.2.1. Con: "Trans" is a social construct not based in biology--- hence the "need" for surgery to give birth.
1.1.16.1.2.2.2.2. Con: Biologically and genetically, they still had most characteristics of womanhood.
1.1.16.1.2.2.3. Con: There are significant advances in [uterine transplantation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus_transplantation) that may soon allow persons born without genetically and biologically female anatomy, including [AMAB](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/amab) trans* people and men, to [become pregnant and give birth.](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/men-pregnant-womb-transplant-dr-richard-paulson-transgender-a8037201.html)
1.1.16.1.2.2.3.1. Con: This would still require a uterus and eggs from a woman.
1.1.16.1.2.3. Con: [Outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier) do not contribute to statistical significance.
1.1.16.1.2.4. Con: Men lactating is usually a result of medical [problems](https://www.fatherly.com/health-science/why-men-breastfeed-lactate/).
1.1.16.1.3. Con: Many women are infertile or have nonfunctioning ovaries and yet still maintain a feminine expression of gender.
1.1.16.1.4. Con: All these are matters of sex, not of gender.
1.1.16.1.5. Con: Roles and expectations in a household, decisions of clothes and makeup, and perceived acceptability of careers have nothing to do with genetic factors.
1.1.16.1.5.1. Con: To claim roles have nothing to do with genetic factors assumes expectations inform the roles. However, if heritable personality traits that were naturally selected for in the evolutionary process combined with biological realities like child birth predispose the sexes to specific roles, then one would expect \(not require\) the sexes to assume those roles. The roles inform the expectations. This has been proven on the [genetic level](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/per.629) and also through extensive [clinical study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/games-primates-play/201201/gender-differences-in-personality-are-larger-previously-thought).
1.1.16.1.5.1.1. Con: Measuring personality traits of women and men, without considering if those traits have been genetically inherited or are [socially conditioned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/15/girls-boys-think-same-way), does not really prove the biological subtract of those differences. If women are taught from early ages to be warmer and emphatic \(and are more punished if they are not\) and men are taught to be more assertive and dominant, to compare adult characteristics and find a [match](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/get-over-it-men-and-women-are-from-the-same-planet/), does not prove where those traits really come from.
1.1.16.1.5.1.2. Con: In order to measure evolutionary differences, the [clinical study](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/get-over-it-men-and-women-are-from-the-same-planet/) should include more than one population of the species as well as traits that can be linked with “heritable aspects of human physiology or behavior”. The [study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029265) only includes a small sample of mostly white and educated Americans and the traits measured are heavily conditioned by social contexts and not universally transferable between cultures.
1.1.16.1.6. Pro: Gender roles are a product of evolution and biologically constructed. The needs of the child during and after birth necessitate the hunter/protector role of the male and the nurturer/caregiver role of the female. [Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/per.629) has selected for particular personality traits in male and female in response to this biological circumstance. These personality traits inform the roles and behaviors distributed between the sexes.
1.1.16.2. Con: The differences between men and women are not limited to reproductive functions. Gender \(unlike sex\) transcends physical-physiological functions. Material culture such as clothing is not determined only by the structure of the body, but on social tradition. E.g. There is no biological reason that determines the use of a skirt by women and not by men.
1.1.16.2.1. Con: Culture does not compare to gender in that way. Similarities in the assignment of gender roles between the sexes are near universal across all known cultures. Noticing that aspects of culture are not bound by biology does not address whether or not gender is bound by biological realities.
1.1.16.3. Con: As an example, [hormones](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jos/2011/702735/) \(testosterone and estrogen\) assists with [muscle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4285578/) production, meaning men and women tend to put muscle on [differently](https://www.livestrong.com/article/355987-female-male-muscles/) given similar exercise. The connection between muscle distribution and reproductive function is tenuous at best.
1.1.16.3.1. Con: [Estrogen](https://www.livestrong.com/article/355987-female-male-muscles/) generally makes women's muscles have less strength but more resistance to fatigue, and it also makes women's bodies able to hold more fat than men. These characteristics are probably related to improving women's ability at [childbearing](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090302115755.htm).
1.1.16.4. Pro: Men and women evolved to be attracted to the opposite sex. This encourages procreation and the continuation of the human species.
1.1.16.5. Pro: [The evolutionary approach](http://www.simplypsychology.org/gender-biology.html) argues that differences in sex behavior are based on biological reproductive desires, whereby men seek to spread their genetic material while women are more selective in reproducing.
1.1.16.5.1. Con: Biologically-driven reproductive desires are clearly not universal given homosexuality has been common throughout human history.
1.1.16.5.1.1. Con: Homosexuality may be considered common, but not prevalent. Homosexuality as a percentage of any given population is an outlier. Behavioral and evolutionary psychological studies of sexuality are looking for statistically significant differences of the means by gender. Finding universality is unnecessary. If observed, the standard of [statistical significance](https://study.com/academy/lesson/statistical-significance-definition-levels-quiz.html) is enough to satisfactorily identify a relationship between biology and gender.
1.1.16.5.2. Pro: With the prevalence of sperm and the rarity of an egg and a vessel which to carry the unborn, a man can impregnate several women a day, while the woman can only be impregnated once every 9 months and carry the fetus. This means men adapted more disposable features like warrior or hunter \(less impact to the species if they die\) and women adapted more care taking features. Women also adapted more docile features to trigger the protector instinct in men.

[therealrevo.com](http://therealrevo.com/blog/?p=19284)
1.1.16.5.2.1. Con: We aren't only determined by our genes, our social upbringing also affects who we are as well.  Many non biological factors affect social upbringing, such as religion, economics, and education.
1.1.16.5.3. Con: Evolutionary theory makes less sense in today's society, where many women participate in casual sex and contraception has developed which allows women to have more control over their reproduction.
1.1.16.6. Con: [Social structural theory](http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/denisiuk.html) emphasizes that mate selection by women is not only focused on reproduction of children but also on power and social status.
1.1.17. Con: [Social structural theory](http://www.personalityresearch.org/papers/denisiuk.html) views gender differences as psychological attempts to adjust to social expectations.
1.1.17.1. Con: Social Constructionism  [completely ignores evolutionary biology and genetics almost in their entirety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism#Criticisms), and wide swaths of cognitive psychology.
1.1.17.2. Con: Gender, like every human behavior, mating rituals, eating customs, etc., is not completely biologically determined. Yet, [there is a biological factor involved](http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/pub/eres/SOC217_PIMENTEL/frable.pdf).
1.1.17.3. Pro: Patriarchal societies have an interest in perpetuating a societal system traditionally run by men. They do this through the idea of fixed gender identities and roles.
1.1.17.3.1. Con: There is [no evolutionary basis](https://www.scribd.com/document/78843926/Barbara-Smuts-The-Evolutionary-Origins-of-Patriarchy) for a socially constructed patriarchy.
1.1.17.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.1.17.3.1.2. Con: This [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258349109_The_Evolutionary_Origins_of_Patriarchy) also states that, although patriarchy is the product of reproductive strategies typically shown by male primates, human males are not “genetically programmed” to coerce and control women and that different human cultures show a range of possible behaviors which are not completely determined by biology but socially constructed.
1.1.17.3.1.2.1. Pro: Therefore, in some human cultures, there are behaviors, rules and practices that indeed try to coerce and control women as a form of social organization and control.
1.1.17.3.2. Pro: Men earn on average [17% more than women](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/03/gender-pay-gap-facts/) in the workplace.
1.1.17.3.2.1. Con: Young, single, childless working women earn up to [20% more](http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html) than their male peers.
1.1.17.3.2.2. Con: Men and women are close to wage parity at graduation, but earning start to [diverge around time of childbirth.](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/harvard-prof.-takes-down-gender-wage-gap-myth/article/2580405)
1.1.17.3.3. Pro: While gender roles and our notions of what is masculine and what is feminine are indeed social constructs, gender itself is based on biological terms as a way to opress women in a patriarchal system. All over the world, most countries define that a female is one with a vagina and a male one with a penis, and that the one with the penis is the dominant. Most trans issues nowadays are coming to light because of the inconformity against gender roles rather than gender itself.
1.1.17.3.4. Pro: Gender is a social construct that allocates relative power. Where a trait is considered feminine, it is allocated less power. We see this economically where 'feminine' industries, eg. the caring sectors like aged care and childcare are significantly underpaid relative to 'masculine' industries like engineering and tech.
1.1.17.3.5. Con: Patriarchy is a social construct that has been used to create an overarching argument for inequality. In reality there are dominance hierarchies in both biological genders that date back millions of years.
1.1.17.3.5.1. Pro: Worth noting that the vast majority of men are born and brought up by women. The vast majority of primary teaching is also by women. Both men and women have played roles in creating the human societies we observe and must accept responsibility accordingly.
1.1.17.3.6. Con: Even if gender roles are entirely socially constructed they may serve a [purpose](https://www.mercatornet.com/family_edge/view/do_traditional_gender_roles_mean_a_better_relationship/12834). It seems that, in the US, breaking down traditional gender roles has lead to broken relationships and each person having to perform all roles. Men and woman have to come together to create a child, staying together to raise a child can divide tasks allowing men and women to rely on each other. This can lead to a feeling of purpose and prevent the exhausting idea / consequence  that we each have to do [everything](https://www.buzzle.com/articles/advantages-of-the-traditional-nuclear-family.html).
1.1.17.3.6.1. Con: Less strict gender roles or lack thereof, allow loving relationships in which two people are equal partners who can share tasks. That is a far better outcome than relationships in which one side is limited to provide economically \(and find purpose in career realization\) and the other is constrained to childcare and house chores.
1.1.17.3.6.1.1. Con: Gender roles don't mean the two people aren't equal. If one person could make enough money to support the family, it frees the other from having to provide. Helping each other in this way lightens the load rather than limiting or constraining.
1.1.17.3.6.1.2. Pro: Traditional gender roles have historically kept women from being able to work, to be economically independent, to vote or to own property. The fact that women now have equal options and can freely decide to have children with a supportive partner or alone, not to have children, or to divorce is definitely more just and fair for women.
1.1.17.3.6.1.2.1. Pro: The fact that gender roles have loosened, means that women and men can have more choices, including forming families with very strict gender roles if they choose to.
1.1.17.3.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Too many choices make people less [happy](https://brainfodder.org/paradox-of-choice/).
1.1.17.3.6.2. Con: Modern [ways of living](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-having-more-single-people-is-good-for-society-2017-4) as well as contemporary [capitalism](http://csis.msu.edu/sites/csis.msu.edu/files/Ewan%20Morrison_%20what%20I'm%20thinking%20about%20...%20why%20capitalism%20wants%20us%20to%20stay%20single%20_%20Books%20_%20guardian.co_.pdf), that exacerbates acquiring wealth over other values and considers individualism and choice paramount aspects, may also be related to more people being single or divorcing.
1.1.17.3.6.2.1. Pro: Economy and capitalism have made the [family](https://theconversation.com/more-people-than-ever-before-are-single-and-thats-a-good-thing-74658) unit and marriage evolve according to economic necessities.
1.1.17.3.6.2.1.1. Con: In the past many men started working overtime to get ahead. Then men had to work overtime to make ends meet. Women started working to get ahead. Now men and women often both have to work to make ends meet. Businesses and the economy respond to the labor force and demand for products.  Even if lack of gender roles didn't cause the problem, it adds to the problem. A system in which some had the option of financial support from another seems better.
1.1.17.3.6.3. Con: In Japan young people are marrying and having children less \(the population is shrinking\). Though the lack of traditional [gender roles](https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21706321-most-japanese-want-be-married-are-finding-it-hard-i-dont) and women working are often quoted as the cause: it is the other way around. Men are still expected to be the [breadwinners](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/07/japan-mystery-low-birth-rate/534291/) and, despite the booming economy, as young men do not get stable and well-paid jobs, young generations are not starting families.
1.1.17.3.6.4. Con: That fails to take into account the number of unhappy marriages and even abusive ones women had to endure because they had no other economical, social and political options.
1.1.17.3.6.4.1. Pro: In modern times, marriage has evolved to be more about love and emotional fulfillment. Before, "when [marriage](https://fee.org/articles/capitalism-and-the-family/) was a necessity for survival, especially for women, the expense and the rarity of divorce were perhaps understandable, even if it worked against women’s best interests in some cases".
1.1.17.3.6.4.2. Con: The recent increase in depression doesn't fail to take into account that some were unhappy in the past. Women should be able to leave abusive marriages. It is possible to make sure they are able to and help men or women leave abusive marriages without eliminating traditional gender roles.
1.1.17.3.7. Pro: There is still a notable gap in how men and women regard the gender-diversity problem.
1.1.17.3.7.1. Pro: In the workplace [men do often disagree](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/moving-mind-sets-on-gender-diversity-mckinsey-global-survey-results) that female executives face more difficulties, e.g. in reaching top management. Therefore they see less value in the diversity initiatives that can correct the gender imbalance.
1.1.17.3.7.1.1. Con: [This study](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/01425451011010096) shows that women appear to plan their careers less than men, as they tend to take a more holistic view of life and pay more attention to their work-life balance. This means that not all women perceive gender imbalance as a problem.
1.1.17.3.7.1.1.1. Con: Just because they view things differently does not mean they don't see the gender imbalance as a problem. It is well known that many women quit their jobs because of sexism and misogyny, especially in fields such as [technology](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/02/21/the_sexism_in_uber_employee_s_report_is_why_women_leave_tech_or_don_t_enter.html). Women unarguably consider this to be a problem.
1.1.17.3.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Unlike many "tech bros" women are [less interested](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-09/as-a-woman-in-tech-i-realized-these-are-not-my-people) in spending their free time with work as well but rather pursue other interests.
1.1.17.3.7.1.2. Pro: Women have greatly benefited from [affirmative action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States#Example_of_success_in_women) legislation. The increase in female CEOs is more likely due to these guidelines than a change in perceptions.
1.1.17.3.7.1.2.1. Con: There are no affirmative action guidelines that force boards of directors to appoint a CEO of a certain gender.
1.1.17.3.7.1.2.1.1. Con: A [new law](http://fortune.com/2016/03/11/germany-board-quota-women/) in Germany says that 30% of supervisory board seats must be filled with women. A higher number of female board members will likely lead to a rise in the promotion of female CEOs.
1.1.17.3.7.1.2.1.1.1. Con: CEOs are chosen by the supervisory board, [not from it](https://hbr.org/1999/05/changing-leaders-the-boards-role-in-ceo-succession-a-roundtable-with-philip-caldwell-george-d-kennedy-g-g-michelson-henry-wendt-and-alfred-m-zeien). [As women and men alike](http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/04/womens-inhumanity-to-women/) can show misogynist attitudes in hiring practices and professional mentorship, an increase of women on the supervisory board does not increase the possibility of women to be elected CEO.
1.1.17.3.7.2. Con: Men not understanding the problem of gender diversity is different from actively perpetuating the patriarchy in order to maintain power.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1. Con: Men experience little direct harm as a result of the current construction of gender, so they have no incentive to develop an understanding of how it harms women. This is likely to lead to them perpetuating the issues \(perhaps passively rather than actively\).
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1. Con: There are a number of ways that fixed gender identities and [patriarchal systems actually hurt men](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/meera-vijayann/the-patriarchy-hurts-men-_b_8615320.html); they are expected to be tough and unemotional, and internalising emotions can lead to them acting out violently.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1. Con: The fact that patriarchy imposes collateral damage on men does not negate the fact that it damages women and other gender non-conforming individuals more.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: [56% of those in poverty are female.](https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/how-does-gender-relate-poverty-status)
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: [91%​ of rape victims are female.](https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf)
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: It is not a stretch to say most victims of unwilling arranged marriages are [female](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_marriage).
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: Even though being emotionally repressed and acting out violently is not psychologically healthy, the recipients of that [violence](http://now.org/resource/violence-against-women-in-the-united-states-statistic/), most likely [women](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/mar/05/violence-against-women-european-union-physical-sexual-abuse), are in an even [worse](http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures) position.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Although most victims of domestic violence are [women](https://now.org/resource/violence-against-women-in-the-united-states-statistic/), the claim that women are the most likely to be the recipients of all male crimes is [false](http://lancasteronline.com/news/most-likely-to-be-a-homicide-victim/article_9f49921a-6e49-5c30-bf31-ed5fe598e01e.html). Males are most likely to be the victims of males. Despite this, the [resources](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/domestic-violence-male-victims-shelters-government-funding-stigma-a7626741.html) for female victims greatly outnumber the resources for male victims. This means the demographic in need is being ignored due to the patriarchal stereotype that men are tough and don't require help, thus perpetuating the cycle of violence and stereotype reinforcement.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Although in the [US homicide](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf) male offenders are more likely to kill other men \(67.8%\), females are murdered by male offenders 21% of times and only 2.2% by other women.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.4.1.2. Con: In the US, females were more likely than males to be the [victim](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf) of intimate killings \(63.7%\) and sex-related homicides \(81.7%\).
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.4.1.2.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: Women are still considered men's property worldwide.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: 35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either [physical and/or sexual](http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures) intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner at some point in their lives.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: 43 per cent of women in the 28 European Union Member States have experienced some form of [psychological violence](http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures) by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.3. Pro: Women still cannot enjoy [full control of their own bodies](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/why-women-are-still-the-property-of-men/news-story/b18f0a4d456db6967e7c05f4f309604f) and personal functions without interference from the government.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Issues related to pregnancy or children are not considered women's business but rather the domain of the public, as is evidenced by [government interference in abortion.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathlyn-and-gay-hendricks/woman-person-or-property-_b_1282620.html)
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.3.1.1. Pro: [Breastfeeding](http://time.com/3060273/world-breastfeeding-week-controversies/) continuously sparks public debates worldwide.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.3.2. Pro: Female desire is taboo in pretty much every culture.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.3.2.1. Pro: The rating or age restrictions placed on movies are [usually higher](https://www.bustle.com/articles/10342-how-pg-13-r-ratings-wage-war-against-women) if they show a woman receiving oral sex compared to a man receiving oral sex.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.3.2.1.1. Pro: This norm has existed for a long time, as this [documentary](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/sep/01/documentary) points out. Not only is female pleasure more likely to get a higher rating than male pleasure, it is also more likely to get a higher rating than violence, including extreme violence against women.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.3.2.2. Pro: The UK has banned the production of pornography depicting female ejaculation since it is deemed an "[unconventional sex act](https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/dec/05/uk-pornography-law-scientific-perspective-children-safety)".
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.3.2.3. Pro: Women are often "[slut-shamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slut-shaming)" for having casual sex, being promiscuous, enjoying sex or showing their bodies.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.3.3. Pro: In a [growing number of countries](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/652842/Burka-Niqab-Islamic-Face-veil-Ban-UK-Fine-France-Belgium-Netherlands-Europe-Muslim-dress), the burka and niqab are banned. In Saudi Arabia and Iran, women [are required to wear](http://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/hijab/) a hijab. Whether prohibition or imposition, in many countries around the world women's bodies are still regulated by state laws.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.4. Pro: At least 200 million women and girls alive today have undergone [female genital mutilation](http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures) in 30 countries.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.5. Pro: Out of the 173 countries studied by the [World Bank](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/sep/09/women-business-and-the-law-2016-getting-to-equal-world-bank-report), 32 require women to get permission from their husbands to apply for a passport, 22 do not allow married mothers to confer citizenship on their children, and 18 allow husbands to dictate whether their wives can work at all.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.6. Pro: Worldwide, more than 700 million women alive today were [married as children](http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures) \(below 18 years of age\).
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.2. Con: Every situation, even beneficial, has its [disadvantages](http://thefifthcolumnnews.com/2016/01/why-i-dont-say-but-patriarchy-hurts-men-too/): patriarchy forces men to be less emotional so they do not empathise with women and, additionally, male emotional repression and lack of vulnerability is a necessary pitfall to maintain male supremacy.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3. Pro: Society gives preferential treatment to women as [82%](http://file.prio.no/Publication_files/Prio/Armed%20Conflict%20Deaths%20Disaggregated%20by%20Gender.pdf) to [98%](http://icasualties.org/OEF/Fatalities.aspx) of US combat deaths are men; [78%](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/Suicide-DataSheet-a.pdf) of US suicide victims are men, [93%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_fatality#Gender) of industrial deaths and accidents in the US are men, [77%](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf) of homicide victims in the US are men and 70-80% of child custody winners are women. Additionally, men get 63% higher sentences than women. Therefore who gets preferential treatment is a contended issue, not a fact.

1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3.3. Pro: Men are imprisoned at [11 times the rate of women.](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/graphs/genderinc.html)
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3.4. Pro: Men make up the vast majority \(generally 90%+\) of the most [hazardous occupations](http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/TopDeaths1.jpg).
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3.4.1. Con: Precisely due to harmful gender stereotypes men are encouraged to be more violent, engage in more [risky](https://books.google.es/books?id=SZWkDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA474&lpg=PA474&dq=97%25+of+combat+death+are+men&source=bl&ots=1g9lSBIBL0&sig=VguvS8RYF9Ii1ce-ZT7xPeOFVDs&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPlqjPxIbXAhXBJFAKHQAEAF04ChDoAQg7MAM#v=onepage&q=driving&f=false) behaviour, carry out more [dangerous](https://books.google.es/books?id=SZWkDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA474&lpg=PA474&dq=97%25+of+combat+death+are+men&source=bl&ots=1g9lSBIBL0&sig=VguvS8RYF9Ii1ce-ZT7xPeOFVDs&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPlqjPxIbXAhXBJFAKHQAEAF04ChDoAQg7MAM#v=onepage&q=driving&f=false) jobs, be responsible for the household finances and be less dedicated to child care and education.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: Women are still more [responsible](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/cathy-meyer/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115.html) for child care than men. While men spend 6.5 hours a week taking part in primary child care activities, women spend on average 12.9 hours. That is why women are given children's custody more often.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: Additionally, 91 percent of child custody after divorce is decided by the parents with no [interference](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/cathy-meyer/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115.html) from the family court system. Among those, in  51% of the cases both parents agreed that the mother should have custody of the children.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: Even though women are more likely to have mental health conditions, including depression, and are also more likely to have suicidal thoughts, male deaths by [suicide](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/21/suicide-gender-men-women-mental-health-nick-clegg) are higher. That is because women tend to use non-violent methods, while men use violent methods, resulting unfortunately in more successful suicide attempts.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3.4.1.3. Pro: In the US, males represented 77% of [homicide](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf) victims yet nearly 90% of offenders.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3.4.1.4. Pro: In the US, women were formally accepted in the [military](http://www.history.org/history/teaching/enewsletter/volume7/images/nov/women_military_timeline.pdf) in 1948 but it was not until 1973 that an all-volunteer military created opportunities for women and women were allowed in combat positions in 1992-1993. Even today, only [16%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_military) graduates at West Point are female, therefore it is only normal that more men die in combat.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3.5. Pro: Males constitute about 93% of [workplace fatalities](http://www.aei.org/publication/equal-pay-day-this-year-is-april-12-the-next-equal-occupational-fatality-day-will-be-in-the-year-2027/).

1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.4. Pro: [Rigid gender roles](http://division51.net/homepage-slider/mens-mental-health-and-gender-role-conflict-a-call-to-action/) in relationships lead men to have depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, negative attitudes toward seeking help, self-disclosure, shame and guilt, feeling discriminated against, body image/muscularity concerns, alcohol and substance abuse, and attachment and bonding issues.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.5. Pro: There continues to be a strong [social bias](http://fusion.net/story/352521/in-defense-of-feminine-men/) against men who are viewed as feminine.
1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: As feminine traits are seen as less valuable, men who challenge stereotypes and acquire traits traditionally perceived as feminine are treated worse. Patriarchy supports male dominance and punishes those men who are seen as diminishing their status.
1.1.17.3.8. Pro: Gender roles are perpetuated through several cultural and social practices.
1.1.17.3.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.4.
1.1.17.3.8.2. Pro: Gender stereotypes are reinforced and perpetuated through social institutions such as [media](http://krytyka.org/gender-stereotypes-in-mass-media-case-study-analysis-of-the-gender-stereotyping-phenomenon-in-tv-commercials/) and [educational establishments](https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2013/dec/09/gender-stereotypes-schools-children-choices) in order to make gender norms appear natural.
1.1.17.3.8.2.1. Pro: [In some cases,](https://www.thoughtco.com/gender-definition-3026335) students are sent home or excluded from school functions for wearing clothing that is not perceived as normal for their gender, e.g. boys in skirts, or girls wearing tuxes to prom.
1.1.17.3.8.3. Pro: Even some forms of transgender therapy, such as behavior change programs which help children in personal distress from social ostracism, [enforce gender conformity](http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/pub/eres/SOC217_PIMENTEL/frable.pdf).
1.1.17.3.8.4. Pro: [Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_and_gender#cite_note-Lakoff.2C_R._1975-7) often reproduces social norms and conventions attached to gender.
1.1.17.3.8.4.1. Pro: In so far as language is a social construct, and some languages have names for more than two genders, then gender should be considered a social construct that is deeply influenced by the language/terminology of gender identity.
1.1.17.3.8.4.1.1. Pro: This idea is strengthened by the observation that some words do not, and cannot, have absolute meaning. For example, "masculine" and "feminine."
1.1.17.3.8.4.2. Pro: Language [has a great influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender) on how humans perceive reality, thus it's considered the building block of culture by social constructionism.
1.1.17.3.8.4.3. Pro: [Robin Lakoff](https://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist156/Lakoff_1973.pdf) extensively wrote on the existence of a specific "women's [register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_\(sociolinguistics\))" serving to maintain women's subdued role in society.
1.1.17.3.8.4.3.1. Pro: [Genderlect](http://changingminds.org/explanations/gender/genderlect.htm) does exist.
1.1.17.3.9. Pro: The patriarchal family is still [incredibly prevalent](http://organizingchange.org/patriarchy-persists-can-change/) and translates into a perpetuation of patriarchy at all levels of society, especially considering that the family is an [arena of power and politics](http://www.dlprog.org/opinions/gender-and-power-six-links-and-one-big-opportunity.php) that shapes power relations in society.
1.1.17.3.9.1. Pro: Religions, including the [Catholic church](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/opinion/frank-bruni-catholicism-undervalues-women.html?_r=0), have done exceptional jobs of perpetuating the patriarchal family structure through their literature, preaching and practice.
1.1.17.3.9.1.1. Pro: One of the Ten Commandments presupposes the tiered, heteronormativism where women are more property than person, with "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife."
1.1.17.3.9.1.2. Pro: The triple talaq, "[undisputed](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/egyptian-clerics-support-for-triple-talaq-may-embolden-such-voices-in-india/articleshow/57261315.cms)" within Islam, means a man can verbally divorce his wife, no questions asked, by saying talaq three times. The wife has no such right.
1.1.17.3.9.1.3. Pro: In Hindu tradition, if a husband were to die, the wife would be expected to commit "sati", and throw herself onto her dead husband's funeral pyre, because without him her life would be meaningless.
1.1.17.3.10. Pro: Globally, [90 percent of heads of state are men](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/aschoff-socialism-feminism-clinton-sandberg-class-race-wage-gap-care-work-labor/), and at the 2015 World Economic Forum only 17 percent of the 2,500 representatives present were women.
1.1.17.3.10.1. Con: Gender parity in any workplace or political sphere does indicate a beneficial result/outcome. Women must be left to their own personal agency in order for them to achieve success, rather than be "given" success or "gotten into" a successful role.
1.1.17.3.10.2. Pro: Less than 10% of [executive directors](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/29/women-in-uk-boardrooms-executive-directors-ftse-100-companies) at FTSE 100 companies are women.
1.1.17.3.10.3. Pro: In the [US](http://www.npr.org/2016/06/11/481424890/even-with-a-female-presumptive-nominee-women-are-underrepresented-in-politics), women make up around 19 percent of all members of Congress and less than 25 percent of all state legislators. They also make up six of the nation's 50 governors, or 12 percent.
1.1.17.3.11. Pro: Patriarchy is generally not an [explicit](http://organizingchange.org/patriarchy-persists-can-change/) ongoing effort by men to dominate women. It is rather a long-standing system that we are born into and that the majority of people of all gender identities perpetuate unconsciously.
1.1.17.3.11.1. Pro: The idea of [hegemonic masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemonic_masculinity) is defined as the current practice of heteropatriarchy that legitimizes men's dominant position in society and justifies the subordination of women, trans people and other marginalized ways of being a man.
1.1.17.3.11.1.1. Pro: [Judith Halberstam](http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/gustafson/FILM%20165A.W11/film%20165A%5BW11%5D%20readings%20/halbertsammasculinity.pdf)'s research has revealed how heroic masculinity is constructed as dominant and how residual masculinities that do not fit that model become alternative/subordinate.
1.1.17.3.11.1.1.1. Pro: At the same time, hegemonic femininity cannot exist as femininity is understood as [a lack of masculinity](https://books.google.es/books?hl=it&lr=&id=As563HBuZcAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&ots=EmrGtiZ8UU&sig=Bj1V6ajnL206-eVFeNDytMBX8Yg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false). Being in a hegemonic position is about being in a position of power, and power is [inherent in hegemonic masculinity.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540250600667785?src=recsys)
1.1.17.3.11.1.2. Con: The concept of hegemonic masculinity as a fixed character-type [has been criticized](http://etnologia.uw.edu.pl/sites/default/files/hegemonic_masculinity_connell_and_messerschmidt.pdf) for being analytically limited, because it excludes the complexity of different and competing forms of masculinity.
1.1.17.3.11.1.3. Pro: The concept of [toxic masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_masculinity) critiques the assumptions and expectations of men as dominant, violent, unemotional, and sexually aggressive.
1.1.17.3.11.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.4.
1.1.17.3.11.1.3.2. Pro: In her book, [C.J. Pascoe](http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520271487) showed through over a year's worth of research how boys are socialized to adopt and perform a dominant, aggressive, controlling, and sexualized version of masculinity, and how their status in society and inclusion in the category "men" depends upon it.
1.1.17.3.11.2. Pro: One example of unconsciously perpetuating patriarchy is the use of the generic pronoun ["he"](https://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist156/Gastil_1990.pdf) based on grammatical convention.
1.1.17.3.11.2.1. Con: This usage is outdated. A 2002 [study](http://americanspeech.dukejournals.org/content/91/1/62) found that 79% of participants use gender inclusive language \("he or she"\), and 68% use singular "they", which is widely used as a gender-neutral pronoun in contemporary English.
1.1.17.3.11.3. Pro: [Micromachismos](http://carmelo.elaptopcomputer.com/what-are-micromachismos/) are naturalized, legitimized sexist behaviors settled in people's conception of relationships and still not fully delegitimized, e.g. men driving the car or controlling household expenses.
1.1.17.3.11.4. Pro: [Foucault argues](https://www.powercube.net/other-forms-of-power/foucault-power-is-everywhere/) that there are 'regimes of truth', or 'general politics', rather than a group of people, which invisibly govern our behavior and maintain the status quo.
1.1.17.3.12. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.
1.1.17.3.13. Con: Patriarchy is a division of social roles based on natural biological gender differences.
1.1.17.3.13.1. Pro: Men are naturally more powerful than women.
1.1.17.3.13.1.1. Con: "Powerful," is an undefined, relative, and ambiguous term. There are many types of power applicable in different arenas, and gained through different skills, traits, or experiences. The different types of power are not comparable in any meaningful way. One may be powerfully muscled, and another may be powerful in social influence. A third may be financially powerful. None of those are applicable in a game of chess, and in a societal sense, their utility varies depending on strategy.
1.1.17.3.13.1.2. Pro: Men's brains operate differently than women's, which makes men generally better suited to assert power or to rule.
1.1.17.3.13.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.
1.1.17.3.13.1.2.2. Con: [Researchers](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/nov/30/brain-sex-men-from-mars-women-venus-not-so-says-new-study) found that there is no sharp division between male and female brains. Although there are some brain characteristics that are a bit more common in a sex or another, we are all a mixture of these, and [it is brain type](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/03/biology-sexist-gender-stereotypes), not sex, which predicts people's behavior.
1.1.17.3.13.1.2.2.1. Con: Stanford Medicine published an article about this last spring. Research and studies consistently demonstrate that male and female brains are different. While there are biological differences culture can reinforce and intensify these differences. This question is almost too broad because while gender seems to be biological, gender roles, gender expectations and gender equality are social constructs.[The Cognitive Differences Between Men and Women](https://stanmed.stanford.edu/2017spring/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different.html)
1.1.17.3.13.1.2.3. Con: [Being told they are bad](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/03/07/the-truth-about-gender-and-math/) at certain skills, not biology, is what makes women perform poorly when tested on these skills.
1.1.17.3.13.1.2.3.1. Pro: In a recent study, gender differences in spatial reasoning skills were reduced [beyond statistical significance](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/picture-yourself-as-a-stereotypical-male) when women were primed to think of themselves as men.
1.1.17.3.13.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.10.6.2.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3. Pro: Men have greater responsibilities because they are physically stronger than women.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.1. Pro: There is scientific proof that men are stronger than women on average. For example, [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8477683) about gender shows the differences in strength and muscle fiber characteristics.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.1.1. Con: While there may be physical differences between the average man and the average woman, there is significant overlap between the two genders \(e.g. in [running speed](http://www.warandgender.com/wggendif.htm)\). This means that differences between individuals are much less significant than averages imply.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Men hold nearly all records for physical [strength](http://www.iwf.net/results/olympic-records/) and [speed](https://www.iaaf.org/records/by-category/olympic-games-records).
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.1.1.2. Con: If a task requires an above-average amount of strength or speed, the position will be filled by an individual in the upper percentile of strength or speed and will disproportionately consist of males \(i.e. professional athletes, [coal miners](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=24&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiD_MHX8-3WAhWIKCYKHYv_C2I4FBAWCDowAw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chamberofmines.org.za%2Findustry-news%2Fpublications%2Ffact-sheets%2Fsend%2F3-fact-sheets%2F424-women-in-mining&usg=AOvVaw1ucQEfPdyyZANkGRnTPwfw), lumberjacks, [firefighters](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/03/nyregion/despite-recruiting-few-women-do-well-in-firefighter-tests.html)\).
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.1.1.3. Con: Running speed is seldom a trait important in labor. Thus irrelevant in the division of labor.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.1.1.4. Con: Professional [women’s soccer](http://www.newsleader.com/story/sports/2016/05/04/soca-u-15-boys-sparkle-win-over-us-womens-u-23-team/83934264/) teams [regularly](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3609949/Matildas-lose-7-0-Newcastle-Jets-15s-Rio-Olympics-warm-up.html) [practice against and lose](https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/a-dallas-fc-under-15-boys-squad-beat-the-u-s-womens-national-team-in-a-scrimmage/) to high school \(and younger\) boys teams. \([Bonus source from Sweden](https://www.thelocal.se/20130116/45646#.UPbSTKFQAkC)\)
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: Professional national women's soccer may lose to younger male soccer clubs in part due to a difference in speed.  Although women run nearly as far as men in a regular match \(9.1 km for women / 10.2 for men\) [women are only 2/3 as fast](https://www.tz.de/sport/fussball/frauen-maenner-fussball-gross-unterschied-wirklich-1296331.html) as men.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.2. Con: Once a country develops to a certain stage, biological differences become far less relevant, both in the production of goods and societal hierarchy.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.2.1. Con: This does not falsify gender hierarchies in past societies.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.2.2. Pro: In several developed countries, not only do employers offer maternity leave, but also paternity leave. This breaks down the traditional idea that the father becomes the breadwinner and the mother the caregiver.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Maternity and paternity leave are social constructs and the quantitative and qualitative necessity of both are vastly different based on who was the one giving birth \(biological sex\).  The physical necessity and optimum length of leave is not the same for females and males. \(i.e. recovering from childbirth, pregnancy complications, morning sickness\).
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.2.3. Pro: Biological differences have stopped being significant since the Industrial Revolution.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: At a certain level of agriculture, the grunt work is handled by machinery, making the physical strength of the operator irrelevant.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.2.3.2. Pro: Assembly lines show that physical strength is not necessarily an advantage in production. A woman could, for example, bolt a dashboard into a car as easily as a man.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.2.4. Con: In China, the gender gap in labour participation is biggest and [has been increasing](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/opinion/global/chinas-entrenched-gender-gap.html) in the most developed parts of the country.
1.1.17.3.13.1.3.2.4.1. Con: This is not because of any difference between the biological capacity of men and women to carry out jobs. Rather, it is because of traditional outlooks on gender, including, as the article mentions, an active propaganda war carried out by the Chinese government against 'leftover women'.
1.1.17.3.13.1.4. Pro: Men are more likely than women to engage in dominant or aggressive behaviors, to[initiate negotiations](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/cfawis/bowles.pdf), and to [self select into competitive](https://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/BNO.QJE.pdf) environments.
1.1.17.3.13.1.4.1. Pro: Men are [more motivated by power](https://hbr.org/2015/09/explaining-gender-differences-at-the-top) than women, who tend to be more motivated by affiliation \(the desire for close relationships with others\).
1.1.17.3.13.1.4.1.1. Con: This assumption has been called "[benevolent sexism](https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/mar/25/forget-flexibility-what-working-women-really-want-is-power)". [Research](http://www.talentinnovation.org/_private/assets/WomenWant%20FiveThings_ExecSumm-CTI.pdf) shows that women are intensely ambitious and strive for power in their workplace and careers. However, they are often at a disadvantage because employers expect them to choose children or family over their work.
1.1.17.3.13.1.4.2. Con: This tends to be the case because boys are socialised into behaving this way, whereas girls are socialised into believing that they need to be passive, quiet, and timid.
1.1.17.3.13.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.11.1.3.
1.1.17.3.13.1.5. Con: Women are better suited to leadership than men are. This is not because of any intrinsic biological trait, but rather because the traits they are socialised into adopting are more conducive to good leadership.
1.1.17.3.13.1.5.1. Pro: Men are seen as more confident, which is different from competent. Unfortunately, the two things are often [conflated](https://hbr.org/2013/08/why-do-so-many-incompetent-men), leading to an inaccurate perception that men are more powerful than women.
1.1.17.3.13.1.5.1.1. Pro: Men are [consistently](http://www.hoganassessments.com/assessment/hogan-development-survey/) more arrogant, manipulative and risk-prone than women, attributes that often get mistaken for confidence and leadership ability.
1.1.17.3.13.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Paradoxically, what is seen as needed to get to the top of a profession, is not what is actually required to do the job well. In fact, being arrogant and manipulative often leads to the downfall of managers and senior members within businesses.
1.1.17.3.13.1.5.2. Pro: People who are [humble](https://hbr.org/2005/07/level-5-leadership-the-triumph-of-humility-and-fierce-resolve) make better leaders. This attribute is much more [common](http://www.npr.org/2015/09/08/438473573/why-are-women-less-likely-to-become-entrepreneurs-than-men) in women than it is in men.
1.1.17.3.13.1.5.3. Pro: Women are more likely to adopt more [effective leadership strategies](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=2003-06077-007) than men. Female managers are [more likely to](https://hbr.org/2013/08/why-do-so-many-incompetent-men) elicit respect and pride from their followers, communicate their vision effectively, empower and mentor subordinates, and approach problem-solving in a more flexible and creative way.
1.1.17.3.13.1.6. Con: [Women are powerful](https://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/#tab:overall) in a diverse number of fields. The claim that men are naturally more powerful is just factually incorrect.
1.1.17.3.13.1.6.1. Con: Men have been conditioned through evolution to take on leadership and protective roles, as evidenced by the social dynamics of early agrarian societies.[\[Mark Manson - What's the Problem with Men?\]](https://markmanson.net/whats-the-problem-with-men)
1.1.17.3.13.1.6.2. Pro: While still low, the number of female CEO's is [increasing](http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/29/investing/female-ceos-record-high/). This increase shows how the traditional perception of men as leaders is eroding.
1.1.17.3.13.1.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.7.1.2.
1.1.17.3.13.1.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.10.2.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7. Con: Society gives preferential treatment to men and contributes to them being more powerful than women \(through higher salaries or by giving them more educational opportunities\).
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.2. Pro: Men tend to think that they are smarter than women, but there is no actual difference in intelligence levels [\(von Stumm et al., p 431\)](http://www.drtomascp.com/uploads/DecomposingSEI12Countries_BJP_2009.pdf). This indicates a higher degree of arrogance and over-confidence, attributes that have nothing to do with being a better leader or being better than women.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.3. Pro: Women [outperform men in higher education](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/aschoff-socialism-feminism-clinton-sandberg-class-race-wage-gap-care-work-labor/), but they don’t achieve comparable levels of success or wealth.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.3.1. Pro: In the US, women still only make, on average, [78 cents to the dollar](http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/equal-pay-day-2015/) in comparison to men.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.4. Pro: Girls are still less likely than boys to even start secondary education in [Western, Eastern and Middle Africa and Southern Asia](https://www.oecd.org/employment/50423364.pdf).
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.5. Pro: Women are still [underrepresented](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.201600035/full) in the so-called “hard” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \(STEM\). They are paid less, promoted less, and win fewer grants than similarly qualified men. Female scientists are also more likely to be assigned to jobs for which there is less recognition.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.5.1. Con: There is [some evidence](http://web.missouri.edu/~gearyd/files/Halpernetal2007PsychScience.pdf) that success in STEM fields is also influenced by biological factors.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.2.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.5.2. Con: If that is indeed the case, it is the individual's fault for listening to others and ignoring their desires. Modern society [fast tracks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/14/study-finds-surprisingly-that-women-are-favored-for-jobs-in-stem/?utm_term=.31a4e6c573f7) women in academia and STEM. There are no social road blocks for women other than themselves.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.5.3. Con: The gender wage gap is a long [debunked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyFjPHwF6To) myth.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.5.4. Con: It is unclear that this is based on societal constraints.  Statistics show that the more gender equity a country has, the [fewer female STEM graduates](https://www.aei.org/publication/the-global-educational-gender-equality-paradox-the-more-gender-equality-in-a-country-the-fewer-women-in-stem/) there are.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.6. Pro: [A research study](https://www.thoughtco.com/racial-and-gender-bias-among-professors-3026672) documented that women are less likely than men to receive responses from university professors after emailing to express interest in working with them, showing the existence of a clear gender bias in the university.
1.1.17.3.13.1.7.7. Pro: Student evaluations are [systematically biased against women](https://www.thoughtco.com/sexist-problem-with-student-evaluations-3026673). Students in general show more respect for male faculty members than women, who are are expected to do and give more in order to be viewed positively by students.
1.1.17.3.13.1.8. Con: This is a social perception. [Research](http://www.unife.it/progetto/equality-and-diversity/genere/il-genere-in-ateneo/allegati/Gender%20Stereotypes%20Are%20Alive-%20Well-%20and%20Busy%20Producing%20Workplace%20Discrimination.pdf) found that women encounter greater challenges to or skepticism of their ideas and abilities at work because people view them as less competent than men and lacking in leadership potential.
1.1.17.3.13.1.8.1. Pro: Women are socialized toward a gender role that is more passive, private, rule-abiding, and compassionate, while men are oriented toward leadership, public roles, autonomy and self-reliance. [This socialization contributes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852527/) to women’s lower levels of political engagement.
1.1.17.3.13.1.9. Pro: Men are [more politically engaged](http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-political-participation/facts-and-figures) than women.
1.1.17.3.13.1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.10.
1.1.17.3.13.1.9.2. Con: Women's low political participation is the result of wider [societal gender inequalities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852527/) such as education and salary, not of natural masculine power.
1.1.17.3.13.1.9.2.1. Pro: Women are less likely to engage in politics because of their lower access to socio-economic resources. For example, men are far more likely to be employed full-time than women, and [employment is positively related to political participation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852527/).
1.1.17.3.13.1.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.13.1.8.1.
1.1.17.3.13.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.16.
1.1.18. Con: While a person's sex is determined by chromosomes, organs, hormones, etc., their gender is determined by the cultural meanings that are often inscribed to a particular sex.
1.1.18.1. Pro: Sex and gender must at a minimum be different concepts. This can be seen from the fact that many people with male sexual characteristics adopt female-gendered behavior. If sex and gender were identical, wearing a dress \(a female-gendered  action\) and having a penis \(a male sexual characteristic\) would be logically incompatible. But we know there are people who have penises \(have a male sex\) and wear dresses \(female gender\). Ergo, sex and gender must be different concepts.
1.1.18.1.1. Con: The developing understanding of gender as a [spectrum](https://www.genderspectrum.org/quick-links/understanding-gender/), rather than a binary, shows the evolution of gender as a social construct.
1.1.18.1.1.1. Pro: Gender can be viewed as an absolute \(male/female\) or a more fluid \(spectrum\) construct. Those who view it as an absolute do so because of their beliefs. Those who view it as a spectrum do so because of their beliefs. This difference in beliefs is the result of different social constructs.
1.1.18.1.1.2. Pro: In places like [Sweden](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-14038419), gender neutral socialisation is being promoted in some pre schools to provide kids with the option of expressing themselves fully rather than within the binary.
1.1.18.1.1.3. Pro: Many cultures are introducing gender neutral pronouns such as the singular [They](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/gender-neutral-pronouns-when-they-doesnt-identify-as-either-male-or-female/2014/10/27/41965f5e-5ac0-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67_story.html?utm_term=.5ef0c598e219), [Mx](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/03/insider/mx-did-the-times-adopt-a-new-transgender-courtesy-title.html?_r=0)., [Hen](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/03/27/395785965/he-she-or-hen-sweden-s-new-gender-neutral-pronoun), [Ze and Zir](https://genderneutralpronoun.wordpress.com/tag/ze-and-zir/).
1.1.18.1.1.3.1. Con: How we refer to concepts does not change the concept itself.
1.1.18.1.1.3.1.1. Con: The power to name is the power to create new concepts.
1.1.18.1.1.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.8.4.
1.1.18.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.
1.1.18.1.1.5. Pro: The very fact that many people now identify as gender non-conforming shows the ability of people to have a gender identity outside of the binary.
1.1.18.1.1.6. Con: The existence of a spectrum does not mean gender is constructed. It is possible that gender may be inherent to individuals but be broader than just being masculine or feminine.
1.1.18.1.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.4.
1.1.18.1.1.7. Con: The idea that for some people gender is a spectrum[just does not logically stand up.](https://aeon.co/essays/the-idea-that-gender-is-a-spectrum-is-a-new-gender-prison) In fact, if gender was a spectrum it would be a continuum between two extremes \(masculinity and femininity\) and everyone would be located somewhere along that continuum, as nobody is pure masculinity or femininity.
1.1.18.1.1.7.1. Pro: People insisting that they are non-binary are creating a false binary between those who conform to the gender norms associated with their sex, and those who do not. In reality, [we are all non-binary.](https://aeon.co/essays/the-idea-that-gender-is-a-spectrum-is-a-new-gender-prison)
1.1.18.1.1.7.1.1. Pro: Being transgender [has nothing to do](https://aeon.co/essays/the-idea-that-gender-is-a-spectrum-is-a-new-gender-prison) with a desire to change one's sexed body. A person is transgender when they identify as a gender that does not align with the one they have been assigned at birth and which society assigns them in daily interactions.
1.1.18.1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: Gender is not a spectrum, because it’s not an innate, internal essence or property, but rather a social construction.
1.1.18.1.1.7.2. Con: Feminity and masculinity are defined in opposition to each other and considered exclusive categories by most of society. Given this, it is actually unlikely that extremes of a gender spectrum would respond to masculinity and feminity as we understand them today.
1.1.18.1.1.7.2.1. Pro: The widespread existence of only female and only male toilets shows that the two genders are considered exclusive categories worldwide.
1.1.18.1.1.8. Pro: [New York City](https://heatst.com/culture-wars/here-are-the-31-gender-identities-new-york-city-recognizes/) officially recognizes at least 31 gender identities.
1.1.18.1.1.9. Pro: In 2014, [Facebook](http://techland.time.com/2014/02/14/a-comprehensive-guide-to-facebooks-new-options-for-gender-identity/) added dozens of new gender identities users could specify on their profiles. In 2015 users could specify an [unlimited](https://www.facebook.com/facebookdiversity/posts/774221582674346) number of identities.
1.1.18.1.1.10. Pro: The simple fact that we can change our conception of gender means that it is a social construct.
1.1.18.2. Pro: Gender regards masculinity or femininity. In Western culture it may be considered 'masculine' to be muscular, but we know that females can have the biological predisposition to be more muscular than some males. Such a female may be considered less 'feminine' because of her muscular size, but it was a biologically determined expression. Biology has the ability to determine physical sexual expression, but the expression of masculine or feminine is interpreted by society.
1.1.18.3. Con: It is impossible to determine all persons' sex by looking at chromosomes, organs, and hormones. There is a wide spectrum of [intersex variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex) among humans and there are also examples of intersex variations from the animal kingdom.
1.1.18.3.1. Pro: The [total number](http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency) of people whose bodies differ from standard male or female is one in 100 births.
1.1.18.3.1.1. Con: 99% are clearly identifiable as male or female. Therefore these are good categories.
1.1.18.3.2. Pro: There is a hazy basis for biological sex, but even that is complicated. Roughly [1.7% of the world's population](http://oii-usa.org/2563/how-common-is-intersex-in-humans/) is born intersex, or a mix of male and female biologically. Some individuals don't even know they were born intersex until their parents tell them they had cosmetic surgery.
1.1.18.3.2.1. Con: For 99.7% of people, their gender identity correlates with their biological sex.  The data fits the model of a bi-modal distribution with a mere 0.3% as outliers. This is statistically significant, pointing towards biology as the determining factor and not an arbitrary choice made by individuals.
1.1.18.3.2.2. Pro: 60% of intersex people end up having medical treatment interventions related to their intersex variation, half of which happen before they turn18. Additionally 42% of intersex people above 16 think about self harm, with 26% of intersex people above 16 engaging in self harm due to dissatisfaction with their biological sex not lining up with their identifying gender. [LGBTI Health Statistics](http://lgbtihealth.org.au/statistics/)
1.1.18.3.2.3. Con: That is an unqualified statement encompassing a wide range of phenomena. If we look at the cases where chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female, the ratio is around 0.018%. [tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224490209552139)
1.1.18.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.18.1.1.
1.1.18.4. Pro: It has been argued that [gender is something we 'do'](http://creativesociology.blogspot.co.nz/2011/08/doing-gender.html) and the way we do gender is actively constructed through social interactions and gender scripts.
1.1.18.4.1. Pro: Gender scripts are developed to teach people how to portray a particular gender. For example, from a young age little girls are exposed to princesses and the colour pink as things they should like through TV, the media, and in stores.
1.1.18.4.1.1. Pro: Gender scripts are used in marketing to appeal to both genders such as in the [marketing](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5685&context=etd) of jeans and razors for both men and women.
1.1.18.4.1.2. Pro: The pink for girls/ blue for boys script in the Western world, for instance, is [fairly new](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-did-girls-start-wearing-pink-1370097/): at least until 1918 pink was considered a more "decisive" color, i.e. better suited for boys. In the 1940s customer preferences had started to change and retailers marketed more pink clothing for girls; it took until the heightened consumerism of the 1980s and a subsequent hype in individual merchandise for the color to be firmly established as "girly".
1.1.18.4.1.2.1. Pro: The gender idea of "pink for girls" applies only to certain \(Western\) cultures. In many [parts](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/smartertravel/what-colors-mean-in-other_b_9078674.html) of the world there is no feminine [connotation](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2012/06/color-and-cultural-design-considerations/) to wearing [pink](http://www.empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com/cultural-color.html).
1.1.18.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: In the Indian states of Punjab and Rajasthan, for example – both very patriarchal, macho cultures – pink is a [common colour](https://www.quora.com/What-does-pink-symbolize-in-different-cultures) for men's attire.
1.1.18.4.1.3. Pro: [Sexual scripts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3515716/) have developed in a gendered way. These cultural scripts teach men to believe they should be more sexually assertive and that sex will give them status, while sexual scripts for women teach them to be more cautious about sex and that their virginity is tied to their worth.
1.1.18.4.1.3.1. Pro: The culture surrounding [virginity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purity_Myth) pledges and purity balls is aimed almost exclusively at young women.
1.1.18.4.2. Con: Many people would argue that they are unaware of the ways they 'do' or 'perform' gender, and conclude that they way they perform gender is natural.
1.1.18.4.2.1. Con: Gender is deeply woven into our understanding of the world and society, so people may not be aware of the gendered behaviour they have been taught since birth. It does not mean those ideas are not constructed.
1.1.18.4.3. Pro: The [theory of gender as performative](http://lauragonzalez.com/TC/BUTLER_gender_trouble.pdf) argues that what we perceive as gender roles is created through repetitive performance of certain models, that then become the norm we are expected to live by.
1.1.18.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.16.1.
1.1.18.4.3.2. Pro: Through exaggeration and parody, drag shows us how performances of gender are imitative, not just in drag but also in everyday life. \([Salih, p. 57](http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Salih-Butler-Performativity-Chapter_3.pdf)\)
1.1.18.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.4.2.
1.1.18.5. Con: Female and male "gender" or sexual identities are determined by both biological and cultural factors, in complex interplay. The current use of the "gender" concept decouples sexual identity from biology.
1.1.18.5.1. Pro: Whereas Judith Butler's \(et al.\) theories have instituted a separation between "gender" and "sex", [American psychiatrist Robert Stoller's research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stoller) bridges that gap. His study of gender identity formation in early childhood attests to the biological and cultural determinants that shape human identity.
1.1.18.6. Con: The idea that there is a "biological sex" \(meaning XX/XY chromosomes, certain hormone levels\) is also a social construct.
1.1.18.6.1. Pro: There are many [non-XX/XY combinations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sex_chromosome_aneuploidies)
1.1.18.6.1.1. Con: While there are several variants, the biological categories of male, female, and intersex are useful enough to cover almost all if not all cases.
1.1.18.6.1.2. Con: These combinations of X and Y chromosomes are the result of genetic mutations and therefore statistically unusual, to say the least. The vast majority of people have either a set of XX or XY chromosomes, as it corresponds to the unmutated genetic coding.
1.1.18.6.1.2.1. Con: [Sexual reproduction is itself a mutation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction)
1.1.18.6.1.2.1.1. Con: While mutation is an essential part of development of fetusses, there is a difference between [healthy mutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover), which ensure a diverse gene pool, and unhealthy mutations, which cause occurances of genetic disorders.
1.1.18.6.1.2.1.1.1. Con: There is no provided evidence that the discussed mutations belong in either group.
1.1.18.6.1.3. Pro: People can be born with chromosomal pairings other than XX or XY, such as XO, XXY, or XXX. If gender were determined by biological sex, 2 genders would not suffice for these abnormalities.
1.1.18.6.2. Pro: There is diversity among people with XY chromosomes, such as individuals with [AIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome) \(Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome\).
1.1.18.6.3. Con: The notion of sex chromosomes can be used in social conditioning of gender, but it is a biological difference in humans, not a social construct.
1.1.18.6.3.1. Con: Individuals with [AIS](http://www.isna.org/faq/conditions/ais) \(Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome\) have a 46, XY karyotype, are born with genitals of normative female appearance, have a vagina, and develop breasts in puberty. It would be illogical to categorize them as male based on their chromosomal status.
1.1.18.6.3.1.1. Con: While we may not be able to classify all individuals, this does not mean that no classifications can be made. Phenotype differences doesn't negate the fact that  chromosomes present distinct physical differences and have some accuracy for most people.
1.1.18.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Most of us never learn our chromosome status. You could have [45,X/46,XY mosaicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45,X/46,XY_mosaicism) with a male or female phenotype and never know.
1.1.18.6.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Even if most people do not know their chromosomes, these disorders are [rare](https://www2.palomar.edu/anthro/abnormal/abnormal_5.htm), therefore for most people their chromosomes are within the norm and in accordance with their physiology.
1.1.18.6.4. Con: It might be a construct that there are only two biological sexes, but that doesn't lead to the conclusion that biological sex in general is a social construct.
1.1.18.6.4.1. Con: Sex is constructed with reference to biological traits, but the categories \(i.e. different sexes\) assigned to these traits are defined and constructed by society.
1.1.18.6.5. Pro: Generally, "biological sex" is assigned by a doctor at birth.
1.1.18.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.6.3.1.1.1.
1.1.18.6.5.2. Con: Biological sex is recognized by a doctor at birth, not assigned.
1.1.18.6.6. Pro: The International Association of Athletics Federation \(IAAF\) introduced new rules regarding female athletes with [hyperandrogenism](https://www.iaaf.org/news/iaaf-news/iaaf-to-introduce-eligibility-rules-for-femal-1). Female athletes must undergo tests to show their testosterone levels are lower than male athletes' levels.
1.1.18.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.5.1.1.
1.1.18.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.1.1.
1.1.18.8. Con: Powerful social forces may help construct how children and adults express their gender, but anthropologists and biologists claim that biological factors [strongly contribute](http://www.livinganthropologically.com/2012/05/16/anthropology-sex-gender-sexuality-social-constructions/) to who we are.
1.1.18.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.
1.1.18.8.2. Pro: The biological factor of being XX or XY makes you female or male, thus feminine or masculine.
1.1.18.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.18.3.
1.1.18.8.2.2. Pro: The mechanism that determines embryo’s genetic sex depends on a complex interplay of genetic, psychological, social and, naturally, hormonal factors. The chief hormonal factor is the influence of [testosterone](http://healthdoctrine.com/hormones-factors-in-fetus-gender-and-child-future-development/) in the womb.
1.1.18.8.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.18.6.
1.1.18.9. Pro: Gender is referred to as roles, behaviours, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women, so it must be socially constructed.
1.1.18.9.1. Con: Just because society considers them appropriate, does not mean that society made them.
1.1.18.9.2. Pro: One can observe a multitude of biological differences between 'males' and 'females'. However, the terms 'men' and 'women' not only refer to their commonly associated biological sexes, but also to a set of intricate and deeply conditioned social roles, expressions, presumptions and expectations respectively. Such interweaving of biology and presumed social representation causes unfounded judgements of individuals through a socially constructed interpretation of their biologically assigned sex.
1.1.18.9.3. Con: Gender is determined biologically and psychologically, but gender-expression \(what are considered masculine or feminine behaviour/traits\) is a social construct.
1.1.18.10. Con: The animal kingdom shows that mammals and other animals exhibit sex specific behaviour and roles without any existence of societal structures of class, race, etc., found in the human world.
1.1.18.10.1. Pro: Male and female roles/genders are [strongly bounded](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1500983.full) to sexes in the animal kingdom. Higher intelligence has risen to question this predisposition, and demanded the freedom to go against it, but shouldn't deny it to be a driving force in societies.
1.1.18.10.2. Pro: Humans are animals as well, they belong to the family of the [great apes \(hominids\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae).
1.1.18.10.2.1. Con: The fact that we fit into the same group as other animals is irrelevant. We go beyond that. Example: All mammals are not subject to the same processes. All carbon based life forms are not subject to the same processes.
1.1.18.10.3. Con: Humans have rational capacity that animals do not, thus they do not operate solely by biological conditioning.
1.1.18.10.3.1. Con: While humans hold a rational capacity that can overrule our intrinsic biological structures, we're not detached from the physiological consequences of a faulty rational decision.
1.1.18.10.3.2. Pro: Unlike animals we change our behavior in response to moral, political, or accidental factors.
1.1.18.10.3.3. Pro: Influential philosophers like [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason#Classical_philosophy) or [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant#Anthropology) prescribe that the humans' special characteristic is the capability to reason.
1.1.18.10.4. Con: The sex behaviour of many species of animals is determined [entirely by environmental circumstances](https://theconversation.com/when-do-children-develop-their-gender-identity-56480) and not by their biology.
1.1.18.10.4.1. Con: Some animals are hermaphrodite \([slugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug#Reproduction)\) and both individuals are fertilized when mating. Their sex behaviors are exclusively determined by [biological factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating_of_gastropods#Gender_strategy) as there are no sex differences that can be environmentally influenced.
1.1.18.10.4.1.1. Con: This true for slugs, but some animals shift gender as is required by their environment. [Common Reed Frog.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_reed_frog)
1.1.18.10.4.2. Con: Most animals' sex is entirely determined by biology [very early in development](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/genetic-mechanisms-of-sex-determination-314). Even when the environment is a factor it is very early on \(egg incubation\); it's not something that can be easily changed later on.
1.1.18.10.4.3. Pro: Alligators, crocodiles, turtles and some lizards don’t have sex chromosomes: their sex is simply [determined by the temperature](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-temperature-sex-determination-reptiles/) of their nest during incubation.
1.1.18.10.4.3.1. Con: While this is true, this is not sex-linked behavior. For example, male alligators extend their hunting range twice as far as females. Also, female turtles will sometimes dig nests even when they have no eggs to lay. These are sex-linked behaviors, and they are outside of possible cultural influence.
1.2. Con: Most cultures divide labor between men and women, thus at least some aspects of gender are universally shared and not socially constructed.
1.2.1. Pro: Gender expression may be a product of cultural and social norms, and expressed differently in different societies, but there is always a clear distinction made within those societies between the genders.
1.2.2. Con: This describes what a social construct is: a *perception* that is universally shared.
1.2.2.1. Con: Universal perception does not sufficiently demonstrate that something is constructed socially. Everyone living perceives universally that they are breathing - but that is not a social construct.
1.2.3. Con: Even if we assume this is universally true, the way in which that work is divided between the sexes varies culture-to-culture, so there is no universal rule for which roles and activities are feminine and which are masculine.
1.2.4. Pro: What has changed is the particular gender roles assigned to each sex as we have moved from more physical labor which favors males \(hunting etc.\) to more intellectual professions \([The evolution of work](https://www.aspeninstitute.it/system/files/private_files/2014-01/doc/058-065%20demasi-ing%2061-62.pdf)\), where there is parity between men and women. Still this does not mean that gender roles are not biologically influenced, on the contrary, only that the need of a society shape what roles individuals take according to physical characteristics .
1.2.5. Con: Culture is created by a society. If a culture "divides labor" then that society is creating a construct. If some aspects of gender are socially constructed then gender is a social construct.
1.2.5.1. Con: If some aspects of gender are socially constructed, it does not necessarily mean that all of gender is a social construct. The same logic would say that since gender is part of being human, that being human is a social construct, and that since being human is part of the natural world, that the natural world is a social construct.
1.2.5.2. Con: Labor itself is a socially constructed phenomena involving the exchange of work for goods. Gender allocation within labor is not singularly resultant from social opinions on gender roles. Constraints imposed from gender/biological differences also affect labor participation, so division of labor can't be used to define gender.
1.2.6. Con: The fact that all cultures express a particular behaviour does not necessarily imply that the behaviour is biologically determined. For example, all cultures build houses, but we aren't hard wired to do so. Houses just happen to be universally useful.
1.2.7. Pro: If gender was socially constructed, we would expect no stable sex-differentiated behaviours across cultures. There are sex-differentiated behaviours that are universal or near-universal \([Wood & Eagly, 2002](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-15487-002)\). Therefore, it is inappropriate to reduce gender to a social construct.
1.2.8. Pro: Most human societies follow a gender division in labour which is based on biological differences and capabilities.
1.2.8.1. Pro: In [Norway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiJVJ5QRRUE) there are no social/legislative barriers to career choice by gender, yet we find traditionally masculine/feminine career roles have maximized. There are few female engineers, few male nurses. \([The Norwegian Gender Paradox](http://nordicparadox.se/)\)
1.2.8.1.1. Con: The gap between men and women in leading positions in the example of Norway is not caused by biological factors but it is rather "public sector monopolies and substantial tax [wedges](http://nordicparadox.se/)" among others that create the gap, thus it is indeed socially constructed.
1.2.8.2. Con: Communist regimes did not divide labor between men and women.  Eg: [Gender and Equality of Opportunity in China’s Labour Market](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.628.2750&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
1.2.8.3. Con: Physical differences between men and women are more variable within one sex than between the sexes. Gender is taught based on belief about the two sexes in cultures; sex is given biologically and is not connected to abilities other than reproduction; even then, not every woman is capable of conception and some men are infertile as well.
1.2.8.4. Pro: In [Sweden](https://theculturetrip.com/europe/sweden/articles/swedish-teens-choose-careers-based-on-gender-roles-according-to-science/), where government has done more than any other country towards eliminating different socialization of boys and girls, [career](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153857) [choices](http://nordiclifescience.org/a-girl-or-a-boy-thing-gender-differences-in-career-choices/) of men and women remain [polarized](http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highlights/sweden-mismatch-priority-occupations) along gender stereotypes. Women just don't like STEM, despite 'gender neutrality'.
1.2.8.5. Con: While this is the system in patriarchal societies, the division of labour does not necessarily need to occur down gendered lines. It is possible that gender stereotypes, such as viewing women as weaker, lead to men and women doing particular types of labour because of societal influence.
1.2.8.5.1. Con: It is unlikely that all societies in history had the same division of labor if the decision was arbitrary.
1.2.8.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.13.1.3.1.
1.2.8.5.3. Pro: The gender roles of Native American tribes were [influenced](http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.gen.026) by how best to survive and function in their given time.
1.2.8.6. Pro: The fact that men's and women's bodies tend to be built differently, e.g. men tend to have bigger builds, means that they are suited to different types of work.
1.2.8.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.13.1.3.1.
1.2.8.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.13.1.3.1.1.
1.2.8.6.3. Con: The differences in bodies are a consequence of the social construction of gender rather than any innate biological differences.
1.2.8.6.3.1. Con: Sexual dimorphism is observed in apes \(closest species to humans\). Males apes are larger than female apes [\[1\]](http://web.missouri.edu/~flinnm/courses/mah/lectures/sd.htm). Those are social animals, but the social construct there is not complex enough to support the assertion that the only reason for sexual dimorphism is the social construct.
1.2.8.6.3.2. Pro: A gendered division of labor does not exist because of actual physical differences, but because women are discouraged from doing certain things \(sports, jobs\) that are considered unfeminine.
1.2.8.6.3.2.1. Pro: Black female athletes are regularly [criticized](http://time.com/3964758/body-shaming-black-female-athletes/) for their bodies being "not feminine enough", often resulting in professional disadvantages .
1.2.8.6.3.2.1.1. Pro: [Serena Williams](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/14/serena-williams-female-athletes-femininity-police) has been called has been called an 'ape' and a 'gorilla' for her 'masculine' physique.
1.2.8.6.3.2.1.2. Pro: When Olympic gold-medalist [Caster Semenya](http://people.com/sports/olympic-runner-caster-semenya-raising-questions-about-gender-and-sports/) refused to conform to expected gender norms, she was bullied and scrutinised, and had her identity and gender questioned.
1.2.8.6.3.2.2. Con: While this might have been the case a few years ago, now female muscles and '[ab cracks](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/sep/14/ab-crack-taylor-swift-serena-williams)' are in fashion.
1.2.8.6.3.2.2.1. Con: [Female bodybuilders](https://kar.kent.ac.uk/41748/) are seen as "gender outlaws" because they transgress the dominant understanding of what is aesthetically acceptable for women.
1.2.8.6.3.3. Pro: Genes [only establish potential](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-therapy/201108/male-and-female-the-overlapping-curves), but societal expectations heavily influence what a person makes of that genetic potential. For example, genes establish a range for how strong a given woman could be, but society limits how much of that potential manifests itself by discouraging her from developing her physical strength.
1.2.8.6.3.3.1. Con: Using the other side of the same token of this argument, a woman can have a limit of X on a certain trait and no social conditioning and help can help her overcome the limitation.
1.2.8.7. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.13.1.3.2.
1.2.8.8. Con: Women are underrepresented in many fields where no differences in physical capabilities apply. This is because these professions are traditionally seen as masculine.
1.2.8.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.10.2.
1.2.8.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.10.
1.2.8.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.13.1.7.5.
1.2.8.9. Con: Women are overrepresented in fields where no differences in physical capabilities apply. This is because these professions are traditionally seen as feminine.
1.2.8.9.1. Con: Professions previously dominated by men can be taken over by women, like it happened to [veterinary medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC340187/) which is now dominated by women.
1.2.8.9.2. Pro: [Teaching](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9849976/Teaching-in-primary-schools-still-seen-as-a-womans-job.html), particularly in primary schools, is still seen as a woman's job.
1.2.8.9.3. Pro: [Nursing](https://www.nursingtimes.net/why-are-there-so-few-men-in-nursing/849269.article), particularly midwifery and health-visiting, are seen as feminine professions. Men who are nurses feel like their jobs are less acceptable to society.
1.2.8.9.4. Pro: Being a [secretary](http://www.xojane.com/issues/why-is-secretary-still-the-top-job-for-women) is still seen as a woman's role. In the US, 96% of secretaries in 2010 were women, and they were paid up to $5,000 fewer than their male counterparts.
1.2.8.10. Pro: [In most countries](http://www.glopp.ch/A5/en/multimedia/A5_1_pdf2.pdf), there is a concentration of women in services and of men in manufacturing.
1.2.8.10.1. Con: [In parts of Asia](http://www.glopp.ch/A5/en/multimedia/A5_1_pdf2.pdf) it is common to see women working as labourers constructing roads, while in Europe this road construction is generally a men’s job.
1.2.8.11. Con: This division of labor is arbitrary. Historically, women have stepped in and taken over physically demanding "male" jobs such as working on assembly lines, in lumber and steel mills, or in the production of heavy machinery.
1.2.8.11.1. Con: Women stepping up in great numbers to perform physically demanding jobs typically performed by men has only happened in war time when the male labor force was conscripted. Such a phenomena is an example of gender roles being socially altered by necessity, not that the gender roles during peace time are also socially constructed.
1.2.8.11.2. Pro: [Rosie the Riveter](http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1656.html) is celebrated as an icon from the WW II era, and clearly shows that women are seen as equally capable as men as long as it's politically useful.
1.2.8.11.3. Pro: During [World War I](http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-women-war-workers-of-the-north-west), when a majority of men were conscripted for the war effort, over 600,000 women took on previously male-dominated roles in industry, working alongside men in reserved occupations.
1.2.8.11.3.1. Pro: These jobs included working in munition factories, science laboratories, coal mines, flour mills, as well as making tyres, working with asbestos, manufacturing glucose, and producing glass. Physical division of labour was proven to be arbitrary.
1.2.8.12. Pro: [In most countries](http://www.glopp.ch/A5/en/multimedia/A5_1_pdf2.pdf), house chores and everything that relates to sustaining the household and childcare are typically women’s tasks. On the other hand, more technical house tasks, like dealing with electrical or mechanical equipment, is traditionally a man’s job.
1.2.8.12.1. Pro: Women tend to be better at raising children than men.
1.2.8.12.1.1. Pro: This is recognised by the judicial system when significantly more women get [custodial rights](http://www.divorcenet.com/resources/divorce/for-men/divorce-for-men-why-women-get-child-custody-over-80-time) over children after a divorce.
1.2.8.12.1.1.1. Con: In the UK, [Fathers4Justice](http://www.fathers-4-justice.org/about-f4j/fact-sheet/) fights against fathers being treated as second class parents, claiming that the judicial system is biased against them, and that divorce settlements often reduce them to "cash points".
1.2.8.12.1.1.2. Con: Even though shared custody after divorce is increasing in many countries, most legislations still decide to place the child at the care of the parent who previously did most of the care \(to avoid disruption in the kid’s life\). Thus the main reason more women get custody is because they were are the ones mostly taking care of children, not because they are intrinsically better at it.
1.2.8.12.1.2. Pro: Only [72% of the children](http://occupytheory.org/deadbeat-dads-statistics/) in the US that are supposed to receive child support from their fathers actually do. These are called 'deadbeat dads' who abandon their children financially and emotionally.
1.2.8.12.1.3. Pro: Teaching kids emotional intelligence - how to recognise their feelings, understand where they come from and learn how to deal with them - is [crucial for a happy life](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201603/why-we-need-teach-kids-emotional-intelligence). Women are [much better placed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2016/03/11/new-study-shows-women-consistently-outperform-men-in-emotional-intelligence/#40590901335d) to teach this to children than men are.
1.2.8.12.1.3.1. Con: Men raising a child without a female partner were found to have the [same level of emotional response](http://www.newstatesman.com/sci-tech/2014/07/brain-father-why-men-can-be-just-good-primary-parents-women) as a mother and the same thinking and planning response as a secondary father. In other words, they are able to perform both roles.
1.2.8.12.1.4. Pro: Our mothers have a [much stronger influence](https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/25/6/1030/2467439/Intergenerational-transmission-of-parenting) on our parenting methods than our fathers do.
1.2.8.12.1.4.1. Con: That does not prove that mothers are intrinsically better at parenting, just that they are more [present](http://visual.ons.gov.uk/the-value-of-your-unpaid-work/). In the UK \(where the study is conducted\) men spend on average 16 hours a week doing house chores and child care. Women spend 26 hours a week and women on maternity leave up to 60 hours; including 37 hours "actively engaging" with their children.
1.2.8.12.1.5. Con: The concept of parenthood, and thereby motherhood, is one that is socially and historically constructed \([Araújo Martins et al.,p. 122](https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/32410/4/Revista_de_Enfermagem_Referência_RIII1394_English.pdf)\). Motherhood as a quality is not innate.
1.2.8.12.1.5.1. Pro: This can be seen in the rise of stay at home dads. [One in seven fathers](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/oct/25/stay-at-home-dads-fathers-childcarers) in the UK are now the main child-carers.
1.2.8.12.1.5.1.1. Con: [The study quoted above](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/oct/25/stay-at-home-dads-fathers-childcarers) also found that this trend has been driven by growing numbers of women who now earn more than their partners. This suggests that the rise in stay at home dads is due to an economic trend rather than a rethinking of parenting roles.
1.2.8.12.1.6. Con: -> See 1.2.8.12.1.3.1.
1.2.8.12.1.7. Con: Out of 79 [studies](http://whatweknow.law.columbia.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-wellbeing-of-children-with-gay-or-lesbian-parents/) about same-sex families, 75 conclude that having two parents from the same sex does not have a negative effect on children.
1.2.8.12.1.7.1. Con: Such studies may contain [methodological errors](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0033294116665594?journalCode=prxa) that make it difficult to determine causality. Relationship instability and social desirability may be confounding factors. Also, some of these studies compare children in same-sex families to adopted children, who are known to fare worse than children raised by their biological parents.
1.2.8.12.1.7.2. Pro: Most of these studies include or focus on children raised in households with two male parents, therefore proving that men can be as good at raising children as women.
1.2.9. Con: The majority of people may divide labor along gender lines, but [by no means all societies do](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jun/15/childrensservices.familyandrelationships).
1.2.9.1. Pro: This is not universal. [Baklas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakla#Culture) in the Philippines, for example, are socially accepted non-binary males. Rather, what constitutes gender is a matter of teaching and environment.
1.2.9.2. Pro: The perception of gender roles as something fixed comes from an erroneous ethnocentric vision of Western societies.
1.2.9.2.1. Con: The perception of gender roles as something fixed comes \(at least in part\) from anatomical differences between the genders \(e.g., a woman's role may include giving birth while a man's role cannot\) that are independent of any "ethnocentric vision" \(whether erroneous or not\).
1.2.9.2.2. Pro: In Southeast Asia, matriarchy was once the norm, and in Yunnan Province in China, [this set of gender roles still exist.](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/19/china-mosuo-tribe-matriarchy)
1.2.9.2.2.1. Pro: The Nairs of Kerala and the Khasi and Garo tribes of Meghalaya are recognised historically as [matrilineal societies in India.](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/living-examples-of-matrilineal-societies-in-india/1/614739.html)
1.2.9.2.2.1.1. Con: In reality, a true matriarchal society never existed in Kerala and [men still wielded much of the power](https://feminisminindia.com/2016/09/01/decline-matrilineal-society-kerala/) in the public domain.
1.2.9.2.3. Pro: Muxes in Mexico, hijras/aravanis, kinnars in India, the katoey of Thailand, two-spirit people in Native American communities, etc. are [culturally acceptable](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/third-gender-muxes_n_1949638) non-binary or trans identities within their own communities.
1.2.9.2.3.1. Con: The hijra community in India has indeed been recognised as existing for centuries, but this does not mean they are culturally integrated, or even treated as fully human by society. In fact, [quite the opposite is usually true](https://thewire.in/112988/queer-access-to-justice-icj-report/).
1.2.9.2.3.1.1. Pro: The hijra community still [faces wide discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_\(South_Asia\)#Social_status_and_economic_circumstances) on the ground: most hijras live at the margins of society with very low status, they are discriminated in health, housing, education, employment, immigration, law, and bureaucracy, and above all violence against them is still widespread.
1.2.9.2.4. Pro: Western culture has come to view gender as a binary concept, male or female, grounded in physical anatomy. However, anatomical variations alone should be enough to indicate a [gender spectrum](https://www.genderspectrum.org/quick-links/understanding-gender/) rather than a binary gender system.
1.2.9.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.3.2.
1.2.9.2.4.2. Con: However, anatomical variations rarely occur. In fact, [only](https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf) 0.05% to 1.7% of people are born intersex, or having anatomical variations. These variations do not occur often at all, so they are not sufficient evidence of the existence of a gender spectrum.
1.2.9.2.4.2.1. Con: [The world is a big place](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/), with lots of people therefore that 'only' 0.05% translates to 3.8 million people.
1.2.9.2.4.2.2. Con: As mentioned, this is similar to the number of red haired people. It is widely acknowledged that red hair is an actual hair color, not some anomaly.
1.2.9.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.4.1.2.1.
1.2.9.2.6. Pro: Muslim men in South Asia, Central Asia and Middle East, wear [surma](https://benawhat.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/why-do-afghan-men-wear-eyeliner/) \[a black substance that many mistake for eyeliner, worn around the eyes\] for religious and health reasons. In other parts of the world and in other religious societies, this is regarded as make-up for women.
1.2.10. Con: Changes in gendered division of labor have occurred erasing traditional perceptions and showing that discrimination is the result of socially constructed behaviors and stereotypes.
1.2.10.1. Pro: Many countries adopted anti-gender discrimination laws.
1.2.10.1.1. Pro: The [Swedish parental leave](https://sweden.se/society/gender-equality-in-sweden/) and the [Discrimination Act](http://www.government.se/information-material/2015/09/discrimination-act-2008567/) have been important factors in making Sweden a gender-egalitarian leader.
1.2.10.2. Pro: As the movement of women’s work from the household to the labor market has shown, changing the nature of gender inequality and discrimination is possible. Thus they must be socially constructed.
1.2.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.13.1.7.
1.2.10.4. Con: Attitudes about gender roles have changed in the workplace, yet unpaid domestic labor is still divided along gender lines: housework and care work such as child rearing and caring for the elderly is traditionally performed by women. This is generally referred to as "[double burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_burden#Gender_ideology)".
1.2.11. Pro: Gender roles are necessary for society to function healthily. Without them there would be confusion and chaos.
1.2.11.1. Con: Over time people have kept saying that, we've kept ignoring them, and nothing bad has kept happening.
1.2.11.2. Pro: Gender roles are necessary as they give each gender specific responsibilities and purposes in the household and society.
1.2.11.2.1. Con: Even in very traditional societies, gender identity can be flexible to suit the needs of a family, such as the tradition of [Bacha posh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacha_posh) in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
1.2.11.2.1.1. Con: The practice of Bacha posh in fact shows the rigidity of gender roles. Girls must wear male clothing, have their hair cut short, and use a male name in order to go to school or work. This means that girls must adopt male characteristics in order to leave the household.
1.2.11.2.2. Con: Albania's [Sworn Virgins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_sworn_virgins) can become heads of household, inherit in a patrilineal society, dress as a man and interact socially with men. Motivations to take this vow can be personal or with the family's well-being in mind.
1.2.11.2.2.1. Con: This practice actually shows the rigidity of gender roles. "Sworn Virgins" must adopt as many male characteristics as possible in order to escape the confines of gender roles associated with femininity.
1.2.11.2.3. Pro: The economic principle of [the law of comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage) states that it is always best for two parties to specialize, even if one of the parties is better at producing every single good. Applied to families, this means that the parents \(men and women\) ought to specialize into complementary, non-overlapping roles to the extent possible.
1.2.11.2.3.1. Con: There is, however, no reason why women should specialise in domestic work. The economic principle allows for specialisation in that which one of the parent is best at, rather than imposing arbitrary restrictions on what each parent should do.
1.2.11.3. Con: Gender roles are restrictive. In many societies, women are still unable to succeed and cannot enjoy freedom because of gender roles.
1.2.11.3.1. Con: Society is a collective agreement to restrict ourselves for the benefit of all. Just as overly restrictive societies will suffer, so to can we expect overly permissive societies to suffer.
1.2.11.3.1.1. Con: There is no stated reason to believe this point at the moment.
1.2.11.3.2. Pro: Gender stereotypes and discriminatory social norms often prevent women from escaping domestic work, or gaining employment outside the house. The [gender gap](http://blog.giwps.georgetown.edu/rethinking-gender-roles-for-womens-economic-participation/) for economic participation and opportunity stands at 60% worldwide. This is especially harmful for single mothers and working class women.
1.2.11.3.2.1. Pro: Over [1 billion urban women](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/developing-world-property-rights-women/) in developing countries lack the ability to fully exercise their property rights. Reasons for this include unequal formal property rights, cultural norms preventing equal property rights, and a lack of access to the tools and means to exercise property rights \(such as formal land titles or savings accounts\).
1.2.11.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.5.
1.2.11.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.8.
1.2.11.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.9.
1.2.11.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.
1.2.11.4. Con: Rigid gender roles [prevent](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rediscovering-love/201509/rigid-gender-roles-enemies-the-new-intimacy) many individuals from seeking happiness in relationships. Those who have challenged gender roles in relationships are happier than those who have not.
1.2.11.4.1. Pro: By [sticking](https://www.healingsolutions.ca/2015/01/07/gender-roles-limit-us/) to gender roles, women may feel unfulfilled, held back, and unappreciated. Men may feel too much pressure to perform, provide, or may feel confined by the perceived rules of the role they are assigned.
1.2.11.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.11.1.3.
1.2.11.4.2. Pro: The [UN](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WRGS/Pages/GenderStereotypes.aspx) has said that gender stereotypes can harm and limit children's capacity to develop their personal abilities, pursue their professional careers and make choices about their lives and life plans.
1.2.11.4.2.1. Con: The UN is too full of corruption to be a moral authority on this or any other topic. They cover-up government atrocities so UN peacekeepers can be withdrawn and claim [success](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/19/dont-abandon-darfur-says-un-whistleblower). They are involved in many scandals including peacekeepers raping children as young as 12 even after officials had knowledge of what was [happening](https://www.thetrumpet.com/1853-the-corruption-of-the-united-nations).
1.2.11.4.2.1.1. Con: Despite possible corruption in the higher-ups, the UN has the [resources](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/Resources.aspx) and tools to conduct extensive research whose conclusions should not just be overlooked.
1.2.11.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Because of the corruption, the research and conclusions are often biased to promote specific political agenda.
1.2.11.4.2.1.2. Con: The UN is [responsible](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/UDHRIndex.aspx) for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \(1948\) among many other international documents that protect adults and children's rights that most developed countries in the world have [signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights#Adoption).
1.2.11.4.2.1.3. Con: -> See discussion #15052: The UN is a good thing
1.2.11.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.4.
1.2.11.5. Con: Raising children in societies that adhere to rigid gender roles can actually be [detrimental](https://thinkprogress.org/forcing-kids-to-stick-to-gender-roles-can-actually-be-harmful-to-their-health-34aef42199f2#.id6aw57cr) to their physical and mental health.
1.2.11.5.1. Pro: Gender roles [stifle individuality](http://www.nazannouncer.com/opinion/2011/12/14/do-gender-roles-stifle-individuality/) in children from a young age.
1.2.11.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.4.2.
1.2.11.6. Pro: If society wants healthy happy children and stable communities, it must embrace the values of the distinct gender roles.
1.2.11.6.1. Con: "Happy children" and "stable communities" are opinionized. "Society", as a concept/idea, doesn't have a self opinion, therefore can't decide what it wants.
1.2.11.6.2. Con: There are [plenty of studies](http://whatweknow.law.columbia.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-wellbeing-of-children-with-gay-or-lesbian-parents/) concluding that children of gay or lesbian parents fare no worse than other children.
1.2.11.6.3. Pro: Women will always have to respect certain responsibilities, such as motherhood.
1.2.11.6.3.1. Pro: Only women can give birth, thus they must respect their role in child-raising.
1.2.11.6.3.1.1. Con: [Thomas Beatie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Beatie) became famous as the "pregnant man".
1.2.11.6.3.1.2. Con: The act of giving birth is a biological one and cannot change, but the role of raising the child does not have to be constrained to women. This is shown by the [increase](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3130149/Stay-home-mothers-fall-record-low-number-house-husbands-doubles-two-decades.html) in the number of house-husbands.
1.2.11.6.3.1.3. Con: Around [10% of women in the US](https://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/infertility.html#b) are infertile and cannot have children. This shows that the ability to give birth is not as inextricably tied to womanhood as commonly thought.
1.2.11.6.3.1.4. Con: Non-binary and transmasculine people can give birth to children as well.
1.2.11.6.3.2. Pro: [Only 21% of US citizens](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/chapter-2-public-views-on-changing-gender-roles/) think that the trend of mothers of young children working outside the home is a good thing.
1.2.11.6.3.2.1. Con: The assumption that a number of people who aren't experts on the subject is relevant is the logical fallacy of argument from popularity.
1.2.11.7. Pro: New Natural Law philosophy argues that the marital union between man and woman with the aim of procreation and child-rearing is a [basic good of human society](https://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/new-natural-law-homosexuality-and.html). Undermining it in any way, e.g. by questioning its fundamental assumption of the difference and complementarity of men and women, undermines the moral foundations of our society.
1.2.11.7.1. Con: The New Natural Law bases the concept of moral in the existence of God, thus becoming more a matter of religion and less of biology.
1.2.11.7.2. Pro: New Natural Law theories assume that there are basic goods that are central to genuine human flourishing. These basic goods are assumed to be self-evident. Depending on the author, [they include things like life](http://lyceumphilosophy.com/?q=node/97), health, friendship, marriage, harmony with God, and harmony among a person’s judgments, choices, feelings, and behaviour. It is considered moral to pursue these goods and immoral to undermine them.
1.2.11.7.3. Pro: For New Natural Law theorists, the good of marriage not only consists of couples forming a moral or spiritual union, but also [bodily union through the act of marital intercourse](http://the good of marriage, couples form a union of persons not just morally or spiritually, but also bodily, in the act of marital intercourse.  Because sexual intercourse actualizes a biological function that can only be actualized by the couple together, the couple are, in marital intercourse, literally “one flesh,” and this one flesh union is the physical realization of the basic good of marriage). Because sexual intercourse actualizes a biological function that can only be actualized by the couple together, this union is the physical realisation of the basic good of marriage.
1.2.12. Con: The gender division of labour [is not fixed](http://www.glopp.ch/A5/en/multimedia/A5_1_pdf2.pdf) for all time; it changes in response to wider economic, political and social changes, e.g. migration.
1.2.12.1. Con: Cultures still recognize a difference between men and women, even if the specifics of that recognition change over time.
1.2.12.1.1. Con: A number of cultures have had diverse genders beyond just man and woman, as explained in [Teen vogue](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/gender-variance-around-the-world). Though sex is also being seen now as a [Spectrum](http://Specthttps://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943rum). If genders as we see them in a binary society do not fit with these cultural and biological facts, yet they are defined by western society regardless of these facts, they must be a social construct.
1.2.12.1.2. Con: This presupposes that "cultures" are an accepted authority on the extent to which gender is socially constructed or biologically determined; without giving solid reasons why this authority should be accepted, this is a fallacious appeal to authority.
1.2.12.2. Pro: Integrating women into the workforce was an economic and political necessity for some time, but gender inequality starts rising once a certain level of development is attained. For example, the female labour participation rate has been falling [in the most developed parts](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/opinion/global/chinas-entrenched-gender-gap.html) of China and gender perceptions are still largely based on Confucianism. This shows that changes are temporary at best and that society reverts to a gender-based division of labour whenever possible.
1.2.12.2.1. Con: This only shows that gender divisions based in religions \(and almost-religions like Confucianism\) are deeply rooted, hard and slow to change.
1.3. Pro: The hierarchical structure of gender is upheld in order to maintain social control.
1.3.1. Con: Hierarchical structures based on biological sex have evolved in many species – all with lesser cognitive abilities than Homo sapiens, with no evidence that there is any conspiracy of one gender to control another.
1.3.1.1. Pro: In a scientific [study](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13596-male-monkeys-prefer-boys-toys/), it was concluded that male monkeys show a preference for wheeled toys over plush dolls, whereas female monkeys spent a balanced amount of time with both toys.
1.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.1.2.
1.3.2. Con: If gender is a social construct meant to exalt the masculine and suppress the feminine, it is unclear why a biological male would chose to identify as a female, to his own disadvantage.
1.3.2.1. Con: The fact that people who are assigned male at birth do want to be accepted as females despite the challenges and possible dangers this entails shows that gender identity is not something you can chose freely. If it was, everyone would choose to be male in a patriarchal society.
1.3.2.2. Con: As social construct, men are prohibited from activities assigned to women. Not all men follows the idea that feminine activities are inferior, and prohibiting them threatens their freedom.
1.3.2.3. Con: gender is an orienting device within society. It helps individuals find and locate their place, and sense of self within the various communities they inhabit. This process of self-orienting is done both by adhering to and contravening gendered expectations - a process referred to as 'turning,' or 'queering' more specifically when it comes to defying or blurring those expectations.
1.3.3. Con: This could be true even if gender is entirely biological and immutable.
1.3.4. Pro: Gender is used by nation states for greater administrative control.
1.3.4.1. Pro: The introduction of the birth control policy in China, a highly patriarchal society, saw many [harmful outcomes for the female population,](http://cominghomecrazy.weebly.com/forgotten-females.html) with a massive rise of sex-selective abortions and female infanticide.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: The Chinese government did not want to target the female population in terms of female infanticide, which occurred mostly in rural areas. [Current policy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/11/16/chinas-rules-for-when-families-can-and-cant-have-more-than-one-child/?utm_term=.b54f7935bc90) towards rural farmers reflect the desire to protect daughters and future women.
1.3.4.1.2. Pro: [Forced sterilization](http://wunrn.com/2016/05/china-forced-abortion-sterilization-fines-enforce-chinas-population-control-policy-data-through-2015/) still exists in China.
1.3.4.2. Pro: This has often taken the form of forcible interference with reproduction. For example, there are many instances of forcible sterilization of women, often without their knowledge or consent.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: [Romani](https://romediafoundation.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/forced-sterilization-of-romani-women-a-persisting-human-rights-violation/) women were forcibly sterilized in an attempt to reduce the Roma population in Czechoslovakia. Despite the practice being outlawed, cases have been recorded as late as [2007.](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/07/roma-women-share-stories-forced-sterilisation-160701100731050.html)
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Over 3,400 Native American women, some under the age of 21, were [forcibly sterilized](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/543.html) by the US government.
1.3.4.2.3. Pro: A 1965 survey of Puerto Rican residents found that about one-third of all Puerto Rican mothers, ages 20-49, were [sterilized](http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/health-info/forced-sterilization/). After the United States assumed governance of Puerto Rico in 1948, women were pushed towards having hysterectomies or tubal ligations without informed consent.
1.3.4.2.4. Pro: "[Mississippi appendectomy](https://mississippiappendectomy.wordpress.com/about/)" refers to hysterectomies/ tubal ligations forced on poor women in the US South during the height of the American Eugenics movement, against their will and often without their knowledge.
1.3.4.2.5. Pro: Australia was under [investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/10/un-examines-australias-forced-sterilisation-of-women-with-disabilities) by the UN in 2015 for allowing the forced sterilization of women with disabilities.
1.3.4.2.6. Pro: Doctors in [Kenya](https://www.guernicamag.com/the-throwaways/) are forcibly sterilizing HIV-positive women, often without their knowledge or consent.
1.3.4.2.7. Pro: Until 2016, trans people in [France](http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/14/13283086/transgender-law-france-sterilization-gender-change) couldn't legally change their gender unless they agreed to be sterilized.
1.3.4.2.8. Pro: Between 2006 and 2010, nearly 150 female inmates were coerced into getting sterilized in [Californian prisons](http://cironline.org/reports/female-inmates-sterilized-california-prisons-without-approval-4917).
1.3.4.3. Pro: Colonial powers have used gender binary systems and [heteropatriarchy](https://www.solidarity-us.org/node/736) to colonise local, indigenous ways of living.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: In many pre-colonial African societies, women held complementary \(rather than subordinate\) positions to men, and were represented in government. Colonial powers established "Native Authorities", which were made up of men only; women were subsequently limited to the private domain.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: In Colonial [systems](https://prezi.com/48h9imv-1tl1/gender-colonialism-and-sexuality-the-impact-of-colonialism-on-african-women/), for example South Africa in Colonial times and during Apartheid, men were expected to work on farms, in mines, or in urban areas, while women were to stay behind and provide labor in rural areas.
1.3.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.3.5. Con: Many now and former totalitarian countries \(the USSR, China, [Ethiopia](http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/5538/dissertation_indrawatie_b.pdf?sequence=1), \(pp. 101-116\) etc.\) have used gender equity as a means of social control.
1.3.5.1. Con: According to the source, the government of [Ethiopia](http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/5538/dissertation_indrawatie_b.pdf?sequence=1) saw women as cheap labor to exploit without giving them real equality. That equality can be perverted to achieve nefarious goals, does not mean equality per se is used as a form of control but the promise of it.
1.3.5.2. Con: If gender was not a social construct - as is asserted in the parent argument - and is in fact innate, how could these regimes manipulate it to their causes?
1.3.6. Pro: Stereotypes and normative scripts around gender have developed such that people face societal pressure to buy into them, and potentially face social consequences for not doing so. In this way society continues to construct gender and expect different behaviour on the basis of gender.
1.3.6.1. Con: While there is still a lot of progress to be made, society's gender expectations continue to shift over time. The scripts are slightly less rigid than they used to be. For example, today there are children's books available for purchase whose characters buck traditional gender norms. In the recent past, no such books were written let alone sold on a large scale.
1.3.6.2. Con: Transgender people abide by gender roles by labeling themselves with a gender.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.4.6.3.
1.3.6.3. Pro: Stereotypes are often relied on when explaining the differences between men and women, e.g. women are portrayed as more emotional and men as tougher. When society relies on these stereotypes, individuals feel a need to present themselves on the basis of them, in order to feel as though they are correctly performing their gender.
1.3.6.3.1. Pro: An example of a stereotype that people feel pressured to abide by is short \(male\) or long \(female\) hair styles.
1.3.6.3.1.1. Pro: A stereotype exists about women with short hair having a [gay](http://www.cablecarcouture.com/short-hair-disclaimer-5-risks-of-having-short-hair/) sexual orientation.
1.3.6.3.1.2. Pro: Corporate dress manuals reflect conservative expectations, including short hair on men. This discriminates against males with long, or [feminine](http://kikiandtea.com/2013/01/why-do-we-continue-to-discriminate-against-men-with-long-hair/), hair.
1.3.6.3.2. Pro: An example of a stereotype that people feel pressured to abide by is male or female clothing styles which have their own sections in stores.
1.3.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.5.
1.3.6.5. Pro: [Individuals who challenge traditional notions of gender](https://www.genderspectrum.org/explore-topics/social-services/) are often rejected at home, in schools, churches and in their communities.
1.3.6.5.1. Pro: Transgender people face a high risk of prejudice and mental health problems: approximately [41 percent of trans people in the U.S. have attempted suicide](http://www.livescience.com/50635-bruce-jenner-transgender-prevalence.html), according to a 2010 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
1.3.6.5.1.1. Con: The high suicide rate and related mental-health problems are good reasons not to introduce the concept to children. Doing so would unnecessarily add confusion and introduce ideas that could ultimately lead to being extremely [unhappy](https://www.tfpstudentaction.org/blog/dr-michelle-cretella-on-transgender-ideology).
1.3.6.5.1.1.1. Con: [Children](http://www.transkidspurplerainbow.org/about-us/) who are intersex or express a variance from the gender they were assigned, do so against societal pressures, not because they were introduced to the concept of gender, especially since some are as young as 3 years old.
1.3.6.5.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.5.2.
1.3.6.5.1.1.3. Con: [Transgender](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brynn-tannehill/the-truth-about-transgend_b_8564834.html) young adults who were in [supportive](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2) social environments faced depression rates only moderately higher than average, attempted suicide less frequently than the general population, and had similar mental health outcomes. Those in unsupportive environments attempted suicide 7.25x more than the general population, had 3x higher rates of depression, and much worse mental health outcomes.
1.3.6.5.1.2. Pro: According to [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178031/), "gender-based victimization, discrimination, bullying, violence, being rejected by the family, friends, and community; harassment by intimate partner, family members, police and public; discrimination and ill treatment at health-care system are the major risk factors that influence the suicidal behavior" among the trans community.
1.3.6.5.2. Pro: Due to discrimination, many trans people are [under-employed](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/25/transgender-rights) or not employed at all.
1.3.6.5.3. Pro: Trans people also face discrimination in health services. [Tyra Hunter](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/25/transgender-rights) was an example of this oppression, when a paramedic refused to treat her after discovering she possessed male genitalia and instead let her die.
1.3.6.5.4. Con: Not all societies are as closed-minded to transgender individuals.
1.3.6.5.4.1. Pro: In South Asia, the hijra community has existed for millennia, and in 2014 was given[full legal recognition](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/16/india-third-gender-claims-place-in-law) in India.
1.3.6.5.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.2.3.1.
1.3.6.5.4.2. Pro: Thailand is very comfortable with the idea of "the third gender", and one school even went so far as to accommodate them with [a third washroom choice.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7529227.stm)
1.3.6.5.4.2.1. Con: However, trans women in Thailand face [notable discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Thailand#Trans_life_in_the_country) with regards to jobs and education. For example, even post-operation trans women are not allowed to wear a woman's uniform in government jobs.
1.3.6.5.5. Pro: Trans people are [regularly murdered](https://tdor.info/about-2/) for simply defying gender norms.
1.3.6.5.5.1. Pro: Almost all [victims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unlawfully_killed_transgender_people) are trans women.
1.3.6.5.6. Pro: Many trans women, as well as gender non-conforming people who appear feminine, are the targets of [transmisogyny](http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/01/transmisogyny/).
1.3.6.6. Pro: Women are particularly affected by these stereotypes.
1.3.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.1.5.3.2.
1.3.6.6.2. Pro: As an example of these consequences, women who are strong and assertive in the workplace may face backlash and be described as ['bossy' or 'bitchy'](https://www.fastcompany.com/3041942/strong-female-lead/the-end-of-bitchy-addressing-stereotypes-of-women-at-work). This is often a way of putting women down or criticising them.
1.3.6.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.6.3.2.
1.3.6.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.4.1.3.
1.3.6.6.5. Pro: Women are stereotypically considered to be more emotional and irrational, which leads to their concerns or ideas being taken less seriously.
1.3.6.6.5.1. Pro: This stereotype has many harmful consequences. For example, even though women are [more likely](https://rewire.news/article/2015/02/13/chronic-pain-overwhelmingly-experienced-women-trouble-getting-care/) to suffer from chronic pain  -  fibromyalgia, for instance, almost exclusively affects women  - they’re less likely than their male counterparts to receive appropriate treatment for it. This approach toward female patients fits into the [stereotype](https://thinkprogress.org/when-gender-stereotypes-become-a-serious-hazard-to-womens-health-f1f130a5e79#.8qqgv0scf) that women are dramatic, irrational, and crazy.
1.3.6.6.5.1.1. Pro: This not only applies to chronic pain but also [emergencies](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/emergency-room-wait-times-sexism/410515/). In the US nationwide men wait an average of 49 minutes to receive analgesic for acute abdominal pain while women wait an average of 65: gender [bias](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18439195) is the most likely explanation.
1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.17.3.
1.3.8. Con: -> See 1.2.11.
1.3.9. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.13.1.
1.3.10. Con: Some studies have found that children raised in same-sex families have [worse](http://www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~pnc/allen-ss-grad.pdf) academic outcomes and are twice more likely to have emotional [problems](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2500537). This shows that gender differences are the natural basis of families and thus our society.
1.3.10.1. Con: The problems with mental health may also come from social disapproval and ridicule that children from same-sex families might face
1.3.10.1.1. Con: [One of the studies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2500537) states that the effect they found was regardless of social stigma.
1.3.10.2. Con: The emotional problems study doesn't show same sex couples are the problem as much as how many biological parents you have.
1.3.10.3. Con: Only a small number of families in these [studies](http://whatweknow.law.columbia.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-wellbeing-of-children-with-gay-or-lesbian-parents/) are comprised by stable sex-same families. In most cases, they also include children of women or men previously married that afterwards formed a same-sex household, thus comparing stable heterosexual families with same-sex families that went through the disruption of a divorce or separation.
1.3.10.4. Con: -> See 1.2.8.12.1.7.
1.3.11. Pro: [Foucault argued](http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/histofsex/summary.html) that when sex and sexuality become an object of knowledge, the people who control this knowledge become increasingly important as they have an influence on behaviors. The same happens with gender, as part of the same discourse.
1.3.11.1. Pro: According to Foucault, the deployment of sexuality took place with the rise of the bourgeoisie, who saw sexual deviance as dangerous to the continued survival of their class because it distracted people from work. Sexuality is thus [a social construct for social control.](http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/histofsex/summary.html)
1.3.11.1.1. Pro: Foucault thought that the desire to control discourse and knowledge about sex is essentially [a desire to control power.](http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/histofsex/section1/page/2/) The control of the bourgeoisie over the discourse on sexuality is closely linked to the maintenance of power – the bourgeoisie wanted to control sex because it was a dangerous opponent to their work ethic.
1.3.11.1.1.1. Pro: A campaign for "the moralization of the poorer classes" was launched at the end of the 19th century, which ended with the repression of everything the medical and judicial system saw as "perverted" \([Foucault, p. 122](https://suplaney.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/foucault-the-history-of-sexuality-volume-1.pdf)\)
1.3.11.2. Pro: While the repression of sexual expression and sexuality started in the privileged classes, it had trickled down to the working classes by the end of the 19th century. \([p. 120-122](https://suplaney.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/foucault-the-history-of-sexuality-volume-1.pdf)\)
1.4. Pro: Gender is a social construct because its perception is fluid, and changes among time and societies.
1.4.1. Con: Gender roles are seen differently but that does not demonstrate that gender is seen differently.
1.4.1.1. Pro: The difference is universally in line with physical attributes \(those who can have and feed children vs. those who can't etc.\), and physical attributes do not change across cultures.
1.4.1.2. Con: 'Gender' itself is no more than a role; it is distinct from biologically-determined traits such as sex characteristics in that the very concept itself has been socially constructed from the beginning. Any suggestion that physical attributes must align with a particular gender fails to take this into account.
1.4.2. Con: If perceptions of gender changes across time and societies \(which often have strong connections to their original geography\), it is more probable that gender is a constant which is in eternal change based on the limits of its environment.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Gender roles will be perceived differently in a tropical island fisher/gatherer society where food is plentiful and easily obtainable by all sexes, versus an agrarian society with a limited growing season where the additional strength of males make them more valuable to resource acquisition, versus a modern society with labor-reducing machinery where the physical differences in the sexes are not as limiting.
1.4.2.2. Con: It's contradictory to speak of a constant which is in change.
1.4.3. Con: Different perceptions on a biological trait, like  age or ethnicity in different locations, does not change the trait.
1.4.3.1. Con: If gender is considered a social trait, then it can't be qualified as a biological one. Therefore, different perceptions might change how gender is seen.
1.4.4. Pro: Gender perception changes according to culture.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Anthropological study shows that demonstrations of male and female attributes change from society to society, with different groups of people having different ideas of what being 'male' or 'female' involves. There are places with more than two genders: we see that 'gender' is a relational and situational performance, e.g. the [berdache](http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.gen.004) among Native Americans. Examples like these \(of which there are many\) show us that that gender \(not sex - which is genitalia based\) is constructed.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Sex differences are on average static across societies on the large scale, with [clear statistical patterns](http://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iq-race-sex-gender-survey-mate-buss-nyborg-rushton-buss-behavioral-brain-sciences-19891.pdf) that hold regardless of culture or environment.
1.4.4.1.2. Con: This seems to be a repeat of the false dichotomy the nature/nurture debate often falls into. Gender can have significant influence from society without being completely constructed by it. The question is whether there are biological characteristics inherent to gender that are relevant to societal differences. Given what we know about biological difference \(hormones being a clear example\), it is difficult to imagine they would not play some role.
1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.4.
1.4.4.1.3. Pro: The "[Two Spirit Tradition](https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/opinions/two-spirits-one-heart-five-genders/)" among Native American cultures \(which was targeted by European Settlers for elimination when they arrived in America\) is one example of why gender is a social construct.
1.4.4.2. Pro: Examples of multiple cultures with differing and accepted forms of gender identity, including non-binary \(see [Samoan fa'afafine](https://theculturetrip.com/pacific/samoa/articles/fa-afafines-the-third-gender/), [Navajo Nádleeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-spirit#Terminology), etc\) create distinction between sex and gender at a cultural level, i.e. sex is biological, gender is cultural.
1.4.4.3. Pro: We also know of cultures existing today that demonstrate the social construction of gender. One such culture is the Musuo, which is a matriarchal, matrilineal egalitarian society. [LINK](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/01/the-kingdom-of-women-the-tibetan-tribe-where-a-man-is-never-the-boss)
1.4.4.4. Pro: Gender is a social construct because we use social resources such as language, story telling, metaphors, relationships and contexts to express and understand gender. In different contexts the expression differs eg. calm Japanese male, assertive American male.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: Humans also use imagination to question such constructs. Genres like science fiction, for example, have included alternative genders for a long time.
1.4.4.4.2. Con: The use of social resources such as language, story telling, metaphors etc does not explicitly mean gender is a social construct. We use language to denote mathematical principals. Teachers use stories and metaphors to explain biological concepts. Context could very easily be replaced by the word habitat. Relationships are found, on some level, in most living creatures \(be that conscious or unconscious\).
1.4.4.5. Con: While the men assumed the role of warriors and participated in combat, women were required to stay back to nurture the children and manage the home. Therefore, there is no fluidity, meaning the roles are fixed.
1.4.4.5.1. Con: Modern military institutions are now recruiting women into specific roles \(including combatant\) and these roles continue to expand. There has been little gender fluidity in the example you have given to date but the very fact that this is changing now demonstrates fluidity.
1.4.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.7.2.1.1.3.4.1.4.
1.4.4.5.3. Pro: It would be counterintuitive for men to assign the one gender role that guarantees death so rigidly to one's own gender.
1.4.4.6. Con: The prevalence of patriarchal societies, the plentiful examples of matriarchal societies and virtual non-existence of egalitarian societies indicates qualitative inequality of the sexes. Qualitative differences negates the notion of the capricious nature of social norms. Even in ostensibly egalitarian societies, character traits [diverge](https://www.bradley.edu/dotAsset/165918.pdf) to a greater extent than in less-egalitarian societies.
1.4.4.6.1. Pro: One would expect a near-equal amount of matriarchal and patriarchal societies if the sexes were qualitatively equal, as one sex would be just as capable of oppressing the other.
1.4.4.6.1.1. Con: Ideas travel and a lot of our world's history has been influenced by the thoughts and ideas of Europeans, who happened to take the patriarchal root, and who often destroyed any culture that did not share this view.
1.4.4.6.2. Pro: The philosophical ramification of this is that controlling for societal variables, innate sexual differences are allowed to express themselves to a greater degree.
1.4.5. Pro: Gender perception has changed over time.
1.4.5.1. Pro: In [China](http://www.pitlanemagazine.com/ethnicity-and-gender/gender-roles-in-different-cultures.html), the communist conception of gender equality contrasts with the Confucian past. This signifies how perceptions change with time and ideology.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.12.2.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Social and familial structures of any society in any given time are a consequence of the society's ability to reproduce the essentials of life \(food, clothing, etc\) \([Engels](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/origin_family.pdf), p.4\). If familial structures shape our conception of gender, and they are fluid with time and region, then so is gender.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: Cultures directing gender roles by fiat only reduce biological influences and force individuals to assume roles according to cultural norms and not their personal / innate interests. In egalitarian states like in Scandinavia, gender role differences are more pronounced because the removal of social pressures optimizes the pursuit of innate personal interests.
1.4.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.5.3.
1.4.5.3. Pro: Prior to the eighteenth century, it was believed that while there were physical differences between men and women, these were not important. Until the beginning of the eighteenth century, this [one-sex model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-sex_and_two-sex_theories#The_one-sex_theory) dominated medical and philosophical literature.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: This is the reason why even in 20th century medicine women weren't included in medical trials. The logic was to protect them as the child bearers, but it became clear that drugs do not affect men the same ways as women. In addition, multiple drugs such as some hormonal or pregnancy treatments are only geared for females. The fact that in 19th century scientists believed gender discrepancies to be insignificant doesn't prove that gender is changing over time. The beliefs change, not the facts.
1.4.5.3.2. Pro: Gender arose in the [19th century](https://othersociologist.com/sociology-of-gender/) with the broad diffusion of biomedical science around Western European practices and ideas, which consolidated the idea that sex determines gender identities and roles.
1.4.5.3.2.1. Con: Gender has been around for time immemorial, and most certainly [before the 19th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Middle_Ages).  Scientific understanding of gender only arose in the 19th century.
1.4.5.4. Pro: People are born into pre-existing material cultures that literally require bodies to adapt to a pre-designed, pre-gendered world whose requirements can change over time.
1.4.5.4.1. Pro: Clothing is perhaps the best example. Young children of both sexes born in the US [before 1890](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3174031?read-now=1&loggedin=true&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) wore in identical dresses and long, curled hair as can be seen in [images](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/159223?sortBy=Relevance&amp;deptids=62&amp;ft=boys+dresses&amp;offset=0&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=3) from the time. This changed by 1920 when women's roles and dress shifted to include those worn by men. Thereafter young boys wore pants.
1.4.5.5. Con: Over time, the perception of gender roles has adapted to the changing social environment at all times. Men and women have started performing actions that traditionally "belonged" to the opposite sex. However, this only goes for the roles that are attributed to gender. Gender itself has remained a fixed concept, as it is based on the unchanging given of XX and XY chromosomes, determining a person's gender. It has not changed with time.
1.4.5.5.1. Con: The process of differentiation between things like gender and species is based upon certain principles, but ultimately these things tread in an ambiguous territory, and are founded at the end upon culture, common sense, and somewhat arbitrary agreements within the scientific community. Species is an expression of traits, allowing for variation within a spectrum. If you look into the process set in motion by the presence of XX/XY chromosomes you similarly find a process with ample for ambiguity.
1.4.5.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.3.2.
1.4.6. Con: If gender is a social construct, surely more societies would have constructed a genderless culture before now.
1.4.6.1. Con: They have. [More societies before now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_history)
1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.2.8.
1.4.8. Pro: As women and non-binary individuals have been given more rights and opportunities, their roles in society have expanded and developed. The gender construct is therefore able to change as society changes.
1.4.8.1. Pro: New technologies and measures like [oocyte cryopreservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte_cryopreservation) allow women to live a more self-determined life which has impact on their roles in society.
1.4.9. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.
1.4.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.2.
1.4.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.9.
1.5. Pro: Phylogenic categorization is quite precisely a process of delineating a social construct, so that we can navigate a vastly complex world which demands that we be capable of coherent reference. But the relationship between reference and referent is inherently, always, situated on either vague generalization or a kind of pragmatism. This in no way relies on biology, but on the nature of language itself.
1.5.1. Pro: Categorization itself is inextricably tied to large-scale social contracts, which in turn are ultimately dependent on things like the prestige and position of the scientists who participate in establishing these social constructs. In other words, that which makes a frog a frog is large-scale semantic agreement; or, social construct.
1.6. Con: According to three main monotheistic religions' scriptures, God created the man and the woman as different and complementary.
1.6.1. Con: Even if it is granted that God created men and women differently, this does not mean that God created the distinction between them, nor that this distinction is mind-independent.
1.6.1.1. Pro: While there are some religious leaders who hold to the [complementarian view](https://cbmw.org/uncategorized/summaries-of-the-egalitarian-and-complementarian-positions/) of men and women, opinions are divided. While some people use complementarianism as a reason to exclude women from Church Leadership, Jesus himself had female followers who were arguably on level status with his male apostles, and Paul referred to a woman as a deacon in [Romans 16:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom+16%3A1-2&version=NRSV), a position of leadership within the Church. This suggests that men and women have equal rights to areas of leadership in the church.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: The word "diakonos" in [Romans 16:1-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom+16%3A1-2&version=NRSV) can be translated either "servant" or "deacon" in the [New Testament](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G1249&t=ESV), depending on context. Therefore, this text cannot be used as definitive proof of a female deacon.
1.6.1.1.2. Con: [Complementarianism](https://www.theopedia.com/complementarianism) is the view that men and women are equal in personhood, but have differing, complementary roles. To contrast complementarianism with equality is unclear and misleading, because though complementarianism does exclude women from certain church offices, it still affirms equality in other areas, such as moral value.
1.6.1.1.3. Con: The fact that Jesus had female disciples does not imply that they are "on level status with his male apostles." They are "on level status" in that they are of [equal personhood](https://www.theopedia.com/complementarianism) and [heirs with men of the grace of life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A7&version=ESV), but they do not share apostolic authority with the Twelve any more than the [Seventy-Two](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10&version=ESV) or [Justus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1%3A23-26&version=ESV) or any of the rest of Jesus' disciples.
1.6.1.2. Con: In [1 Timothy 2:12-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+2%3A12-14&version=ESV), the Apostle Paul justifies his claim that women ought not teach or exercise authority over men by showing that man was created first. Paul's basis for making a distinction in roles is God's created design.
1.6.2. Con: Many polytheistic traditions, that have existed longer on earth than monotheistic, recognize and respect the existence of [transgender people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_people_and_religion).
1.6.2.1. Pro: Many cultures have revered or honored non-binary individuals. Some examples are several [Native American groups](http://www.firstpeople.us/articles/the-two-spirit-people-of-indigenous-north-americans.html),  the [native Hawaiians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81h%C5%AB) , [the Incans](https://sites.psu.edu/evolutionofhumansexuality/2014/02/19/third-genders-new-concept-or-old/) , [Ugandans before colonization](https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/learn/terms), [The people of Madagascar](http://disinfo.com/2013/03/third-fourth-and-fifth-genders-in-cultures-around-the-world/), [the Skoptsy](http://disinfo.com/2013/03/third-fourth-and-fifth-genders-in-cultures-around-the-world/) \( a Christian religion\) in Russia.  By only looking at the religions found in modern day, the rest of history is being ignored.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: The Hawaiians make a different distinction. The issue here is whether gender is fluid, with which [the linked article](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/28/hawaiian-culture-transgender_n_7158130.html) disagrees: “Māhū is the expression of the third self... It is not a gender, it’s not an orientation, it’s not a sect, it’s not a particular demographic and it’s definitely not a race. "
1.6.3. Con: While religion is in fact relevant, God creating women and men to complement each other refers to physique, not the psychology of gender. Men's and women's bodies complement each other - as in they are designed to reproduce and keep the human race from going extinct.
1.6.3.1. Con: Men and women also think in different and complementary [ways](https://www.focusonthefamily.com/marriage/gods-design-for-marriage/why-are-men-like-waffles-why-are-women-like-spaghetti/god-designed-men-and-women-to-be-different-in-many-ways). We benefit greatly from creating a team with a person of the opposite sex.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.17.3.13.1.2.2.
1.6.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.10.6.2.
1.6.4. Con: Religion is a cultural system of behaviors, developed by humans to organize societies. Thus it is constructed, and so are the teachings of each religious belief.
1.6.5. Con: The words 'belief' and 'faith' common in religious discourse suggest a lack of real evidence to back up religious beliefs about gender, which were constructed by humans and tended to buttress an existing hierarchy. Nowadays, despite declining religious adherence, they continue to be used to reinforce a hierarchy that those who would benefit would like to see continue - and of course beliefs about gender differences differ even among religions, depending on how fundamentalist they are.
1.6.6. Con: The number is irrelevant. They all came directly from Judaism. They are, up to a point, the exact same religion.
1.6.7. Pro: Catholic people believe men and women in a heterosexual marriage are the [normal and natural](http://www.foryourmarriage.org/catholic-marriage/church-teachings/between-man-and-woman/) sexual relationship and basis for the family, rooted in God’s plan for creation.
1.6.7.1. Con: Both normal and natural are social contracts, further, they are ones that we only grab at when it convinces us. As glasses are unnatural and bad eye sight abnormal, nobody objects to this because nobody would profit from doing so.
1.6.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.16.1.4.
1.6.7.3. Con: Families can exist in all constellations \(gay couple, single mother, co-parenting\). Procreation works whenever a female egg is inseminated irrespective of the social construct around it.
1.6.7.4. Con: Given we cannot be sure that God exists, we should not base our understanding of sexual relations on religious beliefs.
1.6.7.5. Pro: Gender roles are natural. [Gender theory](http://www.kirkcenter.org/index.php/bookman/article/the-absurdity-of-gender-theory/) is just a dangerous invention that denies the ["order of creation”.](http://www.crisismagazine.com/2015/freedom-creative-becomes-freedom-create-oneself)
1.6.7.5.1. Con: The "order of creation" is just valid for christians believers and it is not a scientific fact, therefore it does not have anything to do with the gender theory identity.
1.6.7.5.2. Pro: Gender theory [harms children](https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/gender-ideology-harms-children) because it aims at depriving them of their gender identity.
1.6.7.5.2.1. Con: This article is published by The American Academy of Pediatrics \(AAP\), a scission from the American College of Pediatricians \(ACP\) - the largest pediatrics organization in the US - which has being labelled as an [anti-LGBT](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/political-minds/201705/the-american-college-pediatricians-is-anti-lgbt-group) hate group by some associations and has been criticized by experts for promoting “false claims and misleading scientific reports”.
1.6.7.5.2.1.1. Pro: Among their [ideas](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/political-minds/201705/the-american-college-pediatricians-is-anti-lgbt-group), they have supported reparative therapy for homosexuals; issued a non-peer-reviewed report to dispute that same-sex parents were good parents and, as quoted, they claim that affirming trans youth's identities is harmful.
1.6.7.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.18.1.1.2.
1.6.7.5.2.3. Con: Whilst the [cited article](https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/gender-ideology-harms-children) does indeed make the claim that 'gender ideology harms children', it itself states that gender is a sociological and psychological concept and not an objective biological one.
1.6.7.5.2.4. Pro: According to the Catholic Church, [children will be taught](https://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/23780-scotland-child-overseers-to-push-homosexuality-gender-confusion) that it is normal to be “preoccupied with gender” and to engage in “risk taking” and “rule-breaking". This means that children will be encouraged to become transgender or homosexuals.
1.6.7.5.2.4.1. Con: Children will only be encouraged to search in themselves their own identity so they don't suffer from a forced one. There is no teaching that will make them homosexual or transgender, it is only about living in harmony with oneself.
1.6.7.5.2.4.2. Con: According to the article, children will be taught "that homosexuality and bisexuality are normal". In the US, 20% of millenials identify as [LGBTQ](http://www.glaad.org/files/aa/2017_GLAAD_Accelerating_Acceptance.pdf), thus those sexual orientations are statistically normal.
1.6.7.5.2.5. Con: Denying children the possibility to express their gender is what harms them: gender non-conforming children are at higher risk of depression, anxiety and in some cases even [suicide](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160831110833.htm).
1.6.7.5.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.5.1.
1.6.7.5.2.5.2. Pro: Countries like [Canada](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/06/04/ontario-becomes-first-province-to-ban-conversion-therapy-for-lgbtq-children.html) are starting to pass legislation that forbid any sort of conversion therapy, including those that seek to change a child’s gender identity.
1.6.7.5.2.6. Con: The article claims hormone treatments make transgender adults permanently [sterile](https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolynkylstra/transgender-fertility?utm_term=.eiw42YQ43#.rovxo0XxJ), something that is not true.
1.6.7.5.2.7. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.5.5.
1.6.7.5.2.8. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.5.6.2.
1.6.7.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.5.
1.6.7.5.4. Pro: The perception of gender as a social construct is a [threat to the natural family](https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2016/10/01/pope-calls-gender-theory-global-war-family/), as it negates sexual differences.
1.6.7.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.16.
1.6.7.5.4.2. Con: Many differences between women and men have no ground in their biologies but are cultural products.
1.6.7.5.4.3. Con: Understanding gender as a social construct doesn't necessarily negate sexual differences. It just rejects the idea of a culturally determined set of roles and fixed identities.
1.6.7.5.4.4. Con: There is no such thing as a natural family; in fact, [multiple types of families](https://sociologytwynham.com/2008/06/09/families-and-households/) exist throughout the world. In fact, family structures [vary across countries](http://worldfamilymap.ifstudies.org/2015/articles/world-family-indicators/family-structure), indicating how family structures are also a cultural product rather than being rooted in any innate biological consideration.
1.6.7.5.5. Con: This theory comes from a Catholic Church's effort to undermine the idea of mutable gender identities, preaching the existence of a "gender ideology" that would be using hidden means in order to "[destroy Christian faith and morality](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/gender-ideology-is-destructive-anti-human-and-must-be-opposed-ukrainian-gre), as well as universal human values".
1.6.7.5.5.1. Pro: This conspiracy theory aims at delegitimatising the research on gender equality and LGBT communities.
1.6.7.5.5.1.1. Pro: The Catholic church still calls [homosexuality a sin](https://www.catholic.com/tract/homosexuality).
1.6.7.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: Several Catholic factions in Africa, for example,[openly promote homophobia](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-01-26-in-god-we-hate-new-report-says-african-churches-to-blame-for-homophobia/) as an essential tenet of their faith.
1.6.7.5.5.1.1.2. Pro: [The Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/BornFreeAndEqualLowRes.pdf) states that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, therefore homophobic attitudes expose many LGBT people of all ages and in all regions of the world to egregious violations of their human rights.
1.6.7.5.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: The [Yogyakarta Principles](http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/) were developed to address the abuse of the rights of LGBT people and provide an interpretive aid to the application of human rights law.
1.6.7.5.6. Pro: Gender is a natural division among humans and animals to procreate and sustain life. Without gender division, the human race will cease to exist.
1.6.7.5.6.1. Con: This view presumes that gender and biosex are the same thing when they are separate concepts. Biosex differentiation is necessary for reproduction, but artificially restricted gender roles are unnecessary.
1.6.7.5.6.2. Con: Actually, there is no proof for this claim. A more than binary gender conception does not necessarily have an impact on the reproductive desire of individuals.
1.6.7.5.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.6.3.1.1.
1.6.7.5.6.3. Con: Futurists estimate that [ectogenesis](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/artificial-wombs-are-coming-and-the-controversys-already-here) will be widely used in 20-30 years.
1.6.7.5.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.7.5.2.4.
1.6.7.5.6.5. Con: Women will continue to give birth if they wish to have children. The breakdown of the gender division simply eliminates constraints upon women that force them to take the dominant parental role.
1.6.7.5.7. Con: The Catholic order of creation as a binary gender denies the fact that approximately [1 in 1500](http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency) children are born with atypical genitalia and are considered intersex.
1.6.7.5.8. Con: Gender is a social construct, but that doesn't mean it's an invention.
1.6.7.5.8.1. Pro: Even if we agree that something is a social construct it still heavily [affects](https://jmtrom.blogspot.de/2011/07/social-construction-and-reality.html) the lives of people in a particular society.
1.6.7.5.8.2. Pro: Money is a social construct. We share a belief that pieces of paper or electronic information have value and we can exchange them for actual goods and services.
1.6.7.5.9. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.
1.6.7.6. Con: -> See 1.6.7.5.4.4.
1.6.7.7. Con: -> See 1.2.8.12.1.7.
1.6.8. Con: Gender principles of these monotheistic religions are archaic and irrelevant.
1.6.8.1. Pro: These religions say a lot of things, many of which [do not align with our current understanding of the physical world.](http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-39.htm)
1.6.8.2. Pro: Many believers do not take scriptures literally.
1.6.8.2.1. Con: The popularity of an article of faith is not a sufficient test criterion for its truthfulness and relevance.
1.6.8.2.2. Pro: Even fundamentalist Christians [do not take the Bible literally.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-mcswain/fundamentalist-christians_b_4999800.html)
1.6.8.2.2.1. Con: Rather than concede that difficult statements in the Bible must be figurative, such as the command to stone children, [online sources](http://biblehub.com/commentaries/deuteronomy/21-21.htm) show that fundamentalist Christians tend to find a literal interpretations that are more easily acceptable.
1.6.9. Pro: The fact that all three monotheistic religions hold this view lends it credence.
1.6.9.1. Con: There are way more monotheistic religions than three, and each of them have zero impact on anything being true or false.
1.6.9.1.1. Pro: Only empirical methods can prove whether or not something is true.
1.6.9.1.1.1. Pro: To note that there are many things that are considered true that cant be empirically proven - such as "unicorns are not real" - this doesn't immediately disqualify them as truths.
1.6.9.2. Con: This origin story is not relevant to the gender identities of those who do not subscribe to Christianity, Judaism, or Islam.
1.6.9.2.1. Pro: This conception of man and women as created differently is not the case in many other religions. That it is advanced by those three scriptures just reflects that the Abrahamic religions are not independently originating and instead share the same genesis text.
1.6.9.2.2. Con: One is unlikely to not interact with someone, across a lifetime, with beliefs in one of those three religions. This interaction must involve interacting with their beliefs.
1.6.9.2.2.1. Con: Non-believers can respectfully interact with people holding those beliefs, however, that does not mean those beliefs would have a significant impact on the lives of non-believers.
1.6.9.2.2.1.1. Pro: Likewise, believers should interact respectfully with non-believers in their interactions, as their faith is no more or less legitimate than the non-believers'.
1.6.9.3. Con: Monotheistic texts support many practices, [such as slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery), that humanity has since abandoned.
1.6.9.4. Con: This is [argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) - a fallacious argument appealing to popularity.
1.6.9.5. Con: The three monotheistic religions share a common history, so it is unsurprising that they would share a concept of fixed and binary gender.
1.6.9.5.1. Pro: Their common history has led to them being collectively labeled the [Abrahamic](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religion) religions, and thus it is unsurprising that these views are extremely similar.
1.6.10. Con: If God did create male and females, it means he also created all the LGBTQ people since, [according to John 1: 3,](http://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm) there was nothing that wasn't made by him.
1.6.10.1. Pro: While it is true that the Bible claims God created all humans, it also reveals that He gave them a free will to choose \([Galatians 5:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5:16-17&version=ESV)\), which would include what to believe about gender definition and self identification.
1.6.10.1.1. Con: The Bible makes claims throughout that man's will is subject to God's will. In the Bible, man does not have a truly "free" will but a relative will.
1.6.10.1.2. Con: [Galatians 5:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5:16-17&version=ESV) does not teach free will. Rather, it teaches that what we "want to do" is of the flesh, implying that many of our desires \(such as our desire to identify as a different gender\) are actually contrary to God's desires. This passage also teaches that the only way we can keep from gratifying the desires of the flesh is by the power of the Spirit of God, which indwells Christians \([Acts 2:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2:38&version=ESV)\).
1.6.10.2. Con: God's creation of people is not the same as God's creation or assent to their behavior.
1.6.10.3. Pro: "In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them." This passage, from Genesis 1:27, has sometimes been taken to mean that God does not have just one gender.
1.6.10.3.1. Pro: References to biblical eunuchs as a third sex/gender category further supports the idea that Judaism and early Christianity did not view maleness and femaleness as the only options God allowed for, nor were maleness and femaleness viewed as innate and unchangeable.
1.6.10.3.1.1. Con: Biblical references to eunuchs, such as [Matthew 19:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19%3A12&version=ESV), do not suggest that eunuchs were a type of third gender. The context of [Matthew 19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19&version=ESV) is about divorce, implying that comments about eunuchs were more about celibacy than transgenderism.
1.6.10.3.2. Con: Even if this interpretation is granted, it does not give credence to either gender fluidity or the distinction between gender identity and biological sex. All it would prove is that God is neither genders, or both.
1.6.10.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.5.4.1.
1.6.11. Pro: There are a vast number of people, [approximately](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/) 2.2 billion Christians \(32% of the world’s population\), 1.6 billion Muslims \(23%\), and 14 million Jews \(0.2%\), who believe in this origin story.
1.6.11.1. Con: There is no scientific proof for the origin story.
1.6.11.1.1. Pro: There is also a large amount of scientific proof discrediting the origin story.
1.6.11.2. Con: The [argument from popularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) is a logical fallacy.
1.6.11.3. Con: -> See 1.6.8.2.
1.6.11.4. Con: The number of people who hold such beliefs does not support the beliefs' validity.
1.6.11.4.1. Pro: [Argument from Popularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum) is an explicit logical fallacy. The number of \(not specifically expert\) people who believe in something is not evidence for or against the truth of something.
1.6.11.4.2. Pro: The scientific method is the only means to prove the validity and truthfulness of something, and it is more important and independent of people's beliefs or opinions.
1.6.11.5. Con: This still leaves a very sizeable minority who should not have those views imposed upon them.
1.6.11.5.1. Pro: This [includes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations) 1.2 billion \(16%\) who are unaffiliated \(atheists, agnostics, deists\), 1.15 billion \(15%\) Hindus, 521 million \(7%\) Buddhists, 394 million \(5.50%\) adherents of traditional Chinese religions, and many others, totaling just under half of the world's population, who do not adhere to these views.
1.7. Pro: Gender categorization only exists through the societal attribution of specific behaviors as indicating a specific gender identity, as at the individual level the internal conception of one's identity does not need labels.
1.7.1. Con: The idea that gender is a social construct devalues the importance of gender to individual identity.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Saying that a key part of one's identity is determined by social forces \(even if true in-part\) denies that individual a sense of agency and control over their self-actualisation.
1.7.1.2. Pro: While gender categories may be broadly socially constructed, variation within those categories is immense and largely driven by personal choices; including the choice to present or perform gender in a manner that runs contrary to the prevalent norms of society.
1.7.1.3. Con: Even if this is true, it is not a reason for why gender is not a social construct. Gender can be a social construct even if it does devalue the importance of it to people's individual identity.
1.7.1.4. Pro: It is important to recognize that it is possible that a woman may not be able to do everything a man can do, but perhaps she can do everything a man can’t do. For that, their sex demands a respect equal to that of men and unique to women alone.
1.7.2. Con: Internal conception usually involves describing yourself in words. These words are labels.
1.7.3. Con: “Gender” is in-part [a theoretical decoupling by feminist scholars](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15146141) of biological sex and social characteristics.  The internal conception of sexual identity is [seeded during pre-natal gestation](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM197905313002201) - giving rise to [post-natal temperamental & personality differences](https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877042812017168/1-s2.0-S1877042812017168-main.pdf?_tid=cbeaeb55-2b46-459c-a977-63c76773987f&acdnat=1521838464_5b578f729d6cfee61ce9d6c30a4d0df1) between the biological sexes.
1.7.3.1. Con: Temperamental studies in adulthood that show sex differences cannot be used to claim these differences are innate since socialization over at least 20 years has taken place.
1.7.4. Con: Not everyone "does" gender in the same way, meaning there has to be some internal process that shapes gender expression.
1.7.4.1. Pro: A person's experience and understanding of their gender may well intersect with other aspects of their identity, such as race, class, sexual orientation, age, ability or religion. This could account for the changes in the expression of gender identity.
1.7.4.1.1. Con: If a person's understanding of their gender is shaped by variable aspects that change over time, that means gender as an identity must also change over time.
1.7.4.2. Con: Differences in expression of gender are not necessarily proof of an internal process. This could equally be attributable to variations in social experiences.
1.7.5. Pro: Many people adopt behaviors that do not feel natural to them because they believe those are the behaviors that members of their gender ought do.
1.7.5.1. Con: This is a natural and general sociological/psychological response. People adapt naturally to behaviour that is seen as acceptable in their personal context. In the same way that children learn that they should not punch others \(as it is socially undesirable\) people in general adapt to how their peers behave, as humans strive to behave according to socially constructed norms. This is not a problematic phenomenon.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: Children learn from what they see, whether the actions are positive or negative. [The Bobo doll experiment](https://www.simplypsychology.org/bobo-doll.html) is a great example.
1.7.5.2. Pro: When we do gender [we are held accountable](https://www.jstor.org/stable/189945?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) by those around us. When we fail to "correctly" do gender with others, we may be met with a subtle or overt punishment or exclusion.
1.7.6. Pro: For [social constructivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender), individuals can create meaning only in relation to what they are exposed to in their environment. In this sense, the individual and society are inextricably linked.
1.7.6.1. Pro: [Harold Garfinkel's chapter "Agnes"](https://books.google.it/books?id=OEghxsmGI9cC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=agnes+garfinkel+text&source=bl&ots=Zg6m2RrBvv&sig=pR_wa9kvxoOr3jsoRetDMA_qUAM&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWl7edpeDYAhXFXSwKHXhbCakQ6AEIazAL#v=onepage&q=agnes%20garfinkel%20text&f=false) shows how gender is produced through interaction, and how even "taken for granted" physical attributes that define sex cannot be considered as biological pre-social data.
1.7.6.2. Pro: All types of identities are [fluid, multidimensional and personalized](http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/pub/eres/SOC217_PIMENTEL/frable.pdf) social constructions that reflect the individual’s current context and socio-historical cohort.
1.7.6.3. Pro: Social identity [theory](http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/pub/eres/SOC217_PIMENTEL/frable.pdf) holds that individual and group social identities are formed out of the competition between hegemonic and individual identities.
1.7.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.4.6.1.
1.7.7. Pro: There is a [human need to label people](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/sermonsfromthemound/2014/08/why-do-we-need-labels/), indicating that all social echelons and categorizations \(including gender\) are social constructs.
1.7.7.1. Pro: An example of how gender is socially constructed are the Masculine and the Feminine [Gender Identity Scale](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40216548?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), as the scale indicates that peoples genders can exist anywhere on a spectrum.
1.7.7.2. Con: Certain aspects of the classification of gender are rooted in differences in sex chromosomes and, therefore, are observations of biological differences.
1.7.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.10.
1.7.7.3. Pro: The way gender is constructed for an individual depends on [gendered interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender) the individual has with others, as well as other identities or roles they may have \(race, class, sexuality\).
1.7.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.3.
1.7.7.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.18.4.
1.7.8. Con: Social psychology argues that one's [self-concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept) is made up of one's self-schemas, and interacts with self-esteem, self-knowledge, and the social self to form the self as whole. This means that self-labelling starts internally and society plays only a partial role in this process.
1.7.8.1. Con: The labels one uses for self-labelling must always be in reference to society's definitions, lest they have no practical meaning. Therefore they are determined by society.
1.7.8.2. Pro: The most fundamental question of existence, "Who am I?", indicates that at an individual level labels may be the most important thing.
1.7.8.2.1. Pro: It is virtually impossible to think without labels \(i.e. words\). Being generous can be an extremely important aspect of a person, but impossible to grasp without the word "generous".
1.7.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.6.4.
1.7.8.4. Con: As long as society plays any part in one's self-labelling, the self-concept will change since society changes over time.
1.7.8.4.1. Con: Self-labels can be anchored in objective reality. The label "short" can be changed by society, but 1.7m can not.
1.7.8.4.1.1. Con: However, the interpretation of that physical reality is constructed. Being considered short has changed over [time](https://ourworldindata.org/human-height/) and it also changes among [countries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10942348) as the average height can be very different.
1.7.8.4.2. Pro: Though self-labels may be anchored in objective reality, social influence is pervasive. 1.7m is an objective fact, but the self-label of "short" depends on surroundings. A society of people who are predominantly 1.9m or 1.5 m will radically alter this self-concept.
1.7.9. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
