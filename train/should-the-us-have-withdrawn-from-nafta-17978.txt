Discussion Title: Should the US have withdrawn from NAFTA?

1. It would have been in the interests of the US to withdraw from NAFTA.
1.1. Con: Withdrawing from NAFTA would have been harmful to the US economy.
1.1.1. Pro: It is estimated that [300,000](https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/16/news/economy/trump-nafta-withdraw-impact/index.html) US jobs would have been lost as a result of leaving NAFTA.
1.1.1.1. Pro: As many as [six million](http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/naftas-impact-u-s-economy-facts/) US jobs are dependent on trade with Mexico. NAFTA has been instrumental in facilitating this.
1.1.1.2. Pro: The US textile industry is [highly reliant](http://tradeleadershipcoalition.org/nafta-is-critical-to-the-success-of-u-s-textiles/) on NAFTA's continued existence. In this industry, the US enjoys a bilateral trade surplus of $4 billion.
1.1.2. Con: Uncertainty over whether NAFTA will last or not prevents companies from forming long term trade plans. It is better to withdraw from NAFTA, so that companies can know which rules they have to trade over, rather than constantly fight over an agreement that may end in a few months.
1.1.2.1. Con: A strong commitment to remain in NAFTA would resolve this uncertainty more effectively than a decision to withdraw, which would leave the future terms of trade unclear, just as in the case of [Brexit](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/26/brexit-uncertainty-putting-860000-jobs-at-risk-warns-car-industry).
1.1.2.1.1. Con: The confusion and uncertainly surrounding Brexit was, to a large extent, [caused](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/02/theresa-may-brexit-mess) by the UK Government. Leaving NAFTA would allow the US government the opportunity to provide certainty as to what will happen next.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: No one would know what would come next, causing uncertainty in the short term, particularly from investors.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The US cannot simply avoid uncertainty with a firm decision. Withdrawal from NAFTA would necessitate a lengthy negotiation period regarding future trade arrangements, during which time uncertainty would severely disrupt markets.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: NAFTA requires a [6 month](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/business/economy/what-would-happen-if-the-us-withdrew-from-nafta.html) period to notify the other parties of any plan to withdraw, allowing time for NAFTA to remain in place while a new agreement is being made. This would reduce the harms of uncertainty.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Six months is very little time to negotiate a complex multilateral trade arrangement. [Brexit](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2018/06/06/britain-continues-to-make-a-mess-of-brexit-but-the-eu-has-mishandled-it-too/) has been underway for more than two years and no deal has been reached.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Uncertainty around renegotiations would hit Mexico even more [severely](https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-gdp-shrinks-nafta-uncertainty-disasters/4094325.html) than the US. This would increase the number of people forced out of Mexico due to poor economic conditions.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: The 0.2% drop in Mexico's GDP cited in the above article is not necessarily correlated with uncertainty over NAFTA. The fact that industries such as [car manufacturing](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/uncertainty-over-nafta-hasnt-stopped-mexicos-car-manufacturing-cities-from-thriving/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all), which are most reliant on NAFTA, are thriving indicates that the effect of uncertainty is minimal.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: The peso sank [1.5%](https://www.ft.com/content/9fd58328-b04e-11e8-8d14-6f049d06439c) upon negative news about the future of NAFTA emerging. This will become worse the greater the uncertainty.
1.1.3. Pro: Leaving NAFTA would reduce America's GDP by [0.5%](https://www.ft.com/content/b0f343aa-ab3a-3657-8b57-f0086cfaa006), costing billions of dollars.
1.1.3.1. Con: GDP is an increasingly [inaccurate](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/04/30/the-trouble-with-gdp) measure of an economies prosperity. A reduction in GDP may not be as damning as it appears.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: While GDP is not a perfect measure of prosperity, it does indicate whether an economy is growing or shrinking. If one variable can be shown to shrink the economy, it is very likely it will have other harmful effects.
1.1.4. Pro: Immigration is a valuable driver of economic growth.
1.1.4.1. Pro: [Eight](https://theconversation.com/why-care-about-undocumented-immigrants-for-one-thing-theyve-become-vital-to-key-sectors-of-the-us-economy-98790) million of the estimated eleven million illegal immigrants in the U.S. currently work and contribute to the US economy.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Leaving NAFTA won't stop illegal immigrants entering the US or working there illegally.
1.1.4.2. Pro: NAFTA facilitates the immigration of Mexican and Canadian professionals and investors through the TN and E [visas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/employment/visas-canadian-mexican-nafta-professional-workers.html) respectively.
1.1.4.3. Pro: Immigration facilitated by NAFTA is essential for America's healthcare system. TN visas allow Canadian and Mexican healthcare professionals to commute cross-border easily. [\(Walker, pp.1-2\)](https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TN-Visas.NFAP-Policy-Brief.April-2018.pdf)
1.1.4.3.1. Con: It is possible to formulate immigration exemptions for specific highly valuable professions outside of the framework of NAFTA.
1.1.4.4. Pro: A high level of low-skilled migrant workers from Mexico is beneficial for the American economy.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: The fact that a certain level is helpful does not mean that an uncontrolled amount of illegal immigration is helpful to the US economy.
1.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: NAFTA has led to an increase in illegal immigration from Mexico.
1.1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: America is economically much better off than Mexico; there will always be illegal immigration regardless of NAFTA.
1.1.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: The inequality in agricultural subsidies and free trade in agricultural commodities has led to financial loss of Mexican agricultural workers in Mexico, forcing them to illegally emigrate to America in order to find employment \([Luckstead, 2](http://www.eldis.org/document/A61876)\).
1.1.4.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Unlike predictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/weekinreview/18uchitelle.html) before NAFTA was implemented, Mexican farmers did not diversify from corn to other grains or fruits.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3. Con: The [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_peso_crisis) and devaluation of the peso, unrelated to the implementation of NAFTA, caused the increase in illegal immigration \([Papademetriou, 40](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/naftas-promise-and-reality-lessons-mexico-hemisphere)\).
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: If US withdrawal from NAFTA [devastates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2017/10/31/nafta-exit-way-worse-for-mexico-than-u-s/) the Mexican economy, it could fuel more illegal immigration to the US.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: A US withdrawal from NAFTA would have devastating effects on the Mexican economy.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Only [2.4%](https://fpif.org/5-reasons-mexican-workers-cheer-demise-nafta/) of Mexican jobs depend on exports.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: [Oxford Economics](https://www.ft.com/content/b0f343aa-ab3a-3657-8b57-f0086cfaa006) estimates the value of the Peso would fall by 8%.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: A devaluation of the peso could benefit the Mexican economy by [reducing](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090215/3-reasons-why-countries-devalue-their-currency.asp) interest rates on sovereign debt repayments.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: 85% of Mexico's debt is denominated in pesos, and the cost of interest on all of this debt would [decline](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-debt-idUSKBN16V0J5) as the value of the peso did.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.2. Pro: A devaluation of the peso could cause regional financial instability throughout Central America, [as happened](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tequilaeffect.asp) when the peso's value collapsed in the mid-1990s.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con: The mid-1990's crisis was induced by a nearly 50% devaluation of the Peso. An 8% dip, as predicted above, would not have the same negative effects.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.3. Con: A devaluation of the peso would reduce the price of Mexican goods abroad, helping to boost trade.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.1. Con: This devaluation would also make imports more expensive for Mexican citizens, making goods and services more expensive.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Mexico's largest import is [electrical machinery](http://www.worldstopexports.com/mexicos-top-10-imports/): an increase in the cost could therefore harm businesses which rely on information or manufacturing technology, negatively impacting domestic output.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.1.2. Pro: As Mexico runs an overall [trade deficit](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/balance-of-trade), this effect would be more harmful than the benefits derived from cheap exports.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.1.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: It is predicted that the Mexican economy would [shrink](https://www.ft.com/content/b0f343aa-ab3a-3657-8b57-f0086cfaa006) by 2% by 2022 and it's growth in 2019 would be reduced by 0.9 percentage points.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.4. Pro: Many companies such as [Ford](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-30/what-might-happen-to-mexico-if-nafta-gets-wiped-away-quicktake) that use Mexico to manufacture goods for export to the US will choose to move the factories elsewhere out of fears of high tariffs.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.5. Con: Tariff free produce from the US has decimated [5 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-30/what-might-happen-to-mexico-if-nafta-gets-wiped-away-quicktake) agriculture jobs in Mexico; without NAFTA, Mexican producers would find it easier to stay profitable, employing more people.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.5.1. Con: Foreign competition only causes job loss when domestic production is too inefficient to compete. The removal of US competition would lead to the re-emergence of wasteful and inefficient agricultural practices in Mexico and would not be of benefit to the overall economy.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.5.1.1. Con: US agricultural produce is not cheap because it is produced more efficiently than in Mexico, but rather because it is [subsidised](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/02/12/milking-taxpayers) to a huge extent by the state. This prevents Mexican farmers from competing fairly.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.5.1.2. Con: Mexico is party to a [large number](http://www.promexico.gob.mx/en/mx/tratados-comerciales) of other free trade agreements, and domestic producers would therefore still have to contend with foreign competition.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.5.2. Pro: The 2002 Farm Bill subsidised US crops by as much as [40%](https://www.thebalance.com/disadvantages-of-nafta-3306273). NAFTA's removal of tariffs has made it impossible for Mexican farmers to compete.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.5.3. Con: For these businesses to be profitable, they would have to charge higher prices for these goods than those offered through NAFTA, making it more expensive for consumers.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.6. Pro: [75%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2017/10/31/nafta-exit-way-worse-for-mexico-than-u-s/#38bef1914da0) of Mexico's exports are to US consumers.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.6.1. Con: Only [50%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/what-might-happen-to-mexico-if-nafta-gets-wiped-away-quicktake/2018/04/02/bc15962a-3684-11e8-af3c-2123715f78df_story.html?utm_term=.eb59557d9807) of these exports are included in NAFTA.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.7. Con: NAFTA has seen the growth of [Export Processing Zones](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/export-processing-zones-epz-2221273) where US companies locate near the boarder, hire Mexican workers and immediately ship goods back for sale in the U.S. Workers employed in this way have no labour rights or health [protections](https://www.thebalance.com/disadvantages-of-nafta-3306273).
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.7.1. Pro: NAFTA has lead to as many as [30%](https://www.thebalance.com/disadvantages-of-nafta-3306273) of the Mexican workforce being employed in these conditions.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.7.2. Con: Even if these workers do not have labour rights or health protections, they still have jobs that would be lost if the US left NAFTA.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.7.2.1. Con: Since EPZs have heavy tax exemptions, they use large amounts of Mexican labour and resources while channeling the proceeds out of the country. More jobs might be created in Mexico if the proceeds of Mexican industry were allowed to circulate in the domestic economy.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.7.2.2. Con: The majority of the benefits of EPZs flow to higher income workers. Those on lower incomes see very few benefits to either employment status or wages \([Picarelli, 320](https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0927537116300306/1-s2.0-S0927537116300306-main.pdf?_tid=d1ffdcc9-5f7b-4733-900f-81c5fd541914&acdnat=1537024037_a795e4b9da819d6f3d599b34a89f80ab)\).
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.7.3. Pro: Even where protections exist for workers in EPZs, they are easier to [flout](https://www.just-style.com/analysis/are-mexicos-maquila-labour-rights-worsening_id128988.aspx).
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.8. Con: Mexico has other trade agreements it can rely on.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.8.1. Pro: Mexico is in [negotiations](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/eu-mexico-trade-agreement/) for a trade deal with the EU.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.8.1.1. Con: EU-Mexico trade cannot be a substitute for US-Mexico trade. The distance between Mexico and the EU makes for substantially higher transport costs, limiting the profitability of transactions.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.8.2. Pro: Mexico recently signed a new [Trans-Pacific Partnership](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/29/nafta-talks-stalled-as-world-moves-on-without-u-s-lighthizer-freeland/) with nine other Pacific Rim nations including Canada which would offer alternative trade partners for Mexico.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.8.2.1. Con: The spending power of Latin American countries has [fallen](https://www.ft.com/content/d3272242-57d5-11e5-a28b-50226830d644) greatly recently meaning they will have less money to buy Mexican goods.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.8.3. Con: Those trade agreements are not mutually exclusive to NAFTA: in no scenario is the economic situation improved for Mexico without it.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.9. Con: Although employment has increased, this has not seen a rise in wage growth for the poorest, and has therefore increased inequality, meaning ordinary Mexicans have [not seen the benefits](http://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9563.html) of NAFTA.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.9.1. Con: [Studies](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42965.pdf) have shown that NAFTA has increased productivity and reduced consumer prices in Mexico. These processes are of overall benefit to consumers and the economy even if the agreement has not increased wages.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.9.2. Pro: This has increased wage inequality and harmed low skilled workers. It is wrong to allow some to benefit at the expense of poorer workers. [\(Nicita 2004, 2\)](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/491461468757218477/pdf/wps3265Mexico.pdf)
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.9.3. Pro: US companies that have entered Mexico since NAFTA's implementation have pushed for a lower standard of [labour rights](http://prospect.org/article/nafta-cross-border-disaster), reducing the quality of life for Mexican workers.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10. Con: The purpose of US trade policy is to vindicate American economic interests, not to ensure the health of the Mexican economy.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1. Con: Economic instability in Mexico could be significantly damaging to American interests.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1. Pro: Financial crises in Mexico have been linked to an [increase](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/naftas-promise-and-reality-lessons-mexico-hemisphere) in illegal immigration into the United States.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1. Con: Illegal immigration is not necessarily harmful to the American economy.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1.1. Con: Illegal immigration is highly [correlated](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swp2018-19.pdf) with increased support for the Republican party, especially reactionary candidates such as Donald Trump. The policies of such politicians have a destabilising effect on American politics which is likely bad for the economy.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [volatility](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-7-trigger-points-turned-stock-market-hope-into-fear-since-the-election-2018-04-12) of the US stock market hit an all time high in 2018. This was due in large part to negative reactions to scandals in the Trump administration.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The effect of political scandal is largely [confined](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/24/a-trump-impeachment-could-slam-stock-market-but-not-economy.html) to short term volatility in the stock market, which has little to do with the more important long term trajectory of the economy.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Trump and other anti-immigrant politicians routinely peddle [lies](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/18/17474232/trump-immigration-scam) about immigration to their base. They are likely to continue to do so in order to win votes regardless of actual immigration levels.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1.1.4. Con: The American economy is performing [strongly](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42748243) under Trump, with falling unemployment and high levels of growth.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1.2. Pro: Illegal immigration correlates with a [decrease](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/30/upshot/crime-immigration-myth.html) in crime, because immigrants face the deterrent of deportation.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1.3. Pro: Undocumented immigrants pay [substantial](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/undocumented-immigrants-and-their-contributions-tax-revenue/) amounts of tax while having limited access to public services, meaning they may contribute more to the economy than they cost.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1.3.1. Con: Although access to some services is limited, illegal immigrants do still benefit to varying extents from services such as water, police, rubbish collection, and road maintenance. Facilitating them is estimated to cost [$134.9 billion](https://fairus.org/issue/publications-resources/fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-united-states-taxpayers) annually.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: The medical costs for providing emergency treatment to uninsured illegal immigrants amounts to as much as [3.9 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2018/02/26/how-american-citizens-finance-health-care-for-undocumented-immigrants/#685dbe3612c4) every year.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1.4. Pro: Undocumented workers are often [willing](https://www.brookings.edu/essay/the-wall-the-real-costs-of-a-barrier-between-the-united-states-and-mexico/) to take on difficult or unpleasant jobs which citizens and documented immigrants are unwilling to do.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.2. Pro: Unemployment and economic desperation in Mexico contribute to the [growth](https://www.alternet.org/drugs/mexico-trapped-labor-force-fertile-recruiting-ground-drug-cartels) of violent cartels by providing them with a labour force.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.2.1. Pro: Mexican drug cartels [import](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/magazine/how-a-mexican-drug-cartel-makes-its-billions.html) illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin into the United States.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.2.1.1. Pro: These drugs cause tens of thousands of [deaths](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates) in the United States each year.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.2.2. Pro: Mexican cartels [operate](http://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/387066-americas-biggest-national-security-crisis-drug-wars) across the border in the United States, carrying out violence which threatens Americans.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.2.3. Pro: Cartel growth exacerbates the other consequences of economic instability in Mexico, because cartels further [damage](http://uk.businessinsider.com/drug-violence-and-economic-complexity-in-mexico-2016-3?r=US&IR=T) the Mexican economy.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.3. Pro: Mexico is an important market for American [exports](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/mexico). Economic damage to Mexico will result in a decline in these exports as American goods become more difficult to pay for.
1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.
1.1.4.4.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.10.1.1.1.
1.1.4.4.1.2. Con: NAFTA does not facilitate free movement of people, therefore it does not lead to an unregulated amount of immigrants entering the U.S. [\(Viano p.102\)](http://www.ubplj.org/index.php/dlj/article/download/355/384)
1.1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: While NAFTA may not have been designed to facilitate the free movement of labour, its overall impact has been to increase immigration.
1.1.4.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.1.2.
1.1.4.4.1.2.2. Pro: Free movement was [deliberately](https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1872&context=lbra) excluded from NAFTA due to the political unpalatability of unregulated immigration in the US.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: America could still allow Mexican workers to work within the US if they were beneficial to the economy.
1.1.4.4.3. Con: The number of visas issued through NAFTA is [tiny](https://qz.com/893438/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nafta-as-donald-trump-prepares-to-renegotiate-it/).
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: First generation Mexican immigrants contribute 4% of total US GDP, and up to 18% in sectors such as agriculture and fishing \([BBVA, 3](http://latinodonorcollaborative.org/migration-outlook/)\).
1.1.4.4.5. Pro: Mexican immigration is complementary to US demographic patterns: the ageing US population will require an influx of younger immigrants to fill labour gaps \([Cornelius, 5](https://usmex.ucsd.edu/_files/NAFTA-essays/nafta-essays.pdf)\).
1.1.4.5. Pro: Immigrants contribute disproportionately to economic growth in that they are [more likely](https://hbr.org/2016/10/immigrants-play-a-disproportionate-role-in-american-entrepreneurship) than native-born Americans to be entrepreneurs or inventors.
1.1.4.5.1. Pro: The rate of entrepreneurship has [declined](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.28.3.3) since the 2000s in the US and there have been significantly less start ups created. There is a need for immigrant entrepreneurs.
1.1.4.5.2. Con: This is less true of illegal immigrants who must avoid state attention, and so face a huge barrier starting their own legal business.
1.1.4.5.2.1. Con: [Substantial](https://www.forbes.com/sites/fernandafabian/2018/05/12/undocumented-entrepreneurs-rise-above-policy-making/#2b332f9d4ee4) numbers of undocumented immigrants are entrepreneurs, in spite of the barriers they face.
1.1.4.6. Pro: Research has found a direct positive [correlation](https://www.oecd.org/migration/OECD%20Migration%20Policy%20Debates%20Numero%202.pdf) between rates of migration and rates of economic growth.
1.1.5. Pro: Withdrawing from NAFTA would result in American consumers paying higher prices.
1.1.5.1. Pro: One [study](https://www.atkearney.com/retail/how-nafta-affects-us-retail?utm_medium=backlink&utm_source=NRF&utm_campaign=2018AmericasNAFTAretail) found that withdrawing from NAFTA would cost consumers an additional $5.3 billion annually.
1.1.5.2. Pro: When consumers face higher prices, they [tend](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/21/growth-hit-as-rising-prices-slowed-consumer-spending) to reduce spending on higher price items so they can focus on necessities. Reduced consumer spending on such goods results in shrinking revenues for businesses and job losses.
1.1.5.2.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.atkearney.com/retail/how-nafta-affects-us-retail?utm_medium=backlink&utm_source=NRF&utm_campaign=2018AmericasNAFTAretail) by ATKearney estimates that reduced consumer spending would impact revenues and shrink retailer margins by $10.5 billion annually. The study concludes this could put up to 128,000 jobs at risk.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Even if NAFTA is responsible for a drop in the wages of some Americans, the effective buying power of the wages of all Americans is increased when consumer prices are lower.
1.1.5.4. Pro: NAFTA withdrawal would increase food prices, since agriculture is one of the sectors most affected by NAFTA [\(Johnson](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R45018.pdf)\).
1.1.5.4.1. Pro: Price increases, particularly for necessities like food, impact the poorest the [hardest](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/inflation-may-hit-the-poor-hardest/).
1.1.5.5. Con: NAFTA has led to a reduction in the jobs available for some of the most vulnerable Americans. This is not an acceptable exchange for cheaper goods because their purchasing power has reduced dramatically more than the amount saved by most Americans.
1.1.5.5.1. Pro: NAFTA led to a reduction in manufacturing jobs.
1.1.5.5.1.1. Con: Although manufacturing jobs have declined, their drop has also correlated with the shock of China joining the World Trade Organisation, and the financial housing crisis beginning in 2007. It is [unfair](http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-is-nafta-is-it-good-for-america-2017-2?r=US&IR=T) to assume that NAFTA caused the losses.
1.1.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: Research by Robert Blecker suggests that U.S. manufacturing decline had more to do with imports from [China](http://fs2.american.edu/blecker/www/research/Blecker_NAFTA_2014.pdf) than from Mexico.
1.1.5.5.1.2. Con: The [decline](http://uk.businessinsider.com/canada-mexico-nafta-and-us-trade-deficit-in-charts-2017-10?r=US&IR=T) in manufacturing jobs also correlated with that of the EU and Japan, neither of which are in NAFTA.
1.1.5.5.1.3. Pro: NAFTA has seen [682,900](https://www.thebalance.com/disadvantages-of-nafta-3306273) jobs relocate across the Mexican border in order to avail of cheaper labour.
1.1.5.5.1.4. Pro: NAFTA has led to an [eighteen-fold](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2017/09/28/the-truth-is-nafta-has-damaged-canadas-auto-industry.html) increase in the automotive trade deficit: most cars are purchased in the US, but are manufactured in Mexico, meaning American jobs have moved across the border.
1.1.5.5.1.5. Pro: Traditional economic assumptions that job growth in export-orientated sectors and non-tradable sectors will outweigh job loss in import-orientated sectors have been challenged by the lack of recent evidence of this trend \([Autor, 37](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21906.pdf)\).
1.1.5.5.1.6. Pro: NAFTA has led to the displacement of industries which previously supported 879,280 American jobs between 1994-2002 \([Scott, 1](https://www.epi.org/files/page/-/old/briefingpapers/147/epi_bp147.pdf)\).
1.1.5.5.1.7. Pro: The decline in manufacturing jobs has been linked with the rise of [populism](https://www.ft.com/content/5557f806-5a75-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b) in the United States, which has had negative economic, political and social consequences.
1.1.5.5.1.8. Con: Withdrawing from NAFTA would not have led to manufacturing jobs returning to the US.
1.1.5.5.1.8.1. Con: Even if the jobs did not return, leaving NAFTA would have discouraged other companies from leaving.
1.1.5.5.1.8.1.1. Con: Leaving NAFTA would have encouraged more companies to leave by reducing the market for American exports.
1.1.5.5.1.8.2. Pro: Even if withdrawing from NAFTA resulted in the return of manufacturing to within US borders, it is [unlikely](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602869/manufacturing-jobs-arent-coming-back/) that manufacturing jobs would have returned to the regions and individuals that lost them. Automation has meant that developments in advanced manufacturing have not aided workers displaced by NAFTA.
1.1.5.5.1.8.3. Pro: It is likely manufacturers would not have moved jobs back to the US, but rather to [lower-cost factories](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/scrubbing-nafta-could-cost-more-30-000-u-s-auto-n706501) further away, such as China.
1.1.5.5.1.8.4. Pro: The tariffs on car imports from Mexico and Canada would [not have been enough](https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/nafta-math-may-not-add-up-to-more-us-auto-jobs/64154911) to incentivise companies to move jobs back to the US given the large manufacturing cost differential.
1.1.5.5.1.8.4.1. Pro: Tariffs on car imports could have actually [cost](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-19/trump-faces-growing-storm-over-car-tariffs-as-lobbying-ramps-up) American jobs by leading to the imposition of reciprocal tariffs on American cars sold abroad.
1.1.5.5.1.8.5. Pro: Even where Trump has cut [specific deals](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-carrier/more-layoffs-at-indiana-factory-trump-made-deal-to-keep-open-idUSKBN1F02TL) and offered tax breaks to keep jobs from leaving the US for Mexico, the companies in question have ultimately outsourced manufacturing there.
1.1.5.5.1.9. Con: The loss of jobs in the manufacturing sector has been offset by a rise in blue-collar jobs in the construction sector due to the growth of the Mexican finance sector \([DeLong, 14](https://usmex.ucsd.edu/_files/NAFTA-essays/nafta-essays.pdf)\).
1.1.5.5.1.9.1. Pro: In [total](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/mexico-nafta-trade/510008/), trade with Mexico has created almost five million jobs in the US.
1.1.5.5.1.10. Con: As manufacturing jobs are highly vulnerable to [automation](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/human-plus-machine-a-new-era-of-automation-in-manufacturing), it is beneficial for the future of the US economy for it to reorient away from manufacturing.
1.1.5.5.1.10.1. Con: Even automated factories still employ citizens and pay taxes to the government. Losing those industries would impact the economy negatively.
1.1.5.5.1.10.1.1. Con: The large amounts of unemployment which will occur once such jobs are automated will be [hugely damaging](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/29/one-third-of-us-workers-could-be-jobless-by-2030-due-to-automation.html) even if the factories continue to pay taxes. It is better to reorient the economy towards less easily automated jobs.
1.1.5.5.1.10.1.1.1. Pro: It may be [necessary](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Future%20of%20Organizations/Retraining%20and%20reskilling%20workers%20in%20the%20age%20of%20automation/Retraining-and-reskilling-workers-in-the-age-of-automation.ashx) to retrain workers to limit the damage caused by automation, a process which is helped by NAFTA's impact on manufacturing jobs in the US.
1.1.5.5.1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.8.2.
1.1.5.5.2. Pro: Even if the overall effect on jobs has been positive, NAFTA led to a decline in specific industries leaving workers in those fields extremely vulnerable.
1.1.5.5.2.1. Con: It is the government's role to [redistribute](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/economic-growth-part-2/3-1-how-does-the-government-redistribute-income-rJNi2) wealth. It is not necessary for all industries to benefit in equal measure from every single trade deal.
1.1.5.5.2.1.1. Pro: The wealth created in increased trade should have been funnelled towards re-skilling workers in declining industries. A failure to support these workers cannot be blamed on NAFTA, and would not have justified leaving.
1.1.5.5.2.2. Pro: [80%](https://www.thebalance.com/disadvantages-of-nafta-3306273) of all job losses were in manufacturing.
1.1.5.5.2.3. Pro: NAFTA led to a displacement \(i.e. lay-offs in one industry, not accounting for gains in other industries or future employment of those workers\) of 200,000 jobs a year to Mexico \([Hufbauer, 6](https://piie.com/sites/default/files/publications/pb/pb14-13.pdf)\).
1.1.5.5.3. Pro: The [diminishing marginal utility of income](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/12309/concepts/diminishing-marginal-utility-of-income-and-wealth/) means that those who lost all their income suffered far more than those who increased theirs by a small amount.
1.1.5.5.4. Con: Manufacturing jobs lost as a result of NAFTA will not return if the US withdraws. Higher costs will.
1.1.5.5.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.8.
1.1.6. Pro: US withdrawal from NAFTA may result in diplomatic and economic retaliation from Mexico and Canada which would harm the US economy.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Withdrawing from NAFTA would have been bad for Canada and Mexico.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.
1.1.6.1.2. Con: The US does not owe an obligation towards Canada and Mexico, and so this is not a relevant consideration.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Con: The economic outcomes of Mexico, Canada and the US are [highly](https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/mexico-united-states/) [correlated](https://www.businessinsider.com/try-to-spot-the-correlation-between-us-and-canadian-gdp-2011-2?IR=T). For instance, changes in GDP between Canada and the US are almost exactly correlated. Therefore, the US has significant reason to care about the economic impacts of a withdrawal from NAFTA on the Canadian and Mexican economies.
1.1.6.1.2.1.1. Con: This is far more likely to be a result of Mexican [dependence](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/trade-profile-mexico-focuses-united-states) on the US' economy, rather than US dependence on the Mexican.
1.1.6.1.2.2. Con: The US has a moral obligation towards Mexico because of the legacy of [American Imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_imperialism), which has stunted the economic growth of Mexico for centuries to the benefit of American capitalists.
1.1.6.1.2.2.1. Pro: Historians have argued that US action in the 1830s and 1840s took advantage of a young, independent and unstable Mexican government. In the process of a series of aggressive wars, Mexico lost around [half](http://www.austincc.edu/jdikes/Was%20the%20Mexican%20War%20an%20Exercise%20in%20American%20Imperialism.pdf) of its original land.
1.1.6.1.2.2.2. Pro: Under the rule of [Porfirio Diaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porfirio_D%C3%ADaz) \(1884-1911\), American investors extracted huge profits from Mexico's natural resources, while the Mexican people saw few of the benefits. American capital [owned](https://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1938040700#H2_2) 78 per cent of the Mexico's mines, 72 per cent of the smelters, 58 per cent of the oil, and 68 per cent of the rubber business.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3. Con: American Imperialism was not perpetrated by any Americans who live today. It is difficult to argue that the actions of past generations create a moral burden on the contemporary US.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1. Con: Even if it was not perpetrated by any living Americans, those Americans are better off from living in a country that received the benefits of American Imperialism.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1. Con: Many of the most vulnerable Americans, who have no moral responsibility for American imperialism, are directly harmed by NAFTA.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: The arrival of low-skilled immigrants willing to work cheaply [drives down wages](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216) for the unskilled Americans with whom they compete by undercutting them.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: It is also [unfair](https://fairus.org/issue/illegal-immigration/whats-wrong-illegal-immigration) on those who are attempting to migrate legally. They must wait longer because jobs and resources are stretched by illegal immigrants.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.1.1.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.2.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: This phenomenon is disproportionately harmful to the most economically vulnerable communities in America, including high-school dropouts, individuals from deprived areas and certain racial minorities.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: College and high school dropouts working in industries that depended heavily on tariff protections in place prior to NAFTA have seen wage growth [drop](https://news.virginia.edu/content/qa-uva-economists-study-identifies-naftas-winners-and-losers?utm_source=DailyReport&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=news) by as much as 17 percentage points relative to wage growth in unaffected industries.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.3.2. Pro: The impact of these losses were felt by [entire towns](http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-is-nafta-is-it-good-for-america-2017-2?r=US&IR=T) that depended on businesses that closed or moved since 1994.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: American manufacturing could never compete with cheap [foreign labour](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/world/asia/29iht-letter29.html), and the bulk of outsourcing has no connection to Mexico. These areas would always have gone into decline, regardless of NAFTA.
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.4. Con: Studies have found that the overall impact of immigration on American wages is [very low](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration).
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.5. Con: Even if immigration were to damage wages for a certain subset of Americans, its overall economic effects are consistently found to be [positive](https://www.brookings.edu/essay/the-wall-the-real-costs-of-a-barrier-between-the-united-states-and-mexico/).
1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: Crackdowns on undocumented immigrant populations are associated with [contractions](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2016/08/25/wage-war) in the overall value of the economy.
1.1.6.1.2.3. Pro: The American government is accountable to the interests of American voters, as it is from them that it draws its legitimacy.
1.1.6.1.2.3.1. Con: Many American voters have a vested interest in [Canada](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/letters/july-4-a-million-people-in-canada-can-vote-in-the-us-election-plus-other-letters-to-the-editor/article30729582/) and [Mexico](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/mexico-election-2018/2018/05/08/number-mexicans-voting-abroad-falls-way-short-expectations-again).
1.1.6.1.2.3.1.1. Con: The American population elected Donald Trump, who [explicitly](http://uk.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-nafta-tpp-trade-speech-2016-6) campaigned against NAFTA in 2016.
1.1.6.1.2.3.2. Pro: Trump's mandate is based upon putting [America first](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-38698654/donald-trump-america-first-america-first).
1.1.6.1.2.3.2.1. Con: The majority of Americans [believe](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/13/americans-generally-positive-about-nafta-but-most-republicans-say-it-benefits-mexico-more-than-u-s/) that NAFTA is good for the US, and therefore withdrawing from it is inconsistent with that mandate.
1.1.6.1.2.3.2.1.1. Con: This is no longer the case. Now fewer than a [third](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/400132-poll-fewer-than-1-in-3-americans-think-nafta-is-beneficial) of US citizens support NAFTA.
1.1.6.1.2.3.3. Pro: Fewer than a [third](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/400132-poll-fewer-than-1-in-3-americans-think-nafta-is-beneficial) of US citizens think that NAFTA is good for their country.
1.1.6.1.2.4. Con: The US has the same moral obligations Mexicans and Canadians as it does to its own citizens. The only reason that Mexicans are Mexicans, Canadians are Canadians and Americans are Americans is due to an [accident of birth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery_of_birth).
1.1.6.1.2.4.1. Con: The fact that it is an accident of birth that a child has one set of parents rather than another does not mean that the parents of a child do not owe that child a greater obligation.
1.1.6.1.2.4.2. Pro: While we may provide more help to some people than others, our shared humanity creates an obligation not to harm [anyone](https://philosiblog.com/2011/11/06/if-we-find-we-cannot-help-others-the-least-we-can-do-is-to-desist-from-harming-them/). Decimating the economies of Canada and Mexico would breach this duty.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: The Mexican government has been clear that it wants NAFTA to [continue](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-23/mexico-said-to-push-for-nafta-deal-with-trump-by-end-of-august). A U.S withdrawal thus undermines their sovereign wishes.
1.1.6.1.3.1. Con: Treaties are consensual: they require the agreement of both parties to be legitimate.
1.1.6.1.4. Pro: The Canadian economy would be greatly affected by a US withdrawal from NAFTA.
1.1.6.1.4.1. Pro: If NAFTA were to end, then the US and Canada's trade relationship would likely return to being governed by the [FTA](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/if-nafta-falls-the-implications-for-canada) \(Free Trade Area\). This would render Canada unable to challenge distorting US government intervention in markets as for actions to be challenged under an FTA they need to be manifested in the imposition of actual tariffs or other actions that clearly violate a free-trade agreement.
1.1.6.1.4.1.1. Pro: Canadian concerns over market distortion are especially relevant in light of the Trump administration's predisposition to improperly [intervene](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterdetwiler/2018/06/04/stepping-on-adam-smiths-invisible-hand-trumps-unwarranted-intervention-in-power-markets/#554622231adb) in markets.
1.1.6.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Trump's predisposition to intervention shows very little respect for prior agreements or rule of law. There is little reason to believe that NAFTA will prevent him from such behaviour.
1.1.6.1.4.2. Con: Even if this were true, [77%](https://canadians.org/media/poll-if-nafta-results-bad-deal-canadians-and-environment-76-cent-say-walk-away) of Canadians would prefer no NAFTA to a bad deal.
1.1.6.1.4.2.1. Con: The terms used in this poll make it an unreliable indicator of Canadian popular opinion. "A bad deal" is an ambiguous term of which few would approve.
1.1.6.1.4.3. Con: Canada is involved in other free trade agreements, so does not need to [depend](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwyman/2018/01/25/an-end-to-nafta-may-not-be-as-painful-for-canada-as-some-have-feared/#f7b396c3fdd1) on NAFTA long term. It established a free trade agreement between 11 Pacific Rim nations - CPTPP, and is engaged in CETA, a free trade agreement with the E.U.
1.1.6.1.4.3.1. Con: NAFTA has seen Canadian trade with the U.S. increase by more than [300](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/north-american-free-trade-agreement.asp) billion dollars a year. This volume of trade cannot be diverted to other nations without serious disruption.
1.1.6.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Exports to the US comprises [74.49](https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/canadas-staggering-trade-dependency-on-the-u-s-looks-like-a-liability)% of Canada's total.
1.1.6.1.4.4. Pro: It is [estimated](https://www.ft.com/content/b0f343aa-ab3a-3657-8b57-f0086cfaa006) that the stock market will fall by 6%.
1.1.6.1.4.5. Pro: The US withdrawal from NAFTA would cause Canada to lose half a point of growth in [2019](https://www.ft.com/content/b0f343aa-ab3a-3657-8b57-f0086cfaa006).
1.1.6.1.4.6. Con: It is predicted that the Canadian economy would recover from any difficulties by [2022](https://www.ft.com/content/b0f343aa-ab3a-3657-8b57-f0086cfaa006).
1.1.6.2. Pro: Mexico or Canada could conceivably forbid majority foreign ownership of businesses incorporated or established in their countries, harming US investors. [\(Walker, p.10\)](https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TN-Visas.NFAP-Policy-Brief.April-2018.pdf)
1.1.6.3. Pro: Mexican retaliation for withdrawal from NAFTA is made more likely by the country's already [unfavourable](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/01/mexico-election-trump-populist-lopez-obrador-664243?tab=most-read) view of the Trump administration.
1.1.6.4. Con: Mexico and Canada are unlikely to retaliate meaningfully to a withdrawal from NAFTA for the same reason that those countries would be displeased by US withdrawal in the first place: they rely on their trade relationship with the US and would not want to damage it even further.
1.1.7. Pro: US withdrawal from NAFTA would have signalled that the country is not committed to free trade, damaging the country's ability to negotiate future economically beneficial agreements.
1.1.7.1. Pro: US withdrawal from the [Trans-Pacific partnership](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/IN10646.pdf) has already damaged the credibility of the US in international negotiations. NAFTA withdrawal would have exaggerated this effect meaningfully.
1.1.7.2. Con: If the predictions of negative economic consequences of NAFTA withdrawal are borne out, the skepticism of free trade that led to [Trump's election](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voters-skeptical-on-free-trade-drive-sanders-trump-victories-in-michigan/2016/03/09/455e1704-e619-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html) will be proven wrong. This will increase support for beneficial free trade agreements and policy.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: In the wake of Trump's election, the American public's view of free trade have become more [positive](https://news.gallup.com/poll/228317/positive-attitudes-toward-foreign-trade-stay-high.aspx) than ever previously recorded, with 72% seeing it as an opportunity for US growth. There is no need to take such an enormous economic risk in order to manipulate public opinion on free trade given this.
1.1.7.2.2. Pro: Trade policy is highly determined by irrational [loss aversion](https://www.jstor.org/stable/29730141?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). Humans tend to assign a value to loss that is about twice as large as an otherwise similar gain. This explains why the losses caused by NAFTA have had more political consequences than its larger benefits. If existing NAFTA's current benefits are lost, the American public would be more aware of the benefits of free trade.
1.1.7.3. Con: Following through on the threat to leave NAFTA reinforced America's reputation for not [compromising](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-he-wont-compromise-with-canada-in-nafta-deal) under pressure. This may strengthen their bargaining position into the future.
1.1.7.4. Con: This signal had already been sent by the election of an explicitly protectionist President. Future negotiators with the US are well aware of Trump's economic leanings regardless of NAFTA.
1.1.8. Con: If NAFTA withdrawal had produced short term economic harm, it is likely that voters would have blamed Trump and by extension the GOP. Removing Republicans from office would in the long term have resulted in better economic policy and outcomes.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Trump's already [historically low](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-12/trump-is-more-unpopular-than-any-president-with-a-strong-economy) approval rating is primarily buoyed by the strong state of the American economy. If conditions had worsened, his presidency would have quickly become politically untenable.
1.1.8.2. Pro: The Republican economic platform has included massive [deregulation](https://www.vox.com/2017/6/8/15762462/wall-street-house-republicans) of the financial sector. This has increased the risk of the collapse of the banking sector, which would be detrimental for the US economy.
1.1.8.3. Pro: Trump's tax cuts have done [little to help workers](https://www.centralmaine.com/2018/07/24/noah-smith-trumps-tax-cut-hasnt-done-anything-for-workers/) while increasing the [deficit](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/10/17215440/deficits-rising-congressional-budget-office-ceo-debate). If the budget deficit continues to grow at its current pace, the US risks severe [fiscal crisis](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/08/20/donald-trump-trillion-dollar-plus-deficits-fiscal-ruin-column/986236002/).
1.1.8.4. Con: It would have been barbaric to damage the economy, and so harm vulnerable people in the short term, for a long term political agenda.
1.1.8.5. Con: Democratic electoral chances in the 2018 and 2020 elections are good enough that there was no need for America to take such a risk.
1.1.8.5.1. Pro: Democrats are [favorites](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/?ex_cid=rrpromo) to retake the house in the 2018 midterms. This would majorly undermine Trump's capacity to pass his economic platform.
1.1.8.5.2. Pro: [Betting markets](https://www.predictit.org/Market/3698/Who-will-win-the-2020-US-presidential-election) indicate that it is more likely than not that a Democratic candidate will beat Trump in the 2020 Presidential election.
1.1.8.5.3. Con: Betting [markets](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/markets-predict-hillary-clinton-will-beat-donald-trump/), [pundits](http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/pundits-got-it-wrong-trump-3076871-Nov2016/) and political [polls](http://uk.businessinsider.com/polls-wrong-trump-clinton-why-2016-11?r=US&IR=T) all favoured Democrats in the 2016 presidential race. They cannot be depended upon.
1.1.8.5.4. Con: Republicans are on course to retain the [Senate](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate/) in 2018, giving them two more years as the most powerful party even if the Democrats sweep the 2020 election.
1.2. Pro: NAFTA reduced the number of jobs available for American workers.
1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.
1.2.2. Con: NAFTA has led to increased competitiveness of American corporations, which makes them more likely to be successful globally, increasing employment \([Hufbauer, 7](https://piie.com/sites/default/files/publications/pb/pb14-13.pdf)\).
1.2.2.1. Pro: This has been further benefited by NAFTA acting as a [protectionist policy](https://qz.com/914363/nafta-created-thousands-of-good-american-jobs-just-not-for-trumps-rust-belt-supporters/), protecting jobs which would have been lost via trade with Germany, Japan, South Korea and the rest of the world.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: NAFTA was designed in [response](https://www.thebalance.com/facts-about-nafta-statistics-and-accomplishments-3306280) to the Rome treaty and developments in the formation of the European Union. North America needed an area of free trade to make themselves competitive.
1.2.2.2. Con: It has [allowed](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/lori-wallach/nafta-at-20-one-million-u_b_4550207.html) U.S companies to grow more efficient by firing U.S. employees and relocating business to Mexico. In many instances this is not a positive development for the U.S.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.5.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.4.
1.2.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.
1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.2.
1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.3. Pro: NAFTA has increased the US' trade deficit, harming American prosperity and sustainability.
1.3.1. Pro: Trade deficits are indicators of economies that are [unable to compete](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/312561-peter-navarro-is-right-the-trade-deficit-is-a-disaster-for) in an increasing number of industries.
1.3.2. Pro: The US' trade deficit in goods with Canada and Mexico is larger than it was before NAFTA was implemented \([Payne, 13](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BPC-North-American-Free-Trade-Agreement-Overview.pdf)\).
1.3.3. Con: Withdrawing from NAFTA would increase the the trade deficit.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Under WTO rules, countries can only apply tariffs to states that do not share a free trade agreement with it [equally](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbrinkley/2017/11/02/nafta-withdrawal-would-increase-not-lower-u-s-trade-deficit-with-mexico/#42d485923d99). The US' average tariffs are currently 2.8%, whilst Mexico's are 4.5%. This would mean that the price of American exports to Mexico would increase more than that of Mexican imports to the US.
1.3.3.2. Pro: NAFTA has significantly [reduced](https://jackwelch.strayer.edu/winning/border-wall-nafta/) U.S. trade debt to Mexico and Canada.
1.3.4. Con: Trade deficits are not an important consideration in terms of the American economy's health.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Economists are currently in [conflict](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-numbers-game-trade-1.4579792) about the accuracy of trade deficit figures due to measurement issues caused by re-exportation.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Trade deficits can be caused by a number of factors, not all of them negative.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: A [growing US economy](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-trade-deficit-how-much-does-it-matter) can cause a trade deficit as US citizens have more money to buy more goods from abroad.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: It remains a negative outcome for the U.S. that its citizens import more goods rather than buy U.S. goods with their increased wealth. Doing so sees the profits created leave the country.
1.3.4.2.1.1.1. Con: Lots of goods that people buy from abroad are not produced in the US.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Trade deficits can be a [result](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/upshot/want-to-rev-up-the-economy-dont-worry-about-the-trade-deficit.html?smid=pl-share&_r=1) of positive economic phenomena such as high demand for American currency.
1.3.4.2.3. Pro: Trade deficits often result from consumers buying imports of better quality or lower cost. Trade deficits indicate that these consumers are having their desires better satisfied as a result of these imports.
1.3.4.3. Pro: A large part of the trade deficit is due to the importing of goods and services by companies. These companies use those imports to run their businesses, employing citizens and paying taxes which boosts the economy.
1.3.4.4. Con: Even if economically beneficial, the trade deficits hurt a [specific segment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/05/12/getting-straight-about-the-costs-of-trade/?utm_term=.d095bb41face) of workers who are poorer and therefore deserve consideration above and beyond their GDP contribution.
1.3.5. Con: Only [10%](http://uk.businessinsider.com/canada-mexico-nafta-and-us-trade-deficit-in-charts-2017-10?r=US&IR=T) of America's trade deficit relates to NAFTA trade.
1.3.6. Pro: Running a trade deficit increases the amount of [foreign debt](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/guide/article/54/) taken on by America. If the deficit outstrips growth it will be unable to fund repayments.
1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.5. Con: Withdrawing from NAFTA would have hurt US relations with Mexico and Canada.
1.5.1. Con: [Canadian](https://globalnews.ca/news/4297411/canada-us-trade-war-animated-maps/) and [Mexican](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/trade-profile-mexico-focuses-united-states) dependence on the US economy is far greater than American dependence on their economies: they will not react negatively to such a move as part of an effort to quickly secure a new trade deal.
1.5.1.1. Con: Even if Canada and Mexico are not themselves well-placed to respond to Trump's actions, the diplomatic rift caused by a US withdrawal from NAFTA would create an opportunity for them to enter the sphere of influence of America's rivals.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: China is [explicitly](https://qz.com/855355/china-and-mexico-are-strengthening-commercial-and-diplomatic-ties-in-response-to-donald-trumps-protectionism/) attempting to leverage the opportunity of Trump's presidency to increase its influence over Mexico.
1.5.1.1.2. Pro: Both Mexico and Canada have entered the [Trans Pacific Partnership](https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/08/news/economy/tpp-trump-tariffs/index.html) deal, which the US has backed out of. It is likely that the EU would continue to form closer connections with them in the absence of the US.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Luis de la Calle, a former Mexican trade negotiator, has [stated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/world/americas/mexico-nafta.html) that although tariffs would not be welcome, it would not prevent the integration of their economies.
1.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.4.3.1.1.
1.5.2. Pro: Canada has already reacted badly to US levies on imports by filing a complaint against American duties at the [World Trade Organisation](https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/newsalert-canada-launches-global-trade-complaint-vs-u-s-over-use-of-duties). NAFTA goes far beyond this, and would spark a far more severe reaction.
1.5.3. Pro: Co-operation with Mexico and Canada is crucial for the security of the US, which will be harmed by withdrawing from NAFTA.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Mexico has threatened to reduce cooperation on [security issues](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-11/bad-nafta-outcome-could-hit-cooperation-on-security-mexico-says) if the US withdraws from NAFTA.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: US-Mexico security cooperation is [important](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/us-mexican-security-cooperation-is-at-a-historic-high-will-that-change-under-trump/2017/03/17/dee0e92f-8ae5-4b26-a5e0-fa32e7cf71ce_story.html) for the control of the movement of drug cartels into the US.
1.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Mexico is responsible for [40%](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/opinion/nafta-national-security-mexico.html) of the apprehensions of those bound for the US.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: López Obrador has made it clear that he will not allow Mexican migration policy to merely be an [extension](http://eng.majalla.com/2018/07/article55256962/what-if-mexico-stops-cooperating-on-migration) of the U.S.'s. In this context, threatening Mexican interests by withdrawing from NAFTA may well lead to a reduction in cooperation.
1.5.3.2. Pro: NAFTA is crucial to the security of the American energy industry, as Canada and Mexico are [important partners](https://www.forbes.com/sites/themexicoinstitute/2018/05/09/assuring-energy-security-with-a-modern-nafta/#5fa5e7ef3019), facilitated by NAFTA.
1.6. Con: Withdrawal from NAFTA would have meant that the US could not have negotiated the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement \(USMCA\). The USMCA is good for the US.
1.6.1. Pro: The USMCA is important for maintaining the US' regional leadership position.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The ["China Clause"](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-china-clause-in-usmca-is-american-posturing-but-its-no-veto/) contained in USMCA gives the US more influence over the trade agreements entered into by Mexico and Canada. In light of expanding Chinese power, this is a valuable tool for the US.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Trudeau has signalled he is open to [increasing](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-china-trudeau-1.4864177) trade with China in the aftermath of the USMCA.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Withdrawing from NAFTA would have increased China's comparative economic strength in the region, a strategic outcome which is not in the interests of the US \([Spearot, 54](https://usmex.ucsd.edu/_files/NAFTA-essays/nafta-essays.pdf)\).
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.1.1.
1.6.2. Pro: By requiring that automakers use [75%](https://www.industryweek.com/economy/how-will-shift-nafta-usmca-affect-auto-industry) \(up from 65%\) North American-made parts in their cars to be imported duty free, automakers have an incentive to increase the proportion of North American parts used in the production of cars and light trucks.
1.6.2.1. Con: This provision is likely to [increase](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/sport/football/new-usmca-trade-deal-with-canada-and-mexico-could-raise-car-prices/vp-BBNOxCX) the domestic purchase price of American cars, harming US consumers.
1.6.3. Pro: The USMCA is increasing the [access](http://uk.businessinsider.com/us-canada-mexico-trade-deal-usmca-nafta-details-dairy-auto-dispute-resolution-2018-10?r=US&IR=T) of American dairy producers to Canadian markets.
1.6.4. Pro: Stock markets [shot up](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/01/investing/stock-market-today-usmca-ge-tesla-dow/index.html) after the announcement of USMCA, signalling that it is perceived to be economically beneficial.
1.6.4.1. Con: This was the result of the end of a period of uncertainty about the future of NAFTA, not because the markets judged USMCA to be superior to NAFTA.
1.6.5. Pro: The USMCA is increasing the [guaranteed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/01/winners-losers-usmca-trade-deal/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d4acf9af0276) wages of American auto manufacturers, improving their livelihoods and producing further economic benefits as they spend their increased earnings.
1.6.6. Con: The USMCA has involved the loss of NAFTA's investor dispute settlement [mechanism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/01/winners-losers-usmca-trade-deal/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d4acf9af0276), which allowed American firms to sue Canada and Mexico for anticompetitive practices.
1.6.6.1. Con: The investor dispute settlement mechanism gives corporations the ability for corporations to [bypass](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-urges-us-trade-rep-to-remove-isds-provisions-during-next-round-of-nafta-negotiations) the rules and courts of the countries in which they operate, including America itself. Every country in NAFTA was damaged by this attack on sovereignty.
1.6.6.1.1. Con: Corporations were successful in only [one-third](http://accf.org/2018/07/10/why-the-investor-state-dispute-settlement-is-critical-to-nafta/) of the cases they brought and the U.S. government has yet to lose a case that was brought against it. At least for the US, this threat to sovereignty, has never materialised.
1.6.6.2. Pro: The investor dispute settlement mechanism protected American [investors](http://accf.org/2018/07/10/why-the-investor-state-dispute-settlement-is-critical-to-nafta/) by ensuring they would not be arbitrarily hard done by as a result of the rules of Canada and Mexico. This decreased the risk of investing in those countries and thereby encourages the most efficient allocation of American capital across the three countries.
1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.6.2.1.
1.6.8. Con: Leaving NAFTA would have put the US in a better negotiating position.
1.6.8.1. Pro: Withdrawing from NAFTA starts a [6 month termination](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta-canada-trump/trump-could-use-nafta-withdrawal-letter-as-negotiating-leverage-idUSKBN1F000B) process at the end of which the US could elect to stay in NAFTA. This would have put immense pressure on Mexico and Canada to concede to many of the US' demands to preserve the deal.
1.6.8.1.1. Con: Regardless of the amount of political will involved, it is extremely difficult to negotiate complex agreements in short windows of time. This could lead to the US leaving in too much haste and agreeing to unsatisfactory terms in the process.
1.6.8.2. Con: If the US did not truly intend to leave then this tactic would have forced them to accept whatever deal is offered, and stay. This perceived desperation may have undermined their position.
1.7. Pro: NAFTA has led to an increase in immigrants in the US, hurting the American economy.
1.7.1. Con: NAFTA may not have stemmed the flow of immigrants initially, but pulling out now would increase the number of Mexican workers entering the US.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Emigration to the US was [fueled](https://www.newsweek.com/nafta-and-immigration-trump-threatens-agreement-what-know-593325) by a lack of development in Mexico. Damaging the economy now is likely to hugely increase the number of people emigrating.
1.7.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.1.3.1.1.
1.7.1.2. Con: NAFTA increased migration because it allowed U.S. farmers to [flood](https://www.marketplace.org/2017/03/20/economy/how-nafta-changed-corn-market-and-accidentally-spurred-more-immigration) the Mexican market. So long as this continues, NAFTA will amplify the numbers of illegal migrants into the U.S.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.1.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.2.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.
1.8. Con: Withdrawing from NAFTA would disrupt the supply chains of countless businesses, threatening their sustainability.
1.8.1. Con: NAFTA has increased the US's trade deficit. This means that it facilitates the influx of goods that compete with US production more than it facilitates the production of US goods. Thus, disturbing some supply chains is worthwhile to rectify the situation.
1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.8.2. Pro: The reintroduction of stringent border checks for goods would create major issues for companies that depend on inter-NAFTA supply chains.
1.8.2.1. Pro: This is particularly a problem in the agriculture-food industry, given stringent regulation: NAFTA has led to [faster border processing](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2017/09/05/softening-a-hard-border-lessons-from-north-america-for-post-brexit-ireland/) based around shared safety standards.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: It is easy to justify extra checks on agriculture-food products owing to public health, food safety, regulations etc. This means it can act as a [de facto barrier](https://www.producer.com/2017/11/if-nafta-ends-is-canadas-food-sector-prepared/) to trade.
1.8.2.1.1.1. Con: If extra checks are harmful to the agricultural sector, experts and lobby groups within this industry could advise the government to not implement them or lobby against them.
1.8.3. Pro: The reintroduction of higher tariffs will increase costs for companies with inter-NAFTA supply chains.
1.8.3.1. Con: This would prevent existing businesses from undercutting businesses that operate exclusively within the US. These firms are better for the US economy.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.5.1.
1.8.3.1.2. Pro: Due to lower costs of living and lower labour protections in Mexico, companies have either moved jobs or depressed wages in order to maintain low-skilled jobs in America.
1.8.3.1.2.1. Pro: In [2013](https://www.ft.com/content/4ae4b3be-70d8-3d2f-8dd5-a5644a2c2f1f), Mexican wages were on par with China's. It was impossible for many US companies to compete at that level.
1.8.3.1.2.2. Pro: Corporations have used NAFTA as an argument to reduce wages or cancel healthcare plans as an alternative to moving jobs.
1.8.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: One out of every ten employers [told](http://prospect.org/article/nafta-cross-border-disaster) their workers that they would move to Mexico if they voted in a union during a union drive.
1.8.3.1.2.3. Con: The solution to this problem is not to withdraw from NAFTA, given that this would harm the labour market overall, but rather to enshrine better labour protections for Mexican workers increasing American competitiveness \([Shaiken, 51](https://usmex.ucsd.edu/_files/NAFTA-essays/nafta-essays.pdf)\).
1.8.3.2. Pro: Many US companies, particularly those in the manufacturing and automobile sector rely on importing parts from Mexico and Canada tariff free. Without NAFTA this process would be significantly more expensive, potentially making these firms move to countries with cheaper production costs.
1.8.3.2.1. Pro: Canada and Mexico are ranked [first and third](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/business/economy/what-would-happen-if-the-us-withdrew-from-nafta.html) respectively as countries whose imports contribute the most to each U.S. export in terms of raw materials.
1.8.3.2.2. Pro: It is [estimated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/business/economy/what-would-happen-if-the-us-withdrew-from-nafta.html) that without NAFTA the average tariff charged by Mexico and Canada would be 7.1% and 4.2% respectively.
1.9. Pro: NAFTA has had a negative effect on wage growth in America.
1.9.1. Con: This forgets that competition from the European Union, Japan and South Korea may well have lead to more wage depression, and more jobs being exported.
1.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.9.1.2. Con: This is mere speculation, and particularly unlikely.
1.9.1.2.1. Pro: The geographic distance between the US and these alternatives mean that migration of labour to the US would have been far less likely.
1.9.1.2.2. Pro: Lower wages in Mexico provided a pull factor for US companies. Comparably higher wages in the EU, Japan and South Korea make it unlikely that it would have happened to the same extent.
1.9.2. Pro: Companies [used](https://www.thebalance.com/disadvantages-of-nafta-3306273) the threat of moving to Mexico to prevent unions from negotiating for higher wages.
1.9.2.1. Con: American companies can always use the threat of moving to [cheaper jurisdictions](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/trump-carrier-offshoring-jobs_us_5a1f6f97e4b0a8581e67e62e) to undermine unions regardless of NAFTA.
1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.1.2.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.2.2.3.1.1.1.
