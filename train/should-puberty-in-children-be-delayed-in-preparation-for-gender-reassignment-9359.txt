Discussion Title: Should puberty in children be delayed in preparation for gender reassignment?

1. Puberty should not be delayed in preparation for gender reassignment.
1.1. Con: A child has a right to choose what gender they present as. If anything, all children's puberty should be delayed until they are capable of making an informed decision as an adult.
1.1.1. Con: Implementing a social policy that forces the medical delay of puberty of all individuals would be a significant act of violence by the state against a vast majority of the population.
1.1.1.1. Con: It is questionable how such an action would constitute a form of state violence. There must be some actual damage done, or some right violated.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: The burden of proof is on the person making the claim that a whole population would benefit from a medical intervention. All unnecessary medical intervention for children is an act of violence.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Habeas corpus. That is how we prove things. Not the first one to speak is right, and the second one to speak has to prove the other one wrong. There is no body to show that medical intervention for children is an act of violence.
1.1.2. Con: Delaying puberty delays adulthood. Delaying puberty delays neural development and results in a person being unable to make decisions with an adult brain.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Behavioral and neuroimaging studies have shown that pubertal hormones likely [influence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3410522/) the structure and function of the adolescent brain. Missing out on this developmental opportunity could be harmful.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: More recent research [further supports](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217307005) this: "pubertal hormones may trigger the opening of an adolescent critical period for experience-dependent rewiring of circuits underlying executive function".
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Hormonal [events](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4539143/) "play an important role in functional and structural brain development during adolescence".
1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.4. Con: Universally delaying puberty while an [overwhelming](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/13/5-key-findings-about-lgbt-americans/) [majority](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/09h684X2) of individuals gender aligns with their biological sex is unconstitutional. Using a marginal case to justify a universal mandate violates privacy protections afforded by the [constitution](http://www.rbs2.com/rrmt.pdf).
1.1.4.1. Con: The only privacy case that deals with medical procedures is [Roe v. Wade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade), which affirmed the right of women to opt in to pregnancies, so, at best, it would seem to be that this would argue that anyone would be able to opt in to the puberty of their choice at will, and not that it could be mandated to change the default to opt out.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: The default is a natural biological process, not an opt in medical treatment. Individuals do not opt in to teething, growing, or any other natural process.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Interfering with natural processes has become the default in much of the world. A majority of people, for example, interfere with fertility cycles by default. There is no reason default biological process should not change through medical interference.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: All of the individuals in you claim consented to the change, unlike a change by mandate.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Babies did not consent to have life saving procedures done to keep them alive, and very few children consent to get a shot of any kind.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Many adolescents [interfere](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1451380) with growing, so they arguably "opt in" to more growth.
1.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: There are no issues with consent in the cases you cited.
1.1.4.1.1.3. Con: There is no reason why the natural process should be preferred.
1.1.4.2. Con: Many [states](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277) have laws on the books making vaccines mandatory for all those able to receive them not for their own protection, but for the protection of the minority of people unable to get them.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: This law doesn't mandate vaccinations. It makes vaccinations a requirement prior to entry to school/daycare etc. Unless homeschooled \(which arguably only affects a minority\), schooling is mandatory. Therefore, vaccinations are pretty much mandatory by extension.
1.1.4.3. Con: If it was immoral, unconstitutional, or illogical to make everyone carry the burden of even a small subset of people, building would not be [required](http://accessadvocates.com/public-places-must-grant-wheel-chair-access-and-provide-safe-wheel-chair-ramps/) to spend substantial amounts of federally funded money making their places handicapped accessible.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: Accessibility to a building doesn't violate bodily autonomy.
1.1.4.4. Con: [This](http://www.rbs2.com/rrmt.pdf) essay discusses the history of judicial opinions that hold a mentally competent adult patient has the legal right in the USA to refuse continuing medical treatment for any reason, even if that refusal will hasten their death. A child is not an adult.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Children aren't legally competent to make certain decisions.
1.1.5. Pro: Many people grow up believing their gender is fixed, and are not given an opportunity to select their gender.
1.1.6. Con: If a person has to be a consenting adult to make the decision to transition, a person should have to be a consenting adult before that choice is made for them as well.
1.1.7. Con: Children are by default extremely vulnerable to the expectation of adults, and peers. The glorification of traditional gender roles and the social media celebration of individuals who exemplify them is a powerful influence for children who are hungry for external validation. This creates an incentive for children to draw dangerously hasty conclusions about identity.
1.1.8. Pro: Many people are pressured not to voice their dysphoria due to potentially violent consequences, sometimes from their parents.
1.1.9. Con: Children do not have a right to choose what gender they are, they are not adults and not capable of making decisions as impactful as surgery, hormone replacement or delay of puberty.
1.1.10. Pro: Many people take a while to realize they have gender dysphoria.
1.1.10.1. Con: The time/development required for an individual to come to the realization that they have gender dysphoria may need to play out into adulthood and past puberty.
1.1.10.1.1. Con: We can only give a person so much time to make this decision, in part because of the development of medical problems.
1.1.10.1.2. Pro: We have a duty to give them as much time as we can to make an informed decision.
1.1.11. Con: Puberty in its timing is natural and different for everyone. Children do not have any rights on legal paper, so they should not have the right to make such a life altering decision before their brains have fully developed. Their minds do not have the capacity to understand the impact of things or situations like adult minds.
1.1.12. Pro: Not going through gendered puberty doesn't really hurt a person. Going through the wrong puberty hurts them a lot.
1.1.12.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.13. Pro: More people then just those suffering from gender dysphoria, or who will suffer from it, might want to delay, or abstain from puberty, and not have a clear method, or opportunity to do so. It could be that this is another instance of the [curb-cut effect.](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_curb_cut_effect)
1.1.13.1. Pro: Some people don't really care what their gender is, and some of those people might just not want to go through the bother of puberty.
1.1.13.2. Pro: Some people may choose the distraction a sexually active mind presents is not worth the benefits.
1.1.13.3. Pro: Some people would rather get to a stable place in their life through this awkward time of finding one's self, and would appreciate puberty not throwing a wrench in everything.
1.1.14. Con: Puberty is [more](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3761219/) than just physical changes: hormonal and neuropsychological changes happen as well, which shape sexual interactions, and later, reproduction. Inhibiting this would delay more than just physical adulthood.
1.1.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.14.2. Con: There are multiple sources that all show that there are no negative permanent effects of delaying puberty.
1.1.14.2.1. Pro: A [bioethicist](http://www.theintell.com/news/local/looking-at-suppressing-puberty-for-transgender-kids/article_9082cab8-c47c-11e5-8186-afa80da85677.html) acknowledges that puberty blocking is reversible, and puberty will resume once treatment is stopped.
1.1.14.2.2. Pro: A [clinical review](http://impactprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Kuper-2014-Puberty-Blockers-Clinical-Research-Review.pdf) of puberty-blocking medication found that blocking puberty is fully reversible.
1.1.14.2.2.1. Con: This citation does not support the original claim. Admitted in this paper is the fact that in the Netherlands study 70 children had continued anxiety, anger and other psychosocial problems after starting GnRHa's.
1.1.14.2.3. Pro: A doctor treating trans kids at Boston's Children Hospital confirms the results of puberty blocking are [reversible](https://thriving.childrenshospital.org/norman-spack-saving-transgender-lives/).
1.1.14.2.4. Pro: A pediatric endocrinology group [states](https://www.healio.com/endocrinology/pediatric-endocrinology/news/print/endocrine-today/%7B69c4c36a-37c3-4053-a856-22a27f8df62c%7D/pubertal-blockade-safe-for-pediatric-patients-with-gender-identity-disorder) that "pubertal blockade" is safe for patients with gender dysphoria disorder.
1.1.14.2.5. Pro: [This study](http://www.eje-online.org/content/155/suppl_1/S131.full) says suppressing/delaying puberty in adolescents with gender dysphoria is fully reversible.
1.1.14.2.5.1. Con: This same [study](http://www.eje-online.org/content/155/suppl_1/S131.full) admits that any long term use of puberty blockers may affect bone density. This study cannot be generalized because they used few subjects.
1.1.14.2.6. Con: [A study](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/growing-pains) discussing over 50 peer-reviewed articles on gender dysphoria in children shows little evidence of puberty blockers being either useful or reversible.
1.1.14.3. Con: When prescribed, hormone blockers are often given until someone is 16, which is the age of consent, people below this age are not able to give consent, and therefore should not be engaging in sexual intercourse anyway.
1.1.14.3.1. Con: If an individual cannot consent to having intercourse, then they don't have the mental capacity to consent to complex medical treatments either. This also presents legal issues with [informed consent.](https://www.hg.org/informed-consent-law.html)
1.1.14.3.1.1. Con: All the more reason to delay irrevocable changes that occur in puberty such as vocal pitch changes, breast development, bone structure changes and facial hair which all cause enormous burdens on the transitioner later in life and contribute heavily to gender dysphoria and suicide rates amongst trans persons.
1.1.15. Con: Violating bodily autonomy by a mandate without consent or cause is immoral, especially given the [relevant](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/09h684X2) [proportions](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/13/5-key-findings-about-lgbt-americans/) of those affected to those treated.
1.1.15.1. Con: Since the only method we have of telling if someone is transgender is self report, it is quite possible that the number is under-reported.
1.1.15.1.1. Pro: Some people might feel only slight gender dysphoria, and not feel the need to report it, but would still benefit from proper measures being taken.
1.1.15.1.2. Pro: Some people might think that in their current situation no form of currently developed treatment would help, and prefer to remain silent for that reason.
1.1.15.1.3. Pro: Some people may not report due to extreme social stigma.
1.1.15.1.4. Con: Even if this were underreported, the percentage of adolescents identifying as trans would be small.
1.1.15.1.4.1. Pro: Less than [2% of high school students](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/science/transgender-children.html) identify as trans.
1.1.15.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.1.15.3. Pro: Individuals can still seek appropriate treatment without violating others bodily autonomy.
1.1.15.3.1. Con: Individuals can't treat a disease, such as gender dysphoria, until they know it is there, and since the consequences of failure to detect are so severe, we owe it to them to give them as much time as we can to self-diagnose.
1.1.15.3.1.1. Pro: The only current method available of screening for discrepancies between sex and gender is self-report.
1.1.15.3.1.2. Pro: The self in question is a child just developing the capabilities to make long term decisions.
1.1.16. Pro: -> See 1.1.15.3.1.
1.2. Pro: All children and adolescents go through a process of identity development that includes confusion and experimentation. Delaying puberty may extend this period of confusion by keeping an individual in a state of developmental childhood.
1.2.1. Con: Neither confusion, nor experimentation are necessarily bad things, in fact, as a general rule, they are both extremely beneficial to one's development, and generally create a sense of depth, and growth.
1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.3. Pro: Gender identity development includes social, and biological factors that change with maturation. Stopping development violates an undetermined process.
1.3.1. Con: There is nothing inherently valuable about nature, or undermined processes, and pretending there is causes suffering, and puts people in danger of death or disability.
1.3.1.1. Con: All analogies that compare development through puberty with outside invasions of the body by bacteria and viruses are faulty. Puberty is not a disease caused by an invading organism.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: To say that one treatment is not comparable to another because it is not literally the same thing is to invalidate the very idea of a simile, and to arbitrary shut down all conversation.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Arguments based on analogies are vulnerable to criticism that they are faulty analogies. The claim of faulty analogy must be supported with a reason but making this type of criticism does not 'shut down all conversation'. If a criticism that an analogy is faulty is weak then it can be countered and the debate continues.
1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The parent claim is false because of non-disprovable flying spaghetti monsters. The fact that they disprove the parent claim is also non-disprovable.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: Arguments based on analogies are vulnerable to criticism that they are faulty analogies. The claim of faulty analogy must be supported with a reason.
1.3.1.2. Con: All analogies that compare puberty to accidental injury are faulty because puberty is not an injury.
1.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.3.1.3. Con: All analogies comparing health promoting practices that prevent disease, such as consuming vitamins, essential nutrients or healthy food, and the ‘prevention’ of puberty are faulty because puberty is not a disease that can be prevented by vitamins or nutrition.
1.3.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.3.1.4. Pro: Eating good food effects how our body develops, and therefore 'violates an undetermined process'.
1.3.1.4.1. Con: Eating good food to make us healthy, or eating food at all to keep us alive, is an essential need required to live. Hormone blocking is a recent medical invention that delays the development of an individual. The absence of hormone blockers does not result in death. The absence of food does. They are not analogous.
1.3.1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.3.1.4.1.2. Con: If a person is going to die, or grow up malnourished, or have a broken bone, that's just nature's plan for that person. To reach in, and intervene with someone's diet is just as much an affront to the natural order as literally anything else a person might do.
1.3.1.5. Pro: Cancer is a naturally occurring part of life not caused by a lack of nutrition, or an outside invader, yet for some strange reason, we feel compelled to fight it by putting very unnatural things in people's bodies. All the unexplained, and misplaced objections the cons have have no relevance to cancer.
1.3.1.5.1. Con: Cancer, along with many other illnesses, will impair, and ultimately, kill the individual in question. Puberty does not inherently maim a person, nor does one die from going through it.
1.3.1.5.1.1. Con: The wrong puberty does maim a person. To many a man, breasts are not but tumors protruding from their chest, to many a women, facial hair might as well be third degree burns, permanently, and painfully disfiguring them, and people have died from gender dysphoria.
1.3.1.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.3.1.5.2. Con: Cancer is a disease of deregulation of normal cellular processes. It is "naturally occurring" in so far as any disease is "naturally occurring". Cancer is still a disease and is not a normal physiologically intended process.
1.3.1.6. Pro: Setting a broken bone while it is still growing 'violates an undermined process'.
1.3.1.6.1. Con: A broken bone is a painful physical injury that results in a loss of mechanical function if left untreated. A mismatch between identity and physiology is a socio-biological disorder that people attempt to treat by changing the body or changing the mind.
1.3.1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.3.1.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.4.1.2.
1.3.1.7. Con: Allowing child development to unfold as uninterupted as possible is an essential value. If we accept that nothing about nature is valuable this creates a notion that anything can be done to a child because natural development does not put any restrictions on our actions.
1.3.1.7.1. Con: If allowing child development to unfold as uninterrupted as possible is an essential value, then there must be a reason why it is valuable. Proof by declaration is fallacious.
1.3.1.7.2. Con: Restricting children's ability to make this decision for themselves is just a slippery slope from taking all people's freedoms at all times.
1.3.1.7.2.1. Pro: It's always some combination of safer, more convenient, or less worrisome to give people freedom, the safest someone could be, for themselves, and others, is in a prison cell for life with no agency. Especially if you are willing to do that based on some purely theoretical dangerous event in the future. When you do this, it is trivial to justify striping everyone of their rights.
1.3.1.8. Pro: Keeping a child from dying 'violates an undermined process'.
1.3.1.9. Pro: Putting florid in the water to prevent teeth from rotting out of a person's skull 'violates a natural process'.
1.3.1.10. Pro: Putting iodine in salt to keep us all from walking around like frogs, and dying do to deficient immune systems 'violates a natural process'.
1.3.1.11. Pro: Using antibiotics to kill a harmful bacteria 'violates a natural process'.
1.3.1.11.1. Con: This is a faulty analogy because puberty has nothing in common with the invasion of the body by a harmful bacteria.
1.3.1.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.1.11.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.3.1.12. Pro: Making artificially weakened strings of viruses, then using them to prevent people from getting some of the most horrifying diseases imaginable 'violates a natural process'.
1.3.1.12.1. Con: This is a faulty analogy. A virus is a foreign invader that threatens the health of a higher order organism. The suffering of the virus from antiviral medication is justified by the reduction in suffering of the person receiving the medication. Puberty and the development secondary sex characteristics is not a foreign invader from outside the body.
1.3.1.12.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.1.
1.3.1.12.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.
1.3.1.13. Con: It is important to differentiate between medical intervention that protects the integrity of the body \(prevention or remediation of disease\) and intervention that alters otherwise intact bodies.
1.3.1.13.1. Pro: For example, while requesting plastic surgery can be an important step towards healing, such as after accident injuries, it can also be an expression of [body image disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder).
1.3.1.13.1.1. Con: Gender dysphoria would fall plainly in the first category.
1.3.2. Pro: In medicine, one of the main guiding principle says not to harm patients. This restricts the application of unnecessary medical intervention, because those interventions always carry some risk. Impeding development carries a risk.
1.3.2.1. Con: That is not what "do no harm" means, "do no harm" means don't intentionally do something that you know will harm your patient for a cause that you know will not be of benefit to them. Basically don't torture your patients, and don't run harmful experiments on them.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Objective standards of health and harm are necessary to enact health policies that can be fairly implemented.
1.3.2.2.1. Con: According to this argument, there is a 'right' form a human should take, and anyone who deviates from it should be forced to conform to this model. It allows for no agency, and encourages very dangerous, and harmful procedures.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: Any ideal model would be arbitrary and likely exclude many identities.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: The male sex varies from the female sex in form and function in a consistent manner at a predictable rate. The male sex and female sex are thus distinct enough to say that there is a health ideal for one and another health ideal for the other, as relates to the reliable ways in which they vary in form and function.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Con: Similar to the past belief in different human "races", differences between genders are largely cosmetic and based on aesthetics. We can assume that in time this will be seen as we view theories of "races" today.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Con: That is all the more reason to treat gender dysphoria as a serious issue, not something to whitewash out of existence, it means the mismatch in parts is a serious medical condition. Treating a boy like a girl, or vice versa is a potentially fatal mistake.
1.3.2.2.4. Pro: There is no "right" form that a male or female should take, only the form that males and females tend to reliably take as a consequence of the evolution of our species. To assert a health ideal is not to make a value judgement about whether the form should or shouldn't be a certain way, but to say that given that it is a certain way, that which enables a full range of biological function is preferable to that which reduces or destroys functions and capacities initially possessed.
1.3.2.2.4.1. Con: Everything has an effect on one's potential abilities, from one's height, to the thickness of their hair, and beyond that, everything being uniform has functionality in interactions with others, especially in the delicate field of medicine, so according to the logic of "Objective standards" it always makes sense to eliminate these deviations, as it will always increase one's abilities, as asserted by the standard, the one and only allowed measure of health according to the theory.
1.3.2.2.5. Pro: An objective standard of health can sensibly be construed from what is typical in a human being’s biological function. Where something deviates from what is typical in human biology, it may be  harmful under such a standard if it interferes with, damages, or destroys a biological function, thereby reducing a human’s range of physiological agency and capacity in comparison to the median.
1.3.3. Con: We make a number of interventions in our daily lives that violate "natural processes" with the aim of improving our health. These range from adding iodine to salt, through treating a broken bone, to having mandatory vaccination programmes.
1.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.13.
1.3.4. Pro: it is a natural order of things, people should stop trying to change themselves and instead accept themselves for who they really are, and the way mother nature made them out to be
1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.14.2.
1.5. Con: Delaying the decision through puberty blocking allows the individual the final say over what happens to their own body. Letting the majority vote on this is a gross human rights violation as the outside cisgender world will not face the consequences of these decisions, trans bodies will.
1.5.1. Pro: Forcing children to go through a puberty they feel is wrong for them against their wishes is unethical.
1.6. Con: People who realize they are transgender should not be compelled to wait, but should be allowed to undergo the puberty they have realized is right for them.
1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.14.
1.6.2. Con: You can't choose a 'right' puberty if you've never experienced any puberty to begin with.
1.6.2.1. Con: Choosing the "right" puberty does not depend on experience, but on being able to access the puberty that aligns with one's gender identity.
1.6.3. Pro: Violating bodily autonomy by a mandate without consent or cause is immoral, especially given that the child has made their decision.
1.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.14.3.1.
1.7. Pro: The entire transgender movement's ideology is logically flawed and based on sexist beliefs [\(discussion\)](https://www.kialo.com/transgenderism-doesnt-exist-18381). A boy who likes pink and plays with dolls and prams, is still a boy. A girl who likes blue and plays with guns, is still a girl. Children should be encouraged to be themselves, not told they're in the wrong body.
1.8. Pro: We don't have any long-term longitudinal studies about the effects of a massive hormone storm on a prepubescent body, and it's unethical to expose children to risk, and make them unwitting subjects in a real-world, uncontrolled experiment.
1.9. Con: Delaying the onset of puberty allows the individual to more successfully transition, through subsequent hormone replacement.[pediatrics.aappublications.org](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.full.pdf)
1.10. Pro: A majority of children who experience gender dysphoria experience an alignment between their gender and biological sex after puberty.
1.10.1. Pro: The DSM-5 [\(p. 455\)](https://archive.org/stream/DSM-5#page/n489/mode/2up) identifies persistence rates of Gender Dysphoria \(the percentage of individuals who still experience Gender Dysphoria after puberty\) from childhood into adolescence and adulthood as being between 2.2% to 30% for natal males and 12% to 50% for natal females.
1.10.1.1. Con: All studies giving us this information use a very small sample size.
1.10.1.1.1. Con: Until more data becomes available, this data using small samples is the most accurate set we can work with and therefore shouldn't be immediately discredited.
1.10.1.2. Con: When the best data you have has a 38% spread, it's likely you don't have any data.
1.10.1.3. Pro: Where the data is inconclusive, it is better to err on the side of caution rather than liberality, given the potential irreversibility of some symptoms of delaying puberty [thenewatlantis.com](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/growing-pains) \(footnotes 102-122\)
1.10.1.3.1. Con: The quoted source cites 8 different sources of evidence that show there are no negative effects of delaying puberty in kids with gender dysphoria.
1.10.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.1.
1.10.1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.2.
1.10.1.3.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.3.
1.10.1.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.4.
1.10.1.3.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.14.2.5.
1.10.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.10.1.3.3. Con: The main evidence for possible negative consequences of puberty suppression is a study conducted on [sheep](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.10.016).
1.10.1.3.3.1. Pro: Medical studies on animals are often [poor predictors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2746847/) of how a human would react to a specific treatment or medication.
1.10.2. Con: Most statistics that claim that a big percentage of children confused about their gender 'outgrow' the problem after puberty have big [methodological](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/01/14/what_alarmist_articles_about_transgender_children_get_wrong.html) flaws such as putting any gender non-conforming kid in the same category. Therefore, most children that are found not to be transgender as teenagers or adults were not transgender to begin with.
1.11. Pro: Interfering with puberty through medical intervention means that puberty is being treated as a disorder.
1.11.1. Con: Our interference with the reproductive cycle via birth control does not signal that pregnancy is a disorder.
1.11.1.1. Con: Pregnancy is not a part of development.
1.11.2. Pro: We know that hormone blockers \([Lupron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leuprorelin)\) cause bone density loss and osteoporosis. There is even a challenge to US Congress to address the damage this drug causes.[Petition to US Congress](https://www.petition2congress.com/ctas/investigation-lupron-side-effects-leuprolide-acetate) that has over 11,000 signatures.
1.12. Pro: Choosing to transition should be a decision made when the individual is able to give meaningful consent.
1.12.1. Con: A person can be a consenting adult without going through gendered puberty.
1.12.1.1. Pro: Individuals with [Kallmann syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallmann_syndrome) never start or complete puberty.
1.12.1.2. Pro: If your puberty was delayed until your eighteenth birthday, you would legally be an adult and able to consent to medical treatment on your own, all before going through puberty.
1.12.2. Pro: An individual who has not gone through puberty cannot be considered an adult because puberty [triggers neural development](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3410522/) that turns a child into an adult.
1.12.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.12.2.2. Con: -> See 1.12.1.2.
1.12.3. Pro: Adulthood is socially defined as starting between 18-21 when the rights and responsibilities of adulthood are conferred. The decision-making parts of the brain \(frontal lobes\) [continue to develop](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=3051) until individuals are around 25 years of age.
1.12.4. Con: The understanding of what gender one identifies as may be complete at an earlier age than the understanding about other issues with which we usually wait until 18 years of age. Thus, decisions about gender may be meaningfully consented to before puberty.
1.13. Con: The decision to transition is closely tied to a deep sense of self and children are able to make that decision before they reach the age of majority.
1.13.1. Con: The decision to delay puberty may be one the child wants to make but ultimately it is adult parents and doctors who provide consent, since children are legally unable to consent to medical procedures that include body modification.
1.13.1.1. Con: There is absolutely no reason this decision should be made by parents or guardians. If a parent were to use their supposed claim to bodily autonomy to whip, or permanently scar a child, it would be nothing short of abuse.
1.13.1.1.1. Pro: Forcing medical treatment on a child is considered [child abuse](https://www.crin.org/en/home/what-we-do/policy/bodily-integrity). It could be argued that the withholding of medical treatment against a child's wishes could also be child abuse.
1.13.1.1.2. Con: Cultural traditions like infant circumcision are interventions that permanently change a child's body, but are not considered child abuse.
1.13.2. Con: Children are by default extremely vulnerable to the expectations of adults, and peers. The glorification of gender identity politics and the social media celebration of individuals who transition is a powerful influence for children who are hungry for external validation. This creates an incentive for children to draw dangerously hasty conclusions about identity.
1.13.2.1. Con: Many children are painfully aware that not abiding by the standard gender roles of their sex will make them a target for other children, and even sometimes the staff. [People have died for being openly out](https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-transgender-community-in-2017).
1.13.2.2. Con: Assuming this is true, that would be an excellent reason to wait with puberty.
1.13.3. Pro: Delaying puberty respects the child’s identity by helping them avoid the trauma of going through sexual maturation that is inconsistent with their gender identity.
1.13.4. Pro: Delaying puberty shows the child that they are understood and that their identity is not a disorder, even if that identity does not match their body.
1.13.5. Con: Children can't fully understand the full implications of choosing a gender identity.
1.13.6. Con: Puberty is a period when a young experiences sexuality for the first time. You can't know for certain what you like before gaining these experiences.
1.13.6.1. Pro: In adolescence, gender identity [might still be fluctuating](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51141445_Puberty_suppression_in_gender_identity_disorder_The_Amsterdam_experience).
