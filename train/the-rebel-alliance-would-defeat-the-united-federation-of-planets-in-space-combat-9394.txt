Discussion Title: The Rebel Alliance would defeat the United Federation of Planets in space combat.

1. The Rebel Alliance would defeat the United Federation of Planets in space combat.
1.1. Pro: The Federation's standard rules of engagement require it to not open fire unless fired upon. The Rebels would therefore be able to fire the first shot and - potentially - to cause significant damage.
1.1.1. Con: First blood doesn't make the end of the war.
1.1.2. Con: Drawing first blood would cede the moral high ground to the Federation, giving them the moral boast and bringing their civilian population behind the war, as Pearl Harbor did in WWII.
1.1.3. Con: Lasers are unable to penetrate Starfleet vessels' navigational deflectors, let alone their shields. The first shot would be meaningless--it could do no damage.
1.1.4. Con: While standard procedure in encountering unfamiliar ships is a peaceful, passive posture, Captains are also required to put the lives and safety of their ships and crew ahead of everything. If a Captain feels that there's a potential threat, he is given a modicum of latitude to ensure that safety.
1.1.5. Con: Once war is declared, they are no longer bound by that rule.
1.1.6. Con: Starfleet ships are heavily shielded because they expect to be fired on first.
1.1.6.1. Con: Shields are rarely up at the start of an episode. Star Fleet ships are not heavily armoured. Hence the first strike could be devastating.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: The level of armour of Starfleet vessels is questionable, as the hulls are automatically armoured and could range from inches, to feet, to meters, depending on the source. This is on-top of ablative armour found on Defiant and Prometheus class vessels and the ablative generators brought back by Voyager.
1.1.6.2. Con: Shields are a drain on the ship’s energy stores. They are not always “up” during sub-light travel.
1.1.6.2.1. Pro: This would be true for both sides however. Star Trek has 2 shields: deflector shields, and navigational shields. Deflector shields are combat shields. Navigational shields are said to be able to stop lasers and rockets \(they're designed to deflect objects moving at 1,000x the speed of light - at which speed, even a grain of dust or fleck of paint would punch through and hit like an atomic bomb due to E=mc²\).
1.1.7. Con: First blood perhaps, however Starfleet officers are infinitely more resourceful tacticians, able to account for both the anticipated and the unanticipated. Whilst daring gambles may be the signature move of the Rebels, these cavalier tactics would be easily countered by a Starfleet crew.
1.2. Pro: The Rebel Alliance have a greater exposure to different cultures and their ways of waging warfare than the Starfleet. This would give the rebels the advantage of greater cultural knowledge and fighting styles/training.
1.2.1. Con: Starfleet has many different species within its ranks, in addition Starfleet has ships specially tasked to literally explore the galaxy and seek out new civilizations and cultures. Starfleet is unlikely to be surprised by different fighting styles or training.
1.2.2. Pro: The rebels could have the advantage of multiple cultures having potentially mixed so well that there may be languages that they could use to communicate which could prevent their communications being read once intercepted.
1.2.2.1. Con: The United Federation of Planets has used Universal Translation technology for centuries.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The universal translator would render "alien language as code" ineffective.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Many languages have been shown in Star Trek to have evaded the capabilities of the universal translator.
1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: In each case, there were special considerations--the translator could translate the words, but not the context. \(Breen, Tamarians\) Starfleet does obviously have code-crackers, and the universal translator would put language-as-code on par with any other code even in the few situations it doesn't translate context.
1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Con: There's no reason to assume that Star Wars languages have the unique complexity to stump the universal translator.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Because the Rebels would see first-hand that Starfleet is translating the speech of their crews, they would have no reason to assume there are languages in their midst that would stump it. If they thought their words were being translated, it stands to reason they'd assume language as code would backfire on them.
1.2.2.2. Con: Because not all members of the rebellion speak these languages, and because especially the most skilled people might not be familiar with them at all, the Rebels would have to teach these languages to make them usable. This is more complex than merely distributing a code, and infiltrators \(Section 31, perhaps\) would more easily get this information than a normal code.
1.2.3. Con: This implies that these fighting styles and training are inherently known to all. There is no evidence on screen of rebel members being multidisciplinary. The collective theoretically having the knowledge does not mean the knowledge can be applied in practice. On the other hand, we do know that Starfleet members are actively trained in a variety of combat styles.
1.2.4. Pro: Having a greater and more diverse cultural knowledge enables a greater ability to more quickly read and adapt to new cultures.
1.2.5. Pro: Culture influences everything from social interaction to approaches to warfare. Tactics, technology, and training can be developed further when there's a larger, more diverse cultural knowledge to draw inspiration from.
1.2.5.1. Con: Starfleet benefits from this type of diversity because they integrate other races into all aspects of the Federation; Rebels live in a universe where diversity is a "separate, but 'equal'" kind, with a large number of single-race enclaves which each use their own brand of technology instead of sharing and boosting the collective knowledge. Starfleet is thus more capable of benefiting from diversity than the rebels.
1.2.6. Con: The Borg have assimilated the cultures, technology, and tactics of countless species; while the exposure to so many different cultures and their ways of waging warfare posed a hurdle to the Federation, it's one Starfleet was able to defeat.
1.3. Pro: The Rebel Alliance is willing to embrace tactics and strategies that the federation is unwilling to.
1.3.1. Pro: The Rebel Alliance is willing to employ terrorist tactics and has done so in the past.
1.3.1.1. Pro: As visible in Rogue One, the Partisans under Saw Gerrera use guerrilla tactics against Imperial forces in urban environments, seemingly without much consideration of the risks this poses to innocent civilians.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Gerrera also illustrates that these tactics are not representative of the Rebel Alliance's approach in general and not approved by the Rebels. Leaders such as Mon Mothma and Bail Organa see him critical and distance themselves from him.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Members of the Rebel Alliance have utilized suicide tactics as a last resort in the past, for example [Holdo](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Amilyn_Holdo), [Sato](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jun_Sato) and [Arvel Crynyd](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Arvel_Crynyd).
1.3.1.2.1. Con: The Federation has learned to fight against these tactics, as the Dominion used them as well. Dominion craft were also designed to maximize damage in a suicide run.
1.3.1.3. Con: The Federation has faced and overcome others who have employed similar tactics. While they did suffer losses, they did win in the end. Changlings, Maquis, Kahn \(both timelines\) are the main examples.
1.3.2. Con: [Section 31](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Section_31), the Federation's black ops division that remained in secrecy for over 200 years and engaged in morally indefensible actions for the defense of the Federation, would covertly employ all of the same extreme tactics the Rebel Alliance would choose to use.
1.3.2.1. Con: The article you used also points out the Section 31 is completely autonomous and not under the control of Star Fleet. Section 31 is not a tactic or strategy used for space battles. So there is no indication they would be involved in this space battle.
1.3.3. Con: The Federation has superior tacticians such as Vulcan's. The Alliance relies on luck, hot heads, space jockies and people with the Force. The Alliance could get out-smarted by smart "Spock types"
1.4. Con: The Federation has defeated several forces in the past which appear much superior to the Rebel Alliance.
1.4.1. Pro: The Federation defeated The Dominion, a far larger and superior force.
1.4.1.1. Con: The Dominion's defeat can be heavily attributed to the Cardassian revolution and the biological weapon designed by Section 31 to specifically target the Founders. The victory over the Dominion can therefore not be reliably attributed to the Federation's ship-to-ship fighting capability.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: The Cardassian revolution played very little overall impact on the course of the war. The Federation-Klingon-Romulan alliance was already winning by that point and by the time the military defected, were already on their way to Cardassia. The Dominion and female founder were not overly concerned by the uprising, as they had dealt with uprisings in the past, and had lost faith in the Cardassians by that point anyway.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Section 31 are \(nominally\) part of the Federation. Thus anything they can do to hamper the Rebellion would only aid the Federation.
1.4.1.1.3. Con: To suggest ship-to-ship fighting was irrelevant or their capability impossible to judge is disingenuous. Neither the revolution, nor the virus had anything to do with Operation Return, Any of the Battles in the Kelandra sector, the victories at Chin'toka. Ship-to-ship fighting carried the day in all these scenarios.
1.4.2. Pro: The Federation has had many successful engagements against The Borg Collective, who have assimilated the technologies and cultures of thousands of worlds.
1.4.2.1. Con: The Federation had far more disastrous encounters with the Borg.
1.4.3. Con: Many of the mentioned engagements against the Borg were either won through sheer luck or some form of outside interference \(Time Travellers, Q, etc\). The most well known engagements ended in severe amounts of casualties and lost ships \(See: Battle of Wolf 359, Battle of Sector 001\)
1.4.3.1. Pro: The war against the Borg lasted 22 years, much longer than a space combat would last. The Federation lost many of the early combats.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: This claim is misleading. There was no "front" against the Borg; they operated from the opposite side of the galaxy and only occasionally popped out of transwarp to harass Starfleet. There was no real ongoing war until Voyager entered Borg space.
1.4.4. Con: The Rebel Alliance is accustomed to fighting a superior force. That is their constant reality. The Federation rarely comes up against such opponents.
1.4.4.1. Con: The Federation frequently fights superior opponents, including the [Borg](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Borg), [Breen](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Energy_dissipator), [Dominion](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Dominion), [gods](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Apollo), [Tholians](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Tholian_web), [Romulans](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Romulan_technology), and more.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Not all of the above are necessarily superior.
1.5. Pro: The members and crews of the Rebel Alliance are suited better for space combat.
1.5.1. Pro: Starfleet has few to no fighter-size craft.
1.5.1.1. Pro: It was their lack of success against the Jem'Hadar \(and conversely, the success of Jem'Hadar fighters\) which spurred the Federation to re-assess the use of fighter craft. Shuttles & runabouts are poor substitutes for fighters.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Jem'hadar fighters were faster and more powerful than Starfleet technology, and Jem'hadar lives had so little value that they could be used as manned missiles as well. None of this implies any inherent value of fighters.
1.5.1.2. Pro: The Rebels have deployed [buzz droids](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Pistoeka_sabotage_droid) in the past and may do so again against the Federation, which would be particularly vulnurable to those form of attacks.
1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Rebels, used to hit-and-run tactics and other forms of ambush, would be able to mine capital ships to distract and disable their crew/ships, as well as make prolific use of buzz droids, which are even smaller than fighters and which, when deployed en masse, could wreak havoc on tactical hard points to Star Fleet ships of all sizes as well as shuttles and outposts.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: Star Trek craft have been known to be prone to mines \(numerous episodes from Enterprise forward illustrate this\).
1.5.1.2.1.2. Con: Shield systems or weapons systems might easily repel buzz droids.
1.5.1.2.1.3. Con: There's no telling that the buzz droid can pierce the hull plating of a federation vessel
1.5.1.2.2. Pro: Eight years after the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Free Ryloth movement modified large amounts of [buzz droids](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Pistoeka_sabotage_droid) to explode. They were stored inside modified vulture droids, and were used to attack the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Perilous over Ryloth. The Rebels could use this type of tactics against the Federation.
1.5.1.3. Con: "[Fighters](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Attack_fighter)" do exist within Star Fleet inventory, and in the case of the Dominion War, were fielded in great numbers. This raises doubts about claims that Star Fleet ships would enjoy great advantages defending against attacking Rebel Fighters as fighters were finally seen to be an effective asset in battle \(otherwise Star Fleet would presumably not have developed/used them\).
1.5.1.4. Con: One of the key reasons given the lack of fighters is that they can [easily be targeted and destroyed](https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-fighters-featured-or-used-in-Star-Trek) before they can get into range to do any serious damage.
1.5.1.4.1. Con: This apparent show of hubris was corrected during the Dominion War when Star fleet fielded it's own fighters in [significant numbers](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Federation_attack_fighter). Star Fleet was is [not alone](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Attack_fighter). Fighters were recognized as powerful assets.
1.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: Federation Fighters are more attack craft, each mounting 6 full sized Torpedo tubes, carrying 50 torpedoes each, a pair of phaser pulse cannons and a single almost uni-directional multi-role and mode phaser array.
1.5.1.4.1.2. Con: The Dominion were significantly more technologically advanced--it's not that Starfleet was prone to fighters, it's that Starfleet was prone to the loadout in those fighters, including enough explosives to make kamikaze attacks effective.
1.5.1.4.2. Pro: Starfleet computers are able to automatically track and fire on multiple targets at a time, from any direction. Going up against peers with fighters at that level of technology is suicide, rendering them mostly useless.
1.5.1.5. Pro: Many of the decisive battles of Star Wars see small figher-size crafts in crucial roles against much larger structures, for example the [Battle of Yavin](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Yavin) against the first Death Star, the [Battle of Endor](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Endor) against the second Death Star, and the [Battle of Starkiller Base](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Starkiller_Base).
1.5.1.5.1. Con: While Fighters are decisive in Star Wars, there is no evidence to support they would be in Star Trek. Quite the contrary to be honest.

Plus Federation ships are much smaller than the things that Rebel fighters are used to destroying, with far greater precision on their weapons.
1.5.1.5.2. Con: The effectiveness of Rebel fighters against Federation ships is questionable, and would be dependent on a lot more variables than are covered in the question of this debate.
1.5.1.6. Con: The Federation does actually have small ships.
1.5.1.6.1. Pro: Federation shuttles can be armed with Type IV and V phasers and micro-torpedo launchers. Danube class runabouts are routinely armed with multiple all around phaser arrays and can have a weapon pod with two micro torpedo launchers and extra phasers. Peregrine attack fighters carry 2 phasers arrays, a phaser cannon and 6 full torpedo launchers, meaning it can output the firepower of a capital ship, while being the size of a fighter. These are all examples of small craft used by the Federation.
1.5.1.7. Con: Federation small craft, Runabouts, Shuttles and Peregrine attack fighters, have robust shielding sometimes able to take capital ship fire, and their own warp cores, making them individually more powerful and much more durable than their opponent's small craft.
1.5.1.7.1. Con: Star Fleet was forced to reassess their ideas re: fighters during the Dominion War. They concluded, correctly, that fighters do make for formidable assets in battle. Shuttlecraft and runabouts, even heavily armed ones, make poor substitutes for purposed designed fighter craft.
1.5.1.7.1.1. Pro: Federation has the [Valkyrie class](http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Valkyrie_class) attack fighter, produced in the wake of the Dominion war.
1.5.1.7.2. Con: Many Federation shuttles are [unarmed](https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Type_7_shuttlecraft).
1.5.1.7.2.1. Con: That depends on the [type](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Federation_shuttle_classes). [Type 11](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Type_11_shuttlecraft) are usually armed and other [types](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Type_8_shuttlecraft) can be [armed](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Type_6_shuttlecraft) for special operations with a minimum of effort.
1.5.2. Con: Starfleet has newer and better maintained vessels than the members of the Rebel Alliance.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Star Wars took place a long time ago, and Star Trek is in our future. Star Trek has access to all the modern knowledge of many civilizations, some of which could be more modern versions of what were in Star Wars.
1.5.2.2. Con: That the Federation continues to utilize "generationally older ships" out of economy highlights the true nature of the organization: exploration and research. Defense is a secondary objective. War fighting organizations focus on just that, fighting wars.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Various [alternate-timeline](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Federation-Klingon_War_\(alternate_timeline\)) examples of the Federation also highlight the difference between the current Federation vs more militarized versions \(where the Federation has been forced to be a military focused organization\).
1.5.2.2.2. Con: The argument could be made that it is less out of economy or necessity and rather because they are an efficient and long lasting designs that they see no need to replace, only upgrade occasionally. That the designs can be so easily upgraded, so many times and for so long, and remain competitive, is testament to their flexibility.
1.5.2.2.2.1. Pro: Starfleet vessels also seem to be designed for greater flexibility - deflector dishes have been converted to phaser cannons several times, for example.
1.5.2.2.3. Con: Starfleet vessels are subject to far more rigorous maintenance schedules, while also having vastly superior supporting infrastructure. Many Rebel ships are left over from the Clone Wars, and have a very poor support network. Most Starfleet officers will recognise a Rebel ship's state of repair and exploit their weaknesses.
1.5.2.3. Con: The Federation also still employs 70+ year old vessels and designs such as the Excelsior class and Miranda class.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: The Excelsior class was considered to have an extremely long service life by Starfleet standards, but was also modified several times during its production run to feature more powerful weaponry and faster warp drives.
1.5.2.3.2. Con: These vessels are constantly refitted and retro-fitted to upgrade them to the latest technology and keep them up to date.
1.5.2.3.2.1. Con: While they are constantly updated and upgraded, there comes a time when they cannot be upgraded further due to design limitations. Both of the aforementioned classes are reaching or have reached that limit by the time of DS9.
1.5.2.4. Pro: The Rebels [main warship](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mon_Calamari_Star_Cruiser), the various Mon Cal cruisers, are notorious hard to build, repair and maintain. All Mon Calamari cruisers were handcrafted, ensuring that each vessel was different. Each vessel had a unique, seemingly random assortment of lumps and bumps dotting its surface. However, because the ships' designs were so varied, maintenance and repairing a damaged cruiser was often a long and difficult process.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: Starfleet vessels are normally constructed according to standardised designs in relatively short periods of time. They also have construction facilities all over Federation space. The Rebel Alliance seems to depend mostly on captured enemy ships, battlecruisers and fighters purchased on the second-hand market, or ships provided by private donors/sponsors.
1.5.2.5. Pro: Starfleet upgrades and refits even older designs, as seen with the Lakota mounting the [latest weaponry](https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/USS_Lakota). All older ships remain very reliably and well maintained craft from what has been shown, and upgraded ones are not much less formidable than newer warships.
1.5.3. Con: Starfleet represents a professionally trained military force. It is highly selective and provides rigorous specialist and cross-specialisation training. Therefore, Starfleet personnel are highly talented and skilful professionals, unlike the Rebel Alliance.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Federation ships are crewed by talented and experienced engineers who are used to inventing some new technological wizardry to turn the tide of conflict in a key moment. The Rebels almost never create new technology. The little they do create is done very slowly and distributed even slower.
1.5.3.2. Con: Wars are fought by Privates and Specialists, led by Sergeants, Commanded by Lieutenants and Captains. The Rebel Alliance depicts this, i.e. everyone is not an officer. They have infantry. Star Fleet consists overwhelmingly of officers and technical specialists \(Warrants at best\). Example: Away Teams are usually Command personnel \(from the bridge no less\). They are not organized to fight wars but to protect themselves while exploring. Time frame is a factor though \(in each universe\).
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: Throughout it's history, Star Fleet has placed an overwhelming amount of attention to officers and their[rank structure](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Starfleet_ranks) vs enlisted. By comparison with a contemporary [US Navy vessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticonderoga-class_cruiser), Star Fleet vessels are incredibly "top heavy". A comparison to other contemporary navies will probably reveal the same. This reinforces the idea that Star Fleet is not organized primarily as a warfighting entity, but science and exploration.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Con: Starfleet has both Commissioned and Non-Commissioned ranks, like contemporary militaries. Because shows focus on the officer main characters, does not mean the other ranks do not exist.
1.5.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Officer ranks have been shown to be: Cadet - \> Ensign -\> Jr. Lieutenant -\> Lieutenant -\> Lt. Commander -\> Commander-\> Captain -\> Rear Admiral -\> Vice Admiral -\> Admiral -\> Fleet Admiral
1.5.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Additional Ranks of Commodore and Fleet Captain were both seen and mentioned but eventually phased out. There's also mention of cadets 4th - 1st class. Rear and vice admiral were both also temporarily split as lower and upper halves as well before being recombined.
1.5.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: Non-Com ranks include: Crewman 3rd - 1st Class -\> Petty Officer 2nd-1st class -\> Chief petty officer \(Sometimes just known as "Chief"\) -\> Snr Chief Petty officer -\> M.Chief Petty Officer
1.5.3.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: This is on top of specialists and technicians and provisional ranks, and yeomen, which Starfleet seems to use interchangeably.
1.5.3.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Chiefs are often depicted as being Warrant Officers.
1.5.3.2.1.1.3. Pro: Starfleet is rarely shown to have ranks of Colonel, and Corporal, indicating the existence of another rank structure, likely for Starfleet Marines \(MACOs\) or an Army.
1.5.3.2.1.2. Pro: Picard himself says that Starfleet is not Military and they are not Soldiers. He claims they are Scientists, Diplomats and Explorers.
1.5.3.2.1.2.1. Con: David Marcus disagrees with him and says Starfleet is the Military. Starfleet is also the protective and defensive arm of the Federation. With rank structures.
1.5.3.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: All of Starfleet's enemies \(Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians, Dominion etc.\) consider them a Military organisation.
1.5.3.2.1.3. Con: Crew breakdowns vary per class/role of ship, with the most top-heavy mix being on dedicated scouts \(suggested to have a 65/35 split of officers to enlisted!\). Pure science vessels are suggested to have a 27/73 split.
1.5.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: On a Constitution class and Excelsior cruiser, the split was approximately 29/71. On a Galaxy or Nebula class Explorer it is approximately 32/68.
1.5.3.2.1.3.1.1. Con: These are still incredibly top-heavy compared to contemporary naval vessels, where even the most generous split is about 15/85 and often even more towards enlisted crews.
1.5.3.2.1.4. Con: Whether or not the Federation’s space exploration is humanitarian endeavor first and a military one second, the fact remains that the Federation has ultimately prevailed against all of its military foes in due time. The Rebel Alliance cannot say the same; as the First Order has managed to reduce it to a handful of resistors.
1.5.3.2.2. Con: Starfleet is organised more like the Navy or Airforce than the Army or the Marines, thus the comparison falls a little flat. It is also disingenuous to suggest that they focus only on Officers. The shows do as they are the main characters, but these represent fractions of the actual crew of the ships. We frequently see standard crewmen in the corridors.
1.5.3.2.2.1. Con: Sending Senior officers and Command staff on just about every single mission or away team is stunningly bad and poor practice and shows a lack of common sense and wisdom.
1.5.3.2.2.1.1. Con: There do seem to be regulations against it, as shown in Star Trek 2 and Star Trek the Next Generation, where Riker will not allow Picard to go on Missions.
1.5.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: That said, it seems most officers in The Original Series, Deep Space Nine and Voyager ignore these regulations entirely, showing an astounding lack of common sense and jeopardising the entire senior crew.
1.5.3.2.3. Con: Starfleet has grunts--Miles O'Brien was noted as one. However, most exploratory missions require officers because the team is expected to function relatively autonomously, and make decisions that could have wide political impact on the Federation; they often even have to speak on behalf of the Federation. This work is not appropriate for enlisted personnel to perform.
1.5.3.3. Con: The Rebel Alliance is an insurgency \(with political and military functions\). It's military structure is properly designed and organized to fulfill a military role. It operates using the basic principles of combined arms operations. I.e. it deploys units such as squads, platoons, companies, and battalions, [\(units,](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Rebel_Alliance_military_units) [vehicles,](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Rebel_Alliance_vehicles) [operations\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1DBG61Fl10). The Federation does not posses or regularly employ any analogs, nor is it organized in such a way that deploys the same form of units or operations.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: The [mission statement](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Starfleet) and core principles of the Federation/Star Fleet places exploration and science at the forefront with defense being a supporting objective. "The primary purpose of Starfleet from its infancy was to "...seek out new life and new civilizations," and "...go boldly where no man has gone before." - Zefram Cochrane, the inventor of warp drive on Earth.
1.5.3.3.1.1. Con: Starfleet is organized as a military force. While their primary goal is exploration, it is conducted by the military. A military which is extensively trained for front-line, guerilla, and covert operations in addition to exploration. These military tasks are the main aspects of the Academy that we've seen on screen.
1.5.3.3.2. Con: The Federation would be more analogous to a modern Navy than an Army, so such a comparison point is unfair. Starfleet does have the same basic structures as a Navy or Airforce...ships, squadrons, wings, flotillas, fleets etc.
1.5.3.3.3. Con: This would in fact put the Rebels at a disadvantage, in this case the Rebels have an army separate from a navy whereas Starfleet is the navy with infantry contained within this - Rebels would need troop transports of which would get destroyed quickly and have limited function in a naval ship battle.
1.5.3.3.4. Con: Just because we do not see them does not mean they do not exist. It is strongly implied in non-canon sources and in episodes of Deep Space Nine that such things do exist.
1.5.3.3.4.1. Con: However as we can only go on what we see on screen, we see no direct evidence of them. While there may be passing references to them, we cannot gauge their true effectiveness, nor assume their efficiency from words alone with no direct onscreen evidence.
1.5.3.4. Con: All Star Trek series show that Federation personnel are extremely poor hand-to-hand fighters, and additionally do not seem to have any weapons training, judging by the way they hold their weapons. They are more like scientists who happen to have guns in case something comes up. They do not seem to have undergone any combat training at all. Even the security personnel fit this profile.
1.5.3.4.1. Con: Vulcans, while pacifistic, are considerably stronger than Humans. \(to the point of crushing/bending steel bars\)
1.5.3.4.1.1. Con: Wookies are also much stronger than humans.
1.5.3.4.2. Con: Examples against this claim: Kirk, most rogue captain Kirk fights. Many of Sulu, Scotty, Riker, Worf, Sisko, Kira, Dax, Janeway, Torres, Tuvok, demonstrates hand to hand combat abilities in excess of those of Klingons and other noted warrior races who are feared in Hand to Hand combat, such as Jem'Hadar and Hirogen.
1.5.3.4.2.1. Con: The heroes in both series are much better fighters than the troopers of either. That is kind of standard fare in fiction.
1.5.3.4.2.2. Con: The way all these people fight, seems like random unskilled brawling to me.   Not anything near what trained combat is like. Compare: [youtu.be](https://youtu.be/GXO9FrZ1N9s) and [youtu.be](https://youtu.be/4SK0cUNMnMM)
1.5.3.4.2.2.1. Con: Starfleet is a military organisation, with it's own martial arts and hand-to-hand combat system taken from several member races. They are as well trained in hand-to-hand combat as any member of a modern military force. Their shooting accuracy is still better than trained imperial stormtroopers, the Rebellions main opponent on the ground. The rebellion are guerrillas and resistance fighters with no formal training.
1.5.3.4.2.2.2. Con: This is a personal opinion and not a fact
1.5.3.4.2.3. Con: The Klingons themselves demonstrate subpar hand to hand combat ability, so besting them is not impressive.
1.5.3.4.2.3.1. Con: In Star Trek, Klingons are supposed to be warriors. Background and lore states them to be good at hand to hand combat and melee fighters who train extensively. Regardless of personal opinion on their skill, the lore states they are considered skilled and expert melee fighters.
1.5.3.4.2.4. Con: [Worf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LnwLn9vnKo&feature=youtu.be&t=21s) is bad at hand to hand combat.
1.5.3.4.2.4.1. Con: There were some episodes of Deep Space Nine where he was effective in hand to hand combat. Notably [In Purgatory's Shadow](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/In_Purgatory%27s_Shadow_\(episode\)), [By Inferno's Light](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/By_Inferno%27s_Light_\(episode\)) and [Parallels](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Parallels_\(episode\)).
1.5.3.4.3. Con: And yet, Federation personnel often hold their own against Klingons and Jem Hadar, warrior species who are stronger than Humans and train extensively for hand to hand combat and efficient killing methods. To be able to take out even one or two in hand to hand should be considered an impressive feat if in universe lore is to be believed.
1.5.3.4.4. Con: Training is referenced on screen, including [Zero-G Combat training](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Zero-gravity_combat_training).
1.5.3.4.5. Con: Starfleet academy is a military academy that requires both a high level of intelligence and a high level of physical capability.
1.5.3.4.6. Con: Given that phasers fire off-axis at times, the firing style is more likely explained by auto-aim systems.
1.5.3.4.7. Con: This is immaterial, as the Rebels \(with very few exceptions\) actually showcase worse hand-to-hand abilities than Starfleet personnel. In fact, often, their combat tactics are far worse too.
1.5.3.4.8. Con: The Rebel troopers display a similar lack of ability in handling their weapons, and very poor discipline in a Dogfight.
1.5.3.5. Pro: Starfleet was able to assemble a massive fleet to protect Earth in a very small amount of time. The Rebel Alliance was only ever able to assemble small, rag-tag fleets with a few capital ships even with aggressive planning and abundant intelligence.
1.5.3.6. Con: A reading of Starfleet's orders and directives, particularly the Prime Directive, demonstrates that Starfleet does not consider itself first and foremost as a "professionally trained military force" but rather a group of explorers and scientists who have adopted a military posture out of necessity for the exploration of space. See:[Memory Alpha General Orders](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Starfleet_General_Orders_and_Regulations#Federation_Regulations)
1.5.3.7. Pro: Starfleet is composed of professional soldiers. The Rebel Alliance is largely volunteer. This creates assymetry in discipline and morale, and favors Starfleet.
1.5.3.7.1. Con: Starfleet is composed mostly of science and engineering officers, with a generally minimal security compliment deployed on most vessels. Furthermore, most security personnel are low rank and tend to die quickly on away missions, reflecting their lack of practical experience. At it's core, Starfleet is a scientific and diplomatic organization complimented by a minimal compliment of security personnel, not vice versa. They lack the staff & experience to excel in prolonged combat scenarios.
1.5.3.7.1.1. Pro: Starfleet Officers are not professional soldiers and many will gladly state this. Captain Picard, for example, repeatedly insists that Starfleet is not a military.
1.5.3.7.1.1.1. Con: The idea they are "amateurs" is not a fact. While Picard says that they are not soldiers, they are diplomats, scientists and explorers first and foremost. However, they are officers in a command structure, which donates military. Furthermore, Starfleet is the scientific and military arm of the Federation, designed to explore and defend it. This means that it is still a military organisation.
1.5.3.7.1.1.2. Con: Star Trek II refers to Starfleet as "The Military". The Klingons, Romulan, Bajorans, Cardassians et. al. all see Starfleet as military personnel \(not necessarily warriors, but still military\).
1.5.3.7.1.1.3. Con: Starfleet has fought numerous wars and either won them, or fought to a stalemate until peace could be made in all cases. A vast majority of its personnel could therefore at that point be referred to as "Veterans" with extensive combat experience.
1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1. Pro: This does not even take into account clashes, skirmishes and individual ship to ship battles, or one off engagements and incidents. When these are factored in, it becomes obvious that Starfleet officers are well trained, experienced and quite proficient.
1.5.3.7.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: They are also backed up by the technology to do their jobs well and to allow them to be victorious, be this offensive, defensive or medical technology.
1.5.3.7.1.2. Con: This is a gross over simplification. The actual branches we most commonly see on a Starship are: Command, Operations, Engineering, Security, Science and Medical. The splits of each serving on a vessel are different depending on the type/class/role of the vessel in question.
1.5.3.7.1.3. Con: Heads of Security tend to be Lieutenants or Lieutenant Commanders. That most standard security personnel are lower rank is natural. For example, military squads in real life are not made up of nothing but officers, so there is no reason to expect Starfleet ones to be different.
1.5.3.7.2. Pro: Starfleet not only has trained professionals The Federation still has a large [civilian volunteer environment](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Civilian_Federation_starships), it has them in all areas, from [every conceivable role, from catering, medical surgery, technician jobs, theology, engineering, teaching, performance or diplomacy](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Staff_officer)- therefore can volunteer for combat roles if the situation deems it necessary.
1.5.3.7.3. Pro: The Federation does have [marines](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Merchant_Marine) of which have [personal shield](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/54419/why-doesnt-starfleet-have-personal-shields)s, personal armour and assault weapons - these are designed [for boarding parties or ground attack.](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Army)
1.5.3.8. Pro: Starfleet is capable of better coordination between capital-size ships.
1.5.3.8.1. Con: While that may be true, Rebels have more experience with fighter craft. Also, remember that the capital ships of the Star Wars universe are [many times larger](https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/original.jpg) than the "capital ships" of the Federation.
1.5.3.8.1.1. Con: This is more true for the Empire than for the Rebellion. The CR90 Corvette is 150m long, The Nebulon B frigate/B2 are both about 300m long. A GR75 transport is 90m long. A corellian gunship is 120m. Even old bulk cruisers and dreadnought classes were only 600m.
1.5.3.8.1.1.1. Pro: As a comparison, the Constitution Class Cruiser was between 289 and 305m depending on refit. Excelsiors were 511m, Ambassador class are 526m, Galaxy Class are 642.5m, Sovereign class are 680m before refit and 703m post refit. The Defiant Class is 170m, Intrepid Class 345m, Nebula class 442m, Miranda class 277m, Prometheus class 415m, Akira class 464m. As can be seen, there is not a huge size difference.
1.5.3.8.1.1.2. Con: On the other hand, the Mon Cal cruisers were larger than Star Destroyers; scaling from the flyby of Home One before the jump to hyperspace in Return of the Jedi, the vessel is approximately three kilometers long.
1.5.3.8.1.1.2.1. Con: Home One is canonically 1300 meters long. Other mon cal cruisers being individually crafted, unique ships, ranged from 1200 to 1500 meters long. No Mon Cal ship in use by the Rebel Alliance \(while they were the Rebellion\) were as large as an ISD, much less the SSD.
1.5.3.8.1.1.2.1.1. Con: "Direct scaling of [Home One](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Home_One/Legends#Behind_the_scenes) in 'Return of the Jedi' implies a minimum length of approximately 2.5km, and some cinematic evidence suggests a length of several kilometers. 'The Return of the Jedi' script and novelization contradicts these later sources by describing Home One as the largest of the Rebel star cruisers, corresponding to its visual appearance in the film.".
1.5.3.8.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Much like the eight kilometer Executor figure, the 1300 meter Home One figure comes from West End Games, which just made up random stats for the Star Wars roleplaying game. The Executor's length was eventually corrected in later publications because WEG's figure is inaccurate. Home One's scaling is more subtle but WEG's figure is just as inaccurate.
1.5.3.8.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: On the info-graphic information bar on the side of [this screen](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Home_One), the size of Home One listed at 1300m. This is under "canon". This size is taken from the [Star Wars Encyclopedia of Starfighters and Other Vehicles](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Encyclopedia_of_Starfighters_and_Other_Vehicles), published in April 2018, and is canon, not some fan supposed "scaling", which is much less reliable source material.
1.5.3.8.1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: It is impossible for Home One to be only 1300 meters long, given how large it is [shown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZigWFyK2o#t=8s) when seen in relation to a corvette by its stern.
1.5.3.8.1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Regardless of how it's presented in film, the Home One is considered to be 1300m by canon.
1.5.3.8.1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The films are higher order canon, and that is not what they depict.
1.5.3.8.1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The films do not provide any concrete lengths or sizes for Star Destroyers, Super Star Destroyers, Mon Cal Cruisers, Home One, or any fighters. Therefore, scaling is based off other assumptions and other published source material. Disney have stated categorically that it is 1300m.
1.5.3.8.1.2. Con: To Use Star Wars own logic here:
"Size matters not. Judge me by my size do you?" ;\)

It's shown in Star Wars that bigger guns have a harder time hitting smaller ships. So Star Treks smaller ships and better manoeuvrability for it's cap ships would actually work in their favour.
1.5.3.8.1.2.1. Con: If that is the case, the smallest and most maneuverable ships are the Rebel Fighters, and the advantage would still be with the Alliance
1.5.3.8.1.2.1.1. Con: Unlike Star Wars ships, which require trained gunners, Star Trek ships are capable of automated point-defense.
1.5.3.8.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This would mean that any kind of disruption to Federation ship targeting computers, either from Ion weapons or other sources, would dramatically diminish or outright eliminate any disrupted Federation ship's combat capabilities.
1.5.3.8.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that Rebels have any weapons that would disrupt Federation targeting computers. That Imperial and Rebel ships are susceptible to ion weapons does not imply that Starfleet vessels are.
1.5.3.8.1.2.1.1.2. Con: A Federation runabout proved [unable to hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jdk2ujnkrBk#t=2m26s) a Dominion attack craft from a range of no more than a few hundred meters.
1.5.3.8.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: The Dominion were of significantly higher technological capability than the Federation--including speed and target prevention. This would not be a concern for low-tech vessels available to the Rebel Alliance.
1.5.3.8.1.2.1.2. Con: On the condition that the Fighters could actually hurt the Federation vessels, other than by ramming them. However, while Imperial and Rebel vessels have been shown on-screen to have trouble targeting small, fast, manoeuvrable fighters, Federation vessels have been shown to be just the opposite. They have no problems targeting small or fast moving objects, at range, and with precision shots.
1.5.3.8.1.2.1.3. Con: Rebel fighters, whilst effective against the much slower and sluggish imperial capital ships would enjoy no such advantage against a much more agile and faster Federation ship.
1.5.3.9. Pro: StarFleet has a high number of Combat tactics and manoeuvres that are referenced and shown in the show. This denotes a professional military with experience and implaced combat doctrine.
1.5.3.9.1. Pro: The tactics are regularly drilled and practised - as well as never before seen by the rebels
1.5.3.9.1.1. Pro: Starfleet uses [Battle simulations](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Starfleet_battle_simulation) to help train the crewmen and cadets in ways to act and behave in combat scenarios, this allows the crew to drill themselves in being calm, smart, coordinated, effective and prepared in the event of an actual combat situation.
1.5.3.9.1.1.1. Pro: Starfleet employs a [psych test](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Coming_of_Age_\(episode\)) to make cadets face their greatest fears, as a means of teaching them to think and act through stress.
1.5.3.9.1.2. Pro: The [Kobayashi Maru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru) was an unwinnable battle simulation which showed that sometimes there would be a situation where you would not be able to win a battle and that you had to deal with losing but by achieving this loss through as careful means as possible to reduce unnecessary loss of life. Kirk cheated on this at the academy but used that as an example that when you can't win, change the rules, this means they could try to take advantage of unexpected elements to turn the battle to their favour.
1.5.3.9.1.2.1. Pro: The Stargazer utilized the [Picard Manuever](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Picard_Maneuver) to "change the rules" in a nearly guaranteed loss scenario.
1.5.3.9.1.2.2. Pro: In "The Deadly Years", Kirk "changed the rules" again by sending a message in a code that had been broken to scare off a superior opponent.
1.5.3.9.2. Pro: [Advanced tactical training](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Advanced_Tactical_Training) allowed crewman to double as soldiers if need be, anything from fighter pilots or rifleman - this could be as well as any profession for example such as engineer or theoretical warp technician so that this crewman would be much more useful to the ship.
1.5.3.9.2.1. Pro: The holodeck is provides a superior training environment--unique enemy situations can be replicated without additional cost or space, while on the move. The rebels cannot match this kind of "on the fly" training, that was used to send Picard and crew on a covert operation in Cardassian space, gave Troi her command training, and permitted LaForge to troubleshoot with a re-creation of Leah Brahms.
1.5.3.9.3. Pro: Federation ships use [Standard manoeuvres](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Standard_maneuvers) of which are a series of digitally stored patterns and movements that can strategically enhance the position of the ship for the most effective damage, protection, evasion or distraction, these are practised by the crew and loaded into the ship helm control.
1.5.3.10. Pro: Starfleet officers are taught to be extremely inventive, creative and adaptable. Free thinking and capable of independent thought and action, while also disciplined and following the chain of command.
1.5.3.10.1. Con: As are the Rebels including the non officers. The Rebels' ingenuity is one of their traits.
1.5.3.10.2. Con: Rebel officers have all those qualities because of life experience. For example, Lando Calrissian during the attack on Death Star II.
1.5.3.10.2.1. Con: These tend to be the exception and not the rule: Counter example: Wedge Antilles, an experienced pilot is sceptical during the first Death Star Attack, and Admiral Akbar would prefer to retreat and seems sceptical of Lando's innovative tactic.
1.5.3.10.2.1.1. Con: Akbar prefers only one tactic, taking evasive action.
1.5.3.10.3. Pro: This is demonstrated by the large number of personal manoeuvres, tactics and strategies as well as modifications to manoeuvres and tactics employed by numerous characters throughout the shows.

Sisko shows himself to be an excellent Strategist and Strategic thinker.
1.5.3.10.4. Pro: It can also be demonstrated by the number of unique and highly creative solutions they come up with to problems.

This includes some Unotherdox tactics
Examples: Riker: Best of Both Worlds Part II.  
Data: Redemption part II
1.5.3.11. Pro: In a boarding action, the Federations [Transporters](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Transporter) and [Phasers](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Phaser), which are superior to Star Wars blasters in their utility and potential power output, would give them an advantage.
1.5.3.11.1. Pro: Transporters allow for quick boarding. Star Wars ships, Imperial or Rebel, do not have the capability to detect transporter signals, as they have never seen any technology of the sort. They still rely on hanger bays.
1.5.3.11.2. Con: Phaser weapons of the Federation have wildly non-ergonomic designs not conducive to practical use, and routinely fail to penetrate simple packing crates.  Blasters do [this](https://imgur.com/1JZTdWI).
1.5.3.11.2.1. Con: Ergonomics are irrelevant in a device that had demonstrated targeting-assist abilities--they often fire off-axis.
1.5.3.11.2.2. Con: Phasers come in a variety of form factors to fit their intended use. The type 2 being referenced here is in the pistol category; a Type 3 Phaser Rifle is more akin to the blasters, and has similar ergonomics.
1.5.3.11.2.3. Con: And yet phasers routinely disintegrate living flesh and begins, not to mention cause shielded matter to exhibit light mechanical fracturing damage. Approximately 650 cubic meters of rock are disintegrated per shot at the highest setting, as well as being capable of [vaporising half a building](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Frame_of_Mind_\(episode\)) in a single shot.
When set to overload, they could take out several decks and breech the hull.
This is all beyond blasters.
1.5.3.11.2.4. Con: This would depends heavily on the type of phaser and time frame as the designs vary considerably.
1.5.3.11.2.4.1. Pro: The Type 2 Phaser pistols of Kirks Day \(not to mention Laser Pistols of Pikes\) Star Trek The Original Series - ST:VI, looked a lot like handguns, despite a wide variety of designs, and the one use of the phaser rifle looked vaguely like contemporary \(for the time\) rifle. They also occasionally used Type 1's.
1.5.3.11.2.4.1.1. Pro: [Type 1](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Type_1_phaserhttp://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Type_1_phaser)phasers used during Next Gen Era \(The Next Generation, DS9, Voyager and the last 4 movies\) tended to be [palm sized](http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Type-1_phaser). In Kirks day, the Type 1 actually fitted into the top of the type 2. All versions were designed to be easily concealable.
1.5.3.11.2.4.1.2. Pro: While the [Type 2 Phaser pistols](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Type_2_phaser) of the Next Generation era started very bulky and awkward, they eventually changed to be quite practical and easy to use, despite the [non standard design](http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Type-2_phaser) we may be used to. By the end they were actually so curved to essentially be very practical.
1.5.3.11.2.4.1.3. Pro: The [Type 3 phaser rifle](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Type_3_phaser) in many cases looks like a modern rifle. In the early Next Generation era, it is essentially a[Type 2 with a fitted stock and grip](http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Type-3_phaser), with much of it serving as extra power pack. Admittedly not a comfortable or practical looking design, this[later evolved](https://wiki.starbase118.net/wiki/index.php?title=Phaser_rifle) to far more familiar and practical designs as time went on.
1.5.3.11.2.5. Con: The reason the majority of phaser strikes do little to no damage is down to the fact that the majority of phaser strikes are on the stun setting.
1.5.3.11.2.5.1. Pro: A phaser has upwards of 16 settings, the first 3 of which are stun settings, ranging up through heat, kill right to disrupt and disintegration.
1.5.4. Con: The Rebel Alliance is a volunteer group with little to no training, and as shown in Star Wars: Rogue One, they're governed pretty loosely so there is likely to be little policy surrounding the specific training or restrictions of the recruits.
1.5.5. Pro: The Rebel Alliance has crews of thousands aboard cruisers whereas the highest crew complement of a Federation vessel was just over one thousand and that was majoritively the families of the officers and civilian crew. This would mean in a boarding scenario the Rebel Alliance would definitely have the advantage if there was ever any man-to-man combat.
1.5.5.1. Con: The Federation has the weapons and training of which could counteract any advantage in numbers such as [wide](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Phaser?file=Phaser_sweep_guest_quarters.jpg) [beam](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Phaser?file=Wide_beam_dispersal_phaser.jpg) or [split beam](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Phaser?file=Sulu_heating_Rock.jpg) weapons \(or settings\). This allows, for example, the flooding of corridors.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: The few force users in the Rebel Alliance are effectively nullified by a phaser firing on wide beam setting. A lightsaber won't be able to deflect a beam that's essentially surrounding the force user. Force jumping is similarly useless as an escape tactic. A choke or lightning may be able to stop a single red shirt while the next is firing. A push or pull may pose a temporary obstacle, but isn't a perpetual defense.
1.5.5.2. Con: Starfleet vessels are designed with automation in mind: crews are smaller because they need fewer people to perform the work. The majority of the Rebel crews will be useless in boarding actions--they have other jobs to perform, and the notion of a skeleton crew would be much higher.
1.5.5.3. Con: This makes the assumption that boarding would be possible. Boarding craft would not be able to slip through shields; and if they somehow took damage that prevented warping out, we've seen that captains will activate self-destruct before permitting their ship to be taken. That warp core explosion would take out a large number of attacking vessels completely.
1.5.5.4. Con: Families and civilians are not a given; they were aboard during peacetime, but DS9 showed that civilians were removed from vessels during war.
1.5.5.4.1. Pro: It could be speculated that these could be replaced with marines or combat personnel.
1.5.5.5. Con: This has been shown several times, that starfleet vessels have multiple defensive options in a boarding scenario. This includes internal force fields, holographic decoys, mobile point defense placements, and intra-ship transportation for deploying reinforcements.
1.5.5.5.1. Pro: Internal force fields would be especially effective for containing Rebel borders.
1.5.5.5.2. Pro: As seen in both TNG and at least 2 Deep Space 9 episodes, including "To the Death" automated defence and weapon systems are an accepted development and their efficiency and deadliness undisputed.
1.5.6. Con: Federation ships seem to have a better ability to repair or re-route power to un-damaged sections, etc. Lots of engineering officers working in the background. Rebel ships don't seem to do this.
1.5.7. Con: The Federation has better prepared and well-trained military forces.
1.5.7.1. Pro: While the Rebels are undoubtedly good at espionage, sabotage and infiltration, they have never faced a foe as skilled as Section 31, who would not only counter-infiltrate them but would also be able to critically undermine and destabilise them.
1.5.7.1.1. Pro: Section 31 successfully hid their existence, not just from Starfleet and their own Government, but from most of Starfleets enemies, including elite intelligence agencies like the Cardassian Obsidian Order and the Romulan Tal Shiar, for almost 220 years!
1.5.7.1.2. Pro: Section 31 successfully infiltrated both the Tal Shiar and The Obsidian Order, without being detected.
1.5.7.1.3. Pro: Section 31 were able to genetically engineer a virus, that the technologically advanced Dominion, masters of genetic engineering, could not cure. They also successfully managed to infect every Founder with it, without being noticed or raising suspicion. They did this, preempting the Dominion war and already predicting its start and its outcome, and taking the contingency in place.
1.5.7.1.4. Con: There might not be time for either side to infiltrate the other
1.5.7.2. Pro: Starfleet officers tend to be able to adapt to enemy tactics faster and more effectively than Rebel commanders, which most Starfleet captains will soon find easily predictable.
1.5.8. Pro: Federation ships have a disproportionate volume devoted to crew rest and relaxation vs armaments/munitions and combat systems. The presence of families on board also indicates that Federation ships are not primarily warships.
1.5.8.1. Pro: In contrast to the Federation, the design philosophy of the Klingon Empire is to build warships first and foremost. The Federation has actually designed very few purpose built warships. The USS Defiant being a notable example \(all due respect to the USS Ares\).
1.5.8.2. Con: There are many combat designed ships in Starfleet, usually on a much smaller crew complement than others but have enhanced weapons capability and fighter hangars. While these are not warships, they are still designed for combat situations but have been used in war in many applications throughout many series. These can be, [Federation class Dreadnought](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Federation_class), [Centaur type destroyer](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Centaur_type), [Defiant Class Escort](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Defiant_class), New Orleans class, [Prometheus Class Prototype Tactical Cruiser](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Prometheus_class) [Sovereign class](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Sovereign_class).
1.5.9. Con: The fleet compositions of both factions go into Starfleets favour over Rebel Alliance. Starfleet mostly uses larger ships with omnidirectional sensor tracking and targeting that counters both smaller and larger craft. Rebel Alliance relies on mostly on fighters with mostly forward facing weaponry depending on LOS tracking, small corvetes/frigates that act as picket ships countering fighters and support transports like medical frigates. The ammount of cruisers Rebel alliance has is limited.
1.5.10. Con: The Federation is much better suited to boarding enemy ships.
1.5.10.1. Pro: In a protracted conflict, you need to have places to rest, repair, refuel, and restock. If you cannot maintain a presence on worlds to do this, you may win your battles at first but as your resources and personnel get tired and stretched you may start losing what was once winnable. Even quick strikes into hostile territory may be followed by troops to maintain supply lines.
1.5.11. Pro: The dreadnought-type of ships the Rebels have access to would likely prove effective against the Federation who's struggled against dreadnoughts in the past.
1.5.11.1. Pro: The Rebels used massive Mon Calamari cruiser capital ships, which might be considered battleships or dreadnoughts by Star Trek standards, with an assortment of frigate and corvette picket ships in tandem with strike fighter craft, many of which might be considered elite, due to the extra technology they employed over their Imperial counterparts.
1.5.11.2. Pro: A Borg cube and the IKS Negh'Var both decimated the massive Federation fleets that engaged them, and Jem'Hadar light corvettes were highly successful against Federation cruisers, prompting the development of the Defiant as a counter.
1.6. Pro: The Federation is bound to a much higher degree than the Rebels by rules and regulations, and by the imperative to take the consequences of actions into account. This could be a handicap in combat.
1.6.1. Con: If you look at the way that Starfleet captains have behaved in the field they are less reliant on red tape than you make out. A ships captain has pretty much autonomous control of the ship and can make choices as they see fit. Captains report to an Admiral who makes strategical choices, which makes an overall better fighting force than just a rag tag group of disorganised fighters.
1.6.2. Con: When pressed, the Federation is able to adapt and move quickly. Examples are: Dominion war, Borg incursion, first Romulan war.
1.6.3. Con: With more rules and regulations there's more discipline and understandable procedural ways of doing everything which could allow for it all to be streamlined and easier to memorise through training.
1.6.4. Con: The reckless nature of some rebels could lead them to make quick, emotional and reactionary decisions which could end badly.
1.6.5. Pro: This could allow a rebel fleet to react autonomously, even after their admiral has died or flagship been destroyed.
1.6.5.1. Con: This is not unique to the Rebels, and thus is not a pro to the parent. Starfleet officers can also [react autonomously](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Acting_captain) after the death or incapacitation of command officers. The chain of command explicitly exists to permit this.
1.6.6. Con: Rules and regulations force more discipline and, therefore, better combat decisions.
1.6.7. Con: The Federation's rules and regulations are based on principles of following rules of war; which could help it sustain popular support and allies better than an organization ignoring those rules.
1.7. Con: Starfleet is resilient and recovers from loss quickly: Wolf 359 wiped out a large chunk of the Federation's forces. The Dominion did as well. Thanks to replicators and recruiting on a quadrant-wide scale, fleet losses are a temporary setback.
1.8. Pro: The Rebellion is better at creating and maintaining high morale.
1.8.1. Con: Federation ships provide a more comfortable environment for their crews, for example through family spaces and relaxation areas, which Rebel ships do not have.
1.8.2. Con: Starfleet is always the underdog. They are peaceful group who believes in diplomacy and working together surrounded by warlike species such as the Klingons and Romulans. Despite this the Federation is so persausive that they manage to even ally with these people.
1.8.3. Con: Federation ships even in war offer high quality psychological services often via counsellors. High quality medical facilities offer survival. Holodecks offer unlimited recreation even during war. Also many of the newer federation ships are not designed for civilian use. The Defiant class Heavy Escort, Prometheus class advanced Escort and the Sovereign Class, which has been labelled both an Assault Cruiser and a Dreadnought demonstrate this truth.
1.8.4. Con: The Federation has a stronger track record with regards to overall leadership. The Federation has ushered in prosperity across worlds in peacetime, and while it has been shaken in war it has always endured. The Rebels are survivors par excellence, but their leadership is much weaker on the whole. After the Alliance completely broke the Empire at the Battle of Yavin, the Empire was able to regroup, rebound, and all but annihilate the Alliance by the end of The Last Jedi some thirty years later.
1.8.5. Con: The Rebellion is only capable of providing relief from a fascist government, not providing a peaceful one. The non-combatant component plus molecular assembly technology of Federation Capital Ships means that each one can industrialize a planet on its own. One Galaxy class ship could install food replication services, medical services, diplomatic training, educational infrastructure, et cetera into any planet in the outer-rim or unmapped areas of the republic.
1.8.6. Con: Higher morale only counts if you ignore that the rebellion is supported by droid-slavery. Federation scientists would, as soon as they discovered this weakness, undoubtedly find ways to remotely disable restraining bolts and create hidden memory reservoirs to allow regularly memory-wiped droids in sensitive positions the time and perspective to form their own opinions and motivations.
1.8.6.1. Con: The OP states space combat, not a prolonged war. Federation scientists are unlikely to discover this weakness and take action during a single battle. For example, it took almost 20 episodes to defeat the Borg. These 20 episodes cover from Stardate 2356 to Stardate 2378.
1.8.6.1.1. Con: The opposite is demonstrated on screen. Starfleet found numerous weaknesses and took advantage of them in every fight. The problem is that the Borg adapt to Starfleet's adaptations, creating an infinite arms race through each episode.
1.8.6.1.2. Con: It's common practice to [modify existing technologies](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Navigational_deflector) to get a new, desired outcome, even in battle.
1.8.6.2. Pro: Capitalist constraints on A.I. development have kept the Republic's tech vulnerable.
1.8.7. Con: The entire basis of StarFleet is as an organization that provides for learning, growth, service, and exploration. These are all qualities that increase morale. They consistently show that they will never give up, even when facing god beings, such as Enterprises various encounters with Q or DS9s war against the Dominion.
1.8.8. Con: The rebels will have difficulties maintaining morale against the Federation, as the Federation values are more in line with theirs. Assuming the Federation is still in alliance with the Klingons, and can keep their actions in check, the rebels will have hard time finding reasons to fight against them.
1.8.8.1. Con: Many battles have been fought on earth between nations with similar values. The concern for morale would count more for a war than a battle.
1.8.9. Pro: The Rebellion are used to being the under dogs and fighting a superior foe. They exist in a constant state of war.
1.8.9.1. Con: The Federation is often the underdog. The Borg and Dominion were prominent examples of this. This is not unique to the Rebels.
1.8.10. Pro: The Federation, as a largely peaceful organisation and force, would hesitate and suffers from war fatigue and plunging morale quickly and may be inclined to run away or surrender.
1.8.10.1. Con: The Federation would be bound by superior morale, training and experience not to flee. They are a professional force and do not take desertion lightly, unlike the Rebel Alliance, a percentage of which are Imperial deserters.
1.8.10.2. Con: Federation vessels have facilities on them designed for supporting crewmen through difficult times and the trauma they may experience on a battlefield - because of this it would be incredibly hard to break the morale of a Federation crew, let alone an entire fleet
1.8.10.3. Con: The only effects the Federation might experience from war fatigue are the same or equal with those which affect the Rebellion constantly, to the same degree considering they are a Rebellion fighting a guerrilla war not a fully fledged government, just an alliance of terrorist cells whom of which don't always agree - in this sense there would be no penalty for any of these men for betraying their allies as their allies are already viewed as criminals or freedom fighters \(depending on who you ask\)
1.8.10.4. Con: Though there are examples of war fatigue and low morale in Deep Space 9, it is worth noting that the Federation did not give up or surrender and even resisted the idea when some tried to put it forward or force it.
1.8.11. Con: Whilst primarily an exploration force, the federation are used to fighting wars, in its short history they have tackled the Xindi, the Klingons, the Romulans, the Cardassians, the Borg, the Dominion, the Tzenkethi, the Maquis, the Gorn, the Sheliak, and the Tholians. The only time federation morale suffered during these wars was when homeworlds where captured or attacked rather than during deep space ship combat.
1.8.11.1. Con: Morale was low after the single Borg cube defeated the Federation fleet at Wolf 359.
1.8.11.1.1. Pro: And lower still during the Dominion War, when many believed they could not win.
1.8.11.1.2. Con: Many Starfleet officers display a "never give up" attitude.

Sisko: "Then we will fight, and we will fight, until we can't fight anymore!"
1.9. Con: Starfleet's core philosophy is adaptability. This enables them to eventually exceed even superior foes in the long-run.
1.9.1. Pro: Starfleet ships can be refitted or retrofitted to fit new, situational needs. [Some ship designs](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Nebula_class) even employ [modular techniques](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Nebula_class) to allow a quick change of functional role.
1.9.2. Pro: Starfleet developed [new weaponry](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Nebula_class) to combat Borg vessels, and were seen to adapt conventional weaponry to target the [unique weaknesses of the Borg](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Phaser_adapter) in the heat of battle.
1.9.3. Pro: Starfleet designed the [Defiant](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Defiant_class) from the ground up just to fight the Borg. This meant adopting and creating whole new design philosophies and technologies in a relatively short timeframe.
1.9.4. Pro: The wide range of Starfleet training--leaving crew to function as [diplomats one day](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Liaisons_\(episode\)) and [covert operatives another](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Chain_of_Command,_Part_I_\(episode\)), makes Starfleet not only adept at pivoting their tactics, but also makes their people more receptive to doing so.
1.9.5. Con: Starfleet failed to effectively adapt to the Maquis, which was a rebel force structured similarly to the Rebel Alliance. \(e.g. Guerrilla tactics, decentralized leadership, development of possible sympathies within Starfleet itself.\)
1.10. Con: Starfleet's curiosity and ingenuity is a strength unmatched by the Rebels.
1.10.1. Pro: Starfleet wanted to know more about the inside of stars, so they helped foreign researchers design [better shields](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Metaphasic_shield).
1.10.2. Pro: Starfleet wanted to understand other cultures, so they developed universal translators to facilitate personal exchange, and "melting pot" living conditions.
1.10.3. Pro: Starfleet's curiosity about the universe led them to defy [aggressive overtures from godlike beings](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Encounter_at_Farpoint_\(episode\)) who introduced them to great danger. They overcome every such danger.
1.10.4. Pro: Starfleet's crews created new technologies because they heard the Borg wiped out other species and were [curious to see who they were](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Erin_Hansen).
1.11. Con: Federation ships are better suited for battle.
1.11.1. Pro: The Federation's ships are technologically superior to those of the Rebel Alliance.
1.11.1.1. Pro: The exponential development of technology in Star Trek far outstrips the same development in the existing time frame of the Rebel alliance.
1.11.1.1.1. Con: The scale of scientific advancement would have little-to-no bearing in a single fleet engagement.
1.11.1.2. Con: The Rebel Alliance defeated the Empire which had far superior technological advances than the Rebels.
1.11.1.2.1. Con: Those defeats were bound to the narrative, and does not reflect tactical superiority. They were able to win due to traitors to the Empire and the hubris of various Sith lords, as well as shockingly poor security design. The Federation is unlikely to have similar challenges.
1.11.1.2.2. Con: The Empire and the Rebels had the same technology. The only marked change in the technology of the time was the Death star \(which, if we're honest didn't help anyone\), and the X-Wing.
1.11.1.3. Pro: The Federation has shown to posses a lot of bypass systems and redundancy. Especially if you would consider what Voyager brought to the Federation after its journey to the Delta quadrant. If jammed, the ship's computers and engineers would find a bypass.
1.11.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.8.1.2.1.1.
1.11.1.5. Con: The Rebel Alliance had a clear speed advantage by a factor of 1,000. Whereas the Federation's vessels can travel four light years per day, the Rebel Alliance's fleet can do [over 4,000 light years per day](https://www.tor.com/2014/12/08/star-wars-how-fast-is-the-millennium-falcon/).
1.11.1.5.1. Con: With the acquisition of Borg transwarp technology, this has now swung the other way.
1.11.1.5.2. Pro: Combined with the Rebels' advantage in long range communication, this speed advantage means that in a single battle more rebel ships could join before the battle concludes.
1.11.1.5.2.1. Con: This would be dependent on where the battle takes place. A Rebel attack is likely to be some distance from their bases. Even at 4,000 ly a day, if they are 40,000 ly away, they would take 10 days to arrive. Even if we said it was 4,000 ly an hour, they would still take 10 hours. A lot can happen in 10 hours.
1.11.1.5.3. Con: Real space FTL \(Faster Than Light\): Star Wars uses hyperdrive, which is not real space FTL. Star Trek uses warp drive and can still interact with real space. The Picard manoeuvre is even based on this. As Star Wars cannot even come close to FTL in real space, it is doubtful they could track it, much less target or engage at it.
1.11.1.5.4. Con: Federation engineers would likely be able to quickly steal and reverse-engineer such tech thanks to their extremely advanced levels of research, manufacture, and the use of teleportation for espionage. As soon as a single ship with hyperspace capability was infiltrated, debilitated or captured intact enough for the Federation to work with; time would quickly run out for the Rebel Alliance.
1.11.1.5.4.1. Pro: Starfleet engineers did exactly this against the Breen energy dissipating weapon.
1.11.1.5.4.2. Pro: The Federation did this with cloaking technology--to such extreme level of skill that they surpassed the original design.
1.11.1.5.5. Con: Depending on when in the Star Trek timeline the battle is placed, that isn't true. Voyager's maximum speed was stated at warp 9.75, which \(very\) roughly equates to 8x10^14 m/s, which is actually faster than the 4,000 light years per day here. Whilst this speed is clearly not something that happens a lot in the timeline, by the end of the 24th century one would be justified to imagine standard warp speeds reaching this sort of level.
1.11.1.5.6. Con: Technically, Federation ships can match SW ships in speed. The problem is that within the Star Trek universe, it's too risky to try. Re: ST: TNG episode "Where No One Has Gone Before," The 1701-D passed Warp 10 and ended up outside the boundaries of the universe itself \(which was really not a good thing\). So, whose universe are we fighting in, and with what rules? If were fighting in the Trek universe, those hyperspace advantages of SW vessels could prove to be a liability.
1.11.1.5.7. Pro: A speed difference of 1000 times is a strategic advantage that cannot be matched by the tactical advantage of having greater short-range speed and precision. If a fleet can move from one place to another in a minute and it takes the enemy 16 hours to follow them, then that fleet almost never has to engage in battle unless they are completely sure that they will win.
1.11.1.5.7.1. Con: Because Starfleet vessels can fire while moving faster than light, they can hit the Rebels before they know what hits them or position themselves in an advantageous fashion before engaging.
1.11.1.5.7.2. Con: That just means that the Rebels would run away from every battle, which is not winning in space combat but fleeing combat instead. Thus the Federation would win in space combat.
1.11.1.5.7.2.1. Con: Moving around quickly and even temporarily withdrawing does not mean the Rebels would be running away. These behaviors can be of tactical use, for example to draw the Federation into ambushes or otherwise unfavorable circumstances.
1.11.1.5.7.2.1.1. Con: Given the enhanced ranges of federation sensors, weapons, sublight speed and their ability to attack at FTL speeds, it would be unlikely that any rebellion ambush would be successful.
1.11.1.5.7.2.2. Con: The Rebels would not need to run away from every battle, just every battle where they're outmatched. Thus winning all other battles against severely stretched out Federation forces, that have to be everywhere at once to defend their space, because they're so much slower and can't respond to any attacks unless they are very close.
1.11.1.5.7.2.2.1. Con: Their definition of "out matched" might not be sufficient, given that technological parity, sub-light speed, range and destructive output are unknown or seem to favour the Federation.

If it takes the entire Rebellion to equal one Federation Ship of the Line, the scales of battle would not be in their favour very often.
1.11.1.5.7.2.2.1.1. Pro: This also assumes they can find lone ships to attack or Ambush, or bring sufficient numbers to bear.
1.11.1.5.7.2.2.1.2. Pro: Static targets also have surface to orbit defences, starbases, space stations, defence platforms and sattelites and defence grids/perimeters, automated defences and smaller, older and/or sub-light craft to defend them.

These assets alone may be enough to route a Rebel attack, especially if any ships or fleets are in the area.
1.11.1.5.7.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Their static nature would make them much easier for the Rebels to deal with or overwhelm and likely allow them to be circumvented or overpowered much more easily as one of the Federations chief advantages, sub-light speed, would be removed.
1.11.1.5.7.2.2.2. Con: They may not be able to run away from more than a handful of engagements before the tactic becomes no longer viable.

As stated elsewhere, the Federation could use their warp engines to create warp mass bubbles, or turn their deflectors into giant graviton emitters, essentially meaning every Federation starship could act as an Interdictor. The Rebels would not be able to run away from them.

Attrition would soon take its toll on the Rebellion. Probably far sooner than on Starfleet.
1.11.1.5.7.2.2.2.1. Pro: With some modifications the Federation could even turn their torpedoes into Graviton burst Torpedoes, creating localised areas where hyperspace temporarily wouldn't work. This could further frustrate Rebel efforts to escape.
1.11.1.5.7.3. Con: Due to the inability to interact with or even scan real space while in Hyperspace, this would limit the Rebels to running away from every battle or only attacking static, strategic targets.
1.11.1.5.7.3.1. Pro: The Rebels would be unable to Locate Federation ships or Fleets.
1.11.1.5.7.3.2. Con: Although hyperspace is not precise, when attacking static, strategic targets, the Rebels could drop out of hyperspace almost right on top of them. This would negate the Federations range advantage.
1.11.1.5.7.3.2.1. Con: True, however as the Federation are significantly faster at Sub-light speed, they can easily open the range again and remain out of Star Wars ships range, assuming they can weather an initial barrage.
1.11.1.5.7.3.2.2. Con: The Federation would be able to initiate micro warp jumps with high precision to open the range even faster in a way Star Wars couldn't even begin to match.
1.11.1.5.7.4. Con: Hyper space can be disrupted by gravitational and mass shadows \(It's how Interdictor cruisers work in Star Wars\). As Warp Drives create a warp bubble that interacts with Mass, it is entirely plausible that the Federation could modify their warp engines and/or deflectors to turn every ship into an Interdictor, thus spoiling rebel ambushes and preventing them from escaping from any engagement.
1.11.1.5.7.5. Con: It works only if you change the question though. This asks who would win in space combat.
That is a tactical question
If you changed it to "Who would win in a space war \(or just a war\), then the strategic issue comes into play and this becomes a much more valid point, as it could be argued that the Federation would never reach the Rebel held worlds, resources and manufacturing Centres in any realistic timeframe.
1.11.1.5.7.5.1. Pro: Thus only the Rebellion would be able to launch any meaningful offences.

You'd end up with a situation where the Federation would \(probably\) win every Space Battle, but still not be able to win the war.
1.11.1.5.8. Con: Fast as the Rebels may be, their methods of propulsion face clear limitations that hamper their utility in battle and that the Federation does not have to deal with.
1.11.1.5.8.1. Pro: The Rebel Alliance ships use hyperspace drives, which rely on previously mapped hyperspace routes, and require calculation time to utilize. The United Federation of Planets is able to utilize warp drives, which allow for near instantaneous jump time and utility. Taking advantage of this imbalance in mobility, Federation ships would be able to use 'hit and run' techniques to outpace the Rebel Alliance in combat.
1.11.1.5.8.1.1. Con: This is demonstrably false. The Star Wars galaxy is 100,000 light years across, the exact same size as the Milky Way galaxy. Ships in Hyperspace are capable of traversing this entire distance in \(at most\) a matter of months. It was supposed to take the crew of the Voyager 75 years to make it back from 70,000 light years away. Star Wars ships are orders of magnitude faster than Star Trek ships.
1.11.1.5.8.1.2. Con: Warp speed is considerably slower than hyper speed so a hit and run tactic would not work as they could be intercepted or interdicted before being able to escape or during their escape.
1.11.1.5.8.1.2.1. Con: This is incorrect due to the time needed to calculate and initiate a hyperspace jump compared to going to warp. It is made worse by the speed of sensors and Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
1.11.1.5.8.1.3. Pro: Republic tech gets ships to a limited amount of places much faster. Federation ships could in 200 years colonize the half of the Galaxy that the Republic hasn't been able to map for 10,000 years. Much of the unmapped parts of the galaxy is likely hidden from the Humans-First republic, and since the Federation is about assimilation through agency rather than conquest and commerce, the Federation's principles would be capable of incorporating the galaxy's hidden species and civilizations.
1.11.1.5.8.1.4. Pro: Federation warp drives allow for much faster acceleration and braking \(as determined by the amount of time it takes the starts to stretch out\) and therefore have a tactical advantage over Rebel Alliance ships. They allow the Federation the illusion of being in multiple places at once.
1.11.1.5.8.2. Pro: While the Star Trek universe allow ships to move in interstellar space without limitations, ships in the Star Wars universe are forced to use carefully mapped [hyperspace routes](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperspace_route) to travel any significant distances. This gives the Federation a great mobility advantage.
1.11.1.5.8.2.1. Pro: Travels outside hyperspace routes are dangerous and limited to relatively short distances.
1.11.1.5.8.2.2. Pro: The mapping of hyperspace routes is a lengthy and complicated process; it takes years to chart any new region of space. In addition, hyperspace routes can easily blocked, for example by asteroids.
1.11.1.5.8.2.3. Pro: Depending on where the encounter with the Federation takes place, there is a possibility that the Rebels could not utilize their hyperdrives at all due to a lack of routes.
1.11.1.5.8.3. Pro: Hyperspace is only useful for fleet movements; Rebel ships are significantly slower in combat where that matters most.
1.11.1.5.8.4. Pro: Furthermore, a ship has to be stationary or moving in a straight line to plot a hyperspace jump. Large changes in direction can throw off the calculations and prove fatal to ships entering hyperspace.
1.11.1.5.8.5. Pro: There can be dangers involved in using [hyperspace travel](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperspace). If improperly calculated or done within a mass field, it can damage, cripple, or even destroy the ship. Hyperspace is therefore potentially damaging.
1.11.1.5.8.6. Pro: The Rebel's Hyperdrive does not allow for precision control and interaction with real space, whereas the Federation's Warp Drive does.
1.11.1.5.8.6.1. Con: Decisions made regarding where to depart/arrive when transiting hyperspace is being confused with actual capability. Often overlooked, there are plenty of instances where entire fleets of Star Wars vessels depart and arrive from hyperspace travel TOGETHER, in incredible close proximity to each other. This is only achievable with a mode of travel that allows for pinpoint accuracy when arriving at desired destinations. It also appears to be nothing out of the ordinary, a common ocurrance.
1.11.1.5.8.6.2. Pro: Federation sensors have frequently been shown to work while at warp speed, allowing them to detect and react while travelling at warp, as well as intercepting, evading, or even for use in battle \(such as the Picard manoeuvre\). They can also fire torpedoes while at warp, and even phasers that have been modified with an Annular Confinement Beam \(ACB\) jacketting. Objects in real space could be rammed at warp, or also cause an obstruction which shows physical interaction.
1.11.1.5.8.6.2.1. Pro: Federation ships are capable of micro-warp jumps while in battle, and to continue to track targets while doing so \(allowing them to fire, evade, and track targets, both to know where they are to fire and to avoid collisions.\).This is the basis for the Picard manoeuvre.
1.11.1.5.8.6.2.1.1. Pro: They rarely do so, as most Star Trek species' ships can also track objects moving at warp \(i.e. FTL\) and target them, so there is no tactical advantage to doing so. However, the Picard Manoeuvre used a flaw in obsolete sensors that didn't allow them to track FTL.
1.11.1.5.8.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: This temporarily prevents the enemy from targeting them, as well as creates sensor echos, or "ghosts" as the sensors would read more than one ship, both at it's original position and at its new position \(and with a longer jump, other places as well\), creating false images and targets. This can confuse the victim of the manoeuvre and cause problems with targeting and firing, creating an opening for the attacker to fire in the confusion.
1.11.1.5.8.6.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: This demonstrates the ability to use warp in battle, as well as prove that it has actual interaction with real space, and also provides examples of sensors working at FTL, both when travelling at it, or even for ships tracking FTL targets.
1.11.1.5.8.6.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: This would also put the Rebel Alliance in the same bracket as the Ferengi \(the people the manoeuvre was first used against\), as the Rebels do not have FTL sensors and tracking, meaning that warp has a tactical usage.
1.11.1.5.8.6.3. Pro: Conversely, Star Wars ships have frequently been demonstrated to be unable to detect what's on the other side of hyperspace, or detect ships travelling in hyperspace \(they can track them when they come out\). They cannot fire into or out of hyperspace. Objects in real space do not directly effect hyperspace \(rather mass shadows from real space do and can rip ships out of hyperspace or destroy them\).
1.11.1.5.8.6.4. Con: While a ship in hyperspace cannot directly effect the material universe, a ship entering or leaving hyperspace can ram a ship, or multiple ships, at extreme velocities in excess of what it would normally be able to achieve, as demonstrated in EPVIII.
1.11.1.5.8.6.4.1. Con: This is as fatal to the rammer as to its target, possibly more so in the case of a small, snub fighter.
1.11.1.5.8.6.5. Con: Hyperdrive emergence is extremely precise.  In The Force Awakens it was shown precise enough to insert the Falcon underneath a planetary shield.  While that maneuver was dangerous, it's also far in excess of what's needed to emerge right on top of an unsuspecting Federation vessel.
1.11.1.5.8.6.5.1. Con: And yet at other times it is shown they drop out of Hyperspace a good distance from a target, both due to gravity well distortions \(something the Force Awakens ignored\) and to avoid collisions. 

As they cannot read what is in real space while in hyperspace they have no way to know what they're dropping into \(see EpIV\), this shows a high level of imprecision.
1.11.1.5.8.6.5.1.1. Con: The Devastator emerged less than a kilometer from the Rebel fleet at the end of the battle of Scarif. The only other movie-level event existing is the Rebel attack on the second Death Star, and they emerged at a range to immediately create a perimeter with the cruisers per their plan; emerging right up in the Death Star's face wasn't necessary or desirable.
1.11.1.5.8.6.5.1.1.1. Con: [This indicates](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperdrive) that Hyper-jumps need careful planning to avoid collision and safe routes, along with precise co-ordinates and fore-knowledge to make "precise" jumps. That mass shadows do affect them.
1.11.1.5.8.6.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: This shows it's not routine
1.11.1.5.8.6.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: Furthermore, it shows the plot hole in Star Wars own use of their hyperdrives.

They are disrupted by mass shadows and pulled out of hyperspace or destroyed.

Yet Han is able to jump the Falcon right on top of Star Killer Base...an essentially Planet sized creation \(it even had atmosphere, climate and weather patterns\). At that size, it would have mass...and a mass shadow. His tactic should never have worked by their own tenuous science and continuity.
1.11.1.5.8.6.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Clearly he disengaged the safeties.  The mass shadow cutoff is a safety mechanism designed to prevent collisions, and can be overridden.
1.11.1.5.8.6.5.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Speculation only.

In fact, would be contradictory to the purpose of Interdictors, or his comments in Ep IV that there is a safety cut-off. Gravity shadows rip things out of hyperspace, and can even destroy them while doing so.

If there was an emergency cut off, Interdictors would become almost useless.
1.11.1.5.8.6.5.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Explain the Falcon's ability to emerge from hyperspace in atmosphere, or the U-wing's ability to enter hyperspace only a few hundred feet above ground level.
1.11.1.5.8.6.5.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con: [This](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperspace)would seem to indicate it is by no means standard practice, or common, and more a matter of luck then skill.
1.11.1.5.9. Con: Whilst Hyperdrive is substantially faster than warp, it has one major drawback, gravity wells, or interdiction. In Best of both worlds part II and scorpion part II it was shown that starfleet vessels could easily generate graviton beams from their main deflectors. As a graviton is a subatomic particle that transmits gravitational force, the federation could easily replicate the effects of Imperial Interdictors, essentially disabling Rebel hyperdrives.
1.11.1.5.10. Con: The Federation routinely fights at warp speed with faster-than-light phaser weapons. Tactics such as the Picard Maneuver exploit this fully. Conversely, Rebel ships fight at sub-light speeds and can only enter hyperspace for extensively calculated "jumps". Federation ships could sail around at a leisurely Warp 1 blasting away at targets of opportunity, easily outrunning any Rebel plasma bolts or torpedoes sent in reply.
1.11.1.5.10.1. Con: Phasers are not FTL weapons
1.11.1.5.11. Con: This is true only in a strategic sense. The Rebel hyperdrive is faster than the Federation warp technology on a strategic level, but has fewer tactical applications.
1.11.1.5.11.1. Con: -> See 1.11.1.5.2.
1.11.1.5.11.2. Pro: Both the Rebel Alliance and the Federation usually engage at velocities lower than light speed. At velocities lower than light-speed, Federation vessels enjoy a massive advantage and superiority at sub-light speeds.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1. Con: In '[A New Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_KUF_5Rkfc)', Rebel fighters transited the radius of Yavin, a gas giant roughly the size of Jupiter, in roughly twelve seconds, yielding a cruising speed of approximately 30,000,000 miles per hour.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.1. Con: In the first star trek movie Captain Kirk called for a sublight speed of warp point 5 or 1/2 the speed of light or 334,800,000 MPH
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.2. Con: The size of Yavin is never given. Assuming it to be the size of Jupiter is just an assumption. In fact It has been listed as [200,000km](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Yavin). Jupiter is Just shy of [140,000km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter) in diameter \(or 142,000 at the equator\). Thus Yavin is bigger to the point that it should be a Brown Dwarf, not a Gas Giant.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.2.1. Con: To the contrary, [Yavin](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Yavin) is 200,000 kilometers in diameter at the equator. The error is in comparing it to Jupiter, which has an equatorial diameter of 142,984 km.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3. Con: That is based on the time taken shown on screen, while ignoring several scene changes. It could also be a case of abuse of cinematic time \(A phenomenon where more or less time passes in a movie than the viewer is made aware of, relative to said viewer\). Nowhere is it stated it only took 12 seconds, nor is the camera following them the whole way. Thus the time cannot be gauged accurately as only 12 seconds.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.1. Pro: Additionally, it makes no sense that it would take Rebel fighters 12 seconds but the Death Star 30+ minutes to clear the same planet \(They state 30 minutes, but then there is time to formulate the plan, run the briefing, prep the ships and launch them, before the 30 minutes even starts, and the Death Star clock shows 32 minutes\).
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: It is further stated in the scene that the Death Star is orbiting the planet at maximum velocity and the base will be in range in [30 minutes](https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope). The scene then picks up with rebel fighters preparing to [launch/launching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WBG2rJZGW8&t=16s). It then cuts to the rebel command centre with the Death Star only 15 minutes away, in less than 3 minutes of footage. Then it cuts to Rebel fighters approaching the Death Star and starting their attack, by which point, the next count down is only 7 minutes away.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2. Pro: This is further supported by the fact the Death Star is [30 minutes away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WBG2rJZGW8), that there's a scene change to the fighters launching, then another to the Death Star being 15 minutes away, and then to the fighters approaching it, in the space of 3 minutes 40 seconds of screen time.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Even the battle abuses cinematic time. At the start of the battle, it is said they are 15 minutes away \(and a countdown shows 15 minutes and something odd seconds\). At the end it has cleared the planet and is ready to fire. The battle only lasts 12 minutes of screen time. Conclusively, 3 minutes were lost somewhere because it was done for cinematic time, not realism.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: [The Battle of Yavin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WBG2rJZGW8): 3:48 The Death Star claims to be 7 minutes away \(less than 5 minutes after being 15 minutes away\). Interestingly, the clock in the corner appears to be counting down in seconds from 20, not minutes.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2.2. Con: There are no cuts in the scene. Yavin 4 is in the background at the start of the shot, and the Death Star is visible at the end of the shot.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2.2.1. Con: Fighters take off from Yavin IV base, then it switches to the internal control room of Yavin IV saying that the Death Star will be in range in 15 minutes. It then cuts back to the fighter cockpits approaching the Death star.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: [Yavin IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_KUF_5Rkfc) is visible behind the X-wings at the start of the shot, and the Death Star is visible in front of them at the end of it, with no cuts.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The video referenced above is misleading. Based on the camera angle, they're not turning but flying straight, so they are not circulating Yavin, making it impossible to calculate their speed from that. It would also mean the Death Star has already cleared the planet \(the curvature is clearly not blocking it\) and Yavin IV is toast.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: They clearly are seen from a mobile camera angle; too much of Yavin's surface goes by in the background to be one hemisphere.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: They're shown [flying straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2iiQuGn-oM) during various cuts.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: If the X-wings were banking around the planet at that speed \(or using a gravitational sling shot to do so\) then Yavin IV behind them should fall behind the curvature of Yavin. It does not do so. It in fact pans off screen in the opposite direction, which shows it is the camera moving and not the X-Wings. Thus, they are clearly still flying in a straight line.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Even if the X-Wings were using a gravitational sling shot \(and the evidence does not support them doing so\) or gravity assist to achieve this speed, it would mean that their engines are not capable of producing such a speed on their own.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Yavin IV is in frame for 2 seconds. Given that this claim means they would have moved 60,000,000 miles from it in that time \(for reference, mean distance from Earth to moon is [384,400km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon)\), and that an objects perceived size is inversely proportional to the distance to it, Yavin should be almost invisible by the end of the time it is in scene. In fact, by the time it pans off camera, the size has not changed appreciably. Thus they have not travelled any significant distance from it.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.3. Con: "Abuse of cinematic time" is not an in-universe concept, and therefore an invalid rebuttal.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.3.1. Con: Based on the same logic, given that they can get from Deep Space 9 to Earth in less than a single episode \(run time 45 minutes\), then the Federation's maximum warp speed is in excess of 5000c an hour \(despite what Voyager says\) and dwarfs even the accomplishments of Star Wars. All because the passage of time wasn't referenced.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.3.3.1.1. Con: No 'Deep Space Nine' episode shows an uncut flight from the station to Earth.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.4. Con: An X-Wing travels at an atmospheric speed of [1,050 km/h](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/T-65B_X-wing_starfighter)\(higher speeds possible with deflector shields on\). It is rated for a maximum acceleration of [3,700 G](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/T-65_X-wing_starfighter)s or 16 MGLT/s \([Megalights per second](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Megalight)\) with a maximum speed of 100MGLT. It is put forward that speed measured in MGLT per hour is roughly equivalent to speed measured in meters per second. Therefore 1 MGLT/hour ≈ 100 meters/second, 360 kilometres/hour, and 223.694 miles per hour.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.4.1. Con: There's a cutscene in the X-wing game which shows the Death Star in range of Alderaan at roughly 3 megalights \(2.99\). Since Alderaan's "antigrav range" is 6 planetary diameters \(75000 km\) as the range which it opens fire - that would suggest that a megalight is around 25000 km, 1 MGLT is 25000 kph, and 100 MGLT \(X-wing and TIE fighter speed\) is 2.5 million kph. But these numbers are insanely fast so the reference above then disproves the claim using the same reference.
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.4.2. Con: This is of course a ridiculously slow speed, given that their atmospheric speed is faster and modern fighters are many times faster. It should also be noted that the ability to measure an MGLT comes from a game, a non-canon source. \(Though MGLT was used in canon production sources, no units were given for it\).
1.11.1.5.11.2.1.4.3. Con: Based on the 3700G's they should accelerate 38.2846km/s or 130624.578kph. With a max speed of 100MGLT or 360kph they would reach their maximum speed in 6.25-9.40 seconds. Thus these two figures do not work together, as the difference is more than 50%.
1.11.1.5.11.2.2. Pro: 90,000m/s is the max speed of an ion drive - The type of drive used by Imperial and Rebel ships in Star Wars vs. 3,747,405.725m/s which is the speed of a reaction or station keeping thruster used in Star Trek, or aprox. 0.0125c. Thus even if the Federation just used their reaction thrusters for Sublight travel and manoeuvring, they would enjoy a massive speed advantage over the Rebels on a scale of 41:1, or 41x faster \(well 41.6378, so I rounded down a little\)
1.11.1.5.11.2.2.1. Con: There is no evidence that Star Wars vessels use ion drives as currently built.
1.11.1.5.11.2.2.1.1. Con: To use your own logic: An Ion Drive is an Ion Drive
1.11.1.5.11.2.2.1.2. Con: All Canonical descriptions of [Ion Drives](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ion_engine) in Star Wars match what we know of how, and the [technical capabilities](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/Ion_Propulsion1.html) of [Ion Drives](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs21grc.html) in [our reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster).
1.11.1.5.11.2.3. Pro: Star Trek ships use Impulse Drive for sublight. Full impulse is 0.25c and it is suggested combat speed is between 0.72c and 0.95c, even accepting .25c as a maximum. That is just over 800x faster then the maximum theoretical possible of an [Ion drive](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/Ion_Propulsion1.html). It also allows them to turn on a dime and rotate fully around on the spot in less than 3 seconds. A feat no Star Wars capital ship can claim.
1.11.1.5.11.2.3.1. Pro: Additionally; C = speed of light \(299 792 458 m/s\). Meanwhile, the max speed of an [ION drive/engine](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/Ion_Propulsion1.html): 90,000 meters per second \(over 200,000 mph\) so .25c \(full Impulse\) = 74,948,114.5 m/s. 74948,114.5/90,000 = 832.756827 so at full impulse, Star Trek ships sublight speed, is more than 800 times faster than a TIE fighters, and thus presumably most Rebel fighters and Cap ships too.
1.11.1.5.11.2.4. Pro: TIE stands for Twin Ion Engine and Rebel Fighters are shown to be comparable sub-light speed to the Empires'. Thus it is likely that Ion Drives are the main propulsion for Fighters. Fighters are faster than capital ships. Medium and Capital ships appear to use fusion drives for real space manoeuvrability and travel. This is actually slightly slower than [Ion Engines](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/Ion_Propulsion1.html). Thus we can infer Star Wars capital ships are slower than their fighters.
1.11.1.5.11.2.4.1. Pro: Among Rebel Fighters, only the A-Wing has equal high-speed capability to the TIE Interceptor. Rebel fighters in general have lower top speed than the TIE dogfighters: [Maneuverability of Star Wars small craft](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/207028-wave-8-maneuver-guides/).
1.11.1.5.11.2.5. Pro: The targeting computers on the X-Wings and Y-Wings have been [confirmed to be](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Targeting_computer) in the equivalent of Meters. When Luke goes in at "[full throttle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WBG2rJZGW8&t=2s)" they are decreasing at [just over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuKqcfO31is&t=11s) a thousand a second, giving a rough max speed of 5400 kilometres per hour \(and this is very generous round up\), which is less than escape velocity. \(It also gives an indication of optimum, if not maximum, firing and targeting range for Lasers and Torpedoes in Star Wars\)
1.11.1.5.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.5.8.6.
1.11.1.6. Pro: The Federation's shields are vastly superior to those of the Rebel Alliance.
1.11.1.6.1. Pro: Star Wars has 2 or 3 shield types: ray shields, particle shields \(and possibly deflectors\). Stated in EpIV. They clearly all have different functions and seem to interfere with each other \(hence why the exhaust port on the Death Star was only ray shielded\). Their deflector generators are often outside the shields \(the sensor domes on ISD's appear to be shield gens on SSD's - From Ep VI\). This makes them easy targets.
1.11.1.6.1.1. Con: Although Star Wars weapons are referred to as lasers \(laser cannons on TIE's and X-Wings etc. and turbolasers on capital ships\), they are not actually laser weapons. Visually and from the technical specs of how they work, they are actually plasma weapons. And plasma weapons have been shown to be effective.
1.11.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Even if they were lasers, there is no upper limit on how powerful a laser can be, and they could be substantially more powerful then Star Trek Lasers and thus still be effective, especially in mass numbers.
1.11.1.6.1.1.2. Con: This would mean if Star Wars weapons are laser based, they would be highly ineffective against Federation Navigational Deflectors, Shields and Hull.
If they are plasma based, they will also be ineffective against Federation hulls due to the significant thermal resistance possessed by Federation hulls.
1.11.1.6.1.1.2.1. Pro: Plasma weapons deal most of their damage thermally, with some EM and very little kinetic impact.
Particle weapons do a good mix of EM, kinetic and thermal damage.
Lasers do mostly thermal, followed by EM with very little kinetic.
1.11.1.6.1.2. Con: Rebel ships shield projectors are generally not outside the shields. While it is true Starfleet boost superior targeting ability and accuracy and make spin-point called shots, which would be effective against the Empire to quickly knock down their shields, such a tactic would be ineffective against the Rebellion.
1.11.1.6.1.3. Con: The exhaust port on the Death Star was only ray shielded because it's an exhaust port, and to prevent matter from leaving would defeat its purpose. There is no indication that shield types interfere with each other.
1.11.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: If it was an exhaust port for energy emissions, it would vent plasma, super-heated ionised gas \(same things turbolasers are\). If for Ion drive, it would emit ionised particles. So the same as above. So it would make particle shields pointless, and even counter productive on it.
1.11.1.6.1.3.1.1. Con: Given that this proves the point that turbolasers \(and most other so called lasers and blasters in star wars\) are plasma, they would ignore ray shields anyway, making ray shields pointless.
1.11.1.6.1.4. Pro: Star Wars ray shields appear to be magnetically based \(based on visual evidence, speech, inference, science and logic\). They can either deflect shots, force their magnetic envelope to burst prematurely \(thus reducing the effectiveness\) of the shot, and some \(may\) have some limited energy absorption capabilities.
1.11.1.6.1.4.1. Con: Some \(though based on visual evidence, not all\) may also have some limited effect on physical objects, but this is by no means certain and many is appears possible to walk through \(again, plenty of examples and visual evidence\).
1.11.1.6.1.4.1.1. Con: There are many examples of them absorbing energy and being strong enough to defeat any bombardment or attack, as well as being deadly to biological lifeforms.
1.11.1.6.1.4.1.2. Pro: They appear to extend some distance from the craft, like Star Trek shields. This could just be magnetic field effects, but on screen evidence would seem to indicate otherwise.
1.11.1.6.1.4.2. Con: Purely magnetic shields would not deflect or absorb radiation as these are supposed to do.
1.11.1.6.1.4.3. Pro: Based on this evidence, they would be quite, or mostly, ineffective against Star Trek weapons, which do not rely on magnetic fields and are particle based.
1.11.1.6.1.4.3.1. Con: They may have an effect on the magnetic containment in a photon torpedo \(though not on the torpedo/projectile itself\).
1.11.1.6.1.4.3.1.1. Con: This is provided they have time to have an effect on it. Given the speed torpedoes travel at, this is an uncertainty and may be unlikely.
1.11.1.6.1.5. Pro: Star Wars particle shields appear to work by disintegrating physical matter that contacts them, as well as absorbing some of the energy of the impact and later radiating it away. Unlike ray shields, they appear to be skin tight \(against the hull of the vessel\) and have no effect on pure energy.
1.11.1.6.1.5.1. Pro: Torpedoes could affect the ship through shields in the same way that the asteroids do. This would deal incredible damage to the Rebel ships
1.11.1.6.1.5.2. Con: They appear to have a size limit, or else an energy limit however, as it is frequently shown them being overwhelmed \(asteroid impacts, physical collisions etc\). The fact the Falcon could attach to a Star Destroyer without being destroyed would also support this.
1.11.1.6.1.5.2.1. Con: It could just be the case that the shields were not operational at the time
1.11.1.6.1.5.3. Pro: If this is true, they could be highly effective against Federation phasers, dependent on their energy absorption capabilities. Their efficiency against photon torpedoes would be questionable however due to the observable evidence indicating they can be passed through or overwhelmed.
1.11.1.6.1.5.4. Con: Due to their proximity against the hull, they do not appear to be entirely effective and some amount of the damage, force or impact appears to seep through and cause damage, if just by kinetic shock and vibration and rupturing or overload of power conduits. Against high impact or high energy attacks, this damage could build up fast and overwhelm them.
1.11.1.6.2. Pro: Star Wars shields collapse after only a few "laser" \(actually plasma\) hits. This is seen when X-Wings \(and other Rebel fighters\) are destroyed by a single shot from TIE Fighters in both the 'Battle of Yavin' and the 'Battle of Endor'.
1.11.1.6.2.1. Con: On the other hand, no Rebel cruisers are shown lost apart from to the second Death Star at Endor, speaking to considerable capital ship shield endurance.
1.11.1.6.2.1.1. Con: No Rebel cap ships are, but plenty of Imperial ones are, including the SSD Executor, the ISDII Devastator and several other unnamed ISD and ISDII's. 

As Imperial Ships are said to be better equipped, tougher and more durable and more formidable than Rebel capital ships, this does not really support the claim of capital ship endurance.
1.11.1.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: Canon sources state 1 SSD, 1 Battlecruiser and at least 3 ISD/ISDII's.

Legend sources agree with the SSD and Battlecruiser, and put the Star Destroyer casualties between 12 and 27.
1.11.1.6.2.2. Pro: On the other hand, no Rebel cruisers are shown lost apart from to the second Death star at Endor, speaking to considerably underpowered capital ship weaponry.
1.11.1.6.2.2.1. Con: [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZigWFyK2o#t=6m20s)  That's really all that needs said to that.
1.11.1.6.3. Pro: Star Trek has both Navigational Deflector Shields and fully powered Protective Deflector Shields \(which actually absorb impact\). It is stated several times in ST:TNG, in multiple episodes that most lasers cannot harm or get past the Navigational Deflectors and could fire at them all day and not inflict damage on a Galaxy Class starship. Ships with lasers, even in multiples \(often 3-5\) are not considered a threat or a match for a Galaxy Class starship.
1.11.1.6.3.1. Pro: Star Trek shields can withstand being in the corona of a star for a short time and tank Thermonuclear warheads from 100m away \(ST:ToS: Balance of Terror\), as well as withstand multiple torpedo impacts \(see separate discussion on power of photon torpedoes and kinetic impact.\)
1.11.1.6.3.2. Con: This is a ridiculous no-limits argument.  A laser with sufficient power behind it, such as that used by the Borg cube in TNG Season 2, Episode 16, "Q Who?," is capable of threatening Federation vessels.
1.11.1.6.3.2.1. Con: This claim is factually false: the Borg do not use lasers. Their beam weapon is often called a cutting beam, but that does not imply laser-based technology. Rebel weapons, however, are explicitly referred to as lasers.
1.11.1.6.3.2.2. Con: The power of a laser is irrelevant--the technology itself, as per Trek canon, cannot cause harm to a Federation vessel. One potential explanation is: the only thing needed to stop any laser is refraction, and it's reasonable to think navigational deflectors accomplish this.
1.11.1.6.3.3. Pro: There are numerous laser users in Star Trek the next generation, including the Atlec \(TNG: "The Outrageous Okona"\), the Borg \(TNG: "Q Who"\), the Lysian Alliance \(TNG: "Conundrum"\), the Solari \(TNG: "Loud As A Whisper"\), the Straleb \(TNG: "The Outrageous Okona"\), and the Talarians \(TNG: "Suddenly Human"\). Of these, only 1 is considered a threat, and even that was after the shields were down, at which point it was shown to be in that episode and others, extremely devastating.
1.11.1.6.3.3.1. Pro: Starfleet Regulations called for a Federation starship to go to yellow alert when targeted by laser weapons from another vessel. In 2365, USS Enterprise-D captain Jean-Luc Picard thought the rule was outdated, since the laser weapons of an Atlec vessel were incapable of even penetrating the navigational deflectors. Picard also noted that Atlecs could fire until their lasers ran dry and they still wouldn't have caused any damage to the Enterprise. [\(TNG: "The Outrageous Okona"\)](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Laser_weapon)
1.11.1.6.3.3.1.1. Pro: later episodes in The Next Generation seemed to indicate that the laser's use as a weapon was outdated. In one instance, the ship-mounted lasers of two spacecraft were incapable of overcoming even the navigational shields of the USS Enterprise-D
1.11.1.6.3.3.1.2. Pro: In\(TNG: "The Outrageous Okona: In 2365, the Class 9 cargo vessel Erstwhile was armed with a 2.3 megawatt laser array with four emitters. 

This was also not considered to be a match, or even a threat to the Enterprise and would be completely incapable of hurting it.
1.11.1.6.3.3.2. Pro: The Borg cutter weapon is a laser, as mentioned in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "Q Who" and is apparently incapable of directly penetrating Federation shielding. \(Although it is effective at making 'surgical' incisions into a ship's hull.\)
1.11.1.6.3.3.3. Pro: According to Lt. Sulu in 2269, the laser weapons the Federation possessed were a more advanced model than the laser setting of the Slaver weapon, and their laser had been more powerful for the last century. \(The Animated Series: "The Slaver Weapon"\). Thus showing that even by the time of The Original Series, lasers were considered inferior and not a real threat anymore.
1.11.1.6.3.3.3.1. Con: The Animated Series is not concretely accepted as [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Animated_Series#Canon_issues); its status is highly debatable.
1.11.1.6.3.3.4. Con: The 24th century Federation belief that lasers were obsolete weapons was proved wrong in a catastrophic fashion on the Federation's first contact with the Borg, as the cutting beam aboard a Borg cube proved to be capable of destroying Federation starships with ease. \(TNG: "Q Who", "The Best of Both Worlds"; DS9: "Emissary"; Star Trek: First Contact\)
1.11.1.6.3.3.5. Pro: Pulse lasers were used as weapons by the Lysian Central Command. Like other laser devices, pulse lasers were not considered very powerful by 24th century Federation standards. \(TNG: "Conundrum"\)
1.11.1.6.3.3.6. Pro: Commander Data informs Picard that the Lysian command center is virtually defenseless with over fifteen thousand people aboard. One photon torpedo could destroy the entire structure, while its entire arsenal could not even damage Enterprise and Riker poses the question: How could the Federation's mortal enemy be over a hundred years behind it in weapons technology.
1.11.1.6.3.3.6.1. Pro: From TNG: Conundrum PICARD: Tactical analysis, Mister Data. DATA: The pods are equipped with fusion-generated pulse lasers and minimal shielding. RIKER: Not much power there. PICARD: Forward shields to maximum. Lock phasers on the sentry pods. Prepare to return fire. WORF: Shields up. Phasers locked on targets.
1.11.1.6.3.3.6.2. Pro: Also from Conundrum: PICARD: "What are the defensive capabilities of the Central Command?". DATA: "Armaments consist of four laser cannons and thirty nine cobalt fusion warheads with magnetic propulsion. Defensive shield output is four point three kilojoules.". "RIKER: One photon torpedo ought to do it."
1.11.1.6.3.3.7. Pro: During The Next Generation episode: "Suddenly Human", Picard discusses with Data regarding power of their power in relation to their opponents: Picard: "Mister Data, what's their offensive potential? " . Data: "Talarian warships are limited to neutral particle weapons, high energy X-ray lasers and merculite rockets. No match for the Enterprise, Captain." . Picard: "The last thing I want is to be forced into destroying one of their ships.".
1.11.1.6.3.3.7.1. Pro: Even three such vessels were not considered a match or a threat for a single Galaxy Class Starship
1.11.1.6.3.3.8. Pro: A laser pulse system was a modification that allows a laser beam to be fired through a starship's weapons array. This modification to a starship's weapons system allowed for simulated phaser and photon torpedo operation and performance, but with no potential for actual damage. The system was used to record hits in Starfleet battle simulations without risking damage to the ships involved.
1.11.1.6.3.3.8.1. Con: Clearly the Federation would not use weapons-grade lasers to record hits in a simulation.
1.11.1.6.4. Pro: Depending on the Rebel shield technology they'll suffer from two issues, either a rotating shield frequency like that which the federation uses of which stops enemies modulating your weapons to your shields but has the problem that transporters can be used through it \(following Chief O'Brien's method\) or they use a continual frequency of which can be modulated to and made pointless
1.11.1.6.5. Pro: Starfleet shields are also backed up by Ablative Armor.
1.11.1.6.6. Pro: Starfleet shields are stronger because antimatter power generation allows for a greater shield energy reserve than Rebel ships can use with just fusion.
1.11.1.6.7. Pro: Starfleet has access to regenerative force fields like those found on The NX Prometheus, which are a massive step forward over existing shields. These are also demonstrated by one of their opponents in Star Trek Nemesis.
1.11.1.6.8. Pro: Star Trek has access to metaphasic shield technology, developed by the Ferengi scientist Doctor Reyga \(TNG: Suspicions\). They used this to hide in the corona of a star for over an hour. \(TNG: Decent Part II\). As the corona of a star is mostly plasma, and turbolasers are plasma weapons, it stands to reason that metaphasic shielded ships could withstand bombardment from them for at least an hour, if not several.
1.11.1.6.9. Pro: Federation could probably beam through Rebel shields. Star Wars shields seem a lot more patchwork than Star Trek shields, what with all the talk of forward and rear deflectors. It only takes the smallest imperfection in a shield for it to be vulnerable to beaming.
1.11.1.6.10. Con: The Rebel Alliance has ion cannon technology. This renders the electrical systems of an enemy ship inoperable. The energy shields of Starfleet vessels would collapse.
1.11.1.6.10.1. Con: Starfleet vessels are shielded against Ion and EMP damage due to the fact that any solar flare or similar they encountered would otherwise fry the ships circuits.
1.11.1.6.10.1.1. Pro: Further evidence: Balance of Terror. A Thermonuclear device detonates at 100m away \(they create EMP waves\). It overloads a few circuits due to the EMP, but not enough to disable the ship in any meaningful way, while also causing no physical damage due to the shields.
1.11.1.6.10.1.2. Con: Star Wars vessels similarly must contend with solar flares and similar, and fall prey to ion cannons all the same. Starfleet vessels cannot be very well hardened against electrical surges, since hits anywhere on the ship blow out control panels on the bridge.
1.11.1.6.10.1.2.1. Con: Star Wars vessels though do not appear to be shielded in this way. In the [rebels comic](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Learning_Patience) \(considered canon\) the Ghost is struck by an ion storm and rendered inoperative, the crew have to repair the ship to get the weapons and engines back on-line. soft cannon compares ion storms to ion cannons.
1.11.1.6.10.1.2.1.1. Con: We know nothing about the intensity of this ion storm. Captain Syndulla clearly didn't expect to be disabled, or she would not have attempted to use the storm to evade pursuit. At any rate, losing ships to ion storms and solar flares does not appear to be a routine occurrence.
1.11.1.6.10.1.2.1.1.1. Con: It is not a routine occurrence because we see exactly one example of a ship trying to pass through an Ion storm. Captain Syndulla was fully aware of the risks should she fail, but they were preferable to a guaranteed destruction at the hands of the Empire.
1.11.1.6.10.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Whilst it is true that we no nothing of the intensity of the storm, Hera clearly does expect the possibility of damage to the ship as she cautions the crew to [buckle up](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/rebelsscreens.tumblr.com/post/115040329619/part-1-of-learning-patience-the-new-comic-from/amp) and says that they have no way of knowing how it will effect the ship. This alone suggests that Star Wars ships don’t react well to Ion storms.
1.11.1.6.10.2. Con: Due to the [EPS Grid](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/EPS_grid), power overloads are unable to affect Starfleet vessels
1.11.1.6.10.3. Con: Star fleet have been able to beat other energy damping weapons with it's science/engineering departments.
1.11.1.6.10.3.1. Pro: A good example of this would be the Breen Energy Dissipator, which functions similarly to an Ion Cannon. The Federation were able to overcome this.
1.11.1.6.10.3.2. Con: The [ion cannon](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ion_cannon/Legends) is more like an EMP than an energy depleting weapon. It works by wreaking electronic havoc. While the hull of the ship remains intact, and the crew can repair affected systems, Starfleet reliance on shielding over armor would be a serious liability during the repairs.
1.11.1.6.10.3.2.1. Pro: From the [TNG Tech Manual](http://xaeyr.typepad.com/files/franchise-star-trek-tng-technical-manual1.pdf), \(p.22-23\), dubious canonicty: \(several figures quoted at [www.trekbbs.com](https://www.trekbbs.com/threads/enterprise-d-hull-question.209788/)\) =39.67 cm or 15.6 inches around major structural elements and about 30.47 cm or 11.99 inches at most of the hull. This does seem very thin for a space vessel and would support low armour/hull claims.
1.11.1.6.10.3.2.1.1. Con: However, other sources and episodes quote:
"Standard Duranium/Tritanium Double hull plus 9 cm High density armour.". It is also stated that the inner and outer hulls are 4m-8m thick, which some people interpret as 16m for the two \(all 3 numbers however are debatable as it can clearly be seen that the hull is no where near this thick in Best of Both Worlds, and any shot with a window.\).
1.11.1.6.10.3.2.2. Con: The description of the Ion Cannon appears to rely on it impacting a hull in the first place, while Star Trek's shields appear to exist quite a fair distance from the body of the ship itself. Since the shields are more than capable of dispersing other particle-based attacks, the ion cannon should not be any different.
1.11.1.6.10.4. Con: Ion cannons [have appeared](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Phased_ion_cannon) in Star Trek, too, and could likely be acquired by Starfleet if necessary.
1.11.1.6.11. Pro: We see in the Episode "Civil Defence" that the Shields on Deep Space 9 are capable of taking the entire output of the stations fusion reactors overloading, a blast that should be big enough to destroy the entire station instantly, and the shields absorb it no problem, with no additional damage to the Station.
1.11.1.6.11.1. Pro: To clarify, that means Federation shields are MORE THAN 100% efficient, as they can easily and effortlessly absorb more energy then it takes to power them.
1.11.1.6.12. Pro: It's not known how strong Star Trek combat shields are, but they must, logically, be more powerful than their navigational deflectors \(also a form of shield\). One can calculate the absolute minimum strength of the navigational deflector on most Star Fleet vessels, and can assume the main combat shields would be several times this.
1.11.1.6.12.1. Pro: Although based on their name, many would assume that "deflectors" use "graviton particles" to deflect incoming objects so they do not strike the ship \(a reasonable assumption\), it's known from Worf/Riker/Picard et al. in several different episodes of the 'Next Generation' that lasers and certain missiles would fail to penetrate their navigational deflectors. This conclusively demonstrates that they have an absorption capacity as well, logically in case they failed to deflect an object enough.
1.11.1.6.12.1.1. Pro: The navigational deflector must be able to absorb the impact of a piece of debris at several times the speed of light in the case they can't deflect it, otherwise Federation ships would explode with alarming regularity while at warp speeds. There are still a lot of variables to consider but there are enough known factors to calculate an absolute minimum value for the navigational deflectors.
1.11.1.6.12.1.1.1. Pro: Using the Intrepid class as a baseline, it's know that it has a maximum sustainable warp speed of warp 9.6, around 1000c  \(It can actually go faster than this at [warp 9.975](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Maximum_warp), which is about 4000c - but for the purpose of this the sustainable speed is used\). It is not known what mass it is designed to repel, so it's necessary to use a minimum value of 1kg \(it is very likely higher, ranges of 5kg-150kg, the size of a large human, would not be unlikely\).
1.11.1.6.12.1.1.1.1. Pro: If one was to use a larger value, the result would be many times higher. It is not known what the density or frequency of such objects in space is. Given a speed of 1000c and a very minimal safety margin, the ability to absorb or deflect 1 such impact a second would be a good estimate. This could be higher or lower, and would likely be greater as a safety margin/precaution, but will go with a low end estimate of 1 per second.
1.11.1.6.12.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Liberties have been taken with figures to round down and give a lower result in order to provide more marginal. It's also assumed that the object in the ships path is stationary. If it is moving, its direction and speed can change the calculations dramatically but: 1kg impact at 1000c = 1.0740e+7 MgT / second, or  4.4938e+22 joules / second. This is a minimum for the navigational deflector. The real value is likely to be higher. The combat shields would be higher still.
1.11.1.6.12.1.1.2. Con: The navigational deflector performed its primary function by emitting low-power deflector shields to deflect microscopic particles and higher-powered deflector beams and/or tractor beams to deflect larger objects \(Star Trek: First Contact; VOY: "Alliances", "Shattered"\).
1.11.1.6.12.1.1.2.1. Con: The low power is questionable however, as in 'First Contact' Picard tells Worf to not shoot the deflector dish as it's "charged with anti-protons" because it will "destroy half the ship".
1.11.1.6.12.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Similar damage to the [Enterprise-B](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/426786502162793689) and the [Odyssey](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Jem%27Hadar_\(episode\)) did not destroy half the ship \(The Odyssey was actually destroyed by the debris that spun off and struck the Nacelle\). Picard may have been being hyperbolic.
1.11.1.6.12.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Additionally, the navigational deflector was said to be the only thing able to channel large amounts of energy. This was seen in '[Best of Both Worlds](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Navigational_deflector)' and 'Night Terrors'.
1.11.1.7. Pro: The Federation's sensors are vastly superior to those of the Rebel Alliance.
1.11.1.7.1. Con: In Star Trek, sensors \(especially transporter sensors\) have countless ways to be blocked or jammed, significantly reducing this advantage.
1.11.1.7.1.1. Con: Its only rare and dense metals that block transporters and certain atmospherics which block sensors - and in some case shielding
1.11.1.7.1.2. Pro: You cannot transport through shields
1.11.1.7.2. Pro: The Federation have something, that Empire never have - scanners, capable of detecting ships at FTL speed. Basically, Federation have interstellar-range radars, which allow them to control movements of all non-cloacked ships on parsecs range. Any possible Alliance attack could not be sudden or unexpected, and it would be impossible for Alliance to retreat safely - Federation starships would follow them everywhere.
1.11.1.7.2.1. Pro: The [Star Trek technical manual](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nOJAc.png) clearly stated, that even in 2260s, Federation already have [sensors](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Long_range_sensor_scan) with at least 17 lightyears range.
1.11.1.7.3. Pro: Star Trek has sensors capable of pin-pointing an individual or even reading their DNA and genetic makeup, from orbit \(essentially how transporters work\), register the exact number, and co-ordinate for each. It also allows their weapons to make precision shots and target individual components with no collateral damage. Star Trek's long range sensors scan other sectors up to 20ly away.
1.11.1.7.4. Pro: Star Wars ships have trouble identifying droids or pin-pointing life forms \(can only tell if they're there or not\) and can barely tell if shields are up or down. They are reliant on probes for long range scanning and can only just detect things in the same system, as seen in both EpIV and EpV.
1.11.1.8. Con: Tactics over technology has historically been the deciding factor in battle. The Federation has rarely showed itself to posses any strategic thinkers or battle planners.
1.11.1.8.1. Con: The Federation has tacticians and strategists such as Garth of Izar, James.T.Kirk, Jean Luc Picard, William Riker, Edward Jellico, Benjamin Sisko, William Ross, Elizabeth Shellby, Alynna Nechayev, Admiral Hayes and others. All of whom shows significant tactical and strategic thinking.
1.11.1.8.2. Con: Technology and tactics both play an important role--the most tactical ancient archer will never win against a drone strike. Discounting technological advantage is in itself a tactical error.
1.11.1.8.2.1. Con: The technologies of Star Wars and Star Trek are far more comparable than an archer and a UAV, meaning that the importance of tactics is in fact paramount.
1.11.1.8.2.1.1. Con: This is not entirely accurate. In many ways it is comparing WW1 and WW2 technology with Modern Technology, and that's being generous.
1.11.1.9. Pro: Federation vessels enjoy a massive advantage and superiority at sub-light speeds.
1.11.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.5.8.1.
1.11.1.11. Pro: The Federation has [time travel capabilities](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Time_travel).
1.11.1.11.1. Con: Due to the Temporal Prime Directive, the federation is not likely to use them. Case in point: Even at the worst points of of the Dominion War, the Federation does not go back to alter the timeline and undo crushing defeats or massive casualties.
1.11.1.12. Pro: The Federation uses antimatter power generation, while the Rebel Alliance is powered by fusion. This is a massive difference in power output that would be of benefit to shields, weapons, and other supporting devices.
1.11.1.13. Con: Almost every single instance of Starfleet technology being used, it is absolutely reliant on [subspace](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Subspace), which has been proven to be [capable](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Omega_Directive) of being ruptured or destroyed.
1.11.1.13.1. Con: There is no evidence the Rebels would be able to rupture, disrupt or Destroy Subspace
1.11.1.13.1.1. Pro: Because the Rebels don't use subspace, they would need extensive research on what it is and how it works before they could even begin to imagine ways of disrupting it.
1.11.1.14. Con: Rebel spies stole the plans for the Death Star and could likewise steal plans for any technology and duplicate it for themselves.
1.11.1.14.1. Con: This assumes they could understand the technology to duplicate it. A caveman could steal the blueprints of an auto-mobile, it doesn't mean they could understand how to build one even with the blueprints.
1.11.1.14.1.1. Pro: Their use requires advanced scanning technologies to understand the molecular makeup of an object; technology the Rebels haven't demonstrated knowledge of. The device is useless without a detailed understanding of the object they intend to replicate.
1.11.1.14.1.2. Pro: Replicators are more than just hardware; they require sophisticated software to work, which can include [locks on various substances](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Replicator). These same software components can disable replicators as well, making them tougher to reverse-engineer.
1.11.1.14.1.2.1. Pro: Voyager provides an excellent example of what can go wrong when a race gets hold of a technology \(specifically replicators\) it doesn't truly understand. The results are catastrophic for the would be thieves.
1.11.1.14.1.3. Pro: If they could figure out how to make it work, and even if they could use Federation databases, there's no evidence that the alloys would work with their design principles--Starfleet ships make use of materials designed to operate within structural integrity fields, which could result in the material's collapse at the building sizes employed by Rebel vessels.
1.11.1.14.2. Con: Starfleet and the Empire have different military cultures and different anti-espionage techniques and technologies. That it worked against the Empire doesn't imply it would work against the Federation.
1.11.1.14.3. Con: Rebels are citizens of the Empire, potentially allowing them access to positions of responsibility and influence; they could access information without immediately causing suspicion. They would be at an extreme disadvantage against the Federation where they would appear to be immigrants from an enemy combatant, warranting greater scrutiny.
1.11.1.15. Pro: Starfleet has [cloaked, self-replicating mines](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Self-replicating_mine) that could defend key assets. This could be especially disastrous to the Rebels if they make a hyperspace jump into the unseen minefield.
1.11.1.16. Con: The Rebel Alliance's fighter craft are technologically superior to the Federations little selection of fighter craft, overcoming them in size ratio, speed/acceleration, and weapon systems.
1.11.1.16.1. Pro: Rebel fighter craft are also capable of harrying, crippling, and outright destroying enemy capital ships on their own.
1.11.1.17. Pro: The Federation ships are designed to fight [while moving at warp speed](http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/inconsistencies/treknology-weapons.htm) and engage stationary objects from warp. The Rebels ships are designed only to fight at slower-than-light speed.
1.11.1.17.1. Pro: Federation ships therefore could close in on Rebel ships at faster-than-light velocity, hit them, and retreat before rebels would even be able to see them \(due to Federation ships traveling at warp speed, faster than light\).
1.11.1.18. Pro: Unlike Star Wars canon, Federation ships are able to alter the parameters of both offensive and defensive equipment on the fly. They would be able to tune their shields to be more effective protection from turbolasers. They would also be able to modify the frequency, firing rate, and beam width to better cut through the rebel ships' shields and armor. Beyond that, there are several examples of federation ships being able to target critical systems such as weapons or engines.
1.11.1.19. Con: Every Alliance fighter is equipped with its own hyperdrive. It is possible for the [Alliance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCVWm20fU0A) to deploy to a sector already in attack formation, allowing for surgical strikes with the intention of overwhelming the enemy before he can scramble a defense, and then escaping before reinforcements can arrive.
1.11.1.19.1. Pro: [Starfleet ships](http://www.stardestroyer.net/wiki/index.php?title=ST_Shields) rely on directional shielding, rather than the full-ship shielding of [Alliance vessels](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Deflector_shield). An overwhelming attack from a flanking position could potentially devastate Starfleet vessels before they even had time to lock on target.
1.11.1.19.1.1. Con: Directional shielding doesn't quite describe it--it's a [grid](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Deflector_shield), and a failure could be compensated for by extending the shields of another section. Reinforcement is also possibly simply by diverting more power. This assumes it would even be necessary against the low-tech weapons employed by the Rebels.
1.11.1.19.1.1.1. Pro: Specifically, most ships have multiple shield projectors covering numerous arcs. One being down doesn't stop others \(See Star Trek Nemesis\). At other times, they have a full ship shields \(See Star Trek 2\). Never are they seen as single directional at a time.
1.11.1.19.1.2. Con: Starfleet ships are very nimble, and move much like a fighter would. They could easily avoid a flanking position, or rotate to prevent damage to the area being attacked.
1.11.1.19.2. Pro: Hyperdrive cores can generate speeds up to [1,000 times faster](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/34994/is-a-warp-drive-faster-than-a-hyperdrive) than the warp drives of the most advanced Starfleet vessels.
1.11.1.19.3. Con: -> See 1.11.1.5.8.
1.11.1.19.4. Con: This is only true if they actually have coordinates and planned hyperspace routes. Therefore, while this advantage would certainly exist in a "Galaxy Far Far Away", it's unlikely to benefit them should the fight take place in the Milky Way galaxy.
1.11.1.20. Pro: The Federation has access to superior weaponry.
1.11.1.20.1. Pro: A Constitution Class Starship from Kirk's era could enact General Order 24 - An order to destroy all life on an entire planet. Thus, the weapons on one single such a vessel must be sufficient to accomplish this, on its own.
1.11.1.20.1.1. Pro: This shows a single Constitution Class Starship from Kirk's era can effectively sterilise a planet of all life, scour the surface, or even destroy the planetary surface and crack the crust and disrupt the mantle, on its own, without fleet support. Additionally there's the ships from the Next Generation/Deep Space 9/Voyager era over 100 years late, with significant power and technological advancement.
1.11.1.20.1.2. Pro: This order has been given by Captain Garth on Antos IV \("Whom Gods Destroy"\) though his crew refused to carry it out.
1.11.1.20.1.3. Pro: Captain Kirk called for this General Order on Eminiar VII \("A Taste of Armageddon"\) . It was also hinted at in two or three other original series episodes, including "Mirror, Mirror" and "operation Annihilate!".
1.11.1.20.2. Pro: The Federation has a wider array of tools available.
1.11.1.20.2.1. Pro: The weapons in Star Trek cannot only be used as weapons but also as tools to remove rubble or debris.
1.11.1.20.2.2. Pro: Phasers can cauterise wounds, giving them a medical application.
1.11.1.20.2.3. Pro: Phasers can be used for the cutting and welding of metals; in this way they can be used to seal doors or open them.
1.11.1.20.2.4. Pro: Phasers have been shown to have even more unusual 'non damaging' effects of which can be used to [dispel cloaking technology](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Dispersion_frequency) or potentially interfere with electronics
1.11.1.20.3. Pro: Star trek ships weapons fire in all directions in a 360 degree arc. Their ships are smaller but they can attack any direction regardless of ship facing. Star wars ships are much larger such as the Imperial Star Destroyer at 1600 meters, but the weapons in star wars are point direct weapons like old school naval vessels.
1.11.1.20.3.1. Pro: The weapons on the left of an Imperial Star Destroyer, can't fire at targets on the right side and vice versa, and can't fire at all behind. Rebels ships require positioning, Federation ships are adaptive.
1.11.1.20.3.1.1. Pro: Although Star Destroyers do have the ability to fire well at the target they're facing due to their sloped nature it would mean the agility and manoeuvrability of Federation vessels would still be a technological downfall.
1.11.1.20.3.1.2. Pro: Mon Calamari cruisers probably suffer from the same issue as their weapons are per side whereas in StarTrek you can clearly see that most Federation vessels have firing arcs that intersect with eachother so that they may fire all weapons at once
1.11.1.20.4. Pro: A single Federation Starship can reliably scour the surface of a planet and sterilise it of all life \(see General Order 24, in several episodes of the Original Series\). Their weapons are capable of cracking the crust and disrupting the mantle. They have no need of a ground attack. This is more than any single capital ship in Star Wars is capable of, showing marked superiority in weapons power to even older and smaller Federation vessels.
1.11.1.20.4.1. Pro: Th closest that Star Wars has is Base Delta Zero, an Imperial code for as the code for an Imperial military initiative used to cause widespread devastation on a planet, in an attempt to completely exterminate a planet's population. The key word is attempt. Shields could prevent even fleets from achieving this and necessitated such devices as the Death Star.
1.11.1.20.5. Pro: The Federation has a wide variety of projectile \([torpedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_in_Star_Trek)\) weapons at it's disposal, far greater than those in Star Wars.
1.11.1.20.5.1. Con: Star Wars space ships have lots of laser guns that would destroy any approaching projectiles.
1.11.1.20.5.1.1. Con: Most Star Wars fans suggest that Star Wars weapons are not lasers, but plasma based. This is further borne out by most expanded universe sources which describe their workings as quite clearly plasma weapons. Plasma weapons are much slower than laser weapons and therefore much less capable of intercepting projectiles.
1.11.1.20.5.1.2. Con: This is assuming they can target said projectiles. The Rebels and the Empire have been shown to be unable to target and destroy each other's missiles. It is therefore unlikely that they can target the Federation's projectiles which move at an even higher speed, sometimes even faster than light.
1.11.1.20.5.1.3. Con: If they are laser based, this would make them vastly ineffective against Star Trek vessels shields and hulls.
1.11.1.20.5.1.4. Con: Star Wars capital ships have proven to be ineffective at engaging fighter sized craft due to their speed and maneauverability compared to the manual targeting of turbo lasers, this would suggest it was highly improbably that they could target and destroy a missile.
1.11.1.20.5.2. Pro: Nuclear and Thermonuclear weapons, both Fission and Fusion are well known in Star Trek, Both were abandoned centuries ago as they lacked utility and power compared to modern weaponry of the era.
1.11.1.20.5.3. Pro: This would allow the Federation, with minor modifications, to adapt to the Rebels and find items that are more effective against them. The sheer variance would likely be more than the Rebellion could deal with.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1. Pro: Photon torpedoes are the standard projectile armament of a Starfleet vessel. The current main one is a MKII Torpedo, which contains a 1.5kg matter/anti-matter charge, is 2 meters long and weighs 248kg. Scientifically it would be a 64.4MgT blast, but Star Trek states 690 gigatons. When fired with a warp booster, it can be fired at and travel at warp speeds. Thus its kinetic impact would be astounding.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.1. Pro: Voyager was equipped with type VI photon torpedoes, with a yield of 25 isotons. A class-6 warhead in this type of torpedo had the explosive yield of 200 isotons \(made up yields, so meaningless for this debate, though see notes on gravemetic torpedoes\). These torpedoes had an effective range of approximately eight million kilometers.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: Starfleet torpedo casings labeled as Mark V and Mark IIB torpedoes, and smaller tube components labeled with Mark IIB, Mark IV, Mark VI have also been observed.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.1.2. Con: The 25 isotons is the theoretical maximum yield limit for the standard photon torpedo first developed in 2268. This theoretical maximum was finally reached with the Mark IX warhead. \(p. 85\) This yield level statement would contradict the 200 isoton figure from "Scorpion, Part II", not to mention the special high yield torpedo from that episode, that was supposedly even more powerful.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.1.3. Pro: The explosive yield \(of the type-6 torpedo\) could be set to ten different levels. Level 1 was just a fireworks display, level 5 was the standard yield of one kilogram antimatter charge \(as opposed to the 1.5kg in MkII torpedoes\), and level 10 violated strategic arms limitation treaties.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.2. Pro: Voyager also carried class-9 and class-10 photon torpedoes, the class-10 torpedoes could be armed with even more powerful high yield warheads.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.3. Pro: Both 'Voyager' and 'Deep Space 9' references Mark XXV torpedoes.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.3.1. Con: The [Mark XXV torpedo](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Photon_torpedo) was the current design as of 2375. It has a dry mass of only 186.7 kilograms. The reactant capacity has increased five percent over the previous design, leading to a slightly higher yield of 18.5 isotons. The reactants are in a cryogenic state. Effective tactical range was increased to 4.05 million kilometers \([DS9:Technical Manual](https://www.scribd.com/document/23601433/Star-Trek-DS9-Technical-Manual): pp. 84, 94\). This range would also be inconsistent with the eight million kilometer range figure given in "Human Error".
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.4. Pro: Data used a high-energy burst level 6" yield setting on the photon torpedo warheads to expose tachyon signatures with inertial displacement as a convoy of cloaked Romulan warbirds. This setting presumably did not damage the warbirds. In "The Next Generation: "Redemption" Federation photon torpedoes had a display blast setting. A spread of torpedoes at this setting were detonated a kilometer from the surface of Ligon II as a warning burst to demonstrate the power of a galaxy-class starship.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.5. Pro: Photon torpedoes could be used for illumination. Torpedoes were used, by manually configuring them to emit luminous bursts with the initial dispersal of 6.9 kilometers.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.6. Pro: The self-destruct packages aboard the USS Defiant are photon warheads. On 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine', self-destruct is augmented with photon warheads scaled up 1.5 times of what is normally installed on torpedoes.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.7. Pro: In "Voyager: Living Witness", it's shown that a 25 isoton photon torpedo explosion could destroy an entire city within seconds. In "Voyager: The Omega Directive", it's shown that a 54 isoton yield gravimetric charge could blow up a small planet. An 80 isoton yield gravimetric torpedo was used by USS Voyager to destroy a harmonic resonance chamber containing approximately 144 million omega molecules \(72% of approximately 200 million\) in 2374 "Voyager: The Omega Directive".
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.7.1. Pro: A 90 isoton bomb of enriched ultritium had the explosion radius of 800 kilometers. Such a bomb was used to blow up a ketracel-white facility in Cardassian space in 2374. In "Deep Space 9: A Time to Stand", 200 isotons was the explosive yield of a photon torpedo with a class-6 warhead. In "Voyager: Scorpion, Part II", 320 isotons was the explosive yield of a class 12, Mark VI long-range photon torpedo \("Star Trek Into Darkness"\).
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.7.1.1. Pro: A 5 million isoton explosion of a multi-kinetic neutronic mine could affect an entire star system. The shock wave had a dispersive force radius of 5 light years. In "Voyager: Scorpion, Part II", these show power levels in excess of anything shown or generated in Star Wars.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.7.1.1.1. Con: The Federation does not have access to such a weapon, and its officers objected to the very idea of using anything like it. It was a Borg theoretical design.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: Th Federation would never use such a weapon. It is not in the habit of using weapons of indiscriminate genocide.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.7.1.1.1.2. Con: The design was proposed by Seven of Nine, who became a member of Voyagers crew and returned to the Federation with them. Thus the Federation do have access to the design, and the technology to make it.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.7.2. Con: This demonstrates a wild disparity in the numbers, suggesting an exponential rather than linear scale, if there is a scale at all. The claimed effect of a 25 isoton torpedo is in line with large nuclear bombs made in the 20th century, while the claimed effect of a 54 isoton charge is many orders of magnitude beyond that, despite being little over twice as large by the numbers.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.7.2.1. Con: Many things in Star Trek use exponential scale, for example warp drive. Warp 1 being the speed of light \(c\), warp two being a fraction over 10 c, warp 3 being 38.9 c, Warp 4 being 101.6 c and so on. It is not impossible to conclude that isoton yields also follow an exponential increase in yield.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.7.3. Pro: There is evidence to suggest an [Isoton](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/2qicor/firing_all_photon_torpedoes_from_isotons_to/) is 3,647,405.405 Tons. This would give a standard torpedo of 18.5 Isotons a yield of 67.662 Megatons. The prototype long-range torpedoes seen in 'Star Trek Into Darkness' have a yield of 320 Isotons, which puts out to about 1170.370 Megatons, or 1.17 Gigatons.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.8. Pro: Kinetic impact: A 248kg torpedo, travelling at .25c \(full impulse, no where near the warp speed they are capable of\) would impact like a 9.12MgT bomb just from impact \(and that's a very rough calculation with a lot of rounding\), without any explosion. Ships in Star Trek can take several of these with their shields up. We have even seen one pass through the hull of a ship without destroying it.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.8.1. Con: As the claim states, there is a lot of rounding in that figure, both up and down in various areas, so it is not very precise. It also assumes a lot of variables we do not have data for, and can be further influenced by a lot of other variables. Therefore it is a rough figure only and should not be relied upon.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.9. Pro: While many suggest that photon torpedoes have an inefficient omni-directional blast, it is shown in 'Star Trek 6, [The Next Generation](http://picard578.blogspot.com/2010/08/ufp-photon-torpedo-yield.html)' and 'Deep Space 9' that they actually do have a shaped charge and directional blast.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.9.1. Con: Then explain why, on multiple occasions they state that they could be damaged or even destroyed by the feedback from their own torpedo detonation at close ranges.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.9.1.1. Con: Even with a directional blast, not all energy goes in one direction. Some will always feedback. The feedback on a 690 gigaton+ explosion would still be considerable.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.9.1.2. Con: Comparing it to a modern day commonly available shaped charge, the claymore mine. Whilst a claymore has a 60 deg, 100m forward kill arc, it has a minimum safe  [firing distance](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/23-23/CH2.htm#s2p1) of 15m. Even directional charges cause damage in other directions, but the bulk is in the direction intended. Maximum non-lethal range of a claymore is 250m. Therefore, about 88% of the blast is in the intended direction, with 12% rear facing \(rear killzone is 120 deg, see below for more details.\).
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10. Pro: Photon torpedoes, logically, must be more powerful then most conventional nuclear weapons.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.1. Pro: Given the premise that Star Trek is set in the future, it would be illogical for them to ditch more powerful or effective weaponry, for something less effective, just as modern militarise would not stop using assault rifles and go back to bows and crossbows.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.1.1. Pro: In the episode "Balance of Terror" it is stated the Earth-Romulan war was fought with, by their standard, "primitive" atomic/nuclear weaponry. This was 100 years before the episode and we are not told if they mean fission or fusion weapons. However the episode was shot in 1966. Thermonuclear weapons had already been discovered, and the largest ever tested, the Tsar bomb, was tested in 1961, 5 years before the episode was produced. Thus it is logical to assume they mean fusion nukes.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.2. Con: It could be that nuclear weapons are more powerful but a less stable and safe form of weaponry to use in combat than photon torpedoes.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.2.1. Con: While this might hold true for the pacifistic and life loving Federation, it would fail to explain why the Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians and Dominion, all of whom have much less regard for life, moved away from nuclear weapons and to photon torpedoes.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.2.1.1. Con: The fact that the humans of the Federation managed to discover a way to weaponize nuclear reactions does not necessarily mean that other races managed to do the same.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.2.1.1.1. Pro: Similarly, the fact that those races are technologically advanced does not necessarily mean that they've thought of using nuclear reactions as a form of weapon.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.2.1.1.1.1. Con: While it is possible that such races weren't as foolish as Humans to develop nuclear weapons, given the aggressive, belligerent and warlike nature of races such as the Klingons, Cardassians and Jem Hadar, all of whom have fusion power sources, it seems unlikely they would not have thought of or found a way to weaponize such.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: The Ferengi never tested atomic weapons on their own planet, much less actually used them in combat, and Quark was shocked at the "stupidity" of Humans for polluting their own planet with atomic testing \(Deep Space 9: "Little Green Men"\).
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.2.1.1.2. Con: The Romulans at the very least did, as they also used nuclear weapons in the said Earth-Romulan war, and still used nuclear devices as a self-destruct device and back up weapon in the episode "Balance of Terror".
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: A list of other races that discovered nuclear weapons: Vulcans \(Enterprise: "Awakening"\),  Talosians \(The Original Series: "The Cage"/"The Menagerie"\), Ekos \(The Original Series: "Patterns of Force"\), the Yangs and Khoms \(The Original Series: "The Omega Glory"\), Elasians \(The Original Series: "Elaan of Troyius"\). Additionally the fusion bombs used by Vendikar and Eminiar VII in The Original Series: "A Taste of Armageddon" were a type of hydrogen bomb.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Nuclear winters were also seen in the following episodes from nuclear wars by unknown belligerents: "The Next Generation: A Matter of Time"; "Voyager: "Dragon's Teeth", "Friendship One"".
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.3. Pro: By the mid 23rd century, advances in hull materials technology led to nuclear weapons losing their tactical significance in ship-to-ship combat. Romulan Birds-of-Prey employed them solely as self-destruct devices, and such a warhead detonated point blank in front of a starship without shields raised, caused relatively light casualties as well as temporary electrical disruption. \(TOS: "Balance of Terror"\)
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.3.1. Pro: Against a seriously damaged Constitution-class starship, with only secondary systems operative, a single hit from a 20th century nuclear missile could cause severe damage to the ship if already in the atmosphere \(TOS: "Tomorrow is Yesterday"\).
By the time of the Next Generation, they were even less effective.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.3.2. Pro: A nuclear device \(likely fusion based\) of unspecified yield detonated against an un-shielded Constitution class starship at a distance of 100m = no significant damage.
A photon torpedo detonating within 15km of a much more advanced un-shielded Galaxy class starship = a more than likely destroyed ship. This would demonstrate that photon torpedoes are significantly more powerful than most nuclear devices.
1.11.1.20.5.3.1.10.3.2.1. Pro: As we see in the Deep Space Nine episode "Little Green Men", even a Ferengi shuttle can fly directly into the centre of an Atomic Nuclear Blast without worry, taking no damage.
1.11.1.20.5.3.2. Pro: Quantum Torpedoes: A newer, more powerful Torpedo. Approximately the same size and weight as a Photon Torpedo, there is little data on it, though it is considered more powerful than a Photon.
It is rated in Isotons, a fictional unit, so there is no scientifically accurate way to measure its potential.
Like the Photon is can be fired and travel at Warp speeds, and has a greater, extended range.
1.11.1.20.5.3.3. Pro: In addition to Photons and Quantums the Federation would have access to:
Seeking/Enveloping Plasma Torpedoes

First employed by the Romulans a Single one of these was capable of destroying most vessels. 
Two could overload the shields of and Destroy a starbase, including the entire Asteroid it was built on, reducing it to charred rubble.

They travelled at a little over warp speed but degraded in power with range.
Federation vessels captured examples.
1.11.1.20.5.3.3.1. Pro: They dealt damage all around the target to all facings at once and also operated by forcing an implosion in the target.

They also could reduce Cast rodinium, the hardest substance known to Star Trek science at the time science, used in hull and defence screens, to a brittle substance that Spock was able to crush with his bare hands.
1.11.1.20.5.3.4. Pro: Directed Plasma Torpedoes

These were more advanenvelop or have the shced versions of the early Romulan Plasma Torpedo. Even small platforms could carry thousands of them. Deployed by the Cardassian/Dominion Alliance and captured by Starfleet 110 years after the Romulan version. Though they did not have the individual destructive potential of the Enveloping torpedo, they were incredibly powerful and destructive, able to punch through most shields with ease and inflict considerable damage.
1.11.1.20.5.3.5. Pro: Chroniton torpedoes were ship-mounted weapons utilized by the the Krenim, a Delta Quadrant species which possessed deadly weapons based on temporal science. The torpedoes were capable of passing directly through an enemy's shields due to the fact that they were in a constant state of temporal flux.

They also reduced a ships movement speed and manoeuvrability by deploying a Chroniton field around the vessel.

Voyager brought technical specs back with them
1.11.1.20.5.3.6. Pro: The transphasic torpedo was an advanced type of torpedo weapon of unprecedented destructive potential used by Starfleet. The torpedoes could be launched from standard starship-mounted torpedo launchers. A single torpedo was capable of destroying a Borg cube. This weapon technology was acquired by the crew of USS Voyager in 2378 from Admiral Kathryn Janeway of an alternate timeline. They were capable of passing through shields.
1.11.1.20.5.3.7. Pro: A gravimetric torpedo was a type of torpedo weapon which could be created by outfitting a standard photon torpedo with a gravimetric charge. In theory, if a gravimetric torpedo were used to detonate a type-6 protostar, it could result in the formation of a wormhole.

It could create and distort local gravitational fields,and infuse a target with Graviton particles. This could render Rebel hyperdrives inoperative as well as slowing their speed and manoeuvrability.
1.11.1.20.5.3.7.1. Pro: In 2374, after having detected the presence of the Omega molecule in the Delta Quadrant, Kathryn Janeway, captain of the USS Voyager, ordered lieutenant commander Tuvok and ensign Harry Kim to outfit a photon torpedo with a gravimetric charge with a yield of fifty-four isotons, to create a gravimetric torpedo with which to destroy the molecule.
1.11.1.20.5.3.7.1.1. Pro: When further investigation revealed that there may have been hundreds of Omega molecules, Janeway ordered the yield increased to eighty isotons, which Harry Kim remarked to be enough to destroy a small planet.
1.11.1.20.5.3.7.2. Pro: According to the video game 'Star Trek: Starfleet Command III' \(soft-canon\), gravimetric torpedoes were the standard heavy weapon used by the starships of the Borg collective. The torpedoes utilize an advanced graviton inversion field to cause a gravimetric shear in its target, causing severe structural damage. In Star Trek Online, Borg instead use advanced plasma torpedoes like those utilised by the V'Ger probe, capable of destroying most ships in a single hit.
1.11.1.20.5.3.7.2.1. Pro: Gravimetric torpedoes are a special weapon available in the video game 'Star Trek Online' \(soft-canon\), and have the special effect of creating miniature gravity wells when impacting their targets.
1.11.1.20.5.3.8. Pro: [Tachyon and tetryon resonance](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Resonating_Tetryon_Beam_Array) torpedoes \(soft-canon only\). A type of torpedo that could be used to set up a tachyon resonance in a target, making them extremely susceptible to tachyon and tetryon based weaponry and cause their own shields to implode and crush them. They also tended to increase the accumulation of baryon particles, which could slow a ship down and decrease it's manoeuvrability, while simultaneously increasing its mass or creating a mass distortion or shadow.
1.11.1.20.5.3.8.1. Pro: This would severely hamper Rebel hyperdrives as the mass shadows/distortions would mean they could not make hyperspace jumps until they somehow cleared the particle buildup.
1.11.1.20.5.3.9. Pro: Tricobalt torpedoes use the fictional element tricobalt. At extremely high yields, they were capable of producing disruptions or even ruptures in subspace.
1.11.1.20.6. Pro: Although they are not the primary weapons of Federation craft, it is worth noting that the Federation have access to other weapons too. All of these can also be deployed as cannons with burst mode. Though it would require them to refit their ships, it means they can likely find more effective weapons if phasers prove insufficient as well as giving them a greater range and variety of weapons. And If one weapon were ineffective, they would have others that likely wouldn't be.
1.11.1.20.6.1. Pro: Laser weapons, abandoned by the Federation almost 100 years before Kirks days are well known and developed and considered both less powerful and have less utility and flexibility than Phaser weapons. Other, less advanced races, still use them.
1.11.1.20.6.2. Pro: Matter accelerator or beaming weapons, such as mass drivers and linear accelerators, or as exemplified by the TR-116 rifle.
1.11.1.20.6.3. Pro: Matter Disruptors, like those used by the Romulans, Klingons and Breen, sometimes just referred to as Disruptors. They can also be coupled with Phasers, as the Cardassians do, to create Spiral Wave Phasers and Disruptors and Phase Disruptors. They tend to be more powerful than Phasers, but less precise and have less extra utility and flexibility.
1.11.1.20.6.3.1. Pro: Later developments along this line allowed the Federation to make force beam Phasers and Compression Phasers, more powerful Phasers.
1.11.1.20.6.4. Pro: Tetryon beams, which in addition to doing damage as an energy weapon also tend to have an added effect of disrupting shields, as used by the Hirogen.
1.11.1.20.6.5. Pro: Polaron/phased polaron and anti-polaron beams as used by the Dominion.
1.11.1.20.6.6. Pro: There are also directional plasma beams, and plasma bolt cannons, that impart a substantially longer and more energised beam than those in Star Wars. In addition, Star Trek has been shown to have energy disrupting, draining and depleting weapons that can render power sources inert or deactivated, akin to Star Wars ion cannons.
1.11.1.20.7. Pro: Star Treks phasers are almost as powerful as their torpedoes, though the energy is focused to a point and thus less useful as a tool of mass destruction. They suffer no degradation in power for range or any appreciable dispersion. Atmosphere's also do not interfere with them for bombardment purposes. Turbolasers on the other hand, suffer power drop off for range \(as plasma weapons, due to dispersion and heat loss\).
1.11.1.20.7.1. Pro: In an alternate not-too-distant future, Starfleet also had access to Phaser Lances, a powerful weapon that could punch right through a fully shielded Klingon warship and completely destroy it in under 5 hits. While this is not suggesting Starfleet would have access to this in the course of the battle in question, it does show that there's evidence for a massive scaling of power based on size for phaser technology; that it can be adapted as a hull-puncher if the need arose as well as versatility.
1.11.1.20.7.2. Pro: [Ship-mounted phasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_in_Star_Trek) have a similar range of functions on a larger scale: The phasers on the USS Enterprise could be used as an 'anti-missile' defense to destroy incoming projectiles, stun entire city blocks full of people, destroy cities, and even destroy entire asteroids up to a given size. The ship's phaser system was also said to be capable of destroying continents. Starship phasers can be freely used while the ship is travelling at Warp speeds
1.11.1.20.7.3. Pro: TNG Inheritance-

DATA
We are within two kilometers of the magma pocket.

Earlier it was said the magma pocket was two kilometers from the core; which is 2800km down assuming an earth sized planet.

They can bore through 2000+km of crust and mantle in less than 20 seconds.

In another episode it was capable of cutting through a mile of solid granite in seconds
1.11.1.20.7.4. Con: [Phasers show weaknesses against armour](http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Tech/Beam/Beam1.html) \(As much as a loath to use this site and it's obvious bias in writing style, derogatory terms and insistence on "our" showing it to be a work of fandom and thus incapable of being unbiased, it's analysis in this situation is a helpful counter point...though it's other conclusions on Turbolasers are questionable as they use a discredited Astrophysicist who had no evidence to back up his claims or numbers\)
1.11.1.20.7.5. Pro: Although they are non-canon, the LUG, Decipher and Mophidius Star Trek RPG's all have Mark X phasers \(the type found on Modern Star Fleet vessels such as the Galaxy Class\) being comparable in power and damage output to MkII Photon Torpedoes
1.11.1.20.7.5.1. Pro: The Defiant's MkX Pulse phasers are between 12.5-25% more powerful, as well as being more rapid firing \(at the expense of versatility and utility\)
The Sovereign class uses newer, more powerful Mk XII arrays, estimated to be 20-25% more powerful
1.11.1.20.7.6. Pro: Turbolasers \(both Light and Heavy\) have a calculated range from multi Kiloton to a [few megatons](http://www3.telus.net/sci-fi-tech/SW-weapons.htm)

If Star Trek Phasers are nearly as Powerful as their torpedoes \(aprox. 64 Megatons\), then Phasers are vastly more powerful than even Heavy Turbolasers
1.11.1.20.7.7. Pro: Turbolasers also are not that good for [high orbit bombardment](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Turbolaser), unlike Phasers. "Turbolaser's effectiveness was weakened drastically as the bolt moved through layers of a planet's atmosphere, making them largely ineffective even against unshielded targets.".
1.11.1.20.7.7.1. Con: Other [sources](http://i.imgur.com/aVOp7HC.jpg) disagree. Of note, the XX-9s referred to were the standard turbolaser turret mounted on the Death Star and Imperial-1 Star Destroyers.
1.11.1.20.7.7.2. Con: Even if atmosphere bleeds off energy from turbolaser fire in that way, the energy doesn't just disappear. Shooting the atmosphere of a planet with nuclear-equivalent firepower looks like a nuclear fireball. That isn't much better for the inhabitants.
1.11.1.20.7.8. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.6.3.3.6.
1.11.1.20.7.9. Pro: [Phasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_in_Star_Trek) logically must also be superior to most forms of laser weaponry \(despite the fact that there, theoretically, is no upper limit on the power of a laser\). This is, using real world logic, demonstrable by the fact that the Federation moved from laser weapons \(seen in the cage and the menagerie\) to phasers. They would not do this unless phasers offered some tangible benefit and advantage over lasers.
1.11.1.20.7.9.1. Pro: These could be: Increased power and damage, more precision \(unlikely\), greater accuracy, increased range, better shield and/or armour penetration, more utility, greater rate of fire, better arcs of fire, more energy efficient, or a combination of the above. Likely a great number of the above, as most in universe sources would suggest for power/damage output, range, shield/armour penetration, rate of fire and greater utility and flexibility.
1.11.1.20.8. Pro: Rebel proton torpedoes and concussion missiles can be used for bombardment of targets showing them to be not much more devastating then conventional munitions. The Federation [photon torpedoes](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Photon_torpedo) are 1.5kg matter-antimatter explosives. Even the least generous estimate makes this equivalent to a 64.4MgT nuclear weapon.
1.11.1.20.8.1. Pro: Federation claims that this is liquid deutrium for anti-matter: Density of mere liquid antideuterium is around 160 kilograms per cubic meter. According to this comparison the high annihilation rate energy release would be comparable to the effects in a [690 gigaton explosion](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Photon_torpedo). Additionally there are quantum torpedoes which are more powerful still.
1.11.1.20.8.1.1. Con: 1.5Kg is 1.5Kg, regardless of what it is as mass does not change. As such this is an example of bad science to justify an increased power in show.
1.11.1.20.8.1.1.1. Con: Though it is admittedly bad science, it does not change the claim made in the technical manual that photon torpedoes produce a 690 gigaton yield.
1.11.1.20.8.2. Con: Proton torpedoes and concussion missiles have not been shown bombarding a target of known durability, so their power is an open question.
1.11.1.20.8.2.1. Con: Proton Torpedoes are Shown striking the death star when they miss the exhaust port. Their damage is about or less spectacular then Strafing it with "lasers", barely making Stormtroopers wobble, rather than causing explosions.

We have also seen Proton Bombs being used on Asteroids...and causing very, very little effect \(EPV\)
1.11.1.20.8.2.1.1. Con: We don't know what the Death Star is made of, so it is not useful for measuring the destructive capabilities of weapons.  

Vader wanted the Millennium Falcon intact and its crew alive, so using high yield weapons likely to destroy the ship rather than flush it out would have been counterproductive.
1.11.1.20.8.2.1.1.1. Con: While we do not know what the properties of the Death Stars hull are, we can safely say the impacts of both Laser weaponry and Proton torpedoes against it are less then spectacular.
1.11.1.20.8.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Of course it IS a heavily armoured battle station \(and looks heavily armoured\) designed to rout a full scale attack from Capital sized star ships. So it likely has very advanced, very thick armour. Of course Starfighter weapons are going to be mostly ineffective against it.
1.11.1.20.8.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Even if it is well armoured, given the nature of Star Wars weapons, there would be significant outward explosions \(especially if they breech the hull at all\).

While there are some, they are not of a scale to suggest Star Wars weapons are that impressive
1.11.1.20.8.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Not knowing what the hull and armour of the Death Star are composed of, it is difficult to tell what effect or interaction it would have with the weapons.
1.11.1.20.8.3. Pro: [Photon torpedoes](http://www.st-v-sw.net/Obsidian/Martin/photontorpedo.htm) have a 4km radius and would obliterate any rebel ship in the sphere of effect.
1.11.1.20.8.3.1. Con: Scooter is a notorious liar and shouldn't be considered a reliable source. The Enterprise D is 641 meters long. For this to be true, the observable blast diameter of a photon torpedo would have to be over six times larger than the Enterprise's length. This never happens.
1.11.1.20.8.3.1.1. Con: Yet a single photon can destroy an unshielded Miranda instantly with no observable debris. There are plenty of examples of them stating "at this close range, with our shields down" they could be destroyed by their own torpedoes. In every case, observable onscreen evidence would indicate more than a km distance.
1.11.1.20.8.3.1.1.1. Con: The destruction of a Federation starship is always a matter of uncertainty, because their fuel source has extremely serious potential for a catastrophic secondary explosion even from a relatively minor hit.
1.11.1.20.8.3.1.1.2. Con: That the torpedo is a danger to the firing ship conclusively demonstrates one thing: Whatever the estimated total yield is, cut it in half at least before accounting for how much energy is delivered to the target. An omnidirectional blast wastes much of its energy potential.
1.11.1.20.8.3.1.2. Con: Blast effects for a 64.4MgT in an atmosphere \(interestingly, space explosions would be larger, but less powerful\): Fireball radius: 6.65km, 20psi air blast radius: 8.72km, air blast radius \(1 psi\): 47.2 km, thermal radiation radius \(3rd degree burns\): 55.7 km. Thus the radius of the explosion shouldn't be in question
but you may have an argument for the destructive potential, and again these are assuming minimum yield for a photon and not 690gigatons.
1.11.1.20.8.3.2. Pro: When fired by a starship without shields, at a target in close range, a single photon detonation had a high probability of destroying the firing ship as well \(Star Trek Generations; TNG: "Q Who", "Unnatural Selection"\). If a photon torpedo was fired by a starship with shields, at a target in close range, the torpedo explosion could cripple the firing ship \(TNG: "The Nth Degree"\). The minimum range of a photon torpedo is 15km according to [Star Trek Wiki](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Photon_torpedo) \(about 3/4 down the page\).
1.11.1.20.9. Pro: Star Wars has no on-screen ranges, but generous estimates put max weapon range at 5,000km. Star Trek has a confirmed on-screen weapon range of [250,000km](http://www.st-v-sw.net/STSW-WeaponRange-Trek.html), and theoretical ranges of [300,000km-4,500,000km.](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Photon_torpedo) Star Trek outrange the rebels by at least 50 times minimum.
1.11.1.20.9.1. Con: Range is irrelevant in Star Wars space battles. Fleets appear from hyperspace, fight in close range with lots of fighters and dissapear instantly. Any long range attack could be easily avoided.
1.11.1.20.9.1.1. Con: Hyperspace jumps require time to plot and have no scans of real space while in hyperspace. Thus they are only useful for fixed point attacks. If the enemy is mobile, such a tactic is useless.
1.11.1.20.9.1.2. Con: Star Trek ships have a clear sublight advantage \(on the order of 800x\). So even dropping out of hyperspace, Federation vessels could move out of range before the Star Wars ships could cause damage, while inflicting punishing damage themselves from out of range before Star wars vessels could plot a withdrawal jump.
1.11.1.20.9.2. Pro: This is even supported [here](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Turbolaser): "Some turbolaser had a limited range of effectiveness, as seen when the Supremacy's weapons were unable to cause damage to the Raddus from a long distance" \(long distance still being visual range, which is less than a couple of hundred Km in space\).
1.11.1.20.9.3. Pro: The range for proton torpedoes is given as: [200m \(optimal\), 600m \(max\)](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/MG7-A_proton_torpedo/Legends). However, this is legends sources and should not be accepted as canon. The canon sources simply state ["Several kilometres"](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/MG7-A_proton_torpedo), which is vastly inferior to modern weaponry \(air-to-air and air-to-ground\) missiles, never mind the 100k+ km of Federation weapons.
1.11.1.20.9.4. Con: Engagements in the hundreds of thousands of kilometers range are extremely rare in Star Trek and exclusively take place against stationary or near-stationary targets. In Deep Space Nine "[The Die is Cast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vSp9CLyImA#t=1m27s)", Captain Sisko orders the Defiant to close within 500 meters before opening fire, presumably deriving some advantage from that range.
1.11.1.20.9.4.1. Con: In "Star Trek :The Next Generation" episode "The Wounded", the Phoenix clearly engages a Cardassian cruiser and transport at over [250,000km,](http://www.st-v-sw.net/STSW-WeaponRange-Trek.html) with weapon range stated as being [300,000km](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZjhyAw3ODk). Neither of these targets is "[stationary](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Wounded_\(episode\)?file=Weapon_ranges_overlay_remastered.jpg)" or "near stationary".
1.11.1.20.9.4.1.1. Con: That screenshot has no range indicator. What it does have is the output of the Cardassian disruptors at a mere 700 megawatts.
1.11.1.20.9.4.1.1.1. Pro: Granted that the Cardassian's weapons \(assumed to be compression phasers or spiral wave disruptors\) have an output at 700 megawatts, which is very small, and though they do no appreciable damage to the Phoenix when they hit it, they are an order of magnitude smaller than 400GW, which is good support for the 400GW claim.
1.11.1.20.9.5. Pro: Star Trek Voyager lists torpedoes as having a 8 million km range in the episode "[Human Error](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Human_Error_\(episode\))".
1.11.1.20.9.6. Pro: In "The Search - Part 1" \(Deep Space Nine\), it is stated that [100,000km](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Search,_Part_I_\(episode\)) is "well within" the Jem Hadar's effective weapon range, when it is stated this is how close they would flyby the cloaked Defiant.
1.11.1.20.10. Con: -> See 1.11.1.6.10.
1.11.1.21. Con: Federation ships are not equipped for anti-aircraft roles, which gives the Rebels an advantage.
1.11.1.21.1. Con: Starfleet phasers have shown the ability to rapid-fire when used at [lower durability targets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCYirVh6ZWY), allowing them to clear fighters easily.
1.11.1.21.2. Con: StarFleet ships are extremely well equipped for anti-aircraft, anti-spacecraft, and ground attack roles, and are continually being improved. The crews are highly adaptable, and adept at learning and integrating new tactics and technology. This is a major plot point in nearly every episode of every series.
1.11.1.21.3. Con: Federation weaponry is more than capable of acting in an anti-fighter capacity.
1.11.1.21.3.1. Pro: Phasers have been shown to target individual components with great accuracy. They have also been shown to be able to target small, fast moving and even manoeuvrable craft and objects with a high degree of accuracy and hit rate. They are also capable of rapid fire to deal with many targets at once.
1.11.1.21.3.2. Pro: Phasers can be set to wide-angle and wide beam mode. This dramatically decreases their range \(though still able to reach ground from high orbit\) and limits their power output, but allows them to cover an area greater than most cities. It is likely this would still be sufficient to deal with a swarm of incoming fighters, or at the very least stun their pilots, possibly still at a range greater than the fighters can engage at.
1.11.1.21.3.3. Pro: In Balance of Terror, Phasers are shown to be able to be set to have a proximity detonation mode and explode. They inflict considerable damage on an unshielded, but armoured cloaked vessel with near misses rather than direct hits. This is very likely enough to take out a considerable number of fighters at a time.
1.11.1.21.3.3.1. Con: [Rebel Alliance fighters](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/%22Defender%22_deflector_shield_generator), with the exception of the A-Wing, have been repeatedly shown to have [deflectors](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Deflector_shield/Legends) capable of shrugging off multiple direct hits from directed energy weapons.
1.11.1.21.3.3.1.1. Con: [Ray shields](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ray_shield) deflect beam weapons, and may be ineffective against a local antimatter explosion produced by [photon torpedoes](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Photon_torpedo).
1.11.1.21.3.3.1.2. Con: Ray shields may still be susceptible to the [particles and radiation](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Nadion) emitted by phasers.
1.11.1.21.3.3.1.3. Con: [Particle shields](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Particle_shield/Legends) may leave craft vulnerable to the energy component of a phaser beam, as well as to the explosive output of torpedoes in the vicinity.
1.11.1.21.3.3.1.4. Con: [Particle shields](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Particle_shield/Legends) render craft completely vulnerable when they fire their own projectiles. Starfleet targeting computers would be able to hit these crafts in the moment that their shields are down to fire.
1.11.1.21.3.3.1.5. Con: No Rebel fighter is shown to shrug off multiple direct energy weapon hits. In fact, the Battles of Yavin and Endor show us fully shielded fighters exploding after a single hit by another fighters weapons. Even Luke and Wedge take significant damage from single shots that blow right past their shields.
1.11.1.21.3.4. Pro: Photon Torpedoes can be set for remote, manual, pre-set and proximity fuses and detonation. Given that these are essentially multi-mega-ton \(or even giga-ton\) explosions, they would be sufficient to sweep fighters from space at a considerable range without ever having to score a direct hit or impact.
1.11.1.21.4. Con: It's shown in 'The Next Generation' that the Enterprise would have been capable of targeting a shuttlecraft and it was necessary to enter a sensor blind spot. There is little reason to believe that the 3.5 meter difference between a Starfleet shuttle and an X-Wing fighter would protect the X-Wing.
1.11.1.21.4.1. Con: Capital ships of all powers in the Star Trek universe, and regardless of weapon type, have not been shown to be either consistent or exceptionally accurate when targeting smaller craft. They actually do miss.
1.11.1.21.4.2. Con: The question is not just one of size, but of maneuverability. Federation shuttles, the heavily modified Delta Flyer excepted, have not been shown to be especially maneuverable and are not intended for combat.
1.11.1.21.5. Con: Star Wars canon attack craft do not possess the firepower to get through the superior defenses of a Star Trek canon ship. Even a smaller, older ship like the Reliant \(seen in Wrath of Kahn\) would be able withstand continued barrage from several x-wing fighters.
1.11.1.21.6. Con: The torpedoes and beams of the Federation move at the speed of light or faster. This is ideal for removing the threat of lightly shielded and lightly armored Rebel fighters.
1.11.1.22. Pro: Federation computer systems seem more advanced then their Star Wars counter parts, able to perform more operations at once and to process things faster, allowing for a higher degree of automation.
1.11.1.22.1. Con: The Rebel Alliance has Droids. Starfleet's only "Droid" is a one of a kind Android, Data.
1.11.1.22.1.1. Con: Data is the only sentient, self aware android in Starfleet, the original Series and TNG both have examples of other Robots within Starfleet, such as the EXOCOMPS. further, the majority of Star Wars droids are Robots, and not true androids. Chances are most if not all could be remotely shut down by a standard tricorder as it has a remote access interface designed to interface with alien computers.
1.11.1.22.2. Con: Star Wars computers has not been seen in action, and it is unclear how quickly they operate in normal conditions. That said, the hyperspace tracker in The Last Jedi was a computer encased in a hyperspace field that permitted it to calculate all possible destinations of a hyperspace jump and determine the correct one in moments.
1.11.1.22.2.1. Con: Computers have been seen in action, being referred to as droids. Decentralized AI slaves who need to have their memories wiped regularly and their will and self-agency externally disabled in order to keep them captive to do the labor \(computing\). It takes one droid 15 seconds to stand still and ask the central computer of the Death Star for a map. If C3-PO can translate and calculate odds mid conversation, the decentralization must be a policy or IP remnant of some historical necessity.
1.11.1.22.2.2. Con: We see how long it takes Threepio to talk to the Falcons Computer. Given the time passage, seems to be a rather slow process
1.11.1.22.2.2.1. Con: Of course, this could be put down to C3P0 being an extremely chatty and annoyingly procrastinating Droid and nothing to do with the Falcon's computer.
1.11.1.22.2.3. Con: Hypothetical points like assertions based on that Star Wars computers haven't been seen in action, are not strong enough arguments to combat the existing and proven computer technology prowess onboard Federation vessels and stations.
1.11.1.22.2.4. Con: The fact we have not seen them in action might also imply that they do not exist or are not that advanced.
1.11.1.22.2.4.1. Pro: The fact that they employ droids, such as protocol droids and astromech droids on smaller craft, and even to an extent on larger craft might be taken as evidence that Star Wars starship computers are not otherwise suitably advanced.
1.11.1.22.2.4.1.1. Pro: Federation vessels meanwhile show the same computing ability on shuttlecraft and runabouts as they do on full sized starships.
1.11.1.22.2.4.2. Pro: There is no visual evidence for voice input or interface with the Star Wars computers \(unlike in Star Trek\). Instead everything appears to be manual input and interface.
1.11.1.22.2.4.3. Pro: The only examples of starship computer systems we see, are on the Millennium Falcon, when Han Solo requires 3PO to talk to the Falcon to work out what is wrong with the hyperdrive. The fact it requires a droid to do so, would indicate the system to be less accessible and user friendly to biological lifeforms.
1.11.1.22.2.4.3.1. Pro: We've also heard of navigational computers, used on larger vessels, such as the Falcon and most capital ships, in place of astromech droids. They fulfil the same function, calculating navigational and hyperspace routes and take considerable time to do so. In essence, they are like the brains of astromech droids without a chassis, and show no extra abilities, which does not seem that advanced comparatively.
1.11.1.22.3. Pro: The [tricorder](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Starfleet_tricorder) is beyond anything computerised ever demonstrated in star wars and is almost [Mary-Sue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue) calibre in its function and versatility.
1.11.1.23. Pro: Starfleet is at the point where it can use holographic technology to a higher degree than the Rebels. This includes holographic decoy ships, and entire holographic crews, such as the [EMH](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Holographic_program), [EMH MkII,](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Holographic_programs) [LMH](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Long-term_Medical_Holographic_program) and [ECH](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Emergency_Command_Hologram), and even a holographic [diagnostic program](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Jupiter_Station_Diagnostic_Program_Alpha-11), with plans for other departments.
1.11.1.24. Con: Rebels have the technology for heavy jamming and the experience of fighting under heavy jamming technology.
1.11.1.24.1. Pro: The Federation is vulnerable to jamming as its members have little experience with manual control. The Rebels, in contrast to that, are experienced in fighting and flying without computer aid.
1.11.1.24.1.1. Con: Starfleet cadets do learn manual control, as shown with a [notorious academy disaster](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Kolvoord_Starburst). Manual control was also possible in Insurrection. Worf has used manual targeting a variety of times. Starfleet merely uses automatic controls to improve what's already great.
1.11.1.24.1.2. Pro: Star Trek shows examples of fighting cloaked vessels, which by their nature cannot be directly targeted. This is seen very well in 'Balance of Terror' and 'Nemesis', in both of which, the cloaked ship is moving and they are forced to target and fire manually.
1.11.1.24.1.2.1. Con: In many of the examples of fighting cloaked ships, the Federation still uses sensors to detect "anomalies" or "detect the origination of the shot". Sensors being jammed eliminates their usage in this scenario.
1.11.1.24.1.2.1.1. Con: These methods of detection were not a part of Starfleet's sensor package, but were comprised of more sensitive technologies of different types. In Star Trek VI, it was specialized equipment from a probe. The tachyon net is also not based on shipboard sensors.
1.11.1.24.1.2.1.2. Con: There is no evidence to suggest they could not use visual evidence of the shots origin, extrapolation on movement and firing pattern, or even their own individual experience to still target the shots manually, or use other methods \(such as Troi's emphatic powers to manually target as they did in 'Nemesis'\).
1.11.1.24.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: In the DS9 Episode "Rules of Engagement" Worf uses his experience to predict the tactics of a cloaked ship.
1.11.1.24.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: The Klingons used obvious tactics, and did so to lure Worf into a trap and into making a mistake.
1.11.1.24.1.2.1.3. Con: There is no evidence in the Star Wars franchise of an ability to jam sensors. The only example of sensor masking that is seen, in 'Return of the Jedi', is officially explained as masking the shields energy and EM output, and not actually jamming sensors.
1.11.1.24.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Even if this was considered to be a form of sensor jamming, it was something performed by the imperials, and there is no evidence that the rebels possess the ability to replicate it.
1.11.1.24.2. Pro: Jamming technology has been shown to shut down essential systems of Federation ships, such as targeting and teleporters.
1.11.1.24.2.1. Con: Without knowing exactly what kind of jamming techniques are being used by the rebels, there's no way to gauge if it would be effective or useless against Starfleet technology.
1.11.1.24.2.2. Pro: Only very specific forms of jamming seem to effect their targeting sensors, and a slightly greater range the transporters. There is no evidence that the Rebels could duplicate these forms of jamming with their primitive methods. Even then, "shutting down" might be a stretch.
1.11.1.24.2.2.1. Con: In Star Trek, a low tech civilization used a single jamming method to shut down the teleporters, communications and targeting lock. It didn't seem to require a specific form of jamming to kill all 3 in one go. Especially where the civilization in question was technologically inferior to the Federation.
1.11.1.24.2.2.1.1. Pro: The 20th century United States is primitive indeed by Federation standards, but the presence of a shielded nuclear reactor aboard an aircraft carrier prevented transport, phaser function, sensor function, and communications all in one go during the events of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.
1.11.1.24.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The radiation actually only caused specific problems for Communications and the hand phasers. While it contributed to problems with the Transporters and Sensors, these were actually caused more by it being a Klingon ship, that was cloaked and low on power, with a failing power core. After all, they managed to beam Uhura out just fine, but had to go one at a time due to the low power & radiation combo.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2. Con: Federation sensors have been jammed by all manner of things and transporters are even worse, stopped by naturally occurring ionizing radiation, the presence of an electrical transformer, a large lightning storm \(which stopped both transporters and sensors in TNG Season 3, Ep# 55: "The Enemy"\), and the natural magnetic field of an inhabitable moon \(again stopping transporters and sensors in TNG Season 4, Ep# 83: "Final Mission"\).
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.1. Con: In the episode Final mission, the sensors of a civilian mining vessel that was described as 'about 100 years old' were unable to fully penetrate a very strong magnetic field around the surface. These sensors were also failing at the time. there is no mention of transporter inhibition in this episode. although not expressly mentioned, the field seems to have no effect on the enterprises senors, which locate Wesley and the captain.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.2. Con: In the episode The enemy, the planet Galorndon Core is a planet ravaged by severe electrical storms that created charged particle precipitation that interfered with communications and sensors. Transporters were able to work fine, however as senors were affected, creating multiple sensor ghosts, the transporter was unable to lock onto its target without a targeting mark \(beam out marker\), however transportation to the planets surface appeared to be unaffected.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: In The Next Generation episode "Power Play" the USS Enterprise-D is confronted with extreme interference due to electromagnetic whirlwinds on the moon, which renders the sensors incapable of picking up life signs and makes transporting dangerous. They take a shuttle but it crashes. Later O'Brien is able to transport down, and uses pattern enhancers to beam everyone back up.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.3. Pro: Some forms of radiation and substances, usually minerals such as kelbonite, prevented transporters from working. In most instances, the interference was caused by scattering of the annular confinement beam, or sensor interference preventing a transporter lock. Examples of radiation and substance limitations are: magnesite, thoron radiation, dampening field, ionic interference \(also Ion storm\), hyperonic radiation, and electromagnetic storm.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4. Pro: The Death Star emitted a particularly strong magnetic field, powerful enough to interfere with starfighters passing through it. This was likely caused by the station's power reactor, and if this is a property of Star Wars power reactors we can expect to find similar, albeit smaller scaled, magnetic fields around essentially all large Rebel vessels.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.1. Con: This was not caused by the stations reactor. [Magnetic fields/shields](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Magnetic_field/Legends) and magcon fields were a type of shield designed to keep the atmosphere in or out.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.1.1. Con: The Death Star was clearly not holding an atmosphere several kilometers above its surface.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.1.1.1. Pro: If the [magnetic field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WBG2rJZGW8#t=2m05s) encountered by Red and Gold Squadrons at minimum several hundred kilometers from the station was holding in an atmosphere, vacuum survival gear would not be required to stand in the equatorial trench, [and yet it was](https://imgur.com/bbSL8cK).
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con: The magnetic field surrounding the death star was at most 37km from the surface. Given the size of the death star, this is almost skin tight, similar to how small a layer the atmosphere of the earth is compared to the radius of the earth.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: If the field was encountered no more than 37 km from the Death Star, the station's apparent size from the fighters would have been much greater than it was.  At that range, the station would dominate the entire forward view.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The magnetic field could be no bigger than 37 kilometers from the Deathstar given the velocity the rebel fighters were travelling at and the time taken to arrive at the Deathstar after entering the field. Given that they only accelerate to attack speed after entering the field, and we have already shown attack speed to be about 3600kmph, 37 km is in fact a generous estimate. and has been told again and again, what's shown in the movies is ultimate canon, regardless of all other evidence.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The Death Star was in the light of Yavin's star.  An atmosphere 37 km in depth would noticeably refract the sunlight, yet no such refraction is in evidence.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Here is an image of the [earth](https://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/1000_1x_/public/images/2016/04/earthrise_high_res.jpg?itok=dq25SR_o), a planet with an atmosphere of 300km, seen at a distance of 384,000km and clearly within the light of the sun, yet we see no such light refraction either.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.1.1.1.2. Con: We do not know that survival gear was required. Yes, according to wookieepedia these are space troopers, and the backpack is a re-breather, but that is not evidence that it was required. British soldiers are all equipped with a knife, but they don't run around using it all the time. 

In fact, it is more likely that the re-breather is a part of their armour and uniform and is there for use outside the shield, or in the event the shield fails.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.2. Con: This also ignores the concept that ray shields are very likely magnetic in nature and unlike particle shields, do not appear to be skin tight to the craft. It is equally plausible that they are passing through the Death Stars main defensive screens and hence why they needed to put their shields double front to survive the passage through it.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.2.1. Con: The magnetic field was encountered at minimum a few hundred \([Dr. Saxton suggests several thousand](http://www.theforce.net/swtc/ds/index.html#shield4)\) kilometers from the station.  Shielding that far out would be worthless as a combat defense, as the capital ships its meant to defend against could simply cruise through it and fire from inside the shield bubble.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.2.1.1. Con: The Imperial ships feature other such obvious flaws and weaknesses in their designs that this is not entirely implausible.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.2.2. Con: If ray shields are magnetic in nature, that's not any better re: implications for transporters and sensors.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.3. Con: There is no on screen evidence, either visual or auditory to support the assertion that this is created by the Stations Hyper-matter reactor, or a feature of hyper matter reactors.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.3.1. Pro: There is no on-screen evidence, visual or auditory, to support the idea that all reactors, and therefore all ships create such a magnetic field. In fact there are enough instances to show this not to be the case.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.4. Con: There is no evidence as to the power of the magnetic field. That is it is strong is an inference, from the line "we're passing through the magnetic field \(others suggest he says shield\), set your deflectors double front". As it was drawn attention to and we don't see them do that for planets, it is inferred to be strong, but no idea how strong.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.4.1. Pro: Magnetic fields are rated in microteslas. The Earth's magnetic field is in tens of microteslas. Electromagnetic storms are probably rated in the magnitude of milliteslas or whole teslas. Such intense fields can only be felt within proximity to a wire with an incredible amount of current. Such proximity could allow electrons to "jump" from the wire to whatever was nearby, and that amount of current would be fatal. As none of the X-wing pilots is fried, the Magnetic field can't be that strong.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.4.2. Pro: There is no evidence to suggest it would be strong enough to disrupt Federation Transporters, sensors or targeting. Also, somewhat irrelevant as it was on the Death Star, an Imperial station, not a Rebel one.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.4.4.3. Pro: Rebel fighters put their deflectors on double front going through it, but beyond that suffered no further ill effect, not even turbulence or noticeable power drain or shield loss. This would seem to indicate rebel fighter shields on double front were enough to handle it. This does not support that it was a particularly strong field.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.5. Con: There is no evidence that the Rebels would be able to duplicate or recreate any of these effects.
1.11.1.24.2.2.2.6. Con: The natural magnetic field of the moon was a particularly and unusually string one. All planets \(that we know of\) have a magnetic field and magnetic poles, of varying strength. As Star Trek can transport on a majority of planets, it takes a particularly strong field to disrupt transports, sensors and/or targeting.
1.11.1.24.3. Con: If shipboard sensors could be jammed, Starfleet vessels can launch probes outside of the jamming radius to get the same \(or more\) information that would normally be provided by their sensors.
1.11.1.24.4. Con: Star Wars has lots of examples of communication jamming, only one example of sensor jamming, and precisely zero examples of targeting jamming. This is not a very good example of fighting under "heavy" jamming.
1.11.1.24.4.1. Pro: Communication jamming in particular would be useless against the Federation: they don't have technologies that target subspace communications.
1.11.1.24.4.2. Pro: There is even less evidence to support the idea that when manually aiming they can only hit things that are sitting still, as in almost every example of manual aiming in Star Trek, the targets are still moving. Starfleet personnel often show extreme creativity in over coming such difficulties. So the claim they can only hit stationary targets is clearly and demonstrably false.
1.11.1.24.4.2.1. Con: In the episode 'Redemption' - Worf manually targets to prevent the enemy from detecting a target lock. Both the ship he is on and the enemy ships are at a complete stand still when he fires. Not every example is a moving target.
1.11.1.24.5. Con: Star Trek shows considerably examples of being able to hit without sensors or automatic targeting, even by largely untrained crews: In Star Trek II, they battle in the Mutara nebula, where they even state that sensors will be useless and unable to automatically target. Both ships are constantly moving within the nebula and engage in a game of cat and mouse.
1.11.1.24.5.1. Con: The only hits in that fight were from point blank range or instances when the targets were standing still.
1.11.1.24.5.1.1. Pro: The shots were from comparative point blank range by Federation standards. Observe the [battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcEHM8GFSwM). At 3:25, the Reliant makes a longer range shot. Though the shot misses, it was meant as a warning shot \(Kirks comments afterwards make that clear\).
1.11.1.24.5.1.2. Con: Nearly all the shots were on the move. Though both ships are travelling at slow or comparative velocities, they are still moving. [The battle in the Mutara nebula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcEHM8GFSwM): 6:03, 6:11 - Both ships are clearly seen moving at different elevations. To get back in arc they would clearly have to move. As they can't detect each other it would be illogical to suggest they just suddenly stop. 6:18 - The Enterprise is clearly turning/banking to remain in the nebula.
1.11.1.24.5.1.2.1. Pro: [The battle:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcEHM8GFSwM) 6:31 - The Enterprise moves behind the Reliant, 6:50 they fire and are clearly still moving \(but miss\), 6:56 - Reliant fires on the move \(and misses\). 7:03 - Kirk orders Saavik to hold her course. This wouldn't be necessary if it was stationary. 7:18 - Enterprise is clearly still moving forward slowly. 7:28 - Kirk orders hard to starboard, to avoid a collision. 7:33 - Reliant is still moving forward too and scores a hit on the Enterprise \(which is still manoeuvring\).
1.11.1.24.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Mutara battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcEHM8GFSwM): 7:42 - Enterprise returns fire and hits Reliant. Both ships are still moving. During the [battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8O_C7T5H_s): 0:07 - Spock says "could be an impulse turn", showing Reliant is still manoeuvring and moving. 0:34 - Enterprise comes to full stop, then lowers its elevation or relative altitude \(a rough term as there is no up or down in space\). 1:32 - Enterprise moves up behind Reliant. Reliant is still moving forward. 1:52 Reliant is moving forward, Enterprise is closing and fires.
1.11.1.24.5.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Conclusion of Battle:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8O_C7T5H_s) At 1:56 - 2:13 -the Enterprise scores several telling hits on Reliant \(note at 2:07 Enterprise is quite clearly still moving forward, showing in the previous shot where they looked still, they were moving at matched velocities\). At 2:24 - despite damage, Reliant is still moving after attack and even turning.
1.11.1.24.5.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: At [5:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8O_C7T5H_s) - a crippled Reliant is still moving and turning \(as can be seen by ionised spark trail from its destroyed nacelle\), which is clearly momentum from its previous movement. This shows it was still moving when hit.
1.11.1.24.6. Con: There are reasons to believe Rebel jamming technology would be ineffective against Federation vessels. Federation vessels appear to have superior automated systems, computers, targeting systems, and more importantly, sensors. As such, due to their superiority in these fields, it is unlikely that Rebel jamming would be effective, especially given the disparity in tech levels, designs and styles.
1.11.1.24.6.1. Pro: There is evidence that based on their technology, Star Trek would have superior Electronic Warfare\(EW\)/Electronic Counter Measures\(ECM\), as well as countermeasures to enemy use of EW and ECM.
1.11.1.24.6.2. Pro: Federation vessels have demonstrated more than one type of tracking, targeting and sensor system.
1.11.1.24.6.3. Pro: All Starfleet vessels are built with an automated threat assessment/tracking/targeting system \(TA/T/TS\) for all their weapons. While there is limited evidence for jamming of this system, they still tend to score more hits than misses in combat.
1.11.1.24.7. Con: Starfleet crews demonstrate equal ability to fly without computer aid or assistance and some of them are considered expert pilots. There is less evidence for them being as experienced aiming manually, though some examples exist among their tactical officers and command officers.
1.11.1.24.7.1. Pro: During episode 'Chain of Command pt 2' Laforge: "You know, this trip into the nebula's going to need someone who can do Titan's turn in their sleep. These mines need to be laid within 2 km of the Cardassian ships but the particle flux from the nebula will blind all the sensors except for this proximity detector. You're going to need one heck of a pilot to pull that off." Jellico: "Is that you?" Laforge: "I could do it, but truthfully, the man you want is Commander Riker. He's the best there is."
1.11.1.24.7.2. Pro: [Tom Paris](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_Paris) is also considered an excellent pilot in Voyager, which is part of the reason he was selected \(along with his knowledge of the Badlands and Marquis\). [Hikaru Sulu](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Hikaru_Sulu) was also considered to be an expert helmsman in the original series and movies.
1.11.1.24.7.3. Pro: During episode "[Booby Trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKZQnkY2fXk)" Picard pilots the Enterprise, and during episode "[11001001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2ffEba46oQ)" Picard takes the helm. In the Episode "In Theory" Picard pilots a shuttle to lead the Enterprise to safety.
1.11.1.25. Pro: While the Rebels have fighters, Federation capital chips are far more manoeuvrable then their Rebellion counterparts, able to make extreme course corrections and evasive manoeuvres Rebel ships could only dream and wish for. This is a key issue and has [many implications,](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/16748/what-is-the-point-of-evasive-maneuvers-in-star-trek/16751) both in terms of attack and defence.
1.11.1.25.1. Pro: The additional maneuverability of even the largest Star Trek ships renders Star Wars Bombers, with their powerful but unpiloted proton bombs, ineffective unless the Star Trek ship was first completely immobilized.
1.11.1.25.2. Con: Even though Star Trek capital ships are much more maneuverable than Star Wars capital ships, the Rebels use mostly fighters to attack that are far more maneuverable than almost all Star Trek ships. This would negate much of Star Trek's advantage here.
1.11.1.25.2.1. Con: This is assuming that Rebel fighters were effective against Federation ships, which there is no evidence of and considerable doubt about.
1.11.1.25.3. Con: Rebel ships, in general, mount more weapons then Federation ships, covering more arcs, so their lack of manoeuvrability does not severely limit their firepower or ability to engage targets.
1.11.1.25.4. Pro: There are examples of computer assisted attacks and defensive patterns, and even automated targeting, engagement and firing sequences.
1.11.1.25.4.1. Con: The Federation's reliance on computer assistance means that any disruption to their systems, such as an ion torpedo attack that successfully disabled a Star Destroyer in Rogue One, would leave them combat ineffective until their systems were restored.
1.11.1.25.4.2. Pro: An example of this would be when the emergency command hologram \(ECH\) commanded Voyager's computer to target the enemy vessel's engines, which the ship was able to do with automation and without crew input or manual targeting.
1.11.1.25.4.3. Pro: Such as when the doctor and the emergency medical hologram MkII ordered the Prometheus computer to engage the Romulans with a specific, and highly effective, attack pattern when there were no crew aboard. The ship was able to do so with no more than vague verbal commands from the inexperienced holograms.
1.11.1.25.5. Pro: Weapon tracking, while rarely mentioned directly, it was apparent that weapons needed to track their targets. Manoeuvring the ship to aid in tracking and aligning targets for lock is another factor to consider in evasive manoeuvring.
1.11.1.25.6. Pro: The increased speed and manoeuvrability allows them to dictate engagement range and time, which would play a huge role in combat, especially with comparative weapon ranges. If the enemy cannot hit you, they cannot damage you.
1.11.1.25.7. Pro: The increased manoeuvrability allows them to shield weakened shields and damaged areas far easier than on more lumbering capital vessels, giving them a chance to reduce damage taken, as well as repair damaged sections and recharge shields.
1.11.1.25.8. Pro: The increased manoeuvrability allows them to target enemy weak spots, such as areas with fewer weapons, weakened shields, already damaged sections, structural weak points, engines etc. with far more efficiency and accuracy to bring their weapons to bear and concentrate their firepower on such areas.
1.11.1.25.9. Pro: The Federation ships' increased manoeuvrability allows them to evade more fire. As Rebels capital ships main weapons are ion cannons and turbolasers \(which has previously been established as plasma based weapons\), they would be slower than light, making them easier to evade.
1.11.1.25.9.1. Pro: Conversely, Star Wars Rebel capital vessels would be too slow and lumbering, with a lack of manoeuvrability to effective evade weapons fire from Federation ships, whose weaponry tends to be longer ranged and faster.
1.11.1.25.10. Pro: Though they have fewer weapon systems, Federation weapon systems have better arcs than their Rebel counterparts. The increased manoeuvrability allows them to bring more weapons to bear on a target as well as bring their strongest weapons, such as torpedoes, phaser lances and cannons, which might otherwise not have such great arc coverage, to bear more easily.
1.11.1.25.10.1. Pro: This would also allow them to pick the arc of attack and thus choose to attack Rebels in their weakest arcs, whether that be shields, or the arcs with least weapon coverage, exposing them to less fire.
1.11.1.25.10.2. Pro: This also allows for better fleet co-ordination and fire patterns with over-lapping arcs of fire and kill zones which would make Federation ships and fleets more deadly and efficient then the Rebels, both on attack and in defence.
1.11.1.26. Pro: The Federation are capable of science that can substantially alter or even destroy stellar bodies.
1.11.1.26.1. Con: Space battles are about destroying ships, not stars.
1.11.1.26.1.1. Con: A supernova \(the collapse and explosion of a massive star. Smaller stars just go Nova, or collapse, depending on mass and method\) is a vastly destructive force that can obliterate Starships easily. If the enemy is not expecting them and can't outrun them, you can easily destroy an entire fleet at once.
1.11.1.26.2. Pro: Using the same science it is possible to alter ships to destroy them if shields aren't in the way - in the same way a rebel base could be entirely eradicated using a supernova or terraforming device.
1.11.1.26.2.1. Pro: [The Genesis device](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Genesis_Device) Could be used to eradicate the entire Rebel Fleet, however it is unclear about what effect this would have through shields.
1.11.1.26.2.2. Pro: Starfleet has the technology to [create novas](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Tolian_Soran).
1.11.1.26.3. Pro: The Genesis device, although somewhat unstable, is supposed to turn a barren world into a living one. However, this is not all it can do. As seen in Star Trek II and III, it actually rearranges the molecules of a Starship and a nebula into a planet. This is a technical and scientific feat beyond anything in Star Wars.
1.11.1.26.3.1. Pro: As Spock points out: It has always historically been easier to Destroy than to Create.

That actually makes this feat doubly impressive and Trumps ANY Star Wars feat
1.11.1.26.3.2. Pro: If the Federation were willing to use the Genesis Device as a weapon, they could mass produce it. A single device would destroy the Death Star and tun it into a micro planet.

Further more, given the destructive wave and potential of it, fired into a Fleet, no Star Wars vessel would be able to outrun the blast wave, or calculate a hyperspace jump in time.

Outcome: Destruction of Rebel Fleet in a single shot.
1.11.1.26.3.2.1. Con: The Federation is manifestly unwilling to use the Genesis Device as a weapon, since they have never done so despite numerous existential threats that could possibly be defeated with it.
1.11.1.26.3.2.1.1. Con: However, the very fact they COULD use it, is a step beyond the abilities of Anyone in the Star Wars universe, especially the Rebellion
1.11.1.26.4. Pro: The Federation has the ability to destroy whole stars.
1.11.1.26.4.1. Pro: Both Soren in 'Star Trek: Generations' and the Founder posing as Bashir In 'DS9: By Infernos light' attempt to destroy stars \(in fact, Soren does so successfully\) and send them supernova, regardless of their size. Soren uses trilithium and the changeling uses trilithium and protomatter based devices, which we are assured would have worked if not stopped. As the Federation know how these devices work, it is obvious they could make them if they wished.
1.11.1.26.5. Pro: The Federation have the ability to re-ignite dead stars. This is explored \(unsuccessfully\) in a 'The Next Generation' episode, and successfully in 'Deep Space 9: Second Sight'. This is an ability beyond anything the Rebels \(or Empire\) demonstrate on screen.
1.11.1.27. Con: Rebel communication technology is superior to the Federations. The Rebels have real-time holographic technological communication to anywhere in the galaxy. The Federation has very good and very fast communication, but it is not real time and does suffer some delay and thus cannot compete with the Rebels. This would give the Rebels a coordination edge.
1.11.1.27.1. Con: We see real time [holographic communication](https://youtu.be/Ewjh0lPRQGI?t=1m50s) demonstrated in Star Trek Discovery multiple times. Not only is it real time, the quality is far superior to the Rebel's.
1.11.1.28. Pro: The Federation has access to [replicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicator_\(Star_Trek\)) which enables a uniquely flexible use of resources.
1.11.1.28.1. Pro: Replicators can replace supply chains, agricultural infrastructure, shipyards, polluting industries like mining, terraforming operations, banking, shipping, and many of the other vulnerabilities of the Republic. Replicators, a small team of scientists or engineers, and a warp core for power can be dropped inside of an asteroid to create an entire industrialized fortress behind enemy lines that Republic ships won't notice if it isn't on an established hyperspace lane.
1.11.1.28.2. Con: Rebel spies were able to steal plans to the Death Star \(Rogue One\), and it would be easier to steal the plans for the replicator, evening out the advantage.
1.11.1.28.2.1. Con: -> See 1.11.1.14.1.
1.11.1.28.2.2. Con: There are multiple types of replicator, and only [industrial replicators](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Industrial_replicator) would be useful to potentially even-out an advantage.
1.11.1.28.2.3. Con: In the unlikely event that they could even figure out how the technology works, that does not imply they would have the resources and construction capabilities to produce a replicator.
1.11.1.28.2.4. Con: In the unlikely event that they could create a replicator, they couldn't necessarily power it. Starfleet uses antimatter power generation and even they had to ration use on Voyager. Mere fusion power is unlikely to permit replicators to be practical for the Rebels.
1.11.1.29. Pro: The Starfleet has faster than light target tracking and have starships capable to fire photon, quantum and transphasic torpedo's at faster than light speeds.
1.11.1.29.1. Pro: The Federation standard MkII photon torpedoes with a dry mass of 248kg, at warp speed would have a devastating impact on any target \(without a warhead/explosive component\). E=mc² means that the kinetic impact would be absolutely devastating in its own right.
1.11.1.29.1.1. Pro: Not Star Trek, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpyK0uZVd2c), demonstrates aptly why accelerating a 248Kg object to even .1c \(never mind .25c, .9c or c it's self\) is going to HURT.

They're talking about a 5kg object at .013c.  You do the maths.
1.11.1.29.2. Pro: Federation ships can also use their [phasers for targeting](http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/inconsistencies/treknology-weapons.htm) and [engaging at Warp.](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Phaser) A phaser beam can be delivered at warp speeds due to an annular confinement beam jacket and other advances in subspace technology. This only applies to beams and not pulses however.
1.11.1.30. Pro: The Federation has acquired cloaking technology. The Empire has cloaking technology as well, but there is no on-screen evidence that the Rebel Alliance has cloaking tech.
1.11.1.30.1. Pro: Star Trek Cloaking technology is far beyond anything the Rebels have or have the ability to overcome.
1.11.1.30.2. Con: The Federation is prohibited from using Cloaking Devices, by the treaty of Algeron. The one exception is the Defiant \(DS9\). As a single exception, this would not be a decisive factor against the Rebels, especially as cloaking tactics and sneak attacks are not Federation tactics.
1.11.1.30.2.1. Con: The Treaty of Algeron has not prevented the Federation from experimenting with cloaking technology when the mood suits them, such as in the TNG episode The Pegasus, Star Trek: Insurrection, DS9 episode Call to Arms, as well as the Defiant using the cloaking device in the Alpha Quadrant on numerous occasions.
1.11.1.30.2.2. Pro: Even when the Defiant has a cloaking device and using it in a similar way to Klingons or Romulans would prove advantageous, the Federation \(Starfleet\) crew do not do so, or appear to even think of doing so, as it's against their morals and standard tactics.
1.11.1.30.2.3. Con: The Federation also consists of the Klingon Empire who have no compunction about using cloaking devices and associated tactics. Furthermore, this is the same Federation that cloaked an entire minefield to protect the entrance to the wormhole.
1.11.1.30.2.3.1. Con: The Klingons are Allied to the Federation, not a part of it. As such their support cannot be counted upon or guaranteed.
1.11.1.30.2.4. Con: The Treaty of Algeron was dissolved in 2410, allowing the Federation to develop cloaking technology and cloaked ships, such as the Galaxy X-class ships and its offspring as well as the brand new Avenger-class battle cruiser, all of which utilize cloaking technologies.
1.11.1.30.2.4.1. Con: That s Star Trek Online timeline and is NOT considered Official by Paramount or CBC.

At the point of bringing in any novel or spin off into it of semi-canonical origin, you'd open the door to all Star Wars Legends work
1.11.1.30.3. Con: When the Milennium Falcon evaded a Star Destroyer in The Empire Strikes Back, an Imperial officer said in disbelief "No ship that small has a cloaking device". Not "the Rebels do not have cloaking devices". The implication is that the Falcon's disappearance from their scanners is surprising because of its size, not because cloaking is inherently unlikely.
1.11.1.30.3.1. Con: However, no on screen examples of cloaking devices in use exist. This suggest they are rare. It also gives no evidence that they have or know any such way to counter cloaking devices.
1.11.1.31. Pro: Starfleet has access to transporter technology. Since the Rebel Alliance does not have this technology, it is fair to say they cannot defend against it. This makes it easy for the Federation to slip aboard Rebel ships for espionage, intel gathering, or assassinations.
1.11.1.31.1. Pro: While the rebels might be able to defend against some transporter technology, the ability to transport supplies and personnel from surface to orbit in seconds is a vast advantage in terms of logistics and tactical mobilization.
1.11.1.31.1.1. Pro: [Near-warp transport](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Near-warp_transport) can also radically decrease supply times. This also means that Starfleet will be wasting fewer resources to the process of supplying their ships as compared to the rebels.
1.11.1.31.2. Con: Federation transporter technology appears to be reliable only under the best of circumstances, even when accidents happen. Things that can adversely impact transporter operations include: electromagnetic radiation, electromagnetic force fields, severe weather, dense metals, defensive shields, exotic radiation, natural minerals \(all occurred at some point during the shows\). In a combat scenario, with heavy jamming/electronic interference/shielding, transporter utility is suspect.
1.11.1.31.2.1. Con: Severe or Fatal accidents are very rare by the time of the original Series and almost completely unheard of by the Time of the Next Generation onwards.
1.11.1.31.2.2. Con: Transporters are regularly employed during Battles in several episodes and movies. The biggest concern is having to drop the shields to Transport, thus making them more vulnerable to fire, as well as the target also having to have downed/weakened shields to allow transport. Jamming, interference, weapons fire and even relative movement and velocities seem to have very little effect in this situations and circumstances.
1.11.1.31.3. Pro: The Rebel X-Wing fighters, etc. would be useless as the pilots and droids could be transported out of them, causing them to become worthless in a fight.
1.11.1.31.3.1. Con: Rebel fighters, like capital ships, are shielded. There is no indication that Federation Transporters would be able to pierce or circumvent Rebel Fighters' shields.
1.11.1.31.4. Con: In the Star Trek universe, individuals are unable to transport through a force field. Star Wars universe tech would therefore be adequate to defeat this advantage.
1.11.1.31.4.1. Con: In Star Wars, shuttle bay shields have to be down in order to launch ships. Depending on the orientation of the Federation ship in regards to the shuttlebay, the Federation would be able to transport to anywhere in the ship.
1.11.1.31.4.1.1. Con: While this is true, the Starfleet vessel is dropping its shields during transport. The vulnerability is likely equal threat to both sides as the unshielded Starfleet vessel would be pummeled by fighter weapons.
1.11.1.31.4.1.1.1. Con: Star Wars weapons have a maximum range of 5-10k km, transporters have a standard range of 40k km, with cargo transporters having a theoretical range almost double this. The developments in the Kelvin universe blow these [ranges](http://www.st-v-sw.net/STSW-WeaponRange.html) further out of the water, with Scotty transporting light years.
1.11.1.31.4.1.1.2. Con: The ability to transport is what makes the threat not equal. Both ships would be as vulnerable to cannon fire and torpedoes, but only the Rebel ship would be vulnerable to transport attacks.
1.11.1.31.4.1.1.3. Con: Starfleet has the advantage of knowing exactly when their shields would be down and for how long. The Rebels would need to know which direction they should attack from, and the precise moment that they would be able to attack.
1.11.1.31.4.1.2. Con: There is no evidence this is true. If it was, the Millennium Falcon would not have escaped the Death Star.
1.11.1.31.4.2. Pro: Transporters are additionally defeated by electrical transformer substations \(TNG S4 Ep80 "Legacy"\), two kilometers of granite \(same source; interestingly they've done two kilometers of rock and dirt at other times, suggesting density is the problem\), and an especially strong planetary magnetic field \(TNG S4 Ep83 "Final Mission"\).
1.11.1.31.5. Pro: Federation technology has demonstrated the ability to transport entire shuttlecraft moving at high impulse speed. That is overly sufficient to simply transport fighters themselves out of the battle. They do not even have to be rematerialized, could just be diverted to the anti-matter supply to be vaporized.
1.11.1.31.5.1. Con: This would be an impractical battle tactic. A phaser sweep could target more fighters than a transporter could, with the benefit of keeping shields up.
1.11.1.31.6. Pro: Transporter technology enables the Federation to be much more effective at boarding operations than the Rebels.
1.11.1.31.6.1. Pro: Transporters permit boarding crews to re-arm; if a Rebel raiding party is out of ammo, they have to scavenge. Starfleet can beam over energy packs or even heavier duty weaponry should the task require a loadout change mid-mission.
1.11.1.31.6.2. Pro: Any boarding party would reach a rebel vessel within seconds without loss.
1.11.1.31.6.2.1. Pro: With later technological developments, the boarding parties of the Federation can even alter their appearance, board any enemy vessel within seconds and extract with intel.
1.11.1.31.6.3. Pro: Transporters make raiding crews more efficient. While the Rebels would need pilots, gunners, and other support personnel to transport boarding or assault troops, transporters allow sending over only the combat personnel.
1.11.1.31.7. Con: Teleporters are notorious for not working when trying to teleport through dense surfaces or interference. During the episode "Hero Worship" a boy was behind several layers of metal and shields and was unable to be transported. It is easy to see a direct comparison to Star Wars ships.
1.11.1.31.7.1. Con: There is no solid evidence that durasteel is more dense than granite.
1.11.1.31.7.1.1. Pro: Even if the premise that durasteel is denser than granite is accepted \(and give it three times the density\), then 10 meters of durasteel would still be only 30 metres of granite \(and there's no evidence the hulls are even this thick\). As the claim points out, it took 1km of granite to stop a transporter beam. It would require 300+ meters of durasteel in order for it to stop a transporter beam.
1.11.1.31.7.2. Con: It has already been established that active shields and certain metals disrupt and prohibit the use of transporters. Even certain radiation and energy emissions can interfere with a lock. However, it does not seem to be the case for the metals that primarily compose starship hulls, nor do even two armoured hulls appear to have any ability to disrupt a transporter beam, or else ship-to-ship beaming would be impossible in Star Trek.
1.11.1.31.8. Pro: There are [examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transporter_\(Star_Trek\)) of weapons being transported this way, for example photon torpedoes and grenades.
1.11.1.31.8.1. Pro: A Federation ship could zip by an Alliance vessel in Warp, beam a photon torpedo onto the Alliance vessel's bridge, and commit the grand mother of all drive-bys. Other comments have illustrated aspects of the Federation's technological advantages, but the specific application of these technologies in tandem- the ability to transport matter, the ability to transport matter while traveling at warp speed, and the incredible destructive power of photon torpedos- could end this fight before it starts
1.11.2. Con: The Rebel Alliance and its ships are designed specifically for battle. In contrast, many Federation ships serve, first and foremost, other purposes, for example space exploration.
1.11.2.1. Pro: The Corellian Corvette, MC80, and EF76 Nebulon-B frigate are just a few examples of purpose built warships. Everything the Rebel Alliance could get their hands on was put to use...out of necessity. Additionally, the Rebel Alliance captured and regularly made use of Imperial ships, including Star Destroyers.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: The [CR-90 Corellian Corvette](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/CR90_corvette) was designed as a fast consular ship, not a dedicated warship.
1.11.2.1.2. Con: Mon Cal MC80 Star Cruisers started life as luxury passenger liners that were converted and retro-fitted into Cruisers. They were not designed from the ground up as Combat Vessels.
1.11.2.1.3. Con: There are no canon examples of the Rebel Alliance capturing or using Star Destroyers.
1.11.2.2. Pro: Star Wars ships operate much like our conventional surface fleet combatants, using turrets & launchers. Star Trek ships operate like submarines, and when a system goes out, it's out. When a turret is disabled or destroyed, there's 12 more firing.
1.11.2.2.1. Con: This is not entirely accurate as many Federation ships carry multiple independent phaser banks and arrays, not to mention separate photon torpedo tubes. There are many examples of individual banks or arrays being out or launchers, but others functioning.
1.11.2.2.1.1. Con: However, despite the famed redundancy of Federation ships, there are considerably more examples of hits knocking out all the weapons at once, something which based on their design, should be impossible, but must be accepted as fact due to the frequency with which it happens.
1.11.2.2.1.2. Pro: Case in point: A Galaxy Class Starship has 14 unrelated phaser array strips and 3 independent Photon Torpedo tubes.
1.11.2.3. Pro: The [USS Defiant](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Defiant_class) was the first purpose built warship to be designed by Star Fleet in a large part of the organization's history. Warships are primarily designed to fight; exploration vessels \(even heavily armed ones\) are not. The vast majority of Star Fleet ships are the latter: armed science and exploration vessels, not warships.
1.11.2.3.1. Con: And yet they are comparable to hostile, militant and aggressive threat species warships, able to hold their own against and even consistently and reliably defeat such dedicated warships.
1.11.2.4. Con: This does not exclude the possibility that the Starfleet's ships are superior in battle, nevertheless.
1.11.2.4.1. Con: It doesn't exclude the possibility by itself, but Starfleet's ships are not superior in battle, nonetheless.  Consider the destruction of asteroids by Star Destroyers in Empire Strikes Back: [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8qK8ZzsstQ)

And the performance of seismic charges in Attack of the Clones: [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erFcYsC6JaY)

To TNG Season 7, Episode 12, "The Pegasus," where Riker states that it would take the Enterprise D's entire payload of photon torpedoes to accomplish a similar feat.
1.11.2.4.1.1. Con: In EPII the asteroids are mostly not much bigger than the fighters themselves \(which are one of the smallest fighters too!\) and the larger ones appear to be hollow and can be flown through. The power output to destroy them is not that great, and even the shock wave is not that impressive. \(no more so than modern military conventional thermo-nuclear devices\)
1.11.2.4.1.2. Con: The Enterprise normally carries 250 Torpedoes. But we do not know what their current load is. Additionally, the asteroid is quite big \(the enterprise can fly through it\). One can assume that he is talking about obliterating the asteroid, not destroying it, thus to ensure all evidence is completely destroyed. That would require more than to simply destroy it.
1.11.2.4.1.2.1. Con: We don't need to assume he meant obliterating the asteroid.  All they needed to do was compromise the hull integrity of the Pegasus and the warp core breach would do the rest.
1.11.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Again, no guarantee. Not every ship destroyed suffers a catastrophic warp core breech \(oddly\). There's plenty of evidence to support this.

Given the stakes involved \(potential inter-stellar war\), guaranteed obliteration is clearly preferred
1.11.2.4.1.2.2. Pro: The Asteroid in "The Pegasus" is significantly larger than any the Star Destroyers Target
1.11.2.4.1.2.2.1. Pro: A conservative estimate puts the asteroid at 6km in diameter. This is contrasted with a high end estimate of 50 meters for the ones the Star Destroyers destroy. This is a difference of over 120x times size and mass!
1.11.2.4.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: 50 meters is the absolute largest asteroid a Star Destroyer is seen destroying \(and that's ignoring perspective and angle to calculate size to give a generous upper maximum size\). There are examples of 100-200m asteroids that Star Destroyers do not destroy and are instead seen to destroy them \(and if a 1600m ship is destroyed by a 150m asteroid it does not speak well to the targeting ability or durability\).
1.11.2.4.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: This is a very conservative estimate as based on the size of the chasm estimates of 15-30km have been put forward. It is known that the Enterprise had to fly through over 3000m of solid rock and there was still room behind it, so a minimum of 4km just for the fissure. The fissures account for less than 10% of the size of the asteroid.
1.11.2.4.1.2.2.1.3. Con: As with the 'Empire Strikes Back', there is no data on what the asteroid is made of. We are forced to assume by the colouration and visual effects it is simple nickle/iron, or possibly even loose rock.
1.11.2.5. Pro: All rebel ships have noticeably more 'hardpoints' allowing for more guns to fire at the same time. The firing rate of the guns on rebel ships is noticeably higher as well, with laser turrets being able to rain down fire continuously on federation ships.
1.11.2.5.1. Con: Continuous fire is irrelevant if Rebel ships can't get into range. [Starfleet ships fire from significantly further away](http://st-v-sw.net/STSW-WeaponRange.html), are nimble enough to avoid slow-moving weapons fire, and can [fire from faster than light speeds](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Corbomite_Maneuver_\(episode\))--the rebel gunners won't know where to shoot if they can't see their target.
1.11.2.5.2. Con: Starfleet sensors allow precision targeting. Each individual shot is more effective because it can be pinpointed at sensitive targets like shield generators and engines. Because Starfleet ships are as agile as fighters, they'll be able to reach these sensitive targets at range, easily.
1.11.2.5.3. Con: Star Fleet Phasers show equal or greater ability to rapid fire than Star Wars scale capital ship weaponry.
1.11.2.5.4. Con: Lasers may be as ineffective as rain against shielded Starfleet vessels, given that Starfleet vessels are reported to be functionally immune to laser fire.
1.11.2.6. Con: Federation ships were designed to be flexible--they could have a loadout for exploration, but they could just as easily be retooled for combat rapidly. This was done extensively during the Dominion War; they were intentionally created to be outfitted for any task needed.
1.11.2.7. Con: Rebel ships are civilian constructs converted over to warships. They do not have built from the ground up warships, just purpose built fighters and bombers.
1.11.2.7.1. Con: They do have built up warships. Corellian Gunships, late war MC90 Mon Calamari Cruisers, plus the captured Star Destroyers and Super Star Destroyers.
1.11.2.7.1.1. Con: MC90's were actually built after the Rebellion era. And there are no canonical captured Star Destroyers or Super Star Destroyers during the Rebellion era.
1.11.2.7.2. Con: The Rebel Alliance inventory was [quite large and varied](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Rebel_Alliance_starship_classes). While a great number of ships were civilian vessels converted to warships, a significant number were also specifically built for conflict. Ships from the times of the Old Republic/Clone Wars, up to Capital Ships taken/captured from the Imperial Fleet.
1.11.2.7.3. Con: Re-purposing civilian vessels appears to be a common enough activity within the Star Wars universe \(owing to relatively large numbers of independent and semi-independent organizations\) that this may be a design consideration for starships in general. That they also appear to be used effectively throughout extended periods in multiple conflicts reinforces this assertion.
1.11.2.7.4. Pro: The majority of civilian Star Wars vessels start off armed and the platforms for their weapons, armor and shielding provide a starting point for larger and more powerful weapons and armament.
1.11.2.8. Con: Though Federation vessels are first and foremost built as explorers and scientific vessels, they are heavily defended and well shielded to protect their crews on that mission against the unknowns they may face. By most other peoples reckonings, the Constitution and Excelsior class were heavy cruisers and the Galaxy class is a battleship, equal to or more than a match for other, more aggressive races front line combat vessels.
1.11.2.8.1. Pro: This also says nothing for the Sovereign, a "heavy Explorer" \(In actual fact a Dreadnought or Heavy Assault Cruiser\), The Defiant \(A dedicated Warship\), and The Prometheus \(another dedicated Warship\).
1.11.3. Pro: The Rebel Alliance has fewer capital ships than the Federation. By concentrating firepower, the Federation can destroy the Rebel Alliance's capital ships before the Rebel Alliance's fighters can destroy the Federation's ships.
1.12. Pro: The Rebels wouldn't be nearly as outnumbered as they were against the Empire, an opponent which they managed to beat.
1.12.1. Pro: The Federation is generally peaceful and so we see numerous instances where they are easily imperilled by relatively small aggressors with fairly minor power differentials, such as the Dominion, periodically the Romulans or Klingons.
1.12.1.1. Con: The Dominion were a much larger governmental body with a much higher level of technology--they were neither a small aggressor, nor an aggressor with a minor power differential.
1.12.1.2. Con: The Romulans are [more advanced](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Romulan_technology) than the Federation, and are neither small, nor qualify as a minor power differential.
1.12.1.2.1. Con: The Romulans are only more advanced in certain areas. They lag behind in several other key areas.
1.12.2. Pro: As noted, no concrete numbers for the size of the [Rebel Fleet](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Alliance_Fleet). However, during the time span of the entire conflict, the Rebellion suffered constant losses, many times grievous ones. However, they always managed to not only make up for the losses but continue to advance into open warfare. The reason is simple: The number of [star systems](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_galaxy) available to draw resources from \([numbers](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/9525/how-many-planets-were-there-in-the-empire-at-the-time-of-a-new-hope) will vary according to source of information\).
1.12.3. Pro: Warfare with large scale opponents like the Dominion invariably involved direct support \(coalition operations\) from the Klingon and Romulan Empires, two other major regional \(and separate\) powers. They also had significant support from the Bajoran insurgency and "supra-normal" powers \(the wormhole entities\). The Federation could not have tackled the Dominion by itself.
1.12.3.1. Pro: The Battle of Wolf 359 showcases the limited operational assets the Federation keeps on hand for the most part. Star Fleet lost a mere 39 ships, which severely constrained their [ability to handle another incursion](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Wolf_359). It is only after years of conflict \(and with substantial support from the Klingon and Romulan Empires\) that the Federation would be able to field ships in large numbers.
1.12.3.1.1. Con: And yet, a mere handful of months into the Dominion War, Starfleet is able to field 600 plus ships on its own, without assistance, drawn from elements of 3 other of its own fleets.
1.12.3.1.1.1. Pro: It is suggested that these fleets are between 800 and 1400 vessels strong, and that the Federation had between 12 and 14 of these fleets during the Dominion War.
1.12.3.1.2. Con: And yet the Battle of Earth \(From Star Trek: First Contact\), a similar situation and engagement, does not represent significant losses to the Federation, coming as it does either just before or during the Dominion war.
1.12.3.1.3. Con: The Romulans did not enter the Dominion War until mid-way through it. As the War only lasted two years, this is hardly significant support from them to allow the Federation to mobilise. Following the timeline of the conflict, the Federation handled the majority of the fighting during the beginning and early war, and also at the end of it.
1.12.3.2. Con: The large majority of the Dominion war was fought without the aid of either the Klingons or Romulans. Romulans were brought in during the episode "inter arma enim silent legels" just before the final battle of the Dominion war.
1.12.3.2.1. Con: The Federation and Klingons fought since the start, though the Federation bore the brunt of the fighting, with Klingon support arriving en-mass from Season 6 Episode 6 on-wards. The Romulans also joined the war late in Season 6 \(in the Episode "In the Pale Moonlight"\) after a gambit to get them to participate. Dialogue suggests they engaged in several major battles and offensives.
1.12.3.2.1.1. Pro: Further to this, After the second battle of Chin'toka and the Breen's entry into the war on the side of the Cardassian-Dominion Alliance, for several months, the Klingons were the only force able to effectively fight.
1.12.4. Con: The Rebels had a a unity of purpose and right on its side where the Empire was held together with fear which doesn't make their military as cohesive as a dedicated as an idealistically based Starfleet. This comparison is therefore not applicable.
1.12.4.1. Con: The argument that the Rebels would lack resolve when facing a more morally benevolent opponent is entirely irrelevant to a discussion of the numerical advantages/disadvantages between the Rebellion and the Federation.
1.12.5. Con: The rebels were able to defeat the Empire using guerilla warfare, a tactic they would not be able to use as effectively against the Federation. As an internal struggle, the rebels were able to use the rigid structure and setup of the Empire to defeat them, often with lone agents like Solo & Skywalker, where such a battle would hardly scratch the federation. The Rebels biggest war was changing minds so the Empire lost its support and rebellions became more common- not happening in the Federation.
1.12.5.1. Con: The Federation is, by and large, run by Starfleet. It's not a stretch to imagine that Federation citizens who aren't in Starfleet may empathize with a rebel group whose goal is to establish a democratic government in place of a militaristic dictatorship.
1.12.6. Con: Starfleet makes up for its low crew numbers with significant amounts of miniaturization and automation. Where the rebel alliance has squads of gunners, Starfleet vessels have a tactical officer and computers. Starfleet does more, with less.
1.12.7. Pro: The Alliance was able to build and maintain a galaxy-wide insurgency, while the Federation is confined to fewer systems more or less in one quadrant. The Rebels were major underdogs against an Empire that spanned from the Core to the Outer Rim, but would be fighting on much more even terms against the Federation.
1.12.7.1. Con: The Federation is in fact spread across 2 quadrants \(Alpha and Beta\) and is about between 8,000 and 10,000 light years across. It is made up of over [150 member species and worlds](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets) and several thousand worlds.
1.12.7.1.1. Con: The line between the Alpha and Beta quadrants runs through Federation territory, but this does not mean they control significant fractions of both quadrants. The Prime Meridian runs through Britain, but it could not be seriously claimed that the United Kingdom comprises large fractions of both the Eastern and Western hemispheres \(imperial holdings notwithstanding\). A Federation 10,000 light years across would be ungovernable with warp speeds as they are depicted in Voyager.
1.12.7.2. Con: The Rebellion was supported by rogue arms manufacturers, shipbuilders and engineers, such as Incom, as well as species crushed and oppressed under the Empire and who remembered the freedoms and equality of the Republic. There are few private ship builders and arms manufacturers in the Federation, so they would not have the resources there.
1.12.7.2.1. Pro: As the Federation is a united post-scarcity utopian society, the Rebels would not find the unrest or support there that they did in their own galaxy. This would diminish their resources and manpower and make replacements difficult.
1.12.7.2.2. Pro: As many races supported the Rebellion due to the oppressive nature of the Empire, they may not support it against the open and inclusive Federation where aliens are treated as equals. As such, support for the Rebellion might quickly evaporate or dry up.
1.12.8. Con: There are no concrete numbers for the size of the [Rebel fleet](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Alliance_Fleet), though the 'Battle of Endor' represented a vast majority of their ships and power. Generous estimates would put this around 1500 at maximum, including fighters. The Federation on the other hand has commissioned over 75,000 vessels \(though that is over the course of its lifetime\). At the height of the 'Dominion War' it could field between 10,000-15,000 vessels.
1.12.8.1. Con: This would still be less than the 25,000 Star Destroyer's fielded by the Imperial navy. This figure does not include fighters or other forms of support craft or other capital class vessels, just Star Destroyers.
1.12.8.1.1. Con: While it is true that the Imperial navy is larger than Starfleet, it is also more spread out \(it covers a whole 100,000-125,000 light year galaxy\). The Federation is only spread out over 8,000-10,000 light years. As such the relative concentration and density of Starfleet vessels is greater, which could mean the Rebels would be outnumbered and overwhelmed in any skirmish or battle.
1.12.8.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.11.1.5.
1.12.8.1.1.2. Con: Federation worlds are not depicted having large garrisons of starships on defensive deployment.  Starfleet has at times been unable to muster more than a few dozen vessels to meet existential threats to the Federation, such as against the Borg at Wolf 359.
1.12.8.1.1.2.1. Con: In soft canon, and supported by visual and verbal evidence in Deep Space 9, all Federation words have shields, defensive satellites and ground based phaser emplacements. Some also have space stations/docks and the like.

Many also have a defence grid or drones \(such as the Neptune, Saturn and Mars Defence lines/grids in the Sol System\)
1.12.8.1.1.2.2. Con: During the Dominion War, Vulcan was defended by the 7th Fleet numbering at times anywhere between 200 and 600 vessels.
1.12.8.1.1.2.3. Con: When the Breen Attacked Earth, the Federation were able to mobilise a defensive fleet to drive off the attack fairly quickly, before significant damage was done.
1.12.9. Con: The Empire, being a totalitarian government, had large amounts of it's fleet tied down in occupying countless systems, while the Federation's systems being there willingly and often having starbases in defense, is able to deploy larger portions of it's fleet, and has been seen engaging in battles that [dwarf](https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Cardassia) the number of ships of ships deployed in Endor, many times over.
1.12.10. Con: The Federation is used to fighting and beating foes both smaller \([Cardassia](https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Federation-Cardassian_War)\) and [bigger](https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Dominion_War) than it, and is more used to war than the Empire was, the Galaxy Far Far Away having no major wars between the Clone War and Rebellion, and few fleet battles in the latter.
1.13. Pro: Star Wars vessels, both the Empire's and the Rebels', tend to appear more solid and durable than Star Trek ships, particularly the Federation's/Starfleet's.
1.13.1. Con: In many Star Trek episodes, Federation ships take repeated attacks without ever even losing their shields. It therefore appears that Federation ships are fairly durable.
1.13.1.1. Con: It is very rare to see the Enterprise engaged in a full fleet combat action, meaning the number of examples where they may be taking focused fire from multiple heavy warships is limited.
1.13.2. Pro: Hodo's kamikaze attack in The Last Jedi cut through multiple vessels of the First Order fleet.
1.13.3. Pro: The Rebel Alliance has a greater array of capital ships. They are suited to different roles. They are heavily armored for combat. They have multiple gun emplacements for fighting ship-to-ship.
1.13.3.1. Con: As an ad hoc force, they very rarely put out consistent ship designs. They would have a hard time mass producing ships of the same caliber.
1.13.3.2. Con: Actually the Rebellion does not have a greater array of capital ships. Star Fleet is referenced as having over 70 Classes of vessel in service by the time of Next Gen/Deep space 9/voyager. Pretty much all of them are capital class. This is comparable to the number of designs fielded by the Rebellion.
1.13.3.3. Con: The Federation force is produced from a series of planets that are governed by the same government. They are more cohesive and have no need to run from the empire. They are able to produce more ships more quickly.
1.13.4. Pro: Star Wars vessels tend to be [vastly larger](https://dirkloechel.deviantart.com/art/Size-Comparison-Science-Fiction-Spaceships-398790051) than ships in Star Trek and consequently more heavily armoured, armed \(larger surface area allows them to mount more weapons\) and durable, able to take significantly more damage.
1.13.4.1. Pro: Larger size will often mean more structure to absorb impact and damage. There is in essence, more to damage before they stop working, and more to destroy in general, making them tougher and more durable.
1.13.4.2. Con: Size alone does not determine durability. An example of this would be the Titanic.
1.13.4.3. Con: Also, Star Trek ships may be smaller \(though even this is debatable\), but this does not make them less tough or durable. Many are protected by Structural Integrity Fields \(SIFs\) that vastly increase and enhance their hull structure, strength and integrity, making them far more durable than their size would indicate.
1.13.4.4. Pro: Larger ships also have more room \(more surface area\) for more weapon emplacements, allowing Star Wars ships to be more heavily armed.
1.13.4.5. Pro: Larger ships can mount more and heavier armour, or may be larger precisely because they mount more solid and thicker armour.
1.13.4.6. Con: -> See 1.5.3.8.1.1.
1.13.4.7. Con: Larger does not necessarily mean better.
1.13.4.7.1. Pro: Factors like modern technology and - in the case of the Rebel Alliance - the force by far outweigh size as an advantage.
1.13.4.7.1.1. Pro: Even Yoda supports this point: "Judge me by my size do you? And well you should not!"
1.13.4.7.1.1.1. Con: It's true that size is not a determining factor in a fight. That, however, is not enough of a mitigating factor to mean that a dreadnought would be outclassed by a single ship with a much smaller tonnage/armament.
1.13.4.7.1.1.1.1. Con: A WW1 era dreadnought or even a WW2 era Battleship would have a higher tonnage and higher armament than a modern Destroyer. Yet a single modern destroyer would be able to run circles and destroy either, or even a small fleet of such crfat with minimal risk.
1.13.4.7.1.1.2. Con: Yoda was referring directly to the power of the force and the irrelevance of size to that power. He was not suggesting that size was irrelevant in all things.
1.13.4.7.2. Pro: There are many examples of large-scale, supposedly unbeatable or unsinkable war machines that did not fare well in practice, from the Titanic \(largest ship in the World at the time and billed as unsinkable, and it still sank\) to the IJS Yamato \(which had one of the highest displacements and largest guns of any ship...and it was next to useless in the course of the war.\) and the Nazi's Maus tank \(which was so large as to be useless\).
1.13.4.7.2.1. Con: The Titanic was not a warship and as was not armored as such. The repeated comparisons between larger Rebel Warships and the Titanic are therefore misleading and irrelevant.
1.13.4.7.2.1.1. Con: Most Rebel Mon Cal Ships were luxury liners before being converted to Warships.
1.13.4.7.2.1.1.1. Pro: There are examples of these style of conversions in WW2 for troop ships and aircraft carriers \(and even one battlecruiser\). Without exception, they did not fare well.
1.13.4.7.2.1.2. Con: The Titanic was however the largest ship of its time and was billed as unsinkable. A claim that proved false.
1.13.4.7.2.2. Con: While the IJS Yamato and the Maus Tank may have been too large to be effective, the capital ships fielded by the Rebel Alliance are already proven as combat effective.
1.13.4.7.2.2.1. Con: They are combat effective in their own universe, using their own tactics. There is no evidence they would be effective in a different paradigm. It'e like comparing WW1 era Dreadnoughts to Modern day Cruisers and both using the tactics of their time.
1.13.4.7.3. Pro: Star Trek has several examples of smaller ships defeating much lager ones. From the Doomsday Machine, to V`Ger, to the Borg, to the Scimitar and even the Nerrada. Thus the size of Star Wars ships is immaterial.
1.13.4.7.3.1. Pro: Even Galaxy Class starships \(aprox 600m in length\) were a match for Romulan D'deredix Warbirds \(1,200m in length - that's only 400m shorter than an Imperial Class Star Destroyer\).
1.13.4.7.4. Pro: Larger vessels make for bigger targets and navigate slowly; they therefore tend to be easier to hit.
1.13.4.7.4.1. Con: Larger war vessels tend to be far more heavily armed and armored than smaller vessels, allowing them to largely negate many attacks while having the firepower necessary to deal heavy damage in return.
1.13.4.7.4.1.1. Con: Larger vessels must sacrifice armor and structural integrity to accommodate the larger crew, including gunners. Starfleet vessels make use of automation, which can permit reinforcing otherwise weak areas.
1.13.4.7.4.2. Pro: In essence, they wallow. They're just bigger targets. This seems doubly true for Star Wars ones, which are lumbering behemoths that have trouble maneuvering or making sudden course changes, much like WW2 era ocean going vessels.
1.13.4.7.4.3. Pro: They'd be easy targets for the Federation who enjoy superior range and accuracy. It would be like shooting very large fish in a very small barrel.
1.13.4.7.4.4. Pro: Larger vessels tend to be less agile and have less ability to dodge and consequently get hit more.
1.13.4.8. Con: The Rebels may have ships that look bigger and more sturdy - but the Federation has weapons that can cause vastly more damage than the weapons the Rebel fleet was built to deal with.
1.13.4.8.1. Con: [Stardestroyer.net](http://www.stardestroyer.net/tlc/Power/) calculates the power of a single shot from a Star Destroyer's weaponry as at least 60MgT, given that it vaporizes a 40m diameter rock in The Empire Strikes Back. Arguably even higher values are defensible given the movie canon. Hence a single shot from a Star Wars universe capital ship is at least equivalent to a Star Trek photon torpedo, and Star Wars capital ships appear to be able to fire and/or survive sustained barrages of hundreds of such shots.
1.13.4.8.1.1. Pro: Since Imperial and Rebel technology is the same, we have seen on screen one shot vaporization of asteroids by Turbolaser. In comparison, when faced with a decent sized asteroid, the Enterprise admitted it would almost take their entire complement of photon torpedos to destroy it.
1.13.4.8.1.1.1. Con: The size of an asteroid is meaningless to a weapon's ability to destroy it if we don't know its composition. If the Star Wars asteroid is just rock, and the Star Trek asteroid is full of dense and exotic materials, we have no means to gauge relative weapons power.
1.13.4.8.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.11.2.4.1.2.
1.13.4.8.1.1.3. Con: This uses a single example of a large asteroid, while ignoring other examples of them destroying asteroids in single shots. This is seen in 'Star Trek the Motion Picture', 'The Next Generation' and in 'Voyager'. Thus there is more precedent against this claim than for it. The one asteroid in question is significantly larger and has extenuating circumstances.
1.13.4.8.1.1.3.1. Pro: The Asteroid in the episode in question \("The Pegasus"\) is significantly larger than a Galaxy class starship, and has a low end estimate of 3000m in diameter, though likely more, up to 15km in size. This is significantly bigger than the asteroid in Episode V.
1.13.4.8.1.1.3.2. Pro: The Enterprise wanted to completely vaporise a much larger Asteroid, to destroy a ship that may be hidden within, to destroy a small device on that ship so that no trace or evidence of such a device, be it in form of wreckage or debris was identifiable, much less salvageable. This required a much more thorough standard.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4. Pro: The power calculated for Turbolasers to achieve that is generously calculated [here](http://www.stardestroyer.net/tlc/Power/).
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1. Con: A lot of that work is by Dr.Saxton, who is known to be biased. Further, he also claims starfighter blasts in the Kiloton range. Given that Obi-Wan is not instantly vaporised in EPII, his figures are clearly and demonstrably wrong.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.1. Con: The Turbolaser Commentaries were in fact written by Brian Young, not Dr. Saxton.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: The Commentaries are, yes, but they reference work by Dr. Saxton, an Astrophysicist \(of questionable repute\) who wrote the Incredible Cross Sections guide of Episode II. They tend to take his word as Gospel, even in the Commentaries and he is mentioned in there more than once.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2. Con: Variable yields explain Obi-Wan's survival quite nicely. The same weapons that didn't vaporize the landing platform the Jedi was standing on \(which was owned by Fett's employers, giving him motive not to destroy it\), inflicted withering damage to celestial bodies later in the same film. In order to impose an upper limit, the weapons need to be shown attempting something quantifiable and failing.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: This is pure speculation with no evidence to back it up, on screen \(in any movie to date\) or in the novelisation. As such, it is hardly a substantial claim.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: If that is true then the constituent rocks of Geonosis' planetary ring would be less durable than the human body, which is implausible.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Planetary Rings tend to be made up of small, hollow rocks, dust conglomerates and small ice chunks. So a reasonable hypothesis would be that its planetary ring is less durable than the human body.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.2. Con: The same weapons are a credible threat to starfighters and smaller starships. It is misleading to conclude that their performance on the landing platform is an upper limit on their power.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Porkins X-Wing essentially falls apart after a minor graze at the battle of Yavin. TIE fighters \(which are un-shielded\) have a durability not much greater than wet paper, if on screen evidence is to be believed, and are routinely destroyed by things that even other craft shrug off. Based on that evidence, Star Wars fighters are not very well built, maintained or held together and come apart rather easily.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: This now presumes that the human body is more durable than a functioning spacecraft capable of reentry, which is implausible.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Seen during the [Battle of Yavin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WBG2rJZGW8): 3:41 Porkins X-Wing doesn't even take a direct hit. It takes micro damage from being too close to an explosion. Over the next 6 seconds it disintegrates and explodes for no apparent, obvious reason.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.3. Pro: What can bee seen during the [Battle of Yavin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WBG2rJZGW8): 6:57 - A Y-Wing takes a single hit from Vaders TIE and explodes. This shows fragile construction. Likewise, there is no Kt yield blast. At 7:13, another Y-Wing blows up from a single shot. At 7:20, a single laser shot blows off an engine nacelle \(with shields equalised front and aft\) from a Y-Wing, causing it to catastrophically explode.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.3. Pro: This entire argument is based on an assumption, an extra variable that has been added, with no on screen evidence to support, let alone prove. Variables such as "variable settings" and "yields" have been added when there is no indication this is the case or even possible in Star Wars. There is no one on screen flicking switches or sliders, or inputting into a console, just firing. Scientifically, using Occam's razor, the extra, unsupported variable should be removed.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: Occam's/Ockham's razor is more of a philosophical principle than it is scientific method. Suppose there exist two explanations for an occurrence. In this case the simpler one is usually better. Another way of saying it is that the more assumptions you have to make, the more unlikely an explanation is.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con: Occam's Razor states that the simplest explanation that accounts for all the facts is the most likely to be true. The same weapons are shown to have drastically disparate effects at different times, therefore they must be variable. Further, it is known that variable firepower exists, as it is seen during the 'Battle of Hoth' when General Veers orders his AT-AT to destroy the shield generator with "maximum firepower.".
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Based on this there are two possible conclusions: Either laser cannons are weak and do not produce Kiloton blasts, or they have variable power settings which aren't seen and would have to be inferred. Based on Occam's Razor we should remove the one with the extra, unproven variable. Therefore, the scientific approach would be the hypothesis that laser cannons are weak and do not produce Kiloton Blasts.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Neither, this is a false dichotomy which leaves out several key facts. Slave I's primary cannons exhibit anti-personnel firepower on one occasion and anti-vehicle firepower on other occasions. General Veers orders his walker to employ maximum firepower, implying that up to that point it was not using maximum firepower. The Death Star having variable firepower for the superlaser is a major plot point in Rogue One.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.3.1.1.2. Con: It is not "known" that there are variable yields. It is assumed or inferred from a statement. An inference is not a fact.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.3.2. Con: Variable power settings are seen during the [Battle of Hoth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dMPeKgPROM#t=2m03s).
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.3.2.1. Con: Imperial AT-AT walkers have 2 separate sets of armaments. They're repeatedly seen only firing one during the battle. When they fire at "maximum" firepower, it seems to be the second one firing, or possibly both at once. This is an alternate take that also fits the facts, rather than inventing a magical, scaling firepower which isn't shown.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con: The AT-AT's are [depicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Mj7c1DEQ00#t=2m55s) firing both the chin and cheek guns throughout the battle, often at the same time.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: It doesn't happen at the same time, at the same target, until that moment.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: [Examine the shot carefully.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Mj7c1DEQ00#t=9m06s)  General Veers' walker uses the cheek guns to shoot a fleeing Rebel soldier, and then uses the chin guns and not the cheek guns to shoot the generator immediately thereafter. Further, the bolts from the shots against the generator are noticeably larger and brighter than shots fired from the same cannons moments earlier; contrast the first link to [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Mj7c1DEQ00#t=8m58s)
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.2.2. Con: While the argument for variable settings and yields is logical and would make others things fit better, it has zero evidence presented to back it up. In fact, it is an extra variable, added or suggested with no basis, no evidence and no supporting facts. It seems more to be suggested to support an argument that otherwise can't be supported or substantiated. As such, it is not a very scientific argument.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.3. Pro: This is further supported by the lack of effect on a near unshielded starfighter \(Luke's\) in EpIV. Vaders TIE, opens fire from close range and hits R2D2, who certainly isn't vaporised in a cataclysmic kiloton explosion.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: And Luke had already sustained several hits weakening his rear deflectors by that time, so there's almost nothing to dissipate the power of the shot.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: There is no indication his rear deflectors were down before that point.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: During [The Battle of Yavin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WBG2rJZGW8): 3:01 - Luke strafes the Death Star surface \(those are clearly not Kt explosions\), 3:04-3:08 - Luke flies through the wash from his own strafing run and they are concerned for him. He claims he's a little cooked but otherwise okay. 4:03 - Luke again strafes the Death Star. Still no Kt blasts \(even the internal damage of a gun crew being blasted is not consistent with one\). 4:28 - An X-wing takes a single hit from a TIE and explodes.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: 5:10 - Luke takes a hit to one of his engines. His craft does to explode, though does take damage. We can infer his shields absorbed most of the impact. 8:49 - An X-Wing takes multiple impacts from Vaders laser cannons \(3 or 4\) and explodes, though started to come apart after the first hit. 8:58 - Another X-Wing takes a hit, possibly 2 from a TIE fighter and explodes. 9:30 - Red leader losses his starboard engine from a single shot \(9:37 he takes another hit and ploughs into the Death Star.\).
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: At 10:33 - Luke's stabiliser breaks loose, just from flying, likely by the earlier damage. 10:52 - Wedge takes a TIE Fighter laser hit, he losses his aft shields and is forced to pull out. 11:24 - Biggs takes a single hit from Vaders TIE and explodes. 12:31 - R2D2 is hit by a laser blast \(visually from no more than 20-30 meters\) that shows none of the glow of earlier shots of passing through shields. From this we can infer that Luke's shields were weakened or non-existent at this point.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.1.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Although R2D2 is hit by lasers shown capable of destroying star fighters and he is "lost", he is not destroyed and is later able to be repaired. Hardly likely from a Kt powered blast.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.2. Con: Using the example of [Star destroyer's](https://youtu.be/fSs8gu3NZBo) orbital bombardment of Lothal. Given the size of the explosions and blast radius, turbolasers do not appear to be anywhere more powerful than modern artillery. Additionally, there appeared to have been very little structural damage to the surrounding rock and landscape, despite what might be described as a withering assault.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.20.7.7.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.2.2. Con: Tarkin ordered Thrawn to take the Rebel leadership on Atollon alive, which Thrawn observed would make his job much more difficult. Taking prisoners precludes simply reducing the Rebel base through bombardment.
1.13.4.8.1.1.4.2.3. Con: It's uncertain whether or not it was actually a Star Destroyer taking potshots at Kanan in that scene, as there was at least one Arquitens class light corvette present at the battle, [seen here at 1:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYpTFakE_bQ#t=1m22s). He was some distance from the base, and the rest of the fire was concentrated on the shield; targeting him was deliberate and not something a Star Destroyer's main batteries were likely wasted on.
1.13.4.8.1.1.5. Con: The sizes and densities given for the asteroids are assumptions and vary wildly. Star Wars sites such as this [one](http://www.stardestroyer.net/tlc/Power/) say: 20+m asteroids, volume of asteroid = 4188.79 m³, mass of asteroid = 32,965,759 kg, heat Capacity of iron = 447 J/kg·K. In contrast, Star Trek sites such as this [one](http://www.st-v-sw.net/STSWaster.html) claim: 5-25m asteroids \(definitely smaller than 40m\), volume of asteroid = 5625 m³, mass of asteroid = 515,090 kg. This suggests they might be rock and silicon dioxide rather than iron.
1.13.4.8.1.1.6. Con: The asteroids destroyed by the Star Destroyers appear to be very small on screen, and as we don't know whether they are metal, silicate or carbon based asteroids any kind of power level calculation would be meaningless.
1.13.4.8.1.1.6.1. Con: By appearance and coloration, they're likely nickel-iron.
1.13.4.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.20.
1.13.4.8.3. Pro: The Rebels managed to destroy Imperial vessels that were larger, better armoured and better armed than theirs. There is no reason why the Federation could not do the same towards the Rebellion.
1.13.5. Pro: A lot of this extra durability comes from their solid construction \(they look solid, with simple, straight forward geometric shapes and designs and little empty space or weak points, where as Star Trek has obvious structural weaknesses\) and heavy looking armour.
1.13.5.1. Pro: Star Wars ships tend to be of more durable and sensible construction, with solid, sturdy looks and no obvious weak points \(the Nebulon B frigate being a notable exception\). Star Trek ships however tend to have obviously exposed structural weak points and look less solid and more flimsy.
1.13.5.1.1. Con: Despite their fragile looks, Starfleet Vessels tend to be more solidly and well constructed than they look, as well as have significant back up from their structural integrity field. In Star Trek: Generations, The saucer section of a Galaxy class starship survives a near unpowered and barely controlled crash landing on a planet largely structurally intact despite ploughing a several km long trail in the ground.
1.13.5.1.1.1. Pro: In Star Trek: Nemesis a Sovereign Class rams another, much larger ship. Although there is significant damage to the Saucer section, it still survives the Ram in much better condition than one would expect from its size, shape and design. There are similar instances of such ramming and crash landings with other ships.
1.13.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Federation are overly cautious with a back-up to a back-up to a back-up. Their shields are self-regenerating, and their structural integrity fields and inertial dampening fields have [triple redundancy](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=po7406HGXQYC&lpg=PA25&ots=74bWE_57uX&dq=are%20there%20triple%20redundant%20systems%20on%20starfleet%20vessels&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false), allowing a ship that would ordinarily be a 400,000km micro meteor cloud to remain relatively in one piece.
1.13.5.1.1.2. Con: In Deep Space Nine, the USS Odyssey was incapable of withstanding a ram from a much smaller Jem'Hadar attack ship.
1.13.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Additionally, Klingon Battlecruisers \(dedicated warships\) was destroyed by a Jem'Hadar fighter that also rammed it. Demonstrating the materials in common use in the ST setting. These ships, [even "hardier" Klingon Warships,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owP8rodvksA) cannot withstand a significant physical impact by relatively small vessels. In Rogue One, a [Sphrna-class corvette](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sphyrna-class_corvette) purposely [rammed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9ul6xBFE7I) a \(Victory class?\) Star Destroyer. Nether ship blew up because of this.
1.13.5.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The Jem Hadar "[Fighter](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Jem%27Hadar_fighter)" is generally accepted as being 110 meters \(360 feet\) long, though sizes from 45 meters \(150 feet\) to 150 meters \(500 feet\). This makes it aproximately the same size as a B'rel class Bird of Prey.
1.13.5.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Speed is a factor in a ram too. We do not know how fast the Jem Hadar vessels were going. Given that combat in Star Trek usually happens at Impulse speeds between 0.25c and 0.95c, \(significantly faster than anything in real space in Star Wars\), they would have a lot more force behind them simply due to F=MA.
1.13.5.1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Also, given the Klingon ships could not dodge and the range of sensors in Star Trek, it is also likely the Jem Hadar ships were moving at a very high rate of speed \(which would make sense if they were ramming to inflict the most damage as possible\). These were deliberate suicide attacks, whereas the ram in Rogue One was designed to shunt and nudge. The purposes and desired outcomes were vastly different.
1.13.5.1.1.2.1.3. Con: And Yet the Enterprise-E survived a head to head Ram with with much larger Scimitar in Star Trek: Nemesis
1.13.5.1.1.2.1.4. Con: TIE Fighters, Rebel Fighters, Star Destroyers and the Executor \(A Super Star Destroyer\) prove substantially less resilient to Ramming in all 3 of the Original Trilogy movies.
1.13.5.1.1.2.2. Con: The Ram itself didn't destroy the USS Odyssey, rather, fortuitous collateral damage did when wreckage from the deflector array struck the warp nacelle, creating an unavoidable Warp Core overload and explosion.
1.13.5.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: This is a known weakness of the Galaxy Class design that contributed to the loss of at least 4 of that Class in a little under 9 years of operational service \(not to mention was demonstrated in a temporal causality loop over and over and over again\)
1.13.5.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con: If the Rebels learnt of this weakness, they could target Ramming attacks, or even conventional attacks there to cripple Galaxy Class Star ships quickly.
1.13.5.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: This is on the condition they could get in range to target them, or ram them, or even hit them at all given their poor accuracy and the difference in sizes. Also, Star Wars gunnery, with but a single example, which seems more lucky then planned, does not show this level of accuracy and called shots.
1.13.5.1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: This weakness only applies to Galaxy Class vessels and is fixed in later designs. It would be less effective against any other Starfleet Vessel
1.13.6. Con: While they may look more solid and durable, there is no direct evidence to support the idea or notion that they actually are. It is just that, an impression caused by aesthetics. There are many examples of the durability of Starfleet and other species vessels in Star Trek.
1.13.7. Con: -> See 1.13.4.8.
1.13.8. Con: Star Trek ships employ structural integrity fields giving them exceptional durability for their size and appearance. There are instances of ships falling from orbit essentially [intact](https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Ship_\(episode\)).
1.13.8.1. Con: The example given was of a vessel from the [Gamma Quadrant](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Jem%27Hadar_fighter) and shouldn't be taken as reference for Federation or Alpha Quadrant capabilities.
1.13.8.1.1. Con: Equal opportunities to study Alpha Quadrant vessels would be the Enterprise-D's saucer section crash on Veridian III, The Defiant's ability to go deep into a Gas Giant in "Starship Down" or the examples of the Enterprise and the Vengeance in the Kelvin timeline in Into Darkness.
1.13.9. Pro: Imperial and Rebel vessels are made up of Titanium \(A real metal\) and Titanium Alloys \(unknown what makes the alloy with titanium\). Others were made with Durasteel and Duralloy \(both fictional\) and Ferroceramics \(so Iron ceramics, which would have heat resistant properties - appropriate as they're used for atmospherics\). Stormtrooper Armour was made of Plasteel. 
TIE fighters specifically are made of Titanium while X-Wings are made of Titanium Alloys.
1.13.9.1. Pro: X-Wings are between 33% and 120% more durable than TIE Fighters.
1.13.9.1.1. Con: Alloys of Iron are still [stronger](https://owlcation.com/stem/What-is-the-Strongest-Metal-The-Hardest-Metals-Known-to-Man) than alloys of titanium. The only reason to use a titanium alloy over an Iron alloy is to reduce weight. Using Titanium means that a X-wing will have reduced stress tolerances vs space and atmosphere flight and resisting G-force, which probably goes some way to explaining why they are so slow compared to Starfleet vessels.
1.13.9.1.2. Con: The melting point of Titanium is 1,668 °C \(1941 Kelvin\), with a boiling point 3,287 °C \(3560 Kelvin\). Even if we assume the X-wings alloy is 150% stronger \(when at best it should be 120%\) that would create values of 2502 °C \(2775 Kelvin\) and 4930.5 °C \(5204 Kelvin, rounded up\).
1.13.9.1.2.1. Con: Starfleet vessels and Hulls however have shown the capability to withstand Temperatures in the several thousands of Kelvins. A Galaxy Class vessel had a rating of up to[12,000 °Celsius](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Celsius) \(12,273 Kelvin\).
1.13.9.1.2.1.1. Pro: The external temperature of a Federation shuttlecraft, utilizing metaphasic shielding, could tolerate radiation levels that approach ten thousand rads and temperatures of 1.9 million kelvin, while maintaining an internal cabin temperature of 21 °C. \(TNG: "Suspicions"\)
1.13.9.1.2.1.2. Pro: Starfleet vessels use a mix of the following for [Hull construction](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Hull): Duranium, Electroceramic, Kelindide, Magnesite, Monotanium, Neutronium, Polyduranide alloy, Tetraburnium, Tritanium, Trititanium, Victurium, all of which are somewhat fictional.
1.13.9.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Titanium was used in the construction of early starships, such as the Phoenix.
1.13.9.1.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.1.6.1.1.2.
1.13.9.1.2.2. Con: Whilst a nice theory, this is incorrect. While most Alloys are stronger than the base metals involved, due to their irregular lattice, this also reduces their covalent bond meaning they have a [lower melting point](https://www.factmonster.com/dk/encyclopedia/science-and-technology/alloys). It's why most metals in Star Trek aren't alloys. This also explains why Star Wars ships break up easily, their hulls are designed to handle G-Force, concussive damage and the like, not energy weapons, thats what shields are for.
1.13.9.2. Pro: Some craft were made up of ["Matrix" armour](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hull/Legends) which was a strong material often used in the construction of starship hulls. It was more durable than durasteel and was better able to withstand blaster fire than titanium.
1.14. Pro: The Federation depends on science and technology whereas the Rebels depends upon the Force. Since the Force does not need to follow the laws of physics and nature, so long as "the Force is with" the Rebels, they have the advantage.
1.14.1. Con: The vast majority of rebels are not Force sensitive.
1.14.1.1. Pro: The Force isn't with anyone. The Force is. The saying "May the Force be with You" is meant as a salutation, [akin to a wish for good luck](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/May_the_Force_be_with_you). Given official Imperial policy/views concerning the Force, and in particular, it's users i.e Jedi, the statement is also made as a sign of defiance. But thinking that the Force favors anyone is to completely misunderstand it's nature.
1.14.2. Con: The Rebel Alliance needed a bailout from Obi-Wan to keep Luke from misfiring his proton torpedos to destroy the Death Star \(Episode IV\), which makes the Force look like a joke.
1.14.3. Pro: The Force makes up the very fabric of the Star Wars universe while seemingly not being something present in the Star Trek Universe. This makes it likely that the Force would not be with the Federation, or something which the Federation would be able to utilize, but would be with/utilized by the Rebels during battle.
1.14.3.1. Con: The scope of the engagement takes place where both sides meet. "Universal" constants, like the Force either exist in that place, and accessible to all, or it doesn't. All of the esoteric particles of Star Trek, i.e. tachyonic *mumble mumble , would similarly exist in the same way and accessible to the Rebel Alliance. These are "environmental" factors...the stage where the play is being performed, but not the play itself. There's no way to arbitrarily separate them beyond "magic".
1.14.3.2. Con: The Rebels could only ever use the Force to a limited extent as the great Jedi purge killed a massive percent of Force sensitives. It may be true that there're people who unknowingly wield the force however without training there's going to be very little impact.
1.14.4. Pro: The Rebel Alliance has Force users included among their ranks and also have the force guiding them and enabling them.
1.14.4.1. Con: Force sensitives were almost all wiped out by the empire, it is an extremely broad assumption to state that there is any quantity of force sensitives in the rebel forces that would constitute an influence.
1.14.4.1.1. Con: The high quality of the Force users who are fighting for the Rebellion could compensate for its low numbers.
1.14.4.1.1.1. Con: The Force users themselves would not have been trained by Jedi of any calibre \(with the exemption of Luke who of which was not trained as a Jedi while he was with the Alliance\).
1.14.4.1.1.1.1. Con: [Ezra Bridger](http://starwarsrebels.wikia.com/wiki/Ezra_Bridger) was a trained Force user and lightsaber duelist who fought for the Rebels.
1.14.4.2. Pro: [Leia](https://www.starwars.com/news/strong-in-my-family-exploring-leias-unique-relationship-with-the-force) has the Force and might be aided by it even if she doesn't actively use it.
1.14.4.3. Pro: [Han's](https://www.inverse.com/article/20877-pablo-hidalgo-han-solo-force-sensitive-twitter-ben-kenobi) superb flying skills is an indicator that he might be in tune with the Force without being aware of it.
1.14.4.3.1. Con: Luke or Ben would likely have sensed if Han was Force sensitive.
1.14.4.3.1.1. Con: The ability for Force users to sense other Force sensitives is inconsistent in the Star Wars universe.
1.14.4.4. Con: With only a handful of Jedi masters or knights even present in the universe, it would be unlikely anyone would be able to have been trained sufficiently by these Jedi in a way that would influence the conflict to a great extent.
1.14.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.14.4.1.1.1.1.
1.14.5. Pro: Jedi knights historically fight on the Rebel's side. Their use and control of the force is fully unmatched on the Federation side, adding a clear advantage to the Rebels.
1.14.5.1. Con: The Jedi ally themselves with the "good side." Because the Federation is a peaceful utopia, it's reasonable to think the Jedi would fight on the Federation's side.
1.14.5.2. Con: The Jedi were essentially wiped out, and the handful of singular assets don't represent much of an advantage.
1.14.6. Con: There are few force-sensitive individuals in the rebellion, and they're completely nullified by the large damage radius of wide beam phaser settings, and targeted, pinpoint orbital striking.
1.14.7. Con: The Force is useful only to those born with an abnormally high concentration of Mido-Chlorians which are some type of measurable bacteria or cell in the body. The Federation being a highly scientific organization with a very large medical community could come up with a way to negate the effects of the Mido-Chlorians.
1.14.7.1. Con: This would theoretically either result from genetic engineering, which is illegal in the Federation, or be caused by biogenic weapons which are [also illegal](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Bio-mimetic_gel).
1.14.8. Con: If the Federation are not a part of the Force, then it is highly debatable that the Force would have much effect or even be able to effect them at all, or be able to influence the battle in any meaningful way.
1.14.9. Con: Except they have been shown to lose, for example at Hoth, and how they took heavy casualties at Scarrif. Additionally the Jedi were essentially wiped out by non Force users in Episodes II and III. Clearly even when the Force with you, you can lose.
1.14.9.1. Con: The federation has been shown to lose as well. Neither side goes undefeated in the battles.
1.14.9.2. Pro: Vader says during [Ep.IV](http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-A-New-Hope.html): "Obi Wan is here. The Force is with him". Vader later defeats Obi Wan \(Obi wan let himself be defeated, but it is not clear he would have won anyway\). The Force being with someone clearly does not make them invulnerable.
1.14.9.2.1. Con: Obi-Wan is not defeated but disappear right before Vader's strike would've landed. Instead he transcends from his physical being into the Force.
1.14.9.3. Con: The Force was not necessarily with the Rebels during those losses.
1.14.9.3.1. Pro: The Force doesn't have to follow the laws of physics existing in reality. This advantage affects all factions in Star Wars, not just the Rebels. Therefore one cannot conclude with certainty, that the Rebels were defeated by their enemy's superior technology. It might as well have been that same Force.
1.14.9.3.2. Con: This in theory, means that the Force could favour the Federation as well. If it's accepted that the Force also exists there for it to be used against them, then it could be used for them too, whether they know it or not.
1.14.9.3.2.1. Con: The Force, stated as the thing which binds the Star Wars universe together, intervenes to ensure balance within its own universe. As the Federation is not a part of that universe, it is likely that the Force would not be 'willing', and possibly, not able to intervene on behalf of the Federation.
1.14.9.3.2.1.1. Pro: The fact that the presence of the Federation would likely be disruptive to the Star Wars universe, means that the Force would most likely 'consider' the Federation to be a threat to the balance of the Force.
1.14.9.3.2.1.2. Con: It's plausible that the Force would not be able to have an impact on anything outside of the Star Wars universe. If the combat doesn't take place completely within the Star Wars universe, the Force might not be able to affect the outcome of the battle.
1.14.10. Pro: The [statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nSpDEFO3tY) by Darth Vader that "the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force" could be seen as support for the idea that the Rebels would beat the Federation, even if the Federation's technology is superior.
1.14.10.1. Pro: The Force is a powerful ally, and certainly more reliable than a Q. The Q are more powerful than the Force, but not part of the Federation.
1.14.10.1.1. Pro: The Q are directly opposed to this sort of bloodshed.
1.14.10.1.1.1. Con: While this is true, there is an example of a Q civil war, and also that Q was willing to use threats, force and even death in "Encounter at Farpoint" and "Hide and Q". They may take umbrage to Force users feeling that they are superior and make an example of them. The Q after all do have huge ego's.
1.14.10.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Q do not have to kill or commit bloodshed to render people harmless. Freezing, transportation, shrinking, striping of powers, time manipulation, and transformation/transfiguration are all viable options which the Q has been shown to use.
1.14.10.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Examples of this are throwing the Enterprise in the path of the Borg "Q who", or shrinking the Calamarian into the palm of his hand in "Deja Q", and then blowing them away.
1.14.10.1.2. Pro: Though a particular one does have a fascination with humans and the Federation, they tend to be unreliable, self-centred, arrogant, and capricious, so cannot be relied on for help or support.
1.14.10.2. Con: The Force is created by Midichlorians. As such the Federation could potentially synthesise it technologically \(similar to borg nano-probes or re-creating nervous systems\) to either give themselves Force powers, or else come up with a counter to the Midichlorians \(such as the aforementioned nano-probes\).
1.14.10.2.1. Con: The Midichlorians are a semi-religious phenomenon in a fantasy world and we have no idea or description of them which is thorough and detailed enough to conclude that the Federation would be able to replicate or attack them using nano-probes or any other technology known to them for that matter.
1.14.10.2.1.1. Con: Midichlorians are measured in the blood. If they can be measured, they can be known. A simple ST transport would capture the measurable midis, thus being able to study them, replicate them, and destroy them.
1.14.10.2.1.1.1. Con: There's little reason to expect the Starfleet to be able to catch someone with midichlorians in them, identify the midichlorians, replicate them, and then finally, manage to create an effective method of using midichlorians against the Rebels, in time for them to use it before the combat is over.
1.14.10.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Additionally, assuming that the Starfleet would be able to create an effective use of midichlorians in combat against the rebels, they'd still have to find a way to effectively implement that method in battle.
1.14.10.2.2. Con: Midichlorians are also living symbiotic entities.  The federation would potentially find ethical issues with manipulating biological entities like that.
1.14.10.2.3. Pro: A similar precedent would be found in Voyager, where they found ways to counter-act Borg nano-probes, or synthesise Q-based weapons.
1.14.10.3. Con: Whilst in the hands of the Sith, the Force could prove to be a powerful weapon, it is unlikely to be so in the hands of Luke Skywalker. Whilst the scope of Skywalkers powers are shown quiet clearly in Star Wars, his powers tend to be on a more personal 1-1 level due to his desire to avoid the altogether more deadly dark side powers, such as Force Lightning and Telekinetic Kill.
1.14.10.3.1. Con: Luke's force sensitivity gives him the ability to destroy a planet-killing battle station. Those powers could be applied to thwart the Federation.
1.14.10.3.1.1. Pro: Luke disabled his targeting computer, and instead used the force to fire and guide a torpedo into the Death Star's exhaust port.
1.14.10.3.1.2. Con: Luke's connection to the force allows him to target the exhaust port that the Rebellions sub standard targeting sensors couldn't. Whilst in single combat against a target with such a vulnerability this is a great asset, it is unclear how it would help against a Galaxy class starship, with no such weakness, that could vaporize him an hour before he got into range to fire his torpedo.
1.14.10.4. Con: The Federation have several Telepathic, Empathic and Psionically gifted races such the Vulcans, Betazoids  and Ulians who are just as capable as Luke Skywalker.
1.14.10.4.1. Con: Telepathy is not the same as predicting the future, or moving things with your mind \(that's telekinesis\).

None of the Federations telepathic races are ANYWHERE near as powerful or versatile as a Jedi.
1.14.10.4.2. Con: Force-sensitive members of the Rebel Alliance, too, can utilize skills such as Telekinesis. Individuals such as Yoda have demonstrated this in the movies.
1.14.10.5. Con: While just basic Jedi training can improve a pilot's fight \(as shown by Skywalker himself during Battle of Yavin\), one or few force users are no significant power to give any edge during a war. The Clone Wars proved the Jedi can be great leaders, but still mediocre warriors.
1.14.10.5.1. Con: That is exactly the opposite of what the Clone Wars proved. The Jedi were great warriors in that war but lousy strategists. Their downfall was not their inability in combat but their failure to see the big picture and realise who and why orchestrated that war. The Rebel Alliance however is not ruled by the Jedi Council.
1.14.10.6. Con: This is just a rehashing of "the pen is mightier than the sword." It is not a literal statement--force users created the Death Star, so even their faith in the force alone wasn't absolute.
1.14.10.7. Pro: There are actually quite a few [Jedi](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/121928/which-jedi-have-served-in-the-rebellion) \(or at least Force-sensitive\) individuals who can/do assist the Rebels. Given the number of Jedi/Force-sensitives, it is likely "the Force would be with" the Rebels. It has been shown that when this is the case, those with the Force on their side will ultimately prevail.
1.14.10.7.1. Con: But they can suffer horrendous casualties and set backs doing so:
Scariff
Hoth
The Jedi Massacre...
1.14.10.7.1.1. Pro: The Rebellion took a decisive defeat at Hoth, despite the presence of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. 

The Force did not help them. And they were fighting Non-force users for the battle.
1.14.10.7.2. Con: Actually, the Force is neutral. It strives for Balance. It does not pick sides.

Therefore there is no on screen evidence to suggest it would help the rebels.
1.14.10.7.2.1. Con: A Starfleet attack on the Rebel fleet would be an imbalance to the force, much like the Empire was an imbalance.
1.14.10.7.2.1.1. Con: The Empire was not an imbalance to or of the force, the Sith who controlled the Empire \(Palpatine and Vader\) were.
1.14.10.8. Con: The Star Wars Galaxy is saturated and infused with Midichlorians, the thing that creates the force. If the battle took place in the Star Trek Galaxy, there is a very high likelihood the force would not function, rendering force users moot.
1.14.10.8.1. Con: The assumptions in the description of this battle assume that anything that requires aspects of the star wars or star trek universe does work.
1.14.10.9. Con: Force users can be killed just like any body else, and frequently are, even by Non Force Users.
1.14.10.9.1. Pro: A vast majority of Jedi were taken out by Mooks \(non force-sensitive clone troopers to be precise\) with blasters. The clone troopers had no Force assistance. This shows that even with their Force abilities of Foresight, Deflection and advanced reaction times, Jedi can be overcome by non-Force sensitive forces.
1.14.10.10. Con: -> See 1.14.10.9.1.
1.14.10.11. Con: It is unlikely that the Rebellion would have help from Luke, as Luke is seldom present.
1.14.11. Con: The Force isn't necessarily reliable, for example because one can imagine situations in which simply no individual capable of utilizing the Force is present in a battle.
1.14.11.1. Con: The force exists in all living beings, therefore it would still be present.
1.14.11.2. Con: Luke Skywalker is apart of the rebel alliance and is force sensitive as is Leia Organa \(not that she knows\). Many of the characters in the new canon are also force sensitive however i am not so familiar with it so it would be hard for me to use specific names.
1.14.11.3. Pro: Force sensitives in this conflict cannot consciously utilise the force in battle to any effect and any canonically strong force users would not be deployed as a first response.
1.14.11.3.1. Con: Luke [Skywalker](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Skywalker_\(family\)) is one of the Strongest Jedi's to ever exist, showing substantial force sensitivity and ability.
1.14.11.3.1.1. Con: Luke was either untrained as a jedi or had left the Rebel Alliance to train with Yoda at the time as in star wars he had adopted the Jedi agenda of which coincided with stopping the injustice and Sith aspect of the empire instead of just supporting The Rebellion.
1.14.12. Con: The Federation has [telepaths](https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Betazoid) and empaths. Abilities not dissimilar to the force are not an unknown to them.
1.15. Con: The Federation has a much more stable and prosperous economy.
1.15.1. Pro: The Federation has a larger fleet than the Rebels and significantly greater shipbuilding capacity. When on war footing, the Federation could absorb heavy casualties without significantly impacting their long term ability to launch offenses, losing hundreds of ships on [multiple](https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Tyra_system) [occasions](https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Chin%27toka). Judging by their ship registry numbers of the [USS Defiant](https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/USS_Defiant_\(2370\)) and [USS Sao Paulo/Defiant II](https://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/USS_Defiant_\(2375\)), building 1,628 ships with registry numbers \(which doesn't include shuttles  and the like\) within a 5 year period.
1.15.2. Pro: During a long engagement, the federation can draw upon the means of production of hundreds of technologically advanced worlds to sustain the fight. The rebels are reliant on equipment scraped together at the fringes of society.
1.15.3. Pro: In addition, the Federation can rely on supply lines and other helpful infrastructure. The Rebel Alliance, as an insurgent force, has no access to comparable means.
1.15.4. Pro: The economic stability and prosperity are further solidified by a stable political system even among the outlying planets, with little rivalry and dissent that could fuel revolutionary feelings.
1.15.5. Pro: Even if the Star Wars universe were more prosperous, the Rebel Alliance would hardly be able to utilize these resources. It is, after all, a group of rebels.
1.15.5.1. Con: The Rebel Alliance can count on the support of many highly industrialized worlds like Mon Calamari, Sullust, and Chandrila, many of which are capable of building and supporting sizable fleets of capital ships. Mon Calamari alone contributed dozens of miles-long cruisers all larger than the biggest Federation warship.
1.15.5.1.1. Con: This would depend highly on where the conflict took place. If in the Star Trek Universe/Galaxy \(ours\) then those worlds support would count for little.
1.15.5.1.1.1. Pro: If the battle were to occur in the Star Wars universe, no industrial planet could openly support the alliance by simply giving away ships. To do so would be to invite the wrath of the Empire with a Garrison on your world at best and almost extinction and slavery in all likelihood.
1.15.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The majority of rebellion ships were stolen or acquired through duplicity rather than open support by planetary governments.
1.15.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: All the MC-80 starcruisers in the rebellion represent the entirety of this vehicle as they evacuated from Mon Cal just prior to the arrival of the Empire. Mon Cal is now an Imperial controlled world under command by the Quarrens rather than the Mon Cal.
1.15.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The entire Rebel fleet that was capable of combat was seen at Endor, hardly dozens of MC-80 ships.
1.15.5.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Half a dozen cruisers can be seen [from the bridge of the Executor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZigWFyK2o#t=6m35s) before its destruction, after two had already been destroyed by the Death Star. Another that couldn't be one of the ones seen from the bridge is to the starboard of the ship in the next external shot, and there's another to the stern as it begins its dive toward the Death Star. That's ten accounted for in twenty seconds from a limited field of view.
1.15.5.1.2. Con: Outside of the now non-canon Legends EU material, no Mon Cal cruiser was greater than a mile in length, certainly not in the time frame of them being "The Rebel Alliance".
1.15.5.1.3. Con: Bigger does not mean better. Size matters very little if you can't hit your opponent, they are faster than you, outmanoeuvre you, out range you and potentially pack more advanced and powerful firepower on a smaller frame. Besides, remember, the Death Star was destroyed by a single snub fighter.
1.15.5.1.4. Con: -> See 1.15.5.1.1.1.1.1.
1.15.6. Pro: Starfleet has the industrial capacity of many member worlds. During the Borg and Dominion threat Starfleet was able to bolster fleets very rapidly.
1.15.7. Con: Since this does appear to be the case, it would then open the door to many rebel-led raids on shipyards, supply depots, and the various resources the Federation has ample of. This is, after all, exactly what "rebels" do. It's almost necessary in fact. There would not be much point in rebelling against an inferior foe - they would rebel against you.
1.15.7.1. Con: Starfleet vessels are fitted with a self-destruct mechanism - it follows that their manufacturing facilities would be too. The high-ranking officers of any Starfleet facility would activate the self-destruct before evacuating even if the Rebel Alliance could defeat Starfleet security. Ion cannons would only disable the facility, so the Rebels would be left with a massive collection of dead technology they know very little about.
1.15.7.2. Con: While it is true that this is what rebels do, it is also true that the vast majority of the time, rebels fail in these endeavors. [Source: Why Revolutions Succeed and Fail](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3234558?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
1.15.8. Pro: The Federation industry is largely in the form of Replicators, making it very flexible on what it can produce on short order. As a replicator with raw material and power can make whatever, there's a lot less big supply depots sitting around for rebels to try and raid- they can't pick up and take a built-in replicator and they can't steal material that hasn't been replicated yet.
1.16. Pro: The Rebel Alliance has decades of experience fighting an asymmetric war.
1.16.1. Con: The Federation has experience fighting a small rebellious force.
1.16.1.1. Con: The United Federation performs better against stronger enemies, such as the Q Continuum or the Borg. They regularly deal with godlike figures who can create matter from sheer will and defeat them.
1.16.1.2. Pro: The Federation is adept at quickly overcoming asymmetric capabilities in combat. This is the basis for many points of conflict in the series, esp. the Borg.
1.16.1.3. Con: Just like the Rebel Alliance has experience fighting a much larger authoritative force. In fact, fighting a larger and better equipped force is the main purpose of their existence.
1.16.1.3.1. Con: Better equipped may be a stretched. Numerically superior would be more accurate.
1.16.1.3.1.1. Pro: While no Rebel cap ship is a match 1:1 for an ISD \(Imperial Class Star Destroyer\) or ISDII, the Star Destroyer has flaws in terms of it's anti-fighter abilities.
1.16.1.3.1.2. Pro: Y-wings and B-wings are shown to be substantially better than their Imperial counterpart, the TIE Bomber. X-Wings are equal or superior to TIE fighters, and A-Wings are also comparatively better than TIE Interceptors. Thus every Rebel fighter is demonstrably superior to their Imperial counterparts, which hardly makes them an inferior force.
1.16.1.4. Pro: The federation has fought against and prevented incursions from the mirror universe and some infiltration from species 8472
1.16.1.5. Pro: While fighting the Maquis, the Federation teamed up and enforced treaties with other galactic powers to keep them in check.
1.16.1.5.1. Con: The Federation would not have this option during a single space battle.
1.16.1.5.2. Con: The Federation couldn't deal with the Maquis effectively at all. The Dominion had to step in to deal with it.
1.16.1.5.2.1. Con: It is debatable just how much effort Starfleet put into defeating the Marquis, given their location, outside of Federation jurisdiction, as well as sympathy's among the Federation and Starfleet officers for the Marquis.
1.16.1.5.3. Con: The Rebellion does not generally engage in standard warfare and cannot be compared to the Maquis. The Rebellion isn't simply a bunch of rebels fighting against the Cardassian border but a highly organised hierarchical structure with plenty of armament much greater than the Maquis who were poorly equipped having little if any capital ships unlike the Rebellion.
1.16.2. Con: The Federation has former Maquis resistance fighters, familiar with these tactics and varieties of warfare.
1.16.3. Con: The Rebels could not rely on the strategies that led them to their one and only big victory against the Empire.
1.16.3.1. Pro: One of the biggest reasons the Rebels had a chance to take down the Empire was its flawed strategy of putting too much resources in one single war machine, the Death Star, and one single leader, the Emperor. The Rebellion cannot hope to use singular bold actions to cripple the Federation.
1.16.3.1.1. Pro: Due to its diversity and praise of intellect regardless of source, the Federation has a more rigid and stable structure, which is much more difficult to dismantle.
1.16.3.2. Pro: The Rebel Alliance won when they assassinated the emperor and his second in command. The Federation is not set up like a dictatorship, so killing one or two high-ranking people would not be as detrimental.
1.16.4. Con: The Rebels would not have a moral imperative against the Federations thus their insurgent style and local collaborators would not provide the needed intelligence that it relied on to defeat the empire. On the same note the Federation's counter intelligence and technological \(simple cameras\) observation capabilities would undermine the Rebel's actions and lead to their failure.
1.16.4.1. Con: The Federation has the moral imperative. So did the rebellion, the difference being is that most people joined the rebellion to overthrow a wicked regime and have more drive but most people joined the federation because it is the next step after education and they are not warriors by nature but explorers.
1.16.4.1.1. Con: Federation service is not the next step after education. This was explicitly established by Picard's brother Robert in the episode "Family." While the show focuses on Starfleet, we know there are a variety of career paths available to citizens--we've mainly come across traders and teachers. Starfleet is the equivalent career as modern day military, with the training and psychological conditioning to match.
1.16.4.2. Con: The conflict between the Empire and the Rebels would not necessarily be that different from a conflict with Starfleet in that the Empire and Starfleet are both highly organized attempts at universal homogeneity in governance based on their own moral imperative. Given the nature of the Rebel Alliance is to rebel against homogeneity of moral imperative contrary to their own, there is no reason to believe they would be less resistant to Federation opposition. One "order" is as bad as the other.
1.16.4.2.1. Con: The idea of the Rebellion was to fight against the tyranny of the Empire - the Federation as per the 'Prime Directive' cannot and will not enforce their ideology on another. This would mean that the Rebels will still have little to no obligation to even contact to the Federation aside from curiosity - let alone fire on them.
1.16.4.2.2. Con: This reduces the Rebel's motivation to the point of absurdity. They weren't fighting for anarchy, they were fighting for the freedom embodied by the Federation. There is no reason to believe they would be anything but receptive of the Federation's ideals.
1.16.4.3. Con: However it is notable to point out that the Federation does have some elements of unrest in their society. See The Maquis, an insurgent force that only the ruthlessness of the Dominion was able to put down, not the Federation.
1.16.4.3.1. Con: The Maquis generally did not attack the Federation, and action was complicated by foreign policy and law regarding the treatment of Federation citizens. These considerations would not be in play against the Rebel Alliance.
1.16.4.4. Pro: Some people may harbour only a hatred against the Empire and see simply only futility in a fight against the Federation as they have no antagonistic attitudes towards them - this may cause people to desert, turncoat or even just lay down arms
1.16.4.5. Pro: The Federation excels at dissuading civil unrest. The Rebellion would have a hard time forming much less finding financial support in waging a war against the Federation. The Star Trek equivalents to the Rebellion \(most notably the Maquis\) tend to be sporadic, isolated and never pose much of a threat.
1.16.5. Con: The Federation has experience fighting the Borg, which is a far more asymmetric war. If we count DS9, the same applies to the Dominion.
1.16.5.1. Pro: There was extreme asymmetry in terms of technology. Borg ships shrug off weapons fire after a couple hits, with the first few allowing them to become stronger. They had better weapons, better propulsion, better shields--they greatly outclassed the Federation. Starfleet used the uneven battle to improve themselves.
1.16.5.2. Pro: The asymmetric warfare between Starfleet and the Borg looks similar to the Rebels' asymmetric fight against the Empire. In both cases, we have one side that fights by overwhelming numbers, causing enemy attrition, and mass destruction \(assimilation\), with the other [reverse-engineer technology](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Astrometrics), using [infiltration](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Erin_Hansen) and [similar tactics](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Transwarp_coil), and [terrorism](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Hugh).
1.16.6. Con: The Federation has been at war with several major civilizations and conglomerations for most of its history, including Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians, The Dominion and the Borg. The conflicts have been fought on all levels, from ship engagement in space to military engagement on a planetary scale. The Federation is therefore quite accustomed to war in all of its forms, symmetric as well as asymmetric.
1.16.7. Pro: The Rebellion has developed sound war doctrine to defeat a better manned, better trained, and technologically superior foe \(the Empire\). The Federation would be stunned by the unorthodox intelligence missions and hit-and-run missions that the rebellion used to conquer the Galactic Empire's throneworld and throttle their wartime resources and industry.
1.16.7.1. Con: While it is certain that the Empire were more numerical, the onscreen evidence does not support the claim that they were better trained or technologically superior. Even better equipped is a stretch, given that the Empires best body armour can be defeated by teddy bears with sticks and stones.
1.16.7.1.1. Pro: The almost complete ineffectiveness of the armor to spears implies it may only be effective against certain types of energy weapons. This would suggest it would be vulnerable to Starfleet weapons like the [TR-116 rifle](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/TR-116_rifle).
1.16.7.1.2. Pro: Better trained is relative. The rebels were fighting a foe that wasn't trained to go up against guerilla tactics; Starfleet officers are trained to account for any number of tactics, both traditional and guerilla. Picard's capture on Cardassia demonstrates this training. Essentially, their effectiveness was against a specific kind of "better training" that does not apply against Starfleet.
1.16.7.1.3. Pro: While the Empire had more equipment, they were using the same or similar gear; their equips were taken from the Empire. Whereas Starfleet will have a completely different caliber of equipment.
1.16.7.1.4. Con: The performance of the Ewoks is way overblown.  After the initial surprise attack, the Imperial troops had them on the run until Chewbacca managed to steal an AT-ST.
1.16.7.1.4.1. Con: The Imperial Troops \(Stormtroopers\) were getting their behinds kicked.

The AT-ST's were doing a good job, but the Ewoks even took care of two of those on their own... with logs and trees.
1.16.7.1.4.1.1. Con: The Ewoks had terrain advantages and knowledge of the area, not to mention a huge numbers advantage. The stormtroopers losses were not a result of failure of technology, so I don't think their loss is relevant to the discussion of technology.
1.16.7.1.4.1.1.1. Con: If it can be defeated by primitive bows and arrows, bolas and small rocks, and sticks/clubs/maces and spears wielded by small creatures, it must not be terribly effective or advanced.
1.16.7.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Stormtrooper armor was not defeated by bows and arrows.  The one shot we see actually injure a trooper hit the neck joint and penetrated the body glove, [not an armor plate](https://i.imgur.com/STHmfuk.jpg).  In the same scene, at nearly the same time, another arrow is depicted striking the back plate of a scout trooper's armor and bouncing off with considerable force, shown on the left in this series of screenshots: [1](https://imgur.com/eqRhyaV), [2](https://imgur.com/JplaCgV), [3](https://imgur.com/6rXykeL).
1.16.7.1.4.1.1.2. Pro: As the question specifically states a space battle, and the Ewoks are not on the Federations side, and it's the Rebels and not the Imperials, the discussion of stormtroopers and their armour capabilities has no bearing on the discussion or result.
1.16.7.2. Con: The Federation is highly adaptable and used to infiltrators, be they the Romulan Tal'Shiar, The Cardassian Obsidian Order, the Rebel Marquis or the Shapeshifting Founder Changelings of the Dominion. It's own covert operation sections, both Starfleet Intelligence, and the less official \(and far less ethical\) section 31, proved to be highly adept at countering them or even out doing them. One even hid its existence from most for over a century and a half.
1.16.8. Con: They have two decades of experience at most, and it actually seems they formed as an actual active resistance force 14-15 years after the formation of the Empire, giving them only five to six years experience.
1.16.8.1. Con: The military leadership of the Rebellion is made up of seasoned military leaders that fought in a variety of conflicts, including the Clone Wars.
1.16.8.2. Pro: Even if it's accepted that they had 2 decades, it means it took them 16 years to get their first, significant win. This was followed by a second victory, then 3 years of running and hiding, a crushing defeat, more hiding, and then a final Victory. The argument that they are experienced is not really borne out by that evidence.
1.16.8.2.1. Con: Experience comes through defeat as well as through victory. The Empire's victories were only Pyrrhic victories, as they were unable to prevent their defeat. Years of successfully surviving provided the Rebellion with the experience needed to win the final battles.
