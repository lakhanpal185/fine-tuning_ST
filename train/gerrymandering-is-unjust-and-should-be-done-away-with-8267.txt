Discussion Title: Gerrymandering is unjust and should be done away with.

1. Gerrymandering is unjust and should be done away with.
1.1. Pro: Votes donâ€™t matter in gerrymandered districts.
1.1.1. Pro: In 2012, Republican congressional candidates in Ohio received just more than half of the statewide vote and won [75% of the seats](https://www.fairdistrictsohio.org/blog/four-reasons-gerrymandering-is-killing-democracy).
1.2. Con: The difference between gerrymandering and redistricting is that the former is done with partisan intentions. Redistricting is necessary in a democracy and partisan intentions are inevitable, thus gerrymandering cannot be done away with.
1.3. Con: Gerrymandering allows officials to more effectively represent the interests of their constituency.
1.3.1. Pro: If a district is drawn to favor one party, then a majority of people in that district will be happy with their representative. In districts that are close, depending on the voting method at least a big section to upwards of over 50% of the people in that district would be unhappy with their representative.
1.3.2. Con: Democracy is not about efficiency, otherwise many of the hallmarks of democracy - such as minority rights - would most likely be done away with.
1.4. Pro: Gerrymandering benefits the party in power, decreasing the likelihood of getting voted out and losing that power.
1.5. Pro: Gerrymandering [brings out partisan extremes](https://www.fairdistrictsohio.org/blog/four-reasons-gerrymandering-is-killing-democracy), increasing polarization.
1.6. Pro: Gerrymandering tears apart communities. Some cities exist within three or more different congressional districts to carve up cities, diluting their voting strength.
1.7. Con: Eliminating all gerrymandering makes it much less likely that enough [members of a racial or ethnic minority](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/could-gerrymandering-be-good-for-democracy-119581?o=1) could elect a representative from their group.
