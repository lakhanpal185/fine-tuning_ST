Discussion Title: Should India have a UBI?

1. India should have a Universal Basic Income \(UBI\).
1.1. Pro: A UBI would improve democracy in India.
1.1.1. Pro: UBI could induce in due course a significant decline in clientelism, and voters could increasingly evaluate politicians on governance performance rather than
patronage promises. [ihdindia.org](http://www.ihdindia.org/Booklet.pdf)
1.2. Con: Introducing a UBI would lead to a roll-back of other government subsidies.
1.2.1. Pro: The Indian government with the current fiscal deficit can't afford both the existing farming subsidies and UBI, meaning subsidies would be removed. This could put food production levels in danger, thereby causing a[food crisis](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/jUFCF5HIrdVr1iqOsbXn6O/Will-a-universal-basic-income-work-in-India.html).
1.2.1.1. Pro: Rolling back subsidies to introduce UBI will require extraordinary degree of cooperation between states and the central government.Which seems quite difficult in case of Indian government.[livemint.com](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/jUFCF5HIrdVr1iqOsbXn6O/Will-a-universal-basic-income-work-in-India.html)
1.2.2. Pro: A UBI would disincentivise other programs to help the poor that are not money-based, such as  food distribution.
1.3. Pro: A UBI would create a more harmonious society.
1.3.1. Pro: UBI keeps every group happy by laying down a cushion for those who fail, resulting in better sustained peace and harmony.
1.3.1.1. Pro: UBI defuses populism by making capitalism kinder to the masses, softening its edges for groups that can't sustain the pressure. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/business/dealbook/universal-basic-income.html?mtrref=undefined&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com)
1.3.1.2. Pro: UBI relieves the tensions not just for the poor but also for the rich who see in widening inequality the potential of mobs wielding pitchforks. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/business/dealbook/universal-basic-income.html?mtrref=undefined&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com)
1.3.2. Pro: Implementation of a UBI will reduce crime.
1.3.2.1. Pro: In a pilot project in Namibia where every resident of a village was provided the basic income, the crime rate was [dropped by 36.5%](https://futurism.com/images/universal-basic-income-answer-automation/).
1.3.2.2. Pro: UBI will reduce the incentive to commit a crime for basic requirements like food and shelter.
1.3.3. Pro: A UBI will enhance autonomy, freedom and dignity of individuals.
1.4. Pro: UBI is an appropriate reparations payment for past injustices of misattributed property rights.
1.4.1. Pro: [Thomas Paine](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/rethinking-the-idea-of-a-basic-income-for-all/?mtrref=undefined&mtrref=economix.blogs.nytimes.com&mtrref=economix.blogs.nytimes.com) proposed that young people are owed a UBI as compensation for the loss of their natural inheritance in land, seized by the state to sell to particular individuals.
1.5. Con: A UBI would have negative psychological impacts on India's population.
1.5.1. Pro: Being able to work means more than just paying the bills; it is also about purpose of life and social status.
1.6. Con: The Indian government cannot afford to introduce a UBI.
1.6.1. Pro: Approximately 220 million people in India live in poverty. If we give $25 a month to each one, it requires 66 billion dollars a year. The government simply can't afford it. UBI is infeasible. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/business/economy/universal-basic-income-poverty.html?mtrref=undefined&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com)
1.6.1.1. Pro: And that’s just accounting for the poor. The U in UBI is for Universal, so giving everyone an equal handout would be beyond India’s capability at this point.
1.6.1.2. Con: The GDP of India is about [$2.8 trillion \(2018\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India) so the $66 billion is affordable \(about 2.3 percent of GDP\) and could be recovered from increased taxes on those with over median income.
1.6.2. Con: India can afford a [space programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Space_Research_Organisation), a [nuclear programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction), a huge standing [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Army) and an [F1 team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_India). It can afford a UBI programme. It's not a matter of cost, but of priorities.
1.6.3. Pro: If India were to undergo a period of economic stagnation, those people dependent on it would go right below the poverty line.
1.6.3.1. Con: If India goes under economic stagnation at least people will have something\(UBI\) to fall back on.
1.6.4. Pro: A UBI will provide these people guarantee of a lifetime of dependence on the state.
1.6.4.1. Con: The money could be invested to secure an independent source of income for the future
1.7. Con: A UBI would be bad for the economy.
1.7.1. Pro: Aside from obvious inflationary impact and a sky high debt, it would dramatically reduce the incentive among poorer and unemployed sections to engage in meaningful economic transactions that would actually propel them to an economically prosperous life.
1.7.2. Pro: A UBI would negatively affect unemployment.
1.7.2.1. Con: U.S. researchers at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy studied the impact of Alaska Permanent fund and found that employment didn't decrease but number of people in part time work actually increased.  [futurism.com](https://futurism.com/basic-income-part-time-work/)
1.7.2.1.1. Pro: Due to automation, all jobs by human is in danger. Experts are constantly researching about UBI as a feasible option. This research can help experts making their views on UBI.[futurism.com](https://futurism.com/basic-income-part-time-work/)
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: In the USA, a scheme called the Alaska Permanent Fund, almost similar to UBI, was implemented in Alaska. It didn't discourage work. There is hope for UBI. [bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-23/a-basic-income-for-everyone-it-s-not-a-crazy-idea)
1.7.2.2. Con: UBI could be a fix for when robots take over a big chunk of our jobs and cause mass [unemployment](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-23/a-basic-income-for-everyone-it-s-not-a-crazy-idea).
1.7.2.2.1. Con: Robots taking over our jobs is a problem of the distant future, not of the present. Silicon valley's concerns over mass unemployment are too hyped up to be taken seriously. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/business/economy/universal-basic-income-poverty.html?mtrref=undefined&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com)
1.7.2.3. Con: Introducing a UBI will increase the spending habits of people and this will increase the demand for workers and ultimately more employment.
1.7.2.4. Pro: A UBI will sap people's desire to hustle & disincentivize work, leading to general population inertia.
1.7.2.4.1. Pro: By giving people basic income security, UBI will make people lax with their responsibilities.
1.7.3. Pro: UBI itself is a misnomer as all economies stride on the principle of 'no work no pay'. India will actively loose out in its tax remittance leading to all round poorer finances for developmental activities besides slowing down growth rates. UBI therefore would not augur well for India.
1.8. Con: A UBI is a big intervention in the economy. The state should not change property rights at such a level.
1.8.1. Pro: Such a level of interventionism would put the market into disequilibrium
1.8.1.1. Con: Market [equillibrium](http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Competitive_markets/Market_equilibrium.html) as a point where supply meets demand is naturally dynamic over time, there is nothing about UBI that could influence it beyond its predictable behaviour.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: UBI does not artificially create or move demand on goods, it doesn't set price caps or floors, and is not setting any constraints on supply, therefore it is not similar to other forms of government intervention.
1.8.1.1.2. Pro: In economic theory UBI may be perceived as an increase in dispensable income of households on the cost of other government spendings.
1.8.2. Con: It is more like a change in income rights rather than property rights.
1.8.3. Con: Any intervention in the economy is welcome, if the intention behind this intervention is to benefit citizens, like a UBI.
1.8.3.1. Pro: The state must intervene to protect its poorest citizens, which is what the UBI would achieve.
1.9. Con: A UBI has never been implemented before. The implementation is dangerous because you don't know the impact on economy. It may be harmful.
1.9.1. Con: Just because something has not been tried yet, doesn't mean you should not try it. You can try out the UBI in a small part of India, for example a pilot project with evaluation in a small village.
1.9.2. Con: A small UBI has already been implemented in Alaska \(the Permanent Fund of Alaska\), with good results on reducing  poverty.
1.10. Con: The [caste system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India) in India would stand in the way of a truly universal basic income.
1.10.1. Con: Discrimination against lower castes is illegal in India under Article 15 of its [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India).
1.11. Pro: A UBI would bring greater social justice and equality.
1.11.1. Con: Govt aid and assistance should be need based. UBI ignores need and will also go to ppl who don't need it as desperately as some others. That will be unfair to the latter group. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/business/economy/universal-basic-income-poverty.html?mtrref=undefined&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com)
1.11.2. Pro: It’s a human right to have enough money to live on, which a UBI would provide.
1.11.3. Con: A UBI would not really redistribute wealth, as it is applied regardless of need, meaning everybody would get it and there would be no objective difference.
1.11.4. Pro: A UBI solves income inequality.
1.11.4.1. Pro: In India, a UBI would improve gender equality, as poorer incomes are typically earned by women.
1.11.4.1.1. Pro: Women are more likely to be paid less than men for the same work they did. [amp.scroll.in](https://amp.scroll.in/article/872151/is-universal-basic-income-the-solution-to-womens-inequality)
1.11.4.1.2. Pro: Women are more likely to take time out of their work to care for others.[amp.scroll.in](https://amp.scroll.in/article/872151/is-universal-basic-income-the-solution-to-womens-inequality)
1.11.4.1.3. Pro: Women face more difficulties than a men to get out of poverty. The ratio is disproportionate between man and women among the poor.[amp.scroll.in](https://amp.scroll.in/article/872151/is-universal-basic-income-the-solution-to-womens-inequality)
1.11.4.1.3.1. Pro: Financial weakness can lead to financial dependence which can have several disadvantages like domestic violence.[amp.scroll.in](https://amp.scroll.in/article/872151/is-universal-basic-income-the-solution-to-womens-inequality)
1.11.4.1.4. Pro: UBI might help low paid jobs which are dominated by women, such as healthcare or education. [amp.scroll.in](https://amp.scroll.in/article/872151/is-universal-basic-income-the-solution-to-womens-inequality)
1.11.4.1.5. Pro: A carer in the house which is usually a women in India would get their income from taxes given by the person who is working.[amp.scroll.in](https://amp.scroll.in/article/872151/is-universal-basic-income-the-solution-to-womens-inequality)
1.11.4.1.6. Con: UBI will provide a basic income to everyone regardless of your income, employment status etc. This will lead to higher inequality and poverty as it will replace the current unemployment schemes with a basic income to everyone. We will end up giving same basic income to the billionaires and the poor. The deserving groups receive less than what they should have received.[tinyurl.com](https://tinyurl.com/yb5vnqf8)
1.11.4.2. Con: -> See 1.11.3.
1.11.4.3. Pro: Due to UBI riches will be taxed fairly and it will try to reduce income disparities.[independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/our-voices/battle-of-ideas/universal-basic-income-ubi-human-rights-money-poverty-help-living-costs-a8190326.html)
1.11.4.3.1. Pro: People argue about riches getting UBI. At the end those are the people who will liable to higher taxes.[independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/our-voices/battle-of-ideas/universal-basic-income-ubi-human-rights-money-poverty-help-living-costs-a8190326.html)
1.11.4.4. Pro: After the Industrial Revolution, [most of the income](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/our-voices/battle-of-ideas/universal-basic-income-ubi-human-rights-money-poverty-help-living-costs-a8190326.html) has gone to the people who have their own land and capital. UBI will help to bridge the gap.
1.11.5. Pro: A UBI would enable the poorest members of the population to cover their basic needs.
1.11.5.1. Pro: Malnutrition in India is a big concern.Study shows that implementing UBI during pilot projects decrease the proportion of malnourished children from 42% to 10% in Namibia[futurism.com](https://futurism.com/images/universal-basic-income-answer-automation/)
1.11.6. Pro: UBI gives people a basic security and thereby empowers them to raise their voice against exploitation in their job situations. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/business/dealbook/universal-basic-income.html?mtrref=undefined&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com)
1.11.7. Con: For countries with comprehensive and progressive transfer systems, the IMF says that replacing existing transfer systems with UBI could mean large losses for some groups, resulting in higher poverty.[forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2017/10/15/the-imf-gives-a-cautious-welcome-to-universal-basic-income/2/#632de71898f2)
1.12. Pro: A UBI would be more effective than existing welfare programs for the poor.
1.12.1. Pro: Bureaucrats and panchayats would no longer be administering private transfer programs, leading to a shift in focus towards public good programs.
1.12.2. Con: By reallocating welfare payments from targeted areas to a generalised transfer to everyone, the amount that goes to the
most deserving is lower.
1.12.3. Pro: A UBI eases problems associated with determining who the welfare programs should serve.
1.12.3.1. Pro: The Indian government tends to "[mess up](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/jUFCF5HIrdVr1iqOsbXn6O/Will-a-universal-basic-income-work-in-India.html)" when it comes to distinguishing poor and non-poor, so the benefits don't reach the poor. As the implementation of UBI won't require classification, more people will be benefitted.
1.12.3.1.1. Con: In recent times when the govt. tried to replace subsidies with direct transfer,it results in public dissatisfaction.So the implementation should not be universal.
1.12.3.2. Pro: Everyone is eligible for UBI. It eliminates the nonstop fighting about who deserves what & frees us of the stigma typically attached to programs for the poor.[nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/business/economy/universal-basic-income-poverty.html?mtrref=undefined&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com)
1.12.4. Con: UBI is predicated upon the idea that a baseline welfare should serve as an incentive for people to work harder and be productive. However, there are rampant issues which prevent that from happening as well as preventing optimal fund utilization such as poverty, low literacy-educational and financial or segregation in the rural and urban areas.
1.12.4.1. Pro: There are already subsidies, waivers and schemes for available for people under financial stress which don't reach the intended targets due to an ineffectual PDS.
1.12.5. Pro: Giving money is better than other forms of help, as the poor ppl are better placed than bureaucrats to determine the most beneficial use of aid of money. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/business/dealbook/universal-basic-income.html?mtrref=undefined&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com)
1.12.6. Pro: UBI can be distributed directly into bank accounts and is easier to administer than other programs for the poor. It is therefore more effective. [carnegieindia.org](http://carnegieindia.org/2018/02/14/india-s-universal-basic-income-bedeviled-by-details-pub-75500)
1.12.6.1. Pro: In India antipoverty programs and subsidies have failed the poor due to corruption. UBI is a universal right that is harder to tamper with. [carnegieindia.org](http://carnegieindia.org/2018/02/14/india-s-universal-basic-income-bedeviled-by-details-pub-75500)
1.12.7. Pro: Govt welfare programs are generally underfunded as it rarely carries political consequences as the poor rarely vote. UBI will eliminate that exploitation.[nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/business/economy/universal-basic-income-poverty.html?mtrref=undefined&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com&mtrref=www.nytimes.com)
1.12.7.1. Con: We don't know how it will suit us as UBI's execution will cause a massive disruption and unpredictable changes in the Indian labor market. [hindustantimes.com](https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-needs-a-universal-basic-income-scheme-but-the-conditions-are-not-ripe-yet/story-ONKL0SLTUjQVajq2ncXZpK.html)
1.13. Pro: A UBI would give humans more time to spend on more worthwhile activities.
1.13.1. Con: There is no reason to think that other activities, such as spending time with family, are more worthwhile than the contributions made by the work people do in their jobs, especially in non-individualistic, societal terms.
1.13.2. Pro: In India, where [22% of the population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_India) lives under the poverty line, a UBI will give them the freedom to explore new ideas. It will enable them to take risks and try new ideas that could change the world.
1.13.3. Pro: UBI will provide people time to spent with their family instead of just earning money to survive.
