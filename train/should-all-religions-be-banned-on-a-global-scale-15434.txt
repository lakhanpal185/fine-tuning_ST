Discussion Title: Should all religions be banned on a global scale?

1. All religions should be banned on a global scale.
1.1. Pro: Any benefit that an organized religion could provide a society is lost in its power struggles, dogma and hypocrisy.
1.1.1. Con: Uselessness doesn't warrant a ban.
1.1.2. Con: There are power struggles \(different schools of thought and theories\) in almost every field of Science yet it doesn't devalue Science or void the manifest results.
1.1.3. Con: People still find hope and strength through religion regardless of these struggles and dogma.
1.1.4. Pro: Religion is one of the only things that actively invades and wants to control many aspects of one's private life which is something that law cannot do.
1.1.4.1. Pro: Religion tries to control and restrict human bodily autonomy.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Control does not imply harm.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Forcing women to continue their pregnancy and give birth may be harmful for the woman. Also, having to raise an unplanned child in a difficult economical or social environment can be a source of pain, such as starvation.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: This is to prevent the greater harm of a death of a child. Religious view abortion as killing a human being with a soul and abhorrent in the same way most people would feel about killing an infant.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The murder of children is wrong
1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: While it is true that religious people view abortion as killing a human being it is not true that a fetus is equivalent to a child.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1.3. Con: The Catholic Church cares much more about the new adept-to-be rather than the wellness of women.
1.1.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See discussion #5637: Women should have the right to choose abortion.
1.1.4.1.1.1.3. Pro: Fetuses do not have a conscious mind capable of experiencing pain and suffering. Pain reception only develops well into the [third trimester](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-does-consciousness-arise/) of pregnancy.
1.1.4.1.1.1.4. Pro: As the fetus is a biological extension of the mother, it is up to her do with it what she sees fit.
1.1.4.1.1.1.5. Con: Not all religious people view abortion as wrong.
1.1.4.1.1.1.5.1. Con: In a lot of cases, even if individual believers do not think abortion is wrong, their religious teachings say otherwise.
1.1.4.1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: The [Roman Catholic Church](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/abortion_1.shtml#h2) considers an abortion "a grave moral wrong"; in [Sikhism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml) abortion if forbiden; [Hinduism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml) is opposed to it, except where it is necessary to save the mother; [Islam](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml) regards abortion as wrong and forbidden though with vital exceptions and [Judaism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/abortion_1.shtml) only permits it for serious reasons.
1.1.4.1.1.1.5.2. Pro: Some [Catholics](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/abortion_1.shtml#h2) disagree with the Vatican about abortion and the Church has expressed the right and responsibility of each believer "to follow his or her own conscience on moral matters, even when it conflicts with Church teaching".
1.1.4.1.1.1.6. Con: Many religious people feel that while abortion is wrong, it goes against the tenets of that religion to force that belief on others.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: "Forced conversions" implies harm would befall the converted if they would not convert. Therefore, this conversion is harmful to the well-being of the converted.
1.1.4.1.1.3. Pro: Control is not necessarily harming people. [Leadership and followship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_leadership_theory) can be beneficial to both parties. Power is sometimes viewed as only tyrannical control over the populations, but we often forget the benevolent and caring side of organized social structures.
1.1.4.1.1.3.1. Pro: Traditionally, a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy) is a way for the followers to elect the leaders. People choose and respect the most competent people that they can trust to rule over them and represent their views on large scale issues.
1.1.4.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Democracy is a very inefficient type of government structure. It is maintained as a social luxury, not for its merit.
1.1.4.1.1.3.2. Con: Even if control was beneficial for a person, it would still be unjustified. Each person should have the right to decide how they will live their life, and noone should be able to make that decision for them. To decide otherwise is the beginning of tyranny.
1.1.4.1.1.3.2.1. Con: People can value security over freedom and therefore feel happier when they don't have to choose everything themselves. Excessive choice is tyranny to some.
1.1.4.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.3.2.
1.1.4.1.1.5. Pro: Religious social control can be and most often is consensually chosen by the believers themselves, particularly among converts.
1.1.4.1.1.5.1. Con: If the religion has control over public policy and uses it to exert social control, then non-believers will also be forced to adhere nonconsensually to the control created. [Pew Article on views on abortion](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/22/american-religious-groups-vary-widely-in-their-views-of-abortion/)[Views on homosexuality](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/views-about-homosexuality/)
1.1.4.1.1.5.2. Con: Religious control uses emotion and faith which ignore reason. This makes the religion itself and the individuals less able to rationally evaluate social impacts or structures. A tipping point emerges when a religion cannot assess appropriate impacts within a larger group and are outcast as cult.
1.1.4.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: The problem is more profound when the religion wields too much influence for it to be outcast.
1.1.4.1.1.5.3. Con: Being born and indoctrinated into a faith is not voluntary. Moreover several religions place severe consequences on those who leave.
1.1.4.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: Hasidic Jews are [indoctrinated](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/21/ex-hasidim-life-stories_n_7343084.html) from a young age, often poorly educated \(with lack of English skills\) and pressured to have and provide for big families at really young ages. Those who try to live [secularly](http://www.nycreligion.info/leaving-ultraorthodox-judaism/) are often completely [rejected](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/magazine/the-high-price-of-leaving-ultra-orthodox-life.html) and, in many cases, their religious communities fight to keep custody of their [children](https://www.refinery29.com/2017/10/177040/netflix-one-of-us-orthodox-jewish-women-abuse-etty?bucketed=true).
1.1.4.1.1.5.3.2. Pro: If you leave Islam in certain countries you will die. If you leave Jehova's witnesses you will never speak to your family again. Same with the Amish. But more importantly you did not choose to have the religion forced on you as a child and it may be so deep in your brain that you could never escape.
1.1.4.1.1.5.3.3. Pro: Religious indoctrination at young ages can have harmful [consequences](https://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/the_sad_twisted_truth_about_conservative_christianitys_effect_on_the_mind_partner/).
1.1.4.1.1.5.3.3.1. Pro: Among some religious creeds, [child abuse and neglect](https://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/the_sad_twisted_truth_about_conservative_christianitys_effect_on_the_mind_partner/) is more common when certain variables are found: authoritarianism, isolation and fear.
1.1.4.1.1.5.3.4. Pro: [Religious Trauma Syndrome \(RTS\)](http://www.babcp.com/Review/RTS-Trauma-from-Leaving-Religion.aspx) “is a function of both the chronic abuses of harmful religion and the impact of severing one’s connection with one’s faith” and can be compared to a combination of PTSD and Complex PTSD.
1.1.4.1.1.5.3.5. Pro: Religions are routinely introduced to children who are too young to make an informed choice.
1.1.4.1.1.5.3.5.1. Con: Children are capable of choice, but the degree to which they can make an informed and/or rational decision will vary from not at all, through not enough, to a minority who are as capable of making a decision as an adult.
1.1.4.1.1.5.3.5.2. Pro: [Circumcision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision#Cultures_and_religions) is performed by Jews on the eighth day of life.
1.1.4.1.1.5.3.5.3. Pro: The [First Communion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Communion) is normally received around the ages of 7 to 10  after a period or [cathequesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechesis) \(education\). And [Confirmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation#cite_note-28), the time when the believer really gives consent, also happens when children are young or in their mid-teens.
1.1.4.1.1.5.3.5.4. Pro: Catholic parents [baptise](http://www.annunciationevv.org/Guidelines-for-Baptism) their children when they are babies and thus introduce them into the Catholic faith when they cannot consent.
1.1.4.1.1.6. Pro: The creation of standardized structures of morality keeps society predictable and manageable by those who live within them.
1.1.4.1.1.6.1. Con: Religion is not required to create these standardised structures. Morality can successfully be defined by secular methods as well.
1.1.4.1.1.6.2. Con: Creating one standardized structure of morality is near impossible even within one religion, much less in a way that creates predictability about how you should live. Evidence for this is differing opinions on any number of moral issues between different sects of Christianity, Islam or Judaism. If you live in society where multiple sects or multiple religions coexist whose standard prevails?
1.1.4.1.1.7. Con: Control implies a reduction in freedom. Individual freedom should not be impinged upon except to protect others.
1.1.4.1.1.7.1. Con: Limiting individual freedom is necessary for group activities. The limitations of freedom a parent places on a child are for that child's own good, and similarly it does not follow that the controls exerted by religious adherence are necessarily bad for the individual.
1.1.4.1.1.7.1.1. Con: A gilded cage is still a cage.
1.1.4.1.1.8. Pro: Social control is not a minus in environments lacking other forms of control.
1.1.4.1.1.9. Pro: The state is a form of social control too. Control is necessary to safeguard the rules that keep society safe and working and to protect the values we hold important. Without control, society would not exist.
1.1.4.1.2. Pro: Religion exercises control banning or prohibiting abortion and contraception.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.1.2.
1.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: This regulation made overpopulation worse. [Overpopulation](http://churchandstate.org.uk/2015/12/how-religion-is-making-overpopulation-worse/) is the main cause of many major problems around the world.
1.1.4.1.2.2.1. Con: The preservation of life has a [marginal effect](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/causes-effects-solutions-of-overpopulation.php) on population growth. Other factors to take into consideration are: the decrease in mortality rates, the overcoming of poverty, advancements in fertility treatments, immigration and the lack of family planning.
1.1.4.1.2.2.1.1. Con: Religiosity has [decreased](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/do-countries-lose-religion-as-they-gain-wealth-1.1310451) internationally, especially in developed countries, and many believers do not follow every religious teaching, yet if most of the world’s population did, overpopulation could be a bigger problem.
1.1.4.1.2.2.1.2. Con: The [Roman Catholic Church](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/contraception_1.shtml) refuses artificial methods of contraception; many [Hindus](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/contraception.shtml) are unlikely to use contraception; in [Orthodox Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_contraception), birth control is not acceptable or only to use in limited circumstances and although [Islam](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/contraception.shtml) allows contraception, more conservative leaders campaign against it.
1.1.4.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Opposing birth control and contraception can be viewed as advocating against promiscuity.
1.1.4.1.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Regardless of how one views it the consequences are real and can be shown.
1.1.4.1.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: When contraception is prohibited even between married spouses, promiscuity is not the key element in its prohibition.
1.1.4.1.2.2.2. Con: -> See discussion #9226: Global overpopulation is a myth.
1.1.4.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.2.1.2.1.
1.1.4.1.2.4. Con: Opposing abortion is a testament to the preservation of life. Abortion can be viewed as killing potential life.
1.1.4.1.2.4.1. Con: The preservation of life leads to overpopulation, which leads to famine, spreading of diseases, and many other causes of death. So saving some lives indirectly kills much more lives. [Overpopulation effects.](http://www.everythingconnects.org/overpopulation-effects.html)
1.1.4.1.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.2.1.
1.1.4.1.2.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.2.2.
1.1.4.1.2.4.2. Con: These groups are often, at least politically, unwilling to support those lives after they are born. Their supposed devotion to the preservation of life is flawed.
1.1.4.1.2.4.2.1. Con: Evidence suggests otherwise, [adoption](https://adoption.com/catholic/), [health, education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_charities) and [poverty](http://www.catholicsocialteaching.org.uk/themes/human-dignity/resources/encyclical-statements-poverty-2/) are a few of the many societal problems the Catholic Church and many other Christian denominations fully embrace.
1.1.4.1.2.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.1.2.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: [Celibacy](https://www.medicaldaily.com/popes-celibacy-rule-how-abstinence-affects-priests-psychological-health-244715) can be a detrimental form of control.
1.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Celibacy can have a negative impact on mental health and may be a contributing factor in sexual abuse.
1.1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: Among some religious creeds, [child abuse and neglect](https://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/the_sad_twisted_truth_about_conservative_christianitys_effect_on_the_mind_partner/) is more common when certain variables are found: authoritarianism, isolation and fear.
1.1.4.1.3.1.2. Pro: Sexual abuse carried out by priests creates deep trauma in the victims.
1.1.4.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: Several religious schools are filled with accusations of child [abuse](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/child-abuse-catholic-schools-ireland). In Ireland girls were sexually abused in catholic schools. In Canada the United Church committed numerous physical [abuses](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/02/world/indian-lawsuits-on-school-abuse-may-bankrupt-canada-churches.html) against indigenous children.  Christian run schools [prohibited](https://sojo.net/articles/time-acknowledgement-christian-run-native-american-boarding-schools-left-legacy-destruction) native children to speak their languages and continue with their cultural practices. All over the world there are legal proceedings against priests who run religious schools and abused the children that attended them.
1.1.4.1.3.1.3. Pro: Sexual abstinence is not per se unhealthy but it can be [psychologically harmful](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2014/07/07/is-abstinence-unhealthy) when an individual wishes to have sex and does not, according to researchers.
1.1.4.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Studies have found that [regular sex](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2014/07/07/is-abstinence-unhealthy) has a protective effect on the heart, lowering the risk of heart attack in men. For men and women, “it increases blood flow to the genitals and probably helps the immune system”.
1.1.4.1.3.1.3.2. Pro: Psychotherapist and former Benedictine priest A.W. Richard Sipe wrote about the great loneliness, depression, and emotional distress that can come from struggling with [prolonged celibacy](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/examining-crisis/reality-celibate-life-reflections-henri-nouwen).
1.1.4.1.3.1.3.3. Pro: Richard Sipe conducted a [study](https://www.medicaldaily.com/popes-celibacy-rule-how-abstinence-affects-priests-psychological-health-244715) of US celibate Catholic clerics \(1960 to 1985\), and found that half of all priests and  brothers were [sexually](http://www.awrsipe.com/Articles/Knowledge%20of%20sexual%20activity.html) active at any particular time. Masturbation was the most frequent sexual activity, followed by affairs with women, sex with male companions, and Internet pornography.
1.1.4.1.3.1.4. Pro: A conservative Irish newspaper proposed that celibacy had [contributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_on_the_causes_of_clerical_child_abuse) to the abuse problem within the church and an Australian public inquiry panel claimed that priests being celibate may have also contributed to abuse.
1.1.4.1.3.1.5. Pro: A [report](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/catholic-sexual-abuse-partly-caused-by-celibacy-and-secrecy-report-finds), which looked at the findings of 26 royal commissions and other inquiries from Australia, Ireland, the UK, Canada and the Netherlands since 1985, found that mandatory celibacy and a culture of secrecy contributed to minors sexual abuse.
1.1.4.1.3.1.5.1. Pro: A report estimated about [7% of clergy](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/catholic-sexual-abuse-partly-caused-by-celibacy-and-secrecy-report-finds) had abused children between about 1950 and 2000.
1.1.4.1.3.1.6. Con: John Jay researchers reported that about 4 % of the 110,000 priests studied had been accused of sexual misconduct involving children. There is no consensus about the sexual abuse among the general American male population, but estimates are 1 in 10 men or close to 5% and thus [the rate of abuse by Catholic priests is not higher](http://www.newsweek.com/priests-commit-no-more-abuse-other-males-70625) than the national estimates.
1.1.4.1.3.1.6.1. Con: The study was "[authorized and is being paid for by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops](http://www.newsweek.com/priests-commit-no-more-abuse-other-males-70625)".
1.1.4.1.3.1.6.2. Con: The 4% doesn't account for the accomplices who covered it up. Convicted layers of authority have reached [at least two levels](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/philip-wilson-roman-catholic-church-child-sex-abuse-jail-sentence-australia-newcastle-philip-wilson-a8428171.html) above the initial perpetrator.
1.1.4.1.4. Pro: Religious dedication to the fiction of two-genders/sexes can cause new parents of intersex children to impose that will on their children via surgery.
1.1.4.1.4.1. Con: This is not solely an outcome of religion. Even many mainstream secular scientists and people do not agree with the proposition that the idea of there being only two biological sexes is a "fiction". Social roles, biological sex and gender are complicated social issues across the board.
1.1.4.1.4.2. Pro: -> See discussion #1570: Gender \(the [concept](http://www.med.monash.edu.au/gendermed/sexandgender.html) of masculinity and femininity\) is a social construct.
1.1.4.2. Pro: The experience of faith is profoundly moving and personal. To hand any large organisation such a massive emotional lever is a bad idea.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: It is absolute power that is bound to result in absolute corruption.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: Many organised religions, no matter how they start, end up hierarchical and manipulative.
1.1.4.3. Con: There are definitely laws and political systems that invade and control many aspects of one's private life.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: Democratic governments have a mandate to control what citizens have decided governments must control.
1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: Religion also receives the same mandate as democracy since people worship voluntarily.
1.1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.5.3.
1.1.4.3.1.2. Con: All laws and political systems are not democratic.
1.1.4.3.1.3. Con: Not all citizens might have had a say in what aspects of their lives the government has decided it must control.
1.1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: In representative governments citizens do not vote on laws, they only vote on the people who make them.
1.1.4.4. Con: Religion can emancipate and liberate the human mind from other forms of social control.
1.1.4.4.1. Con: Replacing one form of social control with another is not liberation or emancipation.
1.1.4.4.2. Pro: Religion can help emancipate oneself from [capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13789119-economy-of-desire).
1.1.4.4.2.1. Con: That Christianity can [provide](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13789119-economy-of-desire) "resources for faithfully navigate the postmodern global economy" does not mean religion can make someone escape capitalism.
1.1.4.4.2.1.1. Pro: [Christianity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Role_of_Christianity_in_civilization) played a role in the creation and adoption of [capitalism](https://acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-10-number-3/how-christianity-created-capitalism).
1.1.4.4.3. Pro: Religion can reduce [death anxiety](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10851385-unclean).
1.1.4.4.3.1. Con: There are many who do not fear death. Nonexistence is nothing to fear and many have come to see this.
1.1.4.4.3.1.1. Con: There's a difference between having death anxiety and fear of death. Death anxiety is crippling malaise that has far-reaching consequences in how you live, perceive your life and treat others. Not fearing death at all, on the other hand, is a luxuourious delusion for people who have never felt the gut-wrenching totality of basic, creaturely will-to-live.
1.1.4.4.3.2. Pro: Religion comforts people from the inevitability of death.
1.1.4.4.3.2.1. Con: It might be healthier to get over the fear of death and nonexistence all together rather than convince someone it is not the end.
1.1.4.4.3.2.2. Pro: Strong faith can lead people to believe in an afterlife, offering them immeasurable comfort in their final days.
1.1.4.4.3.2.2.1. Con: Being content with suffering and death in the hopes of an afterlife may cause some to resign to defeat.
1.1.4.4.3.2.3. Pro: Religion can bring comfort to the relatives of the recently deceased.
1.1.4.4.3.2.3.1. Con: This could be seen as preying on people when they are at their weakest.
1.1.4.4.3.2.4. Con: Religion is an institutionalization of the fear of death that we, humans, have as a consequence of our deeper intelligence. In honor to that intelligence that allow us to perceive and fear death, and therefore create gods and praise them, we can also take another step forward, banishing the institution of religion from the empiric realm of the fear of death. We are grown enough as a species to accept we are scared of the end of our lives, and that religion is a social construct.
1.1.4.4.4. Pro: Religion usually contain all steps needed to expose and surpass the limits of [mental slavery.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7-ways-emancipate-yourself-from-mental-slavery-brigette-hyacinth)
1.1.4.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.5.3.
1.1.4.5. Con: Religion is not mandatory, it's optional.
1.1.5. Pro: Religious dogma can block exploration of personal spiritual development
1.1.5.1. Pro: Some Christian [denominations](https://mumbailaity.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/yoga-what-the-catechism-says/), for example, claim that [meditation](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19891015_meditazione-cristiana_en.html) or [yoga](https://www.catholic.org/news/health/story.php?id=59107) are esoteric and do not bring practicioners close to God, even though science has proven that they have many [benefits](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/feeling-it/201309/20-scientific-reasons-start-meditating-today).
1.1.5.1.1. Con: [Catholics](https://www.catholic.org/news/health/story.php?id=59107) should not participate in any of the "spiritual" aspects associated with yoga, but technically can do the actual physical exercises.
1.1.5.1.2. Con: Eastern Catholic/[Orthodox](https://oca.org/orthodoxy/the-orthodox-faith/spirituality/prayer-fasting-and-almsgiving/meditation) churches also practice forms of meditation.
1.1.5.2. Con: A dogma is only a marker for what constitutes a necessary belief in any given system. You can't be a christian who don't believe that Jesus is the son of God, because believing that is what constitutes being a christian. Likewise you can't be an atheist who believes in God, because not believing in God is the sole criterion for being an atheist. Dogma does not block spiritual development, it merely categorises it.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Faith is a closed-ended inquiry. No learning is possible if you already decided the answer beforehand.
1.1.5.3.1. Con: Faith is not closed minded, nor is it inactive - it takes effort to believe in something that can't be demonstrated or isn't totally based in logic.
1.1.5.4. Con: Religious dogma can be used as structure for building a stable and fulfilled life. There is nothing that says dogma is necessarily enforced top-down.
1.1.5.4.1. Con: Most organized [religions](https://www.hierarchystructure.com/islam-religious-hierarchy/) are to some [degree](https://www.hierarchystructure.com/judaism-social-hierarchy/) [hierarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_the_Catholic_Church) and dogma is indeed enforced top-down.
1.1.5.5. Con: Religion can be viewed as a shared and negotiated spirituality.
1.1.5.5.1. Pro: Much like language: [creole languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language), stable natural languages developed from a mixture of different languages to become a native language, are negotiated.
1.1.5.5.2. Con: "[Religion](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/68747/the-etymology-of-religion-comes-from-legere-meaning-to-read-re-meaning-a)" comes from Latin and suggests a commitment, either written or spoken, to a group or cannon, that would be binding and to that extent non-negotiable.
1.1.5.5.3. Pro: Much like science is a negotiated understanding of how things are, a religion can be viewed as a negotiated understanding of how we should act in the world.
1.1.5.5.3.1. Con: Religion teaches us how we should act in the world if we want to go to heaven. Given that "going to heaven" is a meditative process one can't engage when dead, it is an uncertain reward.
1.1.5.5.3.1.1. Con: Heaven and hell can be viewed as conceptions of your potential future. By designing your own heaven \(desired future\) to [strive for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system) and your own hell \(unwanted future\) [to avoid](http://integratedleader.com/articles/Importance_Fear.pdf), you are essentially [maximizing your motivation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9pTz2_utU4) by using two different motivational systems.
1.1.5.5.3.1.1.1. Con: Heaven and Hell is a bipolar system based on fear, which suggest to do good things to avoid hell and not do bad things to go to heaven. It's an amoral system.
1.1.5.5.3.1.1.2. Con: However, "your own heaven" and "your own hell" are not what religion promote. Religions generally preempt the creation of, or usurp people's versions of, heaven or hell. Thus, led by religion, people may end up in the religion's idea of heaven, which to them may be far from optimal. For instance religion and pregnancy may lead someone to marry and settle down where they're more suited to an outrageously dangerous lifestyle with nobody left to grieve if they die.
1.1.5.5.3.1.1.2.1. Con: This is an Abraham-centric generalization of "religion."  Taoism, Confucianism, Hinduism, and Buddhism provide frameworks for a person to understand their relationship with their self, the people around them, and the world around them, and the purpose of these relationships. An argument about the utility of religion cannot simply cast aside half of the world's religious history as if it is irrelevant.
1.1.5.5.3.1.2. Con: Religious beliefs — notably belief in hell, heaven, and an afterlife — tend to increase [economic growth](https://www.hoover.org/research/religion-and-economic-development). Religious beliefs are found to "raise productivity by fostering individual traits such as honesty, work ethic, and thrift".
1.1.5.5.3.1.2.1. Con: Maybe \(if this is true\) the work ethic increases to make up for giving too much to the collection tray/box or because for the N people in a church N-1 are productive members of society. One just talks and consumes.
1.1.5.5.3.1.2.2. Con: The parent's linked article is high on theory but has zero numbers. It states that it's speculating and raising the question, not drawing the conclusion. It is not support, but elaboration, leaving the parent unsupported.
1.1.5.5.3.1.2.3. Con: At the cost of freedom: a workforce that lives under the threat of "hell" or some equivalent adverse effect which is unfounded.
1.1.5.5.3.2. Con: It is not a fair comparison. The scientific method is totally different from how religion has come to be. The idea of a "negotiated understanding of how we should act" is an idealization of how religion spawned.
1.1.5.5.4. Con: [The Gospel of Thomas](http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gthlamb.html), logion 114, shows that mithraic christianity has been gender politics, for the most part, for the last 2000 years.
1.1.5.5.5. Con: Religions are originally dictated by their god\(s\) through the religious books. The word of God is not negotiable
1.1.5.5.5.1. Con: Gods are human creations that represents archetypes and role models which survived multiple generations through storytelling.
1.1.5.5.5.1.1. Con: Even if we were to assume that gods were only human creations, the words of the religious books exists and their commandments are empowered by the religious entities.
1.1.5.5.5.2. Pro: Younger generations do not feel like they are part of the negotiation, because most religions were settled before they were born.
1.1.5.5.5.3. Pro: Many people believe that God actually exist, and decide to follow the religious dogma without negotiation.
1.1.5.5.5.4. Con: Religious texts are a meditative experience of heaven originally experienced by a prophet or messiah and then interpreted and articulated by them, including human failings: in that sense, the Word is negotiable
1.1.5.5.5.4.1. Pro: For example, in Judaism, the ‘[Midrash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash#Forms_of_Midrashic_literature)’ is a type of rabbinic literature in which rabbis interpret and comment the Torah and other religious laws. The purpose of this is to resolve problems and find a common understanding, therefore showing a negotiation process.
1.1.5.5.5.4.1.1. Pro: [Contemporary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash#Forms_of_Midrashic_literature) forms of 'midrash' include literature and artwork to facilitate the interpretation of sacred texts. According to some scholars 'midrash' can also be used to “update” or “enhance” sacred texts, thus being a form of rewriting them in a way that  makes them "more acceptable to later ethical standards" and renders what is less obviously implausible.
1.1.5.5.5.4.2. Con: The texts are considered to be the Word of God \(to the prophet/author\) by the followers of the religion, therefore, they are not negotiable.
1.1.5.5.6. Con: Even leaders of many religions will tell you that what people get from their religion will vary from person to person. Thus viewing religion as a shared spirituality is an inaccurate perception.
1.1.5.6. Pro: There are virtually an infinity of ways for spiritual development \(each person can have his own\). When following one specific dogma, you can't explore the other ways and can't decide by your own experience which one is best for you.
1.1.5.6.1. Con: An infinite number of ways is more ways than a person has time to explore in a lifetime, religion narrows the field to a smaller subset of infinite ways, which are still more ways than a person can explore in their life.
1.1.5.6.2. Con: The point of religion is to show and teach people the "correct" way \(whatever each religion feels the correct way is\). Allowing individualism runs counter to this, as it is by definition, not the "correct" way.
1.1.5.6.2.1. Con: Religion and individualism are not mutually exclusive
1.1.5.6.2.2. Pro: Thousand of years of developing a particular theory will most of the time have more wisdom and useful knowledge than what a single individual can produce.
1.1.5.6.3. Pro: Spiritual development is never a collective task. The collective task should be supporting the spiritual development of its members. Religion is actually a tool to sanction spiritual development as it establishes its boundaries.
1.1.6. Con: Some people need to uphold the belief in someone greater to deal with their problems, this should not be a problem. It is a valid way of dealing with life as long as it does not interfere with the lives of others. The problem starts when religion begins to be imposed on people.
1.1.7. Con: Today's legal system came from religion and is one of the many benefits of organized religion. Yes there may have been power struggles, dogma and hyprocrisy. If it was not for the roman empire spreading democracy, we would not have the systems of government we know today. Christianity made a significant positive contribution to the development of modern democracy. [academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/36002782/Christianity_and_Democracy_A_Cross-Cultural_Study_Afterthoughts_)
1.1.7.1. Con: Today's legal system did not come from Christianity, and religion has little direct impact. For Europe, the Magna Carta marks the beginning of rights spreading from the select upper class to the general populace and was not a religious document.
1.1.7.1.1. Con: The Magna Carta had important Christian ties as demonstrated by its preamble that began, “John, by the grace of God…,” and stated that the charter was formulated out of “reverence for God and for the salvation of our soul and those of all our ancestors and heirs, for the honour of God and the exaltation of Holy Church and the reform of our realm, on the advice of our reverend \[church\] fathers” \(Schmidt 251\).[crossandquill.com](http://crossandquill.com/journey/the-influence-of-christianity-on-western-civilization/)
1.1.7.2. Con: The cited research is not research at all but a specious attempt to make broad conclusions look like research by embedding numbers into a table that shows nothing to support the author's thesis.
1.1.8. Con: Dogma, power, and hypocrisy are not unique to organized religions, but exist in any social organization.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Religion is not synonymous with power struggle or hypocrisy. There is nothing inherent in religion which causes it to seek power or cause the religious to disregard the religion's laws but teach them anyway. Religion asserts certain ideas to be true. Believing that one thing is true does not cause you to seek power over people believing differently - it is possible for people to respect opinions. Believing in a spiritual idea does not cause you to be a hypocrite either.
1.1.9. Con: Some organized religions claim anti-dogmatism as one of their tenants. For example, one of the most fundamental teachings of the Buddha, as most forms of organized Buddhism claim to believe, was to reject dogma and adopt a critical orientation towards the world and oneself.
1.1.9.1. Con: [Buddhism](http://www.sapphyr.net/buddhist/buddhist-core.htm) has [dogma](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dogma).
1.1.9.1.1. Con: [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_\(Buddhism\)) does not demand blind belief and allow for a vast continuum of interpretations. It embraces the individual's path to truth and makes it clear that dogma does not supersede personal conscience and experience.
1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: The path is till guided by basic tenets and doctrines \(which are fundamental to the idea of dogma in terms of religion\).
1.1.9.1.1.1.1. Con: The key difference is that in most religions, dogmas are doctrines that are “[unquestionably true](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dogma)” and generally “[authoritatively proclaimed](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dogma)”. If a religion has tenets but they are not mandatory or unquestionable, one can consider them not dogmatic.
1.1.9.1.1.2. Pro: When a person takes on [The Five Precepts](https://tricycle.org/magazine/the-five-precepts/), they are left to the rationalization and justification of the individual. Example: The First Precept is to abstain from taking life. Is it ethical to take the life of one person who is intent on taking the life of another? The individual has to decide and live with the consequences of such decision.
1.1.9.1.2. Con: Buddhism, for example, does not provide strict and unanimous moral teachings on issues like [abortion](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml), [death penalty](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/capitalpunishment.shtml) or [euthanasia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/euthanasiasuicide.shtml).
1.1.9.1.2.1. Pro: Buddhism has never held views against [homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_and_sexual_orientation) and Buddha's teachings do not condemn non-reproductive [sex](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/contraception.shtml).
1.1.9.1.2.1.1. Con: Buddhism doesn't specifically make statements about sex other than to "not misuse" sexuality.
1.1.9.1.3. Pro: The [Pāli Canon](http://palicanon.org) is certainly [dogma](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dogma) in both definition 1 and 2. The Canon is a central authority and foundational to Buddhism.
1.2. Con: Religion can provide certainty, hope, unity and a sense of continuity in changing times.
1.2.1. Pro: In a changing world, religion provides a sense of continuity
1.2.1.1. Con: Religion is primarily a divisive rather than a uniting practice in society.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Christianity has particularly provided some increased division of issues such as LGBTQ+ rights, sexual choice, and abortion rights.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Buddhist leadership and controversy over the next Dalai Lama is an up-and-coming issue that is divisive, particularly with China's own input on the matter.
1.2.2. Pro: Religion can bring a sense of hope and inspiration to people.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Martin Luther King Jr. was famous for religious rhetoric, which [fantastically pervaded many of his writings and speeches](http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive).
1.2.2.1.1. Con: Martin Luther King Jr. is not a good example of a religious role model due to his [deception](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/four-things-about-king/) and [sexual impropriety](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41871956).
1.2.3. Con: It can also provide the opposite.
1.2.4. Pro: -> See discussion #8539: Religion has been a good thing for humankind.
1.2.5. Pro: Religion can provide social cohesion.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Religion is extremely important in small, rural, or poverty stricken communities and are responsible for creating an element of community. Unfortunately, once you enter most first world countries, those benefits melt away, and there simply exploited for personal gain, but go somewhere like Zambia, and you'll get a very different perception.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Religion provides a community for some people where they are with others that share the same beliefs who allows them to feel that they are not alone.
1.2.5.3. Con: It more often provide social rift.
1.2.6. Con: Religion helps you feel that justice will always be served by god and you will be rewarded for your good deeds. It is inherently dangerous as it incentivize good deeds when those should be supported by the conviction of it being the only way to make our world a better place. Instead, believing in god's justice leave criminals free such as in the case of[catholic church sexual abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases)
1.2.7. Con: Religions quite probably provide false hope which is worse than no hope at all.
1.2.7.1. Con: Hope can be a motivating factor to improve, to fight and to resist and so having hope \(even if it based on false premises\) may still be beneficial.
1.2.8. Con: Rational human being should be able to find all of those from people close tho them e.g. family and friends. Scientific research can help us accept the fleeting nature of life and appreciate those moments given to us.
1.2.9. Con: Religion is just a replaceable psychological support providing a sense of meaning, progress and security in daily life. Seen as a tool, it has many unwanted side effects when compared to philosophy, psychotherapy and other useful tools based on unbiased observation and research.
1.3. Con: Religion has moral and life lessons to imbue upon its adherents.
1.3.1. Con: Religions, however, tend to end up competing against each other, leading to moral and, by extension, political conflict.
1.3.2. Pro: Many religions teach humility and honesty.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Buddhism is one such example.
1.3.3. Pro: Religion and spirituality bring people closer to God.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Like all rivers in the world merges with the vast oceans on the Earth in the same way all religions on the Earth are a way to Higher Almighty God. Religions are paths to lead the human civilizations to the ultimate high soul. If it is banned then we are closing the ways for the human civilizations to reach the almighty God.
1.3.3.2. Con: Not all religions are focused on "God."
1.3.3.3. Con: God doesn't exist. They are encouraged to worship something that references nothing. This is the essence of idolatry, which the Bible forbids. So from a biblical perspective, at least Judaeo-Christian religion\(s\) should be banned.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: The celestial Santa Claus hypothesis is so unlikely to be true that it should be dismissed as an option until further evidence presents itself. To cast this into policy would make this easier to move to higher definitions of truth with actual objects attached.
1.3.3.3.2. Con: God, [in the Spinozan sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinozism), surely exists, therefore we should seek to exchange definitions and reject celestial grandfather notions. "Celestial grandfather" being defined as any set of attributes or definitions for deity approaching an anthropomorphic, localized, wish or curse casting entity.
1.3.3.3.3. Con: From a biblical perspective or Judaeo Christian perspective, Idols are other Gods created by man that are worshiped as a substitute for the God of the bible, or the God of Isaac, or the God of Abraham and Moses. They all teach that only one God exists \(the prophets believed God exists\) and any other Gods are false Gods. Therefore religion should not be banned from a Judaeo Christian or biblical perspective. For the bible says God exists.
1.3.4. Pro: Religion can create a pathway to deeper understanding and connection to the world around us.
1.3.5. Con: Absolutely no religion needed If one can live every day as a good, conscientious human being; having sympathy, empathy, unselfishness and care for all living things on this planet. If at the end of the day one can look in the mirror and say that you were the best human being that you could be that day then you'll sleep in peace every evening. No religion needed to practice being a good human.
1.3.6. Con: They are not mutually inclusive. Aesop's fables teach many lessons without being religious, and morals do not need threats of hellfire, brimstone, and pillars of salt to be effective.
1.3.7. Con: Our conception of moral is inherited from our religions. What is moral from a religious perspective is not necessarily right from a humanist perspective. Moral is the definition of good/wrong behaviour, but we might not agree on its [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality). Moral can exist without religion.
1.3.8. Con: There are many calls to murder in the Bible.
1.3.9. Pro: Religion promotes faith, which is a good characteristic and trait to teach children, even if when they are older they do not believe in the religion itself.
1.3.10. Pro: If religion were to be defined as a set of answers to the big questions \(which is, at least in part\) this may lead man to simply ignore the great questions of life, discourage thought, or reduce the value of human existence \(at least on a global scale\).
1.3.11. Con: More people might learn morality is largely subjective based on the culture we live in, leading to less hate. It is taught to everyone but atheists don't follow it to please god\(s\) or avoid his/her punishment.
1.4. Pro: Religion is detrimental to human progress.
1.4.1. Pro: Religions are keeping us chained to the notion that [freewill](https://www.kialo.com/free-will-or-determinism-do-we-have-free-will-5685/5685.0=5685.1/=5685.1) exists because it's the only answer they have for the problem of evil.
1.4.1.1. Pro: [Freewill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t_Uyi9bNS4) doesn't exist.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #5685: There is no free will.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: This oversimplification is dodging a very complex nuanced conversation with no cut and dried conclusions. From G. E. Moore: "For hard determinism to be correct, there must be NO meaning of "could" \(or "can"\) according to which a person could/can do other than x when the person actually did x. Since we CAN sometimes do other than x when we actually do x, hard determinism is wrong." [Taken from analysis of G.E. Moore's position on hard determinism here.](http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/web%20publishing/Determinism_&_Free_Will.htm)
1.4.1.2. Con: Some religions are even incoherent in the fact that they admit freewill but also say that everything is written like [predestination in Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination_in_Islam).
1.4.1.2.1. Con: It's possible to have free will and predestination. The article states that predestination is God knowing what choices will land you in hell or heaven as opposed to God choosing for you. He can can predict what will happen to a person based on the choices a person will make. This type of predestination or prophesy, is no different to predicting a child burning their hand on a fire. Drowning in water.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: [Institutes 3.21.5](http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/Calvin%20Institutes%20of%20Christian%20Religion.pdf#iv.iii.xxii) Calvin said that "when we attribute prescience to God, we mean that all things always were, and ever continue, under his eye; that to his knowledge there is no past or future, but all things are present... \[But\] by predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation."
1.4.2. Pro: Religion denies humanity the responsibility of Morality and wants to shackle us to itself in doing so.
1.4.2.1. Pro: By asserting dominion over Morality, Religion inhibits and hinders Humanity's growth potential.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. There could be instances where religion has aided human growth, the idea of the "Protestant Work Ethic" for example.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Con: [Protestant work ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_work_ethic#Criticism) or the idea that large-scale industrial capitalism was ideologically impossible before the Reformation is exploded by the simple fact that it existed.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Morality can and should be anchored in [science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj9oB4zpHww). That is to say that moral questions can and must be answered by Science. We don't need Religion to get answers.
1.4.2.2.1. Con: Science is often indeterminate and is constantly evolving as our capabilities grow. Morality is a very time pertinent set of rules and cannot wait for the science to be sorted out.
1.4.2.2.2. Con: There are questions that science cannot and should not attempt to answer.
1.4.2.2.2.1. Pro: Eugenics and forced sterilization are scientific answers to the problem of poor genetics being passed on.
1.4.2.2.2.2. Pro: Any question that involves human dignity and autonomy requires an ethical approach that cannot be trivialized to a scientific principle; questions about [medical tests](http://www.auschwitz.dk/mengele.htm) and[experimentation](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm), [genetic](http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotechnology/glenn.html) manipulation and disciplines that impact the [environment](https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/environmental-consequences) are just a few examples of these.
1.4.2.2.2.3. Con: A rigorous scientific approach may not easily solve ethical problems, but it can provide optimal and 'correct' solutions that may arguably be better for 'humanity' than some religions.
1.4.2.2.2.4. Con: Dr. Mengele performed [valuable](https://www.nbiadisorders.org/about-nbia/overview-of-nbia-disorders) research and provided effective test material that religion had traditionally prevented from taking place.
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: [Neurophilosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurophilosophy) a fascinating new field of research is, so far, in support of a [biological origin for morality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcXKBf48Tf4).
1.4.2.3. Pro: We are at a point where we can no more respect and tolerate, vast differences in notions about the well-being of sentient creatures \(morality\), than we can respect and tolerate vast differences in the notions of how disease spreads, or safety standards in buildings and airplanes. 

We simply must converge, it's a question of survival.
1.4.2.3.1. Con: This does not necessitate converging into a society based strictly on a system of secular ethics.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Be it Relativism, Natural Law, Categorical Imperative, Divine Command, etc. The need for convergence is no less urgent if we are to survive as a species.
1.4.3. Pro: Faith is to reason what concussion is to a brain, the resulting state of a shock, the shock in question is when a mind first experiences the [Absurd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism), the epistemological inability to grapple with the paradoxes of Existence and Death.
1.4.3.1. Pro: That is what "[Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation)" is, the experiencing of the absurd.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The actual "experience" of the Absurd, of Revelation, is very real and profoundly disturbing. You can't blame people for reacting with Faith to this experience, like you can't blame someone for using crutches after breaking a leg but you can question them for clutching at those crutches for the rest of their lives...
1.4.4. Pro: Religions will no longer hold back social or scientific  progress.
1.4.4.1. Con: That may depend on the definition of progress.
1.4.4.2. Con: If we banned religion, religious individuals would likely revolt against whatever regime did this. Vast resources would be needed to quell the masses, detracting us from investing in scientific pursuits.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: Followed by the development of other superstitions -- like homeopathy.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: This would just push religion underground. Would manifest on the surface in similar ways to now.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Getting rid of attempts towards getting Creationism or Noah's Ark into science textbooks would be a great win for education.
1.4.4.4. Pro: Ending institutional support for "magical thinking" will perhaps sway a larger swath of humanity towards rational thinking, particularly as older generations pass away.
1.4.4.5. Con: Religion and Science can be compatible.
1.4.4.5.1. Pro: [Georges Lemaître](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lemaître), the father of the [Big Bang Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang), was a Catholic priest, and an astronomer, and professor of physics at the Catholic University of Leuven. He would be proof that religion and science can co-exist, and those that are devout in any sort of religion can also make endeavors in science as well.
1.4.5. Con: Without God, there can be no objective measurement of what 'human progress' is.
1.4.5.1. Con: Human progress as a measurement from God would be subjective to God, not objective, as there is a lot of personal input going into a belief in God, and to follow such a belief is on a subjective prose.
1.4.5.2. Con: Progress can be depicted without any sort of dogmatic principles put in place.
1.4.5.3. Con: Since the concept of God relies upon personal experience alone, it cannot be objective by definition.
1.4.6. Con: Religion provides solace to humans upon the death of a loved one.
1.4.6.1. Con: Solace is not related to progress. Human progress can continue when one is comfortable and when one is not.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: Solace can help people recover from trauma, quickening their return to functioning and thus contribution to the world.
1.4.6.2. Con: People being uncomfortable losing someone might be a motivation for innovating ways to keep people alive longer and in better health.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: Losing someone can result in much more than simply being "uncomfortable." It can be highly debilitating and even incapacitating.
1.4.6.2.1.1. Con: The debilitating and incapacitating effects of losing a loved one can be made worse if one thinks their loved one is being tortured in hell for all eternity.
1.4.6.2.2. Pro: There is nothing frightening about returning to nothingness or oblivion. It is comforting to know that there is absolutely zero chance that your loved one will be subjected to eternal torture from a benevolent, just and loving god.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Many people take comfort in religious ideas of people still "existing" or "being alive" via supernatural forces \(becoming a spirit, becoming one with the world, looking down from heaven, etc.\)
1.4.6.3.1. Con: They could also be looking up from Hell, writhing in eternal agony merely for the crime of not doing a public song and dance pledging allegiance to a hell-creating god.
1.4.6.4. Con: Solace is not solely the domain of religion and can be sought through therapy and counselling.
1.4.6.4.1. Con: Religion is generally free- there is no cost of attendance, for prayer, blessings, etc.- and thus more financially accessible than therapy and counseling.
1.4.6.5. Con: Religion also provides an infinite punishment for finite crimes. Far more comforting, in the secular view, is the zero chance of your loved one being mercilessly tortured after death for all eternity for finite crimes.
1.4.7. Pro: Lack of religion can encourage free thinking and more rationality.
1.4.7.1. Con: Faith is not inherently irrational.
1.4.7.1.1. Con: [Rationa](https://www.google.com/search?q=rational)l: the quality of being based on or in accordance with reason or logic. Faith:firm belief in something for which there is no proof These are by definition mutually exclusive when applied to the same situation. [Faith](https://www.google.com/search?q=faith) is the antithesis of reason.
1.4.7.1.1.1. Con: [Faith](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faith) is not defined as believing in something with no proof. It is simply defined as believing in something strongly.
1.4.7.1.1.1.1. Con: The second definition in the link given says exactly that it is believing with no proof.
1.4.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The lack of proof has no bearing on whether or not someone can have faith in something.
1.4.7.1.1.2. Con: By the logic of faith being a belief in something with no proof, one stating that they have faith in the science of a peer-reviewed study would not be a very valid statement.
1.4.7.1.1.2.1. Con: It is a straw man to criticize people for saying they have faith in science. One does not have faith in science or in reason.
1.4.7.1.1.2.1.1. Con: People have strong convictions towards science and to reason, based on the prose presented by both, and therefore hold faith in both doctrines.
1.4.7.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: There is abundant evidence that science and reason work in the real world. Therefore to believe that they work is not faith based. Having strong conviction is not enough to classify something as faith.
1.4.7.1.1.3. Con: [Logic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logic) is not dependent on "proof." One can be perfectly logical without providing data or physical evidence. Therefore, being [faithful](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faith) and being [rational](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational) are not mutually exclusive.
1.4.7.1.1.3.1. Con: [Logic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logics), is as the definition linked to states, a science. It uses induction and deduction to reach conclusions based on available knowledge and evidence. Making conclusions based on unsubstantiated claims is illogical.
1.4.7.1.2. Con: Faith is an abdication of rationality, it's belief without \(and often against\) knowledge or proof.
1.4.7.1.2.1. Con: Belief without proof is not inherently irrational.
1.4.7.1.2.1.1. Con: A belief without evidence is not a reasonable belief, because there is no rational cause for the perception to exist. A belief that goes against reason is by definition irrational.
1.4.7.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Evidence is not always necessary to form a reasonable belief- one merely experiences the world and tries to form logical explanations for it.
1.4.7.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: By forming a logical explanation from an experience one must be using reason and rationality.
1.4.7.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: World experience is a form of anecdotal evidence
1.4.7.1.2.1.1.1.3. Con: A reasonable belief is, by definition, formed through reasons, evidence or justifications. Evidence is often defined as: "grounds for belief". A true belief with justification is knowledge \[ according to the ancient Greeks anyway \].
1.4.7.1.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen". [Hebrews 11:1 King James Version \(KJV\)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+11%20%3A1&version=KJV).
1.4.7.1.2.1.2. Con: From the definition of reason \(which implies the meaning of rational\): a cause, explanation, or justification for an action or event.
1.4.7.2. Pro: In absence of irrational religious beliefs for them to hold on to, people will have no choice but to look at rational approach for explanations.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: Reason does not ride in on the vanishing coattails of religion.The opposite of religion, irrational or whatever, is not reason -- it's simply non-religion. Still other irrational beliefs and crazy mechanisms are even now waiting in the wings -- if history is any indicator of human tendencies.
1.4.7.2.2. Con: Assuming that people no longer hold "irrational religious beliefs", it is still possible that people hold irrational beliefs.
1.4.7.3. Con: The ground floor of irrational thought in humans is not religion. These are evolved tendencies and as such, must be admitted to have had adaptive benefits at some point in human development.
1.4.7.3.1. Con: That religion is not the source of irrational thought does not imply that it does not increase irrational thought or decrease rational thought.
1.4.7.3.1.1. Pro: Just as expressing anger can strengthen neural pathways for anger, increasing frequency -- expressing a belief in supernatural forces strengthens the neural pathways for belief without evidence.
1.4.7.3.2. Con: It is important to admit religion's role in the past and how it has shaped our world but Human beings are no longer ignorant of our world Science allows us to understand and survive in far better ways than religion has ever done.
1.4.7.3.2.1. Con: Admission of religion's role in the past as well as the recognition of science as a better method for understanding nature and improving human survival does not lead to banning religion as a method for increasing global levels of rational thinking. There is little evidence leading to this as a workable solution and thus, a ban is itself not scientific. It is simply tribalism .....yet again. This thesis proposes as a solution what it seeks to abolish.
1.4.7.3.2.1.1. Pro: Separation of church and state is all that is needed to theoretically stop religion from interfering with science since it removes its authority. As such there is no reason to think that any further measures are necessary to safeguard science.
1.4.7.4. Pro: Religions prevent people from reasoning freely as they're based on dogmas which are by definition incontrovertibly true. Therefore believing in a religion reduces liberty of thought, as religions generally don't tolerate the questioning of their fundaments.
1.4.7.4.1. Con: One may believe in a religion because one agrees with its dogma. Thus, an individual's free thought has led them to their belief by questioning that religion before joining.
1.4.7.4.2. Pro: It would be naive to think that religion is a free personal choice. Cases where people chose theirs are exceptions. For the rest of cases, religions is inherited either from one's family, cultural background or social environment, which would makes one's free thought on this matter even more difficult due to peer/social pressure.
1.4.7.4.2.1. Con: Likewise, one's thoughts would be dictated to a more secular thinking and subjective to the same departments \(one's family, cultural background, or social environment\). One would still be influenced by these same factors to believe in a secular belief, negating free thought once again, based on the idea that one's own free thoughts within a religion is solely based on these proponents.
1.4.7.4.3. Con: Religions do tolerate the questioning of their fundaments.
1.4.7.4.4. Con: Prohibiting the expression of religious thoughts is even more restrictive.
1.4.7.5. Con: Rational thinking and religion do not have to negate one another. Only the most fundamentalists alienate themselves from mainstream, secular societies.
1.4.7.6. Pro: Ethical understandings/moral code will evolve in accordance with the relevant context, rather than using outdated codes.
1.4.7.7. Con: For those people for whom religious participation is an essential part of community life, choosing faith is an extremely rational decision. Removing the possibility of this choice will not affect people's rationality, only their communities.
1.4.7.8. Con: Legality, not even existence of religion are going to change how people think.
1.4.7.9. Con: Banning religion would not make people more rational.
1.4.7.9.1. Pro: Banning religion would set many people into strikes, protests, and riots, which would be the opposite of rational thinking. Banning even one religion would have a tremendous amount of outrage and would be extremely oppressive, let alone all religions.
1.4.8. Pro: Religion propagates disinformation that undermines real-world and scientific discoveries.
1.4.8.1. Con: This is refuted by centuries of scientific discoveries with religion, often \(and historically usually\) by religious people.
1.4.8.1.1. Con: Since for most of those centuries, education \(thus knowledge and science\) was under the exclusive dominion of the clergy, this point is rather moot.
1.4.8.1.2. Con: The fact that many scientists were religious or even helped by religious institutions, does not negate the fact that religion has historically opposed scientific discovery that contradicted religious ideas.
1.4.8.1.2.1. Pro: The Catholic church used the [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition#Definition_and_purpose) to prosecute anyone who espoused  views deemed as heretic \(for example, some scientific ideas\) convicting people to different sentences, including death by burning.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1. Con: The [Spanish Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition) is a perfect example of men, in this case the monarchy, defying clear religious doctrine for malicious self interests. It is an example of men abusing authority, not of actual religion abusing people. "Love your neighbor as yourself." Follow Christ, not men falsely claiming to represent Him.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Only the [Spanish Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition) operated completely under the royal Christian authority \(though staffed by clergy\), yet many sentences dictated during Inquisition trials were made within the [judicial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition#Roman_Inquisition) of the Roman Catholic Church.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2. Con: If organized religions are lead by men, and men are bound to malicious self interests, then it is likely that religions often fall prey to nefarious actions against fellow men.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Violence is not what religion is about. Even if you meet a so called 'infidel', violence is not the way to treat a human being.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Many religious teachings promote violence.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Some [Buddhist](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/09/can-anyone-stop-burmas-hardline-buddhist-monks/538992/) and [Abrahamic](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/barcelona-attack-imam-police-investigation-house-explosion-location-islamist-terrorist-plot-las-a7905226.html) clergy commit violence toward their fellow man because they believe their religion requires it.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The vast majority of practitioners and believers in these traditions are good people, and violent vocal minorities do not accurately reflect the majority of people.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: It is not a question of whether it reflects that majority. It is a question of whether it reflects the actual messages of the texts and tenets.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Often because they believe the lies by preachers.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.3. Con: The history of religions is not overloaded with tales of civilians who stand against preachers who are promoting violence but rather with people who stand with those preachers, rational thought set aside, or who stand aside in rational fear.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Some religions also contain scripture that has undoubtably made people less kind towards fellow humans. For example, violence in [Islam](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx) or [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_violence).
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3. Con: Christianity instills values of peace and non-violence.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Christianity [compels](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20&version=NIV) its followers not to kill, commit adultery, or steal.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Contemporary law is not based at all on the 10 commandments. The first four are about god and the sabbath none of which appears in contemporary  western law. Honoring your parents may be expected but is not required. Killing is permitted under certain circumstances \(self defense\). Adultery and coveting goods are not illegal either. Theft and perjury are all that remain.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Even [perjury has been watered down to varying degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury). Generally it can only be illegal if you're lying to the police or under oath.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: One of the 10 commandments is "thou shalt not kill".
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3. Con: Religion has preached intolerance for centuries and persecuted people for just as long, people typically do not want to be persecuted and so it would seem that at least not all religions hold that you should treat all others as you would want to be treated.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Religion has historically had to catch up and modify its morality to fit the changing secular standards. If its moral code was truly beneficial it wouldn't have to play catch up to secular ethics.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: The [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery) was used as both an argument for and against [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_slavery).
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Christian responses to domestic abuse have been catching up to secular standards over the past 40 years. [Many pastors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_domestic_violence#Responses_to_abuse) have said and many continue to say that they would never advise a women to leave an abusive husband, and many advise forgiveness and enduring.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: Recently church leaders such as the Pope and bishops have openly condemned this behavior and with more women pastors entering the ranks the responses are finally catching up to secular standards.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.3. Pro: The [Catholic church molestation scandals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases) show that until pressed by secular authorities religious ones are content to hide their crimes.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: A report estimated about [7% of clergy](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/13/catholic-sexual-abuse-partly-caused-by-celibacy-and-secrecy-report-finds) had abused children between about 1950 and 2000.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.3.2. Con: The Congregation of the[Servants of the Paraclete](http://mtcarmelrenewalcenter.org/about/) was founded in the 1940's by Fr. Gerald Fitzgerald to expose and help prevent child sexual abuse by the clergy.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.3.2.1. Con: Fitzgerald started to assist priests dealing with substance abuse but soon began receiving priests who had sexually abused minors. He did not bring them to justice and was [against secular treatments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_of_the_Servants_of_the_Paraclete) like psychiatry and psychology.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.3.2.2. Con: Fitzgerald recommended some priests to be laicized but, in general, most bishops chose to [ignore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_of_the_Servants_of_the_Paraclete) his recommendations and kept employing priests with sexual abuse history.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.3.2.3. Con: The center was [closed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_of_the_Servants_of_the_Paraclete) in the 1990s as the result of lawsuits over priests who had molested children while staying at the center or after being treated at the facility.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.3.2.4. Con: Abusive priests from all over the US where brought to the Monastery run by the Servants of the Paracletes since 1947. Very often, those priests were released to work with [non-white and poor communities](https://rewire.news/religion-dispatches/2018/08/27/from-pa-to-new-mexico-colonialism-and-the-crisis-inside-the-crisis-of-catholic-sexual-abuse/) and very often sexual abuses continued. In that sense, the church disposed of abusive priest in predominately white and mid-western communities to bring them to poorer and brown communities, without ever truly eradicating sexual abuse.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Fr. Edward Graff \(included in the [Pennsylvania grand jury report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/08/14/pennsylvania-grand-jury-report-on-sex-abuse-in-catholic-church-will-list-hundreds-of-accused-predator-priests/?utm_term=.c90e5d6dca61)\) was moved from Allentown where the report alleges “raped scores of children” to the Monastery. Eventually, in 1980, he was released and worked in Texas and New Mexico until being arrested for [sexually abusing](https://rewire.news/religion-dispatches/2018/08/27/from-pa-to-new-mexico-colonialism-and-the-crisis-inside-the-crisis-of-catholic-sexual-abuse/) a minor. In the investigation, it was discovered he would employ and potentially abuse young and poor Hispanic youth. He died in prison before trial.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.4. Pro: The Catholic church preached as doctrine that the Jews were collectively responsible for [deicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_deicide). This belief fostered two millennia of antisemitism and was only [repudiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_deicide#Repudiation) and removed as doctrine in 1962 during the second Vatican Council. This antisemitism was part of the environment that allowed Hitler's rise.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.5. Con: Secular and religious ethics are vastly intertwined. In religious doctrines you are asked to do good and be good. This doesn't mean that religion introduced these ethics but it did help propagate them.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.5.1. Con: While the set of secular morals/ethics can change and be added to as we learn, religion does not change. That makes religion a barrier to morals and ethics beyond those it subscribes to.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: The bible ends in [68AD](https://ichthys.com/mail-Bible%20chrono.htm), at the end of Revelations, and was finished by Apostle John in [95AD](https://www.biblica.com/resources/bible-faqs/when-was-the-bible-written/) at least 1804 years before any currently living person was born. Nothing was added when we learnt to treat women and men equally, nor when we learnt that cowering is not "yes" and "no" is relevant in marriage, nor when we learnt to treat each others' sexual preferences equally.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: If there is a God he won't have overlooked the morals the bible does. Remember the [story](https://truthbook.com/stories/funny-god/the-drowning-man): A man on a roof in a flood who waits for God to save him and turns down three forms of salvation before drowning. Then God tells him that he sent those three. Religion has ignored much that it could have seen as messages from God over the last 1800 years. There's been more than a rowboat, a motorboat and a helicopter in that time but religion is still not seeing the signs.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.5.2. Con: Secular ethics and religious ethics are distinguished by where they come from. A framework of secular ethics may have the same exact tenets as a religious one and yet be derived in a completely different way. It is also possible for them to have completely differing tenets. The definition of secular ethics is that it is not derived from religion thus the term secular. So without completely redefining the terms we are using it is impossible to say that they are the same.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.5.3. Pro: Even if the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule#Ancient_Egypt) \(treating other as ones would wish to be treated\) was not invented by Christianity, Christianity did make it popular.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.5.3.1. Con: Religion takes claim of things without regard for the original source; often absorbing aspects of subjected people's culture, as a mean to further control and dominate them.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.5.4. Pro: [Scholasticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism) acted as a bridge between Greek and Roman knowledge and Christian theology, as a way of teaching that [focused](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-philosophy/Medieval-philosophy) on "logic, dialectic, and all the scientific disciplines known at the time".
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.5.4.1. Con: The fact that religious people did logical things does not imply that they did it because they were religious.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.6. Con: The higher rate of change of secular ethics does not make them more true. It just means religious ethics move more slowly. This could be a good thing, when the common opinion is changed for the worse.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.6.1. Con: Most religions' primary texts are finalized at some point. After that their ethics don't move slowly—they don't move at all.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.7. Pro: [Blasphemy laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law) have been overturned slowly over time and some still exist. This runs counter to the secular ideal of free speech and is slowly being stripped away in the western world.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.8. Pro: Religion still to this day condemns the morality of the LGBT community, a practice modern western society condemns as bigotry.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.8.1. Pro: Religion can be used as a protective barrier to further discriminatory, or harmful views that would otherwise be seen as violations of rights. For example, refusing to provide services for LGBT+ individuals on the basis of exercising religious freedom.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2. Pro: The moral codes often found in religious texts have been the cause of many social injustices including the persecution of homosexuals, people of colour and women.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: To give some idea of the scope of this issue, including persecution of those perceived as atheists: The percentage of us who are white male heterosexual Christians \(using this group not as definitive, but only to get us in the right ballpark\) is very low, so the vast majority of us are potential targets.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Religion often condemns [homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_religion).
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3. Pro: Religion has tried to control women's bodies by banning abortion, birth control and contraception.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1. Con: Opposing abortion is a testament to the preservation of life. Abortion can be viewed as killing potential life.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1. Con: The preservation of life leads to overpopulation, which leads to famine, spreading of diseases, and many other causes of death. So saving some lives indirectly kills much more lives. [Overpopulation effects.](http://www.everythingconnects.org/overpopulation-effects.html)
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con: The preservation of life has a [marginal effect](https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/causes-effects-solutions-of-overpopulation.php) on population growth. Other factors to take into consideration are: the decrease in mortality rates, the overcoming of poverty, advancements in fertility treatments, immigration and the lack of family planning.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Religiosity has [decreased](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/do-countries-lose-religion-as-they-gain-wealth-1.1310451) internationally, especially in developed countries, and many believers do not follow every religious teaching, yet if most of the world’s population did, overpopulation could be a bigger problem.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [Roman Catholic Church](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/contraception_1.shtml) refuses artificial methods of contraception; many [Hindus](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/contraception.shtml) are unlikely to use contraception; in [Orthodox Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_contraception), birth control is not acceptable or only to use in limited circumstances and although [Islam](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/contraception.shtml) allows contraception, more conservative leaders campaign against it.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Opposing birth control and contraception can be viewed as advocating against promiscuity.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Regardless of how one views it the consequences are real and can be shown.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: When contraception is prohibited even between married spouses, promiscuity is not the key element in its prohibition.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Religion has made promiscuity a bad thing, because if women had multiple partners the filiation link couldn't be established. By forcing monogamy \(at least for women \) on humanity , religion portrayed "promiscuity" as a bad thing. But one could see it as a very natural thing, to respond to one's desires.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: Opposing birth control also increases venereal disease.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See discussion #9226: Global overpopulation is a myth.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.2.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.2. Pro: Killing potential life is immoral
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3. Con: Control does not imply harm.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1. Con: Forcing women to continue their pregnancy and give birth may be harmful for the woman. Also, having to raise an unplanned child in a difficult economical or social environment can be a source of pain, such as starvation.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.1. Con: This is to prevent the greater harm of a death of a child. Religious view abortion as killing a human being with a soul and abhorrent in the same way most people would feel about killing an infant.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: The murder of children is wrong
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.1.2. Con: While it is true that religious people view abortion as killing a human being it is not true that a fetus is equivalent to a child.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.1.3. Con: The Catholic Church cares much more about the new adept-to-be rather than the wellness of women.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.2. Pro: -> See discussion #5637: Women should have the right to choose abortion.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.3. Pro: Fetuses do not have a conscious mind capable of experiencing pain and suffering. Pain reception only develops well into the [third trimester](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-does-consciousness-arise/) of pregnancy.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.4. Pro: As the fetus is a biological extension of the mother, it is up to her do with it what she sees fit.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.5. Con: Not all religious people view abortion as wrong.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.5.1. Con: In a lot of cases, even if individual believers do not think abortion is wrong, their religious teachings say otherwise.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: The [Roman Catholic Church](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/abortion_1.shtml#h2) considers an abortion "a grave moral wrong"; in [Sikhism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml) abortion if forbiden; [Hinduism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml) is opposed to it, except where it is necessary to save the mother; [Islam](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml) regards abortion as wrong and forbidden though with vital exceptions and [Judaism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/abortion_1.shtml) only permits it for serious reasons.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.5.2. Pro: Some [Catholics](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/abortion_1.shtml#h2) disagree with the Vatican about abortion and the Church has expressed the right and  responsibility of each believer "to follow his or her own conscience on moral matters, even when it conflicts with Church teaching".
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.1.6. Con: Many religious people feel that while abortion is wrong, it goes against the tenets of that religion to force that belief on others.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.2. Con: "Forced conversions" implies harm would befall the converted if they would not convert. Therefore, this conversion is harmful to the well-being of the converted.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.3. Pro: Control is not necessarily harming people. [Leadership and followship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_leadership_theory) can be beneficial to both parties. Power is sometimes viewed as only tyrannical control over the populations, but we often forget the benevolent and caring side of organized social structures.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.3.1. Pro: Traditionally, a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy) is a way for the followers to elect the leaders. People choose and respect the most competent people that they can trust to rule over them and represent their views on large scale issues.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.3.1.1. Con: Democracy is a very inefficient type of government structure. It is maintained as a social luxury, not for its merit.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.3.2. Con: Even if control was beneficial for a person, it would still be unjustified. Each person should have the right to decide how they will live their life, and noone should be able to make that decision for them. To decide otherwise is the beginning of tyranny.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.3.2.1. Con: People can value security over freedom and therefore feel happier when they don't have to choose everything themselves. Excessive choice is tyranny to some.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.4. Con: -> See 1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.3.2.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5. Pro: Religious social control can be and most often is consensually chosen by the believers themselves, particularly among converts.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.1. Con: If the religion has control over public policy and uses it to exert social control, then non-believers will also be forced to adhere nonconsensually to the control created. [Pew Article on views on abortion](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/22/american-religious-groups-vary-widely-in-their-views-of-abortion/)[Views on homosexuality](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/views-about-homosexuality/)
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.2. Con: Religious control uses emotion and faith which ignore reason. This makes the religion itself and the individuals less able to rationally evaluate social impacts or structures. A tipping point emerges when a religion cannot assess appropriate impacts within a larger group and are outcast as cult.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.2.1. Pro: The problem is more profound when the religion wields too much influence for it to be outcast.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.3. Con: Being born and indoctrinated into a faith is not voluntary. Moreover several religions place severe consequences on those who leave.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.3.1. Pro: If you leave Islam in certain countries you will die. If you leave Jehova's witnesses you will never speak to your family again. Same with the Amish. But more importantly you did not choose to have the religion forced on you as a child and it may be so deep in your brain that you could never escape.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.3.2. Pro: [Religious Trauma Syndrome \(RTS\)](http://www.babcp.com/Review/RTS-Trauma-from-Leaving-Religion.aspx) “is a function of both the chronic abuses of harmful religion and the impact of severing one’s connection with one’s faith” and can be compared to a combination of PTSD and Complex PTSD.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.3.3. Pro: Religions are routinely introduced to children who are too young to make an informed choice.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.3.3.1. Con: Children are capable of choice, but the degree to which they can make an informed and/or rational decision will vary from not at all, through not enough, to a minority who are as capable of making a decision as an adult.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.3.3.2. Pro: [Circumcision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision#Cultures_and_religions) is performed by Jews on the eighth day of life.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.3.3.3. Pro: The [First Communion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Communion) is normally received around the ages of 7 to 10  after a period or [cathequesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechesis) \(education\). And [Confirmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation#cite_note-28), the time when the believer really gives consent, also happens when children are young or in their mid-teens.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.3.3.4. Pro: Catholic parents [baptise](http://www.annunciationevv.org/Guidelines-for-Baptism) their children when they are babies and thus introduce them into the Catholic faith when they cannot consent.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.3.4. Pro: Hasidic Jews are [indoctrinated](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/21/ex-hasidim-life-stories_n_7343084.html) from a young age, often poorly educated \(with lack of English skills\) and pressured to have and provide for big families at really young ages. Those who try to live [secularly](http://www.nycreligion.info/leaving-ultraorthodox-judaism/) are often completely [rejected](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/magazine/the-high-price-of-leaving-ultra-orthodox-life.html) and, in many cases, their religious communities fight to keep custody of their [children](https://www.refinery29.com/2017/10/177040/netflix-one-of-us-orthodox-jewish-women-abuse-etty?bucketed=true).
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.5.4. Con: Through history, most often than not religion social control is imposed. Nowadays it is imposed by social stigma in some countries.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.6. Pro: The creation of standardized structures of morality keeps society predictable and manageable by those who live within them.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.6.1. Con: Religion is not required to create these standardised structures. Morality can successfully be defined by secular methods as well.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.6.2. Con: Creating one standardized structure of morality is near impossible even within one religion, much less in a way that creates predictability about how you should live. Evidence for this is differing opinions on any number of moral issues between different sects of Christianity, Islam or Judaism. If you live in society where multiple sects or multiple religions coexist whose standard prevails?
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.7. Con: Control implies a reduction in freedom. Individual freedom should not be impinged upon except to protect others.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.7.1. Con: Limiting individual freedom is necessary for group activities. The limitations of freedom a parent places on a child are for that child's own good, and similarly it does not follow that the controls exerted by religious adherence are necessarily bad for the individual.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.7.1.1. Con: A gilded cage is still a cage.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.8. Pro: Social control is not a minus in environments lacking other forms of control.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.9. Pro: The state is a form of social control too. Control is necessary to safeguard the rules that keep society safe and working and to protect the values we hold important. Without control, society would not exist.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.3.10. Pro: Control is needed for a society to advance.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.4. Pro: This regulation made overpopulation worse. [Overpopulation](http://churchandstate.org.uk/2015/12/how-religion-is-making-overpopulation-worse/) is the main cause of many major problems around the world.

1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.6. Pro: The [Roman Catholic Church](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/christianethics/abortion_1.shtml#h2) considers an abortion "a grave moral wrong"; in [Sikhism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml) abortion if forbiden; [Hinduism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml) is opposed to it, except where it is necessary to save the mother; [Islam](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml) regards abortion as wrong and forbidden though with vital exceptions and [Judaism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/abortion_1.shtml) only permits it for serious reasons.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.3.6.1.

1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.4. Pro: Many religions instill views of shame and sin regarding sexual relationships.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.4.1. Pro: Some religions do not approve pre-marital sex.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.4.1.1. Pro: [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_sexuality#Judaism) rejects premarital sex and views it as a sin.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.4.1.2. Pro: [Traditional Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_sexuality#Judaism) prohibits sexual relations outside of heterosexual marriages.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.4.1.3. Pro: [The Catholic Church](https://www.catholic.com/tract/birth-control) believes that artificial contraception is sinful and immoral, and that sex should be reserved to marriage.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: [Monty Python make the case for contraception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUspLVStPbk)
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.4.2. Pro: Anti-sex [views](http://metro.co.uk/2017/04/21/its-sexual-happiness-day-so-lets-talk-about-sex-guilt-6588843/) can have deep and [harmful psychological](https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/love-sex/77129141/Religious-or-cultural-beliefs-making-you-feel-guilty-about-sex) effects.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.4.3. Pro: Religious views regarding sex rely on harmful stereotypes that often place women's virginity and purity as the measure of a woman's worth.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.4.3.1. Pro: Gendered expectations around virginity often mean that women view virginity loss as giving something away and are encouraged to protect their virginity, while men losing their virginity is viewed as a way to gain status and experience.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.4.3.1.1. Pro: Traditional sexual scripts have resulted in women largely viewing virginity as a gift and something that they therefore have to be careful about giving away, while men see virginity as a stigma and think of its loss as a relief [\(Humphreys, p. 672\)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00224499.2012.677868?needAccess=true).
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.4.3.1.2. Pro: In the US, there has been a spread of [virginity balls](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/purity-balls-girls-in-the-us-making-virginity-pledges-as-fathers-vow-to-protect-purity-10271933.html) in Christian communities, where young women attend a ball with their fathers and pledge to abstain from sex until marriage. This often involves the fathers vowing to protect their daughter's purity and therefore equates virginity with purity for women.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5. Pro: Several religious denominations have often supported gender inequality.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.1. Pro: Orthodox Judaism is not [egalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism#Judaism) and opposes women being [rabbis](http://jbuff.com/c091607.htm).
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.2. Pro: Many [religions](http://www.bishopofmaidstone.org/male-headship-the-theological-basis/) support [complementarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism), a view that favors [male supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementarianism) as it defines men as the heads of the house and the Church.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.2.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(15\)00013-3/fulltext) points that domestic abuse is higher in regions across the globe "where norms related to male authority over female behavior are more common".
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.2.2. Con: This statement is only 'true' for the judeo-christian religions but are in no way defined as absolute truths \(and often debated\) in many other religions or sub-denominations. In non-judeo-christian religions it is also not implied that because 1 source of authority claims something, everybody else accepts this, which is quite different in catholic, judean or islamic 'hierarchies' or power structures.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.3. Pro: Although [Jainism](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/beliefs/women.shtml) is a religion of equality that seeks liberation and recognizes the rights of all living creatures \(including animals\), some sects consider liberation impossible for women without being reborn into men, and many denominations consider women harmful, impure or ‘second-class’ citizens .
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.3.1. Con: The words 'some' indicates that it might be a marginal strand of the religion thus it cannot count as an argument for religion itself to be biased \(in favor of males\) or patriarchal. Also there are also many [denominations](https://listverse.com/2013/10/04/10-forgotten-ancient-religions/) that adore women and consider them sacred so in the end, it could balance out.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4. Pro: Abrahamic ethics includes the [commandment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_covet) "You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor." This lumps people and wives particularly in as property. This is generally not seen as a kind thing.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.1. Con: You own yourself as you would property.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.1.1. Con: However, you do not own your spouse, which is what seems to be implied in the commandment.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.2. Con: This is meant as a lesson on jealousy, not as a commentary on the worth of women.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.2.1. Con: Yet it positions jelousy as coveting someone's possessions and those possessions include women, servants, a house and animals.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.3. Con: Religious based discrimination often just reflected the attitudes of the time, thus other forces, not religion, drove those views.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.3.1. Pro: The Book of Mormon, a text written in the [1830s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon), [included](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/mormons-race-max-perry-mueller/539994/) a number of contemporary racist themes.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.3.2. Pro: The Apostle Paul's [views on women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle_and_women) likely [reflected](https://www.crosswalk.com/church/pastors-or-leadership/ask-roger/does-the-apostle-paul-hate-women.html) the culture of the time.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.3.3. Con: Religion has a loud and powerful voice and claims to be divinely inspired and claims to define goodness, sin, and evil. If their morality simply reflects that of the time then it will have a tendency to popularize, and embed terrible trends and attitudes, thus hampering moral progress and holding society back.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.1.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.3.4. Con: If religious moral codes are deemed to transcend humans and be absolute in their own right \(because they emanate from a superior force\) then they should not be influenced by humanity's failures.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.3.5. Pro: The shocking thing would be if this weren't the case. Demagogy relies on instilling fear. That religion would not rely solely on creating a difference \(believers/infidels\) is hardly surprising.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.3.6. Con: By pointing to other differences that people already accept as bad they conflate belief/disbelief with those. That does not lessen the extent of their demagogy, it highlights it and shows that they were even worse, inventing a new thing to fear out of whole cloth.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.3.7. Con: Attitudes of the time are often the only overriding force to counter-act religious discrimination.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.3.8. Con: Attitudes of the time often change, but when adopted and codified into the doctrine of a religion they gain longevity in peoples minds for generations, eventually to the point where people no longer really understand what that attitude came from - they just adopt it - regardless of how toxic. The religion is then very stubborn/takes a long time on giving up on it, as to do so would be to admit fault
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.5. Con: Saying religions treat sexes differently \(based on biological differences\) does not imply their structure/institution is patriarchal. The main 'identification' of patriarchy is the structures of power and authority, not the \(absence of\) discrimination based on gender.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.6. Con: This lies on the idea that what is considered a wrong thing now was wrong in the past. To determine if something is wrong, its reasons and effects have to be analyzed according to the historical moment.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.7. Con: -> See 1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.5.4.3.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.2.8. Pro: Religion rely on books written long ago, which are representative of their times. Relying too much to the word, and not the meaning leads to bigotry and ignorance
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.2.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.4. Pro: The origins of the "[Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule#Ancient_Egypt)" \(the principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated\) which is often attributed to Christianity are actually far older.

1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.5. Con: Intolerance of other groups is a sociological phenomenon, and religion is merely the form or pretense it may take. For any example of something bad done in the name of religion, you can find equal evils done in the name of non-religious ideology or even naked tribalism.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.5.1. Con: The more that separates us the easier it is to point fingers.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.5.2. Con: Not every evil done in the name of religion would have been replaced by one done for a secular reason. It's plausible that none of the evils done in the name of religion would have been replaced. We don't all walk around looking for reasons to kill each other.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.6. Pro: Research found that children from religious families are [less kind and more punitive](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/religious-children-less-altruistic-secular-kids-study) than those from non-religious households.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3.3.6.1. Pro: Children from households identifying as Christianity or Muslim were [less altruistic](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/religious-children-less-altruistic-secular-kids-study) than children from non-religious households. Moreover, older children \(with a longer exposure to religion" showed "the greatest negative relations”.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: There are many passages within the main religious texts that exhort the adherents to kill all non-believers and that any who do not follow this "one true" religion are evil. Examples from the [Torah and Bible](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2015/01/22/yes-the-bible-does-say-to-kill-infidels/) and from the [Quran](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx).
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: The [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam#Quran) condemns apostates to death if they do not quickly repent and rejoin.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.4.2. Con: Historical texts are not written as a scientific paper, but most of them are written in a prose. A more right interpretation of these typical examples is a spiritual death. Nowadays, we attend to interpretate religious texts literally, however we find there true meaning between the lines; as is in life itself.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.4.2.1. Con: It can hardly be claimed that one interpretation is 'right'. Religious scholars have been arguing over the right interpretations for thousands of years with no obvious conclusion. Therefore it is just as viable to claim that literal death is the right interpretation rather than spiritual death.
For example, violent texts  [in the Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_in_the_Quran) and in [the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_violence).
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.4.2.2. Con: While some examples could be argued as meaning spiritual death, there are many others that extoll violence/murder be carried out on non-believers or those doing 'bad' deeds. It is hard to argue these are only meant to be taken as non-literal.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5. Con: Fanaticism, religious or secular, in contrast to mere fervent belief, is identical in its underlying extremism, but most major beliefs themselves do not inherently require intolerance of other beliefs. In the absence of specifically intolerant suppositions, found in fanaticism, belief isn't intolerant - people are.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5.1. Con: Many beliefs are themselves inherently intolerant and require neither fanaticism nor extremism to cause problems.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: The belief that [infidels and apostates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy#Contemporary_criminalization_of_apostasy) must die is the problem, there is not even need to take that to extremes to see the dangers.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: The belief that abortion is murder is inherently intolerant of the view that it is not since murder is outlawed in modern society, if one truly believes that abortion is murder they cannot allow others to commit the act just because they have differing views.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: The belief that abortion is murder makes you inherently intolerant of other people's choices, and justifies violence, as you believe that you are preventing substantial harm.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5.2. Con: Extremism is not a problem unless the fundamental beliefs are themselves flawed. A harmless belief taken to extremes is still harmless.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Extreme forms of love thy neighbor for example are not dangerous taken to any extreme conviction. It is other flawed beliefs that create the danger. Such as the belief that people who disagree should be made to agree or be killed.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5.1.1.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5.1.2.1.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.5.2.4. Pro: [Janism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism) for example, the more extreme you are the less dangerous you are to other people because the fundamental belief is non-violence. You might pose a danger to yourself if you cannot move or eat anything but you are no danger to others.
1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.6. Con: -> See 1.4.8.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.
1.4.8.1.2.1.2. Pro: Cecco d'Ascoli  was the first university scholar [burned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecco_d%27Ascoli) by the Inquisition.
1.4.8.1.2.1.3. Con: One incident, in one branch of Christianity, in a small period of time, is not representative for all religion.
1.4.8.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition#Definition_and_purpose), in different forms, lasted from the 12th century to the 19th century, in various territories and affecting a branch of Christianity that today [represents](https://www.livescience.com/27244-the-world-s-catholic-population-infographic.html) 1.1 billion people, 50% of Christians around the globe and 16% of the world's population.
1.4.8.1.2.1.4. Pro: Italian [Giordano Bruno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno) was tortured and killed by the church of Rome for having introduced the concept of infinity of the universe, the multiplicity of the worlds, and the motion of the Earth respect to the sun.
1.4.8.1.2.2. Pro: Heads of religions recognize only the parts of science which fit the description of the world they already give to the masses. All other science is called "sacrilege" and "untrue" and the proponents are persecuted. That narrows fields of scientific research and slows down the spread of new discoveries. Examples: [Book burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning#Christian_burnings), [Galileo Galilei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei), [Charles Darwin](http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/22078983).
1.4.8.1.2.2.1. Pro: With religions often claiming things contrary to science, it can not only encourage irrational thought, but encourage to the point of normalizing anti-science attitudes such as climate change denial.
1.4.8.1.2.2.2. Pro: For example, many Christians [believe](https://www.livescience.com/46123-many-americans-creationists.html) the world is 10,000 years old.
1.4.8.1.2.3. Pro: The Catholic Church has [disputed the theory evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_and_the_Catholic_Church).
1.4.8.1.2.4. Pro: Due to religious push back [stem cell research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_laws_and_policy_in_the_United_States) was restricted and in part banned.
1.4.9. Pro: Religious beliefs are founded on holy books that were written so long ago that many of their teachings are unacceptable in contemporary society.
1.4.10. Con: Religion is a part of human progress.
1.4.11. Con: The very idea of progress is influenced by religion, such as Christianity, which believes that history as space where things happen and develops to an end \(final judgment and paradise\), unlike other ancient worldviews that saw history as cyclical.
1.4.12. Con: Religion has made great contributions to humanity.
1.4.12.1. Pro: Religion was instrumental in developing and providing charity and the first forms of welfare.
1.4.12.1.1. Pro: The Catholic Church contributed greatly to the construction of social assistance and aid as far back as [370.](https://tomperna.org/2014/01/02/saint-basil-the-great-father-of-eastern-monasticism/)
1.4.12.1.2. Pro: Some religions provide a method, reason and means to act charitable to other human beings. The Catholic Church for example runs over [25% of healthcare facilities worldwide](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/catholic_hospitals_represent_26_percent_of_worlds_health_facilities_reports_pontifical_council).
1.4.12.1.3. Pro: Hospitals were founded, financed, and staffed by religions. An old [French term](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_hospitals) for hospital is hôtel-Dieu, "hostel of God."
1.4.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.4.12.3. Pro: Christianity leaves in its wake a roost of social, cultural, educational, scientific, and economic accomplishments as evident in art, music, literature, the building and maintaining of schools and hospitals, a record practical atheism cannot begin to compete with.
1.4.12.3.1. Pro: Abstract, Archetypal, Symbolic and Allegorical thought lie at the roots of both religion and creative endeavor.
1.4.12.3.2. Con: All of which, followed the 500 years of the "Dark Ages". For 500 years, science was held back by religion. \([Tim O'Neill on The NonSequitur Podcast Ep17: History for Atheist](http://www.nonseqshow.com/17) \)
1.4.12.3.3. Con: Christianity has also left in its wake war, destruction, bigotry, and, in some cases, invasive imperialism or colonialism.
1.4.12.3.3.1. Con: Religion codifies and retroactively justifies these underlying evolved tendencies in humans but does not create them. Correlation not causation.
1.4.12.3.3.2. Con: It is an injustice to Christianity to apply to it the results of political dominance stemming from human greed.
1.4.12.3.4. Con: The Church persecuted, killed, burned any and all opponents to its view. A record practical atheism doesn't even want to compete with.
1.4.12.3.4.1. Con: The Catholic Church was relatively tolerant compared to other religions and political movements.
1.4.12.3.4.1.1. Pro: Atheist states cannot claim any prizes other than ones for [maliciousness](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005143), [brutality](http://worldwithoutgenocide.org/genocides-and-conflicts/cambodian-genocide)and [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor)on this particular branch of argument. One might go as far to say that a Godless state is [capable of travesty](http://capable of travesty) without mercy.
1.4.12.3.4.1.2. Con: This is a what-about-ism. Being relatively tolerant does not excuse, negate, or justify one's still intolerant actions.
1.4.12.3.5. Con: Christianity forcefully imposed its dominion over all aspect of human conditions \(social, cultural, educational, scientific and economic\).
1.4.12.4. Pro: Religion has contributed towards science.
1.4.12.4.1. Pro: There have been many advances in disciplines such as astronomy, physics, mathematics and ethics that are directly tied to a [religious education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages#Intellectual_life).
1.4.12.4.2. Con: Science endured and flourished in spite of religion not because of it.
1.4.12.4.2.1. Con: Some of the larger Athiest states have [ridiculous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism) and [unethical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mengele#Human_experimentation) research avenues due to politics and ego. The Church does not have a monopoly on discouraging genuine science.
1.4.12.4.2.1.1. Con: No particular religion does, but Religion itself, yes.
1.4.12.4.2.2. Con: The list of Catholic priests and and Catholic lay scientists is quite [extensive](https://epicpew.com/11-amazing-catholic-scientists-you-should-know/). In the chaos that followed the fall of the Roman Empire and the great population alterations, the stability the Catholic Church provided undoubtedly helped science through the dark ages.
1.4.12.5. Pro: Religion has been instrumental in the promotion and creation of art.
1.4.12.5.1. Pro: Religion has provided an incredible amount of [inspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Christian_iconography) for very talented artists in history.
1.4.13. Pro: Major religions have [destroyed](https://raseef22.com/en/culture/2017/06/01/book-burning-islamic-history/) invaluable knowledge records \([book burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning#Christian_burnings), [book bans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_censorship), etc\) many times since mankind created writing.
1.4.13.1. Con: Religious-banning regimes like the [USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union#Religion), [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nazi_Germany) or [Khmer Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge), among others, also [destroyed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_Soviet_Union#Destruction_of_printed_matter) [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_book_burnings).
1.4.13.2. Con: Book burning is a way to control ideas and knowledge. A ban on a rich historical area of human thought and expression, while outdated by many measures, is likewise an effort to control ideas and knowledge. To focus on the destruction of "knowledge records" is to conflate goals and tactics.
1.4.13.2.1. Con: A ban on religion would not destroy knowledge it would ban belief and expression but that would not cause humans to lose any concrete knowledge. The knowledge of the history and belief systems would remain intact.
1.4.13.2.1.1. Con: A society that is willing to take the extreme tactic of banning a system of thought is certainly capable of destroying knowledge. A ban of this type is fascist and anti-democracy as well.
1.4.13.2.1.1.1. Con: In a democratic state, people can agree that their state may promote secular values and be secular. In the same manner, a state could vote to implement a ban on organized religion, and that would be democratic.
1.4.13.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The point at which the people of a democratic state might vote to have a broad ban on religion is the point at which one of two things are true: 1. Religion, in general, is no longer widespread and influential in public life or policy, thus calling into question whether a ban is needed. 2. If religion still has influence then such a ban would not pass a majority vote. A non-specific ban is quite unlikely to occur in a democratic state. This could happen in a totalitarian state, however. And has.
1.4.13.3. Con: The actions of a few religions canot be generalised to be the actions of all religions.
1.4.13.3.1. Pro: This is especially true because the [definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/religion) of religion does not explicitly state that they take part in such behaviour, and so theoretically a religion can exist which does not behave in such a way.
1.4.13.3.1.1. Con: While theoretically religions can exist that do not engage in this behavior, the issue is that historically, two of the biggest’ world religions have indeed participated in these actions.
1.4.13.3.2. Con: When these [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations) represent 2.4 and 1.8 billion of believers and a combined 57% of the world’s religious population, they cannot be characterized as “a few religions” since they are the most impactful and the most spread around the globe.
1.4.13.4. Con: Religions have protected knowledge from destructive political movements such as the Pol Pot and Nazi regimes.
1.4.13.4.1. Con: This is like excusing the Nazi genocide of the jews by saying they did not subject black people to the same treatment so were "relatively" less racist...
1.5. Con: A ban on religion may bring harmful consequences.
1.5.1. Pro: Any attempt to ban religion would amplify the precise problems it seeks to minimize or eliminate and create [backlash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_\(sociology\)).
1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.2.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Even if you believe something is wrong, unless it directly affects others it should never be banned, because people always double down when forced against their believes. Banning religion would also strongly reinforce the idea to terrorist that they are doing the correct thing, because they would actually be prosecuted.
1.5.1.3. Pro: A "ban on religion" is simply a new and clearly tyrannical religion, with all the problems of any religion regarding adherence, punishment of apostates, etc.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: A religious ban on religions is suicidal logic. Religions are simply our highest values, and a "ban on religion" is simply a truth claim of a higher value.  Those who ban would have to answer every question religion answers.  Sexual morals, for example.  What would those be if "religions" were banned?  They people who would ban have an answer, I am sure.
1.5.2. Pro: Many religious groups engage in charity and charitable work in their local communities and beyond.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Historically, the Christian Church has been the greatest provider of not-for-profit social good and responsible for the building of countless schools, hospitals, and other vital social institutions.
1.5.3. Pro: Banning religion would in itself cause more conflict than has ever been seen in all of history.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Implementing a global ban on religion would require the introduction of a "world government" with the power to impose laws on every country in the world. Creating such a world government would likely trigger the bloodiest war in the history of mankind.
1.5.3.2. Pro: A ban on religion feeds the persecution complex. Doing so may stop outward religious expression but will strengthen internal belief and conviction which while not harmful is contrary to the point of banning religion.
1.5.3.3. Pro: Though they are demonstrably untrue and largely harmful to societies, people should be allowed to believe what they wish to because enacting thought crime policies would be even more harmful.
1.5.3.3.1. Pro: A ban might enhance a religious groups sense of being alianated, therefore acknowledging it, fortifying their irrational opinions.
1.5.3.4. Pro: This would simply be a tool of the powerful to eliminate viewpoints they do not like. They would simply label any viewpoint they dislike as "religious", and any viewpoint they like as non-religious. All viewpoints, including religious ones should only face the restriction of social acceptance, not the restrictions of top-down bans.
1.5.4. Pro: Historical attempts at banning religion have proved disastrous.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Historically, suppression of religion is accompanied by genocide. Recent efforts to legally \(or forcefully\) change or abolish religions in Russia, China, Germany, Cambodia - or even among the indigenous populations of America - have proved in that in order to eliminate a religion, the religious must first be eliminated.
1.5.4.2. Pro: The death of millions under systems of atheistic communism is harmful consequence of banning religion
1.5.5. Pro: Religion in its simplest form could be an idea. Banning religions may create a huge vacuum in a space that was filled up for centuries with faith and matter of assurance for mankind. Taking it away altogether might create a pandemonium to fill that space that may exist once ideologies become non-existent.
1.5.6. Pro: If a God exists, surely banning its worship would not go unpunished.
1.5.6.1. Pro: -> See discussion #2629: [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism) exists.
1.5.6.2. Pro: -> See discussion #3491: The God of classical monotheism \(omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent mind\) exists.
1.5.6.3. Con: -> See discussion #1960: Because of the existence of evil, there cannot be a monotheistic God \(as traditionally conceived\).
1.6. Con: It is impossible and therefore useless to try.
1.6.1. Pro: People will believe secretly in a religion
1.6.1.1. Pro: It is impossible to control the beliefs that a person holds, even if they are not allowed to share those beliefs or practice the traditions that accompany them.
1.6.2. Pro: Religion cannot be removed from the world without also removing a major piece of almost every culture's traditions, values, and history.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Many cultural traditions are laden with religious history, background, and origins.
1.6.2.1.1. Con: There is an extensive list of things in history that should not be glorified.
1.6.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Senicide](https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/767368) and [Human Sacrifice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice#Pre-Columbian_Americas) among the North American native religions would be a good example of this.
1.6.2.1.1.2. Con: We can strike the middle ground- we don't have to glorify everything, but neither need we eliminate these important parts of cultures.
1.6.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: For example, we should not glorify what the Japanese did in WWII, but we don't need to eliminate Shinto shrines or forbid people from stopping and praying at them.
1.6.2.2. Con: Religions have already come and go, the cult of [Râ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_religion), [Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion), [Odin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_mythology) all disappeared in practice, they live on in history books and iconic cultural references. They did not "disappear" but their role changed.
1.6.3. Pro: A ban would be impractical and counterproductive, best would be to create an environment where religions would naturally disappear because their uselessness would be made manifest.
1.6.4. Pro: It is impossible, believing in something nourishes the human mind.
1.6.5. Pro: We are so intertwined with religion that it would be impossible to un-link our current culture. If we were to ban religions we would still keep the impact they have had on us but lose the context and prevent them from evolving.  As long as people feel strongly about ideas we will always have the negatives from religions anyway.
1.6.6. Pro: Only an estimated of [1.1 Billion individuals](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/10/06/the_odd_body_religion/) identify as nonreligious.
1.6.7. Pro: Banning religion has failed throughout history because belief is more powerful than oppression.
1.6.7.1. Pro: There is a long history of governments and monarchies attempting to ban particular religions or denominations, only for believers in those faiths to continue to practice in secret.
1.6.8. Pro: Religion is one of the primary proponents to a worldview. It is utterly impossible to ban all religions, as you would have to erase everyone's thought process, based on their worldview.
1.6.8.1. Con: One may ban organisational activities that are connected to religion.
1.6.9. Pro: Religion is a primal human need. It is a consequence of the development in Homo sapiens of an abnormally large prefrontal cortex. This has made self consciousness possible and once that exists, the need for a belief in the continuance of existence beyond this earthly sphere is inevitable.[Neuropsychotherapist - The prefrontal Cortex](https://www.neuropsychotherapist.com/prefrontal-cortex/)
1.6.10. Pro: The line distinguishing what is and is not an organized religion is can be blurry and difficult to establish.
1.6.10.1. Pro: Some religions just offer spiritual guidance but present huge differences with other organized faiths. It would be very difficult to draw a line when implementing a ban.
1.6.10.1.1. Pro: There is no clear definition of "religion" - and even "inside" a religion there can be different orientations. E.g. [Buddishm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Schools_and_traditions) can be lived as very personal path to enlightment \(Zen for example\) or with pure emphasis on ritual worship.
1.6.10.1.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #16677: Buddhism is not a religion.
1.6.10.1.2. Pro: For example, many self-described Buddhists claim that Buddhism is not a religion, but a philosophical orientation, like stoicism. Meanwhile, while certainly a single, organized institution, Unitarian Universalism allows for such diverse beliefs that some would consider it a stretch to call it a religion.
1.6.10.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.1.1.
1.6.11. Con: The likelyhood of impossibility does not necessarily mean it is useless to try. Anything worth having or gaining is worth trying for, even if you're unsuccessful. Better to try than do nothing.
1.6.12. Pro: Religion as a set of beliefs could never be banned because people will still believe something and will end up inventing new systems of beliefs, though they may not call them religion
1.6.13. Pro: Many deeply religious people would simply ignore a ban and continue to practice regardless of the legal consequences.
1.7. Con: There are better solutions than completely baning all religions.
1.7.1. Pro: Fundamentalists, extreme or even violent actors and values within religion are the problem, not religion. Regulations could be in place to ban those.
1.7.1.1. Pro: It is literalist, sometimes violent strains of religious fundamentalism that are more closely correlated with the problems a ban wouls seek to solve. To place a ban on all religion is to ascribe to the whole what is actually a disease of specific parts.
1.7.2. Pro: Supporting secularism, as opposed to banning religion, is likely to be much more effective.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Implement a rewards system with which to entice secular rational persons to reproduce. The birth rates are falling in secular humanist countries.
1.7.2.2. Con: Doing so on a governmental level shows a partisan preference for a particular worldview. This would be the inverse of Middle Age religious dogma that saw the persecution for other belief structures. Even if law only encourages secularism the real-world ramifications would be a net negative for those not of that worldview and thus would equate to preferential treatment based on thought
1.7.2.3. Pro: Banning religion is a ham-fisted approach to the problem. The best way to fight the demagoguery of organized religion is to simply illustrate a better way to live, to prove kindness, generosity and universal love are altruistic good, and not the discovery or monopoly of religion. Then finally people will see for themselves we have outgrown it once and for all.
1.7.2.4. Pro: Offering more education in science would also be effective, as most of the religious claims about the world can be contradicted with science.
1.7.3. Pro: Mandating education about where religion comes from and about the evidence for and against its beliefs as well as teaching an understanding of Bayesian analysis of prior probabilities and evidence would be impartial and would make people leave religion because they thought it through rather than leaving because they must.
1.7.4. Pro: A ban is not necessary since religion may just die out in the future.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Religion is a way to think about the unknown and thus less necessary the more we know.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: Religion is a shorthand mode of thinking about ways in which to act within a given set of facts. Religion makes intuitive claims about "ought" while positing allegorical \[ often ridiculous and unfounded \] claims about what "is".
1.7.4.2. Con: Humans have an [innate need](https://hbr.org/1998/07/how-hardwired-is-human-behavior) to organize around a common Phenomenon/Belief. Sports, for example, are almost a religion in many places and give fans a sense of belonging.
1.7.4.2.1. Pro: This supports the notion that religion is evolving and may soon die out as it is subsumed into ever more sophisticated versions of itself that more closely reflect an advanced information and science based society. A religion of the intellect may soon replace supernatural claims.
1.7.4.3. Pro: [The number of people claiming "none" on polls asking about religion are on the rise.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/14/the-factors-driving-the-growth-of-religious-nones-in-the-u-s/) Religion's demise is just a waiting game. No ban required.
1.7.4.4. Pro: There are now [more atheists and agnostics](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/04/half-uk-population-has-no-religion-british-social-attitudes-survey) in the UK than there are Christians, particularly among young people, nearly 3/4 of whom are not religious.
1.7.5. Pro: Attrocities carried out in the name of the religion are the issue at hand. Taking away control from the those people would be a solution. IE not buying oil from saudi arabia so it has funds to finance terrorism[medium.com](https://medium.com/s/just-world-order/how-the-united-states-is-helping-saudi-arabia-destabilize-the-middle-east-b408863289b3)
1.7.6. Pro: Suppression of free will is never successful. Rather than a ban, maybe just active promotion of a set of human morals that assures fair treatment across all classes would be better.
1.7.7. Pro: Banning anything, is not a good decision. Even if the thing itself is detrimental or useless.
1.7.7.1. Con: By that logic, drugs, weapons, slavery or human/animal torture could not be banned either. Some things that a given society deems as very detrimental can and are indeed banned or limited.
1.7.8. Con: Other organisations that peddle false or un-provable claims for financial or social gain have been made illegal.
1.7.8.1. Pro: Religious people are allowed to [proclaim harmful nonsense without meaningful punishment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/did-lesbians-cause-hurricanes-irma-and-harvey-god-knows/2017/09/08/638efbca-94bf-11e7-89fa-bb822a46da5b_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.a0a78f8e6431) yet we punish people like Gwyneth Paltrow for instance:[Goop Agrees to Pay $145,000 for ‘Unsubstantiated’ Claims About Vaginal Eggs](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/business/goop-vaginal-egg-settlement.html)
1.7.9. Con: As scientific research papers are discussed in the community of researchers and specialists we can create the Platform for all religions and confessions where clerical, scientific and philosophic specialists can debate differences, common principles, sources and practices in order to find out singularity&similarity of all religious ideas and roots as they come from the Only One Source. On the base of research and discussion Ecumenism can be reborned, and Re-Ligion established.
1.7.10. Pro: What needs to be eliminated is hatred and intolerance between people of different religions, and not religion itself.
1.7.11. Pro: If ones wishes to diminish religion's power, the best solution is to simply remove their tax favored status and their property tax exemption.
1.7.11.1. Pro: -> See discussion #14255: Churches should lose their automatic tax-exempt status.
1.8. Pro: Religion is a form of control.
1.8.1. Pro: We humans developed religions & rituals to quiet the 'bumps' in the night and to give a purpose to a seemingly unrelenting work or die life. As we became more communal, laws, punishments and customs were developed to control societies. Religions are mind governments and police individual thought. It's time for each individual to uncover the controls and rid them inside their own valuable life for themselves.
1.8.1.1. Con: This fails to actually distinguish the needs for religion from the modern needs for laws and efforts to control society. It also presumes that religion does not provide a means for an individual to become free of the things that control their lives, and thus misses the main point of spiritual and religious paths, which is freedom from control and baser desires.
1.8.2. Con: Control is a negatively charged synonym for mental model or framework.
1.8.3. Con: The question is whether or not we should go so far as to ban something -- or should we see about taming or pruning its ugliest branches instead.
1.8.4. Con: Removing control through a ban amounts to just more control. Forced emancipation is not emancipation. To relieve them of the control they must come to realize what it is themselves. The best we can do to help is to provide education at a young age when the religious begin indoctrination.
1.8.5. Con: Religion is as much a form of control as any club, sport group or racial affiliation. Religion in modern civilization isn't a barrel to your head. It's something you are usually born into and have the freedom to walk away from as you mature. As with all ideologies, you will inevitably acquire a healthy dose of good and bad information.
1.8.6. Con: Control in itself is not a bad thing.
1.8.6.1. Pro: Laws, for example, are a form of control.
1.8.7. Pro: belief in anything is personal, so does not need an organised structure to control what is believed. its main purpose, historically has been mass social control, without religion we are in control of our own beliefs.
1.9. Con: The right to profess a religion freely is fundamental.
1.9.1. Pro: While the reason for a proposed ban have not been stated, the primary reason against is simple: it is a [basic human right](http://www.equalityhumanrights.com).
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.3.
1.9.3. Pro: The right to free thought is even more fundamental than the right to free speech.
1.9.3.1. Con: There is no "[Free thought](https://youtu.be/pCofmZlC72g)"
1.9.4. Pro: Banning religion is tantamount to thought crime, which is unethical.
1.9.5. Con: Yes, as long as it doesn't affect other citizen's liberties and fundamental rights
1.9.5.1. Pro: French when they defined their [Declaration of human and civic rights of 26th of August 1789](https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/sites/default/files/as/root/bank_mm/anglais/cst2.pdf) for the new republic defined a framework that would also emancipate them from catholic church's hold. See article 4 and 10
1.9.6. Pro: Freedom of religion is a human right protected by the [UN](http://www.claiminghumanrights.org/thought_religion_definition.html) and legislated and [protected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_by_country) by every liberal [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion#Europe) in the world.
1.9.6.1. Pro: [Countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_by_country) that [ban](https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2014/01/worst-countries-religious-freedom/) religion, do not allow freedom of religion or promote a specific state religion are generally [dictatorships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Saudi_Arabia) or absolute monarchies.
1.9.7. Pro: This is no different than the church "banning" the heliocentric view of the solar system. Bans on systems of thought are fascist at their core.
1.9.7.1. Pro: A free society supports diverse systems of thought -- even wildly divergent systems, provided they do not negatively impact democracy, individual rights ...etc. A more selective approach is what's needed here.
1.9.7.1.1. Pro: Banning Creationism in textbooks -- banning the teaching in Biology classes are ways to selectively reduce the encroachment of religious beliefs in society. A step further in classrooms might outline how creationism does a bad job explaining observed natural phenomena. Expose instead of ban. Understanding is more powerful than policy.
1.9.7.2. Pro: History does not favor this approach. Religious citizens of the USSR worshiped in the woods and hid their holy books. [They suffered imprisonment, persecution ...etc.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Christians_in_the_Soviet_Union#Anti-religious_campaign_1928–1941)
1.9.8. Pro: Banning religion would be against freedom of speech
1.10. Pro: People will focus on important things
1.10.1. Con: They will focus on filling the gaps in their lives previously filled by religious practice.
1.10.2. Con: For many, religion imbues life with meaning and purpose \[ Ie., importance \]. In a world without meaning and purpose, nothing can be considered important.
1.10.2.1. Con: Without religion telling people what is important they may decide for themselves. They may for example decide that their loved ones are important or that their career is important or that helping other people is important. Without a religious mandate the choice is theirs.
1.10.3. Pro: People can accept injustice and unfairness because they believe that god will reward them at the end. Fighting for your own justice and being treated fairly seems to me like the most important thing a human being has to do in our modern societies.
1.10.3.1. Con: The belief of an afterlife and an absolute moral right and wrong has encouraged many religious people to focus on important things.
1.10.3.1.1. Pro: For example, christian people have ben instrumental in creating the US Constitution, ending slavery, giving women right to vote, creating hospitals, orphanages, standing up to voiceless peoples, and much more.
1.10.4. Pro: People would have more time and space for discovering secrets we don't know about yet. More people could get into science looking for any evidence of higher creation or finding out how the world works.
1.10.5. Con: Religion is not a major attention drain. Series, smartphones and alcohol may be worse.
1.11. Pro: Religion is made up and is fictional.
1.11.1. Con: Being made up or fictional does not imply that something should be banned by law.
1.11.1.1. Pro: Banning made up things would include banning of most forms of art, especially stories. Fictional stories encourage people to read which makes them smarter and many have morals to them. Taking this away would be detrimental to society.
1.11.2. Con: The belief that the metaphysical claims of religion are false is just as unproveable as the belief that they are true.
1.11.2.1. Con: Some religions have metaphysical claims that are logically fallacious or contradictory. Those can be proven to be wrong.
1.11.2.2. Con: This position is premised on the [burden of proof fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof).
1.11.2.2.1. Con: Burden of proof lies on the person making the claim, in this case it would lie with the person claiming that religion is fake, not the person talking about how it cannot be proven as that is common knowledge.
1.11.2.3. Con: Not all claims of religion are purely metaphysical, and not all the metaphysical claims have no bearing on the physical world. Any number of religious claims have been disproven to a degree that can only be refuted by speculative justifications and further disengagement from reality.
1.11.3. Con: Fiction is a social contract that admits of factual falsity with the promise of other types of truth embedded. Eg., spiritual truth, moral truth. Truth about how one should act. A template similar to a logical form \( Eg., modus ponens \) upon which other facts might be placed. Fiction should not be banned and neither should religion.
1.11.4. Pro: Most religions have evolved from older religions, where the founders have changed elements of that older religion, which they dislike, to make up their new religion.
1.11.4.1. Con: Religion is an attempt to discover the truth. New religions may be made in the same way that scientific theories are proposed, and they may grow or disappear depending on acceptance of these religious 'theories'. We know that in the end there is only one truth, and until it is known there is no reason to stop searching; we know that models in physics are imperfect and there are multiple ideas for how things work but this does not invalidate them all.
1.11.4.2. Con: To support banning all religions, it must apply to all religions, or risk banning a religion that is not made up.
1.11.4.2.1. Con: All religions are made up.
1.11.5. Con: Religion is ''made up'' or better said, it is a human invention that is now becoming obsolete, but so is the nation itself which is a political construct ''invented'' in the 19th century. Some human inventions regarding political thought that emphasize social control are necessities.
1.11.6. Con: Even if that is true, all religions fundamentally promote peace \(whether the people follow those teachings is up to them\). Even if one thinks think that the Bible, or Quran or Buddha are made up, the teaching still stand in today's society more than ever.
1.11.6.1. Pro: It would be like banning Harry Potter because it's fictional even though it has important lessons to take away from it.
1.11.6.2. Con: The Old Testament justifies wars with invaders of Judea while the Koran sanctions holy wars to drive out infidels who take residence in a Muslim homeland.
1.11.6.2.1. Pro: [God orders the Israelites to exterminate](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+7&version=NIV) all the existing tribes and peoples living in Israel.
1.11.6.2.1.1. Con: The Torah had orders to clear the promised land of Canaanites. And other wars and laws for Israel when it was an autonomous nation. After they returned from captivity, they had to abide by the laws of the ruling power. They still had the instruction to 'love your fellow as yourself.'
1.11.6.2.1.2. Con: Most scholars conclude that the biblical accounts of [extermination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herem_\(war_or_property\)) are exaggerated, fictional, or metaphorical.For instances, the Book of Joshua describes the extermination of the Canaanites, yet Joshua and Judges both suggest that the extermination [was not complete](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2494730/jewish/Torah-and-Genocide-FAQ.htm).
1.11.6.2.1.2.1. Con: [Modern historians think that the entire exodus story is entirely fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus#Historicity) but that is irrelevant to the fact that it is part of the cannon. Devout Jews truly believe that they were in Egypt and returned to Canaan where they were commanded by their god to massacre the existing populations of non-Jews.
1.11.6.2.1.3. Con: Although the biblical narrative commands the extermination of the of Canaanites, "mainstream Jewish traditions throughout history have treated these texts as [purely historical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_warfare) or highly conditioned, and in either case not relevant to contemporary life".
1.11.6.2.1.3.1. Con: Despite that mainstream view, "some minor strains of [radical Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_warfare)" have promoted "aggressive war" and they have justified it with biblical texts.
1.11.6.2.1.4. Pro: [God commanded the Jews to slaughter the Amalekites.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+17&version=NIV)
1.11.7. Pro: There are some things we can conclude about a hypothetical God, if evil exists we know no God is [simultaneously all powerful and all loving.](http://www.vexen.co.uk/religion/theodicy.html) Since most people believe in a religion where they pretend God is as such, we can actually conclude that more than the worlds population are in a religion where the deity [cannot exist.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations) Although since the two religions which make up over half the worlds population has a murderous God, we should already know the most commonly worshipped God isn't all loving.
1.12. Pro: Banning religions would help in stopping religiously motivated inhuman and unjust practices \(e.g. death penalty and inequality in inheritance in some religions\) which can’t be prevented as long as religions are allowed.
1.12.1. Con: Death Penalty is not exclusive of religious societies. It is/was used also by secular governments.
1.12.2. Pro: Getting rid of [FGM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation) would drastically improve the lives of many around the world.
1.12.3. Pro: If there were no religions there would be a lot less terrorism.
1.12.4. Con: These effects would not happen instantly after religion being banned.
1.12.4.1. Pro: Eventually is better than never.
1.12.5. Con: Banning religion itself would be an 'inhuman and unjust practice'.
1.12.5.1. Pro: A ban on religion amounts to an attack on human liberty and religious freedom. If we consider the resources required to enforce a ban and the intrusiveness of this effort into private life, such a law would indeed be 'inhuman and unjust', on a scale at least equal to, or possibly worse than the depredations inflicted in the name of religion.
1.13. Pro: There will be less wars and conflict.
1.13.1. Con: People will not suddenly live in harmony, selflessness, humility, and grace because religion is banned.
1.13.1.1. Pro: Wars are not generally fought over religions anymore; they are fought over material resources. People use religion as an excuse because they don't want to take responsibility for their own actions.
1.13.1.2. Pro: Atheism has no mechanism for the promotion of harmony, selflessness, humility, and grace
1.13.1.2.1. Con: Atheists can still utilize the mechanics of empathy, reasoning, and more to promote harmony, selflessness, humility, and grace without subscribing to religious doctrines.
1.13.1.2.1.1. Pro: Selflessness, humility, grace, empathy, mercy, harmony are all characteristics of pro social behaviour in all humans. To externalise the source of those things to scripture and divinity is to weaken ourselves
1.13.1.2.1.2. Con: Religions can provide an easier, more organized way of presenting and teaching these mechanics.
1.13.1.2.1.2.1. Con: However, religion can also present these values, while in a more organized way, in a manner that unermines them.
1.13.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: It is difficult to be emphatic with other, when one believe that non-believers deserve eternal damnation.
1.13.1.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: Harmony and empathy may be difficult to teach when one promotes one gender should be submissive to another or when some sexual oritnetations are described as sinful.
1.13.1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.13.1.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Religious sects and teachings vary, so a broad claim of religions teaching values in an undermining manner is disingenuous.
1.13.2. Con: Religions are rarely the cause of wars.
1.13.2.1. Pro: While religion is often blamed as the primary source of most historical conflicts, research shows that there are multiple factors in play, more often than not, secular and political.
1.13.2.1.1. Pro: Instances of violence for which religion has been blamed cannot be separated from just as likely secular causes of the same violence. As was outlined in William T Cavanaugh's 2009 book "[The Myth of Religious Violence](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195385045.001.0001/acprof-9780195385045-chapter-2)" published by Oxford University Press.
1.13.2.1.2. Pro: [Historians](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-alan-lurie/is-religion-the-cause-of-_b_1400766.html) Phillips and Axelrod document the history of recorded warfare, and from their list of 1,763 wars only 123 have been classified to involve a religious cause. Religion isn’t the problem.
1.13.2.1.2.1. Con: Conflict is unavoidable, yet while conflicts about land ownerships or civil rights have a tangible outcome \(being able to live in a place, the abolition of slavery, etc.\) religious conflicts are based on a preventable dispute about ideas that, even after violence, have no substantial consequences.
1.13.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Religious conflict has at times had immense ideological and sociological consequence. Christianity and Islam both completely upturned the societies they won over. The zoroastrian Mazdakites initiated what amounts to a socialist revolution 1300 years before Marx was born. Religious conflict is one of the major reasons North America was colonised as quickly as it was.
1.13.2.1.3. Con: While the primary source of historical conflicts might be political or economical, religion is often used to gather mass consent around particular political leaders, often moving the masses to commit atrocities.
1.13.2.1.4. Con: It might be simplistic to pretend to separate religion from political, economical or other secular interests.  The fact that there are many factors at play in historical conflicts does not exclude religion from being one of the factors contributing to war.  Religion is articulated with other economic, social and cultural factors in order to exacerbate feelings of group chauvinism that are moved against the perceived deviant other.
1.13.2.2. Pro: Secular causes have cause [several times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_war) as many war deaths throughout [history](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-alan-lurie/is-religion-the-cause-of-_b_1400766.html).
1.13.2.2.1. Pro: The Soviet Union, an officially anti-religious nation, functionally killed tens of millions of people due to abuse of power; this was fueled by an ideology unrelated to religious ideology. Any ideology can be harmful, not exclusively a religious one.
1.13.2.2.2. Pro: People have been led to do terrible things outside of religion. Some of the greatest atrocities in history had no religious motivation. For example: the [Great Leap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward) and the outbreak of [World War II](https://www.historyonthenet.com/world-war-two-causes/).
1.13.2.2.2.1. Con: The Catholic church preached as doctrine that the Jews were collectively responsible for [deicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_deicide). This belief fostered two millennia of antisemitism and was only [repudiated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_deicide#Repudiation) and removed as doctrine in 1962 during the second Vatican Council. This antisemitism was part of the environment that allowed Hitler's rise.
1.13.2.2.2.2. Pro: In modern times by far the greatest source of conflict has been totalitarian political ideologies, which include not just militant imperialism, Marxism, and fascism, but also totalitarian Islamism, which is no mere religion.  Neglecting the mass suffering & oppression, just the death toll of totalitarianism from war, famine, & genocide since the early 20th century is in the hundreds of millions. There is nothing comparable perpetrated by religious organizations outside of said totalitarianism.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1. Pro: The religions claimed to have waged atrocities were either theocracies or defacto government authorities. One might say it is governmental bodies that incite mass atrocity and not religion. For example,  [Logistics of the crusades](http://dcc.newberry.org/collections/the-crusades-motivations-administration-and-cultural-influence), [Classical and Mixed Sharia Systems](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Application_of_Islamic_law_by_country), [Catholic Missions](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Catholic_Church_in_Latin_America)
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con: One might say in those cases that religion seized political authority and used to it to incite mass atrocity. In such a view governmental bodies would simply be a tool religions can use to do terrible things.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Religion cultivates political power.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Legislative restrictions may be imposed upon citizens due to religious principles, regardless if those citizens share those values or not.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Without resorting to political order, a Religion cannot force its citizens to adopt a set or rules. It may only suggest a moral code by which to live.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In the past and even nowadays, religious authorities and religious groups have often pressured legislators to sanction laws according to their beliefs
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Everyone pressures their legislators to sanctions laws according to their opinions and beliefs, this is neither a bad thing nor unique to religion. It's simply how \(most\) western governments work.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: While lobbying in general is common in most places secularism and separation of [church and state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state) is also valued in many modern societies.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: In the USA churches can [lose their tax exemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Amendment) if they endorse political candidates because it is recognized that religion is not something that should be influencing government the same way as everything else.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: The way a political order forces citizens to follow rules is by threat of consequences. Religions have done the same thing with their own threats and consequences. Religions have used excommunication, inquisitions, pogroms, and burning at the steak to enforce their rules and values.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Personal freedoms are often restricted by laws such as Kashrut or Sharia.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Personal freedom may not be the highest value. For example, conservatives usually prioritize personal responsibility over freedom.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Religious laws are being created even nowadays, the most numerous of which are probably the [anti-LGBT ones in the US](https://www.aclu.org/other/legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country).
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Religion can be used as a protective barrier to further discriminatory, or harmful views that would otherwise be seen as violations of rights. For example, refusing to provide services for LGBT+ individuals on the basis of exercising religious freedom.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: Religion is  opposing many contemporary laws.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Legalization of some [Drugs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_drugs), legalization of [Gay marriage](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_and_religion), legalization of [Abortion](http://churchandstate.org.uk/2015/12/how-religion-is-making-overpopulation-worse/), are some examples of laws that have traditionally been or are currently contested by religious people.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: By claiming to have a direct connection to God and through a supporting morality, [monarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings) were able to convince their subjects to gladly do things against their own personal interest, but supporting the survival of the nation. This increased social density, which lead to economic and technological development.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Concepts, like the [Divine Right of Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings), were important in establishing state authority.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Organized religions have often sided with elites, legitimating or enhancing their power.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: In previous times monarchs derived the right to rule directly from the [will of God.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings)
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Protestant rulers often headed their own state churches.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Until [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Norway#State_and_church) the constitutional head of [the Church of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Norway) was the King of Norway.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Sweden funded the Church of Sweden, its own national church in 1477: royals and elected officials could only profess this faith. Although laws gradually allowed religious freedom, it was not until 1951 that nationals could leave the Church without having to be part of another congregation, and it was not until 2000 that the State and the Church were formally separated \([Jänterä-Jareborg, p. 672](https://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Sweden.1.pdf)\).
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Roman Catholic rulers had their legitimacy supported by the [Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_between_the_Catholic_Church_and_the_state#The_papacy_and_the_Divine_Right_of_Kings).
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.4. Pro: Over the course of history the papacy has held tremendous political power in various forms.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.4.1. Pro: The papacy was head of the [Papal States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States)
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.4.2. Pro: The Pope participated in many coronations in Europe throughout history.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: Religions have not developed in isolation, they have reflected cultural norms and enshrined them in a way that makes it harder to shift them. Their privilege, and the privileges they make into doctrines create and perpetuate inequality
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.6. Pro: The success of farming depends on the climate and size of land. At the point of saturation, if lands can not be conquered, then the minds can be conquered instead because it accumulates wealth and creates committed soldiers to defend a faith.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.7. Con: Not if the religion in question actively argues against the use of power. If that religion is used to cultivate political power anyway, the religion is subverted, not the source.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.8. Con: Religion has also fought against the political establishment.
1.13.2.2.2.2.1.1.1.8.1. Pro: Jesus Christ was actually breaking social [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilate's_court).
1.13.2.2.2.2.2. Con: If a totalitarian regime is also a religious one or atrocities are committed in the name of religion or because of it then religion cannot simply be separated from the regime and absolved of all blame.
1.13.2.2.3. Pro: During the 20th century, the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killings_under_Communist_regimes) ended killing around 20 million of their own people, despite the fact it was a secular society.
1.13.2.2.3.1. Con: This does not mean religion would have stopped the atrocity or that the atrocity was due to the lack of religion.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1. Con: What it does mean is that lack of religion is not correlated with success \(and conversely, religion is not correlated with lack of success\)
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1. Pro: There has not been a truly secular society until recently. The data set simply isn't big enough to determine if it is the secularization of society that allowed them to be more successful.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Even if it currently is impossible to determine if increased secularization causes more development, empirical evidence seems to support that more development does cause religiosity to decline.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Research points that religious belief declines in [economically developed countries](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069397111402465) with  “greater existential security, including income security \(income equality and redistribution via welfare states\) and improved health”.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: As scientific knowledge allows to reduce [uncertainty](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nigel-barber/why-atheism-to-replace-re_b_903653.html), in [democracies](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/why-atheism-will-replace-religion) with strong economies and welfare provisions people find less need to deal with the uncertainty of the future through religion.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Among those more [educated](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/04/26/in-america-does-more-education-equal-less-religion/), there is a tendency to have higher levels of [non belief](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/why-atheism-will-replace-religion) or to, at least, hold religious beliefs with less certainty.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Some studies show a negative correlation between [intelligence](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1088868313497266?journalCode=psra) and religiosity, possibly explained by the fact that intelligent people are less likely to conform to dogma and tend to adopt a [analytic](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6080/493) way of thinking.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: These studies may not take into account other variables. Since many positive social conditions \(education, urbanization, income, etc.\) also happen to be correlated with loss of religion, the link could be explained more by those causes than by intelligence and religion themselves.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Correlation does not indicate causation. Education could just as easily be structured in a way that attracts non-religious people.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Statistics show that [birth rates decrease](https://www.forbes.com/sites/currentevents/2012/10/16/warning-bell-for-developed-countries-declining-birth-rates/#7ba9e8963641) to dangerous levels in those same countries. Perhaps a decline in religious belief is not a good thing.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Religious beliefs — notably belief in hell, heaven, and an afterlife — tend to increase [economic growth](https://www.hoover.org/research/religion-and-economic-development). Religious beliefs are found to "raise productivity by fostering individual traits such as honesty, work ethic, and thrift".
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: At the cost of freedom: a workforce that lives under the threat of "hell" or some equivalent adverse effect which is unfounded.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Maybe \(if this is true\) the work ethic increases to make up for giving too much to the collection tray/box or because for the N people in a church N-1 are productive members of society. One just talks and consumes.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.2.3. Con: The parent's linked article is high on theory but has zero numbers. It states that it's speculating and raising the question, not drawing the conclusion. It is not support, but elaboration, leaving the parent unsupported.
1.13.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.2.4. Con: Linked article is pointing to Max Weber theory in "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism". This theory doens't confirm the thesis that religion is beneficial for economy.  First of all this book is really ancient stuff without real data. Second - this book states that only protestantism was beneficial for economy. This book was written as a critics of Marx theory and was biased.
1.13.2.2.3.2. Con: The fact that secular societies have also committed atrocities doesn't exonerate or ameliorate the atrocities committed in the name of religion.
1.13.2.2.4. Con: Secular war is a terrible thing and so is religious war. There being more secular wars does not diminish the atrociousness of religious war. That is still 75 million people who should not have been killed and this does not even count all the killings done in the name of religion outside of wars such as pograms, genocide, religious massacres, sacrifices or people dying of STDs because the churches preach against the use of condoms.
1.13.2.2.5. Con: Secular wars are fought over real things like resources, land, revenge, and water.  Religion is fought over made up gods which makes the losses from religious wars more pointless.
1.13.2.3. Pro: Opposing interests and capabilities of different groups set them on a war path.
1.13.2.4. Pro: Disruptions in the balance of power cause war, such as the rise of Japan vis-a-vis China spilled war over Asia.
1.13.2.5. Pro: Religions are just one of many mindsets that can be twisted to justify conflict.
1.13.2.5.1. Pro: Religion is not the cause of wars - people who think their religion is the only right religion, thereby not correctly following the religion are the cause of religion wars and persecution.
1.13.2.6. Pro: Religions help to inhibit war because they create similarities between societies.
1.13.2.6.1. Pro: Religions often have similar ethical outlooks, such as reverence to authorities.
1.13.2.7. Con: [The Crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) are a broad depiction of religious wars.
1.13.2.8. Con: There is much stigma about [Muslim terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism), making a strong position in the West against Islam that involves protest, and even violence towards Muslims whether or not they are terrorists, and in many situation, because of the person's religion, or presentation of their religion. This has been one big reason why American people are okay with the US being at war in countries that are have Islam as their dominant religion.
1.13.2.9. Con: Religions are the root cause of a lot of wars.
1.13.2.9.1. Pro: A few recent [conflicts that are fueled by religion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51299.Letter_to_a_Christian_Nation): Palestine \(Jews vs. Muslims\), the Balkans \(Orthodox Serbians vs. Catholic Croatians; Orthodox Serbians vs. Bosnian and Albanian Muslims\), Northern Ireland \(Protestants vs. Catholics\), Kashmir \(Muslims vs. Hindus\), Sudan \(Muslims vs. Christians and animists\), Nigeria \(Muslims vs. Christians\), Ethiopia and Eritrea \(Muslims vs. Christians\), Sri Lanka \(Sinhalese Buddhists vs. Tamil Hindus\), Indonesia \(Muslims vs. Timores e Christians\), ...
1.13.2.9.1.1. Pro: If religion had nothing to do with these conflicts, than we would expect to see mixed religions fight on the same side against people of their own religion. Instead, the lines are quite clear.
1.13.2.9.1.2. Con: Some conflicts are not easy to categorize. An example of would be the Ethiopia and Eritrean civil war - border disputes, greed and a botched independence war triggered by the united nations. Both sides have Muslims and Christian factions.
1.13.2.9.1.3. Con: The national disputes are difficult to tie to religion, most of the aforementioned examples demonstrate this; religion can be removed from the situation entirely and the conflict still remains. "Serbians vs. Croats, Serbians vs. Bosnia and Albania, Pakistan vs. India etc.

1.13.2.11. Pro: -> See 1.13.2.1.1.
1.13.3. Con: -> See 1.5.3.1.
1.13.4. Con: Not all religions promote violence, therefore it would be irresponsible to ban all religions on a global scale.
1.13.5. Con: Religion is not the main cause of war in the last hundred years for 90% of the conflicts in the world. Long time ago, people waged war in the name of God, but today, wars are being made by political and economical reasons - religion has nothing to do with that. As for the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s, how could people who were communists \(atheists by definition\) start wars based on religion? The reason are again political and economical, but not religious.
