Discussion Title: Will Jeremy Corbyn Will Be The Next Prime Minister Of The United Kingdom?

1. Jeremy Corbyn Will Be The Next Prime Minister Of The United Kingdom.
1.1. Con: Nothing is certain in politics right now. Political fortunes change fast and there is no perfect way of predicting the outcome of a general election.
1.1.1. Pro: Political predictions from almost all mainstream sources in media have been notoriously wrong and poor at predicting in the last couple years. We are experiencing social phenomenon with very few precedents in history.
1.1.2. Con: Election polls over and large are able to predict political outcomes.
1.1.2.1. Pro: They are generally reliable what is more often the problem is how they are interpreted and misrepresented in the media. Context is key.
1.1.2.2. Con: There is always the possibility of a sudden change of opinion, under the right circumstances. They cannot predict the future, just the present.
1.1.2.3. Con: Polls were wrong in the case of [Dewey vs Truman](http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/01/news/mn-38174) and in regard to [Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/upshot/a-2016-review-why-key-state-polls-were-wrong-about-trump.html).
1.1.3. Con: [Age](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/04/25/demographics-dividing-britain/) is currently a perfect predictor, and the right-wing elderly dying as the leftist youth come of voting age speaks strongly in favour of a positive trajectory for Corbyn.
1.2. Pro: The Conservative Party's minority government is unlikely to last its full five years.
1.2.1. Pro: All parties in power seem to have an arc from appearing credible, to appearing a bit stupid or tired. The current memorable moments to do with current liberal Conservatism is leading people towards the latter, so it's only so long before this wave of Conservatism ends.
1.2.2. Pro: The recent [Johnson-Gove letter](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/12/uk-government-tensions-rise-after-leak-of-letter-to-prime-minister) indicates that the position of the PM looks increasingly shaky.
1.3. Con: Polls indicate a [neck on neck](http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/poll-reveal-labour-popularity-under-13812683) race. However, at this moment there is considerable infighting in the Conservative party and once this is resolved Labour will not be able to profit anymore from it.
1.3.1. Pro: Labour is certainly helped by the total lack of competent figures at the top of the Tory party.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Theresa May is unable to open a leadership contest due to the repercussion on Brexit negotiations. This likely means that internal quarrels will persist.
1.3.1.2. Con: If they became united and started to present a single coherent plan for the nation's future, particularly regarding Brexit, this could change. However, this is now impossible task for Theresa May; unless a seriously capable successor took over soon the trend wouldn't reverse, and even then it would be tough during Brexit talks.
1.3.2. Con: The position of Labour has improved significantly since depriving May of a majority. The party is united, determined and more serious than ever in its planning to win the next general election, whenever it may be. There are a whole raft of new marginal constituencies for the Conservative party, and even the SNP, that given the oppurtunity are quite likely to flip to Labour. The last election that party machine was still fighting a defensive campaign in reluctant support of Corbyn, not this time.
1.3.3. Con: The civil war in the Conservative party is highly unlikely to be resolved. This is simply the latest bout of the long-running war that has underpinned Conservative politics for half a century. The last three Tory PMs have been destroyed by conflict over Europe, while other figures like Ted Heath and Ken Clarke have been polarising because of their pro-EU views from the 70s to now. The Tories are even less likely to be able to heal this wound with Brexit as the biggest issue in British politics.
1.4. Pro: The Conservative Party would be unlikely to win an election under current circumstances.
1.4.1. Con: The majority of British newspapers would be strongly opposed to a Labour Party victory under Jeremy's leadership and would certainly attack him and his allies at least as strong as the last election
1.4.1.1. Pro: [London School of Economics study of media coverage of Jeremy Corbyn](http://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/research/research-projects/representations-of-jeremy-corbyn)

To quote: "Our analysis shows that Corbyn was thoroughly delegitimised as a political actor from the moment he became a prominent candidate and even more so after he was elected as party leader, with a strong mandate. This process of delegitimisation occurred in several ways: 1\) through lack of or distortion of voice; 2\) through ridicule, scorn and personal attacks; and 3\) through association, mainly with terrorism."
1.4.2. Pro: Theresa May has lost all authority.
1.4.2.1. Pro: She led one of the [worst election campaigns](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-speech-live-election-campaign-apology-conservative-party-conference-a7982371.html) in decades and it backfired spectacularly. It cost her Government its majority and herself all credibility.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: The Conservatives remained the largest party in Parliament.
1.4.2.2. Con: She remains prime minister and leader of the Conservative Party, so although she has to some extent and in some quarters earned a reputation as politically weak or weakened, and unable to exert either political or moral authority, this is a purely subjective opinion and does not represent an evidenced basis for further argument.
1.4.3. Pro: Public approval for the Government's handling of Brexit negotiations has been steadily falling for months, a majority now disapprove.[The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/07/exclusive-poll-shows-public-have-lost-faith-theresa-mays-handling/)
1.4.3.1. Pro: The Government's progress in Brexit negotiations has stalled and the prospect of a palatable deal being reached before March 2019, as well as passing all stages of ratification both in the EU and UK parliaments, is looking less and less likely as time goes on.
1.5. Con: Corbyn has already tried his very best and lost against somebody widely regarded as the worst Prime Minister in British History.
1.6. Pro: Jeremy Corbyn's position as leader of the Labour Party is secure for the foreseeable future.
1.6.1. Pro: After being dismissed as 'certain to lose' a general election he went on to secure the largest increase in votes achieved by any of the party's leaders since 1945[The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-election-result-vote-share-increased-1945-clement-attlee-a7781706.html)
1.6.1.1. Con: He lost against one of the least respected Prime Ministers in known history.
1.6.1.2. Con: Much of that increase in votes will have been due to the exceptional campaign by Theresa May, not to mention her outstanding conduct as PM in the preceding months.
1.6.2. Con: There will always be a core of people who are ideologically opposed to a leader who openly pursues a socialist agenda.
1.6.3. Con: This makes the party much less likely to win.
1.6.4. Con: The best thing for the party and the country would be for Jeremy Corbyn to step down. He has done what he was elected to do, which was to change the direction of the party, but he is simply too divisive to remain leader.
It is not impossible that he might recognise that fact.
1.6.5. Pro: Corbyn has won two leadership elections in a row with significant majorities.
1.6.5.1. Con: The people that voted for him make up less than 0.1% of the electorate: they are not a representative sample.
1.7. Pro: It is perhaps only the thought of Corbyn being Prime Minister that holds the house back from a vote of no confidence. If such a vote passes then Corbyn becomes PM by default... if only for a fortnight.
1.8. Pro: The greatest current predictor of voting tendency is [age](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/04/25/demographics-dividing-britain/), with younger voters more likely to vote Labour and older voters more likely to vote Conservative. This means that, every day \(on balance\) Conservative voters are dying, and Labour voters coming of age. They are currently roughly neck-and-neck in the polls; it's only a matter of time.
1.9. Con: The Labour Party will split into two parties if Labour win a general election; Momentum and the Labour Party. This could well happen before a general election. Jeremy Corbyn never wanted to be the PM he just wanted to own Labour.[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/18/secret-tape-reveals-momentum-plot-to-link-with-unite-seize-control-of-labour) [newstatesman.com](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/08/labour-party-split-inevitable-corbyn-MPs) [uk.businessinsider.com](http://uk.businessinsider.com/evidence-jeremy-corbyn-doesnt-want-to-be-prime-minister-2016-7)
1.10. Con: If Theresa May resigned as leader of the Conservative Party it would not necessarily trigger a general election, even though there would be significant pressure to do so as they are currently a minority government
1.10.1. Pro: Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act \(2011\) a two-thirds majority in parliament is required to call an early election, ie before five years.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011)
1.10.2. Con: It would be extremely hard to justify a new PM taking over without another election. However frustrating it may seem to the public to vote again so soon, most people would still believe it necessary. The alternative is having our second un-elected Prime Minister taking office in only two years.
1.10.2.1. Pro: Theresa May herself took the office without a general election and as this didn't work out great the appetite for more is likely to be minimal.
1.10.2.1.1. Pro: Conservative HQ would not allow the same mistakes to be made again. In only a year the party has gone from triumphant confidence, bordering arrogance, to humiliated, in crisis and genuinely afraid Corbyn will become PM.
1.11. Con: The most likely route to a change of government is currently a vote of no confidence, after which there would be two weeks for somebody to form a government that commands the confidence of the House. That would need a coalition and none of the other parties would work with Corbyn.
