Discussion Title: Should Psychiatrists Be Allowed to Diagnose Trump?

1. The American Psychiatry Association should repeal the Goldwater Rule and allow psychiatrists to publicly diagnose Trump.
1.1. Pro: The American public has a right to medical and psychiatric knowledge about Trump.
1.1.1. Con: Having a mental illness is not necessarily a barrier to someone carrying out a task successfully.
1.1.1.1. Con: Psychiatrists claim that Trump's behavior shows that his delusional ideas come up when he is stressed and he is likely to lose track of reality because it does not fit what he believes. Such characteristics in a president can be [immensely damaging](http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/donald-trump-mental-health) for the entire country. Hence with Trump particularly, his mental illness can very likely impact how the country is run.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Trump's aggressive behavior and harsh rhetoric towards North Korea — which included deriding North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “[Little Rocket Man](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-updates-everything-president-trump-calls-kim-jong-un-little-rocket-1512093131-htmlstory.html)” — created [a real risk of war](https://www.vox.com/2017/9/28/16375158/north-korea-nuclear-war-trump-kim-jong-un) between USA and North Korea.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Many people with mental illnesses learn [coping strategies and function well](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/resolution-not-conflict/201708/what-is-mental-illness-does-trump-have-one) as responsible members of society.
1.1.1.3. Con: It is not having a mental illness that would disqualify an individual from a public role in society; rather it is the development of a mental illness to the point of being dysfunctional or dangerous. That can only be ascertained if psychiatrists can make public diagnoses of individuals.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Dr. Dodes, a psychiatrist, has said that Trump appears to be [suffering from psychopathy and psychosis](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-psychopath-psychosis-mental-health-danger-us-president-goldwater-rule-psychiatrist-a8084726.html). If this is the case, the public deserve to know, as he is unfit to make decisions which would affect their lives.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: Trump's [inclination to distort reality](https://bigthink.com/stephen-johnson/why-psychiatrists-are-calling-on-the-apa-to-end-its-goldwater-rule) and to attack facts is only likely to increase as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. Hence the more power Trump attains, the more compromised his judgment is likely to get. Such instability shows that Trump is incapable of safely serving as president.
1.1.1.3.1.3. Pro: It has been reported that [all of the people](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/08/health/trump-physical-mental-health/index.html) around Trump believe that he's incapable of carrying out the duties of office.
1.1.1.3.1.4. Con: According to former President of USA [Jimmy Carter](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/22/politics/jimmy-carter-new-york-times-interview/index.html), the media have been harder on Trump than any other president and feel free to claim that Trump is mentally deranged without hesitation.
1.1.1.3.1.5. Pro: Akin to pedophiles being on public record to protect the children in their neighborhood, a public leader should have no problem being evaluated since his decisions and actions could have disastrous effects on the public if left unchecked psychologically. There should be no reason to hide if everything is fine, and voters should know ahead of time.
1.1.1.3.1.6. Pro: Trump has shown signs of [erratic, sudden decision](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/10/30/despite-goldwater-rule-psychiatrists-see-analyzing/?slreturn=20180618153042) making in moments when he loses touch with reality, which confirm many of the diagnosis offered by psychiatrists. For example, he launched 59 missiles at Syria, within 72 hours, of seeing an image on the news that he didn’t like.
1.1.1.3.1.7. Pro: Trump is particularly aggressive towards [immigrants and minorities](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/10/30/despite-goldwater-rule-psychiatrists-see-analyzing/?slreturn=20180618153042) within the United States, who are already at a disadvantage. If Trump is mentally ill, it puts these groups in particular danger; as his erratic and compromised decision-making ability can result in policies that adversely impact these groups.
1.1.1.3.1.8. Con: People, working very close to the President, have [shot down](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/08/health/trump-physical-mental-health/index.html) any assertions regarding his mental health. They claim that the President is completely capable and suitable for this role.
1.1.1.4. Con: Although plenty of people successfully manage to live their lives while suffering from mental health issues, the mental health of the President of the United States is a different story to a normal person. The US needs a leader with exceptional health both physically and mentally in order to have a clear judgement to safely lead the country.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Any person who is not of sound mind, or has trouble distinguishing the imaginary from reality, should not hold public office, as their decision making skills for their constituents would be impacted.
1.1.1.5. Con: Mental illness cannot be generalised. With many types and severities of mental illness, people cope in different ways. While others cope well despite having mental health problems, it is not possible to assume Trump will also be able to function successfully in such a powerful role.
1.1.1.6. Con: Whether or not Trump has a mental illness does not necessarily qualify or disqualify him from being President. However when looking at his presidency and mistakes, a more [accurate understanding](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2017/07/psychiatrists_shouldn_t_have_to_follow_the_goldwater_rule.html) of what exactly arises from his mental health versus what he can be blamed for in general, would be useful.
1.1.1.7. Pro: Prior to being elected, Trump was a highly successful businessman with a [net worth](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/donald-trump-success-story/) between $3.9 billion and $10 billion. In order to get to that level of wealth and success he already has shown he is capable of achieving and being successful at a high level, even if he is mentally unwell.
1.1.1.7.1. Con: Trump has been declared [bankrupt](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/21/hillary-clinton/yep-donald-trumps-companies-have-declared-bankrupt/) [six times](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/?utm_term=.6197512e9748)
1.1.1.7.2. Con: Much of [Trumps money](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/03/trumps-false-claim-he-built-his-empire-with-a-small-loan-from-his-father/) came from his [father](https://www.alternet.org/story/156234/exposing_how_donald_trump_really_made_his_fortune%3A_inheritance_from_dad_and_the_government%27s_protection_mostly_did_the_trick) and what some would consider [underhanded](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35836623) [business dealings](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/donald-trump-rich/).
1.1.1.8. Pro: President Lincoln [suffered](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/resolution-not-conflict/201708/what-is-mental-illness-does-trump-have-one) from severe depression for most of his life; JFK used to overuse testosterone-based anabolic steroids in order to treat his Addison's disease, to the point where he became manic, erratic and error-prone in his judgement and Thomas Jefferson was on the autistic spectrum. Yet all three are beloved former American presidents.
1.1.1.8.1. Pro: According to Dr. Nassir Ghaemi, a professor of psychiatry at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and author of "[A First-Rate Madness](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/11/books/a-first-rate-madness-by-nassir-ghaemi-review.html)", some of the greatest figures in history, such as Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln, suffered from episodes of depression and benefited from it in times of crisis. People with [mild manic symptoms](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/08/health/trump-physical-mental-health/index.html) are more creative and more resilient to stress than normal mentally healthy people.
1.1.1.8.2. Con: Just because previous presidents had mental health problems does not mean this is an acceptable benchmark for the current president or future presidents to come.
1.1.1.8.3. Pro: A [2006 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16462555) in The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disorders [evaluated](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/some-of-our-most-beloved-presidents-likely-experienced-mental-illness_us_57b49129e4b0edfa80daaca0) the mental health of 37 US presidents who served between 1776 and 1974, starting with George Washington and ending with Richard Nixon. With caveats about the difficulty of psychologically diagnosing the dead, three psychiatrists analyzed the biographies of these figures and concluded that 18 of them may have had psychiatric disorders at some point. Ten seemed to have been affected while in office.
1.1.2. Pro: Former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, [Hugo Black](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/will-trump-be-the-death-of-the-goldwater-rule) has argued that the public has the right to have the character of their president or a potential presidential candidate held up for a complete scrutiny. The psychiatric underpinnings of irresponsible and reckless statements are an essential part of the process by which voters inform themselves of the qualities of their potential president.
1.1.2.1. Pro: [John Kennedy](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/12/the-medical-ordeals-of-jfk/305572/) had [Addison's disease](https://thetyee.ca/Books/2011/09/16/Mentally-Ill-Leaders/) which was hidden from the public in his election campaigns. This most likely impacted his ability to handle stressful situations as during stressful periods of his administration, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, he has been documented to consume an extraordinary variety of medications including steroids. Hence considering that often a candidate's mental health can impact their ability to handle stress, the public has a right to this information.
1.1.2.2. Con: Voters can evaluate irresponsible and reckless statements sufficiently without commentary by psychiatrists.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Trump's unnerving "my nuclear button is bigger and more powerful" [tweets](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42549687) are a reminder that the stakes are extremely high, therefore it is imperative for the American public to know whether their president is truly fit for office.
1.1.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.2.3.2. Pro: The President of the USA is also the [Commander-in-Chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-Chief_of_the_United_States_Armed_Forces) of the US armed forces and therefore has the ultimate responsibility for the direction and disposition of the military.
1.1.2.3.2.1. Con: There are checks and balances within the US political system to stop abuse of this power by presidents. The power to declare war is therefore [constitutionally vested](https://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec8.html) in Congress. The President can direct the military only after a Congressional declaration of war.
1.1.2.3.2.1.1. Pro: [The War Powers Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution) is the federal law intended to check the president's power to commit the United States to an armed conflict without the consent of the US Congress. It requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and forbids armed forces from remaining for more than 60 days, with a further 30-day withdrawal period, without a Congressional authorization for use of military force or a declaration of war by the United States.
1.1.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: This time period is enough to substantially hurt the US or any other country involved, especially if this war leads to the use of nuclear weapons by any side.
1.1.2.3.2.2. Pro: The President of USA has [unilateral authority](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/science/donald-trump-nuclear-codes.html?_r=1) as commander-in-chief to order that nuclear weapons be used for any reason at any time. The Secretary of Defense has legal authority to approve the order \(under [a two-man rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-man_rule#United_States:_nuclear_weapons)\), but [cannot veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Command_Authority) it.
1.1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: If the Secretary of Defense does not concur to the President's order, then the President may in his sole discretion [fire the Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Command_Authority). Trump, who is known for [firing his staff](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/07/25/heres-a-list-of-people-trump-has-fired-or-threatened-to-fire/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d78153610df2), is most likely to take this route than change his mind.
1.1.2.3.2.2.2. Pro: The President of USA is always accompanied by a military aide carrying a briefcase \(known as the [nuclear football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_football)\) with launch codes for nuclear weapons. The contents of the briefcase are to be used by the President to authorize a nuclear attack while away from fixed command centers. This means that Trump, with his [infamous temper](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/14/politics/donald-trump-temper/index.html) and potential mental health issues, is never more than an arm's reach away from the briefcase that can start the process of launching a nuclear strike.
1.1.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.6.
1.1.2.3.4. Pro: Even if there is a slight chance that the diagnosis is true; having Trump in office can end up compromising democracy for the United States.  Trump is a person who only cares about himself, he is also perfectly willing to trample on others’ rights to serve his interest; this behavior is [incompatible with democracy](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/10/30/despite-goldwater-rule-psychiatrists-see-analyzing/?slreturn=20180618153042).
1.1.3. Con: For that purpose, presidents could be required to pass mental health exams or formal psychological and psychiatric evaluations before taking office in the United States. Repealing the Goldwater rule is therefore not necessary.
1.1.3.1. Con: Mental health changes over time.
1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.1.5. Pro: The psychological health of the President of the United States can have a significant impact on the country going forward. Allowing psychiatrists to diagnose Trump allows the government to ensure that the president is properly able to do his job. Sharing the diagnosis with the public protects this knowledge from being hidden and ignored.
1.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.1.6. Con: All patients have a [right](http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/protection-of-privacy-and-confidentiality-as-a-patient-right-physicians-and-nurses-viewpoints.html) to privacy, this includes the restriction to access of information i.e. the American public having knowledge of Trump's health. This basic human right is recognised and guaranteed by a number of laws and international conventions.
1.1.6.1. Con: Public figures often give up [privacy rights](http://strongarticle.com/news/politicians-right-privacy-vs-publics-right-know/) when they seek to be elected officials.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: Necessity \(a circumstance in which grave harm or death is likely to occur without intervention\) is a [recognised exception](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3725243/) to requiring consent before conducting a diagnosis. The President of the United States potentially being unfit to hold the most powerful office in the world is a situation which could lead to grave harm.
1.1.6.1.1.1. Pro: Some psychiatrists feel that they have a [social responsibility](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psychiatry-in-society/201806/mental-health-experts-urge-revision-the-goldwater-rule) to warn the public when they discern danger to its well-being. This danger can arise from concerns regarding the mental health state of a public figure who is in a powerful position.
1.1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: This social responsibility can be seen as an extension of the principle of [the duty to protect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_protect), which is the responsibility of a mental health professional to protect patients and others from foreseeable harm.
1.1.6.1.1.1.2. Con: Feelings are irrelevant. Some anti-abortionists also feel they have [a moral duty to kill doctors](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/29/us/30abortion-clinic-violence.html) who assist in abortion.
1.1.6.1.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.5.
1.1.6.1.1.1.4. Pro: Psychiatrists have many social roles and identities, and it is inappropriate for the profession and the APA to expect that professional responsibilities will be prioritized in every instance.
1.1.6.1.2. Con: Even public figures retain a [reasonable expectation](http://www.sbc.org.pl/Content/11963/doherty.pdf) of privacy about certain elements of their life, which arguably could include their medical history.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: In [Editions Plon v France \(2006\) 42 EHRR 36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plon_\(Society\)_v._France), the European Court of Human Rights ruled that citizens had a legitimate right to be informed about a serious illness in their Head of State [\(p. 49\)](http://www.sbc.org.pl/Content/11963/doherty.pdf).
1.1.6.1.4. Pro: In a democracy, a leader is elected through the consent of the governed. The governed cannot consent fully if key information is kept from them. Hence the public deserves to be aware of Trump's mental state regardless of his consent.
1.1.6.2. Pro: A [patient's right to privacy](http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/protection-of-privacy-and-confidentiality-as-a-patient-right-physicians-and-nurses-viewpoints.html) involves the confidentiality of information related to the patient and bodily privacy of the patient.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: Psychiatry recognizes the ['Duty to warn' and the 'Duty to protect'](https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/apa-blog/2018/01/what-do-we-mean-by-duty-to-warn) which provide an exception to confidentiality requirements allowing mental health professionals to disclose confidential mental health information under specific circumstances.
1.1.6.2.1.1. Con: The ruling introducing the ['Duty to protect'](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychiatry-dangerousness-president/page/0/1) emphasizes that therapists have a duty to protect individuals who their patients are physically threatening. Thus, the rule only applies to psychiatrists and patients who have a therapist-patient relationship in legal terms. It does not apply broadly to psychiatrists and the public at large.
1.1.6.3. Pro: The [right to privacy](http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/protection-of-privacy-and-confidentiality-as-a-patient-right-physicians-and-nurses-viewpoints.html) constitutes a social merit as it encourages the explicit discussion of health-related problems between clinicians and patients.
1.1.6.4. Con: Trump does not have confidential relationships with all psychiatrists, as he is not their patient.
1.1.7. Con: The public's right to knowledge of the President is not unlimited. Even if people can rightfully demand that the White House physician examines the President, that does not necessarily mean all such information must be publicly revealed.
1.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.
1.1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.1.9. Pro: The [25th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) exists to protect the US from the possibility of being ruled by someone mentally incompetent to do so. The Goldwater Rule infringes the right of the people to invoke the amendment.
1.1.9.1. Con: The process of invoking [Section 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_4:_Vice_Presidential%E2%80%93Cabinet_declaration) of the 25th amendment \(that gives the Congress, vice president and Cabinet the ability to effectively remove the powers from the President\) is more [difficult than impeachment](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/unpacked/2017/06/09/the-25th-amendment/) and is [reserved only](https://www.cheatsheet.com/culture/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-25th-amendment.html/?a=viewall) for truly unique and dire circumstances, like mental incapacity or a major psychotic break.
1.1.9.2. Con: The invocation of the amendment during a Trump presidency isn't realistic because the vast majority of Trump's Cabinet would need to support the president's removal. There is no evidence that Vice President Mike Pence or the majority of Trump's Cabinet have turned on him.
1.1.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.8.
1.1.9.3. Con: The 25th Amendment requires showing that the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” Even if Trump has a mental illness, it would not constitute the suggested [prima facie case](https://jonathanturley.org/2017/10/26/trump-the-25th-amendment-and-the-demise-of-the-goldwater-rule/) \(case with sufficient evidence\) for his removal. The question is whether he is capable of discharging these duties, which cannot be determined simply through a psychiatric diagnosis.
1.1.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.10. Pro: Still, Trump's public persona is the face of the nation, and if this face exhibits traits of mental illness, then it should be diagnosed so that both the country and its current leader can be better off, either through the actual diagnosis and fixing of whatever illness the persona might have, or through finding that Trump himself has the actual illness and then solving that however the situation is at that time.
1.1.11. Pro: At a time where information, fake news and gossip is at our finger tips, the subject of Trump's mental health is particularly rampant with speculation. It would be strange for such important psychiatric knowledge to be withheld when already his mental health is closely monitored and the centre of conversation in public discussion.
1.1.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.
1.2. Pro: The consequences of irresponsibly diagnosing Trump, or any public figure, are sufficiently severe, such that psychiatrists will only publicly diagnose someone when they are sure they have enough information to make that diagnosis. The Goldwater rule is therefore an unnecessary restriction on psychiatrists.
1.2.1. Pro: It is very unlikely that psychiatrists would want to risk their professional reputation and livelihood unless they felt it was completely necessary.
1.2.1.1. Con: Psychiatrists may face incentives of fame or pressure from the media, which could motivate them to speak publicly in contravention of their professional ethics.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: "Fire and Fury," Michael Wolff's "tell all" book on the Trump Administration was an instant best-seller and stands to earn him [nearly $10 million](http://time.com/money/5100640/heres-how-much-michael-wolff-could-make-from-fire-and-fury-sales/). Such results indicate that there is profit to be gained from commenting on Trump's instability and could inspire a psychiatrist to make sensationalist remarks.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Public diagnoses of political figures, particularly during electoral campaigns, adds a new dimension to potential smear campaign tactics. In cases of corruption, it would be possible for political parties or large lobbying organisations to financially motivate a particular diagnosis in order to erode confidence in their rivals.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Psychiatrists who have contributed to the book, 'The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump', have faced [massive public back clash](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/10/were-psychiatrists-its-perfectly-healthy-to-question-the-presidents-mental-state-216266). They have also been condemned by the APA. The contributors claim that they felt this was their duty. Considering that the contributors surely would have anticipated the consequences of publishing the book and yet decided to publish it shows that they felt it was necessary.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Regardless of the Goldwater rule, psychiatrists ought to anyway have enough information before making any diagnosis whether public or not.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: [Experts](https://archive.org/stream/BandyLeeTheDangerousCaseOfDonaldTrumppdfRoflcopter2110WWRG/Bandy%20Lee%20-%20The%20Dangerous%20Case%20of%20Donald%20Trump%20%28pdf%29%20-%20roflcopter2110%20%5BWWRG%5D_djvu.txt) who have commented on Trump's mental condition argue that while a formal psychiatric diagnosis can only be reached after proper evaluation, it is quite possible to comment on an individual's mental condition by simply observing their [behavior](https://www.psychcongress.com/article/goldwater-rule-outdated).
1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Numerous studies](https://www.statnews.com/2017/12/06/goldwater-rule-psychiatry/) show that the in-person interview assessment can be misleading as patients can lie and hide facts. On the other hand observing Trump's behaviour in public, his writing, speeches and even tweets can provide more accurate insight into his mental health.
1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: [An analysis](https://psyarxiv.com/j3gmf/) published in Perspectives on Psychological Science reviewed a large body of published scientific literature [which showed](http://esciencecommons.blogspot.com/2017/12/goldwater-rule-gagging-psychiatrists-no.html) that in-person examination is not necessary in the presence of other valid sources of information. Extensive public records in the form of interviews with the media, biographies, social media accounts, and YouTube videos as well as interviews with friends, family, and others well familiar with the person can reveal longstanding behavioral patterns.
1.2.1.3.1.3. Pro: Particularly in Trump's case, there is enough available information for psychiatrists to estimate how [dangerous](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/01/10/were-psychiatrists-its-perfectly-healthy-to-question-the-presidents-mental-state-216266) he can be in a position of power.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Psychiatrists argue that Trump's [digital trail](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/5/25/15680354/psychiatry-goldwater-rule-trump) makes him one of the most analyzable public figures in history. He has over thirty-four thousand tweets, hundreds of television appearances, and a huge trove of journalism documenting his every action. Hence in his case, an observation from afar is not necessarily inferior to an in-person observation.
1.2.1.3.1.3.1.1. Con: Public figures, for different purposes, portray an [altered image](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/24/health/trump-mental-illness-professionals-question-goldwater-rule/index.html) of themselves. It is likely that their public opinions and actions are not a representation of their internal thoughts and ideas. It is therefore possible that Trump's behavior is a tactic to gain more attention and does not actually represent his thoughts, hence this information is insufficient for evaluation.
1.2.1.3.1.4. Pro: Direct examination [isn’t essential](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/07/24/the-ghost-of-barry-goldwater-and-the-censorship-of-american-psychiatrists/) to psychiatric practice, nor is it uncommon to make diagnoses without relying on the direct examination of the patient. There is a unique phenomenon in psychiatry called “[lack of insight](http://blogs.jpmsonline.com/2017/02/14/lack-of-insight-in-psychiatric-patients-how-it-affects-mental-health/),” which means that part of having a mental illness is that the patient doesn’t realize that they have an illness. It is often common to ignore what delusional or addicted patients claim, and to rely on the report of family, friends, police, and others.
1.2.1.3.1.5. Con: The general consensus within the medical and medical history communities, at variance to the Goldwater Rule, is that diagnoses based upon records, whether historical or contemporary, written, visual, or auditory, can be as accurate as diagnoses made by direct examination \(The Ethics of APA’s Goldwater Rule,[pg.5](http://mehr.tums.ac.ir/Upload/Journal/aeb43ca5-e5cf-4d4a-b7a4-7c1b36f30984.pdf)\).
1.2.1.3.1.5.1. Pro: There is a long academic tradition of psychohistory that requires making psychiatric assessments based on written records and accounts. [Psychohistory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory) and [psychobiography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychobiography) are broadly accepted and respected domains of clinical research in which diagnoses are made and [psychodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamics) formulated in the absence of personal evaluations.
1.2.1.3.1.5.1.1. Pro: Erik Erikson’s biographies of [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Man_Luther) and[Mahatma Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhi%27s_Truth) and John Mack’s biography of [T. E. Lawrence](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674704947&content=reviews) are three well-known and respected examples of psychobiographies. The biographies of Gandhi and T. E. Lawrence won a Pulitzer Prize each.
1.2.1.3.1.5.1.2. Pro: By applying a theory of personality that consisted of 20 psychogenic needs, [Dr. Henry Murray](http://lawandreligion.com/sites/law-religion/files/Evaluation-Analysis-Dorpat.pdf) described Hitler's personality as "counteractive narcissism", and was able to correctly predict the German leader's suicide in the face of his country's defeat.
1.2.1.3.1.6. Pro: Even the Goldwater rule itself [acknowledges](http://jaapl.org/content/44/2/226.long) that "on occasion psychiatrists are asked for an opinion about an individual who is in the light of public attention or who has disclosed information about himself/herself through public media. In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general."
1.2.1.3.1.7. Con: Public figures, especially politicians, intentionally cultivate a public persona that may not accurately reflect their psychological state. [Given the risk](http://jaapl.org/content/44/3/407.2.long) and potential harm of error, it would be unwise to allow psychiatrists to render an opinion of a public figure's subjective thoughts or motivations, conscious or unconscious, in the absence of a personal and value-free diagnostic interview.
1.2.1.3.1.7.1. Pro: There is risk that psychiatrists who want to provide public diagnosis are doing so for a political purpose rather than mental emotional health purpose. There is a greater risk of bias and non-objectivity.
1.2.1.3.1.7.2. Pro: Someone's performance on reality TV, such as Trump on The Apprentice, may be dramatized to improve ratings, and therefore not accurately represent their personality or psychological state.
1.2.1.3.1.8. Con: Even a comment by a psychiatrist, made on the basis of inaccurate or insufficient information, can be [manipulated or misunderstood](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/24/health/trump-mental-illness-professionals-question-goldwater-rule/index.html) by the media and the public. This can heavily compromise a candidate's reputation.
1.2.1.4. Pro: The Goldwater rule has not silenced [everyone](https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/qvzbyv/donald-trump-mental-health-goldwater-rule); there are [health professionals](http://www.adutytowarn.org/) who have chosen to ignore the rule. They see it as their moral responsibility to share their expertise with the public.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.1.
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: In contradiction to the dominant American Psychiatric Association, the smaller yet influential psychiatry group the American Psychoanalytic Association [encourages](https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/25/psychiatry-goldwater-rule-trump/) members to “not feel bound” by the Goldwater Rule.
1.2.2. Pro: The premise behind the Goldwater Rule is that psychiatrists should not speculate and make a diagnosis without conducting an extensive in person study including an interview with the president. This [outdated approach](https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/qvzbyv/donald-trump-mental-health-goldwater-rule) is no longer relevant in current times.
1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.5.
1.2.2.2. Con: Psychiatrists have described Trump as 'dangerous'. However, in psychiatry, the [“dangerousness”](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychiatry-dangerousness-president/page/0/2) of a patient must be assessed according to well-established procedures, including face-to-face, clinical evaluation. It also includes evaluation of many other factors that cannot be assessed without an in-person evaluation.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Elements of evaluating 'dangerousness' [include such factors](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/psychiatry-dangerousness-president/page/0/2) as the specific person threatened; presence of a specific plan; past history of violence; psychiatric diagnosis, presence of command hallucinations; history of impulsivity; alcohol and other substance misuse, and many other factors that cannot be assessed without an in-person evaluation.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Third-party payers, expert witnesses in law cases, and historical psychobiographers make diagnoses [without conducting formal interviews](http://jaapl.org/content/44/2/226.long).
1.2.2.4. Pro: The warranted psychological assessment itself has been criticised by [former members](https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/qvzbyv/donald-trump-mental-health-goldwater-rule) of the APA. They have deemed the necessary medical studies to satisfy the Goldwater Rule to be unreliable. For example, a narcissistic personality is not easily identifiable in a brief study.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Today's technology provides us with the accessibility to follow and analyse Trump's online footprint and documented footage from years of being in the public eye; this is [highly valuable](https://tonic.vice.com/en_us/article/qvzbyv/donald-trump-mental-health-goldwater-rule) for assessing his mental health.
1.2.2.5.1. Pro: Video and audio recordings of Trump \(such as the [Access Hollywood tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape)\) have already provided useful context and information about Trump's personality.
1.2.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.3.
1.2.2.5.3. Pro: There are fourteen seasons of the reality TV show, [The Apprentice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_\(U.S._TV_series\)), which Trump hosted.
1.2.2.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.7.2.
1.2.3. Con: [The Goldwater rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwater_rule) only applies to those who are members of the APA \(American Psychiatric Association\). This is not a licensing board and even if they are removed they are still permitted to practice psychiatry, meaning the consequences of speaking out are minimal under the status quo.
1.2.3.1. Con: The APA [offers](https://apafdn.org/psychiatrists/grants,-fellowships-awards) funding and various grants for research, money that psychiatrists would lose access to if they broke the Goldwater rule.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: This is not a deterrent to most psychiatrists - the majority are engaged in clinical work; the numbers involved in research are much [smaller.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3661249/)
1.2.4. Con: While theoretically breaking the Goldwater Rule could result in having to go before a medical board for a hearing, this has [never happened.](https://www.thecut.com/2017/07/its-time-to-retire-the-goldwater-rule.html)
1.2.4.1. Con: While no one has lost their license as a result of violating the Goldwater rule, it is not [trivial](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/will-trump-be-the-death-of-the-goldwater-rule) to be reported to your licensing board for an ethics violation. While the psychiatrist can still practice, a public state censure ultimately effects the sustainability of that practice.
1.2.5. Pro: There are legal restraints to stop psychiatrists from making inappropriate or careless public diagnoses that negate the need for the Goldwater Rule. A suspected diagnosis that damages the reputation of an individual can count as [libel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation).
1.2.5.1. Con: Proving libel against a public figure requires demonstrating malicious intent or recklessness, which can be difficult.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: [Actual malice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_malice) in United States law is a legal requirement imposed upon public officials or public figures when they file suit for libel. Unlike other individuals who are less well-known to the general public, public officials and public figures are held to a higher standard for what they must prove before they may succeed in a defamation lawsuit.
1.2.5.2. Con: The risk of this type of civil action is minimal. Data from 1991 through 2005 shows that among those practicing in other specialties, psychiatrists have the lowest annual probability of facing a malpractice claim \([2.6%](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1012370)\).
1.2.5.2.1. Con: This is true in the status quo, but does not mean it will remain true once psychiatrists start making public diagnoses of officials.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Pro: Trump has [indicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/politics/can-trump-change-libel-laws.html) his support \([via Twitter posts](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/847455180912181249) and [official statements](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/business/media/trump-libel-laws.html)\) for changing libel laws to make it easier to prosecute critical media coverage.
1.2.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Libel law is a state-law tort, [meaning](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/politics/can-trump-change-libel-laws.html) that state courts and state legislatures control the standards and Trump has no direct ability to influence these changes.
1.2.5.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Supreme Court’s 1964 decision in [New York Times v. Sullivan](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/376/254) placed constitutional limits on how states can define libel. Changing the law would require either the Supreme Court to overrule it or a constitutional amendment.
1.2.5.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Mr. Trump [could](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/politics/can-trump-change-libel-laws.html) try to appoint Supreme Court justices who would vote to overturn the precedent.
1.2.5.2.1.1.2. Con: Trump's stance on libel laws is better understood as a [reactionary response](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/business/media/trump-libel-laws.html) to the publishing of ["Fire and Fury"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/books/review/trump-michael-wolff.html) rather than a committed policy agenda.
1.2.5.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Trump made some of these statements about libel laws on the 2016 Presidential [campaign trail](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/business/media/trump-libel-laws.html), before the book "Fire and Fury" was published.
1.2.5.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Trump has contradicted himself and joked about libel laws, [saying](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/business/media/donald-trump-new-york-times.html) he personally might be in trouble if the laws were loosened.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Senator Barry Goldwater, the presidential candidate after whom this rule is named, [successfully sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwater_v._Ginzburg) Ralph Ginzburg, the editor and publisher of Fact, for libel.
1.2.5.4. Con: Libel laws exist to protect ["a good reputation honestly earned,"](https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/10/10-1253.pdf) and some experts have suggested President Trump's [reputation has already been too self-tarnished](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/13/us/politics/david-mccraw-trump-letter.html) for other people's comments to cause significant harm.
1.2.5.4.1. Pro: A lawyer for the New York Times defended an article criticizing Mr. Trump's degrading comments about women \(which Trump objected to as libel\) by [stating](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/13/us/politics/david-mccraw-trump-letter.html), “Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself."
1.2.5.4.1.1. Con: This statement was specifically about Trump's reputation regarding women, and would not apply to comments about the state of Trump's mental health.
1.3. Con: Simply observing Trump in his public capacity does not give any psychiatrist enough information to make a proper evaluation; most diagnoses would be inaccurate as they would rely on incomplete information.
1.3.1. Con: A one-on-one examination of Trump would bind the psychiatrist to not speak about Trump as that would violate patient-client confidentiality; requiring Trump to be examined personally in order for him to be discussed publicly would violate medical ethics.
1.3.2. Con: Mental-health experts are [routinely](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/will-trump-be-the-death-of-the-goldwater-rule) asked in legal cases to offer opinions on defendants based on information from files, without an in-person examination - for example, to help assess how dangerous a person is. If that diagnosis is accurate enough for the court to take into account when deciding to send someone to prison, it should be accurate enough for the public to decide if someone is fit to be President.
1.3.2.1. Con: The [APA's ethics committee](https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2017.4a27) has dismissed the idea that the use of psychiatry in forensic and legal proceedings invalidates the rule. Psychiatric opinions in such cases are valid as they are offered under a court’s authorization and dissemination of the gathered information is controlled.
1.3.3. Con: This is an argument to require a [high threshold](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171205115957.htm) before commenting on Trump's mental health, not an argument for placing a complete gag order on all psychiatrists.
1.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.4. Pro: These psychiatric evaluations and comments are also based on information that may be biased through the media, sensationalized to attract audiences or edited for PR purposes. In any case; it is not fit for a [psychiatric diagnosis](https://www.healio.com/psychiatry/practice-management/news/online/%7Bc245c84f-e822-4e9e-bca4-e15774571e95%7D/debating-the-goldwater-rule-should-psychiatrists-weigh-in-on-trump?page=3).
1.3.4.1. Pro: No psychiatrist can learn enough from observing someone in public to make a diagnosis. It is integral for people to talk with their psychiatrist one on one before being diagnosed, in order to ensure relevant facts are relayed without being twisted by media on either side of the political spectrum.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.2.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.3.
1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.2.2.
1.3.6. Pro: In the years following the defeat of [Barry Goldwater](https://www.lawfareblog.com/psychiatrists-goldwater-rule-trump-era) in the United States' elections, it became clear to everyone who knew him that Goldwater was neither mentally ill nor suffering from major psychoses, as diagnosed by America’s leading psychiatrists.
1.3.7. Pro: The [focus](http://jaapl.org/content/45/2/228?ijkey=36c915059c4a0a331e88899f270bdb887233ff89&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) of these psychiatrists' comments is real people who can be negatively impacted by poorly grounded, inaccurate speculation about their mental condition. Hence as long as there is a possibility of an incorrect diagnosis or comment; it should still be prevented for the sake of these people's well being.
1.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.3.1.1.
1.3.9. Con: -> See 1.1.10.
1.3.10. Con: Patients are [rarely forthcoming](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201110/the-essential-guide-defense-mechanisms) about personal information at the best of times, they use a number of techniques to avoid doing that.
1.3.11. Con: Psychiatrists, in support of the Goldwater Rule, have stated that it [does not disallow them](http://jaapl.org/content/44/2/226.long) from diagnosing non-American public figures. This implies that these psychiatrists do believe that they have enough information to make an accurate diagnosis in such cases. Hence they should naturally be able to accurately diagnose American public figures as well, especially considering that much more information is available regarding the latter.
1.3.12. Pro: [Long range](http://www.rudge.tv/diagnosis-at-a-distance/) [diagnosis](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/30/diagnosed-donald-trump-goldwater-rule-mental-health) is both inaccurate and [unethical](https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2017/jul/28/the-goldwater-rule-why-commenting-on-mental-health-from-a-distance-is-unhelpful). The only ethical and certain way would be an actual, proper psychological analysis and evaluation.
1.3.13. Pro: The Goldwater Rule represents an important [principle](http://web.stanford.edu/class/siw198q/websites/reprotech/New%20Ways%20of%20Making%20Babies/EthicVoc.htm) in medicine, that doctors should only work within the limits of their immediate knowledge. For this reason it should remain.
1.3.13.1. Pro: This principle is represented in areas outside the USA and psychiatry - recently in the Charlie Gard case in the UK, a judge ruled that doctors [should not give evidence on a case without personally having examined the patient](https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/great-ormond-street-hospital-v-yates-and-gard-24-july-2017/).
1.3.13.1.1. Con: The Charlie Gard case is completely different to the case of Trump. Unlike in the Gard case, there exist a whole host of tweets and videos that provide us with a deep insight into the mind of Donald Trump. Psychiatrists who speak about his mental state have evidence to base these claims on.
1.3.14. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.
1.4. Pro: The Goldwater rule unnecessarily silences psychiatrists and restricts their [freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech) and ability to contribute to public discussion of mental health.
1.4.1. Con: Regardless of whether the Goldwater rule is imposed or not, [psychiatrists](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/30/diagnosed-donald-trump-goldwater-rule-mental-health) should refrain from commenting on the health of celebrities and public figures. Such speculations are likely to be facile and empty generalisations rather than divulging real professional inside information. As a consequence the public's perspective of psychiatrists as esteemed authoritative figures is likely to be damaged.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Mental health professionals who ignore the Goldwater Rule and remotely observe Trump often are [analysing](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/diagnosing-donald-trump) what we all see; lack of empathy, aggression, his lies and contradictory statements. This does not require specialised knowledge to recognise such traits, and does not promote their credibility or authority.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Professional comments on a political figure often [follow](http://jaapl.org/content/45/2/228?ijkey=36c915059c4a0a331e88899f270bdb887233ff89&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) the political preferences of the concerned psychiatrists. Keeping this in mind, it is very likely for these psychiatrists to have compromised judgment and for their diagnosis to vary.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Any psychiatrists who would do this would likely be doing so for their own benefit: creating a non-scientific diagnoses to fit both their own belief system according to their own political leaning and to get TV time. There would be almost zero upside to this practice and a great deal of likely pitfalls.
1.4.1.2.2. Pro: [Herbert Sacks](https://www.invantageadvising.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Ethics-of-APAs-Goldwater-Rule-by-Kroll-Pounce.pdf), a former president of the APA, defended the organization's position on the Goldwater rule by pointing out that often psychiatrists have demonstrated their own political partisanship when commenting on the mental health of key political figures.
1.4.1.2.3. Pro: A substantial majority of psychologists are [politically liberal](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-social-science-politically-biased/). The Goldwater Rule helps diminish the risk of liberal biases against conservative politicians.
1.4.1.2.3.1. Pro: The [book](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-op-0117-goldwater-rule-20180116-story.html) written on Trump's mental health includes a lot of left-wing criticism of his positions and the admission by a few authors that psychiatry is a “liberal” profession. Thus it is evident that many of these opinions are influenced by the psychiatrists' personal political opinions.
1.4.2. Pro: The Goldwater Rule may have been relevant at the time of implementation, but now that social media allows anyone to share opinions \(e.g. on the mental health of public figures\) freely, professional opinion is needed now, more than ever.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Considering how [emotionally charged](https://www.thecut.com/2017/07/its-time-to-retire-the-goldwater-rule.html) the debate over Trump's strange and offensive behavior has been, it can be very helpful to have professional voices become part of the dialogue and help filter out baseless claims.
1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.
1.4.4. Con: Without proper evaluation and examination there is only limited evidence \(the opiner's observations of public behavior\). Therefore, no opinion should be rendered without clear disclaimers that the psychiatrist or psychologist giving it is stating their opinion. Further such opinions are most properly hedged as "exhibits the traits of ____".
1.4.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.4.5. Pro: The Goldwater Rule reinforces the [divide](https://www.bustle.com/p/why-the-goldwater-rule-is-being-upheld-even-in-the-trump-era-72642) between physical health and mental health, considering that professionals are allowed to comment on one and not the other. It furthers the narrative that physical health should be prioritized over mental health.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Physical medicine doctors frequently make statistical statements backed by research: "exposure to this chemical results in a 60% greater incidence of cancer" for example. No one believes that to be delivering a diagnosis. Similar statistical statements can be presented in the context of a public person's behavior without making a diagnosis.
1.4.6. Pro: The Goldwater rule was an excessive response, [implemented](https://www.thecut.com/2017/07/its-time-to-retire-the-goldwater-rule.html) in response to some psychiatrists who participated in a survey using extremely derogatory language towards Barry Goldwater, in which they compared him to Hitler, amongst other things. This event provided no value and is very different to psychiatrists providing useful and honest commentary.
1.4.7. Con: The APA has a responsibility to uphold a [positive image of psychiatry](https://www.invantageadvising.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Ethics-of-APAs-Goldwater-Rule-by-Kroll-Pounce.pdf). Psychiatrists who form diagnosis without proper investigation can give inaccurate verdicts and can contradict each other. This can tarnish the reputation of the profession and hence the APA has a responsibility to enforce the Goldwater Rule.
1.4.8. Con: The APA, as the professional organization representing the psychiatric profession, has the right to establish ethics standards and rules of behavior for its members that may be more stringent or restrictive than the rights allowed by the First Amendment \(The Ethics of APA’s Goldwater Rule, [pg.3](http://mehr.tums.ac.ir/Upload/Journal/aeb43ca5-e5cf-4d4a-b7a4-7c1b36f30984.pdf)\).
1.4.8.1. Pro: The public generally assumes that psychiatrists hold a special role in society as experts in human motivation and behavior which carries a degree of credibility and knowledge above that attributed to ordinary citizens or professionals from other fields. Because of this presumed expertise, authority is given to the statements of psychiatrists, even when they are acting in the capacity of private citizens \(The Ethics of APA’s Goldwater Rule, [pg.3](http://mehr.tums.ac.ir/Upload/Journal/aeb43ca5-e5cf-4d4a-b7a4-7c1b36f30984.pdf)\).
1.4.8.1.1. Pro: Even when they are acting in the capacity of private citizens, authority is perceived in the statements of psychiatrists.
1.4.8.2. Pro: According to [Section 7.2](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/Ethics/principles-medical-ethics.pdf) of The APA's Principles of Medical Ethics: “Psychiatrists shall always be mindful of their separate roles as dedicated citizens and as experts in psychological medicine”.
1.4.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.1.4.
1.4.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.
1.4.9. Pro: Psychiatrists are highly educated individuals who are perfectly able to [decide](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2017/07/psychiatrists_shouldn_t_have_to_follow_the_goldwater_rule.html) for themselves whether to contribute their hard earned knowledge to the public. The Goldwater Rule is yet another nanny state law put in place to have more control over the public and limit their access to knowledge.
1.4.10. Con: The Goldwater rule should remain. Psychiatrists are powerful figures who in the past have diagnosed people as mentally ill for [transgressing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9566.2005.00444.x) social norms or [behaving badly](https://www.madinamerica.com/2012/02/why-anti-authoritarians-are-diagnosed-as-mentally-ill/), such as conscientious objectors, women who became pregnant outside of marriage and children diagnosed with ADHD.
1.4.11. Con: The [APA's ethics committee](https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2017.4a27) states that the Goldwater Rule does not infringe on the psychiatrists' freedom of speech. It states that psychiatrists as citizens may offer opinions. They may observe the behavior and work of a public figure and support, oppose or critique their actions. But the psychiatrist may not assume a professional role in voicing that critique in the form of a professional opinion due to lack of consent or other authorization.
1.4.11.1. Con: -> See 1.4.8.1.
1.4.12. Con: Removing the Goldwater rule may generate a temptation amongst psychiatrists to engage in sensationalist diagnoses in the media as a means of gaining publicity, at the cost of public confidence in political figures.
1.4.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.4.13. Con: Nobody, including Trump, should be diagnosed without their consent.
1.4.13.1. Con: Some mentally ill people are unaware that they are ill or require help. In these cases, when people are a [possible danger to themselves and others](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-psychopath-psychosis-mental-health-danger-us-president-goldwater-rule-psychiatrist-a8084726.html), their consent is not needed. Trump may well be one of these people.
1.4.13.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.
1.4.13.1.2. Pro: Considering that Trump may be completely unaware of this own mental illness, it is very important for psychiatrists to be allowed to comment on his mental health. This makes it likelier that he will be pressured into seeking the psychiatrists help that he may be in need of.
1.4.13.1.3. Con: In case a person is unable to give consent, the [family](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3725243/) of the person gives the consent on their behalf. No member of Trump's family will do that.
1.4.13.2. Pro: Making a diagnosis without the patient's consent \(no matter who the patient in question is\) is unethical, undermining the strict confidential doctor-patient relationship.
1.4.13.2.1. Pro: [Doctor-patient confidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician%E2%80%93patient_privilege) is key to protecting patients' trust and willingness to speak freely to their healthcare provider.
1.4.13.2.2. Con: Openly diagnosing a public figure is different from revealing confidential information about a patient, as there exists no psychiatrist-patient relationship in the former situation.
1.4.13.2.2.1. Pro: Psychiatrists are only openly diagnosing Trump with the [primary aim](https://reason.com/archives/2018/05/01/the-myth-of-donald-trumps-ment) of making the public more aware as they are an active stakeholder. This does not apply to other patients at all.
1.4.13.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.4.
1.4.13.2.2.3. Pro: Psychiatrists who "diagnose" Trump would likely be speaking on the basis of publicly observable and therefore non-privileged information. In this case, they would not be subject to confidentiality obligations.
1.4.13.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.2.1.
1.4.13.3. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.4.13.4. Pro: Diagnosis without consent is harmful, especially if it is a misdiagnosis, which is likely through [remote diagnosis](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/30/diagnosed-donald-trump-goldwater-rule-mental-health).
1.4.13.4.1. Pro: A dire prognosis based on little evidence can highlight weakness and can negatively impact the patient's [self-concept](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-08-mental-health-good.html). Self-concept is the image of how one sees themselves and their perception of their own abilities, behaviour and unique characteristics.
1.4.13.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.4.13.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.4.13.5. Pro: A diagnosis without consent could potentially lead to the [deterioration](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-08-mental-health-good.html) of the patient's mental health, without them even asking for a diagnosis in the first place.
1.4.13.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.
1.4.13.5.2. Pro: Placing the label of a mental health condition on a patient can turn into a [self-fulfilling prophecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy), especially if it triggers anxiety or depression. Because receiving a diagnosis involves accepting this risk, it is wrong to diagnosis a patient without their consent.
1.4.13.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.13.4.1.
1.4.13.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.
1.4.13.7. Con: Trump requested [a test of his cognitive health](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/16/health/montreal-cognitive-assessment-mental-health-trump/index.html), which he completed and publicly discussed. In doing so, he has implicitly approved of public commentary on his mental health.
1.4.13.7.1. Con: Trump took a test to prove to the public he is mentally fit. This does not mean he wants or approves of continuing commentary on his mental health. He released the results to put an end to the public discourse.
1.4.13.7.2. Con: By publicly discussing the test of his cognitive health, he allowed the discussion about that one test. The permission might not include other aspects of mental or physical health.
1.4.13.7.3. Pro: The presidential physician [explained](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/what-s-mental-test-trump-took-n838176) the results of the assessment and declared that he believed Trump was fit for office. It is only fair for other professionals to publicly disagree with his findings, if they so choose.
1.4.13.7.3.1. Con: Other doctors haven't conducted a proper examination of Trump and as such are not able to dispute results. They do not have reliable data to diagnose Trump. Any possible symptoms and/or disorders that can be found in a public image of Trump may not be reflected in the true state of his mental health.
1.4.13.7.3.2. Pro: Psychiatry is known for frequently being [imprecise](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/31/psychiatry-psychosis-schizophrenia-drug-treatments) and different doctors having vastly different diagnoses. Another doctor may well have certified Trump as unfit.
1.4.13.7.3.2.1. Con: This can be said about any diagnosis. Adopting this kind of doubt without any evidences can lead to invalidating every previous or future diagnosis, as there is no reason to believe that the 2nd or n'th diagnosis will be the correct one.
1.4.13.7.4. Pro: Trump simply took a cognitive screening test for memory loss or early dementia - the [Montreal Cognitive Assessment](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/16/16899150/trump-montreal-cognitive-assement-ronny-jackson) - and used it to declare his general mental fitness. The false equivalency Trump has created between the test he took and the complete mental fitness he declared needs to be disputed.
1.4.13.7.4.1. Pro: [According to the neurologist](https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/how-an-immigrant-to-canada-helped-donald-trump-prove-his-mental-health) who designed the test, the test is designed to only identify early cognitive decline, not other psychological issues, or personality attributes, such as judgment.
1.4.13.8. Con: Psychiatrists frequently diagnose patients [without their consent](https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/apa/65479) -- when people are brought into the emergency room by paramedics or police, for instance.
1.4.13.8.1. Con: In order to diagnose a patient without their consent, the psychiatrists need to first establish that the patient has an '[Incapacity to give informed consent](https://jme.bmj.com/content/29/1/41)'. The conditions for this are the patient being unable to choose, unable to understand the need or being unable to communicate their consent. Considering this evaluation has not been conducted with regards to Trump, the exception should not apply to him.
1.4.14. Pro: Psychiatrists can comment on public figures and make informed inferences based on the publicly available information without officially diagnosing them. This commentary can be accompanied by the disclaimer that without evaluating a patient in person, an official diagnosis isn’t possible. Disallowing all sorts of comments is an excessive restriction on their freedom of speech.
1.4.14.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.8.
1.4.14.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.4.14.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.
1.4.15. Pro: People from other professions are allowed to comment on public figures and events related to their field. Psychiatrists should also be allowed the same freedom.
1.4.15.1. Pro: The American Psychological Association does not have a Goldwater Rule so psychologists can comment on public figures.
1.4.15.1.1. Con: In response to a New York Times op-ed by a psychiatrist who had criticized mental health professionals for armchair diagnoses of political candidates, the then-president of the American Psychological Association wrote in [a published letter](http://www.apa.org/news/press/response/presidential-candidates.aspx) in the same newspaper that similar to the psychiatrists' Goldwater Rule, their ethical code states that psychologists should not offer a diagnosis in the media of a living public figure they have not examined.
1.4.15.1.2. Pro: The area of expertise of psychologists is [very different](https://www.allpsychologyschools.com/psychology/psychology-vs-psychiatry/) to that of psychiatrists \(who are also medical doctors\).
1.4.15.2. Pro: Restraining psychiatrists from speaking about a President based on publicly available information is like [telling](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/will-trump-be-the-death-of-the-goldwater-rule) economists not to speak about the economy, or keeping lawyers from commenting on legal cases in the public eye.
1.4.15.2.1. Con: Issues of the economy and legal cases are far more publicly transparent than the mental health of public figures, especially considering the commonality of public personas.
1.4.15.2.2. Con: Psychiatrists publicly commenting on a candidate's mental health can have implications as consequential as changing the outcomes of elections. However, allowing professionals from other fields to publicly speak about their area of expertise is unlikely to have such significant implications.
1.4.15.2.2.1. Con: Economists, policy experts, and journalists can also significantly influence the electorate's perspective of a candidate.
1.4.15.2.2.2. Con: The Goldwater Rule does not apply to psychologists and hence they are still allowed to comment on the mental health of politicians. However, these comments have not had a significant impact on the outcome of elections.
1.4.15.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.15.1.
1.4.15.2.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.15.1.2.
1.4.15.2.2.3. Con: Discussion surrounding Trump's health was ongoing [before](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/donald-trump-narcissism-therapists) he was elected. Psychiatrists still diagnosed him and gave their opinions on his health, yet this did little to prevent him from becoming President.
1.4.15.2.2.3.1. Con: The fact that such commentary was not decisive in Trump's election does not preclude it from being decisive in future elections.
1.4.15.2.2.3.2. Con: Public comments by psychiatrists may have persuaded individual voters, even if it did not persuade the majority of voters. That is still important as voters should be able to vote based on a full set of information about the candidates.
1.4.15.2.2.3.3. Pro: Trump's erratic behavior and compromised judgment have been obvious since his candidacy. Hence the public was already aware of his behavior patterns and he still won. Psychiatrists have themselves stated that the way to get Trump out of office is not [psychological, but political](https://gizmodo.com/american-psychoanalytic-association-says-its-members-ar-1797247879).
1.4.15.2.2.3.3.1. Con: If the public is aware of Trump's mental state and still decides to elect him then that is an informed decision. Psychiatrists should not be concerned with ensuring that someone does not come into power, they should try to empower the public with the knowledge they require to make an informed choice.
1.4.15.2.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.1.
1.4.15.2.2.5. Pro: [In 1972](https://www.npr.org/2012/08/04/157670201/the-thomas-eagleton-affair-haunts-candidates-today), when the public learned that Democratic vice presidential nominee Tom Eagleton had been hospitalized for depression, he was forced to quit the race. Presidential candidate George McGovern spoke to Eagleton's psychiatrists and based on those conversations, made the decision that Eagleton was too much of a risk to have his finger potentially on the metaphorical button.
1.4.15.2.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.1.8.
1.4.15.3. Con: -> See 1.4.10.
1.4.15.4. Con: -> See 1.4.15.2.2.
1.4.15.5. Con: A politician who is diagnosed might lash out at psychiatrists. This could turn the politician's supporters against psychiatry and mental health treatment.
1.4.15.6. Pro: Doctors frequently offer opinions on the health of public figures, [including presidential candidates](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/us/politics/hillary-clinton-health.html), based on what they observe.
1.4.16. Pro: It is absurd to discriminate against freedom of speech on the grounds that one's opinion is too well informed.
1.4.16.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.15.2.
1.4.16.2. Con: Because of their authoritative reputation, any inaccurate diagnosis of Trump by a psychiatrist could potentially create unnecessary concern among the public.
1.4.16.3. Pro: It is wrong that qualified psychiatrists are banned from providing the public important perspective on mental health when claims about Trump’s mental health have been made by different groups of people, which are often false and present a wrong image of people with mental illnesses. Psychiatrists should be allowed to offer their perspective, especially if they have to correct the record.
1.4.16.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.4.16.3.2. Pro: Public conversations about mental health by professionals might create discussion trends that are more nuanced and less stigmatizing than the commentary that already exists among the public and in the media.
1.4.16.3.2.1. Pro: Trump has made [numerous comments](https://namimc.org/nut-job-wacko-basket-case-how-donald-trumps-put-downs-may-impact-mental-health-stigma/) which stigmatize mental health, contributing to a negatively-framed national dialogue on the issue.
1.4.16.3.2.2. Con: Psychiatrists or any other "experts" on the panels of news shows usually do not have the ability to control the way in which their remarks or analysis are framed.
1.4.16.3.2.3. Con: Professional commentary on Trump's mental health might lend credibility and institutional legitimacy to any stigmatizing remarks that occur.
1.4.16.3.2.3.1. Pro: [Only powerful social groups](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5347358/) can create stigma.
1.4.16.3.2.4. Con: The media would likely capitalize on any psychiatric diagnosis, regardless of the attitudes of the psychiatrist, simplifying the diagnosis in order to write catchy headlines, etc.
1.4.16.3.2.5. Pro: A [significant number of psychiatrists](https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/apa/65479) would like to have the Goldwater Rule removed. These are people willing to contribute to the discussion on mental health. Once these psychiatrists are allowed to contribute in an unrestricted manner, it will allow for an influx of intelligent, well- informed opinions and facts in the mental health discussion. Ultimately, this will contribute to building less stigmatizing narratives surrounding mental health.
1.4.16.3.3. Pro: The discussion on Trump's mental health is already very public and should be balanced, hearing both sides of the story. Psychiatrists who believe Trump has no serious mental health problems should also be encouraged to contribute their opinion. If the Goldwater rule is preventing a fair discussion it should be removed.
1.4.16.3.4. Pro: Given that the nature of the [media](http://jaapl.org/content/45/2/228?ijkey=36c915059c4a0a331e88899f270bdb887233ff89&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) is to primarily attract the audience and that the mental health of a candidate is a very popular topic, the media is likely to opt for any opinions on an influential leader, regardless of the credentials of the person offering them. Hence if psychiatrists choose not to comment, the media is very likely to have other people with much less expertise speak on a very sensitive topic.
1.4.16.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.4.16.3.6. Pro: Media outlets in the US and Europe \(TV and print\) spent a [significant percentage](https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/getFile.aspx?Id=1590) of their coverage of Trump discussing his "fitness for office" \(including directly questioning his mental health\).
1.4.16.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.1.4.
1.4.16.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.15.
1.5. Con: Public diagnosis of Trump's mental health will only serve to stigmatise mental health.
1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.16.3.2.
1.5.2. Pro: Not only does a public diagnosis [stigmatise](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/30/diagnosed-donald-trump-goldwater-rule-mental-health) Trump and affect his reputation, it will also impact people who have been diagnosed with similar conditions. Such people will have to contend with negative portrayals of their illness in the media and may make self-comparisons with Trump, which would be damaging on a number of levels.
1.5.3. Con: Discussion of Trump's mental health will continue even without professional diagnosis, meaning that stigmatizing and insensitive dialogue is likely to occur regardless.
1.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.16.3.2.3.
1.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.16.3.6.
1.5.4. Pro: People with mental illnesses may not want to try running for public office or pursue career paths that invite media scrutiny due to this.
1.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.1.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.16.3.2.3.
1.5.6. Con: Not publicly diagnosing public figures further stigmatizes mental health. The fact that the American Psychiatric Association thinks [it’s so terrible](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/07/24/the-ghost-of-barry-goldwater-and-the-censorship-of-american-psychiatrists/) to make psychiatric diagnoses of public figures shows that APA leaders themselves are discriminating against psychiatric illnesses because the assumption is that any psychiatric diagnosis will be harmful to the public figure. Instead of trying to fight society’s stigmatizing beliefs, the APA accepts them.
1.5.7. Con: -> See 1.4.5.
1.5.8. Con: Mental health has carried a [stigma](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/why-we-worry/201308/mental-health-stigma) in society long before Donald Trump entered the public sphere and will most likely continue after his time in office.  Although easy to scape goat, in this case Trump cannot personally vouch for stigmatising mental health.
1.5.9. Pro: Some of the professional commentary on Trump's mental health will be negative and stigmatizing.
1.5.9.1. Pro: Stigma against the mentally-ill among healthcare providers is [a major barrier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5347358/) to accessing treatment and care.
1.5.9.1.1. Pro: The absence of the Goldwater rule will promote a narrative that psychiatrists are prone to drawing conclusions on the basis of incomplete information. This can prompt people to [write off](http://jaapl.org/content/45/2/228?ijkey=36c915059c4a0a331e88899f270bdb887233ff89&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha) the value of psychiatric evaluation altogether.
1.5.9.2. Pro: Stigmatizing attitudes towards mental health are [common](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0020764011423176?journalCode=ispa) among mental healthcare professionals. These stigmatising attitudes are likely to colour their public comments about the mental health of public figures.
1.5.9.3. Pro: Professional commentary on Trump's mental health attributes his irresponsible behavior to a possible mental illness. This contributes to [the narrative](https://www.thecut.com/2017/07/its-time-to-retire-the-goldwater-rule.html) that people with mental illnesses are commonly destructive towards others and are unequipped to be in positions of power.
1.5.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.
1.5.9.3.2. Pro: According to [Allen Frances](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/opinion/an-eminent-psychiatrist-demurs-on-trumps-mental-state.html?_r=0), chairman of the task force that wrote the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, bad behavior is rarely a sign of mental illness, and the mentally ill rarely behave badly. It is therefore a stigmatizing insult to the mentally ill, who are mostly well behaved and well meaning, to be lumped with Trump, who is neither.
1.5.9.3.3. Pro: In the absence of the Goldwater rule, [political opponents](https://gizmodo.com/american-psychoanalytic-association-says-its-members-ar-1797247879) can weaponize someone's alleged mental health problems and use these to campaign against the individual.
1.5.10. Pro: This can result in Trump finding it harder to carry out his functions as President.
1.5.10.1. Con: Trump already faces public criticism of his mental health; additional commentary from psychiatrists now freed of the Goldwater rule is unlikely to be a significant barrier.
1.5.10.2. Con: Trump's [continued use](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/6/16857492/trump-tweets-mental-health) of inflammatory language on [Twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/politics/donald-trump-twitter-use-campaign-2016.html) may indicate he is not troubled by criticism of his mental health.
1.5.10.2.1. Pro: In January 2018, Trump [tweeted](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/6/16857492/trump-tweets-mental-health) that one of his greatest assets was his "mental stability," calling himself "a very stable genius."
1.5.11. Con: Discussing potential mental health problems of Trump in the media raises awareness and draws attention to the fact that many people are susceptible to mental illness, even those who seem to be at the highest levels of society. Such public dialogue allows for a more transparent and honest conversation about mental health in today's society.
1.5.11.1. Pro: People need to understand that mentally ill people [run the spectrum](https://www.theravive.com/today/post/a-spectrum-based-approach-to-mental-illness-and-wellness-0003204.aspx) from benign and unhappy, overly passive to violent, as opposed to the violence the [media likes to promote](https://bigthink.com/big-think-mental-health-channel/the-media-sells-the-mentally-ill-as-violent-criminals-truth-is-theyre-not).
1.5.11.2. Pro: A variety of different diagnosis is not necessarily unproductive. Some [psychiatrists](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/881006_3) believe that it is in line with the ethics of science, which supports a free discussion of competing hypotheses in a marketplace of ideas, with the confidence that through discourse the truth will emerge. Hence even if psychiatrists initially disagree, in the absence of the Goldwater rule, they are very likely to come up with the best diagnosis eventually.
1.6. Con: If psychiatrists end up giving various different diagnoses of Trump's mental health, or disagreeing on whether he is actually mentally ill or not, public confidence in the institution of psychiatry will be undermined.
1.6.1. Pro: There is already a lot of shame and social stigma attached to mental illnesses that stops people from [seeking help](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/i-hear-you/201710/10-reasons-why-people-refuse-talk-therapists) and [treatment](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/how-mental-health-stigma-stops-people-seeking-treatment/). A declining confidence in the institution of psychiatry will only make the process of getting help harder for people.
1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.1.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.
1.6.4. Pro: It is important that people approaching psychiatrists feel able to discuss their issues without fear of them being discussed outside the doctor's office. Seeing psychiatrists diagnose so publicly may make someone who needs help feel uncomfortable confiding in a psychiatrist.
1.6.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.13.2.2.
1.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.1.1.
1.6.4.3. Con: It is unlikely a patient would compare their own relationship with their psychiatrist to the public situation regarding psychiatrists and Trump.
1.6.4.3.1. Con: However if such patients are suffering from a Narcissistic personality disorder then they may well make comparisons between themselves and the President of the United States.
1.6.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.1.
1.6.4.5. Con: Psychiatrists are [bound](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/client-confidentiality) by patient confidentiality laws, and are not allowed to even reveal the fact that the patient is in therapy, much less any information about what has been discussed.
1.6.4.5.1. Con: Patients who are new to psychiatry and therefore hesitant to visit a psychiatrist are unlikely to be familiar with the institution's confidentiality laws.
1.6.5. Con: The field of psychiatry is not so fragile that scientific and reasonable discussion will ruin public confidence in it.
1.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.16.3.2.
1.6.6. Pro: Psychiatrists are already criticized as not ["real scientists"](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/is-psychology-a-e2809creale2809d-science-does-it-really-matter/) because their findings can be imprecise or varied. Disagreement on a public diagnosis would further discredit the scientific nature of the institution.
1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.5.11.2.
1.6.8. Con: If the actual uncensored opinions of practitioners of psychiatry will lead to the field being discredited, then the field should be discredited. It is not reasonable that the credibility of a scientific field relies on the public being censored from the practitioners expert views.
1.6.9. Pro: The [Sept-Oct 1964 issue of Fact magazine](http://jaapl.org/content/44/2/226.long) which initially published the survey evaluating Barry Goldwater's mental health offered the following results: 657 psychiatrists thought Goldwater was psychologically fit and 1189 thought otherwise. Considering the significant number of psychiatrists backing both opinions, the likelihood of psychiatrists disagreeing on a diagnosis is evident.
1.6.10. Pro: Given the polarised political culture in the US, any declaration by a psychiatrist about the mental well-being of a politician would be met with general suspicion and partisanship. This would only [shame](http://jaapl.org/content/44/3/407.2.long) the profession.
1.6.10.1. Pro: Allowing all psychiatrists to diagnose a public figure can set a dangerous precedent if used as a political tool. It can lead to political debates descending into uninformed discussions and personal attacks regarding which candidate is more mentally unstable.
1.6.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.6.10.1.2. Pro: [Allen Frances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Frances), who chaired the team that produced the fourth revision of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \(DSM-IV\), believes that [Trump is not mentally ill](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/opinion/an-eminent-psychiatrist-demurs-on-trumps-mental-state.html?_r=0) and psychiatric name-calling is a misguided way of countering Trump’s attack on democracy.
1.6.10.2. Pro: The Goldwater Rule is [intended](http://jaapl.org/content/44/3/407.2.long) to temper the potentially imprudent and self-indulgent motivations of psychiatrists to use the cloak of their profession to further a particular political ideology.
1.6.11. Con: In every profession there are differences of opinion. Psychiatry is no different and should not be judged on the basis of Trump's mental health.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.4.13.
1.8. Pro: By allowing psychiatrists to diagnose public figures, they can prevent dysfunctional and possibly dangerous individuals from being elected.
1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.8.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.1.1.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.4.15.2.2.3.
1.8.6. Con: -> See 1.4.10.
1.8.7. Pro: The President's mental health is just as important, perhaps more important, than any other aspect of her/his general health. The most powerful person in the world should be regularly monitored by the best health care professionals available.
1.8.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.8.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.15.2.2.5.
1.8.8. Con: Dysfunctional means an inability to fit into society or to behave consistently with social norms. If a person wins millions of votes then they must be able to navigate social norms, and if they obtain the highest office of political power, then they have clearly found an effective way of fitting in to society - so it isn't clear what it would mean to say they're dysfunctional.
1.8.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.7.
1.8.9. Con: The burden of preventing any mentally ill person from being elected is too broad and requires too much speculation for it to be a real responsibility of the psychiatric community.
1.8.9.1. Pro: Former president of the APA, Paul Summergrad, MD, psychiatrist-in-chief at Tufts University in Boston [said](https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/apa/65479), "I'm not sure any of us would want to have a new duty applied to us ... to scrub the behavior of all our political leaders such that ... we could be sued for breach of that duty. I'm not sure I want to have that liability."
1.8.9.1.1. Con: 'Duty' implies that psychiatrists always have to comment on a public figure's mental health. This will not be the case in the absence of the Goldwater Rule. Removing the Goldwater Rule simply means that psychiatrists would have the freedom to comment on the mental health of a public figure without fearing any negative consequences.
1.8.9.2. Pro: The task of evaluating the capability of a president ultimately rests in the political system and the legislature.
1.8.10. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.8.11. Pro: The American Medical Association's[Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs](http://www.aapl.org/expert-witness-testimony) policy states that a physician as a citizen and as a professional with special training and experience has an ethical obligation to assist with the administration of justice. In principle, this should be no different for psychiatrists.
1.8.12. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.9. Pro: Some psychiatrists are already commenting on the mental health of Trump. This leads to a [skewed debate](https://www.thecut.com/2017/07/its-time-to-retire-the-goldwater-rule.html) where only those who feel strongly about Trump - that he is a clear and present danger to the republic - participate in the public debate, and those who think otherwise refrain from commenting publicly. It is better to remove the Goldwater rule altogether and allow everyone to diagnose Trump, leading to a more intelligent discussion.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.16.3.
1.9.3. Pro: The fact that so many psychiatrists would like the Goldwater Rule to be [reconsidered](https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/apa/65479) speaks volumes. An unrestricted transparent discussion where top psychiatrists can weigh in with their true opinions and expertise would help the public to really understand the politics of their country.
1.9.4. Con: Sounds like we just need to strictly enforce the Goldwater rule, rather than turn it into a free-for-all of doctors throwing out a politically motivated diagnosis with very limited data on the subject.
1.9.5. Con: Allowing all psychiatrists to publicly comment on and diagnose Trump will further fuel the debate regarding his mental health. This is likely to distract from the more objective criticisms of his presidency.
1.9.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.1.
1.9.5.2. Con: Mental health is an objective criticism, and may be directly relevant to whether Trump has an effective presidency.
1.9.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.3.
1.9.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.9.5.3. Con: Allowing a diagnosis from those who medically understand the mind would help clear up this confusing conversation. Rather than fueling this debate it would put a lot of gossip and unqualified commentary to rest.
1.9.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.6.
1.9.5.4. Pro: Without guidelines, the public could be bombarded by different opinions and diagnosis from psychiatrists, which would have the opposite impact of a transparent and professional discussion and instead only confuse the public more.
1.9.6. Con: -> See 1.6.10.2.
