Discussion Title: Should There Be Trigger Warnings in Education?

1. Trigger warnings should be required in an educational setting.
1.1. Pro: Most students and educators want and support trigger warnings in their classrooms. This is reason enough to implement them.
1.1.1. Pro: An NBC survey revealed in 2016 that [61%](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Survey-College-Students-Support-Trigger-Warnings-Some-Fear-Speaking-Up-377613641.html) of students support trigger warnings.
1.1.1.1. Con: One survey alone is not strong enough to make an important decision that could significantly impact higher education.
1.1.2. Pro: The [voice](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/sep/11/how-can-universities-ensure-their-students-are-satisfied) of the student majority should be listened to by universities. Students play a key role in being involved with the development of education for future generations.
1.1.2.1. Con: If it is a majority, then they will because the majority is what funds the school. If it is a vocal minority demanding they need to balance. Until college in the US is free, they are responding to the majority.
1.1.3. Pro: In one [survey](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/09/07/492979242/half-of-professors-in-npr-ed-survey-have-used-trigger-warnings), over half of college professors said they had used trigger warnings, and 64.7% of that group did so of their own volition.
1.1.3.1. Con: If many college professors are using trigger warnings of their own volition, this suggests that there probably doesn't need to be a policy mandating them.
1.1.3.2. Con: The survey result is dubious. They claim ‘Our respondents were most likely to say they had used trigger warnings in reference to sexual or violent material. Racially, politically, or religiously charged topics were mentioned less often.’ But these topics would hardly ever even come up in many kinds of classes, such as STEM, business studies, etc
1.1.4. Con: It is in everyone's best interest that college students absorb a diverse range of ideas. Even if students want to be protected from exposure to some ideas, we shouldn't facilitate it. They will be better citizens after the broadest possible intellectual experience.
1.1.4.1. Con: The immediate [reaction](http://www.uncompromisingedu.com/2016/10/13/teaching-with-trigger-warnings/) to triggers can include extreme physical pain and an inability to partake in conversation or academic discourse. Hence not including trigger warnings is counterproductive. If you do not allow students to excuse themselves from certain discussions, they will still not be able to learn much while in class as they will be dealing with their emotional labor of sitting through the triggers.
1.1.5. Con: The prevailing narrative that students want and are campaigning for trigger warnings is false. According to a [study](http://ncac.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CN_123_FNL.pdf) by the National Coalition Against Censorship in the US 85% of faculty surveyed said they had never received a request from students to use trigger warnings. 92% said there was no student-initiated effort to require them at their school.
1.1.5.1. Pro: According to a [survey](http://ncac.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NCAC-TriggerWarningReport.pdf) conducted of over 800 educators from the Modern Language Association and the College Art Association; less than 20% of the respondents have students who have explicitly asked for trigger warnings.
1.1.5.2. Pro: [Many people](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/why-trigger-warnings-are-important) who refuse to include trigger warnings have not suffered from trauma themselves. They hence do not understand the struggles of a person who needs triggers warnings. Considering this, their decision to not impose trigger warnings should not be valid.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Whether you have PTSD or not, you can still have an informed opinion on the matter. Not all researchers and psychologists have PTSD, yet they have been involved in the development and maintenance of treatments for it. Words stand and fall on their own merit, not on the 'merit' of the people advocating the idea.
1.1.6. Con: Just because people support something doesn't mean it is necessarily in their best interest.
1.1.6.1. Con: While it's true that people don't always prefer what's in their best interest, except in instances where specialized knowledge is required, they are better positioned to know their own self-interest than others.
1.1.6.1.1. Pro: A core [argument](https://facedownphilosophy.com/2012/11/13/j-s-mills-on-liberty-the-case-against-paternalism/) against paternalism is that rationally self-interested are best-positioned to know their own good and what is most likely to help obtain it.
1.1.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.1.6.2. Pro: People will often [support](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/upshot/why-americans-vote-against-their-interest-partisanship.html) policies that directly go against their own interests.
1.1.7. Pro: The inclusion of trigger warnings signifies [solidarity and empathy](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/triggerwarning) for people suffering from mental illnesses. It shows them that a university is willing to make adjustments to accommodate their needs. Hence if mentally ill people demand trigger warnings, that should be reason enough to provide them.
1.1.7.1. Pro: When a university uses trigger warnings, it explicitly shows that it is aware of the sufferings of mentally ill people. Hence trigger warnings make it likelier for people to [come out](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/coming-out-about-mental-illness#1) about their mental illnesses since they will be encouraged by the support exhibited by their universities.
1.1.8. Con: It may only seem so because it is only them that speak out or complain. Those content with/preferable to the status quo are unlikely to speak out or complain.
1.2. Pro: The inclusion of trigger warnings on syllabi is a good alternative to outright censorship.
1.2.1. Con: As there need not be either censorship or trigger warnings, this sets up a false dichotomy and is not a defence of the inclusion of trigger warnings.
1.2.2. Con: Even if trigger warnings don't lead to outright censorship, by providing them, many students will opt out and this will [reduce the diversity of opinions](https://record.goshen.edu/2016/09/32971-do-we-need-safe-spaces-and-trigger-warnings) that can be aired during a discussion.
1.2.2.1. Con: Trigger warnings allow people to opt out of discussions they didn't feel they could participate in anyway. Therefore, forcing people into those conversations does not add any perspectives.
1.2.3. Pro: Rather than extreme censorship of whole topics perceived as difficult for students, trigger warnings are a good compromise since many challenging subjects are integral for University courses.
1.2.3.1. Con: When reading world literature, students should not be "shielded" from its contents. It can lead to a lessening of cultural awareness, and thus cultural decay.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.2.4. Pro: The idea of trigger warnings has been around since the [1960s](https://medium.com/the-vocal/a-history-of-trigger-warnings-and-the-price-and-diversity-of-pain-ac8e796d0d70), and yet it has had no effect on censorship or free speech.
1.2.4.1. Con: While giving appropriate notice of difficult content under the discretion of an educator is not unprecedented, the [systematic](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-28/monash-university-adopts-trigger-warning-policy/8390264)  use of trigger warnings through formal university policy is a relatively new development in education.
1.2.4.2. Con: The linked article notes that trigger warnings have experienced an explosion in popularity in recent years.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: There are numerous reasons why trigger warnings have become more mainstream in recent years.
1.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Such a reason could be increased awareness of mental health issues.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: The absence of trigger warnings could be very damaging to their mental health and wellbeing.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Without trigger warnings, students who have had traumatic experiences and suffer from mental illnesses, will most likely be stripped of any sense of security they may have developed. They are likely to feel [weak, powerless and ignored](http://portagenorthernlight.com/4480/opinion/trigger-warnings-procon/) knowing that content, which may trigger their PTSD, can be hurled at them at any point in a class.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Triggering events for those with PTSD can be so [individual and specific](https://www.thenation.com/article/feminists-talk-trigger-warnings-round/) that they cannot be anticipated and warned against.  Trigger warnings will therefore do little to help those genuinely suffering from PTSD.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Trigger warnings operate on numerous assumptions about the receiver as well as the content without acknowledging that being triggered is [profoundly subjective](https://mic.com/articles/87283/9-feminist-arguments-against-using-trigger-warnings-in-academia#.KwB51GcK5).
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Research](https://www.nap.edu/read/11955/chapter/1#ii) shows that trigger warnings actually reinforce PTSD. The way to combat PTSD is not through avoidance of the painful past but actually through exposure therapy, where patients confront their trauma through memories. Therefore if PTSD students avoid certain topics because of their past, they might not be helping themselves.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The research shared is a review of the literature regarding treatment of PTSD and contains no mention of trigger warnings, let alone any support for the claim that trigger warnings reinforce PTSD.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The research shared states that there was sufficient evidence \(between 1980 and 2008, when the text was published\) to suggest that "exposure therapies" are effective in treating PTSD, but the given description greatly oversimplifies this treatment. Exposure to stressors in a learning environment is certainly not comparable to this therapy.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.3. Con: "Trigger warnings are countertherapeutic because they encourage avoidance of reminders of trauma, and avoidance maintains P.T.S.D." [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/09/13/do-trigger-warnings-work/if-you-need-a-trigger-warning-you-need-ptsd-treatment)
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Evidence [suggests](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1586/ern.11.94) that prolonged exposure to reminders of traumatic events is an effective treatment for PTSD.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Exposure therapy can be regarded as a[cruel and unethical](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229094059_The_Cruelest_Cure_Ethical_Issues_in_the_Implementation_of_Exposure-Based_Treatments) form of treatment, due to the intense fear that can be generated during an exposure.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.3.2. Con: In [many cases](https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/191276/Horton_umn_0130M_18477.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), faculty members who practice trigger warnings do not allow students to skip lectures or readings. The purpose is to warn the students regarding the sensitive content. In these cases, students are not avoiding the trauma but are simply [more equipped](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/09/07/492979242/half-of-professors-in-npr-ed-survey-have-used-trigger-warnings) to deal with it.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: In many cases, the main aim of trigger warnings is to ensure that students are ready to switch on whatever [coping strategies](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/jun/14/i-use-trigger-warnings-but-im-not-mollycoddling-my-students) they have developed.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.4. Con: There is no extant [evidence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/talking-about-men/201703/trigger-warnings-and-mental-health-where-is-the-evidence) that trigger warnings have any positive effect on short or long term mental health outcomes.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5. Con: The absence of trigger warnings better prepares students for the real world, where there are no trigger warnings.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.1. Pro: For one to receive a proper education, one must understand that he or she may not like or agree with the information being offered. So is life. Take subjects like history, social studies, sociology, psychology, natural sciences, and the likes always offer differing ideas than what one may commonly believe. Truth is, the world doesn’t care if one is, “triggered,” what is, is what is. The earlier someone learns that important lesson, the better.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.2. Con: It is not true that in the real world there are no trigger warnings-[classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture_content_rating_system) and content warnings have been used to great effect in the film and television industries for many years.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.2.1. Pro: Trigger warnings are present in most forms of discourse - from meeting agendas at work to MPAA ratings at theaters. Even open internet and Twitter searches give you results that generally can be anticipated by your query with search engines filtering out any outliers. It benefits students to be confronted with issues in school in a manner similar to how they will confront them in other common scenarios.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.2.2. Con: Board meetings, movies and social media are not real life. Real life is manual labor, being in public, spending time with your friends without thinking about trigger warnings, etc. None of those lend themselves well to being slapped with trigger warnings. That is why they aren't. Real life does not have them.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.2.2.1. Con: Defining real life in a way that includes the fact that you're doing things "without thinking about trigger warnings" creates a circular argument. Showing that trigger warnings are not part of real life than becomes trivially true: true by definition but not actually showing anything.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.2.3. Pro: [Content warnings](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/09/13/do-trigger-warnings-work/trust-me-trigger-warnings-are-helpful) warning people regarding the contents of movies etc have always been around and people have not objected to those. A variation of trigger warnings hence already exists. Trigger warnings aren't censorship. Nothing about the trigger warning changes content, the only thing they do is give people fair warning.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.3. Pro: We don't live in a world where individual feelings matter. As an adult, we deal with difficult multifaceted issues and people need to cope with reality. Life is hard and individuals need to have the strength to rise to the challenge. A little adversity is a positive thing.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.6. Con: Trigger warnings increase peoples' perceived emotional vulnerability to trauma. [Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbtep.2018.07.002)
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.7. Con: Trigger warnings may inadvertently undermine some aspects of emotional resilience. [Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbtep.2018.07.002)
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.8. Pro: Many students at the University of Chicago have been very [upset and concerned](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/08/30/so-you-like-the-university-of-chicagos-rejection-of-safe-spaces-for-students-consider-this/) by their university’s refusal to implement trigger warnings.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.8.1. Con: Students should not be allowed to dictate how a professor teaches their class.
1.2.4.2.1.1.1.9. Pro: Patients with depression, PTSD, and other mental illnesses often go through extensive therapy and treatments in order to be able to return to their mainstream lifestyles and partake in things like university experiences. It would hence be unfair to not warn them of aspects that may cause them to [relapse](https://thoughtcatalog.com/nina-rodriguez/2017/10/this-is-how-trigger-warnings-can-help-battle-mental-health-issues/); especially when they have had to work harder than other individuals to reach these institutions.
1.2.5. Pro: If a trigger warning is simply a quick summary of the material in question, it seems reasonable to provide a quick summary for simple pedagogical reasons in the first place.
1.2.5.1. Con: A summary should not include any subjective analysis of the material, as is required for a trigger warning.
1.2.6. Pro: Alternatives allow adequate decisions to be made by education departments broadly, and schools individually. Not all student bodies share the same backgrounds and needs.
1.3. Con: Trigger warnings might create a false sense of security, as there is no way for the lecturer to guarantee that no student will make a comment or question involving sensitive topics.
1.3.1. Pro: This false sense of security can expand out into the real world as students leave school unprepared to face questions or comments that are particularly triggering.
1.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.
1.3.2. Con: If there is a trigger warning on a specific course or lecture, then students should expect discussion of sensitive materials during that course. If students are uncomfortable with that, they can leave or not sign up in the first place.
1.3.2.1. Con: The role of education is to expose students to new ideas. Otherwise you get stuck in a bubble. Getting an education should be, in itself, a trigger warning. In recognizing that, each institution should have a program for students and faculty in learning how to deal with triggers.
1.3.3. Pro: Students can work out if a subject may be triggering for them. Advertising it is not helpful. Providing a safe and supportive environment to work through the trigger is more important than advertising the potential and doing nothing to help. Mental health care is more than signposting difficult stuff, and by encountering difficult stuff, positive improvements are made. Providing trigger warnings allows the student AND the establishment to abdicate responsibility for care.
1.3.4. Pro: The widespread [backlash](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2014/05/29/essay-faculty-members-about-why-they-will-not-use-trigger-warnings) against trigger warnings from certain academics indicates that even if trigger warnings are nominally in place, lecturers may be uninterested in policing classroom discussion around topics identified as triggering.
1.4. Con: Trigger warnings allow people to ignore opinions they don't like.  This is counterproductive to civil discourse.
1.4.1. Pro: Trigger warning has the connotation that the presented material is less accurate or important
1.4.1.1. Con: There is no reason to believe that students would take material with a trigger warning to be less accurate or important. One could just as easily argue that by including material on the syllabus despite its being sensitive, that the instructor is communicating how important that material is.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Trigger warnings are used by the political left. They indicate that material is offensive to groups/people who are left leaning. The political signaling is where the connotation of accuracy and importance originates.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Despite the [prevailing media narrative](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trigger-warning-survey_us_565dc81fe4b08e945fec965c) that trigger warnings are a tool of the political left, the reality of trigger warnings is that they are requested by students from across the political spectrum, especially religious students.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: Physical trigger warnings have existed for years and not "used by the left" - an example is the ratings of films, food allergens etc
1.4.2. Pro: Trigger warnings give students the opportunity to walk out of classes if they know that material which they disagree with is going to be mentioned. As a result, they will not have the opportunity to listen to or engage with a diverse set of ideas.
1.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.4.2.2. Pro: It's not illegal for anyone to limit their own education as they see fit, it would merely be reflected in their educational qualifications by the end of it. For example: a biologist who walked out every time the theory of evolution and natural selection trigger warning was shown would probably fail their exam, therefore not be qualified to practice as a biologist.
1.4.3. Con: Trigger warnings typically advise students that content ahead addresses [sensitive subjects](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trigger-warning-survey_us_565dc81fe4b08e945fec965c). They rarely if ever mention a specific opinion on those subjects. Since people across the political spectrum care about responses to those sensitive subjects, it is unlikely that trigger warnings will allow people to ignore opinions  they don't like more so than they already can.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Trigger warnings, in [most cases](https://www.aacu.org/aacu-news/newsletter/debating-merits-and-flaws-trigger-warning), are as simple as a teacher stating that ‘The reading for this week includes a graphic description of sexual assault,’ or a note on a syllabus that reads, ‘This course deals with sensitive material that may be difficult for some students.’ They do not delve into details, do not 'spoil' the literature piece and do not pass value judgment regarding the content. They merely serve as a warning to people with PTSD who may be looking out for them.
1.4.4. Pro: The current generation needs to be exposed to ideologies that conflict with their own in order to truly understand opposing viewpoints and think critically about their beliefs.
1.4.4.1. Con: The question asks about trigger warnings, which are not related to ideology or opinion, but prevent episodes from those with PTSD. This point is relevant for 'content warnings' but not trigger warnings.
1.4.4.2. Con: People will still be exposed to all things, rather trigger warnings allow for one to mentally prepare for confronting discussion \(such as that surrounding rape, physical assault, car accidents, and other things\), particularly for those that affect people with diagnosed mental illnesses like PTSD \(where triggers are scientifically recognised\)
1.4.5. Pro: If trigger warnings cater to an individual's opinion \(such as: What constitutes hate speech?\), the presenter must presuppose or have a prior understanding of the offence potentially made by the material presented. This indicates the provision of a trigger warning in such circumstances must be a condition of intellectual homogeny. Intellectual homogeny is counterproductive to academic or societal development.
1.4.5.1. Con: Trigger Warnings \(as scientifically proven in the psychology field\) are in place to allow people to mentally prepare for confronting material, particularly those that have been the victim of rape, or people that have PTSD from war related trauma, and many other things. It allows them to engage with material when otherwise they would have to step out \(and thus loose education\). This is already inplace for seziures, why not for discussions around rape, war, and other triggering materials
1.4.6. Con: [Individuals](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/09/13/do-trigger-warnings-work/trust-me-trigger-warnings-are-helpful) who have gone through trauma are often hesitant to publicly discuss it. These people are likelier to participate if their professors use trigger warnings since this shows that the professor is eager to accommodate students with PTSD.
1.5. Pro: The inclusion of trigger warnings promotes the important value of transparency.
1.5.1. Con: Trigger warning aren't fully transparent as to the content of a course. Rather, they offer vague allusions as to possibly offensive aspects of the content which may, in fact, be misleading as to the emphasis or importance of those aspects to the lesson as a whole.
1.5.2. Pro: Everyone should be free to choose their experiences.  They can make a free choice only with enough information beforehand.
1.5.2.1. Con: Students should not be free to choose what they learn. They should be exposed to as many ideas as possible, otherwise they could choose to only expose themselves to opinions they already agree with and topics they already know.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Educational institutions are a time for personal development and hence teachers need to ensure that students' ideas are constantly [challenged](https://flensburgerfiles.wordpress.com/2015/06/26/in-school-in-germany-the-devils-advocate-in-the-classroom/), in a classroom. They should be forced to question their own beliefs and for this purpose, they cannot be given the option of opting out of certain discussions.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.2.1.
1.5.4. Con: The syllabus of a course is typically available to students. A syllabus achieves transparency, as all of the material contained within a course is available to students should they want it.
1.5.4.1. Con: Students should not be expected to read the entirety of their courses' syllabus in detail in order to be warned about content which is easily identifiable as possibly offensive. In order for transparency to be fully achieved, it must be feasible for most students to access transparent information.
1.5.4.2. Con: Most students in a class will be unfamiliar with the material on the syllabus. They take the class in order to learn about it. Without knowing the materials, they are unable to know if triggering content is present without warnings.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: There are [summaries, plot themes and reviews](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/trigger-warnings-college-campus-books) available online ready to be gleaned for many readings, etc. Students can hence take up the responsibility themselves and look up the themes of various works before delving into them. This way they can be prepared to deal with the triggers without putting the burden on institutions.
1.5.4.2.1.1. Con: [Many professors](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/09/21/493913099/content-notice-here-are-a-few-ways-professors-use-trigger-warnings) believe that warnings about content can also often give the punchline too quickly or spoil the plot or lift the suspense. This can, in the long run, render teaching and learning dull affairs.
1.5.4.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.5.5. Pro: Trigger warning are similar to movie ratings, which are meant to shield people from objectionable content in films.
1.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.5.5.2. Con: If a student has a legitimate condition such as PTSD, it is incumbent on the student to avail himself or herself of the appropriate campus resources and advise instructors and professors. However, "objectionable" is not the same as "harmful." If a student simply doesn't like something, that is a different discussion entirely.
1.5.5.2.1. Con: People who suffer from mental illnesses should not be treated differently on the basis of whether they are ready or willing to come out about their conditions or not. Hence trigger warnings should not be provided on the basis of who is identified or not.
1.5.5.2.1.1. Con: By that logic we would have to treat every person as if they are suffering from a mental illness. There is no reason to treat healthy adults as if they were ill.
1.5.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Ill people should be treated accordingly, but it is not necessary or desirable to treat healthy people as if they were ill.
1.5.5.2.1.1.2. Con: One cannot know who is suffering from a mental illness or recovering from trauma by looking at them. It is better for people's well being to err on the side of caution.
1.5.5.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.2.1.1.2.
1.5.5.2.1.3. Pro: Many students, for [example](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/09/13/do-trigger-warnings-work/trust-me-trigger-warnings-are-helpful), sexual assault survivors, are not open about their trauma, perhaps due to the stigma associated with it. These people still deserve to be taken care of in a classroom environment.
1.5.5.2.1.4. Pro: Trigger warnings and the concept of triggers generally have faced a lot of [public ridicule](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/triggerwarning) recently, particularly on the internet. Hence people who suffer from PTSD and genuinely require trigger warnings are often hesitant in asking for them as they are inclined to avoid this public ridicule.
1.5.5.3. Pro: Just as a film teacher would alert students before showing them a sexually explicit scene in a movie \(or skip the scene altogether\), teachers in other fields should warn students about violence, racism, or other controversial content in their class materials.
1.5.6. Pro: Universities should do their best to communicate information to students clearly. Trigger warnings are just that: information to help students be as informed as possible.
1.5.6.1. Con: Students who need trigger warnings would know it. It is incumbent on them to raise the issue to the instructor or professor.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.5.2.1.
1.6. Con: In the realm of higher education, trigger warnings are contrary to the purpose of higher learning. If one chooses to learn at the adult level, it is the duty of the lecturer/teacher to challenge all points of view at times, playing 'devil's advocate' as a teaching device to encourage a constructive rationale. This ideal is supported by Bloom's taxonomy, where some things have to be evaluated for their value before being able to synthesise new.
1.6.1. Con: Students do not get triggered by concepts they are unfamiliar with, rather by concepts and events that bring back traumatic memories and inflict great pain on these students. Hence seeing a teacher advocate ideas, which have such drastic impacts on the well being of these students, will lead to these students developing a very [unfavorable attitude](https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/191276/Horton_umn_0130M_18477.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) towards their teachers. These students will also be uncomfortable in the classroom environment.
1.6.1.1. Con: There have been many documented [instances](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/wilfrid-laurier-university-president-explains-apology-to-lindsay-shepherd-1.4417809) where people \(including students\) that were triggered about a topic they were proven to know nothing about. Re: having an unfavourable attitude toward a teacher and/or the classroom is good...life isn't comfortable and it's important for people to navigate those challenges. If someone requires so much comfort in a classroom, it seems unlikely they will fair any better out in the real world.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Trigger warnings deal with triggers for mental health issues like PTSD, not unfavorable opinions. Being upset is not the same thing as being triggered by something.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.1.
1.6.3. Pro: If someone needs a trigger warning in a place for learning, then they don't belong in those classes. For example someone who has a fear of seeing blood is in the wrong field if they are training in the medical field to be a doctor.
1.6.3.1. Con: It's not always that simple. Consider a film student who is triggered by sexual violence. Some films depict sexual violence. This does not mean the student should refrain from pursuing such a career.
1.6.4. Con: Trigger warnings exist to warn students who may have gone through trauma such as sexual assault that topics that may bring back traumatic memories. Reminding a sexual assault victim of their trauma is in no way related to "challenging their ideas".
1.7. Con: Trigger warnings may provide an illusion that a university is tackling issues of sexism/ racism/ mental health etc., when in fact the opposite may be true.
1.7.1. Pro: Trigger warnings merely provide a superficial way for universities to "claim" they are progressing and taking action against these major issues occurring in universities. However trigger warnings do little to tackle the larger structural problems [present](https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2013/mar/22/why-dont-universities-tackle-racism) in academic institutions.
1.7.1.1. Pro: There is widespread [sexism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/04/metoophd-reveals-shocking-examples-of-academic-sexism) and [sexual misconduct](https://twitter.com/hashtag/metoophd?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag) in academia.
1.7.2. Con: Through trigger warnings, students are made [more sensitive](https://bigthink.com/praxis/a-fascinating-look-at-dangerous-books-that-makes-no-good-point-against-trigger-warnings) to the prevalence of mental health issues in their own surroundings. These students are then more likely to push for awareness campaigns and other helpful measures for mentally ill people in their educational institutions. Hence universities where trigger warnings are practiced are more likely to move towards a more inclusive environment.
1.7.2.1. Pro: A 2018 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28753041) found that students reported that trigger warnings improved their understanding of the severity and sensitivity of certain material. This would indicate that trigger warnings increase overall awareness of issues like sexism, racism and mental health. Individuals and universities may therefore be more likely to attempt to combat those issues' root causes on campus.
1.7.3. Con: -> See 1.7.2.1.
1.7.4. Pro: Supporting students needs to go beyond words on a syllabus or powerpoint.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Protocols already exist to help students with mental health problems. Available help from professionals allows students to be looked after correctly, without academics having to make dangerous generalisations on potential triggers.
1.7.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.7.4.3. Pro: These supports could include things such as free counselling, or mandatory consent classes.
1.7.4.3.1. Pro: In a 2015 [report](https://sites.psu.edu/ccmh/files/2017/10/2015_CCMH_Report_1-18-2015-yq3vik.pdf), the Center for Collegiate Mental Health found that college students seeking counseling grew at five times the rate of enrollment over the last decade.
1.7.4.4. Con: Even if trigger-warnings might not be on their own sufficient for dealing with difficult issues, they may still play an important part of a more comprehensive attempt to do so.
1.7.5. Pro: Trigger warnings can lead to stifling debate and suppressing voices of those who have been affected by sexism, racism or mental health.
1.7.5.1. Pro: It may be more difficult for students who have gone through traumatic events to speak about their experiences on campuses where trigger warnings are used. This is because they may not be in a position to use trigger warnings or face backlash if they fail or forget to use them when discussing their experiences.
1.7.5.2. Con: Trigger warnings don't cut material from the discussion completely. They let people choose whether they want to have those discussions in the classroom or if they prefer another safer setting. Trigger warnings give students the information necessary to decide if they want to have a triggering discussion with a professor or with a licensed social worker in a safe space.
1.7.6. Con: Trigger warnings are not designed to tackle sexism or racism, but to help those suffering from their effects better cope and recover.
1.7.6.1. Con: Regardless of design, trigger warnings are regularly understood and discussed as though they are a solely [progressive](https://thetab.com/uk/durham/2016/02/22/trigger-warnings-everything-wrong-student-left-27068) goal. Universities may feel less pressure to implement other policies which are seen as progressive if they accept the implementation of trigger warnings.
1.7.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.7.7. Pro: Trigger warnings may discourage students from [reading](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/us/warning-the-literary-canon-could-make-students-squirm.html) "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" or "Things Fall Apart" because of racist language, but this leaves them ignorant of the anti-racism messages in the books.
1.7.7.1. Pro: Novels and historical texts, even if offensive to modern readers, can be immensely valuable resources for understanding the historic context and causes of contemporary oppression.
1.8. Pro: The inclusion of trigger warnings protects students from unnecessary harms.
1.8.1. Pro: Examples of such harms are being suddenly exposed to content featuring sensitive material e.g. [sexual assault](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/31/shakespeare-trigger-warning-students-snowflakes-cambridge-university-sexual-abuse-victims).
1.8.1.1. Con: Rape and sexual assault are terrible things that unfortunately have to be [thought](http://www.palatinate.org.uk/in-defence-of-trigger-warnings/) about. Preventing such discussions from happening is another sign of the overly politically correct culture in anglo academic settings.
1.8.2. Pro: Trigger warnings allow students to [mentally prepare](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/31/shakespeare-trigger-warning-students-snowflakes-cambridge-university-sexual-abuse-victims) themselves for the content that is to follow.
1.8.2.1. Pro: [Haylin Belay](http://flavorwire.com/520346/teaching-trigger-warnings-what-pundits-dont-understand-about-the-years-most-controversial-higher-ed-debate), a graduate of Columbia University who suffers from PTSD, claims that in classes where she has received trigger warnings, she has been better able to prepare herself for the discussions and feels that she is likelier to even participate in such discussions.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Trigger warnings facilitate "[self-care](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/he-phrased-it-badly-but-stephen-fry-pointed-out-something-important-trigger-warnings-are-oppressive-a6982731.html)" for students; presenting them with options to either avoid or to prepare for challenging materials.
1.8.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.3.2.1.
1.8.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.9.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.
1.8.4. Con: Trigger warnings create the expectation that students should be offended or upset by information within a lesson. Students may then be subject to [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias), and find lessons more upsetting or offending than they would otherwise as a result.
1.8.4.1. Pro: Psychological [studies](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/day-without-pain/201312/expectations-influence-outcome) have shown that expectations can influence our responses. By telling student that certain material will upset them, it increases the chance that more students will actually become upset.
1.8.5. Con: The use of trigger warnings misrepresents PTSD and mental health conditions more broadly to the public.
1.8.5.1. Pro: Trigger warnings reinforce the stigma against those with mental health by perpetuating the myth that those with mental health conditions are constantly on the verge of ["snapping"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/talking-about-men/201703/trigger-warnings-and-mental-health-where-is-the-evidence).
1.8.5.2. Pro: Assuming that explicit or violent material will “trigger” students is a rather [simplistic](https://theconversation.com/treating-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-confronting-the-horror-28731) view of how trauma and PTSD actually work. PTSD is a complex condition, set off by a number of different factors and specific to each individual. Assuming everyone will be [triggered](https://psmag.com/education/hazards-ahead-problem-trigger-warnings-according-research-81946#.ns19l2zgi) by the same experience is overlooking each individual's pain and life story.
1.8.5.3. Pro: The [widespread](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-goldberg-trigger-warnings-20140520-column.html) [public](http://unnecessarytriggerwarnings.tumblr.com/) [backlash](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/33mhfa/triggerfuckingwarnings_they_are_stupid/) against trigger warnings has led to the ridiculing of the entire concepts of triggers in the public space. This may be damaging for PTSD sufferers who seek to use that language to describe their own experiences.
1.8.6. Pro: Trigger warnings promote a [safer learning environment](http://teaching.monster.com/benefits/articles/9962-the-destination-a-safer-learning-environment).
1.8.6.1. Pro: Safe learning environments where students are not distressed, allow students to better focus on learning and studying.
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: Students are likely to [embrace uncomfortable topics](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/26/us/university-of-chicago-trigger-warnings-safe-spaces/index.html) if they are themselves comfortable with their environment. This environment can be achieved through the use of trigger warnings which make the students feel safer.
1.8.6.1.2. Pro: Trigger warnings help build a [relationship of trust](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/inside_higher_ed/2015/12/trigger_warning_debate_some_professors_say_they_build_trust_others_say_they.html) between the students and professors. People with PTSD see that their professors understand the trauma they go through and are willing to accommodate them. This improves their relationship and is likely to improve the classroom dynamic in the long run.
1.8.6.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.
1.8.6.1.3. Pro: Professors have observed that when students know that their professors care about their well-being, they’re [willing to take more risks](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/inside_higher_ed/2015/12/trigger_warning_debate_some_professors_say_they_build_trust_others_say_they.html) and hence are likely to learn more.
1.8.6.1.4. Pro: Students suffering from trauma do not deserve to be placed at a disadvantage in the classroom by having their experiences triggered.
1.8.6.1.4.1. Pro: Professors who [use trigger warnings](http://flavorwire.com/520346/teaching-trigger-warnings-what-pundits-dont-understand-about-the-years-most-controversial-higher-ed-debate) encourage people to view PTSD the same way they would view any disability, and hence they believe it becomes much more intuitive to make efforts to ensure that these students are made to feel more comfortable in the classroom.
1.8.6.1.4.2. Con: But it gives them the opportunity to share the experience with the class. And the class could help them deal. If they were warned before and stayed away, everyone loses.
1.8.6.2. Pro: Increasingly mental health is a big concern for university students. University can be a difficult time for a regular student, let alone those who have had traumatic pasts. Trigger warnings are one small way universities can help in improving the university experience and environment for everyone.
1.8.6.2.1. Con: University is no more difficult now than it was in the past, and yet students were still able to succeed without trigger warnings.
1.8.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.1.2.
1.8.6.4. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.8.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.3.
1.8.6.6. Pro: Even people who may not need trigger warnings will now be more aware of how content that may appear harmless to them can be quite damaging to their fellows. This holistically can lead to a more [empathetic environment.](http://bigthink.com/praxis/a-fascinating-look-at-dangerous-books-that-makes-no-good-point-against-trigger-warnings)
1.8.6.6.1. Pro: Trigger warnings also remind students with non traumatic pasts that others in the classroom can be suffering from any number of causes. This is very effective in [preparing them](http://It also reminds students that others in the classroom may be suffering from any number of causes, she says, preparing them to enter the real world with more empathy.) to enter the real world with more empathy.
1.8.6.6.1.1. Pro: Trigger warnings also force people to recognize at a young age that their experiences can greatly differ from the experience of those around them and instill a sense of [humility](http://www.uncompromisingedu.com/2016/10/13/teaching-with-trigger-warnings/).
1.8.6.6.2. Pro: Trigger warnings also promote a sense of [accountability](http://www.uncompromisingedu.com/2016/10/13/teaching-with-trigger-warnings/), instilling the fact that while people have the right to express their views, those expressions can have consequences, both for themselves and for others. Trigger warnings can force other students to be more aware of the things they say.
1.8.6.7. Pro: Trigger warnings help students feel comfortable in the classroom
1.8.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.8.6.9. Con: Safety is relative and therefore cannot be achieved universally for all students as the desire for comfort always exceeds the available comfort.
1.8.6.10. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.3.2.1.
1.8.7. Con: Trigger warnings can be privately provided when students with PTSD are identified, in the same way that disabilities are accommodated on a case by case basis. There is therefore little reason to treat all students as if they suffer from PTSD.
1.8.7.1. Pro: Many professors who oppose trigger warnings have explained that they do still [invite students](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/inside_higher_ed/2015/12/trigger_warning_debate_some_professors_say_they_build_trust_others_say_they.html) to raise questions or concerns about course content with them individually. This can facilitate them in identifying students with PTSD without having to use trigger warnings.
1.8.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.5.2.1.1.1.
1.8.7.3. Con: -> See 1.5.5.2.1.
1.8.7.4. Con: According to one [study](https://www.verywellmind.com/traumatic-exposure-and-ptsd-in-college-students-2797431), two-thirds of college students report having experienced at least one traumatic event.
1.8.7.4.1. Con: According to the same [study](https://www.verywellmind.com/traumatic-exposure-and-ptsd-in-college-students-2797431), less than one-tenth of college students show signs of PTSD.
1.8.7.4.1.1. Con: The backlash against trigger warnings shows a general unwillingness to accommodate the [minorities](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/trigger-warnings-college-campus-books), no matter how little effort it requires. In this case, adding a small disclaimer, that anyone without a traumatic past can simply ignore, is being viewed as an inconvenience as it only helps a minority of the students.
1.8.7.4.2. Con: Many people regularly experience traumatic events and do not go on to develop PTSD.  This is because PTSD develops as a result of the way in which those traumatic events are [processed](https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/04/recognizing-trauma-vs-ptsd-quick-primer-symptoms/), not solely as a result of the trauma itself.
1.8.8. Pro: Trigger warnings are useful for those suffering from PTSD. A warning that scenes may involve common cases of trauma such as military combat, child abuse or sexual violence can avoid class disturbances, panic attacks and potentially violent outbreaks. A distinction should be made between trigger warnings \(which has a narrow clinically-linked purpose\) and content notes, the latter flagging undesirable content in a similar manner to movie ratings.
1.8.9. Con: University is meant to prepare and equip young people with the skills to survive in the real world. Trigger warnings are over-protecting students rather than preparing them for adult life which often includes unpleasant and harsh realities.
1.8.9.1. Con: Universities have the responsibility to provide students with the best conditions for them to academically thrive. If the absence of trigger warnings [compromise the students' ability](http://portagenorthernlight.com/4480/opinion/trigger-warnings-procon/) to focus and be comfortable in class; then the universities have the responsibility to include trigger warnings in their classes.
1.8.9.1.1. Pro: Without the use of trigger warnings, students who have had traumatic pasts are always at a [disadvantage](http://portagenorthernlight.com/4480/opinion/trigger-warnings-procon/), since they always feel more insecure compared to other students.
1.8.9.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.1.
1.8.9.1.2. Con: Placing the responsibility on universities, rather than students, to make sure that students are comfortable and capable to engage with established academic knowledge has both disturbing and untenable implications. If universities truly had that responsibility, they would have to feed and house their students for free, as well as totally change courses if students were not comfortable with their content.
1.8.9.1.2.1. Con: The inclusion of trigger warnings is not a measure designed to make students more comfortable directly, but rather to facilitate their autonomous decision-making about what is best for their individual well-being.
1.8.9.1.2.2. Con: Most universities do, in fact, support their most financially vulnerable students, to the effect of providing "free" food and housing. It is sensible that they should be similarly supportive of their most psychologically vulnerable students.
1.8.9.1.2.3. Con: If a course is unpopular enough \(for ANY reason\) that it is attended by very few students or that it draws a large number of complaints, that course is likely to be discontinued or greatly modified. This is not only a responsibility for Universities, it is the only sensible course of action for using limited teaching resources effectively.
1.8.9.1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.
1.8.9.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.8.9.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.6.1.4.
1.8.9.1.5. Pro: The [Americans With Disabilities Act](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Academic-Ethics-The-Legal/238356) requires accommodations for those suffering from mental illnesses, and every institution should have procedures for evaluating requests for accommodation. The moral aim of the ADA is an admirable one, which is to ensure professional, educational, and other opportunities to the greatest extent possible for those who live under the burden of a mental illness. Hence if a student requires trigger warnings, then the ADA entitles that student to receive them.
1.8.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.8.9.3. Con: University classrooms, where direct reference is made to a wide range of potentially disturbing and controversial subjects, are unlike everyday life where such subjects typically do not come up day to day.
1.8.9.4. Con: Young people in University are at a [particularly vunerable](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17450120600863380?src=recsys&journalCode=rvch20) point of their lives. It makes sense to protect them at that point. It does not mean that they will be less able to deal with the realities of life when they are older, more mature and neurologically developed.
1.8.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.1.1.
1.8.9.6. Pro: Educational institutions cannot give students “safe spaces” throughout their life. They need to prepare them for the real world
1.8.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.1.
1.8.9.7. Pro: Much better to learn how to deal with issues in the classroom than wait until the real world.
1.8.9.7.1. Pro: In the classroom, students can explore stating their view with fewer repercussions than in the real world.
1.8.9.7.2. Pro: In the classroom, students can state their viewpoint and expect to receive positive, helpful criticism to clarify how they state their view.
1.8.9.7.3. Pro: In the classroom, students can state their view and expect to receive helpful criticism of the implications of their perspective.
1.8.9.7.4. Pro: In the classroom, students can state their view and expect to hear positive, helpful challenges to the assumptions that they are making.
1.8.9.8. Pro: If students are unable to [read](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/us/warning-the-literary-canon-could-make-students-squirm.html) "The Merchant of Venice" or "The Great Gatsby" without triggering a severe traumatic response, then they are likely incapable of living a functional life as an adult in the real world, where many more disturbing and traumatic events occur without warning.
1.8.10. Pro: Trigger warnings allow students to feel comfortable to remove themselves from a situation that may lead to great mental stress and even breakdowns. This could be so easily averted with the door that trigger warnings provides.
1.8.11. Pro: Trigger warnings help support [women](https://www.verywellmind.com/traumatic-exposure-and-ptsd-in-college-students-2797431), as well as [ethnic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3097040/) and [sexual](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4887282/) minorities, all groups which are more likely to suffer from PTSD.
1.8.11.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.8.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.4.1.1.
1.8.12. Con: The use of trigger warnings often [do little to mitigate the effects of trauma](https://psmag.com/education/hazards-ahead-problem-trigger-warnings-according-research-81946#.grcqdwmhx) since most trauma survivors [do not develop](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11704077) the kind of post-traumatic stress disorder that trigger warnings are designed to protect against.
1.8.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.2.1.
1.8.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.5.2.
1.8.12.3. Con: There are accounts of students, who suffer from PTSD, recounting how they have [benefited](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/09/13/do-trigger-warnings-work/trust-me-trigger-warnings-are-helpful) from the inclusion of trigger warnings in their classes. They have also stated that they felt respected and valued in these classes.
1.8.13. Con: There is [some evidence](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/) that by constantly shielding young people from ideas they dislike or find upsetting, young people are becoming increasingly mentally fragile and incapable or dealing with inevitable stress. This has been linked with the significant rise in mental health illnesses amongst young people.
1.8.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.8.13.2. Con: The linked article is entirely speculative. It contains no statistical evidence that trigger warnings themselves, as opposed to other factors affecting university education and young people's lives, are the cause of increased mental difficulties in young people.
1.8.13.3. Pro: [Literature](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/trigger-warnings-college-campus-books) often offers a vessel through which people with traumatic pasts can cope, grow and possibly get closure. If we warn people explicitly beforehand that inside these readings they are likely to find pain, we do a disservice to the readers who could otherwise benefit from the readings.
1.8.13.4. Pro: Further [studies](https://medium.com/\@CraigHarper19/its-official-trigger-warnings-might-actually-be-harmful-3e8acaae098b?sk=dfba016f8157637c378af8b0c0150b60) have supported Lukianoff and Haidt's contention that trigger warnings might actually be harmful.
1.8.13.5. Pro: Trigger warnings affirm that emotional reasoning is an appropriate response for students in the face of adversity. Cognitive behavioural therapists have [noted](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/) that emotional reasoning is linked with a negatively skewed perception of reality, which has negative effects on mental health.
1.9. Pro: Trigger warnings are a medical necessity for those with PTSD. These are not related to 'content warnings' which are separate and may unnecessarily shelter students. Making trigger warnings required would reduce the argument for a broad range of content warnings.
1.9.1. Con: If medical advice regarding PTSD were sophisticated enough to predict what may create a negative reaction those suffering the condition would be nearly alleviated of all manifestations of the malady.
1.9.2. Con: Trigger warnings could be counter-productive. Even people with PTSD need to face their fears from time to time to heal. Absolute shelter will weaken their ability to overcome traumas and fears.
1.9.2.1. Con: I believe that a trigger warning wouldn't be allowing someone with PTSD to avoid facing their fears, but it would give them the ability to mentally ready themselves to handle the content. This seems like a healthier alternative to just throwing at them with no warning.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: Trigger warnings allow people to make informed decisions about their health.
1.9.2.2. Con: Although exposure therapy is a good treatment for those who have PTSD, there is no need to force them into scenarios where they unexpectedly have to face their trauma. They should do so in a safe environment, with forewarning, and the ability to speak to a mental health professional during treatment. A classroom in the middle of a lecture in a room full of your peers is not a good place to be reexposed to trauma and may create additional trauma and stifle development.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: I agree they shouldn't be forced into the scenario, and a educational setting is certainly not synonymous with a private clinic. However, content notes \(what topics will be covered in a given unit and on what weeks\) would suffice to allow the students to ascertain whether they are able to involve themselves in the unit, or during the classes in which the trauma triggers are present. If they do become stressed, despite voluntarily participating, they can excuse themselves and seek medical help.
1.9.2.2.1.1. Pro: Content Note: Written information provided on the content to be covered in the educational setting. I.e. A unit outline provided by the institution \(viewable prior to enrollment, and further elaborated upon after enrollment in the unit\), and a timeline of the topics covered \(i.e. when they will be discussed\). E.g. A history unit may provide a outline stating "topics to be addressed in this unit; segregation, race violence etc., Timeline; Week 1 - Slavery, Week 2 - Jim Crow Laws etc."
1.9.2.2.1.2. Con: Content descriptions are often vague and do not highlight specific aspects of a particular course which could be reasonably expected to be triggering.
1.9.2.2.2. Pro: Effective exposure therapy is patient-led and done under the guidance of a qualified mental health professional. It is very different to simply presenting a person with a triggering scenario and expecting them to 'face their fears'.
1.9.2.3. Con: It is not for anyone other than the patient and their doctor to decide what triggers they should expose them to and how. Forcing them into a symptom-inducing situation by taking away their ability to make an informed choice is likely to do more harm than good.
1.9.3. Con: Scientific research has found that moderate exposure to "triggering" topics for people with PTSD is actually beneficial for them in the long run. Trigger warnings can make things worse for people who suffer with PTSD, making them feel constantly victimised due to their condition.[sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791618301137)
1.9.3.1. Con: People with PTSD who see trigger warnings can still choose to read/watch/listen to the content. The warning simply allows them to make an informed decision.
1.9.3.2. Con: The research referenced here only studied people who had not experienced trauma. The researchers explicitly state that the results may have been very different with a sample group of people who actually had PTSD.
1.9.4. Con: Trigger warnings are obviously not a "medical necessity" because victims of PTSD have been living without them for hundreds of years
1.9.4.1. Con: The fact that people survived before the widespread introduction of warnings does not mean that they were symptom-free or had a good quality of life.
1.9.4.2. Con: Something does not have to be specifically lifesaving to be medically necessary; amputees lived for hundreds of years without prosthetics, but that does not render artificial limbs unnecessary.
1.9.4.2.1. Con: Because people can and do live without them artificial limbs are in fact a luxury that comes at a cost, and are thus subject to a rational cost/benefit analysis just like trigger warnings
1.9.5. Con: Unless we are talking about public-access content and content funded by taxpayer dollars, the onus of managing medical necessities like PTSD are on patients and their doctors. It's unreasonable to require the broad world of private-sector content to conform to a patient's burden. If you are not ready for it, don't do it.
1.10. Con: Trigger warnings draw undue attention to content that may be rather marginal to the curriculum and therefore act as a distraction \(the same goes for MPAA ratings\).
1.11. Con: Trigger warnings will lead to censorship.
1.11.1. Con: The purpose behind trigger warnings is not to censor information. On the contrary, material that maybe potentially disconcerting is still significant information for students and is included in the syllabus for that reason.
1.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.2.3.
1.11.2. Pro: Trigger warnings have [already](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/censor-lecturers-trigger-warnings-students-distressed) led to censorship. Academics are increasingly under pressure to protect students from disturbing ideas and therefore dutifully have to respond by censoring themselves.
1.11.2.1. Con: The allegation of censorship in the linked article occurred in a classroom where trigger warnings were not in use. Had trigger warnings been utilised, the educator in question may have been in a better position to discuss the Hungarian Holocaust without fearing that his students would be distressed or surprised by the material.
1.11.2.2. Con: The linked article speculates that censorship may occur as a result of sensitivity over certain subjects. That is not the same thing as actual censorship of ideas and has little to do with trigger warnings.
1.11.3. Pro: The regular use of trigger warnings in an educational context may lead to effective censorship by creating a [chilling effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect) on academic speech. Professors may be less willing to discuss controversial material, even with a trigger warning, because of the risk of falling afoul of the rules for their implementation or facing public backlash.
1.11.3.1. Pro: Teachers may decide it is simply easier to exclude controversial material than to go through the process of deciding whether or not it merits a trigger warning, followed by the actual implementation of trigger warnings.
1.11.4. Pro: Making any part  of an academic course optional will undermine the education of the student unless an alternative is provided with equal academic relevance.
1.11.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.11.5. Pro: Gaging sensitivity to topics prevents the flow of thinking and conversing. If warnings become the norm, then disclaimers for every thought or point which could be construed as offensive will prevent conversations from moving forward and sound like constant apologies rather than points.
1.11.6. Pro: As a result of trigger warnings some students may easily avoid whole topics, be absent from class or decide not to partake in assignments. In this way trigger warnings will lead to censorship on an individual basis.
1.11.6.1. Pro: The use of trigger warnings sets a [precedent](http://portagenorthernlight.com/4480/opinion/trigger-warnings-procon/) that it is fair to avoid topics that may cause discomfort. This can lead to impede students' ability to question their own knowledge and step out of their comfort zones.
1.11.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.8.6.1.3.
1.11.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.11.6.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.7.4.
1.11.6.2. Pro: Schools are a place to learn other point of view, not filtered by your beliefs.
1.11.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.1.
1.11.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.11.4.
1.11.6.4. Pro: Trigger warnings for great works of literature, including [Shakespeare](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/cambridge-university-trigger-warnings-shakespeare-plays-titus-andronicus-mary-beard-academics-a8008456.html), will discourage students from reading.
1.11.6.4.1. Con: It is a stretch to say that a trigger warning will stop students from reading- they may skip especially graphic scenes at times they do not feel prepared to read them- but in order to take the class they will have to confront the material at some point or fail the class.
1.11.6.4.1.1. Con: It's an unfair assumption to assume that the work on which a trigger warning is issued will always be evaluated work.
1.11.7. Con: -> See 1.2.4.
1.11.8. Pro: Accusing an educational professional of failing to note trigger warnings can be used as a tool to unfairly silence and punish those teachers who hold opinions which are deemed offensive or controversial.
1.11.8.1. Con: While it is possible that failing to note trigger warnings may lead to unwanted consequences in a teacher's career, there's no documented evidence it actually happens.
1.11.8.1.1. Con: Some professors have faced [threats](http://www.businessinsider.com/students-demand-firing-of-evergreen-state-college-professor-2017-5) or [firing](https://mic.com/articles/129082/students-at-kansas-university-want-a-professor-fired-for-using-the-n-word#.dFtQ9Qo2F) for expressing views that upset their students.
1.11.8.2. Pro: Teachers and lecturers without [tenure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_tenure) are particularly vulnerable to any accusations of impropriety and so may be particularly reluctant to broach important but controversial areas.
1.11.8.3. Pro: Many commentators and researchers have noted the increasing division and intensity of the political climate on college campuses. This context makes the abuse of trigger warnings for political ends more likely.
1.11.8.3.1. Pro: A 2010 [study](https://www.aacu.org/sites/default/files/files/core_commitments/engaging_diverse_viewpoints.pdf) from the American Association of Colleges and Universities found that only 30 percent of college seniors and 17 percent of professors strongly agree it’s safe to hold unpopular points of view on campus.
1.12. Con: It onerously requires the speaker to anticipate the contents and the resilience of the minds of a diverse audience. Any 'trigger list' cannot be exhaustive.
1.13. Con: Trigger warnings are overly paternalistic.
1.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.1.
1.13.2. Con: Trigger warnings are not paternalistic, as they do not force the person to leave the lecture or class- they simply advise of what is to follow and allow the student to decide if they are in a place suitable to tackle that content.
1.13.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.3.2.
1.13.3. Pro: Trigger warnings may conceal the fact that education demands facing critical, even painful situations in order to transform them. Besides that, there's the fact that education can't be ruled by individual trauma.
1.13.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.1.
1.13.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.3.2.
1.13.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.13.4. Con: Trigger warnings are not paternalistic as they do not make the student's decision for them. In fact, they [directly put the onus on the students](http://flavorwire.com/520346/teaching-trigger-warnings-what-pundits-dont-understand-about-the-years-most-controversial-higher-ed-debate) and allows them the chance to deal with their trauma, while acknowledging that professors understand the material might be unpleasant.
1.13.4.1. Pro: Trigger warnings enhance a student's independence and encourage adult behaviour, allowing them to decide for themselves what they wish to learn, based on the given information.
1.13.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.13.5. Pro: The use of trigger warnings may improperly prepare students for fields of work wherein they will encounter disturbing content without any warnings. The use of trigger warnings in [law classes](https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/05/oxford-law-requires-courses-trigger-warnings/) has been criticised for this reason.
1.13.5.1. Con: Lawyers have discretion over what areas of law and what cases they choose to involve themselves with. They need not ever tackle an area that makes them feel deeply uncomfortable should they wish to do so.
1.13.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.
1.13.6. Pro: Many professors are against trigger warnings as they make [comfort a higher priority](https://www.aaup.org/article/mandated-trigger-warnings-threaten-academic-freedom) than intellectual engagement.
1.13.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.13.7. Pro: By artificially shielding students from uncomfortable situations you are depriving them of the experience to learn adequate coping mechanisms for dealing with discomfort.
1.13.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.13.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.
1.13.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.13.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.13.9. Pro: Trigger warnings place the burden on the person presenting the material. It belongs to the people who have legitimate issues with some types of content.
1.13.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.
1.13.10. Pro: If we protect students \(especially kids\) from everything, we make weak, hesitant, irresponsible people. People who want so many trigger warnings are like the people in the anti-vaccination movement, just in a psychological sense, not a physical one.
1.13.11. Pro: Full marketplace of ideas promotes use of judgement & critical thinking skills. Warning about content imposes a judgement on the topic & presupposes that the audience is not equipped to handle the topic.
1.13.12. Pro: Trigger warnings might be considered as condescending to bright students, many of whom are young adults and can decide for themselves whether the information will affect them on a personal level.
1.13.12.1. Pro: Trigger warnings are part of the ever increasing [nanny state](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/nanny-state-index-state-interference-smoking-drinking-junk-food-a7727571.html), where people are subconsciously being directed on how to live their lives. Trigger points feed into this on a smaller scale, insinuating what students should be worried about while studying.
1.13.12.2. Con: Trigger warnings don't instruct a person how to feel about controversial content, only that the controversial content is present.
1.14. Con: Trigger warnings violate norms of academic freedom.
1.14.1. Con: Educators are already highly limited in the material they can present by student ability, time in class and university mandated syllabi. In comparison, trigger warnings present a relatively minor limitation of academic freedom.
1.14.2. Pro: In the humanities and social sciences, the majority of topics could potentially be troubling for students. Academics are walking on eggshells, increasingly encouraged to adopt the role of "[amateur clinicians](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/censor-lecturers-trigger-warnings-students-distressed)".
1.14.2.1. Pro: University professors are not qualified to assess their students' mental health or decide what should qualify as a "trigger."
1.14.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.
1.14.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.1.
1.14.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.6.
1.14.3. Con: Trigger warnings could broaden academic freedom as professors could set any topic they want, and only those who feel comfortable to sit through a lecture need attend.
1.14.3.1. Pro: Trigger warnings can often make it easier for professors to include sensitive material in their courses. There are [professors](http://flavorwire.com/520346/teaching-trigger-warnings-what-pundits-dont-understand-about-the-years-most-controversial-higher-ed-debate) who claim that the use of trigger warnings makes them more comfortable when introducing content they might otherwise be leery of introducing since they are now sure that the students with traumatic pasts are more equipped to deal with the content.
1.14.3.2. Con: -> See 1.11.4.
1.14.3.3. Pro: Mandating the use of trigger warnings may protect lecturers from possible lawsuits due to harm caused to vulnerable students. By introducing processes to protect themselves from potential lawsuits, lecturers may feel more empowered to discuss topics they feel are important.
1.14.3.4. Con: Many trigger warning policies encourage professors to avoid potentially triggering material if possible. For example, the trigger warning policy of [Oberlin College](https://www.aaup.org/report/trigger-warnings) cautioned faculty to “\[r\]emove triggering material when it does not contribute directly to the course learning goals.”
1.14.4. Con: The norms of academic freedom should not be set in stone. Academic institutions should be flexible and adjust their behaviors to meet present day standards.
1.14.4.1. Pro: [Academic freedom](https://www.aacu.org/aacu-news/newsletter/debating-merits-and-flaws-trigger-warning) prevails when people have the ability to speak up for their right. This is the motivation behind students demanding trigger warnings. Hence, trigger warnings are not supposed to make education 'easier'. Rather they redefine academic freedom to create educational environments, that affirmatively welcome all students while challenging them simultaneously.
1.14.5. Pro: If educational institutions have policies mandating trigger warnings then topics associated with triggers are likely to be [marginalized if not avoided altogether](https://www.aaup.org/article/mandated-trigger-warnings-threaten-academic-freedom) by faculty members. This is because these faculty members would be fearful of complaints for discomforting or offending their students.
1.14.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.3.
1.14.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.8.1.1.
1.14.6. Pro: The [freedom and creativity](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/trigger-warnings-college-campus-books) of authors is bound to suffer when their works become relegated to categories of "triggering".
1.14.7. Con: Academic freedom should also protect the right to use trigger warnings if professors deem them pedagogically useful. Hence actions by universities meant to affirm freedom in learning, ironically, seem to deny one part of it. An example is the [University of Chicago](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/u-of-chicagos-condemning-of-safe-spaces-and-trigger-warnings-reignites-debate/113760), where trigger warnings have been condemned and as a result, the right of teachers to give trigger warnings if they choose to, has been [violated](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Academic-Ethics-The-Legal/238356).
1.14.7.1. Pro: Instructors can be expected to exercise both discretion in warning their students about potentially disturbing content and tolerance towards those who choose to not view or engage with that content. This can be dealt with on a case by case basis and would not necessarily require a university mandate.
1.14.8. Con: The absence of trigger warnings can very often debilitate students with PTSD from learning in a classroom. The [academic freedom of these students](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/u-of-chicagos-condemning-of-safe-spaces-and-trigger-warnings-reignites-debate/113760) is hence only protected if the institutions include trigger warnings.
1.14.9. Pro: Freedom of speech implies no "[barriers](http://theconversation.com/why-safe-spaces-at-universities-are-a-threat-to-free-speech-94547)" should be implemented between writer and audience. The voices and experiences of traumatic events or situations should be expressed even if it is considered upsetting.
1.14.9.1. Con: "Freedom of Speech" refers to your freedom from legal prosecution by the government for expressing opinions. It does not, in any way, imply that verbal warnings of any sort violate a person's given freedoms. Further, a verbal warning of content which is upcoming and may be upsetting in no way serves as a "barrier" between the write or orator and their audience.
1.14.10. Con: Even when the provision of trigger warnings is mandatory, there is [a small number of courses and a small number of modules](https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Brief-Guide-to-the-Battle/237600) within these courses that actually require trigger warnings. For instance, most science subjects, as well as business subjects, do not require trigger warnings at all. Hence while certain courses within the social sciences may be impacted by trigger warnings, they do not influence academic norms in a drastic way.
1.14.11. Pro: Trigger warnings limit professors' academic freedom by limiting their ability to include sensitive material when they deem it appropriate.
1.14.11.1. Con: -> See 1.14.3.1.
1.14.11.2. Con: -> See 1.14.3.4.
1.14.11.3. Pro: Shielding students from topics makes it increasingly difficult to teach important historical events such as the [Holocaust](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/11/censor-lecturers-trigger-warnings-students-distressed) which is built upon human suffering. Approaching such traumatic subjects is a challenge from the onset since teachers need to appease the sensitivity levels of students.
1.14.11.4. Pro: According to the [1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure](https://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure), professors should not introduce controversial topics which have "no relation to their subject." But as long as materials are related to the course, they have freedom to express themselves in the classroom.
1.14.11.5. Con: Trigger warnings don't limit sensitive material any more than an R rating limits sensitive material in a movie. The warnings are simply alerting the students to the presence of sensitive material.
1.14.11.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.2.1.1.1.5.2.3.
1.14.11.5.2. Con: -> See 1.14.3.4.
1.14.12. Pro: Free discussion and debate within classrooms is an essential aspect of education. Since students are not in a position to offer trigger warnings in the way that a teacher might be, trigger warnings may have the effect of stifling classroom debate.
1.14.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.
1.14.12.2. Pro: Teachers can use lesson plans to decide if they should issue a trigger warning before a class. Students are rarely so prepared. In an environment where trigger warnings are normal for controversial or offensive topics, students may feel unwilling or uncomfortable in voicing any opinion on such issues.
1.14.12.3. Pro: The use of trigger warnings by teachers in lessons creates the expectation that they are necessary if controversial subject matter is to be broached. Since students are not in the same position as teachers to issue trigger warnings, this may mean that issues which are seen as controversial are rarely discussed in classrooms, even when they are relevant to the topic at hand.
1.14.13. Pro: The use of trigger warnings in [literature](https://bigthink.com/praxis/warning-this-post-may-trigger-an-emotional-reaction) classes may undermine the comprehension of that literature. Often shocking material in art is effective because it is unexpected or harrowing. Trigger warnings may mean that students never fully experience literature, as they are cushioned from its real impact.
1.14.13.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.1.
1.14.13.2. Con: "Comprehension" surely refers to familiarity with the key themes and ideas being explored \(by a text in this case\). Being alerted to some of these themes and ideas in advance would surely improve comprehension, especially of texts where traumatic themes are explored in indirect ways.
1.14.13.3. Con: Students are regularly exposed in advance to summaries and extracts of material they are going to encounter: blurbs of books, trailers for movies and descriptions of art pieces are all examples of this, and it would be strange to suggest that these prevent them from "fully experiencing" these media. Trigger warnings are simply pointed examples of these.
1.14.13.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.13.3.
1.14.13.5. Pro: There is often little [distinction](https://www.salon.com/2014/05/19/trigger_alerts_are_dumbing_down_education/) made between a trigger and an intended emotional response. Stories and writings that do not induce an emotional response are not doing their jobs. It is hence not always wrong to have a cathartic response to a writing, often it can be very healthy and profound one.
1.14.13.6. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.14.13.7. Pro: There have been [reports of students](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Academic-Ethics-The-Legal/238356) who thought that Greek mythology and Roman poetry needed "trigger warnings,"; claiming that "These texts can be difficult to read and discuss as a survivor, a person of color, or a student from a low-income background." However feeling that your identity is "marginalized" is far removed from suffering from PTSD. And a prohibition on "narratives of exclusion and oppression" would put off limits most of world history.
