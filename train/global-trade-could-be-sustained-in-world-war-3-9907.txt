Discussion Title: Global trade could be sustained in World War 3.

1. Global trade could be sustained during World War 3.
1.1. Pro: The globally integrated economy discourages a drawn-out war. A new World War would therefore end quickly and without damaging the foundations of global trade.
1.2. Con: Global supply chains would be disrupted as they would inevitably be sustained by nations that suffer from the war.
1.3. Pro: Global trade discourages the spread of war zones beyond hot spots and around the whole globe. World War 3 would thus likely be a confined war.
1.4. Con: As many countries are tied up in alliances, they would all be drawn into the war, thus leaving little space for trade among uninvolved nations.
1.5. Pro: Cheap products that are agile and mobile are needed in war.
1.6. Con: Nations that try to keep neutral and continue trading might be considered traitorous by all sides in a World War, thus discouraging this behavior.
1.7. Pro: Sustaining trade is a matter of national security for countries as their economies are dependent on it; it is therefore in their interest to keep trade running even during a World War.
