Discussion Title: Should Infant Circumcision Be Banned?

1. Infant circumcision should be banned
1.1. Con: Circumcision is a safe procedure.
1.1.1. Con: On average, 117 infant deaths annually are related to circumcision in the US alone. [Lost Boys study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240804903_Lost_Boys_An_Estimate_of_US_Circumcision-Related_Infant_Deaths)
1.1.2. Con: Circumcision is [shown to be linked](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/07/339465.full.pdf+html) to sudden infant death. The amount of pain caused by circumcision stresses an infant regulatory system.
1.1.3. Con: This presupposes that circumcision is not a form of harm.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Many types of amputations and body modifications can be done relatively safely. This does not mean that they should be inflicted on babies without genuine medical necessity.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Given the effectiveness of modern surgical procedures it is probably safe to remove much of an infant's ears for cosmetic reasons as well. Clearly doing so would be unethical despite any cultural sanctions or proclamations of safety.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Parents are allowed to pierce their children's ears. Whilst less extreme than removing larger portions of an ear, the principle of allowing parents a certain degree of choice over decisions affecting their child's body is something which exists elsewhere in society.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Piercing of an infant's ears is a possibly harmful bodily alteration without the subject's consent and without a medical need, and should also be banned.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: Parents wishing to ornate their child with earrings may employ non-permanent solutions.
1.1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: -> See discussion #17841: Ear piercing of newborns should be banned.
1.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Circumcision is an irreversible procedure and therefore goes beyond most of the areas in which the state trusts parents to make decisions for their child.
1.1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Any religion based procedure should be banned.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2. Con: It should never be a question of if the State trusts its People. It should only ever be a question if the People trust their State.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Government is only useful in as far as it protects the rights of its people. By taking power where it does not require it, it opens avenues for overreach of power and violation of peoples' rights.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Governments should wait to see the results of the proposed circumcision ban in Iceland before considering implementing it in others countries, as it may not work as well as hoped.
1.1.3.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: The freedom of speech is an example. If a government deems it unsafe for the people to hear about certain points of view, and [labels](http://libertyhangout.org/2017/05/socialists-always-hated-free-speech-look-maos-silencing-dissent/) those who hold and share that view as criminals, then it could quickly turn into a tyrannical government that would have "justification" to kill a large portion of its people.
1.1.3.2.1.2.3. Con: Many decisions parents are allowed to make have irreversible effects on a child: the level of education provided affects their future income, decisions of what foods a child eats can have future health implications.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4. Con: It is not irreversible as methods [exist](http://www.cirp.org/pages/restore.html) to reverse the procedure later in life.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.1. Con: Surgical foreskin restoration is prohibitively [expensive](http://www.norm.org/surgery.html) and does not always work.
1.1.3.2.1.2.4.2. Con: The restoration of foreskin through non-surgical means takes 1-3 years, requires a great deal of effort and because the process involves [stretching](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255154/) the remaining skin, the foreskin can never be fully restored as the [frenulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenulum_of_prepuce_of_penis) cannot be re-grown. It is inaccurate to claim that this is a full reversal of the procedure.
1.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Parents make a variety of choices for a child, controlling the food a child eats, the shots a child gets, the schooling a child receives, the clothes the child wears. Deciding that circumcision and not anything else that parents have done \(piercings, blood draws, hair cuts\) imposes on autonomy is inconsistent.
1.1.3.2.1.3.1. Con: It would also unacceptably infringe on the child's future independence if their parents unilaterally decided to place permanent tattoos all over his/her body. The point is the lack of objective necessity and the immutability of the consequences of the choice the parents make on the child's behalf.
1.1.3.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: In many places worldwide, it is forbidden for a child get a tattoo or other body modification, even with consent of a parent. There is no reason for circumcision to be excluded from laws like these.
1.1.3.2.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: No parent has the right to mutilate their child, be that through cutting, branding or tattooing.
1.1.3.2.1.3.2. Con: All humans have the right to bodily autonomy regardless of stage of life. Just because infants are arguably not conscious does not allow you to cause them undue harm. You cannot cause harm to unconscious adults, for instance.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3. Con: The proposed 'violations' of autonomy are either non-permanent, trivial or in the best interests of the child. In the instance of schooling, for example, a child would be unable to make a decision regarding what school to attend. Waiting till they are of age is insufficient as their mental development would be stunted.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1. Con: Performing the circumcision on the 8th day, as prescribed by religious law is in the best interest of the infant. Waiting for them to be able to consent would risk something going horribly wrong in the meantime and it being "too late."
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: For this same reason, we give vaccines and immunizations before the child is old enough to consent to them.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Correlated effect is evidence of the efficacy of vaccines. Where as there is [little medical support for circumcising infants](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/circumcision-in-boys/#medical-reasons-for-a-boy-to-have-a-circumcision).
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2. Con: Vaccines are proven to dramatically reduce the rates of the respective disease. So effective, in fact, that in some Western nations diseases have been [eradicated entirely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases).
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1. Con: But the question isn't about some correlated effect -- it is about personal choice. If the child might exercise his autonomy later and not want to have been vaccinated regardless of what result might have occurred, an autonomy argument, applied consistently would have the shots never be given. The ends, if it doesn't justify the means in one case, can't be said to justify them in another.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: In the instance of vaccines, the ends - saving the child's life and the lives of countless other children and adults - justify the means - a relatively painless injection.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Vaccines are neither painless, nor risk-free.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The parent does not claim vaccinations are risk free, but that the \(Very minor\) risk justifies the means.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Circumcision provides health benefits in the same way that vaccines do, so if invasive but beneficial vaccines should be allowed, so should circumcision.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3. Con: This position is based on a set of values, just like the justification of circumcision is based on another set of values. Values cannot be objectively measured and compared.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Parents must live with their decision and therefore do what is best for their child. Every family is different. What is best for one may be totally offensive for another.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Actually parents are not allowed to do whatever they want to their child, even if they think it is for the best of the child. As sad as it is, sometimes society must step in to protect the child from his/her own parents. Laws haven been already created to protect the children from many other forms of violence by their parents.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.2. Con: What parents think is the best for their child may not be beneficial to the child in any way.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Values are subjective but that does not excuse us from making a decision. When values conflict, society needs to resolve the conflict by deciding which one of them is more important - parents' authority to perform religious rights or children's rights to bodily autonomy.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: What is considered ethical by a society varies both geographically and in time. Witch burnings were ethical by the standards of the contemporary society.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Vaccination denial increases the risk of epidemics, thus threatening to violate the universal right to life of third parties. The benefits of circumcision in upholding the other's right to life are at best not obvious.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.1.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.3. Con: Vaccination is [objectively good for the child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases) and [humans as a whole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity) and is proven to cause little or no harm. In this case the risk of disease outweighs the risk from the vaccinations. As would be the case if the child was being circumcised for [medical reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision#Medical).
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: The [vast majority](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2128632/) of circumcisions are performed for cosmetic reasons, not for medical necessity. If the infant had a rare foreskin cancer then a circumcision would be ethical. But not just because the parents think it looks better or aligns with their cultural beliefs.
1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.2. Con: [It's rare for circumcision to be recommended for medical reasons in boys.](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/circumcision-in-boys/)
1.1.3.2.1.3.4. Con: All of the given examples are already subject to limitations by law or society. You cannot starve a child, or feed them sewage. You cannot inject them with heroin. You cannot force them to wear sandpaper, or walk around naked. There is no inconsistency in applying a similar restriction to circumcision.
1.1.4. Con: Rabbis [pass](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1542/peds.114.2.e259) [herpes](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/07/health/new-york-neonatal-herpes/index.html) to the baby [during](https://www.timesofisrael.com/two-infants-diagnosed-with-herpes-after-metzitzah-bpeh) [metzitzah](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/herpes-babies-jewish-circumcision-ritual-link-rabbis-infants-a7620446.html).
1.1.4.1. Con: In isolated cases, when a glass tube is not used \(as is the norm\), a rabbi has been accused of passing herpes to the baby. Since the incidence is low and there is already a suitable alternative method, this argument should be against one method, not the entire notion of the procedure.
1.1.5. Con: While many surgeries for infants are safe, the majority of circumcisions are done [without any anesthesia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9606247).  No other surgery is performed on babies without anesthesia.
1.1.5.1. Pro: If there is no anesthesia, the person will suffer pain. If you voluntary make a person suffer pain \(especially a baby, that couldn't even defend itself\) without its consent and for no medical reason, it should be considered as an act of violence, bad treatments, and even barbarism \(that's still a mutilation\).
1.1.5.2. Con: The absence of anaesthesia does not compromise the safety.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: If the pain makes the baby to move a lot to try to avoid it, it can make the surgery harder to execute.
1.1.6. Con: Unnecessary surgical procedures are never 'safe', especially when the subject is an infant.
1.1.6.1. Pro: Circumcision is surgery; the foreskin has a double-layered fold of smooth muscle tissue, blood vessels, neurons, skin and a mucous membrane. As such, it comes with the risks of any major surgery.
1.1.6.2. Pro: Circumcision is surgery; the foreskin has a double-layered fold of smooth muscle tissue, blood vessels, neurons, skin and a mucous membrane; as such it comes with the risks of any major surgery.
1.1.6.3. Pro: Most medical procedures on infants have a greater element of associated risk than procedures on adults.
1.1.6.3.1. Con: The problem is that most other medical procedures performed on infants are required for saving their lives or curing illness/injury, but circumcisions are almost purely cosmetic.
1.1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Circumcision is an [elective surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878423/), meaning it is not mandatory but personal choice. This indicates it is not a necessity.
1.1.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: Removing a child's teeth to avoid tooth decay is unnecessary, so is removing a child's foreskin to avoid potential risk of infection. In a first world country, hygiene standards are high enough for the risk to be negligible.
1.1.6.3.1.1.1.1. Con: This is a false equivalency, tooth decay carries an untold number of associated complications, as well as [causing several painful and disruptive symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tooth-decay/). Having a foreskin does not.
1.1.6.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Any risk presented by an elective surgery to prevent minor infections is unacceptable.
1.1.6.3.1.1.1.3. Con: In the UK, there isn't an overwhelming amount of infections of the penis in uncircumcised children, so tooth decay is an erroneous comparison.
1.1.6.3.2. Pro: [Infants are at increased risk of amide local anaesthetic toxicity](https://watermark.silverchair.com/mkh041.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAaYwggGiBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGTMIIBjwIBADCCAYgGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMPdecyF1nhFBAyqYWAgEQgIIBWRM1cmw2gdUV_496PZGm25f7Ox45DSXwQPV9mskBgrELcfqjydHGHz7R3-sE-1ENyakS01kugMIXffb4eITk8oq_Lyqcqoky0kBP4EwmsyNb1TdIerBpmFq7_iCWA_iH1P3_XCMiqHYh2tcHKGh9eiB8ytFLLVcE2wekAwSakpnkCLzFnJ6hKV1C2rCHmxc5XMPh-5xUieQxp_0nff5Lq6aR2hINFYts-VH6sVuCqjReXRjI-WAuD0FmIogWob3Zs5k_mwyg3kiBYY-EZGtdZaVOSQdMW1oX6mZfBCOBTBfYqa8mHNyOI1DBQ1eX_8UyzQvfbFfYLXkvx6sfPki1SXYqBI4fZn8yFJaNOqZ0xyTv7ybK1QYBn1J3HgqPN98rR1t_NoMpZPWCW2hSRImxYSOvupgpjxlFUUJirkWq78q6tP2dvRsqgRQMIWNHFoPJj3yMGQrbhBilkw). There are also several other technical issues to consider when treating infants.
1.1.6.3.2.1. Con: This is about the type or the fact of painkilling as part of the process and not about circumcision itself.
1.1.6.3.3. Con: Circumcision has far lower risks when done on infants than on adults. [Complications of adult circumcision](http://www.healthcommunities.com/urologic-surgery/adult-circumcision.shtml).
1.1.6.3.3.1. Con: The risks of childhood circumcision are almost identical to adult circumcision [Complications of infant circumcision](http://www.healthcommunities.com/urologic-surgery/children/benefits-of-circumcision.shtml)
1.1.7. Con: Botched circumcisions can lead to drastic side effects.
1.1.7.1. Con: In 2011 alone, nearly a dozen infant boys had to be treated for “life threatening haemorrhage, shock or sepsis” as a result of their non-therapeutic circumcisions at a single children’s hospital in Birmingham. This information was made public due to a specific freedom of information request, and so would not otherwise have been reported. It is clear, then, that we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg in terms of risks and complications. [Skeptic article](https://www.skeptic.org.uk/magazine/onlinearticles/infant-circumcision/) and [Original data](https://www.secularism.org.uk/uploads/foi-bch-response-received-260612.pdf).
1.1.7.2. Pro: Robert Baker [estimated](http://www.cirp.org/library/death/) 229 deaths per year from circumcision in the United States.
1.1.7.2.1. Pro: The death toll of USA police forces on Black people in 2016 was 266 according to [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database#). The estimate on infant deaths following circumcision is so close to that. It is surprising there isn't more outrage of the parents.
1.1.7.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.
1.1.7.3. Pro: One of the health complications that results is where there is [not enough skin left](http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/vanduyn1/), and every erection creates ripping in the skin. Lesser forms of this afflict many people, hence the rise of lube.
1.1.7.4. Con: Most complications are [minor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253617/) and can be managed easily.
1.1.7.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.1.7.5. Pro: When complications do arise, they may require surgical correction that results in a [significant cost](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253617/) to the health care system.
1.1.7.6. Con: [Complication rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253617/) depend on multiple factors, including anatomic abnormalities, medical comorbidities, surgical technique, and patient age. Proper selection of patients can help reduce complication rates.
1.1.7.6.1. Con: Children are usually not 'properly selected'. It is mostly done on basis of religious or cultural preferences.
1.1.7.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.1.7.6.3. Con: There is no medical need for circumcising an infant.
1.1.7.6.3.1. Pro: Some branches of Orthodox Christianity, specifically [Coptic](http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160524221430/http://omnilogos.com/christianity-coptic/), [Ethiopian](http://www.ethiopianorthodox.org/english/dogma/sacrabaptism.html) and [Eritrean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church), practise circumcision as a right of passage.
1.1.7.6.3.1.1. Con: This argument is an [appeal to tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition) and is therefore invalid. 'Because we have done it for a long time' is never a valid argument to continue a practice that is generally considered unacceptable, like [Stoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning#Ancient_history), for instance.
1.1.7.6.3.1.1.1. Con: This is not an appeal to tradition, but instead is a reminder of religious law.
1.1.7.6.3.1.1.1.1. Con: "Religious law" is a form of tradition. Simply because the perceived origins are divine, does not make it any less so.
1.1.7.6.3.1.2. Con: Using a religious law to justify a religious practice depends on whether one believes in the teachings of that religion. [Whether God exists](https://www.kialo.com/the-existence-of-god-2629/2629.0=2629.1/=2629.1) is a contested question.
1.1.7.6.3.1.2.1. Con: In secular societies actions are governed by secular laws, not religious laws. Actions that violate secular laws are therefore forbidden.
1.1.7.6.3.1.2.2. Con: It is not necessary to believe in the teachings of a religion to respect the right of its adherents to follow it. Because religion is of immense importance to many people, it should be respected even if there is no conclusive proof that God exists.
1.1.7.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.3.1.1.
1.1.7.6.3.3. Con: There are medical reasons as to why infant circumcision is necessary such as in [paraphimosis](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/442883-overview), [phimosis](https://urology.ucsf.edu/patient-care/children/phimosis), and [balanitis](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/184715.php). Completely banning it for everyone is illogical.
1.1.7.6.3.3.1. Pro: No one contests the ethics of infant circumcision when \(and only when\) it is medically necessary. No medically necessary treatment for anything should be banned in all cases. This debate is regarding performing routine infant circumcision when there is no imminent medical need.
1.1.7.6.3.3.2. Con: [Preputioplasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preputioplasty) can be an alternative to circumcision in case of phimosis.
1.1.7.6.3.3.3. Con: Phimosis can be [prevented](https://urology.ucsf.edu/patient-care/children/phimosis). It can be treated without circumcision too.
1.1.7.6.3.3.4. Con: There can be medically approved exemptions to the ban on circumcision. This can be done while banning infant circumcision at the same time.
1.1.7.6.3.4. Pro: One can wash one's genitals properly.
1.1.7.6.3.4.1. Pro: Circumcision is not a contemporary health practice. It was introduced in societies that lived in unhygienic surroundings.
1.1.7.6.3.4.2. Con: Male circumcision allows for greater ease in completing hygiene routines later in life.
1.1.7.6.3.4.2.1. Pro: Circumcision allows a male to go through life with less necessitated maintenance, e.g. smegma buildups can cause serious health risks.
1.1.7.6.3.4.2.2. Pro: It relieves the laborious necessity of pulling back the foreskin before washing.
1.1.7.6.3.4.2.2.1. Con: The act of pulling back the foreskin is a minor action as part of the overall washing process, so the difference is completely negligible.
1.1.7.6.3.4.2.3. Pro: Not being circumcised can cause more avoidable pains throughout life than a one-time circumcision surgery due to sensitivity of the glans, infectious buildup, problems with proper cleaning in children and youth.
1.1.7.6.3.4.2.3.1. Pro: Uncircumcised children [in this study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/81/4/537?ijkey=72c81c33695e121bea2728fba0d7162a75284093&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha&sso=1&sso_redirect_count=1&nfstatus=401&nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token) had a higher rate of penile problems by age 8 than neonatally circumcised children.
1.1.7.6.3.4.2.3.2. Pro: Uncircumcised children [in this study](http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/herzog1/) had a higher rate of foreskin problems such as balanitis and irritation.
1.1.7.6.3.4.2.3.2.1. Con: The study notes that "most of the problems were minor".
1.1.7.6.3.4.2.3.2.2. Con: The control group for this study was composed of boys who had been circumcised. In other words, they did not have foreskins. One would expect the incidence of foreskin problems in such a group to be zero. However, some foreskin problems were noted. A group without foreskins seems an unsatisfactory control group with which to compare the incidence of foreskin problems.
1.1.7.6.3.4.2.3.2.3. Con: Retrospective studies are inherently limited in their ability to control for confounding factors, such as type of hygienic care.
1.1.7.6.3.4.2.4. Con: This 'greater ease' is saving no more than a few seconds. That kind of marginal benefit is hardly worth it.
1.1.7.6.3.4.2.5. Pro: It is easier for nurse's aide to clean a circumcised man, but it is nearly impossible to clean a non-circumcised man.
1.1.7.6.3.4.3. Con: "Can" and "actually will" are miles apart. The fact that most results in [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439293/) show that complications such as infections from bad hygiene are far more frequent amongst uncircumcised males, proves this.
1.1.7.6.3.4.3.1. Con: Brian Morris is unreliable and biased.
1.1.7.6.3.4.3.1.1. Pro: Morris is connected to groups that sexualise circumcision, including the Gilgal Society: a group with a history of child pornography and that had its website shut down.  [Vernon G. Quaintance](http://intactwiki.org/wiki/Vernon_G._Quaintance), one of its main founders, has been convicted for sexual misconduct multiple times.

[circumstitions.com](http://www.circumstitions.com/morris.html)
1.1.7.6.3.4.3.1.2. Pro: Morris' work has been criticized for misquoting other studies and citing his own sources.

[skeptic.org.uk](https://www.skeptic.org.uk/magazine/onlinearticles/infant-circumcision/)
1.1.7.6.3.4.3.1.3. Pro: Morris is a molecular biologist, which is not a relevant field when it comes to circumcision. 

[Morris' website](http://www.circinfo.net/about_the_author_professor_brian_j_morris.html)
1.1.7.6.3.4.3.2. Con: It is irrelevant if the alternate options to circumcision will be used or not, their existence as viable alternatives is sufficient to replace circumcision if it were banned.
1.1.7.7. Con: With the use of proper sterile surgical technique, complications [can be prevented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253617/).
1.1.7.7.1. Con: The chance of complications, even with proper sterile surgical technique, is higher compared to never preforming the procedure.
1.1.8. Con: When it comes to any procedure “safe” takes a backseat to “necessary”.
1.1.8.1. Con: Many religions require circumcision.
1.1.8.1.1. Con: Religions \(or some sects thereof\) call for murders too, but that doesn't make it either legal, or acceptable.
1.1.8.1.2. Con: When the child is old enough to decide for a religion, it can have one.
1.1.8.1.2.1. Pro: The choice to circumcise is not a religious right. The choice to be circumcised is a religious right. As such, the consent and decision must come from the person that is being circumcised, not their parents, community or anyone else.
1.1.8.1.3. Con: The mere fact of a religion requiring a behavior is not sufficient to justify that behavior.
1.1.8.1.4. Con: Gods are imaginary.
1.1.8.1.4.1. Pro: There is no evidence that gods exist.
1.1.8.1.4.2. Con: -> See discussion #2629: [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theism) exists.
1.1.8.1.5. Pro: If people have their own convictions, based on prophetical words/utterances of God, then they have the right and/or moral duty, according to their faith, to obey the instructions of God.
1.1.8.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.4.
1.1.8.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.1.
1.1.8.1.7. Con: The Catholic Church [has condemned](https://www.catholicdoors.com/faq/qu340.htm) religious circumcision for its members. It prohibits circumcision performed as a condition of becoming a Catholic or to be saved.
1.1.8.1.7.1. Con: Despite this, circumcision is [common](http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/jc1360_male_circumcision_en_0.pdf) in predominantly Christian countries such as the US, the Philippines, Canada and parts of the Oceania, and also among Christian communities in countries such as South Korea and in the Middle East.
1.1.8.1.7.1.1. Con: This is an [argument from popularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum), just because something is common does not necessarily mean it should continue.
1.1.8.1.7.2. Con: Committed Catholics will choose not to circumcise if that is their belief. This has no bearing on the rights of other religious groups to follow the accepted cultural and religious practice of their religion.
1.1.8.1.7.2.1. Con: 'Not being circumcized' is reversible. A person can always choose to get circumcized at a later age. Many people who convert to Judaism or Islam have it done as adults.
1.1.8.1.7.2.1.1. Con: 'Not being circumcised from birth' is irreversible.
1.1.8.1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: The irreversibility of a surgical procedure on a traditionally very private part of the body versus the irreverisibility of not being something from birth but only at later age is hardly comparable.
1.1.8.1.7.2.2. Con: The example demonstrates how religious beliefs can be easily changed and modernised.
1.1.8.1.7.2.2.1. Con: The removal of circumcision as a tenet of Christian belief was the subject of a centuries long [controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision_controversy_in_early_Christianity). This can hardly be described as an "easy" process.
1.1.8.1.7.2.2.2. Con: The ease in which a belief is changed depends on the depth of which that belief is held to a person or group. It cannot therefore be easy in absolute terms.
1.1.8.1.8. Pro: Circumcision is an [important part](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43749/9789241596169_eng.pdf;jsessionid=66D253E0CB078B899264D0B7DA91EC92?sequence=1) \(p. 3\) of religious practice in Judaism and Islam, acting as a confirmation of a relationship with God. Therefore, it is almost universally practised among adherents of these faiths.
1.1.8.1.8.1. Pro: The Islamic rite of khitan \(circumcision\) is a religious-cultural sign of [belonging](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml) to the Muslim community.
1.1.8.1.8.1.1. Con: The Qur'an [does not mention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_\(circumcision\)) circumcision.
1.1.8.1.8.1.2. Pro: Some hadith and the [Sunnah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah) [describe circumcision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_\(circumcision\)) as a desirable or sometimes even as a necessary practice.
1.1.8.1.8.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.1.2.
1.1.8.1.8.1.4. Pro: Not being circumcised at birth or at an early age could cause social problems for the individual in a conservative Muslim or Jewish community or in some countries/cultures even if they are not that conservative.
1.1.8.1.8.1.4.1. Pro: The child can be made fun of by peers and even adults, he may be seen as not-fully Muslim/Jewish by the community, in adulthood he may even not be let to marry.
1.1.8.1.8.1.5. Pro: According to Hanefii and Malikii sects circumcision is [sunnah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah). According to Shafii and Hanbelii sects it is [wajib or even fard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fard). 
Even if it is sunnah and is not in the Holy Quran, sunnah is not an insignificant source of information. We learn many significant details about the pillars of Islam \(like [salah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah) and [sawm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting_in_Islam)\) and more from sunnah. 
The Holy Quran says, "[And](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=59&verse=7) whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from."
1.1.8.1.8.2. Con: The idea that cutting a piece of a child's penis off connects them in some way to a God is wildly unreasonable, illogical, inappropriate and could even be considered dangerous.
1.1.8.1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.1.1.
1.1.8.1.8.4. Con: An infant cannot have a relationship with God, because he does not possess the capacity to understand the concept of God, regardless of his parents beliefs.
1.1.8.1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.4.
1.1.8.1.8.6. Pro: It is the primary symbol of a Jew's covenant with God. Banning circumcision is the equivalent of banning Jews.
1.1.8.1.8.6.1. Pro: Such a ban in one country might simply impel Jews to move to a country in which it is allowed, and could amount to 'constructive expulsion', of the very infants the ban is intended to protect. This might not be beneficial to the infant's future wellbeing and do more harm than good.
1.1.8.1.8.6.2. Con: Society has banned religious behavior historically, that it has found objectionable. Discrimination, slavery, religious abuse and executions, FGM... yet affected religions still find ways to exist within society.
1.1.8.1.8.6.3. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.4.
1.1.8.1.8.6.4. Pro: The mark of a Jewish man, according to the Torah, is circumcision [\(Genesis 17:10-12\)](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/bereishit-genesis-chapter-17). Since one is considered Jewish by the circumstances of one's birth, autonomy doesn't enter the equation.
1.1.8.1.8.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.7.2.1.
1.1.8.1.8.6.4.2. Con: There is no principled, non-arbitrary line between parental responsibility and the individual's freedom and autonomy. Without limits, this argument leads to absurd consequences, as it would approve parents volunteering their children for martyrdom for religious reasons.
1.1.8.1.8.6.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.1.2.
1.1.8.1.8.6.5. Pro: Circumcision marks a Jewish child as one of God's chosen, meaning the decision to not circumcise would have risks involved. Even if the risks are merely perceived, they cannot be overlooked.
1.1.8.1.8.6.5.1. Pro: It is imperative above all else to keep oneself and one's family acceptable in the eyes of one's god\(s\).
Being acceptable to God \(or Allah, or Vishnu, etc.\) is paramount, since it has to do with your eternal existence, rather than this temporal existence. Circumcision is important because it allows Jews to be acceptable in the eyes of God, and Muslims to be acceptable to Allah.
1.1.8.1.8.6.5.1.1. Con: Someone's concerns should not be considered when they are opting for elective surgery on behalf of another. The welfare of the patient should be the primary concern. As the patient is not of sufficient age to elect to a surgery, they cannot be allowed to perform it.
1.1.8.1.8.6.5.1.2. Con: If one god forbids a child from entering heaven, another may forbid them from entering heaven if their body is unnecessarily mutilated.
1.1.8.1.8.6.5.2. Con: The unsustained perceived risk of being condemned by god for not removing part of a boy's penis is not equivalent to the genuine risk of the unnecessary operation.
1.1.8.1.8.6.5.3. Con: There is no such thing as a spiritual threat, there cannot be a spiritual threat, it's an unfalsifiable claim.
1.1.8.1.8.6.6. Con: Banning outdated practices doesn't ban Jews, many laws of the Torah are not observed but people are still Jews.
1.1.8.1.8.7. Con: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.1.2.
1.1.8.1.8.8. Pro: In Judaism, [performing circumcision](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.0830s1017.x) on the eighth day after birth is a mitzvah \(a commandment\) termed Brit Milah \(the covenant of circumcision\). This originates with the story of Abraham in Genesis \(17:10-14\), and the laws governing the procedure are also detailed in the Talmud.
1.1.8.1.8.8.1. Con: There are many religions whose foundation is relatively recent and well documented. \(E.g. Baha'i, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, etc.\) Just as easily as justifying a surgical procedure through a religion, the prohibition thereof could also be canonised in a newly founded religion. Thus, it is inconsistent to apply religious law to surgical procedures.
1.1.8.1.9. Con: Circumcision is not required for religious reasons by Christian parents since it has been replaced by Baptism or at least it is not required, in the view of [Reformed Scholars](https://heidelblog.net/2012/09/baptism-and-circumcision-according-to-colossians-211-12/).
1.1.8.1.9.1. Con: Christians don't require circumcision according to the judgement at the Council of Jerusalem, as described in the [15th chapter](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+15&version=nrsva) of The Acts of the Apostles. "Reformed Scholars" have had nothing to do with this.
1.1.8.1.10. Pro: Infant circumcision means that an adult doesn't have to get circumsized when marrying a spouse from a pious Muslim or Jewish family.
1.1.8.1.10.1. Con: Preemptively circumcising everyone with the idea that they won't have to be circumcised later if they decide to marry into certain families seems like a very badly thought out idea. By the same logic, we should also start to baptise everyone on the possibility that they marry into Christian family, feed them only food that is halal and kosher and Hinduists approve, because what if.. And the list goes on.
1.1.8.1.10.2. Con: Unlike an adult, a small child cannot understand the implications of circumcision, and is therefore incapable of consenting to the procedure.
1.1.8.1.10.2.1. Con: There are lots of things that kids don't like that are good for them and their parents make decisions on their behalves.
1.1.8.1.10.2.2. Pro: There are no clear benefits for doing circumcision sooner and there are considerable benefits when it comes to personal freedom of self-determination if the circumcision is to be done with adult's consent.
1.1.8.1.10.2.3. Pro: Keeping your child intact allows him the right to choose what he believes is best for him as an adult.
1.1.8.1.10.2.4. Pro: Non-medical surgeries should only be received by consenting adults.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5. Con: Forcing someone to ingest vegetables violates bodily autonomy as it forces someone to do something that affects their body without consent. Yet parents are able to do this all the time due to the health benefits associated with eating vegetables; the same is true of circumcision.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1. Pro: There are positive medical benefits to circumcision.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.1. Con: Religious traditions established circumcision for a reason. It is possible that in the hot climate regions where this custom originated and took hold the circumcision prevented infections. If that is indeed the case, in today's first world societies with daily showers, good hygiene and better access to medical care this benefit has outlived itself.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.2. Con: The foreskin has [several](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreskin#Functions) [functions](http://foreskinfunction.org/) all of which are lost when it is removed.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.2.2. Con: Most of these "functions" are based on its ability to prevent types of infections - [though, circumcised males are generally less exposed to penile infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439293/). So the "functions" are more like 'worse versions of the same functions as those of circumcised penises', which makes this argument irrelevant.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.4.3.1.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.3. Con: The argument is valid only if the benefits outweigh the damage and risks.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4. Pro: Circumcision [reduces](http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/8/853) the risk of urinary tract infection in boys.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.1. Con: Proper hygiene provides the same result.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.2. Con: Urinary tract infections are usually [not serious](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/tc/urinary-tract-infections-in-teens-and-adults-topic-overview#1) if treated promptly. This is not a large enough medical benefit to justify circumcision.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.3. Con: The risk of UTIs in uncircumcised men and boys is [already sufficiently low](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320872.php).
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.3.1. Con: The risk of UTI in uncircumcised men [increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23201382) as they get older.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.3.1.1. Con: If a man wishes to get circumcised to prevent future UTIs, that is perfectly fine. Permanent surgical interventions should not be used to prevent minor infections.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.4. Con: If we removed the breasts of all pubescent girls that would eliminate breast cancer too. Just because a surgical procedure may reduce the risk of some potential illness in the future does not justify forcing it on people now.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.4.1. Con: Removing the breast to prevent breast cancer would be akin to removing the whole penis to prevent UTI. Circumcision only removes the foreskin, and therefore cannot be equally compared.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.4.1.1. Con: Having a foreskin [does carry](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/spr08halperin/) a higher risk of infection over not carrying one. The example does work in this context.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.4.1.2. Con: Breast tissues are non-vital in the same way that the foreskin is considered 'non-vital' and breast cancer is a very serious threat, more so than UTIs. The argument follows.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.4.1.2.1. Con: Breast tissue is essential for lactation, so even if not vital, its lack presents limitations to biological function. The absence of foreskin doesn't involve loss of any function.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.4.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.2.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.4.1.3. Con: The comparison illustrates the bad ethics of non-consensual, speculative surgery for possible ailments that have not yet happened. We don't force everyone to undergo an appendectomy before they might get appendicitis. The same should be true for any foreskin ailments.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.5. Con: The conclusion of the study states that benefits outweigh risks in boys predisposed to UTIs, not all boys.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.5. Con: Throughout history, circumcision research, just like research on cadavers, women’s reproduction, and many other areas of biology, have been tainted by religion and the bias that comes with it.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.4.2.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.7. Con: It is unfair to the individual receiving an irreversible bodily modification such as circumcision to base the decision to perform it on the uncertainty of medical hypotheses about the impact it has.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.4.2.3.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.9. Con: Ritual circumcision [was linked to](https://www.rsm.ac.uk/about-us/media-information/2015-media-releases/ritual-circumcision-linked-to-increased-risk-of-autism-in-young-boys.aspx) increased risk of autism in young boys.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.10. Con: The person should decide for themselves whether those benefits are worthwhile when they are old enough to make an informed decision.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.11. Con: The supposed benefits of circumcision can usually be achieved non-surgically through education, good personal hygiene and the use of condoms.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.11.1. Con: Randomized trials have demonstrated that voluntary medical male circumcision reduces risk of HIV acquisition beyond that offered by good hygiene and condom usage alone.[Summary of 3 VMMC trials.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-1293.2008.00596.x)
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.11.1.1. Con: The study cited here was done only in Sub-Saharan Africa, so the results are not representative of the Western world.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.11.2. Pro: By the time a boy is old enough to know whether these methods are effective for him, he will also be old enough to decide whether or not circumcision is the best option himself.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.11.2.1. Pro: If circumcision's benefits to the male in question are indeed great enough to warrant the risks, then there is no reason an adult male would not choose to do so. If they are not, then that male should be consulted before performing the procedure without consent.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.11.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.3.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.4.3.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.12. Pro: [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5065403/) have found that adult men who have been circumcised may have a more positive body image, and sexual health.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.12.1. Con: The study linked shows a correlation only. There is no evidence of a causal effect of circumcision on body image and sexual health.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.12.2. Con: Any benefits of circumcision on adult men have no bearing on the ethics of forcibly circumcising infants.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.12.3. Con: How you view your body is completely subjective and depends on cultural standards.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.12.4. Pro: Circumcision is considered far more [aesthetically pleasing](http://www.gentlecircumcision.com/circumcision-women-prefer/) to many men and their partners and they should not be forced to live with embarrassment of non-circumcision.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.12.4.1. Con: No man is "forced to live with the embarrassment of non-circumcision", adult circumcision is an option for men who wish they had been circumcised.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.12.4.2. Con: It is not considered to be embarrasing in countries where circumcision is not the norm.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.12.4.3. Con: Foot binding was a status symbol and aesthetically pleasing in China for almost 1000 years. Cultural norms and aesthetic tastes can be immoral, as genital mutilation \(both female and male\) clearly shows.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.13. Pro: Since there are medical benefits, then the surgery can be considered preventative, and therefore necessary.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.13.1. Con: Not all preventative surgeries are medically necessary. Castrating infant males to eliminate the risk of testicular cancer could also be considered a preventative surgery, however, the fact that castration would prevent testicular cancer is not sufficient reason by itself to perform the surgery.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.13.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.4.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.14. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15. Pro: Circumcision can [greatly reduce](https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/HivCircumcision.html) a man's risk of contracting HIV.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.1. Con: The owner of the penis can decide to have the procedure performed as an adult before becoming sexually active. It need not be performed on an infant who will not contract HIV through sexual activity.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.2. Pro: The inner surface of the foreskin contains a high concentration of Langerhans' cells which serve as the primary point of viral entry in an uncircumcised man. Removing these reduces HIV acquisition risk. [Mechanisms of protection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127372/)
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.3. Con: This gives men a false sense of safety and is irrelevant, as men should still be using condoms.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.3.1. Pro: There is still a substantial chance of contracting HIV, even when circumcised, thus even circumcised men shouldn't have unprotected sex.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.3.2. Pro: If men were to have unprotected sex, because they themselves consider themselves in a safer position, women would still be at risk when having sex with HIV-positive men. So condoms should still be used, as even circumcised men can contract HIV.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.3.3. Pro: Circumcised men being less likely to contract HIV will lead to women having to argue more about wanting to using protection during sex and will thus lead to less protected sex, when men are able to get their will, which is bad for public health.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.3.4. Pro: Even if the risk of HIV contraction is lower, there are still plenty of [diseases](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44777938) that men should protect themselves of.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.3.4.1. Con: Adult male circumcision [does not reduce](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/200/3/370/900692) the risk of incident Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, or Trichomonas vaginalis infection.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.4. Con: Circumcision surgery can give you HIV if sanitary conditions are not met. You can contract HIV if you get a surgery where your blood is in contact with instruments that have been contaminated \(especially if these instruments were already used to operate on other patients who have HIV\).
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.5. Con: This causality claim is unwarranted \(and exaggerated\), because the [study](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001509) is flawed. The lower HIV-rates among circumcised participants might as well be due to their higher condom usage \(which the study promoted\), and/or due to their lower amount of sexual partners, and/or other uncontrolled factors. As such, the study only shows 'correlations', not that circumcision is 'causally related' to lower HIV rates, especially not "greatly" reducing it.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.5.1. Con: This claim minimizes the strength of evidence by referencing only one of three large randomized trials demonstrating the efficacy of voluntary medical male circumcision to prevent HIV acquisition. [All 3 are summarized here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-1293.2008.00596.x)
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.6. Con: A reduction of the risk in HIV transmission is irrelevant when more effective methods exist that don't involve performing permanent unnecessary surgical interventions on infants.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.6.1. Con: Methods for preventing the spread of HIV, such as condoms and the drug [PrEP](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/prep.html), often incur recurring cost of reasonably large amounts. While perhaps feasible for the developed world, individuals in the developing world may not have consistent access to such prevention methods. Circumcision is a viable option in these instances.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.6.1.1. Con: Male condom provision, interventions with sex workers and other methods have been shown to be [cost effective](http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=kb-08-01-04#S5.1X) methods of reducing the spread of HIV, even in the developing world.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.6.1.2. Con: If an intact adult male would like to reduce his risk of HIV he can opt to have a circumcision for the same cost. This would achieve the same goal without violating the consent of the man.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.6.1.3. Con: Infants do not have sex and do not need protection from sexually transmitted HIV.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.7. Con: Reducing the risk of contracting HIV by means of circumcision may be a relevant medical benefit in countries with rampant infection rates. In countries with low infection rates and therefore low inherent risk of exposure, the medical benefit of the procedure becomes negligible.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.8. Con: The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the United States, where most men are circumcised, is [2-6 times higher](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/morten-frisch/time-for-us-parents-to-reconsider-the-acceptability-of-infant-male-circumcision_b_7031972.html) than in non-circumcising countries of Northern Europe.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.16. Con: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.17. Con: Medical benefits is totally not the same as medical necessity and when it comes to infants necessity is what matters.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.17.1. Con: In the case of vaccines, medical benefits - rather than necessity - are sufficient.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.17.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.3.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.18. Pro: Circumcision [reduces the risk of HPV infection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22676057) and therefore decreases the risk of related diseases \(genital warts, genital cancers in both sexes, oropharyngeal carcinoma etc.\).
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.18.1. Con: This study only refers to the subgroup of HIV infected men. If there is a medical benefit for this group, there is no reason to put every child under the knife. You could restrict the procedure to men who have been infected if the study concludes benefits outweigh risks.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.18.2. Con: Circumcised men are [at twice the risk](https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/stds/news/online/%7Bee2769c4-b9b0-4daa-8eef-943c7205ed6c%7D/circumcised-men-at-twice-the-risk-for-cancer-causing-hpv-study-shows) for cancer-causing HPV.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.2. Con: Eating veggies is not same as removing a part of the body.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.2.1. Con: Nobody said it was exactly the same action. But forcing a child to follow a strict vegan diet can greatly limit the growth of a child and affect its life far more than a circumcision.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.2.1.1. Con: There have been many cases worldwide of parents being prosecuted for neglect forcing a vegan diet on their child. Meanwhile, parents of children who died from circumcision are usually not prosecuted. Cases in [Belgium](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/baby-dies-diet-parents-convicted-lucas-dendermonde-belgium-malnutrition-dehydration-a7790916.html), [Australia](https://www.marieclaire.com.au/sydney-couple-charged-malnourished-baby-vegan-diet) and [France](https://www.vegan-momma.com/vegan-baby-death.html).
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.2.1.2. Con: The parent claim was about eating vegetables, not about eating 'nothing but' vegetables. A strict vegan diet is not the same or even remotely similar to eating vegetables in addition to other food sources.
1.1.8.1.10.2.5.2.1.3. Con: Eating a certain amount of vegetables is healthy and probably even necessary. A strict vegan diet is very difficult or maybe even impossible to follow in a healthy way.
1.1.9. Pro: When performed by a medical professional, possible complications from circumcision are on par with non-circumcision. Clinically, it's zero sum. The question to circumcise then becomes an expression of one's beliefs. Whether the belief is rooted in religion, culture or familial traditions; neither government nor public opinion should have any authority.
1.1.9.1. Con: The government is mandated to intervene in some cases, like child abuse or neglect. Unnecessary surgery could be added to the list, especially when it includes the removal of a functional organ.
1.1.9.2. Con: The question to circumcise then indeed becomes an expression of one's beliefs. It is, however, expression of one's beliefs on someone else's body. Everyone has the right to be circumcised, but everyone should be able to choose to do so on his own.
1.1.9.2.1. Con: The term belief is equivocated by claiming a religious/societal belief is on par with a medical/scientific "belief". This is not the case and in the realm of reason and public policy, medical and scientific findings reign supreme over religious and other beliefs \(i.e. opinions\).
1.1.9.3. Con: Even when perfectly performed, circumcision can still leave the individual with [complications](https://med.stanford.edu/newborns/professional-education/circumcision/complications.html).
1.2. Pro: In case of religiously motivated circumcision, it is unacceptable for the parents to leave a permanent, lifelong sign of their own religious affiliation on the child's body.
1.2.1. Con: It may be a religious practice but once done will have no negative bearing on your life. If a person chooses later in life to turn away from their parents' religious beliefs, their circumcision should have very little impact on their life.
1.2.1.1. Con: Pain, trauma and bleeding, especially immediately after birth, are negative. It is an unwarranted assumption that such things will have no negative bearing on life.
1.2.1.2. Con: While they can turn away from their parents' religious beliefs, they can't grow back their foreskin. Meanwhile an uncircumcised child can always get himself circumcised later if he chooses to follow his parents' religion when he is old enough to make an informed choice.
1.2.2. Con: The child literally belongs to the parent/parents, not the state because it was not the state that produced it.
1.2.2.1. Con: The state has a duty of care to protect children from their parents if society believes it is justified.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The state can still intervene when the parents' wishes are determined not to be in the child's best interests.
1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.
1.2.2.1.1.2. Con: The extent of state powers can become a concern. A ban on circumcision opens the door to political interference on principles, culture, tradition, norms and values. This could spiral out of the control as the politicians might use legislative tools for personal goals.
1.2.2.1.1.3. Con: This could result in the gross overreach of the government, costing a child his life, [as recently occurred in the UK](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/28/health/alfie-evans-british-toddler-dies-intl/index.html). [Twice.](https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/06/health/charlie-gard-us-laws/index.html)
1.2.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Both Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans were already terminally ill, and the courses of treatment desired by the parents would not have made any difference to this. They are, in fact, the perfect example of the need for state oversight of the medical \(or, in this case, surgical\) decisions made by parents on behalf of their children.
1.2.2.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: Parents make many decisions for their children's emotional, spiritual and physical health. Most are well-intentioned. Having government micro-manage parenting is bad precedent.
1.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Well intentioned decisions are not necessarily good decisions.
1.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Female genital mutilation is also considered as well-intended by the people exposing their daughters to this procedure.
1.2.2.2. Con: Children do not "belong" to their parents and have independent rights for protection, safety and self-determination.
1.2.2.3. Con: The claim implies a false dilemma. Children - just as any other human beings - are not in possession either of the parents, or the state, or of any other subject or entity.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Parents have the privilege of loving and guiding the child to independence, at which time the child determines its own future.
1.2.3. Con: Circumcision is well within the authority of a parent.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Every parent is responsible for the spiritual and mental education and wellbeing of his/her child. Therefore, they have to make choices according to their knowledge, belief or conviction, until the time that the child is mature enough to make own decisions.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: The child can never get the body part back! The decision can NOT be undone by the child.
1.2.3.2. Con: Nobody should ever be allowed to perform unnecessary surgery on a child, religion is irrelevant. It is a matter of child protection.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: Altering the body and altering the mind of a child, based on a religious doctrine, can be seen by some as morally equivalent. If we condone one, we should also condone the other.
1.2.3.2.2. Con: The definition of "unnecessary" would be dependent on what the parent or caregiver decides.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Pro: A heel stick on a newborn is done without the baby's consent because the caregiver deems it appropriate and necessary. A religious person would say that a ritual designed to safeguard an element of the soul is as valid as a medical procedure designed to safeguard the body.
1.2.3.2.2.1.1. Con: The difference here is there is evidence for the legitimacy of medical practices. Religious practices are not reinforced by evidence.
1.2.3.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Estimation, and a lack of accurate information prevents governments from regulating potentially dangerous religious practices like [faith healing](https://www.alternet.org/belief/shocking-numbers-children-die-america-when-their-parents-turn-faith-based-healing).
1.2.3.2.2.2. Con: A parent or caregiver is not necessarily qualified to decide what is best for a child. On the contrary, what they think is best can be tantamount to abuse.
1.2.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Some parents choose to follow [religious practices](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/02/us-daughter-pray-death) instead of sound medical advice.
1.2.3.2.2.2.2. Pro: Misinformation leading parents to choose not to vaccinate their children against medical advice has lead to [out-breaks of since eradicated diseases and even deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_controversies#Events_following_reductions_in_vaccination).
1.2.3.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Vaccines increase risk of [autoimmune disorders](http://healthimpactnews.com/2012/autoimmune-disorders-caused-by-vaccines/) and other complications. This means that there is a risk assessment that cannot be overlooked as parents wrestle with the decision to administer or not.
1.2.3.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.3.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3. Pro: As circumcision is an elective surgery and a parent choice, every [death as a result of an elective circumcision](http://www.cirp.org/library/death/) is avoidable.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1. Con: Many religious people would contend that circumcision is not elective.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.1. Con: There is a big difference between "sharing your religious beliefs" and carving them into the flesh of an infant. If the parent's religion demanded that the child's eyes be sacrificed to their god we would not allow that. One's right to practice a religion has boundaries that stop at injuring another person's body.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Cultural and religious beliefs vary considerably across the globe, and therefore so do the boundaries. What one group sees as injurious, another may see as a rite of passage.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Neck rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_ring), for example, worn in certain African and Asian cultures can be considered dangerous or 'wrong' in Western culture. However, it is an age-old practice steeped in tradition that is shared over generations.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Slavery is also an "age-old practice steeped in tradition that is shared over generations". It is still wrong. Appeals to tradition do not demonstrate ethical righteousness.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The biggest flaw in this argument is that slavery is not mandated by religious tenet in modern religions.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Religious mandate does not determine ethical righteousness. If it did then one could argue that witch burnings \(which were at one point mandated by the modern religion\) were ethical. Clearly, they were not; both now and then.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.2. Con: This argument could also be used to justify female genital mutilation, something that is commonly considered morally reprehensible.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Female circumcision is different to male circumcision because the intention is to suppress female sexual arousal. Suppressing female sexuality is an extreme form of religious based sexism. A women is considered a chattel and not a person.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.2. Con: If a religion mandated that male children must be given facial tattoos, then it would not be considered clearly unethical.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: Just as requiring girls to cover their faces or boys to wear a turban is seen as good by some and bad by others, this too would be a debatable point.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Garments are not permanent surgical alteration. If one's religion mandated that infants be lobotomized at birth there is no amount of ethical relativism that could absolve the horrific repugnance of this act. Forcing a baby to cover its face is no comparison.
1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.2.2. Con: Tattooing one's child face could be claimed a religious edict too, and thus as justifiable as circumcision.
1.2.3.2.2.2.4. Con: But saying they are not "necessarily" qualified is only an argument for the fact that there is no guarantee that every parent or guardian is perfectly qualified for knowing what's best for their child - not that circumcision in general isn't what's best for the child.
1.2.3.2.2.2.4.1. Con: The inability of certain parents to make the right decision for their child means that they are not fit to make an unnecessary one.
1.2.3.2.2.3. Con: Regarding surgeries, the definition of "necessary" is only dependent on what medical experts decide.
1.2.3.2.2.3.1. Con: In case of religion, the definition of "necessary" is only dependent on what religious experts decide \(or what may be written in the holy texts\).  It would be logical to say that the religious definition is more relevant than the medical, in the context of religious acts.
1.2.3.2.2.3.2. Con: Theoretically, no surgery is "necessary" because there is always a choice not to do a surgery.
1.2.3.2.2.3.3. Con: What constitutes "necessary" is a matter of opinion. Necessary could be defined in various ways, such as   "necessary to prevent immediate death", or "having the effect of improving quality of life."
1.2.3.2.3. Con: It cannot be stated that religion is irrelevant since this is a religious matter. That is not to say that it is not also a matter of child protection - but it cannot be said that one matter is more important than the other.
1.2.3.2.3.1. Con: The same way that cult procedures involving mutilation are seen as a threat to the child so should more common religious procedures be seen as such.
1.2.3.2.3.2. Con: Child protection is definitely more important than religious matters. If it weren't then it would be acceptable to allow cult leaders to have sex with the children in the cult \(as they are often known to do\). Religious matters always take a back seat to child protection.
1.2.3.2.3.2.1. Con: Religious matters span over an enormous area. One example of a 'religious' matter can't represent all religious matters, since many religious acts are meant to do good and to help the person the act is aimed at. Cult leaders having sex with children is certainly not considered as an act done to help the child. Circumcision is.
1.2.3.2.3.2.1.1. Con: The practice of circumcision does not always arise with the wellbeing of the child in mind. For example, Dr. Kellogg advocated for circumcision for reasons that would now be considered psychologically unhealthy.

[John Harvey Kellogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg#Masturbation_prevention)
1.2.3.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Then people like this shouldn't be allowed to circumcise their child.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Parents have the responsibility \(among others\) to protect their children from spiritual threats. A ban on circumcision may present just such a threat, as seen through the lens of their religion. This responsibility gives them the authority to act in the interest of their child as they deem necessary.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.6.4.2.
1.2.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.6.5.3.
1.2.3.3.3. Con: If this reasoning were valid then witches should be allowed to tattoo protective spells over the entirety of their infant children's skin in order to protect them from spiritual threats. Clearly that would be an overreach of parental authority, as is infant circumcision.
1.2.3.3.3.1. Con: Very few people would claim that those tattoos contributed to their life, while circumcision actually has the vast majority of circumcised men satisfied with them having it done while they were infant.
1.2.3.3.3.1.1. Con: Given that it is [common](http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/) for people to show signs of denial when harm was done to them, it isn't self-evident that these people would be in denial about the benefits of these tattoos either.
1.2.3.3.4. Con: Religions do not make the claim that the intention of circumcision is to protect against spiritual threats.
1.2.3.3.5. Pro: Banning circumcision could lead to real supernatural punishment from God.
1.2.3.3.5.1. Con: This argument can never hold any weight because anyone can claim to know God's mind and threaten God's wrath if God's commandments are disobeyed.
1.2.3.3.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.1.2.
1.2.3.3.5.2. Con: The [existence of a divine power](https://www.kialo.com/the-existence-of-god-2629) is controversial at best.
1.2.3.3.5.3. Con: God has not explicitly given any punishment due to uncircumcised children in recent history.
1.2.3.3.5.4. Pro: Regardless of whether or not this punishment is tangible or the harms quantifiable, the perception that they may exist will negatively impact the quality of life of those who hold these beliefs.
1.2.3.3.5.4.1. Con: This can be used to describe a lot of regressive religious practices and does not mean that governments or society at large should endorse those beliefs.
1.2.3.3.5.4.1.1. Con: "Regressive" used to describe a religious practice cannot assume atheism. In this case, God commands it, so circumcision is progressive not regressive.
1.2.3.3.5.4.1.2. Con: If it indeed has a negative impact that outweighs the negativeness of the alternative, then there is no reason those beliefs shouldn't be endorsed.
1.2.4. Con: Traditions and religious beliefs when prohibited by a discriminatory law lead to extremism.
1.2.4.1. Con: We should not allow the threat of violence prevent us from trying to improve our society.
1.2.4.2. Con: Permanent bodily damage, especially to infants, is against the law and while belief groups may have rules themselves, no one can be persecuted for not following these rules if they themselves don't feel like doing so. An infant is unable to make this choice for themselves so it shouldn't be forced upon them. If the law is against bodily damage of any kind and this law is violated by a belief group, it can't be discriminatory. Any extremist action taken on behalf of this group is outright stupid.
1.2.4.3. Con: Cutting pieces of body from somebody who cannot prevent it is extremism of its own.
1.2.4.4. Pro: A ban on circumcision might lead to violent clashes of people or religions and cultures or nations.
1.2.4.4.1. Con: Fear of violence should not dictate ethics.
1.2.5. Pro: If a new sect were to prescribe the surgical removal of another part of a child’s body, say an ear, to please a god or leader, there would be unequivocal condemnation and the practise would be outlawed immediately.
1.2.5.1. Con: To base a law on possible extreme situations is an unreasonable presumption.
1.2.5.1.1. Con: There are many people who would classify the mutilation of someone's genitals without permission as an 'extreme situation' so the law should not be asked to judge the validity of one form of mutilation over another when it has the choice of simply outlawing all mutilation.
1.2.5.2. Con: What if a new religion required piercing of ears, which is another invasive procedure that breaks the skin and wounds. There would not be the same level of outrage as this is a norm. Perhaps the condemnation or outrage only stems from how alien the procedure is to us at a given period in time. And removal of a body part would be accepted if it was a norm.
1.2.5.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.2.
1.2.6. Pro: An infant cannot automatically accept the religion of its parents, and therefore should not be subjected to a body modification solely for this reason.
1.2.6.1. Con: What a child is fed and what activities are allowed also modifies the child's body permanently. Allowing a child to choose is neglectful parenting.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: A child is incapable of feeding itself and a parent is, therefore, obliged to make decisions on behalf of that child as the alternative \(not feeding the child\) would result in the death of that child. The same is not true of circumcision, so this is false analogy.
1.2.6.2. Con: This argument assumes that autonomy is more important than religious identity. Religions that make the argument for circumcision assume the opposite. This argument is only viable when there is some intersection between religious 'responsibility' and bodily autonomy.
1.2.6.2.1. Con: But the point is that the religious identity in question is that of the parents, not of the person whose body is to be modified / mutilated.
1.2.6.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.
1.2.6.2.2. Con: Bodily integrity is included in the universal human rights. Aside from countries that do not recognize these in the first place, circumcision is still practiced in countries that do recognize them.
1.2.6.2.3. Con: An infant has no religious identity to pit against their right to bodily autonomy, and a child is in no position to give informed consent to joining a religion \(which, by the way, is almost invariably that of his/her parents...\). There might be an analogy between sex and religion: without sufficient maturity and independence one cannot meaningfully and validly consent to either \(despite the fact that both choices can be important parts of one's identity\).
1.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.2.1.
1.2.8. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.
1.2.9. Con: All parents pass on their beliefs to their children psychologically, whether intentionally or not. Circumcision is a minor matter in comparison.
1.2.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.1.
1.2.10. Pro: During WW2, the Nazis sometimes relied on circumcision to identify male Jews. Although not as effective now as a indicator of religion amongst most Western nations, it could still be used for discrimination.
1.2.10.1. Con: Attempting to prevent discrimination by forcing the victim to change whatever makes him different is discriminative in itself. An example would be forcing a homosexual person to pretend they are heterosexual in order to stop being discriminated against, which defeats the whole purpose.
1.2.11. Con: In case of religiously motivated circumcision, it is acceptable for the parent to leave a permanent, lifelong sign of their own religious affiliation on the child's body.
1.2.11.1. Pro: Banning male circumcision violates a person's religious right to have been part of an important ritual from birth, which is irreversible once they've grown to adulthood.
1.2.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.7.2.1.
1.2.11.1.2. Con: There's no such thing as a "right to have been part of an important ritual from birth" because no law or social pact has ever agreed on or recognized the existence of a right to have been part of a ritual from birth and, thus, that right has never come to existence.
1.2.11.1.3. Con: A "right" is something you're enabled to execute if you decide to, not something that is forced onto you. A baby has no way of deciding whether it wants to use this right or not.
1.2.11.1.4. Con: This is a petitio, it begs the question: society will certainly not endorse every religious ritual as a personal right. Some rituals are immoral and should be banned. Circumcision is such a ritual.
1.2.11.1.5. Pro: While we might want to be someone different, we do not get a choice and have to live with the provided circumstances, many of which come from our parents. Circumcision is just a part of the circumstances provided, that make up a person.
1.2.11.1.6. Con: This right should have to be really specific to be relevant to this argument, because we do participate in a lot of rituals from birth throughout our lives, but not all of them are Jewish rituals.
1.2.11.1.7. Con: “...which is irreversible...” Circumcision is also irreversible. This is not speaking of the infants religious right, this is speaking of the parents and religious leaders rights. An infant has no concept of religion...an infant has no concept of anything except sleep, eat, poop, pee, cry. This is out of fear and shame to face the religious community with “I am waiting until he is old enough to decide for himself.”
1.2.11.1.7.1. Con: An infant will grow into adulthood where he can regret that his parents didn't perform the ritual on him when he was an infant, so he could grow up being circumcised etc. Point is, that it isn't relevant to say that an infant cannot have a concept of this, because by the time it does, it may be too late.
1.2.11.1.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.7.2.1.
1.2.11.2. Con: This position expressly negates the individual’s freedom of conscience and religion, because it allows somebody else to make a religious decision for you at an age when you cannot give or deny consent.
1.2.11.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.1.1.
1.2.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.3. Con: Foreskins removed in circumcision find new uses. A ban on infant circumcision may severely impact the availability of foreskins for such uses.
1.3.1. Pro: Foreskins from circumcisions are used as starter material to produce large amounts of skin for [skin grafts.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1390499/?page=1)
1.3.1.1. Con: Intact foreskin can be used if that person needs a skin graft. Accidents happen.
1.3.1.2. Con: There are plenty of other, larger pieces of skin which can be used for a skin graft.
1.3.1.3. Con: Foreskins removed from adults could be used instead.
1.3.1.3.1. Pro: Adult foreskins provide more material per individual.
1.3.1.3.2. Con: Adult foreskin may not be a suitable substitute due to skin and other tissues changing with age.
1.3.1.3.2.1. Con: Using a newborn as a non-consensual organ donor is immoral nonetheless.
1.3.2. Con: The moral status of circumcision should be evaluated separately from late-stage business developments around the practice.
1.3.3. Con: Some of these new uses are questionable. Babies should not have their bodies mutilated so rich old women can get beautifying face cream. Cf.  [huffingtonpost.com](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/oprah-foreskin-protests-cream_n_3068851.html)
1.3.4. Con: This claim assumes that other people's desires for medical treatment, no matter how dire, supersede a baby's right to its own body.
1.3.5. Con: The exact same argument could be used against a proposed ban on baby kidney-harvesting: the kidney obtained from the baby immediately after birth finds new uses, and a ban may severely impact the availability of kidneys for such uses. Thus this support of circumcision is a reductio ad absurdum.
1.3.5.1. Con: Kidney harvesting would occur only if the child is already dead. Ethically, the parents can make this decision because there is no living child to be harmed, and there will be benefit to society.
1.3.6. Con: -> See 1.3.1.3.
1.4. Con: Circumcision is the cultural norm in some societies or groups of people.
1.4.1. Pro: Very few people frown on operations to lessen jug ears. They are considered beneficial, because kids will be more "beautiful" and will not be ridiculed for them. Being uncircumcised in a group that considers circumcised penises the norm or beauty standard would lead the kid to being shamed in the same way. Hence, circumcision should be accepted.
1.4.1.1. Con: Jug ear operations happen at an older age, where the child itself can chime in on whether it wants to have it or not.
1.4.1.2. Con: Society should abandon the normative beauty standards and accept all kinds of ears. Jug ear operations support the idea that we should all look in a specific way and that there is one objective beauty standard.
1.4.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.1.
1.4.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.
1.4.2. Con: This begs the question. That a behavior is presently normal does not imply that it should be so in the future. Determining norms with reason is the present exercise, and so norms cannot be appealed to with any authority.
1.4.3. Con: The fact that some practice is a cultural norm for a group of people doesn't mean it is morally acceptable.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Mass human sacrifices were cultural norm in [some societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice_in_Aztec_culture) and [groups of people](https://sites.psu.edu/kerenw/?p=102).
1.4.3.2. Pro: [Artificial cranial deformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cranial_deformation) of infants, often with lethal consequences, was a cultural norm in many societies among the globe.
1.4.4. Con: Cultural norms can be adjusted and adapted to the circumstances within the culture. It is the responsibility of cultural participants to examine their own cultural practices and evaluate if they are still necessary and ethical in the light of current knowledge and context.
1.4.5. Pro: As long as it is not objectively causing long term harm to its members, every culture has the right to perpetuate its view of the world and "form" its members, in mind and body, to serve and support the overall goals of that culture. It is - in essence - the entire gestalt of the concept of culture.
1.4.5.1. Con: This argument is a reductio ad absurdum, since it could be used to support female genital mutilation, foot binding, involuntary kidney-harvesting for infants, and other forms of mutilation.
1.4.5.2. Con: Because 'objective harm' is a concept that must be evaluated within the context of a particular culture, and because all cultures believe their practices are not objectively harmful \(or that the objective harm is justified\), this claim assumes the ability to evaluate cultures from an extraterrestrial, non-enculturated viewpoint which does not exist.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: -> See discussion #2649: Morality is objective.
1.4.5.3. Con: Circumcision can be traumatizing for the infant.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: It's better to do such a procedure when the patient can't remember it.
1.4.5.3.1.1. Con: Lack of remembering a traumatic event doesn't make the event itself morally justified.
1.4.5.3.2. Con: Millions of men are circumsized but have no signs of lasting trauma.
1.4.5.3.2.1. Con: Even if not every single man is traumatised, there is [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22114254) of later negative emotions and PTSD in some men.
1.4.5.3.2.1.1. Con: The study uses a lot of hedging words, such as "some men" and "some studies". Hence, we can question the extent to which this applies to a larger number of men.
1.4.5.3.2.2. Con: Large numbers of people who experience the same thing does not mean the people who experience something else should be ignored. Especially as these can potentially also be considered large numbers.
1.4.5.3.2.3. Pro: [Thirty percent](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43749/9789241596169_eng.pdf;jsessionid=9F6598EE75B29D758A73B799FD867CBC?sequence=1) of men are estimated to be circumcised in the world, yet the accounts of trauma reported are few and far between. \(pg. 6\)
1.4.5.3.2.3.1. Con: In societies where circumcision is common, the symptoms of these traumas would likely stay under the radar.
1.4.5.3.2.3.2. Con: Most people [do not consciously remember](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2006/10/not-unusual-to-forget-childhood-sexual-abuse/?) early childhood trauma, it is repressed and sometimes manifests itself in other ways.
1.4.5.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: If humans were to remember all trauma, they would live in constant fear, thus humans have been gifted the ability to forget traumatic situations.
1.4.5.3.2.4. Con: Denial, as well as a refusal to accept that an irreversible mistake has been made, constitute a significant reason for the trauma of circumcision to be denied both on an individual and cultural level [\(Goldman\)](http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/goldman1/).
1.4.5.3.3. Con: While there is some pain for infants during this procedure, there is considerably less pain than for more commonly accepted cosmetic procedures on children.
1.4.5.3.3.1. Con: A person shows their face to everyone in the community / peer group. While certain reconstructions may not be a physiological necessity, they surely constitute a psychological one.
1.4.5.3.3.2. Pro: For example, facial reconstruction which is not medically necessary but allows the child to be more accepted in their community is very painful in comparison.
1.4.5.3.3.3. Con: This could be an argument for banning other cosmetic procedures on children.
1.4.5.3.3.3.1. Pro: If we believe that something which is traumatising for an infant is bad, then all things which cause that trauma should be banned \(e.g. circumcision and cosmetic surgery\).
1.4.5.3.3.3.2. Con: Lots of things which cause benefit can come with a tradeoff of pain, which we are happy with to a limited extent. Given the health [benefits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684945/) of circumcision it is worth some pain.
1.4.5.3.3.3.2.1. Con: It should be up to the individual to decide if it's worth it.
1.4.5.3.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Parents can't just wait for their children to become adults before they can finally decide for themselves whether or not vaccines are worth the bad experience \(and potential risks\). Parents make decisions for their children which the children don't like all the time.
1.4.5.3.3.3.2.1.1.1. Con: There is an ongoing controversy about the negative effects circumcision may have. This is not the case with broccoli.

Also, eating broccoli doesn't leave any significant permanent effects on a child's body.
1.4.5.3.3.4. Pro: Many psychologists have suggested that [birth itself](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-trauma-addiction-connection/201109/are-we-born-trauma) is an early and severe form of trauma which could have lasting consequences.
1.4.5.3.3.4.1. Con: Birth cannot be prevented, circumcision can.
1.4.5.3.3.5. Con: The idea that circumcision is less painful for infants than it is for adults is outdated, and was based on a false assumption. It has been proven that babies experience pain. [cirp.org](http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/chamberlain/) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_babies#Late_19th_Century)
1.4.5.3.4. Pro: [Studies show](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/moral-landscapes/201501/circumcision-s-psychological-damage) that the pain from circumcision can alter the infant's brain or cause longterm psychological damage.
1.4.5.3.4.1. Con: Circumsision is often performed under anesthesia. There is no significant pain involved.
1.4.5.3.4.1.1. Con: Most forms of anesthesia used during circumcision are not sufficient to prevent pain severe enough to drastically [raise heart rates](http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/lander/).
1.4.5.3.4.1.2. Con: There is always danger of complications with anesthesia.
1.4.5.3.4.1.2.1. Con: Performing circumcision on an infant is a matter of safety. Circumcising a child less than a year old [decreases the risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4441785/) of anesthetic complications.
1.4.5.3.4.1.2.1.1. Con: Adult men can choose to get circumcised after weighing the benefits against the risk. It does not need to be performed on infants.
1.4.5.3.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: People in most religious \(Muslim and Jewish\) communities would much rather have their circumcision done while they are infant than wait till adulthood for countless different reasons.
1.4.5.3.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.4.5.3.4.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: The act of not performing circumcision while the person is an infant violates this person's wish to have been circumcised from birth.
1.4.5.3.4.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.7.2.1.
1.4.5.3.4.1.2.1.2. Con: This is not necessarily a matter of risk, but a matter of bodily autonomy. A child is not in the position to consent to permanent surgical interventions.
1.4.5.3.4.1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.4.5.3.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.4.5.3.4.2. Pro: Child abuse has been shown to have an effect on the [genomic and epigenetic profiles](https://www.genome.gov/27554258/child-abuse-leaves-epigenetic-marks/).
1.4.5.3.4.2.1. Con: [Jewish achievement](https://www.thoughtco.com/impressive-jewish-accomplishments-2076052) in many pursuits far exceeds what might be expected, given their population distribution. If there are long-term psychological risks, it would stand to reason that in the face of this statistic that they do not present a hindrance overall.
1.4.5.3.4.2.1.1. Con: The achievements of these populations could be in spite of circumcision, instead of thanks to circumcision. Correlation does not imply causation.
1.4.5.3.4.2.1.2. Con: Circumcision is common in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, both regions that have achieved relatively little that impacted the rest of the world positively for the last centuries. It seems as if circumcision is not the/a decisive factor here.
1.4.5.3.4.3. Con: The article cited in support relies on studies of children and adolescents, not infants. How a three-to-five year old child \(or older\) perceives and remembers a circumcision done at that age has no relevancy at all to the impact of *infant* circumcision, which is the topic in question.
1.4.5.3.4.3.1. Con: [Similar studies](http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/talbert/) can be found on circumcision right after birth.
1.4.5.3.4.4. Pro: Infant circumcision was shown in one [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9057731) to lead to increased pain sensitivity later in life.
1.4.5.3.4.5. Con: -> See 1.4.5.3.4.2.1.
1.4.5.3.5. Pro: There is now [scientific consensus](http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/boyle6/) that there is severe pain at the time of circumcision and shortly thereafter in unanaesthetised boys, as well as heightened pain sensitivity for some considerable period of time afterwards. Even if there are no long term impacts of circumcision, the short term trauma experienced by the child is unacceptable.
1.5. Pro: Circumcision violates body autonomy.
1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.
1.5.2. Pro: It should be banned - on the basis that no irreversible unnecessary medical procedure should be inflicted on an individual without their informed consent.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.10.2.
1.5.4. Pro: The [Convention on the Rights of the Child](http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/UN-convention/) grants children protections and certain rights from having a circumcision against their own choice.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Article 14:1 says that 'States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.'
1.5.4.1.1. Con: Article 14:1 does not apply to parents choosing circumcision, since it is limiting the state's ability to impose state mandated religious indoctrination on children and has no bearing on the decisions of the parents.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Article 14:3 states: 'Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.' Thus circumcising a child takes away this freedom without any of these limitations being present.
1.5.4.2.1. Con: Circumcising a child may not be limited under Article 14:3, since circumcision does not violate any of the applicable limitations.
1.5.4.2.1.1. Pro: Circumcision does not impact public safety.
1.5.4.2.1.2. Pro: As the impact on public order cannot be evaluated, circumcision does not violate that part of the law.
1.5.4.2.1.3. Pro: Circumcision has no impact on public morals.
1.5.4.2.1.4. Pro: Circumcision does not take away fundamental rights or freedoms. Everything done by an uncircumcised person is still free to be done by a circumcised person.
1.5.4.2.1.4.1. Con: The argument against both female and male circumcision is one of bodily autonomy, not harm. Both are arguably harmful but the real damage is taking the right to intact genitals away from children.
1.5.4.3. Pro: Article 24 states: 'States Parties shall take all effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children.' This includes the practice of circumcision.
1.5.4.3.1. Con: Article 24 does not apply to circumcision, because in order to be considered prejudicial to the health of children, it should be demonstrable and irrefutable that there are serious and egregious health risks.
1.5.4.3.1.1. Pro: Article 24 also does not apply to such practices as ritual scarring, tribal tattooing, and other body modifications that impart symbolic and cultural meaning.
1.5.4.3.1.1.1. Con: If those practices are undertaken by consenting adults, then they fall under any other kind of body modification performed on consenting adults and they are perfectly fine. If not, the same argument against circumcision applies there.
1.5.4.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.1.1.1.2.
1.5.4.3.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.2.2.3.
1.5.4.4. Con: It is fallacious to take the law as a given when something being a law is not an argument for whether something is right. Many abhorrent things were legal at one point. Slavery is one such example.
1.5.4.4.1. Pro: Laws are written by humans who have biases, prejudices, and a particular moral viewpoint that is dependent \(partially\) on the society and time in which they live, meaning laws vary vastly across time and region.
1.5.4.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.
1.5.5. Pro: Circumcision is a gross over-reach of parental authority.
1.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.5.5.2. Con: Children are likely to have the same values and outlook on risks as their parent [\(Barni and Knafo, p. 8\)](https://ojs.ub.uni-konstanz.de/srm/article/download/5089/4686/) . Therefore, if parents view the potential benefits of circumcision as outweighing possible harms, they are likely to see the world the same way.
1.5.5.2.1. Con: The fact a child will 'Likely' have the same beliefs is not good enough to justify a permanent action.
1.5.5.2.1.1. Pro: The child born Jewish may end up atheist.
1.5.5.2.2. Con: One could use the same argument to support female genital mutilation or any kind of child abuse. That doesn't mean it is ethical.
1.5.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.2.
1.5.6. Con: The autonomy argument presupposes a status of independence which babies do not have.
1.5.6.1. Con: It is impossible to ignore the autonomy argument because while the baby may not have independence at the time of the procedure, the reality is that they will gain that independence at some point.

Circumcision is a violation of the future adult's autonomy. The fact that it happened before anyone knew what the adult's choice would have been does not change the reality that the adult's choice has been overridden.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: A baby might grow into someone who objects to vaccinations. In deference to that possibility, should a parent not vaccinate? The parental decisions as to what is for the good of the child drive parenting from before day one.
1.5.6.1.1.1. Con: If there were evidence that suggested that vaccinations are dangerous and unnecessary this would be an equivalent comparison, but considering the information we have available we can conclude that it is not equivalent.
1.5.6.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.3.
1.5.6.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.6.4.
1.5.6.2. Con: By that logic we should be able to perform non-consensual cosmetic surgeries on the severely mentally challenged, the insane, and prisoners. Clearly this would be as wrong as circumcising an infant.
1.5.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.6.4.
1.5.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.
1.5.6.5. Con: The right to physical autonomy does not rely on agency, or mental capacity. Plants, animals, children, the disabled, and the comatose all have a right to physical autonomy. The question of dependence or independence is a distraction.
1.5.7. Con: Given that the child is unable to offer an opinion either way, the wish of the child's parents is the best proxy for the interests of the child.
1.5.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.6.4.2.
1.5.7.2. Con: Parents are unable to give guardian consent for any other non-medical surgical body modification.
1.5.7.3. Con: The baby that receives circumcision is not given a choice. It is not fair that the parents decide for them.
1.5.7.3.1. Con: The baby is also not given a choice about his name, his clothing, his lunch or his medical care. Parents express their values in their rearing of a child. A child does not have a say in many decisions made on his behalf.
1.5.7.3.1.1. Con: When/if parents make dangerous/unhealthy/unethical decisions for their children, child protection comes into play.
1.5.7.3.1.2. Con: People can relatively easily legally change their name later in life if they wish. This is an unrealistic comparison.
1.5.7.3.1.3. Con: None of those are permanent surgical interventions with the attached risk; the decision to circumcise creates damage that cannot be revoked. As such they cannot be compared.
1.5.7.3.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.4.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2. Con: There are medical \(and cosmetic\) interventions approved by parents which are permanent and which carry the risk of any medical intervention.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.1. Con: Medical interventions should be undertaken when there is sufficient reason to take them: for instance, to prevent speech impediment in the case of a tongue tie.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.1.1. Con: The idea of "sufficient reason" is dependent on the sensibility of the expert subscribed to.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con: As there is arguably no evidence for a soul, 'concern for the soul' is an invalid grounds to make a medical decision.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: While scientific evidence is a useful tool for decision-making, good decisions are also often made with other considerations in mind, such as personal philosophy and unevidenced reason.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: When making preferment life changing decisions for another entity who can't make their own, the entity making the decision's personal considerations should not be accounted for.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: In that there are certain irreversible decisions that inextricably require personal beliefs to play a part \(the basis of a child's moral teaching being one\), the personal beliefs of the parents must be allowed a role in every decision.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: One might say the tie is a problem calling for a procedure because it prevents a proper latch when nursing while another would say to abandon nursing and just bottle feed. If a parent subscribes to a faith that makes a concern for the soul "sufficient reason" then the intervention would be justified.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.6.5.1.1.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.1.2. Con: "Sufficient reason" may include religious mandate.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.7.3.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.2. Con: Piercing is reversible and is not a surgical intervention. It carries an even lesser risk than circumcision and even so it is considered bad practice for a number of reasons.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.3. Pro: From piercings to vaccines to remediating a tongue tie, parents choose paths for the child without asking permission from the infant. Their reasoning ranges from cosmetic to dealing with non-life threatening issues but it is the parents' decision as to what is important enough to do.
1.5.7.3.1.3.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.
1.5.7.4. Con: The child's parents who choose to circumcise are not invested in the interests of their child, they have prioritised their religion or preference as a priority over their child's future wish.
1.5.7.4.1. Con: This is a textbook example of the hasty generalization fallacy, times two.To broadly state parents who choose to circumcise their infants are not invested in the interests of their child, and have prioritized religion over a child's future wish, is patently false. A huge percentage of parents circumcising their infant do it for medical reasons.
1.5.7.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.2.
1.5.7.4.2. Con: Parents may circumcise their child in belief that the religious act will result in greater chance of getting into heaven, increased fortune, or other beliefs that the parent believes to be in the interest of the child.
1.5.7.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.7.2.1.
1.5.7.4.3. Con: Every religious parent passes on their religion to do their child good. All the Abrahamic religions teach how to love and respect your family.
1.5.7.5. Con: The best proxy for the child is the child when they come of an appropriate age to make decisions like these.
1.5.7.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.3.4.1.2.1.1.1.
1.5.7.6. Pro: Parents are trusted to know a child's preferences, or to make decisions that they believe are in the child's best interest.
1.5.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.1.1.
1.5.7.6.2. Pro: Parents are the best actor to do this in general, as they will raise the child, interact with him or her more than anyone else and therefore have the best idea of their preferences.
1.5.7.6.2.1. Con: It is impossible to know a baby's preferences on circumcision at such a young age. It is impossible to communicate with a baby, and even if it could, it does not have the cognitive abilities to understand what it is.
1.5.7.6.3. Con: It is impossible to approximate a child's preferences when they are only eight days old.
1.5.7.7. Con: Opinions that are not verbally expressed are still opinions. A child has strong opinions about comfort, discomfort, hunger, and pain. The crying of a circumcised infant is the strong expression of an opinion.
1.5.7.7.1. Con: But most of a child's opinions are very misguided and based on inexperience of what's best for it. Therefore every child has a parent who makes important decisions for it until it qualifies to make these kind of decisions itself.
1.5.7.7.1.1. Pro: The crying of a child who wants to eat candy and play video games all day is a strong expression of an opinion – but an unqualified opinion nonetheless.
1.5.7.7.1.1.1. Con: Eating sweets or playing games are not permanent, lifelong body-altering changes. They leave little impact on a person and can't be compared to mutilation of the genitals.
1.5.7.7.1.2. Con: If the parent claim were valid we would have no reason to trust a baby's cries of hunger or discomfort, since the baby 'has no experience'.
1.5.7.7.1.3. Con: This implicitly begs the question, since not all parental decisions are correct by definition. In fact, many parents are completely clueless, including those that circumcise their children.
1.5.7.7.1.4. Con: The child should be free to choose this procedure when he does in fact "qualify to make these decisions itself". Circumcision is irreversible, waiting until they can consent seems the most logical option, as it [can be performed at any age.](https://teens.webmd.com/boys/circumcision-faq)
1.5.8. Con: The vast majority of developed countries have laws granting parents almost absolute autonomy in regards to making choices for their children \(excluding criminal abuse of course\).
1.5.8.1. Con: This claim begs the question of whether infant circumcision counts as criminal abuse, which is precisely the question being discussed.
1.5.8.2. Con: Banning circumcision would make it criminal abuse.
1.5.8.3. Con: Logical fallacy: argumentum ad populum. The fact that other people believe X has no relevance on whether X is valid. The validity of allowing parents to violate their children's autonomy is precisely the issue at stake.
1.5.9. Con: So do childhood vaccinations, yet most reasonable people would agree that the benefits are worthwhile.
1.5.9.1. Con: Vaccinations protect a child and the human species/society as a whole against widespread and potentially deadly diseases. Circumcision does not. The diseases that circumcision is often claimed to prevent can be prevented/remedied in less drastic/damaging ways.
1.5.9.2. Con: Vaccinations rarely leave lasting damage.
1.5.9.3. Pro: Vaccinations offer proven, fact-based, objective health benefits. Due to their very nature, the same cannot be said about religious practices.
1.5.9.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.4.
1.5.9.3.2. Con: Religious people have a [greater life expectancy](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/religion-live-longer-muslim-jewish-christian-hindu-buddhist-life-expectancy-age-a8396866.html) than atheists and agnostics.
1.5.9.4. Con: Doctors can provide medically necessary treatment to incapacitated patients without consent. Childhood vaccinations are medically necessary and there is a medical reason not wait until the child is old enough to consent. This is not the case with circumcision.
1.6. Pro: Circumcision may have a negative effect on sexual activity later in life.
1.6.1. Con: Circumcision prevents sexual diseases, so it has a positive effect on sexual life overall, even if it is not on the sexual activity itself but on what comes after the sexual activity.          [www.webmd.com](https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/news/20141202/cdc-endorses-circumcision-for-health-reasons)
1.6.2. Pro: Masturbation is [more difficult without foreskin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation#Male), and may require some sex toys like artificial vagina.
1.6.3. Con: There exists a [preference](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01614576.1988.11074930) for circumcised penises from many sexual partners due to hygiene and smelliness. The man will thank his parents later.
1.6.3.1. Con: If the man doesn't like his parents' decision, reversing it is much harder than having circumcision done when he's adult.
1.6.4. Pro: The foreskin contains 20000 nerve endings \(for comparison the clitoris has 8000\), removing the foreskin can drastically change the ability to and intensity of male climax.[foreskin.org](http://www.foreskin.org/fleiss.htm)
1.6.4.1. Con: The exact number of nerve endings in the foreskin is still [subject to debate](http://thecircumcisiondecision.com/20000-nerve-endings/). Therefore, any conclusions about the sensitivity based on this number alone are unsupported.
1.6.5. Pro: The female partners of men with circumcised penises report more vaginal pains and an [inferior sex life.](http://sciencenordic.com/male-circumcision-leads-bad-sex-life)
1.6.5.1. Con: This has little to do with whether it would be alright to ban the practice. Using deterioration of sex life as a basis for a blanket ban, one could ban the pornography industry, masturbation, romantic comedy films, children, and pets.
1.6.5.1.1. Con: This is a false equivalency, since we are only discussing banning the procedure for children, not banning the procedure outright.
1.6.5.2. Con: The study itself concludes that more research is necessary and that the study did not include Muslim or Jewish men who do make up a significant portion of the people who have undergone this procedure.
1.6.5.2.1. Pro: For the participants in the test that represented the circumcised population, the amount representing the uncircumcised was 10-fold.
1.6.5.2.1.1. Con: The different groups studied don't need to be equal in size, as long as they are all large enough to be representative. It's the percentages that count in statistics, not absolute numbers.
1.6.5.2.1.2. Pro: The number of females the test used to construct the data of 'women's experience with circumcised men' was less than a hundred. This is not representative data.
1.6.5.3. Con: The referred study was done in Denmark, and as such mostly included men circumcised for medical reasons, differing both in method and age from the actual process of infant circumcision, and therefore irrelevant for this main topic.
1.6.5.3.1. Pro: Ironically, [the professor](https://www.ssi.dk/English/Service/Contact/Employees/Person.aspx?id=b2d3680b-9492-4e4b-a279-9d8800af6d7e) that they linked to in the article has written [a paper](https://www.ssi.dk/~/media/Publikationer/2016/2016-07-01_commentary_frisch_earp_on_paper_by_shabanzadeh_et_al_dmj_1.ashx) criticising another study for ignoring the bias circumcised men have towards favouring circumcision because of their culture and environmental influence – while [the test article](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/40/5/1367/658163) that was also referred to ignores the bias Danes have towards disliking circumcision for the same exact reasons.
1.6.6. Con: The International Society for Sexual Medicine states that this procedure [does not affect](http://www.issm.info/sexual-health-qa/does-circumcision-affect-sexual-function-or-pleasure) either function or satisfaction.
1.6.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.4.3.1.
1.6.7. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374102) conducted on a large cohort of circumcised males showed that foreskin is important for penile sensitivity, overall sexual satisfaction, and penile functioning.
1.6.7.1. Pro: A [higher percentage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374102) of circumcised men experience discomfort or pain and unusual sensations as compared with the uncircumcised population.
1.6.7.2. Con: Several experts [criticised](https://www.livescience.com/27769-does-circumcision-reduce-sexual-pleasure.html) this study for using a biased sample population and not having measured sensitivity changes before and after circumcision.
1.6.7.3. Con: The effect size quoted in this study is too small to be clinically meaningful, which makes their conclusions tenuous at best.
1.6.7.3.1. Con: The sample size is far greater than is necessary to reach saturation \(the point at which the sample size no longer makes a difference to the results provided via said study\). Therefore, the "effect size" isn't an issue for this particular study, as a more than adaequate sample size was consulted to produce these results.[Statistic Solutions; additional studies on linked page](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/qualitative-sample-size/)
1.6.8. Con: A number of studies have indicated that circumcision has either no effect, or a positive one on sexual activity.
1.6.8.1. Con: According to other studies, there are negative effects for a large percentage of men.

[Study by Kim and Pang](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6643531_The_effect_of_male_circumcision_on_sexuality)

[Study by Bronselaar et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374102)
1.6.8.2. Pro: [Researchers](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-about-sex/201510/does-circumcision-reduce-men-s-sexual-sensitivity) in Kenya surveyed the sexual function, pleasure, and satisfaction of 2,784 uncircumcised sexually active adult men. Then they circumcised 1,391 of them, and re-surveyed the entire group every six months for two years. In every survey, the two groups showed no statistically significant differences in sexual function, pleasure, or satisfaction.
1.6.8.3. Pro: A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1607551X13002684) of 506 young adult males in Taiwan found that sexual performance after adult circumcision seems to be improved among the patients, especially in sexual drive and confidence of erection.
1.6.9. Pro: Circumcision [reduces](https://www.kialo.com/13673/13673.0=13673.1+13673.11+13673.877/+13673.877/comments) \(p. 265\) the penis's ability to 'glide' within its own loose skin, increasing friction and increasing the need for lubricants. It can decrease pleasure for receptive sexual partners.
1.6.9.1. Con: [Circumcised men tend to last longer](http://www.nature.com/articles/ijir201347) since their penis gland is not overly sensitive, decreasing the risk of premature ejaculation, leading to overall greater chance for the receptive sexual partner to reach orgasm.
1.6.9.1.1. Con: The causes of premature ejaculation are suspected to be mostly psychological. [Link](https://www.webmd.com/men/what-is-premature-ejaculation#1-3)[Another link](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premature-ejaculation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354900)
1.6.9.1.1.1. Con: If it is only "mostly" the cause, then this doesn't really work as an argument opposing the claim that circumcision does in fact have significance to pre-ejaculation.
1.6.9.1.1.2. Con: [This study](http://www.nature.com/articles/ijir201347) shows that men who are circumcised do last longer than uncircumcised men.
1.6.9.1.2. Con: The majority of men don't suffer from premature ejaculation, so it doesn't make sense to circumcise them to treat them for a problem they may never even get later in life. We don't amputate young girl's breast tissue to prevent breast cancer either.

[Premature ejaculation Epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ejaculation#Epidemiology)
1.6.9.1.3. Con: If a man wants to get circumcized to treat his ejaculation problems, he can always do so when he's an adult.
1.6.9.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.3.3.
1.6.9.1.4. Con: [Most women](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-about-sex/200903/the-most-important-sexual-statistic) don't reach orgasms from vaginal intercourse, no matter how long it lasts. They depend on clitoral stimulation.
1.7. Pro: Circumcision is often equated to genital mutilation.
1.7.1. Pro: Most parents would feel guilty if the surgery they had performed on their child were suddenly to be considered mutilation. This guilt is indication that the practice is inherently wrong, but its wrongness is masked by social acceptance.
1.7.1.1. Pro: If a parent were to watch their child undergo this surgery in the way it is usually performed \(without anesthetic\), they would feel incredibly guilty regardless of social acceptance. Infants usually have [strapped down](https://www.quickmedical.com/olympicmedical/circumstraint/immobolizer.html) to prevent them struggling. It is an incredibly cruel procedure.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Strapping down an infant for the procedure is largely preventative. Since infants are unable to control their own motion, strapping them down can prevent complications.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Con: The surgery is elective; if it is not carried out, there would be no complications to worry about.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The complications would be spiritual in nature. For religious reasons, if a child is not circumcised, the soul or acceptance in the eyes of God/Allah, may be compromised.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The acceptance of any divine being which required the parents cut off the foreskins of baby boys \(foreskins which the divine being created to begin with\) is something to be rejected.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This 'complication' is not even a concept, only a phrase. In terms of rationality and justification, it is on the same level as a schizophrenic cutting off a child's earlobes so the voices will accept that child.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: It is morally wrong to impose religious beliefs and practices on one's young children indiscriminately.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Parents should not be allowed to impose any religious practices or procedures on their children if they are irreversible, painful or potentially harmful.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Even if it is morally wrong to impose religious beliefs on one's children, this does not mean it should be banned. Many immoral behaviours ought to be legal.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.1. Con: This argument is a [Tu quoque fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque), just because some behaviors should be banned in some instances, and some practices that are banned in others shouldn't be banned has no bearing on the argument.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2. Pro: Banning parents from sharing their religious beliefs with their children violates the right of those parents to freely practice their religion.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Many ardent followers of religion see involving their children in their religious practices important to the actualization of their child's life as well. Denying parents the ability to do so might harm their ability to self-realize.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: Many ardent followers of religion [engage in child abuse](http://nospank.net/fortune.htm) that they deem important because of their [interpretation of biblical verses](https://www.alternet.org/belief/breaking-their-will-sick-biblical-literalism-leads-child-abuse-and-even-death) such as "spare the rod, spoil the child". We must still protect children against the abuses of their parents, regardless of their beliefs or self image.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: There are many accounts of children beaten and abused by Christian parents. For example, [a Christian sect](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ex-members-describe-military-style-christian-sect-now-accused-child-n796131) was charged with raping and abusing children. The religious freedom of the parents is not sufficient to allow this to continue.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.1.1.2. Con: The article cited refers to Christian abusers. Christian abusers are misguided in their interpretation of Christian scripture , which clearly states "[Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A4&version=ESV)"
This is an argument for vigorous education on the religious teachings.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: The fact that parents can \(and often do\) misinterpret religious mandates is a perfect reason for why we should not allow them to permanently alter their children based on these beliefs.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Circumcision is a practice that all Muslims and Jews agree about being a fundamental part of their religion. It is not some individual misinterpretation.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.1.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3. Pro: Imposing religious beliefs and practises that permanently alter the body has lasting long term consequences.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1. Con: The government should never force people to violate their conscience in their decisions about how they carry out their faith in a way that is irrefutably supported by their scriptures.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: The government should protect its citizens, independent of whether the individual\(s\) causing harm believe it's the right thing to do. In the same way a terrorist wouldn't blow him/herself up if they didn't think it was the right thing to do.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: There is a fundamental difference between actively trying to cause damage and kill \(as a terrorist attack would do\), and actively trying to protect \(as circumcision is intended to do\).
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Both the terrorist and parent think they are helping.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Terrorists think they are helping their own by knowingly and purposely harming others \(those terrorized\) - terrorism is an act done to those you wish to harm. Circumcision is an act done to those you wish to help.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.1.1.2. Con: Circumcision is usually performed as a religious act, not an act of protection.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.6.5.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.1.2. Con: The family is the most local form of government, and as such holds the highest responsibility to protect its citizens \(members\). This should occur independently of whether some larger governing bodies conclude that their practices are harmful.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.1.2.1. Con: For a natural law to occur without the need for external governing bodies, people would have to be themselves natural. Circumcision is a practice derived from an external law. A religious law and not something that would come about through the actions of person acting out their natural morality and justice. In order for people to make free decisions that are morally correct, they need to be free themselves and not beholden to an external law giver.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: Anyone can break the law if this is the case. All someone needs to do is declare a moral imperative based on their own made up religious doctrine.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.3. Con: If someone used scripture to justify their actions they could breach many agreed upon laws that protect us from barbarity.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: From a purely literal reading of the scriptures, the laws therein can be perceived as barbaric. For example, "When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets: Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her." Deuteronomy 25:11-12 [biblegateway.com](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+25%3A11-12&version=NIV)
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.1.4. Pro: The ban on infant circumcision is a clear anti-theistic statement that represents the separation of religion and state. This is a mandatory approach for a humanistic modern society.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.2. Con: Everything has lasting long term consequences - but that doesn't mean they are all bad.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.2.1. Pro: A child of religious parents can \(and will most often\) be grateful that he was circumcised as a child so he doesn't have to undergo the procedure as an adult where it is much more difficult and with more complications.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.8.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.1.4.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.4. Con: It is morally imperative to raise young children to follow one's own religion.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.4.1. Con: It is morally more imperative to keep one's children safe from harm, especially from harm inflicted by authority figures like parents and clergy. Forcible cosmetic surgery is harm.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.6.5.1.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.5. Con: All parenting involves the imposition of subjective values and practices onto a child's life. There is no totally value-neutral way to parent. It is unclear why religious values are significantly different from other sorts of cultural and social values to be declared totally immoral.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6. Con: Morality is not an objective standard. Some parents exercise their vision of morality in different ways. Teaching religion, civics or fashion are all ways in which parents pass on their values before children are old enough to learn on their own.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.1. Con: There is a fundamental difference between teaching a child something and surgically altering them.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.2. Con: The fact that morality is not an objective standard implies that the morality of the child may differ from the morality of the parent. Infant circumcision allows the parent to permanently carve their personal morality onto a child who may not agree with it. Adults can not do this to each other so they should not be able to do it to their children.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.3. Con: Morality is an objective standard. Pedophilia, child abuse and genocide are always bad.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.2.1.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.4. Con: There are objective standards that can be applied to determine morality. One could use harm as a basis, for instance. In which case you cannot justify infant circumcision.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.4.1. Con: There are no objective standards because what one person considers harm, another might not.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.4.1.1. Con: If you inflict pain on a non-consenting organism, this is considered objectively harmful. Hence laws specifically prohibiting bodily harm against both humans and animals.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.4.1.1.1. Con: So the doctor should not slap the child to help breathing start, or administer a heel stick or any other shots as the child grows. They all inflict pain and rarely does a pediatrician ask the 6 month old if he wants a shot.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.4.1.1.1.1. Con: This is another false equivalency as, by the admission of the claim, those actions are to reinforce the well-being of the child, not to satisfy an archaic religious ideal or out of date medical advice.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.4.1.1.2. Con: Disciplining a person may cause pain in a non-consenting person, but is seen as helpful.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.4.1.1.2.1. Pro: Swatting a child's hand away from a hot burner may inflict pain in a non-consenting person, but it prevents greater pain.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: Pulling a child away from traffic might hurt, but it could prevent death.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.4.1.1.2.3. Pro: Spanking a child \(non-abusively, mind you\) may inflict pain, but it could teach a lesson that would otherwise go unlearned by the child.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.4.1.2. Con: The child is unable to communicate whether they consider the procedure to be harmful or not.

The above claim demonstrates why the consent of the individual is required, as well as why consent by proxy of the parents is unacceptable. The parents cannot make an accurate assessment of the child's own definitions of what counts as harm.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.6.4.1.3. Pro: Certain people enjoy playing violent video games. Others believe them to be inherently harmful. This does not mean that violent video games are inherently good or bad.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.7. Pro: It is clearly immoral to forcefully impose religious practices on adults who do not consent to participating in those practices. Since small children are incapable of offering consent, it is similarly immoral to impose religious practices on small children.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.7.1. Con: There is a difference between actively withholding consent \(in the case of the adults\), and simply being unable to make a decision either way \(in the case of small children\). Imposing religious beliefs in the first case is much worse than in the second case.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.7.1.1. Con: What is considered worse is subjective and therefore cannot be considered in absolute terms.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.7.1.2. Pro: For example, removing someone from life support even though they have actively indicated that they want to keep life support is grossly immoral, since they have actively withdrawn their consent. But if someone is in terrible pain, and is not in a fit state of mind to understand what is going on, it might be moral to remove them from life support even though they cannot actively consent.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.7.1.2.1. Con: There is a large ethical difference between keeping someone alive via life support and performing cosmetic surgery on an infant. This claim is a strawman fallacy.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.7.1.2.2. Con: It is only moral to remove life support when life has already expired. It may be ethical without being moral. This is an important distinction.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.7.1.3. Con: Neither is 'worse'; both are morally wrong.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.7.2. Con: If it is immoral to impose religious practices on one's children as part of their education, then it is likewise immoral to impose secular practices such as curfews and bedtimes, going to the doctor and dentist regularly, getting shots and vaccines, and going to school.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.7.2.1. Con: If those secular practices serve real and important purposes, then it is moral to impose them on children. By contrast, religious practices serve no *intrinsic* purpose that justifies imposing them on people who do not yet accord with them.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.7.2.2. Pro: From the perspective of a religious parent, there is no principled distinction to be drawn between secular practices and religious practices - both serve similar purposes, and can be imposed for the same reasons.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.4. Con: If a religion mandated that male children must be given large facial tattoos expressing the religious beliefs of the parent this would clearly be considered unethical. Just because something is traditional does not mean it is acceptable.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Such ethical and moral determinations require education and cultural awareness to appreciate.
1.7.1.1.1.1.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.2.
1.7.1.2. Con: A general feeling of guilt is not indication that a thing is inherently wrong.
1.7.1.2.1. Pro: Conservatives and Liberals speaking together often feel guilty for sharing dissenting views, but that does not mean that this sharing is inherently wrong. On the contrary, sharing dissenting viewpoints, as we are here, is inherently good in civil discourse.
1.7.1.3. Con: If a feeling of guilt is indication that a practice is inherently wrong and should therefore be banned, then there should be bans on such activities as listening to "guilty pleasure" music, disciplining children, correcting mistakes, asking one's boss for a raise, etc.
1.7.1.4. Pro: Cultural norms of circumcision which exist have meant that it is deemed acceptable and not immoral. The same holds true for FGM - in places where it is seen as the norm, it occurs without being considered wrong.
1.7.1.4.1. Pro: People are rational and always do what they believe to be the best option in a given circumstance. They never believe what they are doing is wrong.
1.7.2. Con: The impact on sex life is far lesser than that of most types of female genital mutilation.
1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.6.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Partial or total removal of clitoris is fairly usual part of FGM, making clitoral orgasm nearly impossible. Lack of foreskin is usually only a minor obstacle in reaching orgasm.
1.7.2.3. Con: Lesser impact does not mean no impact. In the case of circumcision, there is.
1.7.3. Con: Many beneficial medical procedures would fit the definition of mutilation. It falls on the guardian to decide which medical procedures are necessary.
1.7.3.1. Con: The guardian is not a medical professional. No-one is against circumcision when there is a medical necessity. Religious belief is not a medical necessity.
1.7.4. Pro: [Mutilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilation) is the act of cutting off or injuring a body part so that part is damaged, disfigured, and/or permanently altered. Circumcision does just this.
1.7.4.1. Pro: Mutilation of infants should never be allowed. If someone wanted to cut their child's arm of because of culture or religion, we would call them crazy and take their child away.
1.7.4.2. Con: The term 'permanently altered' is not one used when referring to mutilation. Mutilation holds a negative connotation like 'damaging' or 'disfigured', while circumcision does not.
1.7.4.3. Con: Lots of actions parents are allowed to do to their children permanently alter the body, e.g. ear piercing, having an appendix removed.
1.7.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.
1.7.4.3.2. Con: However, these practices do not come with associated pain or trauma later in life.
1.7.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.
1.7.4.3.3. Con: To not perform an appendix removal operation might be life-threatening. Circumcision is not a lifesaving act.
1.7.5. Pro: Female circumcision is considered genital mutilation. Male circumcision is no different.
1.7.5.1. Pro: It is not legal for parents to cosmetically remove their infant daughters' labia. For the same reason, it should not be legal to remove their infant sons' foreskin.
1.7.5.1.1. Pro: Some types of female genital mutilation \(as classified by [WHO](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/overview/en/)\) aren't that much different from male circumcision, as in case of Ia only clitoral hood or prepuce is removed, and in case of IIa, only labia minora is removed. As this is considered illegal and mutilation, so should be circumcision of male infants.
1.7.5.1.2. Con: Male circumcision has health benefits, whereas female circumcision has none, only harm.
1.7.5.1.2.1. Con: FGM type IIa, as classified by [WHO](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/overview/en/), is a partial or complete removal of labia minora. Some adult women with especially long labia minora request the same procedure for aesthetical, sexual or medical reasons. On an infant though, it is mutilation because of the lack of consent, despite potential benefits.
1.7.5.1.2.2. Pro: Female genital mutilation increases short and long term health risks for women and girls, ranging in severity from acute pain to possibly death.
1.7.5.1.2.2.1. Con: The same is true for male circumcision.
1.7.5.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.7.5.1.2.2.2. Con: Most of these health risks would be mitigated by anesthesia, sterile environment and some basic surgical skills.
1.7.5.1.2.2.3. Pro: [Immediate consequences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195700/) of FGM include shock, haemorrhage, infections and psychological consequences.
1.7.5.1.2.2.4. Pro: The [long term](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195700/) health risks consist of chronic pain, infections, keloid formation, primary infertility, birth complications, danger to the newborn and psychological consequences.
1.7.5.1.2.3. Pro: Female genital mutilation may [increase](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/health_consequences_fgm/en/) the risk of HIV in women and girls, while circumcision in males has shown an opposite effect.
1.7.5.1.2.3.1. Con: By the second article's own admission, this is an assumption with no reinforcing evidence.
1.7.5.1.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.6.
1.7.5.1.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.15.
1.7.5.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.5.4.2.1.4.1.
1.7.5.1.2.5. Con: If forcible preventative surgery for speculative future ailments could be considered a health benefit then parents could justify removing almost any infant body part. For example, cutting off her ears so she doesn't get earlobe cancer.
1.7.5.2. Pro: The female clitoris foreskin serves the equivalent function as the male foreskin. Just like a male circumcision, the female circumcision [type 1a](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/overview/en/) aims at removing only that particular piece of skin. Unlike for boys' foreskin removal, it is prohibited by law for females. That violates gender equality.
1.7.5.3. Pro: Female circumcision, or [female genital mutilation](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/) \(FGM\), consists of procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. This is the same process for male circumcision.
1.7.5.3.1. Con: There are medical reasons behind some parents' decisions to have their boy circumcised. As dubious these reasons might be, it is quite often not cultural or religious background.
1.7.5.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.
1.7.5.3.2. Con: FGM is far more extreme than male circumcision, it is intended to [remove female sexual pleasure](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/attraction-evolved/201606/does-fgm-make-women-less-interested-in-sex). Sexual pleasure is a human joy and part of a person's identity. No human has the right to attempt to remove this part of a person's life as part of some arbitrary and medieval religious practice.
1.7.5.3.3. Con: Most types of FGM includes - among other mutilation - removal of the clitoris, which is in itself anatomically homologue of the glans penis. [visiblebody.com](https://www.visiblebody.com/blog/anatomy-and-physiology-homologues-of-reproductive-anatomy)
1.7.5.3.4. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.2.2.3.1.1.1.2.1.
1.7.5.3.5. Con: -> See 1.7.5.1.2.
1.7.5.4. Con: Female genital mutilation is bad because it is [motivated by](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/01/female-genital-mutilation-is-about-misogyny-and-violence-against-women) misogynistic social structures that use it to oppress women. The same is not true for male circumcision.
1.7.5.4.1. Con: The gender of the child should not dictate the ethics of our treatment of them.
1.7.5.4.1.1. Pro: For example, if it were socially considered to be gender hateful and oppressive to give an infant daughter a large face tattoo but perfectly ok to do the same to an infant son, it would still be unethical for parents to do so.
1.7.5.4.1.2. Pro: This is not a sexist issue. It would not be okay to circumcise both male and female babies.
1.7.5.4.2. Con: Assumptions about motivations are speculative, theoretical, and often based on ideology rather than evidence. The acceptability of an action should depend on its practical effects, not vague academic theorising about its meaning.
1.7.5.4.3. Con: FGM is often performed by female practitioners. This applies to some other forms of mutilation like breast ironing as well. While misogyny or oppression of women sure plays a major role, calling it the sole factor or motivation is oversimplification.
1.7.5.4.4. Pro: Many forms of FGM greatly reduce women's pleasure in sexual life. Some of the most extreme forms enforce chastity, being a very oppressive practice.
1.7.5.4.5. Con: Circumcision - particularly in America - is arguably a misandrist practice, and from a social standpoint could be considered just as bad.
1.7.5.4.5.1. Pro: This is further evidenced by the fact a common reason used in defence of infant circumcision is aesthetic in nature.
1.7.5.4.5.1.1. Con: The aesthetic argument, while allegedly common, has not entered into this discussion thus far.
1.7.5.4.5.1.2. Con: The idea of aesthetically altering a child is not uncommon in the Western world. Girls often have their ears pierced, and cleft palates are corrected even if they do not impede the function of the mouth, for instance.
1.7.5.4.5.1.2.1. Con: This is false equivalency, ear piercing is reversible as piercings heal; not to mention it is [still considered bad practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_ear_piercing#Age_Restrictions). A cleft palate is a deformity, ergo correction cannot be compared because the foreskin is not a deformity and does not usually require correction.
1.7.5.4.5.2. Pro: The simple fact that it is considered acceptable to perform an unnecessary operation without anaesthetic, using methods that are tantamount to torture; as well as the clear lack of regard for the bodily autonomy and safety of male babies are both signs of misandry.
1.7.5.4.5.3. Pro: Male circumcision is much more widespread than female circumcision and is considered more acceptable despite the barbaric methods used to carry it out.
1.7.5.4.6. Con: The motivations behind an action are irrelevant. Circumcision involves mutilation of the body and should therefore be banned in the same way other, non-consensual, body mutilation is.
1.7.5.4.6.1. Con: Motivations do matter. Someone who is motivated by misogynistic reasons is doing something worse than someone doing so for religious reasons: they are intentionally causing harm, not just doing what they believe \(according to their religion\) to be the best thing to do. This is why courts regularly consider motivations in sentencing.
1.7.5.4.6.1.1. Pro: Societies should punish wrongdoers. Wrongdoing includes the action as well as the motive. Someone who engages in FGM causes the harm of the action itself, in addition to having the desire to cause it to further a misogynistic viewpoint. Circumcision may cause harm, but people who do it are trying to do what is best as they believe it to be the correct thing to do.
1.7.5.4.6.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.4.1.
1.7.5.4.6.1.1.2. Con: Those who perform FGM do not do it out of sheer cruelty. It is performed \([typically on pre-teen girls](https://www.path.org/files/FGM-The-Facts.htm), not infants\) as a rite of passage to conform to their cultural beliefs and traditions. That their cultural beliefs are misogynistic is irrelevant. The core motivation is the same as western infant vasectomy; cultural conformity.
1.7.5.4.6.1.1.2.1. Con: Though, this is not counter-argument to [the original argument](https://www.kialo.com/should-infant-circumcision-be-banned-13673/13673.0=13673.1+13673.2+13673.24-13673.36). So that the motivation is misogynistic is relevant.
1.7.5.4.6.1.2. Con: Someone who murders his wife because he caught her cheating is no less guilty of murder than someone who murdered his wife because he hates women. Murder is murder, just like mutilation is mutilation.
1.7.5.4.6.1.2.1. Con: There are many circumstantial issues such as motive and intention that go into classifying whether a crime is a murder of first degree or manslaughter \(among others\).
1.7.5.4.6.1.2.2. Con: This argument is irrelevant since that "someone" didn't intend anything good for his wife in either case. Actually it's very misleading and puts the case of circumcision in a bad light for completely illogical reasons.
1.7.5.4.7. Pro: FGM is done solely to restrict female sexuality and play into ideas of 'purity' and 'modesty'. Circumcision is done to fulfil a religious practice and / or to provide health benefits.
1.7.5.4.7.1. Con: Certain [reasons](http://www.stopfgmmideast.org/background/islam-or-culture/) for justifying FGM are religious.
1.7.5.5. Con: Circumcision is not a synonym for genital mutilation. Rather female circumcision term was replaced with the mutilation term in scientific [terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation#Terminology) to emphasize the differences of the referred procedures around 1990.
1.7.5.5.1. Con: As you point out, female circumcision wasn’t always considered genital mutilation but it still was mutilation. In the future what we might consider ok now may be considered mutilation. The fact that male circumcision isn’t defined as genital mutilation doesn’t mean it won’t be in the future and isn’t mutilation now.
1.7.5.5.2. Con: By the same accounts female circumcision is classified mutalation could also refer to male circumcision. That is the reduction in sexual desire.
1.7.5.6. Con: The mutilation of female genitalia removes a part of the human body that plays a primary role in sexual arousal and self esteem.
1.7.5.7. Con: -> See 1.7.5.1.2.
1.7.6. Con: Many medical procedures sound gruesome if described literally, but this does not necessarily mean they are bad.
1.7.6.1. Con: [The second listed definition of the word "Mutilate"](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/mutilate) reads: "to deprive \(a person or animal\) of a limb or other essential part."

The word "deprive" is what separates something like Circumcision from another procedure like a leg amputation. Context and Intent define the necessity of the operation, and therefore whether it is considered mutilation.
1.7.6.2. Con: This procedure is usually performed without anaesthetic and infants have to be strapped down to undergo it. The tissue that is forcefully separated from the glands is akin to the same tissue that joins [fingernails to the nail beds](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/myths-about-circumcision-you-likely-believe), separating the fingernails from the nail beds is a [common form of torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denailing).
1.7.6.2.1. Pro: [Only 45% of practitioners responding to a survey use anaesthetic.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9606247)
1.7.6.3. Con: The difference between a gruesome procedure that is good and a gruesome procedure that is bad is defined by context \(necessity\) and intent of the procedure.
1.7.6.3.1. Pro: For example, a limb amputation due to irreversible damage is a necessary procedure, yet the amputation of a healthy/functional but otherwise identical limb is bad and would then be considered mutilation.
1.7.6.3.2. Con: In the case of circumcision, the context is an important religious procedure and / or something which may bring health benefits to the child. In both instances, these are positive contexts and intentions.
1.7.6.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2. Pro: The choice to circumcise is a religious right.
1.7.6.3.2.2.1. Pro: A ban on circumcision represents a pure Christian-secular universalistic perspective and ignores normative \(religious\) pluralism. [Reut Paz' argument on the Cologne circumcision judgement](https://verfassungsblog.de/cologne-circumcision-judgment-blow-liberal-legal-pluralism/)
1.7.6.3.2.2.1.1. Con: The thesis does not discuss a ban on circumcision altogether, but rather a ban on circumcising infants who have no say in the matter. Circumcising other people without their consent represents a individual's religious perspective and ignores normative \(religious\) pluralism.
1.7.6.3.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.7.6.3.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.2.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2.5. Con: Religious rights are considered an insufficient justification for female circumcision. To give this as a reason for male circumcision creates a double-standard.
1.7.6.3.2.2.6. Con: Religions, as a set of beliefs unable to be proven true, carry only faith as basis for their claimed rights and should never be made into law since we can't challenge them via rational thought in case of disagreement.
1.7.6.3.2.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.6.3.1.2.
1.7.6.3.2.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8. Pro: Banning circumcision would be an act of discrimination against the religions and cultures which practice it.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1. Pro: Banning religious traditions alienates religious people and the rest of the society.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.1. Con: There has to be a limit to this. Some religions in the past and even today include things we consider unacceptable now, like human sacrifice, witch hunts, and slavery.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.1.2. Con: Though none of those things had any benefits for those acted upon, nor were they done with the intentions of doing those acted upon any good – both of which are true for \(male\) circumcision.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.1.2.1. Con: Let’s presume good intentions behind circumcisions, but benefits being conferred by it is only an opinion \(unproven and possibly unprovable\), not a fact. While the deaths and mutilations mentioned above were quite factual.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.1.2.2. Con: We may or may not agree with the choices made in the past, but many of those things were done with a greater good in mind. Both witch burnings and the acts of the Spanish inquisition were done to enforce uniformity, with a stable state as the end goal \(just to name an example\). The value of individual life we have now is a product of later times.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.1.3. Con: This is a straw-man claim. The equivocation of circumcision and murder is an extreme caricature of the arguments seeking to support circumcision. Religious rituals that violate the law are prosecutable. Circumcision is not a criminal act.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.1.3.1. Con: Any kind of bodily mutilation practice of the infants with no medical need is at least suspicious and is subject to be considered as a crime, whatever the motives are.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.1.4. Con: There also has to be a limit to the power of the state to impose its will upon the people. The questions the state should ask itself should be whether the practice is comparably harmful to witch hunts and ritual sacrifice and whether intervention might do more harm than good all round.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.2. Pro: It would not be possible to enforce prohibition without it being perceived by the religious community as persecution of a religious minority by a majority who hold conflicting beliefs, as in Nazi Germany.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.8.6.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.4. Pro: Alienation of religious groups has been highlighted as a key cause of [extremism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/19/british-muslims-driven-to-extremism-alienated-at-home).
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.4.1. Con: If the ties of a religious group to an illegal and outdated tradition are so strong that this causes the group to become extremist rather than leave it behind, then the root cause of the problem lies with the group, not the law.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.4.2. Con: These people can choose to migrate to countries where their traditions are legal and common instead of becoming a dangerous extremist.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.5. Pro: Very religious people may continue to circumcise their children and avoid state services such as schools and hospitals to ensure that they are not found out.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.5.1. Con: Various people consume heavy drugs and avoid hospitals to ensure they are not found out in their illegal possession thereof, but this is hardly a pro for legalizing heavy drugs.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.6. Pro: Defining circumcision as a crime may increase stigma against  [Jews](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/12/21/anti-semitism-germany-jews-discrimination-muslims-right-wing-nationalists/962383001/) and [Muslims](http://socialistreview.org.uk/348/rise-islamophobia), two groups already facing increased discrimination.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.6.1. Pro: Female genital mutilation is a noted part of Islamophobic rhetoric [\(Khalil, p. 43\)](https://digitalrepository.trincoll.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1537&context=theses). While this may be acceptable in the context of such a horrific procedure, the harms of circumcision do not justify this risk.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.6.2. Pro: Framing a fundamental tenet of Jewish belief as mutilation may lead people to infer that the Jewish faith itself is a violent or immoral one. This may negatively affect how they regard that faith's adherents.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.7. Pro: Even if the justification used by the government is a medical one, the historical association between the banning of circumcision and the persecution of religious peoples - particularly the Jews, is likely to strengthen perceptions of persecution for religious reasons.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.7.1. Con: Antisemitism already existed worldwide long before World War 2. The ban on circumcision in these cases was an effect/byproduct of this antisemitism ramping up in intensity, not a cause.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.7.2. Con: This is both a historical fallacy and retrospective determinism. The fact that the ban of circumcision in the past can be connected to persecution, does not mean it is likely \(much less guaranteed\) to happen again if the other causes are not present.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.7.3. Pro: The Roman Empire identified Jews for persecution by checking to see if men were circumcised [\(Remondino, pp. 63-69\)](https://books.google.ie/books?id=VS-2aLdskbAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false).
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.7.3.1. Con: Remondino was not a historian, and does not cite any historical sources about these events.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.7.3.2. Con: Remondino, even as a doctor has made some claims about both circumcision and other medical issues that would be seen as [absurd](http://www.circumstitions.com/remondino.html) and possibly even get him an occupation ban today.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.7.4. Pro: As non-Jews in continental Europe generally were not circumcised, [Nazi](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/hidden-children-of-the-holocasut) and collaborationist police commonly checked males apprehended in raids to see if they were circumcised.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.7.4.1. Con: The Nazis had several other ways to track down Jews. Jews were often segregated, living in separate parts of cities, working in different professions, and in many countries dressed traditionally. [Census records](https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/languages/dutch/pdf/article_croes.pdf) \(or lack thereof\) also proved to be a large factor.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.7.4.2. Con: The Nazis considered Jews to be more than just a religious group, but a seperate race. Many people were classified as Jews on the basis of ancestry, even if they weren't Jewish in the religious sense and therefore not circumcized.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4. Pro: The state should not be able to influence religious practice.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.1. Pro: Any punishment by a government would be unethical.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.1.1. Con: Child abuse is already punishable by law, especially when it leaves permanent damage.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.2. Con: -> See 1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.3. Con: Religion is a personal held belief and should not be given a free pass.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.4. Con: The state should be able to prevent religious people from forcing surgery upon others without consent.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5. Con: Religious rights are not absolute.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.1. Con: It cannot be said that religious rights end at some ethic line defined by a completely different set of values, since this is a religious matter and those other values aren't necessarily more important than those of religious people.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.1.1. Con: There must be a compulsory common minimum of rules for peaceful coexistence in a society, which must not be overridden in the name of religion. And ideally this common minimum should be a secular state, which safeguards rights and freedoms, including freedom of religion without infringing the rights of others, freedom from religion, and saving religious groups from each other and the irreligious from the zealots.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.2. Pro: The state often restricts religious freedom if it violates someone else's freedom. If a religion is opposed to homosexuality, that does not mean followers of that religion are always allowed to infringe on the freedoms of homosexuals.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.2.1. Con: By that logic the state should also interfere with the way parents are raising their children to ensure that no morals are implanted into the child's identity so much that the child won't be able to change them later in life.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.2.1.1. Con: The state and the community has a justifiable interest in preventing people from raising their children to become suicide bombers, for example. Any situation where people live together \(i.e. every society\) inevitable poses some boundaries to individuals' freedoms, including parents' authority over their children.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.2.1.2. Con: In some cases, the state does interfere in how parents raise their children.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.2.1.3. Pro: It's debatably even worse, since the children have no chance of knowing whether those morals are truly important to them or if they are just so deeply implanted into their minds and personality because of how their parents brainwashed them that they think they are important.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.3. Pro: Rights are rarely absolute, and often restricted if granting someone one right harms another \(for example, hate speech law exists to protect people even if it violates the freedom of expression of another\).
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.3.1. Con: Hate speech is legal in the U.S. because of the 1st Amendment. [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/06/19/supreme-court-unanimously-reaffirms-there-is-no-hate-speech-exception-to-the-first-amendment/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.6d649a08c743)
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.4. Con: In the U.S. religious practices and ceremonies that do not include criminal violence are absolute. It is a pinnacle right guaranteed by the constitution.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.4.1. Con: It is criminal violence to remove bodily organs from people without their consent. Infant circumcision is no exception.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.4.1.1. Con: If an infant has tonsils or an appendix removed then by the logic of this claim, that is similarly criminal violence because it would not have the consent of the infant.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.4.1.1.1. Con: Medically necessary surgeries are not on the same level as cosmetic ones. It's the same reason a doctor can perform emergency procedures without you signing paperwork prior.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.4.1.1.1.1. Con: That claim prejudges circumcision as cosmetic. Not all surgeries on tonsils and appendixes are emergent. Some are preventative but with parental consent, they are not criminal.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.6. Pro: The state should represent all citizens; by restricting the practices of certain religions it necessarily prioritises other ones.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.6.1. Con: The state's duty is to safeguard people's rights and liberty, including staving off threats to one's physical integrity motivated by the religious affiliation of others \(e.g. one's parents\). If you belong to a different faith to your parents \(or to none\), you wouldn't want to carry around a sign of their religion all your life.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.6.2. Con: It is unacceptable for people to vindicate the right to commit crimes against others under the guise of their own religious freedom.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.7. Pro: States should facilitate individual freedoms as best they can; restricting one's ability to practice religion limits their freedom.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.7.1. Con: One's religious freedom pertains to their own lives, and ends where someone else's life is concerned. To put it another way: you cannot \(must not\) make religious choices for others.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.7.2. Con: States should facilitate individual freedoms as best they can, which includes protecting individuals' freedom of conscience from being encroached upon \(i.e. being subjected to female genital mutilation against their will and informed consent\).
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.7.3. Pro: Religious freedom is of incredible importance, as followers of a religion believe that the rules associated with it are set by a divine power which supersedes the state.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.7.3.1. Con: Freedom of religion also implies the freedom from other people's religion.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.7.3.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.3.5.2.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.8. Pro: States do not know better than religious doctrine, in terms of what is the correct practice for a religion.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.8.1. Con: State governments are to have the best interest for society at heart when creating laws and regulations. Some religious practices are detrimental to a functional society, and must be curtailed. Slavery, discrimination, religious authority over non-participants, etc. are examples.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.8.2. Pro: States in their current form are relatively new and have not existed for most of time. Religion has a long history, often based in what is believed to be the word of God.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.8.2.1. Con: Historical religious practice is often based on the social setting of the time.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.9. Pro: Churches and states should be separate.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.9.1. Pro: Due to the novel idea of freedom on conscience the state should maintain a secularly based order precisely to avoid promoting one religion above others.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.9.2. Pro: Interaction between the two allows for religions which dominate to influence the state's policies at the expense of smaller religions which are often viewed in a negative light.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.9.3. Pro: Interaction and influence by one religion on the state enforces the will of that particular religion on citizens who do not subscribe to its beliefs.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.9.4. Con: There are perfectly functioning countries where the church and state are not separate.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.9.4.1. Pro: There are [many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion#Current_state_religions) where religions such as Christianity, Islam or Buddhism are constitutionally enshrined as state religions. This includes several European states.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10. Con: States have a duty to their citizens and a common welfare, irrespective of the beliefs they may hold.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.8.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2. Pro: When someone holds a belief or acts in a way which harms another, then the state must intervene.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2.1. Pro: It must be the state, not another actor who intervenes, as the state is the only one with the ability to enforce the law and common good.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2.2. Pro: States owe a duty to all citizens, as the state only gets its power through being voted in and resources through taxation.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2.2.1. Con: The State is not a being and cannot "owe a duty" or "get power".
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2.2.1.1. Con: The State is a form of contract that creates obligations by the system to the members of the State. These obligations are owed and acted upon by members of the State to whom the power is delegated. As these "cogs in the system" are replaceable, it is the State that owes a duty and has the power to abide by its duty, in effect.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2.2.1.1.1. Con: The State \(a monopoly on violent force within a geographic area\) is not a form of [contract](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/contract). Contracts require an agreement. States do not.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: If one does not agree with the rules imposed by the State, they face violence, but even statists routinely face violence at the hands of "agents of the State" and there are no repercussions.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: "State agents" exempt cronies from prescribed violence in order to retain support required to maintain power.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: Contracts are the antithesis of "the State".
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2.2.1.2. Pro: The State is not a being because it does not exist and beings exist.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2.2.2. Con: Democratic States only serve the interest of the majority at the expense of the minority, so if they "owe a duty" to all citizens, they fail to deliver on that duty by design.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.10.2.2.3. Con: Since only people may delegate authority to States, and no person or group of people may "tax" others, no State may be given the authority to tax.
1.7.6.3.2.2.8.5. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.7.6.3.2.2.9. Con: Religious rights only extend to personal actions. A person cannot have religious rights over another's body.
1.7.6.3.2.2.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.
1.7.6.3.2.2.10. Con: It would only make it an inherent right in a theocracy like Iran. Freedom of religion, on the other hand, doesn't imply freedom to alter bodies of the others because one's god says so.
1.7.6.3.2.2.11. Pro: Banning a [15000 years old](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.0830s1001.x) established religious, cultural and hygienic practice that does not violate any universally recognized human right is, simply putting, intended tyranny of a loud minority against the will of a quiet majority.
1.7.6.3.2.2.11.1. Con: The age of the religious/cultural belief, that it does not violate a universally recognised human right or the opposing opinion coming from a loud minority does not mean circumcision should not be banned. By this logic, slavery would never have been abolished.
1.7.6.3.2.2.12. Con: If we allow an authority, such as a parent, to perform such an act on their child, we have to allow authorities, such as police and judges, to perform such an act on the people they are an authority over. Those police and/or judges may have religious beliefs, such as Sharia law, that would allow cutting off your hand for theft.
1.7.6.3.2.2.13. Pro: In obeying god's instructions, believers can find rest and peace. Even if other people don't understand their view on life.
1.7.6.3.2.2.14. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.7.6.3.2.2.15. Con: Rights are statements written in law texts or international treaties. Virtually no countries have any law texts defining that circumcising your child is a right.
1.7.6.3.2.2.15.1. Con: Some rights may be codified, granted and defended by Governments.  Other rights, including the right to the free exercise of religion are typically described as Natural Rights or [Human Rights](http://Www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) that do not come from a Government, but are inherent to all humans regardless of the Government of the location they occupy.  Several countries also codify and defend these rights.
1.7.6.3.2.2.15.2. Con: The first amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof \[...\]" which indirectly makes circumcising your child a right.[billofrightsinstitute.org](https://www.billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/bill-of-rights/)
1.7.6.3.2.2.15.2.1. Con: The first amendment was adopted in 1791, yet it did not prevent a criminalization of self-mortification practices performed during [the Sun Dance](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sun-Dance) in 1883, persisting up to the present day.
1.7.6.3.2.2.15.2.2. Con: The discussion is not limited to the US affairs.
1.7.6.3.2.2.16. Con: The right to bodily autonomy means such a right ends where the child's rights begin. Such is the case for female circumcision as well.
1.7.6.3.2.2.16.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.7.6.3.2.2.16.2. Con: -> See 1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2.17. Pro: If parents are allowed to impose religious beliefs and practices on their young children in other ways, then they should also be allowed to impose the surgical procedures that are mandated by those religious beliefs.
1.7.6.3.2.2.17.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.1.1.3.
1.7.6.3.2.2.17.2. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.1.1.1.4.
1.7.6.3.2.2.17.3. Con: Other indoctrinations, although arguably reprehensible, do not violate bodily autonomy. They cannot be compared to permanent unnecessary surgical interventions.
1.7.6.3.2.2.18. Con: -> See 1.7.6.3.2.2.8.4.5.
1.7.6.3.2.2.19. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.3.5.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20. Con: The choice not to be circumcised is an identical religious right. Making this choice for a child before they are able to consent to such a religious choice on their own violates the child's own rights.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.2. Con: A child is the legal responsibility of their guardian until they turn 18.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.2.1. Con: The responsibility of mutilation should carry consequences just like any other type of abuse.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.2.1.1.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.2.3. Con: The pretense of an existing law should not be used as an objective assessment of morality, or as justification of an action within an inherently moral argument.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.2.4. Pro: Until a child turns 18, the parent or guardian is legally responsible for making all important life decisions, including medical procedures and treatments.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.2.4.1. Con: That does not give the parent the right to make the child undergo any procedure.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.3. Pro: Banning infant circumcision protects the religious freedom of children by preventing them from undergoing irreversible procedures based on the beliefs of a religion they may not grow up to follow.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.3.1. Con: It's not just a right but an obligation to try to pass to the children one's base values and heritage.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.3.1.1. Con: There is no basis to claim it is an "obligation" instead of a right. Parents are not supposed to be forced to impose anything on their children.
1.7.6.3.2.2.20.3.1.2. Con: The problem is that circumcision is irreversible. If the child later rejects their Jewish religion, they will be unable to reject the circumcision. Thus, it is different from merely passing on religious viewpoints, for example.
1.7.6.4. Pro: It's a matter of perspective. To some, the act of circumcision is one of the most important and beautiful events in a person's life, while to others it's the most gruesome. This puts the values of different groups of people up against each other, but one side will always think that their own values are worth the most—obviously.
1.7.7. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.3.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.
1.7.8. Pro: -> See 1.7.5.1.
1.7.9. Con: Mutilation is a negatively charged word, and so to justify using this word you need to first establish that circumcision is in fact bad. If you don't establish that, even if it's technically "mutilation" by a dictionary definition it still isn't the appropriate term to use. Calling it so just makes it sound immoral because of the word's connotations without having to provide actual arguments. It's just a trick of semantics.
1.7.9.1. Con: Google [defines](https://www.google.com/search?q=mutilation) mutilation as "the infliction of serious damage on something". Removing an important and sensitive piece of an infant's body can be deeply traumatic in a number of ways. It can be deeply damaging and it is absolutely serious.
1.7.9.2. Con: This misses the point of the parent claim, which is precisely that circumcision is sometimes equated with mutilation because that word is negatively charged. Female genital mutilation has a negative connotation because it is banned. To spell it out explicitly: if circumcision is sometimes equated with genital mutilation, then circumcision may actually be genital mutilation, and if so it should be banned.
1.7.9.3. Con: The connotations of words are not necessarily inaccurate. Negative connotations may be precise, and accurate. The real issue is whether the negative connotations of 'mutilation' are appropriate to circumcision, not that those negative connotations are present to begin with.
1.7.9.4. Con: The same could be said about not calling it mutilation.
1.8. Con: A ban on circumcision will lead to more dangerous illegal circumcisions to meet the demand.
1.8.1. Con: A severe penal punishment will disincentivise the practice.
1.8.1.1. Con: Severe penal punishment was used as disincentives against Jews in Nazi Germany. This would not be a good example of state intervention to control religious practices it finds repugnant, being intolerant of the religious sensibilities of its subjects.
1.8.2. Con: A ban would greatly decrease the popularity of this procedure, especially where it is not religiously motivated – where the parents merely consider it beneficial because someone said so.
1.8.2.1. Con: Awareness campaigns would be a better way to stop this practice for non-religious reasons, instead of banning it.
1.8.3. Con: Parents set on circumcision may wait for the child to be able to consent.
1.8.4. Pro: In France, when female FGM was made [illegal](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237718923_LEGISLATION_IN_EUROPE_REGARDING_FEMALE_GENITAL_MUTILATION_AND_THE_IMPLEMENTATION_OF_THE_LAW_IN_BELGIUM_FRANCE_SPAIN_SWEDEN_AND_THE_UK), it went underground. Parents began sending their children to visit relatives in other countries, during school holidays, [to have the procedure done](https://womensenews.org/2016/03/in-france-fgm-is-reason-to-fear-homelands-seek-asylum/). The same may happen to male children should this law be applied to them too.
1.8.5. Pro: Religious [justifications](http://www.medic8.com/healthguide/circumcision/cultural-religious-reasons.html) for circumcision are essential aspects of many faiths. For many religious people, especially [Jews](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/circumcision_1.shtml), a ban will not be enough to deter them from circumcising their children.
1.8.5.1. Con: Jews accept adult circumcision and eventually, with passing generations, Jews can change their own practices like they did with [polygyny](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/558598/jewish/Does-Jewish-Law-Forbid-Polygamy.htm).
1.8.5.2. Con: Even Islamic scholars [hold the position](http://www.dar-alifta.org/Foreign/ViewFatwa.aspx?ID=5940) that a person converting to Islam may not be obliged to be circumcised if he fears unwanted consequences.
1.8.5.3. Con: Just because some parents might prioritise religion over their child's health doesn't mean circumcision should be allowed to continue.
1.8.5.3.1. Pro: A tougher response, such as arresting those who perform illegal circumcisions, would be a better response than inaction.
1.8.5.3.2. Con: It's not a given that circumcision damages a child's health. There are health positives to circumcision, and no downsides, especially on a long time horizon.
1.8.5.3.2.1. Pro: Since there are equally compelling medical and scientific arguments for and against circumcision, there is no basis to ban this as a religious practice.
1.8.5.4. Con: No religion should be privileged by the law. Some religions in the world might say that we should allow female genitalia mutilation, too. Hence, if we do not wish to grant those cultures permission to mutilate genitalia, then we should not grant popular religions the permission to do so, just because they are popular. That is not how our justice system is supposed to work.
1.8.6. Pro: It would be exceptionally difficult to enforce a ban on circumcision.
1.8.6.1. Con: There are multiple ways to ban infant circumcision, and many ways to make such a ban much more enforceable \(extended statute of limitations, punishing those who had custody of the infant, etc.\)
1.8.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.
1.8.6.3. Pro: Parents may bring their infant abroad to have them circumcised, in which case it may be difficult for the state to mount an effective prosecution.
1.8.6.3.1. Pro: In the analogous case of female genital mutilation, the [UK](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/416323/Fact_sheet_-_FGM_-_Act.pdf) was unable to prosecute a number of cases because the individuals involved were not permanent UK residents at the time of the procedure.
1.8.6.4. Pro: Investigating whether or not circumcision has occurred would require a significant invasion of the privacy of families and individuals, which would come at a considerable expense to the state.
1.8.6.4.1. Con: During any infant physical a doctor could immediately, and without invasion of privacy, ascertain the status of circumcision. Such physicals are common before age one.
1.8.6.4.2. Con: The difficulty or ease of law enforcement has no bearing on the rectitude of a law.
1.8.6.4.2.1. Pro: Most laws and regulations are changed at some point in their use. Each time those changes are proposed, the changes are opposed by groups who claim the practices in question are part of their culture or a tradition. While painful for some, change can ultimately make the group as a whole stronger and happier, even if it comes at a very high upfront cost.
1.8.6.5. Pro: As of March 2018, there has never been a successful prosecution of female genital mutilation in the [UK](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/07/reported-cases-fgm-rise-sharply-uk-no-court-convictions), with only two cases ever reaching court. There is no reason to believe that the prosecution of circumcision would be more effective.
1.8.6.5.1. Con: This only means that British attitude to law enforcement regarding this and [similar affairs](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/sharia-law-uk-courts-muslim-women-rights-few-compared-islamic-countries-religious-rulings-quran-a8064796.html) should stop failing to abide by its own standards.
1.8.6.6. Con: While it may be difficult to punish circumcisions after they have already happened, preventing doctors from carrying out circumcisions in hospitals would be a simple policy for the government to implement.
1.8.6.6.1. Pro: In one [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576965/), the most prevalent reasons given by parents for the circumcision of their sons were hygiene \(61.9% of parents\) and prevention of infection or cancer \(44.8%\). This indicates that most parents would not circumcise their child if they could not do it in a safe setting.
1.8.6.7. Con: Even if prosecutions for circumcisions are rare, if the punishment for circumcising an infant is high enough, most parents will not take the risk.
1.8.6.7.1. Con: If the punishment for practicing the religion that has been part of one's ancestry for generations in that country is high enough, then the discrimination will rather push Jews to move to Israel, and Muslims to Arab countries.
1.8.6.8. Con: -> See 1.8.6.4.2.
1.8.7. Con: We could see the overall number of circumcised children decrease dramatically if we treated child circumcision as severely as child female genital mutilation.
1.8.7.1. Con: Reductions in Female Genital Mutilation in response to international condemnation, legal prohibitions and intervention have been real but modest and have failed to outstrip population growth in some practicing populations. \(UNICEF report\) [google.co.uk](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGMC_2016_brochure_final_UNICEF_SPREAD.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjJ4pWz-ZHbAhVSjqQKHaBjCb4QFjAAegQICRAB&usg=AOvVaw17NSAK_bcRYLefdibeCDcF)
1.8.7.2. Pro: Religion was cited as the primary motivation of parents for the circumcision of their child in less than [10%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576965/) of instances in one US study. This indicates that even if religious parents continue to circumcise their children, the reduction in the overall number of children circumcised will be significant.
1.8.7.2.1. Con: This would result in criminalising a significant minority of Jews for following their profoundly held religious beliefs in what God requires of them.
1.8.7.2.2. Con: This law will have been imposed upon them by Gentiles, just as laws were imposed upon them in Nazi Germany without their consent or democratic participation.
1.8.7.2.3. Con: Countries with larger Jewish or Islamic populations will not see as significant a decline in the number of circumcisions.
1.8.7.3. Con: Severe punishments for parents who circumcise their children may hurt the wellbeing of those children even more, while the alleged damage of circumcision cannot be undone.
1.8.7.4. Con: -> See 1.8.6.5.
1.8.7.5. Pro: In the 20-30 years since FGM was banned in most developed nations, there has been a [noted increase](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/convictions-for-female-genital-mutilation-france-100-uk-nil-8722934.html) in negative perceptions of the procedure. It is likely the same would occur for circumcision.
1.8.7.5.1. Con: Negative perceptions of circumcision could be used as reasons to justify anti-semitism.
1.8.7.6. Con: A circumcision done by an untrained person is significantly worse than one done by a doctor, so even if we reduce the number of circumcisions significantly it might still increase overall harm.
1.8.8. Con: By this standard we should have no laws.
1.8.8.1. Pro: -> See discussion #6144: Anarchy is the only ethical system of society.
1.8.8.2. Pro: Laws necessarily restrict human behaviour. Their nature is to prevent actions which would occur otherwise, there is no need for a law to prevent something bad which would never occur.
1.8.8.2.1. Con: Laws are enforced arbitrarily.
1.8.8.2.2. Con: While it is true that laws are implemented to regulate existing human behaviour, this does not mean that laws should be implemented when they cannot be enforced. For instance, [drunk driving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunk_driving_law_by_country) laws are well enforced around the world, whereas the criminalisation of [suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation) is rare, mostly because it is almost impossible to enforce effectively.
1.8.8.2.2.1. Con: Nothing can be done to persons who die in accidents because they were drunk, but survivors are prosecuted. Similarly, one could prosecute victims of failed suicides, and that was a common practice in the Western World well into the XIX century. Suicides were decriminalized for humane reasons.
1.8.8.3. Con: Laws do not simply regulate actions which society considers 'good' or 'bad'. Rather, they ought to be implemented when they are enforceable and do not create other significant harms as a result of their implementation. Many laws fulfill these criteria. A ban on circumcision would not.
1.8.8.3.1. Con: Often states lack resources or have other difficulties enforcing laws fully, yet this does not stop those laws existing. Sexual Assault law has an incredibly low [prosecution](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system) rate, yet it is a law nonetheless.  By this logic, only laws which could be perfectly enforced would ever exist.
1.8.8.4. Con: The argument only applies to prohibition of actions that can be made safer when done properly, and that are hard to enforce. This is very specific, certainly not every law.
1.8.8.4.1. Con: Many laws would be affected. For example, following this reasoning recreational drugs should be allowed.
1.8.8.4.1.1. Pro: -> See discussion #7100: All drugs should be legalised.
1.8.9. Pro: In light of effective alternatives to reducing the rate of circumcision, such as [educational campaigns](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/20/male-infant-circumcision-judge-practice), a ban which creates needless additional harm is unnecessary and unacceptable.
1.8.9.1. Con: Educational campaigns rely on the parent to make a decision, whereas illegality forces them to. Whilst a reduction would exist through educational means, a ban would be more effective.
1.8.9.1.1. Pro: Most people don't like to break the law. Even if a ban is not entirely effective, it would significantly reduce the number of circumcisions overall.
1.8.9.1.1.1. Con: The fact that the \(total\) number of circumcisions decreases does not imply that the number of dangerous circumcisions decreases.
1.8.9.1.1.2. Con: Given religion is an incredibly fundamental part of people's lives and identities, they often break the law or take personal risk in order to be able to practice their religion.
1.8.9.1.1.2.1. Pro: People who believe in Judaism, believe they are risking 'Karet' \(a biblical penalty with various [meanings](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/karet/) including death before the age of 60\). A fear of divine punishment will be greater than a fear of breaking the law.
1.8.9.1.1.2.1.1. Con: People often do not believe all aspects of a religious text, in particular moderately religious people. They may not believe in Karet for not circumcising their child.
1.8.9.1.1.2.1.2. Con: If circumcision is illegal, people know for certain that they will be punished by the law. They do not know for certain that they will receive divine punishment. People tend to make decisions on what they know for certain, not what they do not know for certain.
1.8.9.1.1.2.2. Pro: Christians in China take a risk of [state persecution](http://uk.businessinsider.com/chinese-authorities-demolish-christian-mega-church-in-crackdown-2018-1?r=US&IR=T) by practising their religion.
1.8.9.1.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.8.7.2.
1.8.9.1.1.3. Con: The cultural norms fostered by a change in the law, as opposed to legal deterrents of a ban, are likely to be outweighed by the significant cultural forces which lead people to circumcise infants in the status quo.
1.8.9.1.1.3.1. Pro: The failure of similar laws prohibiting [female genital mutilation](https://www.opendemocracy.net/liv-t-nnessen-samia-el-nagar-sharifa-gafar-bamkar/paper-tiger-law-forbidding-fgm-in-sudan) in Sudan due to strong, indigenous cultural support of the procedure point to the failure of laws to undermine previously existing societal support.
1.8.9.1.1.4. Con: Circumcisions held in homes and religious [places of worship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_milah#Time_and_place) are already common. Under a ban, more circumcisions would occur in this setting rather than a hospital to the detriment of the circumcised infants' safety.
1.8.9.1.1.4.1. Pro: [Infection](https://www.circumcision-london.co.uk/infected-circumcision/) due to circumcision is more likely in an unsterilized environment.
1.8.9.1.1.4.2. Pro: Parents wishing to circumcise their child in a home environment will be unable to seek medical advice from a professional if a ban is introduced.
1.8.9.1.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.8.6.6.1.
1.8.9.1.1.4.4. Pro: Effective policing of private properties to prevent circumcisions would be highly unlikely.
1.8.9.1.1.4.4.1. Con: Policing of private properties is not required, if the inevitability of punishment is upheld. Persons are less likely to circumcise their infants if they know that if it becomes apparent, they will be accused of committing a crime.
1.8.9.1.1.5. Pro: Laws play a large role in the construction of [social norms](https://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/6293/social%20norms.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). Legal compliance is typically viewed positively, regardless of the law in question. A ban on circumcision would aid in the construction of a social norm against circumcision as a result.
1.8.9.1.1.6. Pro: A ban on circumcision would send a strong signal to the public that it is not a necessary or desirable procedure. The strong effect of government policy on individual behaviour in this manner is well [documented](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/36541/1/Disspaper59.pdf).
1.8.9.1.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.7.5.
1.8.9.1.1.6.2. Con: While it will indeed demonize the action of male circumcision, it will mostly do so amongst people who do not practice circumcision, and they'll try to force those who want to practice the ritual to stop or to criminalize them.
1.8.10. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.3.2.2.8.1.5.
1.8.11. Pro: -> See 1.8.9.1.1.4.
1.8.12. Con: -> See 1.8.9.1.1.
1.8.13. Con: By this same logic, FGM should not be outlawed either.
1.8.13.1. Con: FGM is not a religious practice, but a social and ethnic one. The practical reasons claimed for it are morally unacceptable and ignorant. Education should reduce and eventually eradicate the practice. Such education should be accompanied by declaring the practice illegal and if necessary enforcing the law. This is not strictly true of circumcision.
1.8.13.1.1. Con: Male circumcision in modern medical practice was [originally proposed](http://whale.to/a/john_harvey.html) to help prevent masturbation in young boys. Which seems similar to the justifications for FGM in Eastern countries, as they are both intended to reduce pleasure.
1.8.13.1.1.1. Con: Male circumcision in modern practice was originally proposed by religious texts as acts of care for one's children's relation to God – which is an act of love and care. Hence this claim can only address the purely non-religious act of male circumcision.
1.8.13.2. Con: FGM is never safe and therefore outlawing it did not make it worse, since the procedures weren't performed by doctors in the first place and still isn't after the ban. Male circumcision is often done by doctors, but a ban will make that option impossible.
1.8.13.2.1. Con: There are [variations of FGM](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/overview/en/) that are just as invasive as male circumcision, or even less in some cases. Yet these are still illegal.
1.8.13.2.1.1. Con: The linked source supports in no way what your argument states. On the contrary, it emphasises how much more severe FGM is than male circumcision.
1.8.13.2.2. Con: FGM would be safer if performed by a surgeon in a medical setting.
1.8.13.2.2.1. Con: The overall procedure is very bad in almost every aspect of it, and allowing it would lead to more frequent occurrences of it.
1.8.13.2.2.1.1. Pro: FGM has no benefits, just as removing a kidney doesn't. But we don't allow for parents to unnecessarily remove their children's kidneys just to make the procedure safer.
1.8.13.2.3. Con: There are kinds of FGM that are safe enough to be legal in developed countries. [Type 4 FGM](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/overview/en/) includes practices such as piercing, pricking, and cosmetic surgery such as labiaplasty.
1.8.14. Con: Circumcision in Judaism is not traditionally performed by medical professionals but religious practitioners. It is those same people who would continue performing the surgery regardless of legislation. Therefore, the back-alley argument doesn't apply here.
1.8.14.1. Con: Those religious practitioners are most often registered as being qualified to carry out such a procedure. A ban will most likely lead to these people being under close eye by the government - resulting in the same outcome as before.
1.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.3.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.1.8.1.10.2.5.1.
1.11. Con: -> See 1.7.6.3.2.2.
1.12. Pro: Circumcision presumes to improve upon evolution, yet without evidence and for nothing but cultural reasons.
1.12.1. Con: You don't need your appendix either as evolution is far from perfect.  - Removal of the foreskin has no deleterious effects, and has small but proven medical benefits.
1.12.1.1. Con: It is true that the appendix is not necessary either, but it is also not common practice to prophylactically remove appendices. They can be removed if they become a health risk, we could treat foreskins in the same way - leave them in place unless an intervention is required.
1.12.1.2. Con: Appendix is crucial for the [immune system](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/84937.php) formation at infancy.
1.12.2. Pro: The genitals evolved on humans and other animals over millions of years, and just a few millennia ago some tribes decided that they should be cut up.
1.12.3. Con: Evolution produces imperfect designs and there's no reason why we wouldn't be able to modify humans to improve the design.
1.12.3.1. Con: In general the designs produced by evolution are highly optimized. The default position should be that these designs are correct, not incorrect. The onus is on the proponent of circumcision to show 1\) why foreskins are a mistaken design and 2\) why circumcision is an improvement.
