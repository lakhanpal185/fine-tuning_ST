Discussion Title: Should God Have Tested Job?

1. God Should Not Have Tested Job.
1.1. Con: We, as humans, are incapable of meaningfully challenging God's decisions.
1.1.1. Pro: The very core thesis of this debate presupposes the existence of God and at least the partial correctness of the Bible. Yet we read in the Bible, \(and taking even the smallest fragment of its descriptions of God to be true, it is apparent that\) [God's ways are higher than man's ways](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/isa/55.9), thereby showing the [absurdity](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1985/08/seek-not-to-counsel-the-lord?lang=eng) of challenging God's decisions.
1.1.1.1. Con: The bible is essentially a collection of stories to facilitate spiritual development. When viewed in that light the stories have greater purpose - as an instructional aid.
1.1.2. Pro: We don't have a full understanding of life and we can't judge correctly. Job said: "27.6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. ... For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?" His family is not dead. This story explains the relationships between God, Satan and humans. Job accepts the good and and the bad, remaining faithful to the principles until the end, and he becomes the winner.
1.1.3. Pro: The primary theme of the entire book of Job is that we are not in a position to judge God’s actions or how He has decided to allow the world to operate because our perspective is so limited. Indeed, God’s entire speech to Job at the end of the book carries this theme.
1.1.3.1. Con: If we are not able to judge God's actions, then we are not in a position to judge Him to be good, which means that any argument that relies on the goodness of God is invalid.
1.1.3.1.1. Con: It is true that we are not able to judge Gods actions. This is because we are unable to understand His perspective. This means that humanity indeed are not in a position \(and does not have the authority\) to judge God to be good \(or bad\).
But arguments that rely on Gods goodness *are* valid because we \(Christians\) understand that God is good \(as well as the nature of goodness\) not through intuition, but through the self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ.
1.1.3.2. Con: Given God's pride, it would make sense for Him to reinforce the idea that questioning His actions is impossible after committing questionable actions, such as wagering with Satan.
1.1.4. Con: We do not need to be all knowing to judge the actions of an all knowing being. I do not need to be a mechanic to determine that my car does not run well, or a plumber to know my toilet needs to be fixed.
1.1.4.1. Con: To judge, we may, but for our judgment to be true, we must have complete understanding. Otherwise, our judgment is erroneous and short-sighted and as a result cannot be true and is bad judgment.
1.1.5. Con: Even if we cannot know God's nature, we can at least know God's actions must be logically consistent, because nothing that is incoherent can exist.
1.1.5.1. Con: Human beings are filled with caprice and irrationality, defying the argument that incoherence is nonexistent.
Assuming that God's logical consistency is a known attribute, this argument does not contradict, but rather reinforces, the infallibility and unquestionability of God. Our own lack of logical support for God's actions does not contradict His coherence; it merely illustrates our ignorance.
1.1.5.2. Pro: A concept cannot both exist and not exist, because the two are mutually exclusive. Similarly, God cannot exist in two contradictory forms at once, because they are mutually exclusive.
1.1.5.3. Con: God being logically consistent does not contradict the fact that we cannot evaluate God's decisions on a consequentialist model, because we have limited information. God, having perfect knowledge, must always make perfect decisions. Our inability to accept them only reflects our inability to grasp them.
1.1.5.3.1. Con: There is no way to tell if God is, in fact, benevolent, especially if mortal beings are not able to make moral judgments.
1.1.5.3.1.1. Con: Adam and Eve eating the forbidden fruit granted mankind the knowledge of good and evil.
1.1.6. Con: Just because we are incapable of understanding God's decision in full, doesn't mean that a challenge is not meaningful, as though it is a way of understanding more meaningfully then blind compliance.
1.1.7. Pro: A soul alive in this universe has no business judging ANY action its Author would choose to do. It would be like Bilbo Baggins complaining about Tolkien letting so much trouble happen in Middle Earth. Any trouble defined in the story is part of the story and contributes to its purpose. Also, characters in a story are imaginary and amount to nothing compared to the Author who is the one who really exists.
1.1.8. Pro: A soul alive in this universe has no business judging ANY action its Author would choose to do or allow. It would be like a character in a book having a grievance with the book's author regarding events within. The Author can make or allow anything to happen within his own book without gaining any guilt.
1.1.9. Con: There are many times in the Old Testament where God seems to acknowledge making a mistake, such as [The Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_flood_narrative), where God concluded that humanity was so broken that it needed a reboot.
1.1.9.1. Pro: [Genesis 6:6](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%206.6) stated "And the LORD regretted that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him to His heart." This is one example of God admitting to having made a mistake.
1.1.9.2. Con: God is perfect and so cannot make mistakes as stated in the Bible "[His work is perfect. For all his ways are just, a god of faithfulness without inquity](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Deuteronomy%2032:4)"
1.1.9.2.1. Con: It is clear that God is not perfect due to examples such as "The Flood". Therefore this quote only demonstrates that the Bible is not an accurate representation of events and of God.
1.1.9.2.2. Con: From a narrative perspective, the narrators of the Bible are unreliable. It should not be assumed that they provide an accurate depiction of the character of God.
1.1.9.3. Con: [God](https://www.compellingtruth.org/God-make-mistakes.html) did not have to reboot humanity because of His own mistake but instead because of the extent to which sin had permeated the world. The entrance of sin into the world came through Eve and Satan and so was no mistake of Gods.
1.1.9.3.1. Con: Given God's omnipotence, he clearly allowed evil and sin to come into existence. The Flood appears to be God recognizing that he let in *too much* sin.
1.1.9.4. Pro: This proves that God can make mistakes and so opens up the possibility that He was wrong in the case of Job.
1.1.10. Pro: The bible is a guide for spiritual growth, not a biography of God. The spiritual lessons in Job are many but center around the common question, "Why do bad things happen to good people?" It teaches we will never know the specific reason for suffering and we should retain our faith and spiritual direction in spite of adversity.
1.1.11. Pro: God, being the most powerful, wise, and benevolent thing in existence, is in a better position to decide what actions are necessarily moral than any mortal being.
1.1.11.1. Con: We have only God's word that He is the most powerful, wise and benevolent thing in existence.
1.1.11.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.2.2.
1.1.11.2. Con: An immoral action doesn't become moral just because it is committed by someone who is benevolent. A person's intent or opinion cannot change the direct impact of what they do.
1.1.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.1.11.4. Con: In GNT, God says to Satan that Job's possessions, and later his body, "are his". This proposal implies that somehow God believed that giving control of earthly material to Satan would be a moral act.
1.1.11.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.2. Pro: Given that God rewarded Job in the end, the wager means that everyone else going forward will tie their faith to reward.
1.2.1. Pro: This story was recorded and analysed by God's followers. This demonstrates the influence Job getting rewarded for his faith will have on God's followers, as it has been told and retold as a teaching story.
1.2.1.1. Con: The analysis done by God's followers could be inaccurate, in their attempts to derive meaning from God wagering with Satan.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.2.2.
1.2.2. Con: Faith in God is not dependent upon reward.  Faith is dependent upon the strength of the belief in God alone.  This is a relationship between God and the Person and faith is the bond of that relationship.
1.2.3. Con: This presupposes the story is simply about physical reward - and that the reward was the real wealth Job was given at the end. In actuality, the overall theme of spiritual Christianity can be said to be a placement of value on 'things not seen' vs. what we see around us today. In the end, Job was given something much more precious than wealth. Knowledge. He didn't have that before he started, and perhaps would not have unless he experienced first-hand the events in the story.
1.2.4. Con: It is a false notion that the "reward for obeying God" is what incentivizes Christians to follow Christianity. That is opposite of what is being said in the book of Job. Job did not remain faithful because of the reward to follow. The reward to follow was because he remained faithful.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Arguably, Job was not so much rewarded for his piety as he was restored to the vitality and richness he had before the test.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: The ultimate reward for following God is not earthly riches, but life with Him.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: Offering heaven as a reward for following God's laws indicates that he is not interested in His followers' moral wellness.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Offering rewards in return for piety only undermines the moral "goodness" of an individual.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: 1.A perfect moral actor would follow their moral system without consideration of the punishments/rewards they'd receive.
2.Changing actions based on possible rewards or punishments prevents perfect morality.
3.Offering rewards and punishments can not improve morality, but can diminish it.
Conclusion-Therefore, offering rewards/punishments can only serve to diminish morality.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.2. Con: God does not expect the fallen humanity to be perfect moral actors - He works around our fallen nature to incentivise us to want to be better than we can be.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.3. Con: The moral goodness of an individual is always subject to a reward system, be it this way or that.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: Morals connected to a belief system emphasizing ultimate truth and goodness will lead to ultimate truth and goodness which is the reward.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: If a moral action negatively affects the person making the action, they are not being rewarded.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.3.3. Con: If a moral action has no affect on the person making the action, they are not being rewarded.
1.2.4.1.1.1.1.3.4. Con: If a moral action does positively impact the person making the action, the reward can be incidental. If the action is not taken for the purpose of receiving a reward, then the reward does not affect the morality of the action. In this way a reward system does not affect their morality.
1.2.4.1.1.1.2. Con: The point of heaven is often missed. All who make it to heaven are in search of a deeper relationship with their creator, not tangible goods that may be waiting for them if they act morally.
1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Heaven is presented as a paradise. It is not honest to say that heaven is not a reward.
1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Heaven is a reward. The closeness to God that is granted the individual is based on deeds and faith which is part of said reward.
1.2.4.2. Con: At the end of the book, God speaks directly to Job, thus nullifying any faith Job had because Job has now directly observed God's existence.
1.2.5. Pro: Job 42:12 states: “12 So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses \(Donkeys\). This shows his life was better because of the trials he endured, and job 42:16-17 says: 16After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
17 So Job died, being old and full of days.” This shows that god gave job a happy end
1.2.6. Pro: Given that God made the bet in the first place, it's likely that God cares about the motivation behind people's faith.
1.2.7. Con: Job did not know that God would reward him in the end and God was not required to do so. The moral of the story of Job is not that ‘if we do the right thing we will always receive an earthly reward’
1.2.8. Con: The moral of the story is that we cannot know, in our limited perspective, all the factors that God has to incorporate when running the world. So when we want to accuse him of being unjust \(which Job was reasonable to do, from a human perspective\) we actually cannot justifiably do so.
1.2.9. Con: This devalues the worth of a person's faith in God, given that the tale promises reward in return for faith which can make many people's faith self-motivated.
1.2.9.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.2.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.9.3. Con: One of the most common promises made by God is to follow His Word to receive eternal life; the value of faith had been reward based long before the story of Job.
1.2.9.3.1. Con: There is a difference between spiritual rewards, such as heaven, and rewards in the physical world.
1.3. Con: God used the trials of Job to reveal God more, which, to God, is a higher good than the well-being of Job
1.3.1. Con: If God is all-powerful, then he/she/it would have no reason to choose revealing God over and at the expense of the well-being of a follower and a good person.
1.3.1.1. Con: Good point - but take your statement as an example. Simply telling you he/she/it exists is not enough. You will need to experience that yourself. What you come away with at that point will be a visceral truth, not just lip-service from followers trying to convince people of their truth.
1.3.2. Con: Despite God believing that revealing Himself is a higher good that does not mean that it is. God believing in His motivation does not mean that He is right.
1.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.11.2.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Killing children is worse than not killing children.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: After telling his people not to kill in the Ten Commandments, it is hypocritical for God to kill Job's children to make a point.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: The Ten Commandments were written for the Israelites to follow, not for God. Most commandments makes no sense at all when applied to God.
1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: The bible states that there is [no being](https://www.allaboutgod.com/bible.htm?embed_path=/query&query=Isaiah%2046:9-10) like God. Therefore, no commandments intended for humans could be reasonably applied to God in the same way they might be to humans.
1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: "Thou shalt not kill" is a mistranslation of the original text. The commandment actually refers to a prohibition on [murder](https://www.str.org/articles/does-god-have-to-obey-the-ten-commandments). If God could justify his killing of Job's children as a result of a net benefit to the world or because they were sinful then it would not be fair to call what God did murder. Therefore, he is not hypocritical to kill Job's children.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Job's children were not [innocent](http://dwindlinginunbelief.blogspot.ie/2010/03/gods-107th-kiling-god-and-satan-kill.html). They were fond of drinking and partying. Job made a lot of sacrifices for them as he suspected they may be sinning.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con: If they were not innocent, God should have explicitly punished them for their behaviour rather than making their punishment a condition of Job's test.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: It is unjust to punish the innocent for the sins of the guilty.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: God recognized this when He agreed to spare the righteous Lot and his family from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: God also failed to abide by this when He drowned the world during the tale of Noah's Ark.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Job was not innocent and freely [admitted](http://www.biblebro.net/book-of-job-god-did-not-give-satan-power/) to having sinned in the past. Therefore his challenges were not torture but instead punishments.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Job says](http://www.biblebro.net/book-of-job-god-did-not-give-satan-power/) "I have sinned", "For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?" and "Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes."
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Torture can be a punishment.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3. Con: Punishment in excess of someone's sins is punishment; Job did not sin enough to justify his suffering.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: God is the only actor who can appropriately weigh up the needed punishment for any specific sin.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con: Murdering people who are related to the person who committed the sin is categorically unjust.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.4. Con: God did not decide to torture Job as punishment; God decided to torture Job to win a bet with Satan.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.4.1. Con: The two are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Taking part in a wager does not mean that Job may not have been being punished as well.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Through making their punishment a condition of Job's test He confused His message and was not a good example for His followers.
1.3.2.2.1.2.1.2. Con: It is not right to punish being fond of drinking and partying, normal human behaviours, with death.
1.3.2.2.1.3. Con: The prohibition on the shedding of blood in [Genesis 9](http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm) is based on the fact that mankind is made in God's image. One interpretation of this is that killing is wrong because doing so damages what is rightfully God's property. Given that God "owns" humans himself, he is perfectly entitled to do what he wishes with them and it is therefore not hypocritical for him to kill Job's children.
1.3.2.2.1.3.1. Pro: As God created life, He above all has the right to end Job's children's lives for whatever reason He deems fit.
1.3.2.2.1.3.1.1. Con: The idea that life is fleeting and can be ended at any time by a capricious god is probably not a great lesson to teach people.
1.3.2.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: It is only a bad lesson if it is not reality. Unfortunately in this story that is the reality of life and it is better to be aware of the world one lives in.
1.3.2.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: God explicitly told His people ["You are mine"](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-1.htm), which logically extends to Him being able to treat them as He sees fit.
1.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.1. Con: God telling someone "you are mine" does absolutely NOT mean that he is.
1.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.2. Con: Although God had the right to treat Job this way, that does not mean that He should have done it. Being able to treat people in any way He sees fit does not mean that it is morally right to treat them badly.
1.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.2.1. Con: As both an omniscient and omnibenevolent being, it is reasonable to believe that God only does things that should be done.
1.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.3.1.
1.3.2.2.1.3.2. Con: This reasoning could be used to justify killing ones own children. Creating something does not give one the right to do anything with it, especially when that something is a person.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.3.1.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: God caused the death of Job's innocent children in order to test Job. Ending young peoples lives in order to make a point is not justified.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.
1.3.2.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.3.1.
1.3.2.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.2.1.
1.3.2.2.3.4. Con: God did not cause the deaths, but He did watch. This should prompt you to seek knowledge - the fact that not only did that mean children died then - but that they die today and God is still watching. No Satan to take the blame here, just a bunch of humans. Be like Job - Ask God to answer. If he does - you might come away with knowledge - which in the end is what Job actually gained, not just the material wealth - but words spoken from God directly.
1.3.3. Pro: Gods test created proof revealing that the theology of Jobs friends was flawed and based on a misperception regarding the correlation between sin and fortune.
1.3.4. Con: All it revealed is God's need to impress Satan and His willingness to cause untold harm to achieve His own goals. That is the actions of an oppressor, to show dominion over and willingness to harm those underneath Him in order to send a message that He is greater than they are.
1.3.5. Pro: There's a reason we're referred to as "sheep". We're just not very bright. Even the best of us have terrible memories. As such, God must often times teach us things the hard way. The most challenging of trials come to those of us He knows will likely survive them, as well as be able to disburse the results thereof to observers. We learn from their mistakes, as well as their successes.

Testing Job was a great example both to Satan, as well as the rest of us. Satan knows his place now, as do we.
1.3.6. Pro: Everything that occurred, occurred for a reason. The reason for the Book of Job to me is not a test of suffering or a glorification of patience. It is simply the illustration of the truth that Gods character is immutable and worthy of worship without any reference to the world we live in, how it treats us. Job teaches us that the world and everything in it are to be viewed through the lens of Gods character, not to view God's character through the narcissistic lens of the condition of our lives.
1.3.7. Pro: Bad things happen to good people, and they should not destroy your faith or commitment to God. Job should have been tested by the events in his life because it is what happened. His response, to stay true to himself and keep trying, is the lesson of the story.
1.3.8. Pro: God always does what is best, and the end product of those trials was a higher faith and love for god, which is more important than anything he lost in those trials. He did get all his stuff back though
1.3.9. Con: There may have been many ways to achieve the same effect, and picking one that punishes a good man is definitely not a good idea if you want to be loved and respected.
1.3.10. Pro: Fundamentally God allowed Job to be assaulted by Satan for us all who follow after so we can see the difference between good and evil. Job is for our benefit. Ultimately, given that everything was restored 10-fold is both to his gain and our gain- restoration for him and knowledge of what God values for ourselves.
1.3.10.1. Pro: While God gives Job new children and new slaves you can never really replace taken lives. Even though Job has children again the loss of his previous children has not evaporated.
1.3.10.1.1. Pro: Due to the subjective personal connections made by people through their lives, it is impossible to truly replace one person with another in someone's eyes.
1.3.10.1.2. Pro: Job's wife becomes another victim in this instance as she is now forced to go through seven more pregnancies and births.
1.3.10.2. Con: Though his previous children seem 'lost' to him, he was not given twice as many children as he had before, as with all other property he had lost. He had only another 7 sons and three daughters, [Job.42:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job.42%3A13&version=NRSV) equal only to what he had to start with, not twice as many. [Job.1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job.1%3A2&version=NRSV)The tacit inference seems to be his previous children still exist and he will be reunited with them after his own death, so indeed he had twice as many as before of children also. \(It is just a story, and Job is fictional\).
1.3.11. Pro: People always ask why God allows evil. Understanding Job is the key to understanding why God does. Note the claim about all humans: "But Satan answered Jehovah: 'Skin for skin. A man will give everything that he has for his life, ...'" So when good people confront evil in their lives, that is also an opportunity to conquer evil with good and prove that Satan is a liar. [How Good Will Conquer Evil](https://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/w20060101/How-Good-Will-Conquer-Evil/#?insight\[search_id\]=0c51c2e8-6524-4594-9ae8-d331dcd8ca02&insight\[search_result_index\]=0)
1.3.12. Pro: God allowed Job's actions to prove Satan to be a liar. Job did not curse God ever. And every time anyone else stand fast under trial or persecution, he or she also proves that Satan is still a liar.
1.4. Con: Tests of faith are a critical part of how God decides whom to reward.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.1.1.
1.4.2. Pro: God commanded Abraham [to sacrifice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac) his son Isaac, and when Abraham, with a heavy heart, followed God's instructions, God knew that Abraham could be trusted to become the Patriarch of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.
1.4.2.1. Con: Because of His foreknowledge, God knew who Abraham would be and the things he would do far before giving him a test. Moreover, because of God’s middle knowledge \(knowledge of all contingencies\) He knew what Abraham would do in any set of circumstances that would be presented to him. Therefore, we can’t conclude that a test was necessary for God to understand Abraham. God already understood him.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: Unless the test was meant to give Abraham a deeper understanding of himself and of God, rather than to give God a better understanding of Abraham.
1.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: God is omnipotent, he does not need to test others in order to discern whether to reward them or not, rather he tests others to grow them themselves, in their faith, resilience and perseverance in times of trouble.
1.4.2.1.2. Con: Demonstrations can be useful tools even for an omnipotent being, as seen when God used the [Plagues of Egypt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagues_of_Egypt) to show his power.
1.4.3. Con: God is omnipotent. He should be able to decide who to reward without tests.
1.4.3.1. Con: An omnipotent God would be able to test his followers while ensuring their overall safety, instead of leaving them to the mercy of Satan.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: All creations of God exist in the context of what He has created. Therefore, even if Job's children died, their souls were still in the care of God and he may have preserved their safety in the afterlife.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: God is more focused on the spiritual well being of his followers. Through these trials He is hurting them physically, but also teaching them lessons which will help them gain entry to heaven.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.4.1.1.1.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: First you state that God Is Omnipotent. This would imply that he has full knowledge of the "test" and the end result prior to the start of the test. As such he had no reason to doubt the outcome. Therefor Job was never at the mercy of Satan but was fully protected. Second Job was permitted to be tested but could not be killed. One function of testing a persons faith is not for God to understand the degree of faith but for the person being tested to understand the depth of there faith.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Psychological torture is still harm, even if Job was guaranteed to survive it.
1.4.3.1.2.1.1. Con: This falls under the idea that everything bad that happens is harmful.  It leaves no place for that event that seems harmful that in the end turns out to be the best possible path toward safety or a better situation.
1.4.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Cauterizing a wound still means burning the wound. Just because it might be needed doesn't take away that it is still technically a burn.  Also God tested Job not for Job but for God.
1.4.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Especially since God tested Job to prove something for God. Job wasn't tested to improve Job's life
1.4.3.1.3. Con: This presupposes that a 'god' thinks and values this reality as much as humanity does. When we project our perception of reality unto God - we make the same mistake symbolically that the Angel of Light himself made in the beginning: thinking they know better than God - or to put it better - thinking that they can perceive as God does - which is impossible given our limitations.
1.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.1.1.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Job's test affected many people other than Job negatively. If God could know Job's response without causing the suffering of a large number of people that would have been the correct option.
1.4.3.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.11.
1.4.4. Con: His creations arguably have no free will under the philosophies of determinism \(if you follow a cake recipe you will always bake a cake\) and the all seeing god \(if he knows your answer before you know the choice, there is no choice\). Therefore, God knows exactly how each 'test of faith will end' meaning while they may be critical there is no reason to have them physically played out on earth.
1.4.5. Pro: Whom the persecutor decides to make use of is a common pattern of the persecuted. The prison warden of the pre-law days liked and favoured which ever prisoner did not talk back or complain. Persecutors show the most favour to those persecutee most passive and accepting of their abuser, like battered wives.
1.4.6. Con: Faith shouldn't be considered at all in order to determine if you are worthy or not.
1.4.6.1. Pro: Faith only affects yourself: the sole fact of you being faithful isn't beneficial towards the rest of the world at all.
1.4.7. Con: God was not testing Job, trying to sense his faith, as it would go against His omniscient quality. He wanted Job and Satan to learn and understand life more, in a solid concept.
1.5. Pro: A 3-O \(omniscient, omnibenevolent, omnipotent\) god has no need to test faith.
1.5.1. Pro: An omniscient God already knows how Job would react if he were to be tested.
1.5.1.1. Con: The tests God puts his followers through are not for His own benefit, but for theirs. They are to teach His followers lessons and not for His own learning.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: One possible interpretation of Job is that God used Job's suffering to reveal more about God to the world.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: Seeing as the tale paints God in a negative light this may not have been a good decision.
1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Seeing as mankind were made in God's image, showing that He is not perfect could have been to reinforce that mankind, with all their imperfections, are still His children.
1.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: If the point of the tale is that God is not perfect, then the correct interpretation is that God should not have tested Job.
1.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: God revealed himself as sovereign, not "good"
1.5.1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.5.1.2. Con: There are numerous verses in the Old Testament which indicate that humans have [free will](https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/free-will-in-the-bible/). If humans truly have free will, then God cannot know exactly what choice they will make in every situation. An omnipotent God may be capable of creating beings which he endows with freedom and over which he does not have omniscience. Therefore, a God who is typically omniscient may still not have known how Job would react if he were to be tested.
1.5.1.3. Con: God may have known the outcome, but He may have needed to demonstrate it to Satan.
1.5.1.3.1. Con: A demonstration which causes so much misery is still wrong whether it was useful or not.
1.5.1.3.1.1. Con: Job's misery is outweighed by later joy in his increased faith and understanding of God and by his restored and increased wealth.
1.5.1.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.10.1.
1.5.1.3.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.
1.5.1.3.2. Con: An omnipotent being has no need to demonstrate anything.
1.5.1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.5.5. Con: Simply seeing this a 'test' of faith might ignore more important lessons yet to be uncovered. Ex: What exactly did Job receive in the end? If one values reality around us - one might say - wealth and family. If it is the invisible - the unknown and even unknowable that is valued - That is something Job did not have at the start, and is what he earned in the end.
1.5.6. Pro: An Omnibenevolent god always does the most moral possible thing.
1.5.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.
1.5.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.11.
1.5.7. Con: God testing the faith of a follower is not for his benefit but for the benefit of the follower. This brings us to the idea that states; if you are going to test the faith then you need a test that will push the limits of that persons faith to the breaking point. Otherwise you are not testing the faith.
1.5.8. Con: Satan in this part of the Bible is not the Devil but an angel of the Lord whose sole purpose is to find mortals and test their faith, Satan informed God that Job needed to be tested and God allows it. The true issue is that if God is all knowing and all powerful then He would not need to test anyone as He would know the answer before they were even alive. Unless God was limited in power and knowledge then it is an exercise of entertainment alone and thus an evil act of torture.
1.5.8.1. Pro: The fact that God created a [position](http://bibleq.net/answer/4423/) which is based solely around testing humans despite the fact that God is omniscient and so knows the outcome to every test is proof that God engages in torture.
1.5.8.2. Con: In the old testament, [God did not know Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3&version=NIV), or that [Cain murdered Abel until he was told.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+4&version=NIV) Free will often usurps God's omniscience, hence his need to test mankind's faith and obedience to him.
1.5.9. Con: Any ''omni-'' property is a negative description. Omnibenevolence is not actually comprehended, we only describe it through what it is not. Therefore, we cannot say we actually would know what an omnibenevolent being would do.
1.5.10. Con: There is no reason to assume that the god of Job is a 3-O god.
1.5.10.1. Con: As seen in the lengthy discussion of the [Problem of Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#cite_note-10), it has been generally accepted in monotheistic religions, specifically Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, that God has the 3-O traits.
1.5.10.1.1. Con: The Problem of Evil states that a 3-o god cannot exist if evil exists. If we accept the Problem of Evil then the god of Job can not be 3-o. If the god of Job is not 3-o, then it is possible that he is not omni-benevolent, or omniscient, or omnipotent, or any combination of these.
1.5.10.1.2. Con: From a literary perspective, all descriptions of the God of Abraham come from people. People are usually considered unreliable narrators due to their ability to lie. Any individual follower may believe that their God is 3-O, but that doesn't mean that the belief is correct.
1.5.10.2. Pro: God emphasises his battle with larger cosmic beasts such as the Leviathan in his speech to Job [\(Job 41:18–21, 27\)](https://ebible.org/kjv/Job.htm). This indicates that the universe is more chaotic than Job, or we understand. Given that this beast is not fully under God's control, it is likely that God is not fully omnipotent.
1.5.10.3. Pro: In the Book of Daniel, Daniel prays and fasts for three weeks to hear from God. When an angel finally appears to him, it says that the delay was not due to a fault in Daniel or an unwillingness on the part of God to respond, but rather the result of the obstructions of a demon called "the prince of the Persian Kingdom." [\(Dan. 10:12-13\)](https://biblia.com/bible/tniv/Dan.%2010.12-13). This indicates that the God of the Old Testament is not omnipotent.
1.5.10.4. Con: Multiple [verses](https://www.allaboutgod.com/god-is-omniscient-faq.htm) in the bible indicate that God is omniscient.
1.5.10.4.1. Con: -> See 1.5.10.1.2.
1.5.11. Con: Given God has repeatedly tested people's faith \(Abraham, Job etc\), God evidently has cause to test people's faith.
1.5.11.1. Con: Historical precedent is not a justification for repeating harmful behaviours.
1.5.11.1.1. Con: If God is unchanging, then historical precedent is concrete law. Given the same set of inputs, God would constantly choose the same output.
1.5.11.1.1.1. Con: No situation ever presents the exact same inputs, thus historical precedent will never establish concrete law
1.5.11.1.1.2. Con: God does change. "Old Testament God" and "New Testament God" are often referred to as different characters in the Bible
1.5.11.1.1.2.1. Pro: The Old Testament God is seen as a God of violence [while](https://www.focusonthefamily.com/family-q-and-a/faith/the-god-of-the-old-testament-vs-the-god-of-new) the God of the New Testament is seen as the God of love.
1.5.11.1.1.2.2. Con: No, nothing in the Bible states “Old Testament God” versus “New Testament God.”
1.5.11.1.1.3. Pro: It is a common monotheistic belief that God does not change
1.5.11.1.1.3.1. Pro: The Bible backs up this belief in that it [states](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/God,-Immutability-Of) that God is unchanging multiple time.
1.5.11.1.1.4. Con: Just because something is law does not mean that it is necessarily good. God making harmful decisions consistently does not imply that those decisions are correct.
1.5.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.
1.5.11.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.
1.5.11.4. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.6. Con: It was not God who tested Job, it was Satan.
1.6.1. Con: The narrator of the Job story states that Job suffered as a result of "the trouble the [Lord](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/Job%2042.11) had brought on him." This indicates that even though Satan carried out the action which hurt Job, God is simultaneously responsible for what happened to him and indeed all human beings. Therefore, it was God, not Satan, who tested Job.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The fact that Satan is not mentioned again after the prologue indicates that God's relationship with Job, not Satan, is the focus of the story.
1.6.1.2. Con: When the Book of Job is [interpreted](http://reknew.org/2008/01/the-point-of-the-book-of-job/) in light of the ministry of Christ, God can be understood as taking responsibility for evil, death and suffering in the world, despite not being culpable for it. This serves as an illustration, not a contradiction, of God's loving and benign character.
1.6.2. Pro: In the Book of Job, God is depicted in a manner similar to ancient [Near Eastern monarch](http://reknew.org/2008/01/the-point-of-the-book-of-job/)s and this is how the God's authority may have been understood by contemporary followers. As such, while God may not have have been strictly responsible for the actions of Satan, he may have assumed responsibility \([Job 42:11](https://biblia.com/bible/niv/Job%2042.11)\) for the actions of his agent. This indicates that God may not have been truly responsible for all the ills faced by Job.
1.6.3. Pro: While God did enter into the wager with Satan, He did not plan or cause the afflictions which hurt Job. Moreover, the prologue goes out of its way to emphasise the haphazard way in which Job's test occurred - Satan merely happens upon a meeting with God \(Job 1:7\). This does not seem like it was part of God's grand plan for the world.
1.6.3.1. Con: God [initiates](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Job%201%E2%80%932) the bet with Satan and so demonstrates a callous attitude to human life.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: God made the Israelites roam the desert for [40 years](https://www.gotquestions.org/wilderness-wandering.html) due to the actions of ten Israelites, which shows a distinct lack of care for His people.
1.6.3.1.1.1. Con: Absolutely false. To say that God punishes people because he is cold hearted is as arrogant as saying policemen do their job because they’re full of hate
1.6.3.2. Con: The whole idea of a grand plan with a 3 - O deity is that nothing is outside the boarders of their grand plan. Meaning the testing and by extension their suffering was intentional at worse or allowed at best.
1.6.4. Pro: In God's final speech to Job wherein He refutes Job's theology, God never acknowledges that he was the one behind Job’s suffering. Rather, he appeals to factors in creation to explain why Job cannot understand his suffering.
1.6.4.1. Pro: The fact that God attacks Job's theology at all - which at numerous points asserts that God is totally responsible for his ills eg. \([Job 24:12](https://biblia.com/bible/tniv/Job%2024.12)\), indicates that this is not an accurate understanding of God's role in the creation of suffering.
1.6.5. Con: Everything in the universe was created by God, according to christian theology, therefore he is ultimately responsible for all of it, every last ant, every crime, every torture. Regardless, he "allowed" Satan to "take away jobs wealth". God in this instance as in others is a vain praise seeking, psychopath.
1.6.6. Con: God, and by extension faith in him, is advertised many times in the Bible as the shield with which the devil may be repelled. On this occasion when God choses not to protect Job he is going back on that idea. Choosing not to protect someone when you can prevent harm is the same as dooming them to suffer yourself
1.6.7. Con: God is all knowing, God knew of Job and this event before darkness and light were separated. Since God is the beginning of all things, that would include all things evil as well as good. God is the one who allows Satan to have power, and Satan tortures Job for no reason
1.6.8. Pro: As the observer, God did not do anything. The ruler of the realm, Satan, did as he pleased and this served the higher purpose. Not because of the physical and familial rewards Job received in the end, but because of the knowledge he came away with just prior to humbling himself while God spoke to him. That there are unknowables, great and wondrous things of which we have no idea. All of which are a conversation away when you speak to God as he did \(according to the story\).
1.6.9. Pro: God didn't test Job. He never questioned Job's character and at all times affirmed Job's righteousness. He never initiated nor requested Job's sufferings. The worst that God said about Job was, at the end, that he didn't know -- which in terms of the narrative was literally true. The issue at stake was not Job's faith in God, but God's faith in Job: God's affirmation of Job's righteousness meant that Job's failure would then be God's as well. But, God wasn't worried.
1.6.10. Con: God allowed Satan to test Job. If anything, Satan tested God and God succumbed to his own pride.
1.6.10.1. Con: This would assume that the Author of the Book of Job wanted to imply God has pride. Since pride is condemned elsewhere in scripture the suggestion that God succumbed to pride raises an irreconcilable contradiction, if Job is scripture, and most people would say it is. The contradiction would be irreconcilable, especially if it is thought that God is ultimately the author of scripture. That would make God hypocritical. That would never do.
1.6.11. Con: If you agree or don't interfere in what you see, than you are an accomplice of an event at a certain extent. So technically both did.
1.6.11.1. Con: Only if it is a true story. One has to ask the question, "How is it that Satan has freedom of movement in the court of heaven, and can converse equally with God, in this story." Compare [Gen.3:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.3%3A14-15&version=NRSV). Likely the book is an explanation of human suffering under divine governance. Not a record of historical events.
1.6.12. Pro: God couldn't do anything to stop Satan, as Job sinned \(verse 5, overly sacrificing on behalf of his sons, based on fear and anxiety\), allowing Satan, on the basis of God's permissive will, to test Job.
1.7. Con: Viewing Job’s hardship as a “test” is a fundamental error. There is no indication in the entire book that Job’s trials were a test of his character. Rather, God allows the Satan to harm Job. This is similar to God permitting evil in the world. Thus the book is really about the problem of evil in the world and a good God allowing it to exist, and using the word “test” is an error.
1.7.1. Pro: The book of Job is meant provide a satisfactory answer for why God would permit evil and suffering in the world. The answer given is that we are as dust and our perspective is too limited to judge why God would concur with evil acts in the world. In other words, we as free creatures are not omniscient and our inability to see all ends makes any attempt to call God to “justice” is unwarranted for we do not have the necessary knowledge to do so.
1.7.2. Con: It's Elohim who attacks, kills, harms Job. Elohim befriended Satan and was very impressed with his intelligence. So the Elohim brought Satan to debate God. They didn't agree with or defend God, and then went on to test how much the locals really believed the Word of God. If Elohim who serves God killed all of Jobs Family, will Job blame the Master of the Elohim, or will Job supernaturally blame Satan whom the Elohim truly serves for all the chapters & pages of this Book? [Names of God Bible, Job1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1&version=NOG)
1.8. Con: It is possible that the book of Job is not to be taken literally. It could be a metaphorical story that is meant to instruct and teach wisdom.
1.8.1. Pro: The book of Job challenged a fundamental assumption of the era in which it was written, namely that God blesses those who obey Him and curses those who don’t. We know from our own experiences this is often false. Thus the book was a challenge to this idea and a broader call to trust in God in spite of our circumstances because our perspective is limited.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.9. Con: God made the wager as a demonstration to Satan in order to influence them, and either redeem Satan by showing them the positive example of Job, or by showing the futility of attempting to oppose God.
1.9.1. Pro: The Satan from the Bible has the desire and the power to cause huge suffering to human beings. Steering Satan away from this agenda would accomplish untold good for all time.
1.10. Con: God should not have tested anyone. Testing is a human attribute born of cynicism. It amounts only to mischief and caprice.
1.11. Pro: God should not intentionally torture his followers to make a point.
1.11.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.2.1.
1.11.2. Pro: Through his actions God is hypocritical and acts in ways He has forbade.
1.11.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.
1.11.2.2. Pro: God tells his followers to ["resist the Devil"](https://www.biblestudytools.com/james/4-7.html), which makes his dealings with the Devil more dubious.
1.11.2.2.1. Con: God is likely [omniscient](https://www.allaboutgod.com/god-is-omniscient-faq.htm) and [omnipotent](https://www.allaboutgod.com/omnipotent-god.htm) or at the very least far wiser and powerful than human beings. As a result, He may be capable of dealing with the Devil in a way that His followers are not. Therefore, both his advice to his followers and his dealings with the devil are justifiable.
1.11.2.2.1.1. Con: "Do as I say and not as I do" is not a terribly strong argument.
1.11.2.3. Pro: He [states](http://biblehub.com/nasb/exodus/22-21.htm) "You shall not wrong a stranger" yet gives Satan permission to harm Job for a bet.
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.2.
1.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.
1.11.5. Con: Everything that God's followers have are a gift and ultimately belong to God. Therefore God has a right to whatever He wants with them. This does not equate to torture.
1.11.5.1. Pro: The concept of Job's children and livestock being taken from him being the same as torture implies that he had a right to them and negates the fact they are simply luxuries God granted him.
1.11.5.2. Pro: Job himself emphasised this point when he stated "Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will depart. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away". This quote shows that he understands that everything he had has always belonged to God and so it is up to God to decide their faith.
1.11.5.3. Con: Implying God's ownership over all his followers reduces the value of Job's children to no more than a possession. Therefore, contradicting the concept we are all equally valuable in God's eyes.
1.11.5.4. Con: If all the blessings of his followers truely are gifts, God has no power to reclaim them. A gift freely given is the property of the receiver, for good or evil. To remove or reclaim it is theft. Theft, even with omnibenevolent intent is still a crime as set out in the ten commandments.
1.11.6. Pro: Through causing the pain of his followers God contradicts the claims that He is a loving and merciful God.
1.11.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.2.
1.11.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.1.
1.11.6.3. Con: The story appears to contradict, as you state. God does not. There is still plenty of deep teaching to take away from this story. Ex: The story is not about the increased wealth that Job receives in the end. He already had that. What he didn't have was the knowledge that he gained in the end, which came directly from God. Had he not experienced something like this he may never have received that.
1.11.6.4. Con: Job spoke [against](http://www.biblebro.net/book-of-job-god-did-not-give-satan-power/) God many times and yet God allowed him time to learn the lesson He was teaching. This demonstrates a kind nature despite His harsh teaching method.
1.11.7. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.1.
1.11.8. Con: It wasn't just to make a point. He wasn't trying to 'own' satan, he was testing Job. The purpose of the test was twofold; he was partially doing it to prove a point, but he was primarily doing it to make sure that Job's faith wasn't dependent on what it would earn him. I also believe it was done to demonstrate to people in the future how we should act in the face of adversity. Lastly, I think that it was justified because it was a net positive, for Job and for the world.
1.11.8.1. Con: God is supposed  to be omnipotent, so he could have accomplished this net good without killing Job's children or torturing him.
1.11.9. Con: -> See 1.6.
1.11.10. Con: Though I get what you mean, there is a possibility that life and pain don't mean the same to God as it means to us, especially since He mended it in the end.
1.11.11. Pro: God was complicit and enabling with known hatred, and wilfully allowed harm to a innocent.  That's not good leadership.
1.11.11.1. Con: I doubt it was the author's intention that we should draw this conclusion. If the author is God, then he would be questioning His own morality. If not, then the author still questions God's morality in a book about God's dealings with mankind.
1.12. Pro: God should not make deals with Satan.
1.12.1. Pro: If God makes deals with Satan, humans reading the story will be willing to make deals with Satan.
1.12.1.1. Con: A central [message](http://www.lcg.org/cgi-bin/lcg/studytopics/lcg-st.cgi?category=Christianity1&item=1122911276) of the Book of Job is that God and his actions are beyond the comprehension of mankind. If followers understand this message, they will know that even if God saw fit to make deals with Satan, it is still wrong for them to do so.
1.12.1.1.1. Con: God does not want to be unknowable. It is Adam and Eve and those ashamed of their true nature that hide from and proclaim God is a Mystery. Those who believe in God know reality is plan and simple. All that is written, even if it is a lie, is knowable by the Autobiography of each man or woman in society. ~ The camera work of "History Books" jump around avoiding the "Fountain Heads" like a Schizophrenic bee hoping no one person's story escapes a false chain of age 20s make a joyful noise singers.
1.12.1.2. Pro: [Bob Dylan \(Conversation with the Devil\)](https://youtu.be/rU5K6wbyU7Q), and many famous people have mentioned this. The new Generation talks about supernatural forces rather than Lucifer or the Devil which were popular lyrics from the 1940s through to the 1980s in country music.
1.12.2. Pro: Satan, being rational and malevolent, would only make a deal if it allowed him to carry out his agenda of causing harm and pain. So God is carrying out Satan's will.
1.12.2.1. Con: Just because Satan is rational does not mean that he makes deals that are only in his interest, especially if the being he is making a deal with is infinitely wise and powerful. The fact that Satan ends up being wrong as to the outcome of the wager indicates that Satan did not get the better of the deal.
1.12.2.2. Con: Satan's internal malevolence may have meant that he could not see Job's true piety. This may cloud his judgement and lead him to make a deal which furthers the will of God, not Satan.
1.12.2.3. Pro: The result of Satan's wager with God include the death of animals, servants and children, not to mention the immense suffering of Job himself. If Satan's goal was to introduce as much suffering and death as possible into the world, his wager with God achieved that, despite the fact he did not technically win the bet.
1.12.2.4. Pro: Satan did not stop being evil, or do anything for God or humanity, as a result of losing the wager. So Satan essentially tricked God into testing an innocent man for nothing.
1.12.2.4.1. Pro: Satan never staked anything on the outcome of the wager, so God had nothing to gain from the wager except the wager in and of itself.
1.12.2.5. Con: This assumes Satan is on the same level as God.
1.12.2.5.1. Pro: Satan may not share God's powers, such as omniscience, giving God a greater understanding of the possible outcomes, and putting God in a better position to predict what will happen.
1.12.3. Con: This presupposes that God is limited by Time and Space and cause and effect, which is by definition something that would not be a god. Satan being a creation - is not a god and is subject to God. Satan as the ruler of the realm of reality \(per the same book this story is in\) has full sway and authority to do as he wishes - yes as God watches. The story and what is taken from it says more about the reader than about God or Satan.
1.12.4. Con: God is more powerful than Satan and could destroy him if he wanted, so Satan's very existence must serve God's purpose.
1.12.4.1. Con: I don't believe personally that God would hate Satan, he just doesn't agree with him, and so, killing something just because you don't agree with it seems more like the work of a tyrant than with our current idea of what a God would be like.
1.12.4.2. Con: There is no reason to believe that God's purpose in this instance is beneficial to mankind.
1.12.4.2.1. Pro: God's purposes in His bet with Satan could easily be for His own personal benefit and not the benefit of mankind seeing as it caused misery for a multitude of His followers.
1.12.4.2.1.1. Con: Given that God is an incorporeal being whose main purpose in religious texts is to guide mankind, it is unclear what possible personal benefit he could derive from testing Job.
1.12.4.2.1.1.1. Con: God is portrayed as prideful. Testing Job adds to his pride which would be a personal benefit.
1.12.4.2.1.2. Pro: When reading the interaction between Satan and God it could be construed that the point of the bet was to satisfy God's prideful nature, not benefit mankind.
1.12.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: The bet comes about when God brings Job to Satan's attention and brags of his loyalty.
1.12.4.2.2. Pro: Giving Satan permission to torture, even one person, on earth cannot be beneficial to mankind.
1.12.4.2.3. Con: God as the creator of man is automatically aiding mankind as He directs the trajectory of their existence.
1.12.4.2.3.1. Con: Directing mankind's trajectory is not necessarily benevolent or beneficial.
1.12.5. Con: God is omniscient and knows the outcome of all things, so making a deal with Satan can never work against God's own will.
1.12.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.
1.12.5.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.
1.12.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.1.3.1.2.2.1.
1.12.6. Con: God did not ‘make a deal’ with the satan in the story. He responded to the satan’s critique.
1.12.7. Con: Satan is not a proper noun. Satan is not an individual being. Rather, satan is a descriptive noun that we have transliterated and given a personal backstory in English/western culture. Translating ‘the satan’ \(as it is always written with ‘the’ in Job\), it means ‘the opposer’. The opposer critiques God’s policy of rewarding Job for being faithful, suggesting that God does not truly know whether Job is really faithful.
1.12.8. Con: -> See 1.1.11.
1.12.9. Pro: Satan is a being of evil and so through making deals with him God is setting a bad example for His followers.
1.12.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.11.2.2.
1.12.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.12.9.3. Con: The Elohim=Middle Class, set the Bad Example. God is Out-Numbered. It's a strange Trinity Narrative = Yahweh, Elohim, Satan. ~ Stolen by a previous Pope in 1099 AD from #AleppoCodex, re-authored and returned about 120years later in the 1200's AD. Men also edited the #SinaiCodex, it literally has WhiteOut on a page = signifying changes. Plus Catholic #NovaVulgata 1985 a new Primary Text for all. Where are the official Latin dictionary to keep Bishops in agreement on what THEE NewVulgate tells us?
1.12.9.4. Con: Per our Fraternal Order of Police \(FOP\), Satan commits no evil for the entire Bible. ~ The police would not arrest Satan if alive for any thing Satan #SAID in all 51 First Testament & 27 Help Matthew Kill Jesus Books. ~ I tried to have "Walter Fish" who said he would see my home arsoned arrested after arson happened, police said even though He said it in court, the court record was not a word-by-word transcript. ~ Like Job's suffering, in USA #Arson is Not Punishable even if in Court Proclaimed.
