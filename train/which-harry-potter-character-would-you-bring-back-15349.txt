Discussion Title: Which Harry Potter character would you bring back?

1. Which Harry Potter character would you bring back?
1.1. James Potter
1.1.1. Pro: Harry never met his parents
1.1.2. Con: He was a bully and wouldn't even be famous if it wasn't for his death.
1.2. Aragog the spider
1.2.1. Con: He was a spider
1.2.1.1. Pro: Big pincers. *Insert Daniel Radcliffe doing his pincer motion*
1.2.1.2. Pro: Spiders are feared by many people.
1.2.2. Con: The only person who'd care much would be Hagrid; nobody else was very fond.
1.2.3. Pro: Many consider spiders to be cool, meaning bringing back Aragog is a positive idea.
1.2.4. Pro: Hagrid would probably be very happy to have Aragog back.
1.2.5. Pro: He has a very large family which presumably would like to see him again
1.2.5.1. Con: His family were all for eating Harry and Ron. Who is to say that they would not eat their dead family member? Depending on the type of spider that they are, this is completely possible, as some spiders eat those of the same kind as them, and some eat those that they are 'related' to.
1.2.5.2. Pro: It would provide the spiders an opportunity to mourn/eat Aragog according to their culture.
1.3. Hedwig
1.3.1. Pro: Hedwig's death was very sudden and unexpected; it would be nice to get proper closure over her death.
1.3.2. Con: She was a pet rather than a major character; there are more worthy people to bring back than Hedwig.
1.4. Lily Potter
1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.4.2. Pro: She was, by all accounts, a very loving woman who would have been a wonderful mother.
1.4.3. Con: Bringing Lily Potter back to life would devalue the power of her sacrifice.
1.5. Dobby
1.5.1. Pro: Dobby was a beloved character since the second book, somebody who loved Harry uninhibitedly and the reader grew very fond of.
1.5.2. Con: Dobby tried to maim/ seriously injure Harry.
1.5.2.1. Con: He was doing this in a caring way and the readers saw that.
1.6. Remus Lupin
1.6.1. Pro: Many people's favourite character: a fantastic teacher and support, encouraged Harry to reach his full potential, and despite being ostracised by much of wizarding society he remained a good person with solid morals.
1.6.2. Con: His behaviour towards Tonks in the seventh book is appalling.
1.6.2.1. Con: He could make up for his poor behavior.
1.6.3. Pro: He has a son to raise.
1.6.4. Con: He might be as neglectful of his son as he was of Tonks.
1.6.5. Con: He is a werewolf; while this can be controlled and managed as a condition, it does still mean he is \(to a degree\) dangerous.
1.7. Professor Severus Snape
1.7.1. Pro: He was a misunderstood man who was bullied throughout school and just wanted to be with the girl of his dreams, who married the kid who bullied him.
1.7.2. Con: He was two-faced and people never trusted him
1.7.2.1. Con: They didn't trust him because the Potters were killed and James hadn't liked him.
1.7.2.2. Con: Albus Dumbledore trusted him and to some that would have been enough.
1.8. Professor Albus Dumbledore
1.8.1. Pro: He was the greatest wizard of his Age.
1.8.2. Pro: Dumbledore's got style!
1.8.3. Con: He was detrimentally secretive.
1.8.4. Pro: He is the only known gay man in the wizarding world.
1.8.4.1. Con: This never manifested in the books.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: Many have criticised J.K. Rowling's intentions in stating, after the fact, that Dumbledore was homosexual.
1.8.5. Con: Dumbledore had accepted his own death, and it would be an insult to him to drag him back to life.
1.9. Fred Weasley
1.9.1. Pro: [George could stop crying whenever he looks in the mirror.](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/George_Weasley)
1.9.2. Con: There are too many Weasleys as it is.
1.9.2.1. Con: 1. Calm down Aunt Muriel! 2. You can never have too many Weasleys.
1.9.3. Pro: It was so heartbreaking to see Fred dying because he and George have never been apart in their entire life\(except once\) and because of this untimely death of Fred, George must have been traumatized.
1.9.4. Pro: Without Fred, George is lost and does not want to do any of the stuff he used to. Without Fred, the Weasleys are broken.
1.10. Tonks
1.10.1. Pro: She has a child to raise.
1.10.2. Pro: Teddy should get to meet his parents.
1.11. Sirius Black
1.11.1. Pro: He was the first parental figure to feature heavily in Harry's life.
1.11.2. Pro: He was a misunderstood man who just wanted the best for his godson.
