Discussion Title: Cruel and Unusual: Should Capital Punishment Hurt?

1. Executions should be painful.
1.1. Pro: Pain could be used to differentiate the application of the death penalty depending on the crime committed. Currently, different offenses warrant the death penalty, yet all criminals sentenced to death receive virtually the same punishment.
1.2. Pro: Painful executions will be a more effective punishment of the offender.
1.2.1. Pro: A punishment is [by definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment) an imposition of an undesirable or unpleasant outcome and nothing is more undesirable and unpleasant than a painful death. Thus a painful execution would be the most effective form of punishment.
1.2.1.1. Con: Just because a punishment is defined as an undesirable or unpleasant outcome does not mean that the most effective punishment is the most extreme undesirable or unpleasant outcome.
1.2.2. Con: There is nothing to suggest they are a more effective punishment. Dead is dead, after all. They might be a more effective deterrent to other potential criminals, but the level of pain will have no effect on the offender at the end of the day as they will be dead regardless.
1.2.2.1. Con: This assumes that all possible methods of execution are seen as equivalent, since they all result in the same irreversible outcome. That is not the case. Common sense would suggest that, if given the choice, someone would choose a painless, quick execution over a painful, prolonged one.
1.2.3. Con: Capital punishment prevents the executed person from doing greater harm. Inflicting additional harm on them does not change that basic equation and is therefore unwarranted.
1.2.3.1. Pro: The point of capital "punishment"  is not to "punish" the convict, but to vindicate the victim \(or victims\), and to demonstrate the community's intolerance of and abhorrence for the crime. The convict need only be killed - whether or not the convict suffers pain in the process of being killed doesn't matter. So if the convict need not suffer pain, then the killing need not be painful.
1.2.3.2. Pro: Inflicting pain does not solve the social causes of crime \(such as poverty, deviancy or drug use etc.\) and is no guarantee to deter criminally minded individuals. The act of hurting in capital punishments serve no purpose other than additional unneeded retribution against the sentenced criminal. An individual who has been sentenced to death has already lost everything: needing to inflict additional suffering during execution is a childish an immature notion.
1.2.3.3. Con: There must be a way to assign value to things. In the penal system, inflicting "additional harm" is already used to explicitly distinguish between sentences. For example, solitary confinement is reserved for convicts who, having already been incarcerated for a specific crime, are deemed deserving of extra disciplining. When it comes to capital punishment, making some executions more painful than others could be a way to distinguish between criminals who have already received a death sentence.
1.2.3.4. Pro: Maximizing the executed person's experience of pain or violence is a wasted effort as that person cannot possibly react to this experience in any meaningful way. After all, he/she is dead.
1.2.3.5. Con: Painful executions would be easier and cheaper.
1.2.3.5.1. Con: There is no cost not worthy of taking care for the well-being of citizens, depraved or not, even with respect for capital punishment as a government should be responsible for the well-being of all its citizens.
1.2.3.5.2. Con: Inflicting pain onto others is psychologically straining, so it would be harder for people involved in the execution.
1.2.3.5.3. Con: They wouldn't be easier for the person being executed.
1.2.3.5.4. Pro: Executions should be administered as effectively as possible, independent of the form they take. If that involves pain, where pain isn't the end goal of the act of punishment, that doesn't seem to be unacceptable.
1.2.3.5.5. Pro: [Hanging, shooting and electrocution are cheaper](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/whats-the-cheapest-way-to-execute-evildoers) than using lethal injections, which are perceived as the most humane way of administering capital punishment.
1.2.3.5.5.1. Con: While methods like hanging and shooting might be cheaper, they are not suitable for painful executions as they usually cause less suffering than the currently most popular method, lethal injections.
1.2.3.5.5.1.1. Con: Lethal injections involve the use of anaesthetics, so they are more likely to be painless than shooting and hanging.
1.2.3.5.5.1.2. Pro: The firing squad [has been described](http://time.com/3831515/execution-lethal-injection-supreme-court/) as providing a quicker, [largely pain-free](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-firing-squad-more-humane-than-lethal-injection/) and more certain death - and therefore as being more humane - than other methods.
1.2.3.5.5.1.3. Pro: Hanging has been [described](http://www.ktre.com/story/5962024/execution-by-hanging-still-happens-in-the-us-but-is-it-humane) as a quick and painless death, assuming it is done correctly.
1.2.3.5.5.1.3.1. Con: If done right it breaks the neck and is indeed quick and relatively painless. However it is almost impossible to guarantee. The alternative then becomes a slow choke and asphyxiation, which is far from quick or painless.
1.2.3.5.6. Pro: Due to the unavailability of the lethal drugs a [number of states](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-lethal-injection) \(e.g. Louisiana, Ohio\) postponed executions.
1.2.3.5.6.1. Pro: In 2016, [Pfizer joined over 20 American and European pharmaceutical manufacturers](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/14/us/pfizer-execution-drugs-lethal-injection.html?_r=0) that had previously blocked the sale of their drugs for use in lethal injections, effectively closing the open market for FDA-approved manufacturers for any potential lethal execution drug.
1.2.3.5.7. Pro: Supply problems forced states to switch to more painful methods that are more easily available than lethal drugs.
1.2.3.5.7.1. Pro: [In Tennessee](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-lethal-injection), lethal injection was replaced by the electric chair and in Utah, the firing squad can be used if the state cannot obtain the drugs for lethal injection 30 days before an execution.
1.2.3.5.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.5.6.1.
1.2.3.5.8. Con: Painful methods would need to be regulated, too, to inflict pain homogeneously. This will require regulations and cause costs in itself.
1.2.3.5.8.1. Pro: The perception of pain is subjective and can vary, hence it would be difficult to enforce a consistent and identical punishment in all cases.
1.2.3.5.8.1.1. Con: As long as society perceives the application of a punishment as consistent and identical between recipients, it does not matter whether these recipients actually perceive this punishment in different ways.
1.2.3.5.8.1.1.1. Pro: Punishments adjusted to personal experience would be perceived by some as unfair. Those who claim to be extra-sensitive would be seen to be given undue leniency, that would lead to resentment and extra conflict.
1.2.3.5.8.1.2. Con: While there are different [thresholds of pain](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/01/finding-a-language-for-pain/512615/), extreme practices will cause a lot of pain to anyone.
1.2.3.5.8.1.2.1. Pro: Any difference in the perception of pain could be accommodated by gradually increasing the amount of pain caused. Thus even despite subjective differences in the perception of pain, pain can be used consistently as a form of punishment.
1.2.3.5.8.1.3. Pro: [Factors](http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/05/health/la-he-pain-differences-20100705) such as age, gender and ethnicity can affect how people experience pain.
1.2.3.5.8.1.4. Pro: An inability to provide consistent punishment would violate the idea of "equality before the law," which is [enshrined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_before_the_law) in most national constitutions and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
1.2.3.5.8.1.4.1. Con: Other punishments dealt out by the judiciary are usually not expected to be absolutely consistent and identical.
1.2.3.5.8.1.4.1.1. Con: Even if completely consistent standards are unachievable, they should be pursued whenever possible. The fact that pain is a more subjective punishment than others should be a reason for caution.
1.2.3.5.8.1.4.1.2. Pro: Differentiation of punishments would harm predictability of criminal sanctions.
1.2.3.5.8.1.4.1.3. Pro: Two people sentenced to equal terms in prison can have two very different experiences in prison, and thus very different experiences of punishment.
1.2.3.5.8.1.5. Con: -> See 1.2.3.5.8.1.4.1.
1.2.3.5.9. Con: The most costly part of executions is not the act itself but the [legal proceedings](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty). Reducing the costs for executions is marginal.
1.2.3.5.9.1. Con: This claim is irrelevant, since the legal proceedings costs would not change based on the method of execution and are thus out of scope. Decreasing the cost of the actual execution act is what is in scope here; thus, no matter how marginal that cost improvement might be, that is what the discussion should focus on. This is based on the economic principle or [relevant vs. irrelevant costs](https://www.dummies.com/business/accounting/relevant-versus-irrelevant-costs/).
1.2.3.5.10. Con: Painful, on the surface, does not mean cheap. If we were to follow this argument to its natural conclusion, we would end with the cheapest form of execution, not the most painful, and the two are very different.
1.2.4. Con: The punishment inflicted on a convict should be proportionate to the crime committed; a larger punishment is not automatically better or more appropriate.
1.2.4.1. Con: Following this logic, the more heinous the crime, the larger the punishment. Making an execution painful would thus allow for proportionate retribution.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: This would require deciding how much a victim suffered to make the punishment proportionate. There are few reliable methods for determining this.
1.2.4.1.1.1. Con: The legal system already determines the gravity of crimes \(and, by consequence, the appropriate punishment for the offender\) on behalf of the victim.
1.2.4.1.2. Con: How would retribution be "proportionate" in the case of a mass-murderer or serial killer? No matter hoe painful you make it, you can only kill them once.
1.2.5. Pro: If the purpose of executions is to demonstrate the power of the state, then a painful death penalty does so better than a painless death penalty.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Painful retribution is an integral part of the state's self-assertion towards its citizens.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Painful punishment was an important part of retributive justice from the very beginning of human civilization. Examples include the "an eye for an eye" rule, lashes, etc.
1.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Modern democracies' legal systems have evolved far beyond painful execution techniques such as being quartered, boiled alive, the Catherine Wheel, etc. Wishing to not only kill, but having pain and torture as part of the retributive process is medieval.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: The US has no long-standing practice of executing in an intentionally cruel manner and repeatedly phased out execution methods that were deemed inhumane.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Electrocution was specifically adopted with the belief and intention that it would be [more humane and less painful](http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/chair.html).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Lethal injections are [intended to be pain-free](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/capital-punishment-by-lethal-injection/).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.5.5.1.3.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.4. Pro: The use of the gas chamber was introduced based on the belief that it would be a [more humane](http://deathpenaltycurriculum.org/student/c/about/methods/gaschamber.htm) method of execution.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.5.5.1.2.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.6. Con: [88%](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution) of all executions in the United States since 1976 were conducted via lethal injections. It remains the [primary method](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/lethal-injection?did=1686&scid=64) in all American states and for the federal government. This shows that America has de-facto a long-standing practice of executing in an avoidably painful manner.
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.6.1. Pro: The [most common](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/views-executions?exec_name_1=&exec_year%5B%5D=1977&exec_year%5B%5D=1979&exec_year%5B%5D=1981&exec_year%5B%5D=1982&exec_year%5B%5D=1983&exec_year%5B%5D=1984&exec_year%5B%5D=1985&exec_year%5B%5D=1986&exec_year%5B%5D=1987&exec_year%5B%5D=1988&exec_year%5B%5D=1989&exec_year%5B%5D=1990&exec_year%5B%5D=1991&exec_year%5B%5D=1992&exec_year%5B%5D=1993&exec_year%5B%5D=1994&exec_year%5B%5D=1995&exec_year%5B%5D=1996&exec_year%5B%5D=1997&exec_year%5B%5D=1998&exec_year%5B%5D=1999&exec_year%5B%5D=2000&exec_year%5B%5D=2001&exec_year%5B%5D=2002&exec_year%5B%5D=2003&exec_year%5B%5D=2004&exec_year%5B%5D=2005&exec_year%5B%5D=2006&exec_year%5B%5D=2007&exec_year%5B%5D=2008&exec_year%5B%5D=2009&exec_year%5B%5D=2010&exec_year%5B%5D=2011&exec_year%5B%5D=2012&exec_year%5B%5D=2013&exec_year%5B%5D=2014&exec_year%5B%5D=2015&exec_year%5B%5D=2016&exec_year%5B%5D=2017&sex=All&sex_1=All&method%5B%5D=Lethal+Injection&federal=All&foreigner=All&juvenile=All&volunteer=All) execution method in the US - lethal injection - [is far from painless](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7269-execution-by-injection-far-from-painless/).
1.2.5.1.1.1.1.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.2.
1.2.5.1.2. Con: Just because retribution has been the basis for the state's self-assertion towards its citizens does not mean it should continue to do so. If it is not a positive value, society should abandon it.
1.2.5.1.3. Con: Modern [governmentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governmentality) is based on inducing desired behavior by non-violent means. Pain is not practiced by societies as punishment elsewhere and can even be counterproductive.
1.2.6. Pro: In order to accomplish retributive justice, it is only fair to cruelly execute an offender who caused suffering to others by committing a cruel crime.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts, paradigmatically serious crimes, morally [deserve to suffer](http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/justice-retributive/) a proportionate punishment.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: The possibility for suffering is astronomical. By this logic of inflicting the worst possible misery as true punishment would mean grievous offenders should be kept alive as long as possible while flayed.
1.2.6.1.2. Con: It is however [morally impermissible](http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/justice-retributive/) intentionally to inflict disproportionately large punishments on wrongdoers. Inflicting enormous pain would thus be dispropotionate.
1.2.6.1.2.1. Con: This assumes the crime committed did not involve inflicting enormous pain on the victim, which it likely did if the punishment for the crime is the death penalty.
1.2.6.1.2.1.1. Con: Various US states administer the death penalty for crimes that do not necessarily involve pain or cruelty. Arkansas and Colorado, for example, for treason; Georgia and Mississippi for aircraft piracy \([U.S. Department of Justice, p. 6](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cp13st.pdf)\).
1.2.6.1.3. Con: There are many people that commit wrongful acts out of unfortunate circumstances. It seems morally unfair to punish them harshly without taking into consideration their situation.
1.2.6.1.3.1. Pro: It [has been](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/2200) argued that most crimes are the product of emotion and passion - and that logical considerations about the possible punishment \(painful as it may be\) do not feature in the underlying considerations.
1.2.6.1.3.1.1. Pro: This is particularly true for the kind of crimes that attract the death penalty. Murder and the like are commonly motivated by particularly strong emotions.
1.2.6.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Murders are often planned, and so there is lots of time for perpetrators to realise and consider the consequences.
1.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Getting away with murder is hard, because of the likelihood of leaving evidence and the resources the state commits to finding perpetrators. As a result, lots of murderers carefully plan the crime.
1.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Society ingrains a deep respect for human life, which means those committing murder have a large internal obstacle to first overcome. Overcoming this means that those committing murder spend more time thinking about the crime before committing it.
1.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: While murders might be planned, that does not mean that strong emotions are not ruling perpetrators' decisions during that time.
1.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.4. Pro: An Australian study on arson found evidence of advance planning in [43.9%](http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/481-500/tandi484.html) of their control group homicides.
1.2.6.1.3.1.1.1.4.1. Con: The number cited in the study is based on a relatively small sample of 123 murders; for 12% of these, no information about whether the act was planned was available.
1.2.6.1.3.1.2. Con: If the punishment is sufficiently visually and publicly cruel, it will enter the public consciousness and be sufficiently present in the minds of even those who have otherwise lost control.
1.2.6.1.3.1.2.1. Con: Torturous punishment sets a bad precedent that could lead to future violence directed at good people under a less kind/rational regime.
1.2.6.1.3.1.3. Pro: Taking a human life is so abhorred by society that those committing it must either have total disregard for society, or be driven by something even stronger. This is likely to be the passions of the moment, and ones that are so strong that they are not deterred by all the existing consequences of murder.
1.2.6.1.3.1.4. Con: Not all crimes are the products of passion, so deterrence would still apply to those crimes that are pre-meditated.
1.2.6.1.3.2. Pro: [About a third](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16449701) of those convicted of homicide suffered from some form of mental disorder; most of them did not attend psychiatric services. Mental disorders and homicide [correlate](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1516-44462006000600003&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en).
1.2.6.1.3.3. Pro: Black Americans are six times as likely to be murdered as are white Americans. This creates an environment that can impose a preemptive motive for murder: "People sometimes kill simply to avoid being killed" \([O'Flaherty/Sethi, p. 1](http://www.columbia.edu/~rs328/Homicide.pdf)\).
1.2.6.1.3.3.1. Con: Where there is an actual threat of death, this would be self-defence.
1.2.6.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Preemptive killings in a [climate of fear](http://www.columbia.edu/~rs328/Homicide.pdf) and violence usually do not qualify as self-defense yet are charged as murder.
1.2.6.1.3.4. Con: These would be mitigating factors - or may even be such that the person is not convicted of first degree murder, and so is not eligible for the death penalty in the first place.
1.2.6.1.4. Con: That one "deserves to suffer" does not entail that people or states have the moral right to sanction the administration of suffering.
1.2.6.2. Con: Crimes that are punished with the death penalty do not necessarily involve pain or cruelty. Murder, for example, can take place without either of the two.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: The US federal Code of Law contains [several offenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_the_United_States_federal_government#Capital_offenses) that are punishable with the death penalty yet do not necessarily involve pain or cruelty, for example espionage and treason.
1.2.6.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.2.1.1.
1.2.6.3. Con: This assumes a [retributive](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-retributive/) theory of justice. But this is not a theory that should be adopted by the modern state.
1.2.6.3.1. Pro: Society is no better than a criminal if it tortures.
1.2.6.3.1.1. Con: The states' actions are, in fact, of a different kind than those of criminals, as they have legitimacy.
1.2.6.3.1.1.1. Con: States' actions hold no merit of being legitimate simply for being states' actions.
1.2.6.3.1.1.2. Con: Crimes against humanity have been many times suported on State's actions. We should think twice and act alway kindly with others.
1.2.6.3.1.1.3. Pro: State's actions - including legal painful executions - are democratically-endorsed, and part of a regulated and scrutinised judicial system.
1.2.6.3.1.2. Con: Society inflicts pain according to law and due process. This makes it different from the criminal, who breaks laws to inflict pain.
1.2.6.3.1.2.1. Pro: The members of society have agreed to accept and honor these laws in exchange for the protection of their rights as part of the social contract.
1.2.6.3.1.2.1.1. Con: By that logic, societal acceptance of painful executions would justify their existence, regardless of their effectiveness as a deterrent or their moral legitimacy.
1.2.6.3.1.2.2. Con: This is a sophistic distinction. The fact that the law allows something does not change the moral or ethical implications of doing it.
1.2.6.3.1.2.2.1. Con: The difference between legitimate and illegitimate force is a real moral difference and not just a sophistical one.
1.2.6.3.1.3. Pro: When the state itself acts cruelly by inflicting pain, it can no longer be said to rest on foundations of morality and justice.
1.2.6.3.1.3.1. Con: Understandings of what constitutes morality and justice differ.
1.2.6.3.1.3.1.1. Pro: The US has experience in painful executions well into the 20th century, such as the lynching of [Jesse Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_of_Jesse_Washington) illustrates. The fascinated crowd watching indicates the general acceptance of cruel torture a few generations ago.
1.2.6.3.1.3.1.2. Pro: [Barbaric punishment](http://www.ishr.org/index.php?id=857) is present in many parts of the world today. Some societies apparently regard this as just. For example, [stoning](http://news.trust.org//item/20130927160132-qt52c/) is legal in countries such as Iran and Somalia.
1.2.6.3.1.3.1.3. Con: There are certain practices that are near-universal in all cultures, like the [incest taboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest_taboo) or other [cultural universals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_universal#List_of_cultural_universals).
1.2.6.3.1.3.2. Pro: States have the duty to protect their citizens and not to inflict pain on them. By doing so, states inflict unnecessary pain that offers no additional protection and therefore is not proportional. This violates the foundations of justice.
1.2.6.3.1.3.2.1. Con: States only have a duty to protect the citizens that honor the social contract. If the protection of those who honor the social contract is perceived to require the inflicting of pain on those who break it, so be it.
1.2.6.3.1.3.2.1.1. Con: A social contract perspective may explain why punishment in general is acceptable, but it does not justify all forms of punishment.
1.2.6.3.1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: If it did, then violation of the social contract would provide grounds for, for example, enslavement or torture.
1.2.6.3.1.4. Pro: Carrying out painful execution will require the state to employ those with the skills and willingness to do so.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1. Pro: Due to social norms against causing suffering, this is likely to skew towards those with problematic personalities, criminal backgrounds and/or mental health conditions.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.1. Pro: This is particularly exacerbated by medical professionals' [Hippocratic Oath](http://www.bu.edu/arion/hippocrates-oath/), which includes swearing not to cause suffering in various relevant forms, excluding them from this role and thereby reducing the pool of potential candidates for this job.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.1.1. Con: It's highly unlikely that established medical professionals would be the kind of candidates that would apply for this job. And, if they were to, the Hippocratic Oath would not follow them after changing jobs.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Drug cocktails of the kind used as standard in executions - and plausibly likely to still be used for painful executions - functionally require an [in-depth understanding of pharmacology and medical processes](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/clinics/dpclinic/LethalInjection/LI/documents/kit/drugs.pdf) \(including, among others, IV insertion and dosage calculation\) to properly use. This functionally means that medical professionals are required.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.1.1.2. Con: There have been calls for courts to require that doctors be [on hand](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/04/30/doctors-in-the-death-chamber/doctors-can-and-do-participate-in-executions) for all executions.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.1.1.3. Con: The Hippocratic Oath is an oath attached to one's medical knowledge and expertise, and as such, does not end when one ceases to call oneself a doctor.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.1.1.4. Con: It is unlikely that work carrying out executions would be a fulltime job. As is currently the case, those participating would likely want to maintain their medical professions.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.1.2. Con: Many people support making exceptions from the Hippocratic Oath because of conflicting rights and duties e.g. abortion, assisted suicide.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: These examples are obviously different from the death penalty, in particular, in the sense that there is a right that the right to life is in conflict with in these cases.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.2. Con: As long as these employees do their job in a satisfactory manner their backgrounds do not matter.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.2.1. Con: The likelihood that they do the job in a satisfactory manner decreases though if their background is dubious.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.3. Pro: There is already [evidence](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/opinion/the-prison-guard-s-psyche.html?_r=0) that this is true of prison guards. There is thus reason to believe that this would be exacerbated by more extreme forms of punishment.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.3.1. Con: Prison guards are a bad comparison as there is the danger that they mistreat inmates. Executioners, in contrast, will be hired to mistreat.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.4. Con: The system of executions can be constructed in a way that limits the direct contact of criminal and executioner, so the job can be attractive also for other people.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.4.1. Con: Visually hiding executions would not make someone uncomfortable with the idea of engaging in torture comfortable with it.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.4.2. Pro: Executions are already carried out by [multiple people](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/how-do-you-get-a-job-as-an-executioner-in-america-526), dividing moral responsibility for death in such a way that nobody is the sole person responsible.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.5. Con: A small number of executions does not require employing new people. Current executioners or correction officers can fulfill that task.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.5.1. Con: Correction officers are entirely unsuited and unqualified to carry out executions.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.5.2. Pro: There are [modern examples](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/how-do-you-get-a-job-as-an-executioner-in-america-526) of corrections officers administering executions.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.5.3. Con: Many of these people will not feel comfortable inflicting pain.
1.2.6.3.1.4.1.6. Con: [Mental health conditions](https://www.thebalance.com/psychological-exams-and-screening-for-police-officers-974785) or a [criminal background](http://criminaljusticecareerscenter.com/criminal-justice-jobs-and-career-planning-guide/#Background_Checks) exclude any candidate from recruitment in the justice system.
1.2.6.3.1.4.2. Pro: Painful execution methods, as distinct from existing methods, may require outlaying costs on training new state employees.
1.2.6.3.1.4.2.1. Pro: Painful executions will require training people in the use of equipment \(substances, programmes, etc.\) and new methods.
1.2.6.3.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Knowledge of [torture methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_methods_of_torture) and [study of pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_for_the_Study_of_Pain) is beneficial to enhance the efficiency of painful executions compared to painless executions.
1.2.6.3.1.4.2.2. Con: Some death penalty executioners [have never been trained](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3481019/Former-executioner-San-Quentin-reveals-killed-prisoners-gas-chamber-without-training-claims-never-haunted-him.html). Probably, there will not be necessity for additional training as well.
1.2.6.3.1.4.2.2.1. Con: This is a serious problem, and one that should clearly be corrected.
1.2.6.3.1.4.2.3. Con: Judging from the low numbers of executions and, consequently, employees needed to conduct them, these costs would likely be small.
1.2.6.3.1.4.3. Con: It is unclear that this will be a significantly greater burden on the state than finding people willing and able to carry out pain-minimising executions.
1.2.6.3.1.4.3.1. Pro: Indeed, the [difficulty](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/science/three-drug-protocol-persists-for-lethal-injections-despite-ease-of-using-one.html?_r=0) of balancing the precise chemical cocktails used in lethal injections makes it likely that the medical proficiency to carry out that task is greater - and more expensive to employ - than that needed for cruder methods.
1.2.6.3.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.4.2.1.1.
1.2.6.3.1.4.4. Con: The process of execution can be easily automated, limiting human participation.
1.2.6.3.1.4.4.1. Con: The process of painful execution, however, cannot be automatized with current technology.
1.2.6.3.1.4.4.1.1. Pro: During executions via electrocution, the team [withdrawns](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods) to the observation room, while the executioner pulls a handle to connect the power supply.
1.2.6.3.1.4.4.2. Pro: Already using electrocution [limits the human involvement](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/descriptions-execution-methods) in the execution.
1.2.6.3.1.4.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.4.4.1.1.
1.2.6.3.1.4.4.3. Con: Executions rely on a variety of things that require human input: accurately calculating dosages or drop heights, restraining those executed, inserting IV drips, and so on. None of these can be reliably automated.
1.2.6.3.1.5. Pro: Painful punishments dehumanize the victim just like the criminal does to the victim.
1.2.6.3.1.5.1. Con: The criminals were already inhuman due to their own actions. If they commit capital-punishment-worthy acts against their fellow humans, we should have no sympathy for them.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2. Con: Dehumanization, for example by depriving criminals of their freedom, is generally accepted as it can be a means to a greater end, for example society-wide deterrence.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1. Pro: Painful methods of execution will serve as a better deterrence for potential offenders than painless methods.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: A painless method of execution is less shocking to the general public than hearing about painful executions and the horrors involved.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: This assumes that executions are public. In the modern world, most executions are not.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Executions are public in the sense that members of the public are aware of them. Thus the public are aware of the death penalty as an institution, and can obtain details about how a specific death sentence plays out through the media.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Executions' course of action and their cruelty are publicized by a variety of organizations, for example the [Death Penalty Information Center](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/).
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The execution of Timothy McVeigh in 2001 was attended by around [300 people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/11/mcveigh.usa) \(most of them victims of bombings in Oklahoma\).
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The very public nature of this terrorist act differentiates it from most other executions, which attract considerably less public interest.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: More than a dozen US states [require](http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=96440) the presence of civilians who are not affiliated with the convict, any victim or the media at executions. This makes the death penalty an intrinsically public affair.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: This applies only to a very small share of the population. The overwhelming majority of US citizens will never witness an execution.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.2. Con: It is unclear why a shocking punishment is a good thing. This could be potentially traumatizing to the general public.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Generally speaking, we do not want people to hold traumatic memories for long periods of time.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.2.2. Con: Societies that practice painful and shocking punishment, such as stoning, are not traumatized to an abnormal degree.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.3. Pro: Shocking punishments gather a lot more public attention and discussion.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Yet there is no evidence that this is the kind of public attention and discussion which benefits deterrence.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.4. Pro: Shocking punishments will be remembered much longer by individuals.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.5. Pro: If administering extra pain in an execution can involve a certain spectacle, this can inflict a sense of respect for law and order among the masses, thus acting as a better deterrence to crime.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.5.1. Con: The spectator can be reasonably sure that she/he will not experience such treatment.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.2. Con: If painful executions were truly an effective deterrence then the method that has been practiced in humanities history would have been maintained as it adequately prevented crime. Criminal activity [was still pervasively](https://ourworldindata.org/homicides/) rampant in those times notwithstanding torture.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.3. Con: There are better ways to improve the deterrence effect of executions.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: The pain is not as much of a deterrent as the execution. However, when the execution is carried out privately, the deterrent effect might be muted. A public execution might have a greater deterrent effect since it would be well known what happened to the criminal.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.4. Pro: The prospect of a painful death is more horrible and shocking than the prospect of a painless death and, thus, is more of a deterrent.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.4.1. Con: There is no reason to assume that someone who thinks they won't get caught or isn't deterred by the prospect of death would in any way be more deterred by the fact that the death would be painful.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.4.2. Con: There is no evidence that the prospect of a painful death affects homicide rates.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: There are countries like Iran or Iraq which have public hanging and stoning as common method of death penalty and much higher homicide rates than China where typical form of death penalty is by firing squad. Homicide rates there are similar \(Iran\) or higher \(Iraq\) than in USA where death penalty isn't supported by all states and is always done by humane non-painful methods. See [homicide rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate).
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5. Con: There is no [evidence](https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/1529-nagin-full-reportpdf) that capital punishment has any deterrent effect. Claiming that corporal punishment would change that is pure speculation.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.1. Con: At the same time, it is pure speculation that a corporal element would not add to the deterrence effect. It has been suggested that, for example, the [terminally](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=_ZQzZf7xAYoC&pg=PA78&dq=%22not+death+itself%22+painful&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22not%20death%20itself%22%20painful&f=false) [ill](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Go-rXlDazOYC&pg=PA23&dq=%22not+death+itself%22+%22process+of+dying%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj87JPz_o_PAhUB32MKHajcDd0Q6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&q=%22not%20death%20itself%22%20%22process%20of%20dying%22&f=false) do not fear death so much as a painful, undignified process of dying.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.1.1. Con: When committing a crime, a painful death sentence is not certain. This makes criminals' fear of pain different from the fear that patients with lethal cancer experience.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.1.2. Con: Criminals rarely know the sanctions for their actions at the time of their crimes.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Surveys suggest that the general public is not well-informed about the [legal system](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/539955/pdf),  [current reforms](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02336666) in the area and their implications - even in the case of [criminal justice majors](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036233190300096X).
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.1.2.2. Pro: The degree of punishment and whether the crime thereby qualifies as a felony is anything but predictable. [Prosecutors](http://thecrimereport.org/2012/12/28/2012-12-study-prosecutorial-discretion-leads-to-inconsistent/#.UOW5Cw9uIio.wordpress) frequently have a broad range of discretion as to what charges to file, and juries can often choose between felony and misdemeanor convictions, resulting in inconsistency.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.1.3. Con: There may quite likely be a vast difference between the psychological makeup of terminally ill patients and death row criminals. A comparison between the two without presenting evidence to back up their similarity is also pure speculation.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.3.1.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3. Pro: The [presence](http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5970&context=jclc) of a death penalty does not have an effect on homicide rates.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1. Pro: US states without the death penalty tend to have [lower rates of murder](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/22/us/absence-executions-special-report-states-with-no-death-penalty-share-lower.html), supporting the premise that the strength of the penalty is not impacting the decisions of perpetrators.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.1. Con: The relationship between the lower rates of murder and the existence of the death penalty in the law can be just a correlation not causation.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.2. Con: There are other factors that are better at explaining lower rates of murders.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: More access to guns and leaner restrictions on gun-owners causes more firearm murders.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: A 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlates with a [roughly 0.9 percent rise](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301409) in the firearm homicide rate at the state level.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Access to firearms [is associated](http://annals.org/aim/article/1814426/accessibility-firearms-risk-suicide-homicide-victimization-among-household-members-systematic) with the risk of being the victim of homicide.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: In the United States, the states that impose the strongest restrictions on gun owners have the [lowest rates](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/the-states-with-the-most-gun-laws-see-the-fewest-gun-related-deaths/448044/) of gun-related deaths.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.2.1.4. Con: Although guns make it easier to kill, homicide rates would [not necessarily be lower](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/10/06/zero-correlation-between-state-homicide-rate-and-state-gun-laws/?utm_term=.e52255f3422b#comments) without guns. Homicides committed with a gun might be committed with a different weapon and homicides that are prevented by guns would take place.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.2.2. Pro: Demographic factors such as [race and sex](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htius.pdf) influence the murder rate. For example, in communities with more black males, statistically more murders occur.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: Race is a [better predictor](https://socant.chass.ncsu.edu/documents/McCall,_P_2.pdf) of homicide than unemployment, poverty, and median income in 78% cases, and a better predictor than income inequality in 89% cases.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.2.2.2. Con: These [statistics](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/opinion/charles-blow-crime-bias-and-statistics.html) can be misleading because of existing [racial bias](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Race-and-Punishment.pdf) in the justice system that produces them.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.2.3. Con: These factors may also contribute, but also vary widely across the full spectrum of states' variable death penalty policies. As such, the trendline still acts as good evidence that the existence of the death penalty negatively correlates with homicide rates.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.4. Con: The death penalty works as a [deterrent](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/11/AR2007061100406.html).
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.4.1. Con: The study in question is largely correlative. It is impossible know if the correlation is a result of the death penalty or rather a [general decline in crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States) during the late 20th century.

[www.sas.rochester.edu](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/psc/clarke/214/MocanGitting.pdf)
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.4.2. Con: The small number of executions skews any study about the death penalty deterrent effect.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.4.2.1. Pro: Only [15%](https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/1529-nagin-full-reportpdf) of people who have been sentenced to death since 1976 have actually been executed and a large fraction of death sentences are subsequently reversed. Thus, there is no certainty.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.4.3. Pro: Each execution results, on average, in 18 fewer murders \([Rubin/Shepherd, p. 2](http://cjlf.org/deathpenalty/DezRubShepDeterFinal.pdf)\).
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.4.4. Pro: In six selected cities in the US homicide rates declined after the introduction of the death penalty \([Mocan & Gittings, pp. 64](http://www.nber.org/papers/w12631.pdf)\).
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.5. Pro: Possible offenders cannot imagine the endless uncertainty of waiting for years, writing to the governor etc. Thus this prospect alone will not deter them.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.6. Con: There is [strong evidence](http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Deterrence-in-Criminal-Justice.pdf) that the severity of a prison sentence does not increase its society-wide deterrence effect; what promotes deterrence is rather the certainty of punishment.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.6.1. Con: This study argues that more severe punishment does reduce recidivism rates. This evidence cannot be taken for granted in cases of capital punishment as criminals are certain they will not enter society again.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.6.2. Con: As the certainty of punishment in cases of crimes that warrant the death penalty is very high, the only way to enhance deterrence is enhancing the severity of punishment.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.4.2.1.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.6.2.2. Con: The bar to people believing that punishment is likely is less related to the certainty of imposition of punishment on those found guilty, and rather related to the chances of being caught and successfully prosecuted. Police fail to make an arrest in around [a third of US homicides](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21656725-police-fail-make-arrest-more-third-nations-killings-getting-away), and enhancing the punishment will have little effect on that rate.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.1.2.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.6.4. Con: The evidence is limited to the severity of a prison sentence. The death penalty is different in nature and thus not comparable.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.7. Con: -> See 1.2.6.1.3.1.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.8. Con: The crimes that attract the death penalty - most particularly, murder - do not tend to respond well to punishment-based deterrents, as the nature of these crimes is such that those committing them are often not thinking about the consequences. The addition of pain to executions thus provides no additional deterrent effect.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.1.3.1.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.3.1.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.6.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.9. Con: Or it might make criminals who are aware of the deterrent even more desperate. Capital punishment, no matter how painful, has hardly deterred mass killers who readily shoot themselves at the end of their violent killing sprees.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.6.
1.2.6.3.1.5.2.3. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.
1.2.6.3.1.6. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.2.6.3.2. Con: [Immanuel Kant argued](http://www1.american.edu/dgolash/Kant_on_Punishment.html) that the only legitimate form of punishment the court can prescribe must be based on retribution and no other principle.
1.2.6.3.2.1. Con: What one philosopher argued hundreds of years ago should not relate to how any modern society punishes its criminals.
1.2.6.3.3. Con: Virtually all modern sentencing systems [combine](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=420324) elements of retributive considerations \(p. 46f.\) with concerns such as "deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and denunciation", and are thus vastly more complex than the categories used for philosophical debates.
1.2.6.3.3.1. Con: Even if actual policy decisions are more complicated than theoretical debates, the concepts developed in these theoretical debates are important to the normative grounding for policies, which is what is under consideration in this debate.
1.2.6.3.4. Pro: Utilitarian theories of punishment stress that punishment is only warranted when it prevents harm while inflicting the minimum necessary harm itself.
1.2.6.3.4.1. Pro: Jeremy Bentham, whose reforms were essential to the modern prison system, [rejected retributive theories of punishment](http://www.econlib.org/library/Bentham/bnthPML13.html#Chapter XIII, Cases Unmeet for Punishment) on the grounds that retribution didn't serve the principle of utility.
1.2.6.3.4.1.1. Con: This argument stands on the assumption that painful execution cannot be beneficial in a utilitarian way. This assumption is not warranted as there might be a deterrent effect.
1.2.6.3.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.5.
1.2.6.3.4.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.6.
1.2.6.3.4.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.
1.2.6.3.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.3.
1.2.6.3.4.1.3. Pro: Retribution is primarily oriented towards one's past actions, whereas a utilitarian theory of punishment is oriented towards the maximization of future good at a minimal cost.
1.2.6.3.4.2. Pro: Rawls has [argued](http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Applied/deathpenalty/Rawls.html) that although retribution can be used to justify individual instances of punishment, justification for social practices must be utilitarian.
1.2.6.3.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.4.1.1.
1.2.6.3.4.3. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.4.1.1.
1.2.6.4. Pro: This will provide further closure for the victims of the offender.
1.2.6.4.1. Pro: This would help provide [vengeance](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2014/04/clayton_lockett_s_botched_execution_the_grim_but_predictable_result_of_oklahoma.html) for victims and their loved ones.
1.2.6.4.1.1. Con: Many victims and their families do not want vengeance, they want justice. The two are not synonymous.
1.2.6.4.1.2. Con: Including vengeance, especially against innocent people, as a legal consideration undermines the legitimacy of the punishment.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1. Pro: If the state practices vengeance it will be seen as barbaric instead of [civilized](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/death-penalty-pain/). This undermines its legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1. Pro: For the state to remain a source of justice, it can not be seen to revel in pain. Justice must remain a tool to protect people and to keep society running, not to indulge bloodlust and anger.
1.2.6.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Prisons are already seen as painful and negative.
1.2.6.4.1.3. Con: Existing punishments - including the death penalty - already allow victims and their loved ones to feel avenged.
1.2.6.4.1.4. Con: Victims and their loved ones may just as easily be appalled by the cruelty inflicted in their name.
1.2.6.4.2. Con: Alternatively, this may make victims feel morally responsible for something they view as abhorrent - torture - damaging the closure that a conviction and sentence can provide.
1.2.6.5. Pro: If the purpose of capital punishment is to actually "punish", killing the culprit painlessly can be said to actually be a relief \(from harsh existence\). The punishment is in the pain of execution.
1.2.6.5.1. Con: On average, an inmate on death row has to wait for over a [decade](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/time-death-row) before they are executed. The time spent contemplating death in prison involves considerable psychological torment.
1.2.6.5.2. Con: Ending someone's life ends any possibility of future joy or pleasure for that person. This is a substantial punishment.
1.2.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.2.6.7. Con: Even if the crime involved pain, there is no way of proving how much pain was inflicted to cause the "same pain" to the offender.
1.2.6.7.1. Con: The penal system does not have to inflict "the same pain" experienced by the victim/s to effectively punish the perpetrator of a particularly heinous crime. Rather, it could inflict different levels of pain to different offenders, based on the gravity of their actions. For example, a serial killer would die a more painful death than a non-murderous drug trafficker.
1.2.6.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.5.8.1.
1.2.6.8. Con: The convict's family will have to live with the fact that their loved one suffered during his/her last moments alive.
1.2.6.8.1. Con: In the same way, the families of prisoners have to live with the fact that their loved one is being deprived of his/her freedom. A punishment is not determined by the effect it has on third parties, but based on the crime committed.
1.2.6.8.1.1. Con: The age old principle of an eye for an eye justifies that prisoners can be executed painfully.
1.2.6.8.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.
1.2.6.8.1.1.2. Pro: [35%](http://www.gallup.com/poll/178799/americans-eye-eye-top-reason-death-penalty.aspx) of Americans who approve of the death penalty accept the "an eye for an eye" principle as a main reason for the death penalty.
1.2.6.8.1.1.2.1. Con: Among those who support the death penalty, the share who do so for this reason has been [steadily declining](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1606/death-penalty.aspx), from 50% in 1991 to 35% in 2014, indicating that this idea is falling out of fashion.
1.2.7. Pro: Painful executions are considered a more severe punishment than a prisoner peacefully slipping away towards death.
1.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.
1.2.9. Pro: The prospect of pain makes the punishment more effective as it gives another reason to cooperate with the authorities.
1.2.9.1. Pro: The prospect of not merely death but a painful death can be a decisive factor in convincing a criminal to cooperate with the authorities prior to their conviction - for example, by providing information in order to mitigate the punishment.
1.2.9.1.1. Con: Investigators are not the ones who determine sentences. This makes their threats less credible.
1.2.9.1.1.1. Pro: [Plea bargains](https://law.stanford.edu/publications/plea-bargainings-triumph-a-history-of-plea-bargaining-in-america/) are agreements between prosecutors and defendants, in which defendants agree to plead guilty and cooperate in investigations/others' trials in return for leniency.
1.2.9.1.1.2. Pro: The [vast majority of criminal cases](https://www.bja.gov/Publications/PleaBargainingResearchSummary.pdf) in the US are resolved through plea bargaining, which gives the prosecutor an upper hand in dealings with the accused.
1.2.9.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.1.
1.2.9.1.3. Con: The same could be argued about [torture](https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/nov/04/2) but this does not work there either.
1.2.9.1.3.1. Con: A main factor in why torture does not work is that people will say anything while in pain. This is different in interrogations that just threaten a painful execution.
1.2.9.2. Con: If the prospect of receiving the death penalty itself is not a sufficient motivation for those accused of crimes to cooperate with authorities, the addition of pain is unlikely to make a difference.
1.2.9.2.1. Con: The death penalty might not be a sufficient motivation because the convict believes she/he would be killed once out of prison or even in prison.
1.2.10. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.
1.2.11. Con: The goal of all criminal punishment should be to remove dangerous criminals from the public and rehabilitate them. If someone is deemed past the point of rehabilitation, our goal should be to simply remove them from the public permanently. We are not trying to make them "pay" for their crimes, just trying to protect others.
1.3. Con: If the infliction of pain becomes acceptable in the case of criminals, it is more likely to be seen as acceptable in other forms and the resurgence of such cruel acts becomes more likely.
1.3.1. Con: Execution for criminals should be the only stronghold of pain in a developed society. It should be done with abhorrence.
1.3.2. Pro: Painful executions have detrimental effects on society as they dull people's sensitivity toward human suffering. This phenomenon has been recognized and given a name: "compassion fatigue."
1.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.1.1.
1.3.2.2. Con: People's sensitivity towards human suffering could increase if people were to witness and hear about the victims' experiences.
1.3.2.3. Pro: Three years of media coverage of the [Syrian Civil War](http://www.dailysabah.com/columns/ibrahim-kalin/2014/09/23/the-syrian-war-indifference-to-human-suffering) dulled people's sensitivity to the human suffering there. Likewise painful executions, once routine, will dull people's concern.
1.3.2.4. Con: As the [source](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/susan-d-moeller-2/compassion-fatigue-how-the-media-sell-disease-f/) implies, this refers to "disease, famine, war, and death", none of which affect the US. Painful executions, on the other hand, would take place at home and probably result in less compassion fatigue.
1.3.2.4.1. Con: The deaths of US soldiers might happen abroad but affect families at home.
1.3.3. Con: This argument represents a [slippery slope fallacy](http://www.logicalfallacies.info/presumption/slippery-slope/). It is by no means certain that the infliction of pain being accepted in a certain context makes it more likely to be accepted in other contexts.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Legalization of marijuana was repeatedly opposed by slippery slope arguments that marijuana consumption is a gateway to heavy drug abuse, such as in [California](http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/16/opinion/la-oe-rutten16-2009dec16) or [North Carolina](https://elevatenv.com/elevate-your-state-north-carolina/). Yet, the example of [Colorado](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/dose-reality-effect-state-marijuana-legalizations) illustrates that these concerns did not materialize.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Marijuana was only legalised in Colorado in 2014. This is an insufficient period of time to measure whether this will lead to greater acceptance, preponderance or use of other more dangerous drugs.
1.3.3.2. Pro: The government imprisons people, but that does not make kidnapping any more prevalent.
1.3.4. Pro: If some criminals are killed painfully, people will see painful punishments as a legitimate government action. This may desensitize people to the moral abhorrence of actions such as torture.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Many people have a strong reverence for the government and its laws. Seeing the government commit these actions could establish political and social legitimacy for these immoral actions.
1.3.5. Pro: Crimes that warrant the death penalty [historically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_the_United_States_federal_government#History) have been extended.
1.3.6. Pro: The government [sets the tone](http://observer.com/2016/12/nypd-reports-huge-spike-in-hate-crimes-since-donald-trumps-election/) for [society in general](http://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2016/11/30/report-trumps-election-led-to-a-surge-in-hate-crime-infographic/#1018ecb75f0d). If the government kills people in painful, horrifying ways, brutality becomes more normal and acceptable in all facets of life \(e.g., domestic violence, hate crimes, beatings caused by disagreements, etc.\).
1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.5.2.1.
1.5. Con: Painful executions harm innocent people more than conventional capital punishment.
1.5.1. Con: The pain would likely deter at least one murder incident, which outweighs all harm done to criminals \(not counting the killing-them part, only the whether-to-cause-pain-while-doing-it part\).
1.5.1.1. Con: There is no evidence that painful executions deter crime. The history of humanity is littered with time periods with painful executions, and they did not have a noticeable effect. There was still crime and executions were still carried out.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Crime rates in the far past are not reported or recorded well enough to determine that painful executions had no effect.
1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: While we have no data due to a lack of official recording and reporting, the rate of executions in the past and the fact they occurred and continued to occur, and were clearly deemed ineffective as they continued to happen and civilisation never entered a crime free golden age, is clear.
1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Crimes warranting an execution \(painful or not\) have evolved over the course of humanity's history. The prevalence of executions in history does not necessarily correlate with a decrease in crime as defined by modern society. For example, nobody is burning heretics at the stake today.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: Correlation can be analyzed, but in order to determine lack of causation between painful executions and crime rates, one must have an experiment. To produce an experiment, different groups would need to have different amounts of pain in execution while having all other factors constant, and such groups are not present in history for analysis of the efficacy of painful executions.
1.5.2. Pro: There are many instances of people being wrongfully convicted for crimes they did not commit. This means there are innocent people on death row. Adding pain would further exacerbate the injustice of executing these [falsely convicted](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-list-those-freed-death-row) individuals.
1.5.2.1. Con: While true, this is a problem of the judicial process leading up to the death penalty, not an intrinsic flaw of a painful death penalty itself.
1.5.2.2. Con: By the same logic, every punishment has to take into account the possibility of a wrong conviction. Prison sentences, then, should be lighter to account for false convictions.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: Prison sentences do not need to be lighter to account for false convictions, because a long sentence can be ended and the victim be compensated when a conviction proves to be false. But one cannot reverse the infliction of pain or death.
1.5.2.3. Pro: False convictions are a non-negligible problem. In the U.S. it is [likely](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/28/how-many-people-are-wrongly-convicted-researchers-do-the-math/) at least 4%. Moreover, false convictions disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities and groups.
1.5.2.4. Pro: Considering the high number of [wrongful executions](http://www.ncadp.org/pages/innocence), adding pain to the death penalty increases the state's failure to provide due legal process.
1.5.3. Pro: Painful executions can cause psychological damage to [those taking part](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/get-psyched/201401/it-s-time-kill-the-death-penalty). With an eye to their mental health, executions should not be painful.
1.5.3.1. Pro: More than a dozen of the US states that enact the death penalty [require](http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=96440) the presence of civilian witnesses who are not affiliated with the convict, any victim or the media.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: The decision for civilians to witnesses an execution is voluntary. Anyone who watches does so at their own risk.
1.5.3.2. Pro: Painful executions would require the executioner to engage in torture, something that can cause serious [psychological damage](http://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/14/science/the-torturer-s-mind-complex-view-emerges.html?pagewanted=all).
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: The [experience](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/opinion/sunday/what-i-learned-from-executing-two-men.html) of the person in charge of Oregon's executions supports this view.  In particular, he writes "I cannot put into words the anxiety I felt about the possibility of a botched procedure."
1.5.3.2.1.1. Con: That is because the accepted method of execution in the state of Oregon is not supposed to hurt. Hence, the executioner would obviously not want to deviate from that. Should painful executions be the norm, then the fear of a "botched procedure" would be different.
1.5.3.3. Pro: As prison workers are not involved with the sentencing process and didn't see the evidence, their doubt regarding the guilt of the condemned is a [heavy burden](http://www.ncadp.org/pages/harm-to-prison-workers) on their consciences. Having them inflict pain only makes this worse.
1.5.3.4. Pro: [Jurors](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/so-sue-me/201503/the-hidden-horrors-jury-duty) suffer from a burden of responsibility. Making executions painful increases this.
1.5.3.5. Con: The suffering of the convict can be rendered invisible. Muscle relaxants such as [pancuronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancuronium_bromide) prevent any movements or verbal reaction yet do not impede on consciousness.
1.5.3.5.1. Con: The use of muscle relaxants, at the same time, mostly voids the intended deterrence effect of painful executions towards the public.
1.5.3.5.1.1. Con: Painful executions are not necessarily meant to serve as better deterrence.
1.5.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.
1.5.3.5.1.2. Con: The actual execution is witnessed by very few people. The deterrence lies in the knowledge that your death would be painful, rather than in the actual act of witnessing the execution.
1.5.3.5.2. Con: This is just describing a new and horrific way to kill someone. Knowing that you executed them in such a way as to cause intense suffering and terrifying paralysis might be an even more haunting experience than executing someone in a more traditionally savage way.
1.5.3.6. Pro: Executions should be observable for a wide public, and not only for its most hard-boiled members. After all, and as one journalist [put it](https://reason.com/reasontv/2015/03/06/death-penalty-transparency): "with something as serious as the wielding of state power to kill somebody, there should be maximum transparency".
1.5.3.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.
1.5.3.6.2. Con: Historically, more painful executions have attracted more spectators. In this sense, adding pain makes executions more transparent.
1.5.3.6.2.1. Con: There is no evidence for the claim that painful executions attract a larger audience than pain-free executions.
1.5.3.6.2.2. Pro: Brutal punishments have attracted the public from the times of the brutal executions of the leaders of the [Münster Rebellion 1534](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnster_Rebellion) to the lynching of [Jesse Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_of_Jesse_Washington) in 1916.
1.5.3.7. Pro: Every citizen of a democratic state where this took place would be aware that they are complicit with intentionally cruelly torturing people to death.
1.5.4. Pro: Painful executions cause more suffering for the loved ones of the executed person.
1.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.4.1.
1.5.5. Con: By this logic, only a minimal degree of punishment would ever be acceptable as even imprisonment and monetary fines hurt 'bystanders', for example relatives of the convict. Drawing the line at painful executions is thus arbitrary.
1.5.5.1. Con: It might be that other forms of punishment currently practiced are indefensible also. In this case, there would be no slippery slope.
1.5.5.2. Con: It does not have to be arbitrary. You can pick some optimization which maximizes punishment and minimizes trauma to the punishers.
1.6. Con: Painful executions threaten the existence of capital punishment, as they will further ignite activists.
1.6.1. Pro: The support for capital punishment has been declining as there has been increasing [media coverage](http://www.csg.org/pubs/capitolideas/enews/issue65_4.aspx) of the pain associated with lethal injection. Making executions painful could jeopardize the acceptance of capital punishment in general.
1.6.2. Con: -> See discussion #801: Capital punishment should be abolished in the United States.
1.6.3. Con: It is a strategic choice for activists to target the recently added element of pain before demanding an end to capital punishment because it is has a higher chance of success.
1.6.3.1. Con: Initially demanding both is a better negotiation position as one can cede later on some issues.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Civil society activists are more likely to generate widespread support with less extreme demands.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Statistically, people's opinions can be characterized by [standard deviation](http://www.popularsocialscience.com/2013/08/26/can-we-trust-opinion-polls-the-central-limit-theorem-binomial-proportion-confidence-intervals-and-likely-voters/). Being more to the center allows for more overlap between citizens and activists.
1.6.3.2.2. Con: One political tactic is to make extreme demands, which then allows similar but less extreme demands to appear reasonable.
1.6.4. Pro: [61%](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FactSheet.pdf) of voters would choose a punishment other than the death penalty for murders. They would be against making capital punishment more severe.
1.6.5. Con: [Activists](http://www.ncadp.org/pages/about-us) against the death penalty are mobilised by the right to life. How executions are performed may not be an issue that will increase their mobilisation.
1.6.5.1. Con: A painful denial of the right to life is surely more reason for activists to worry than a painless denial of the right to life. Indeed, activists often make [references](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/29/supreme-court-oklahoma-execution-torture-cruel-and-unusual-punishment-) to cruelty and torture in their arguments.
1.6.6. Con: Because society changes incrementally the painfulness would be abolished before the death sentence in its entirety.
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.5.
1.8. Pro: Capital punishment is often justified by pointing out that the convict has forfeited their basic [right to life](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty/). If they have forfeited this right then they have also forfeited the right to bodily integrity. Thus the government is free to execute them in any way.
1.8.1. Con: Life and bodily integrity are separate.
1.8.2. Con: Even if a criminal forfeits their rights to life and bodily integrity, we, non-criminals, have not forfeited our duty not to harm.
1.8.3. Con: All humans, regardless of wrongdoing, deserve basic human dignity. Painful executions violate this moral standard.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Painful executions legitimize the idea that those who have broken the law are not humans with the potential for redemption and deserving of respect.
1.8.3.1.1. Pro: An example of this is seen in the breakdown of human rights in the [Duterte](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/un-official-trump-duterte-breaking-long-held-taboos-on-torture/article/2627179) [regime](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/filipino-philippines-prison-jail-president-rodrigo-duterte-war-on-drugs-a7164006.html).
1.8.3.2. Pro: Human dignity is the basis of fundamental human rights. It is [inviolable](http://www.humandignitytrust.org/pages/OUR%20WORK/Why%20Human%20Dignity) and it must be respected and protected.
1.8.3.3. Con: Human dignity is a vague abstract theoretical construct that has limited use in solving important real-life dillemmas. There is no reason apart from axiological assumptions to justify its relevance.
1.8.3.3.1. Con: Human dignity is a consideration when solving real-life dilemmas such as in [paediatrics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17425150) or [robot care](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-014-9338-5) for older people.
1.8.3.3.2. Pro: Human dignity means [different things](https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article/19/4/655/349356/Human-Dignity-and-Judicial-Interpretation-of-Human) to different people in different contexts and that makes it difficult to apply in practice.
1.8.3.4. Pro: Part of the reason that painful executions strip away human dignity is because these people are going to die anyway. Making their death painful does nothing but cause unnecessary additional suffering.
1.8.3.5. Pro: Insofar as torture is [incompatible with the good will](https://kantphilosophy.wordpress.com/kants-ethics/the-good-will/), it is inconsistent with deontological moral standards,
1.8.3.5.1. Pro: Imagine a world where people could walk up to people, and torture them to death for some perceived slight, is this not a repulsive idea? It is hard to see how painful punishments differs from this.
1.8.4. Con: Although a [few](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-punishment/) legal theorists argue that the right to life is forfeited, this is view is not commonly accepted by most legal theorists.
1.8.5. Con: Basic human rights [cannot be lost](http://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/centres/social-justice/working-papers/SJ020_Miller_Are%20Human%20Rights%20Conditional%20final%20draft.pdf), forfeited or alienated.
1.8.5.1. Con: The idea that even the right to life can be lost is already well-established. Article 6 of the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx), for example, mentions that people can be deprived of the right to life as long as this does not happen in an arbitrary fashion.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: The International Covenant states that the right to life can be limited. In contrast, absolute rights cannot be limited, such as those against torture and slavery. This shows that there is a hierarchy and the right to life is not at the top of it.
1.8.5.2. Pro: To be free from torture or slavery are [absolute rights](https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/HumanRights/Human-rights-scrutiny/PublicSectorGuidanceSheets/Pages/Absoluterights.aspx) and therefore cannot be limited for any reason.
1.8.5.2.1. Pro: Because there is no justification for [infringing](https://academic.oup.com/hrlr/article-abstract/12/4/723/628905/What-is-an-absolute-right-Deciphering-Absoluteness?redirectedFrom=fulltext) absolute rights they can only be violated. In contrast, non-absolute rights can be justifiable infringed and therewith can be overridden.
1.8.5.2.2. Pro: Absolute laws are spelled out in the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx). Neither Article 7 on torture nor Article 8 on slavery contains provision that allow for limitations.
1.8.5.2.3. Con: There are situations in which rights conflict with absolute rights. This illustrates how even absolute rights can be limited.
1.8.5.2.3.1. Con: In these cases, the absolute rights are prioritised.
1.8.5.2.3.2. Pro: From a normative perspective there should be no absolute rights as it is better to torture someone in return for a city being spared from a nuclear attack.
1.8.5.3. Pro: Even if the convict has forfeited a right to life, that does not mean that the convict has forfeited the right to a minimum of respect and a proportionate punishment.
1.8.5.3.1. Pro: [Proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_\(law\)) is a universal legal principle and its existence is not linked to individual actions.
1.8.6. Pro: Rights exist only because of the state's existence \(a body that can enforce them\). Once the state regards the criminal as not part of it, then the criminal has no rights.
1.8.6.1. Con: Human rights exists beyond the state as they are [inalienable](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/).
1.8.6.2. Pro: If rights \(e.g. human rights\) are not or cannot be enforced by the state, they become empty recommendations and do not have any significance in practice.
1.8.6.3. Con: To argue that states can choose not to recognise rights because rights only exist when states recognise them is circular.
1.8.6.4. Con: Governments are instated to protect natural rights. To claim that rights derive their existence from the state contradicts this assertion, and also denies the very existence of natural rights. The claim may be consistent with some world views, but is fundamentally incompatible with the philosophy underlying the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
1.8.6.4.1. Con: There is no such thing as a "natural right." Even the very [philosophical theory behind it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law) was thought out by humans. Nature does not choose what rights to give—humans do.
1.8.6.4.2. Con: The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were not God- or Nature-given, no matter what they claim. They are self-evidently the end result of the intellect, effort, and collaboration of a small group of men with a specific vision of the future.
1.8.7. Con: In the US there is a tradition of the "last meal" that exemplifies the basic respect which is given to every person regardless of the death sentence.
1.8.8. Con: This would mean that by committing any crime a person forfeits all of his/her rights. The most minor rights violations would deprive him/her of the right to object to any treatment \(e.g. torture, disproportional sentence, etc.\).
1.8.8.1. Con: The notion that all levels of crime require the same punishment and involve the same loss of rights has not been asserted. Petty theft may enable the state to decline your rights to property in the form of paying reparations to the victim. This is necessarily antithetical to the claim that all crimes require the same loss of rights.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.2.3.5.8.1.
1.10. Con: Torture is prohibited in the United States by the [8th Amendment](http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-viii), which prohibits a death penalty that is unnecessarily "cruel" for the sake of inflicting pain - and, on top of that, "unusual" [in the sense that](http://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-viii/against-cruel-innovation-the-original-meaning-of-the-cruel-and-unusual-puni/clause/10) it goes against long-standing and accepted practices.
1.10.1. Pro: Nebraska's Supreme Court [ruled](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/09/us/09penalty.html) in 2008 that electrocution is not legal under the state's ban of cruel and unusual punishment as the "condemned prisoners must not be tortured to death, regardless of their crimes".
1.10.2. Pro: A federal judge in Tennessee [ruled](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-19-tenn-lethal-injection_N.htm) in 2007 that the state's lethal injection procedure is not legal as it "presents a substantial risk of unnecessary pain".
1.10.3. Con: What constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment is open to definition reflecting the spirit of the times.
1.10.3.1. Con: It does not matter what the punishment is, but rather the intention to cause suffering that makes it unconstitutional. While cultural values may determine what "suffering" is and how it differs from "discomfort", it is the deliberate cause of suffering specifically that makes it cruel.
1.10.3.2. Pro: In 1792, one year after the 8th Amendment was introduced, all executions in the US took place [via hanging](http://deathpenaltyusa.org/usa1/date/1792.htm) - which has since fallen out of favor [due to](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Kl02wCpMWxkC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=why+hanging+uncommon+death+penalty&source=bl&ots=gVcHD15ox1&sig=mPA50yDO3f_-GsACGMXppOUCN24&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihi5Gg2obPAhVBs5QKHVkqCOA4ChDoAQgqMAI#v=onepage&q=why%20hanging%20uncommon%20death%20penalty&f=false) the possibility of a slow and cruel death.
1.10.3.2.1. Con: At the time, all available methods of execution had a risk of a "slow and cruel death".
1.10.3.3. Con: [Current constitutional law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/death_penalty), which takes precedence over past interpretations, regards unnecessarily painful executions as conflicting with the 8th Amendment.
1.10.3.4. Con: These changes by definition reflect the state finding increasingly more humane methods, and so abandoning the previous best available option accordingly. That in no way justifies the conclusion that changes can or should be made in the opposite direction.
1.10.3.4.1. Pro: There is a general decline and distaste for [violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature). Interpretations of what constitutes 'cruel' are unlikely to become more lenient.
1.10.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.1.1.1.1.
1.10.3.6. Con: This argument presupposes absolute moral relativism. That morals and sensibilities change with time and location is not by itself sufficient to justify changing laws.
1.10.4. Pro: The position of the Supreme Court remains that the death penalty itself is not unconstitutional, but that states must use it [in proportion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/death_penalty) to the crime and with the [least painful method available](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/us/supreme-court-execution-drug.html?_r=1).
1.10.4.1. Con: Just because the Supreme Court supports a painless death penalty does not mean its ruling is correct, and hence this is not a rebuttal to the prior points.
1.10.4.1.1. Con: The reasons as to why the Supreme Court may have ruled so are valid points, however.
1.10.5. Con: In enacting this policy, it will be necessary to change the Constitution. This has been done before.
1.10.5.1. Con: Constitutions seldom change. In the 229 years since its enactment, the American Constitution has undergone [only 27 amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution), even though thousands [have been proposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proposed_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Proposed_amendments_not_approved_by_Congress).
1.10.5.1.1. Con: Even if changes only happen rarely, they do nonetheless happen. This is sufficient to prove the point that 'constitutions can be amended'. It is not necessary to show that changes occur with any frequency.
1.10.5.2. Pro: For example, numerous past amendments to the American Constitution have clarified who is allowed to vote, for example based on race, color and previous servitude \([15th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\), on sex \([19th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\) and on age \([26th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\).
1.10.5.3. Con: It can be changed, yes, but this is not a reason why it should be changed. The Constitution was written with a certain degree of care, and reason in order to protect everyone's rights, we should show the same amount of care when making revisions to it.
1.10.5.4. Con: Constitutional law acts not only as the law of the land, but as an authority on moral issues.
1.10.6. Con: "Cruel" could be proportional to the amount of misery created by the perpetrator.
1.10.6.1. Con: The prohibition is not on unnecessarily or unduly cruel punishments; it is on cruel and unusual punishments.
1.11. Con: Painful executions equal torture and are therefore not acceptable.
1.11.1. Pro: The prospect of torture damages the government's moral standing and reputation.
1.11.1.1. Pro: The problem with threats is that they deter people from admitting to things they've done rather from actually doing them in the first place, especially when those threats are made on behalf of the wronged party or victim, as in the case of capital punishment, rather than by them themselves.
1.11.2. Con: Torture is intended to [compel some action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture) from those being tortured. Therefore capital punishment can not be torture because no action can be compelled from the dead.
1.11.3. Con: The pain criminals feel is irrelevant if they are regardless going to die. Discussion on this issue should be about whether it is useful to kill them this way.
1.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.10.
1.11.5. Pro: Torture goes against moral standards.
1.11.5.1. Pro: Painful executions threaten the moral fabric of society and all the progress we have made over the past several thousand years to advance and better ourselves, to become "civilised".
1.11.5.1.1. Pro: Pain for Pains sake is sadistic and barbaric and serves little purpose but the gratification and enjoyment of the person inflicting the pain, or those watching, in much the same way as a blood-sport or other past times that we as a society have rejected and moved on from.
1.11.5.1.1.1. Pro: Currently, we as a society consider those who like or enjoy inflicting pain on others to be mentally ill, devoid of empathy and often psychopathic.
1.11.5.1.1.1.1. Pro: Ironically, a high percentage of those that commit criminal acts, especially murder, are considered psychopathic and without remorse. Intentionally inflicting pain would make the state no better than the criminal they seek to punish.
1.11.5.1.1.2. Pro: To go back to ways we have previously denounced would be regression.
1.11.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.
1.11.5.3. Con: [About 60%](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/09/global-opinion-use-of-torture/) of Americans are not opposed to torture in principle.
1.11.5.3.1. Con: This is in answer to questions that imply that terrorist attacks could be prevented through torture. This benefit of torture is not available in the case of painful executions; public opinion would thus almost certainly be less supportive of torture in this case.
1.11.5.3.2. Con: This is an appeal to popularity. Just because a majority holds a certain stance doesn't automatically validate it as true or as a moral absolute.
1.11.5.4. Pro: Causing another human being to suffer, when that does not negate the suffering of another, is immoral.
1.11.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.5.
1.11.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.3.1.
1.11.7. Con: -> See 1.2.6.
1.11.8. Con: -> See 1.11.5.3.
1.11.9. Pro: Torture violates several international agreements that the United States has signed.
1.11.9.1. Pro: Torture violates the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), which bans it in Article 5, and which the US has signed.
1.11.9.2. Pro: As part of the United Nations Economic and Social Council \(ECOSOC\), the United States stands behind the [recommended safeguard](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/DeathPenalty.aspx) that capital punishment should "inflict the minimum possible suffering".
1.11.9.2.1. Con: ECOSOC safeguards are [non-binding.](https://www.google.pl/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjE0d6dgcLRAhVEP5oKHehEBzkQFggaMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amnesty.org%2Fdownload%2FDocuments%2F156000%2Fact500061997en.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFdW044vlYwYODcC0I9sSIT1XiteQ&sig2=wBVQxv2oE2kojHYT4cWDow&bvm=bv.144224172,d.bGs)
1.11.9.3. Pro: The US has signed the [UN Convention against Torture](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/United_Nations_Convention_against_Torture), which prohibits the use of torture.
1.11.9.3.1. Con: The importance of the Convention is illusory. Among the participants are [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning) and [China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/china-still-uses-medieval-torture-methods-against-opponents-amnesty), which use inhuman punishments and torture.
1.11.9.3.1.1. Con: China and Saudi Arabia are not good comparisons, because the US is a leader in [soft power](http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/ranking/). Having a bad international reputation will hurt the US more.
1.11.9.3.1.2. Con: Breaches of a treaty by other signatories do not justify breaching the treaty oneself.
1.11.9.4. Pro: The Geneva Convention [forbids torture](http://www.cfr.org/international-law/united-states-geneva-conventions/p11485#p2). While it only applies during wars, this means that captured enemy soldiers are treated more humanely than a convicted murderer would be in his own country.
1.11.9.5. Con: The United States routinely violates international agreements it has signed.
1.11.9.5.1. Pro: America's political culture disregards international affairs and opinion, and its domestic law is placed above international law. The result is "blatant U.S. violations of binding international legal obligations" \([Koplow, p. 53, 70](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/579fc2ad725e253a86230610/t/57ec7e81d1758e495873cabc/1475116674603/Koplow_37-1.pdf)\).
1.11.9.5.2. Con: America's previous failures do not justify another egregious violation of binding international law.
1.11.9.6. Con: America is in a power position in which it does not need to fear repercussions for breaking international law \([Koplow, p. 70](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/579fc2ad725e253a86230610/t/57ec7e81d1758e495873cabc/1475116674603/Koplow_37-1.pdf)\).
1.12. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.13. Con: A painful execution, which can be regarded as torture, damages the nation's international reputation.
1.13.1. Con: Policy making in the United States is and should be, first and foremost, made based on the popular will, not based on considerations about how these policies might affect the state's reputation abroad.
1.13.1.1. Con: A society's reputation and moral standing concern more than just its own citizenry. We often compare the moral decisions of one legal system to another with respect to both time \(critiquing past legal systems\) and place \(critiquing other moral systems\).
1.13.1.2. Con: Outside constraints, such as the threat of war, can force policy makers to make decisions that run counter to the popular will and still be beneficial.
1.13.2. Con: A total of [54 countries](http://www.vox.com/2014/12/9/7361291/map-cia/in/7125250) helped the US carry out its rendition program, which has been linked to torture, among them some of the US' closest allies. It is therefore unlikely that it will damage the relationship of the US with these states.
1.13.2.1. Con: In many of these countries, the state support for the CIA's torture program was a [state secret](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/09/cia-torture-report-europe-complicity-britain) and kept from the public, thus preventing damage to the relationship with the US. Full disclosure of the programs - which as of yet has not happened - might have resulted in a different reaction.
1.13.2.1.1. Con: The disclosure was sufficient to show that 54 countries are involved. Any new information is likely to be incremental in effect.
1.13.3. Pro: The death penalty reduces America's soft power in the form of attractiveness abroad and the use of torture makes America look hypocritical \([Nye, p. 267](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/20202345/abstract)\).
1.13.3.1. Con: The mechanisms by which torture translates into reductions of soft power are unclear and rely on an assumption that the public abroad will observe the actions of the US closely.
1.13.3.2. Con: The link between torture and reduction in soft power was [criticized](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.472.4582&rep=rep1&type=pdf) for misusing collective action theory.
1.13.4. Con: Even though the United States used torture and practices the death penalty, most Western countries have a more [favorable](http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/06/28/americas-international-image/) than unfavorable view of the country.
1.13.4.1. Con: Polled citizens of "most Western countries" probably do not focus on the prevalence of torture and the death penalty when assessing their general view of the United States.
1.13.4.2. Con: America may be perceived to have a leadership role yet this does not imply that the use of the death penalty does not harm its reputation abroad.
1.13.4.3. Con: There are many factors that build or damage a state's reputation. The US can have a major role as a world leader, while still having their reputation damaged by the use of the death penalty.
1.13.5. Pro: -> See 1.11.9.3.
1.13.6. Pro: -> See 1.11.9.2.
1.13.7. Con: International relations depend more on mutual tangible benefits rather than on vague "reputation".
1.13.7.1. Con: Reputation creates tangible benefits by attracting the best and brightest employees to the US reducing their turnover rate \(particularly in science and technology\), attracting foreign direct investment and tourists, etc.
1.13.7.2. Con: Reconciliation between states is dependent on soft power rather than based on military or economic facts. [Germany](http://www.wochikochi.jp/english/relayessay/2013/09/cultural-diplomacy01.php), for example, used its cultural foreign policy to establish a friendly image, which eventually helped reconciliation.
1.13.7.3. Pro: A state's reputation can ultimately not protect it from threats and attacks by other states.
1.13.7.4. Con: The use and practice of the death penalty in China can absolutely deter investment, particularly when it is reported in [major international](http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-white-collar-criminals-death-sentence-2013-7?IR=T) [news media](http://www.economist.com/node/9250206).
1.13.7.5. Pro: Torture practices in countries such as China and Saudi Arabia have not deterred politicians and business from there.
1.13.8. Pro: If the US is seen as torturing its own citizens, then enemy nations and terrorist groups have cover for torturing US citizens \(civilians or military personnel\).
