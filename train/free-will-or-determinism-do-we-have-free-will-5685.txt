Discussion Title: Free Will or Determinism: Do We Have Free Will?

1. There is no free will.
1.1. Pro: The notions “freedom” and “will” are not compatible, making the expression 'Free Will' oxymoronic.
1.1.1. Pro: If given the same input we are capable of choosing something other that what we would choose, which would be freedom, we really would not have a will,  Our chooser is more like a Plinko board, a random system.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Will can be defined as [the power of control over one's own actions or emotions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/will). If the "control" is actually random, changing for no reason, it cannot be seen as being my own.
1.1.1.2. Con: If my choices are consistent with my self-defined identity, this does not make my choices random, but simply unique.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The original cause of many decisions for a human being may be one of his own freely willed decision/choice.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: A person can be described as a chain of unique decisions nobody else have made. My identity is this chain of unique choices.
1.1.1.3. Con: To consider randomness as a meaningful concept when it gets to choices is a bias against the concept of identity, therefore against free will.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: For an observer, my identity can only be described as causeless, “I have no reason to be who I am”. To consider it “random” suppose that it could have been different, “I could have been someone else” which is meaningless.
1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: If I was someone else, I would not have been me.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: The concept of free will is to accept that “I”, my identity, can be the cause of my decision. If the concept of identity is meaningless, free will is also meaningless.
1.1.1.4. Pro: Will can be defined [as similar to determination](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/will), which is [the act of deciding definitely and firmly​](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/determination). If we choose differently for no reason, this cannot be considered "definitive" or "firm".
1.1.1.4.1. Con: Free will does not assume that we choose differently "for no reason". It assumes that we choose differently because we will to choose differently. The objection begs the question by assuming that free will is impossible.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: To ignore the agency of the chooser \(by claiming there is "no other reason" for a different choice\) is to evaluate Free Will theory in terms of the deterministic worldview, which is fallacious. Each worldview must be evaluated on its own terms.
1.1.2. Pro: If given the same input we would choose consistently, which would be a true “will”, we are not really free - just bound by the circumstances of our inputs.
1.1.2.1. Con: If only part of the inputs motivating my choice have been freely chose in the past \(such like my personality, my beliefs, etc\) then a true “free will” is meaningful, because it combines the consistency of the will with the freedom of my choices.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Even if we are free for a single choice, we would still have free will.
1.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.
1.1.2.3. Con: What makes my choice a free choice is not what I choose, but that I could have chosen differently.
1.1.3. Pro: Will, as a choice according to preferences, is not compatible with a non-deterministic freedom, independent of preferences.
1.1.4. Con: "Free will" is an expression taken to mean that one has agency, or the ability to make a choice from various courses of action. The fact that to a given individual the words "free" and "will" have associations that make the literal joining of the two incompatible is not relevant.
1.1.4.1. Con: If the expression "free will" is a relevant expression of the concept of agency, if "free will" is oxymoric that would demonstrate that the concept of agency is incoherent.
1.1.4.2. Con: If there is no better way than "free will" to explain what agency means for a given individual with a practical everyday vocabulary, it is most likely irrelevant to a practical everyday life. And since agency is claimed to be an everyday feature, it would be unlikely that it exists.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Agency is extraordinarily easy to define. It is the ability to do or refrain from doing anything that is possible, given physical laws.
1.1.4.2.2. Con: Agency means that the individual is the cause of the action; and that the individual could have caused a different action, had he wished.
1.1.4.2.3. Pro: The paradox observed in the expression "free will" applies to "agency" if agency is a simple "ability". Let's consider a given individual in a given situation of choice. If this ability can only be exercised consistently \(consistent choices\), then this is indistinguishable from "Determinism". If it leads to inconsistent choices, this is a random system  independent from the individual, and therefore still indistinguishable from "Determinism".
1.1.4.3. Pro: Homonyms are not synonyms, similarly expressions can mean something completely different than the words composing them.
1.1.5. Con: "Freedom" is implied in "will", so ,"free" and "will" are at most, redundant, not oxymoronic.
1.1.5.1. Pro: “Free” and “will” are compatible if they apply to 2 different decisions for a single human. I choose “freely” A, then I “will” to choose B because of A. In this situation, I have free will even if my will is causal for some choices and I am free for some other choices.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Causality applied to decisions drives to consider : 1\) Most decisions have a cause 2\) There is at least 1 causeless “first” decision. “Free will” is the combination of 1 and 2.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: The rigorous acceptance in causality requires to think there was a "first cause", which cannot be explained by previous cause. This first cause concept is the limit to causality - therefore causality limits itself by definition.
1.1.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.5.1.2.1.2. Con: A "first cause" is only necessary if you conclude that time is of an objective shape such that it has a beginning and an end. It is possible that time is roughly cyclical or at least recursive.
1.1.5.1.2.1.2.1. Con: There are no evidence that time is not monodirectional.
1.1.5.1.2.1.2.2. Con: If time is cyclical, you need a cause to make time to exist, making it the first, but timeless, cause.
1.1.5.1.2.1.2.3. Con: Causality does not require time.
1.1.5.1.2.1.2.3.1. Pro: If you change the spin of an electron, you are clearly the cause of the change. If this electron is paired to another electron, making this other electron change its spin, the "first" electron is clearly the cause of the change of spin of the second one. However, the change of spin of this second electron is currently thought to be instantaneous, timeless. [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) Thus, causality does not require time.
1.1.5.2. Pro: "Free Will" is not an oxymoron. "Free" means "uninfluenced or unforced" while "will" means "exercise or choose my desired option". Hence, these two words have not opposite meanings to constitute an oxymoron.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Desires are simply internal influences. Therefore to claim that I make the choice of an option without any influence but "because I desire it" is self-contradictory, it is an oxymoron.
1.1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Human actions are determined by uncontrollable internal and metaphysical processes.
1.1.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Humans are bound by their personality, meaning they do not have the ability to truly choose freely.
1.1.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: We may not have control over inputs, but we do have control over outputs. The combination of nature and nurture and experience that created me in this moment is the array of possible information I could use to defeat any given task. The brain is capable of choosing between different choices based on an internal weighing of pros and cons.
1.1.5.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: Personality is a combination of nature and nurture, neither of which we have much control of during our upbringing.
1.1.5.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: While nature is derived biologically from your parents' DNA, nurture is dependent on your upbringing, culture and environment, none of which can be controlled.
1.1.5.2.1.1.1.3. Pro: "Man does at all times only what he wills, and yet he does this necessarily. But this is because he already is what he wills."— From Ch. V of Schopenhauer's essay [On the Freedom of the Will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Freedom_of_the_Will)
1.1.5.2.1.1.1.4. Con: Free will becomes possible when people become aware of all things that are entering their perception and unconsciously influencing on it.
1.1.5.2.1.1.1.5. Con: Humans are freely building their personality, not from the scratch, but on the foundation conditioned by inheritance, environment etc.
1.1.5.2.1.1.2. Pro: Humans are bound by [instinct](https://www.google.com/search?q=humans+and+instincts&oq=humans+and+instincts&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3j35i39l2.4431j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), which impinges on our ability to act freely.
1.1.5.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Free will is an alternative to instincts. Deciding what is favorable or not gives a choice to person with free will, to act accordingly or not. Humans are notorious for choosing less favorable options, like cigarettes.
1.1.5.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Desires are often described as the results of biological processes, such as hunger, tiredness, affective needs,  sexual attraction, addiction, etc
1.1.5.2.1.1.3. Pro: Human will is enslaved to the pursuit of pleasure. This is not freedom, but a bondage of the will.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: The pursuit of pleasure cannot be considered as freely willed since it is defined by each person’s individual and cultural perceptions which are, in turn, bound by unconscious desires.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.2. Pro: Because our drive for pleasure is [most often](https://www.inc.com/melissa-chu/why-your-brain-prioritizes-instant-gratification-o.html) for that which is immediate and not in a person’s best long-term interests, it leaves us settling for that which leaves us least happy. This cannot be considered free will, but truly bondage.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.2.1. Con: It is nevertheless possible to supersede the desire for instant gratification, showing it is not a constraint on our will but rather an obstacle that can be overcome through the will.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.3. Con: The simple exercise of suppressing an innate desire \(e.g. I am hungry, but still refuse the snacks in front of me\) supports the idea that there actually is free will. My body and internal processes are telling me, or even pulling me, in the direction of eating the snacks, yet I choose not to eat the snack.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.3.1. Pro: Suggesting that determinism would also favor choices which are not favorable for survival is a direct denial of a Darwinian evolution.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Darwinian evolution is not a process that produces perfect organisms. It is a statistical process that reduces the frequency of genes that tend to limit an organism's ability to reproduce. This does not preclude the capability of any individual to undergo random change.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: Darwinian evolution can produce empathic agents. The genes within a group of cooperating animals are at times more likely to proliferate when those animals cooperate as opposed to acting purely in self interest.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.3.1.3. Con: Unless food is sufficiently scarce, an animal’s not eating all it can every chance it gets does not necessarily put it at significant risk. Moreover, if food is plentiful enough and little effort is required to get it, an animal’s having certain inhibitions associated with eating could increase its chances of survival and procreation. Overeating can expose an animal to increased risks to its health.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.3.2. Con: Action and inaction are both decisions, both have an origin. While the mental origin is insulated by layers of abstraction it's still deterministic.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.3.3. Con: In such a scenario, one simply succumbs to the desire for control instead of for food.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.2.2.
1.1.5.2.1.1.3.5. Pro: The brain is forever in pursuit of substances like [dopamine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22875936) that form the main internal reward for things we do. The pursuit of dopamine is often the base for addiction to gambling, drugs, etc.
1.1.5.2.1.1.4. Pro: Our decisions and perceptions are inevitably shaped by our past experiences.
1.1.5.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: As Sartre said, 'Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you'. You can choose, but your options are already set by your past experiences.
1.1.5.2.1.1.4.2. Con: Past experiences play a big role in our decision making process but in a combination of free will, the freedom of giving more or less importance to these experiences and their outcomes.
1.1.5.2.1.1.4.3. Pro: Irrational fears, racism, sexism, etc. are not consciously decided things - they are generally placed in the unconscious or subconscious before they come to the fore.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5. Pro: Our thoughts and feelings create themselves, and we cannot directly affect what is thought or felt.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.1. Pro: Careful attention to the contents of consciousness reveals that thoughts and intentions simply arise in the mind, rather than being deliberately invented by a conscious self.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.1.1. Con: As long as consciousness is not fully understood \(such as the [binding problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_problem)\), it is difficult to determine to what extent we have control over our thoughts. Even if thoughts are largely mysterious, we seem to have some control over them.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.1.2. Con: If true, this claim cannot have been invented "deliberately", that is, it is not the product of careful consideration and deliberation of the evidence. It "simply \[arose\] in the mind". This destroys all warrant for any belief in this claim.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: This argument is applicable to each and every statement, causing an infinite regress which renders it meaningless.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: The truth of the rebutted claim is contingent on the truth of determinism. The infinite regress is avoided if a free agent can actually deliberate and consider arguments for a position. 

If, on the other hand, we cannot deliberate and consider arguments as free agents, the statement above the product of thoughts that simply arose in the mind, and cannot be considered meaningful.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.1.3. Pro: Given the confirmation of "[Wheeler's Delayed Choice](https://briankoberlein.com/2015/06/04/real-and-unreal/)," even down to the atomic level, things happen as they happen, with no room to alter the outcome.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.1.3.1. Con: It may be the case that consciousness is so fundamental that the modes of inquiry we choose to pay attention to influences the results of that inquiry. If we limit our inquiry to the behavior of 'atoms' observed as a consequence of marrying our perception of tangible and visible phenomena with a tangible and visible instrument's capacity for detecting the same, we may be erroneously dismissing our other capacities for perception of the intangible.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.1.4. Con: Thoughts and intentions can also me made to arise on demand.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.1.5. Con: It may be the case that our attention cannot exercise itself as both will and awareness of will at the same time. Just because will may be beyond our introspection does not mean that introspection ability is authoritative.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.2. Con: The entire practice of meditation or mindfulness is aimed at providing the practitioner with more control over their thoughts and feelings.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3. Pro: On a practical and experiential level creatures that do not comprehend all of the inputs to their own thinking process act and think \(and are better off acting and thinking\) as though there were free will -- so free will exists not as a fundamental truth but [as an heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness_Explained).
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: It is difficult to be aware of the determinants of the decision-making process, such as chemicals, hormones, feelings, value, consequences, and costs. Free will is merely our rationalization of this complex process.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.1.1. Con: The concept of mathematics is merely how we rationalize the behavior of observable phenomena. All constructs are an attempt to rationalize phenomena. This fact is independent from and logically neutral to the validity of the concepts themselves.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.1.2. Con: Our immediate inability to perceive the causes of events with our senses does not impede out ability to understand them in any other arena; While we cannot perceive the barometric changes and distant atmospheric conditions that cause a storm we nonetheless believe in their existence and reality.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.2. Pro: It is easy to a say that insects, or animals with limited brain capacities, have no free will and are acting on heredity and environment alone.  The fact that we have an evolved brain, with a consciousness observing our actions, makes us think our consciousness is the controlling agent; when we are simply a more aware animal.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.3. Pro: The illusion of free will is the phenomenological experience provided in the event that a future response to present sensory information has not yet been made conscious.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.4. Con: Whereas many stimuli influence our decisions, none can be described as being the final decision-maker. Only “me”, the subject, is the decision-maker.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.4.1. Con: The aggregation of "non-free" parts does not generate freedom.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.1.1.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.6. Con: Free will is necessarily used in the production of any claim about free will. If this were not the case then it would be like saying that a puppet could be stimulated in such a way that the wood would begin to rationalize it as free will.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.6.1. Pro: To say that something is rationalizing implies that there is some agency which has the power to act on its preferences. Something with no free will could not choose whether to believe in free will or not. Belief itself isn't really coherent without an assumption of agency with some degree of potential freedom.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.6.2. Con: The fear of the "rise of machines" is because we fear that intelligent robots, which are very complex puppets, may reach self-awareness and decide to take over, whereas they would still be non-free pre-determine & programmed machines.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.6.2.1. Con: The fear of a computer revolt may be completely irrational, borne out of a deterministic view of consciousness. If we are more than biological machines, then most of this fear is irrational and it would be just a circular argument to use this fear to defend determinism.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.4. Con: The following thought experiment proves that we have a large measure of control over our thoughts: visualize of an elephant. If you saw an elephant in your mind, congratulations. You have sucessfully controlled your thought. The same experiment can be repeated with any single person, place or thing you choose, ad infinitum.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.4.1. Con: However, that doesn't mean that we had any choice in the matter, it could be predetermined that I read the above claim, visualised an elephant and write this response.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.5. Con: Psychology suggests that we have the power to direct our thoughts and feelings.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.5.1. Pro: CBT is a fantastic framework to see this in action. As a result we can control / modify how we feel about certain things with mindfulness \(similar to meditation\) and logic.
1.1.5.2.1.1.5.5.2. Pro: We can similarly control our reactions to thoughts in general. PTSD recoverers are a good example of this.
1.1.5.2.1.1.6. Pro: Because decisions are often emotionally charged, one could say we play with loaded dice.
1.1.5.2.1.1.6.1. Con: This certainly seems to be the case and is the most reasonable statement we can honestly make on the subject; however, not knowing where free will starts and ends leaves it in question all together.
1.1.5.2.1.1.7. Con: It is not clear that human decision-making is bound by these influences, only that they are powerful influences. Free need not mean absolutely free at all times.
1.1.5.2.1.1.7.1. Con: Any decision-making or choice-making is based on information analysis, which involves conscious thinking. This isn't possible without external sources of influence and stimuli, making it clear, that we are fully bound by these stimuli.
1.1.5.2.1.1.7.1.1. Con: It doesn't follow that if we rely on sensory input from the external world to make a decision that we are acting in determined response to it.
1.1.5.2.1.1.7.1.1.1. Pro: One may look out the window, see that it is raining, yet still walk out without an umbrella.
1.1.5.2.1.1.7.1.2. Pro: Human thought is subject to a random physical environment.
1.1.5.2.1.1.7.1.2.1. Con: Self defeating. If this thought is produced solely by randomness, I have no warrant to believe it is true.
1.1.5.2.1.1.7.1.3. Con: This is a false statement. Some decisions are not made by information analysis.
1.1.5.2.1.1.7.1.3.1. Con: [Digital physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_physics)  and other information theories argues the opposite.
1.1.5.2.1.1.7.1.4. Con: One can make two or more different decisions in response to the same external sources and stimuli, thus it doesn't corroborate determinism.
1.1.5.2.1.1.7.2. Con: We are not capable of miraculously overriding what our entire biological structure — after all its contradicting opinions are aggregated — compels us to do. That people think we are capable of this is a reflection of our ignorance of the specifics about how all these mechanisms work.
1.1.5.2.1.1.7.3. Pro: When people overcome a physical addiction, that is evidence that we are capable of influencing our biochemical function and ultimately structure.
1.1.5.2.1.1.8. Pro: Desires can be contradictory. I desire to be on time to work but I desire to sleep longer this morning. We internally, consciously or not, weigh our desires to take a decision. The final decision is obviously the result of these influences and how intense they are, and can never be said to be uninfluenced.
1.1.5.2.1.1.9. Con: Free will is defined as the "ability to act at one's own discretion".  The fact that we, as humans, are controlled biologically by our internal parts/processes does not show that we, as humans, are not the one in control, because we are the sum of our parts.
1.1.5.2.1.1.9.1. Con: The internal processes which control all of our "parts" \(cells, physiological processes, ...\) all answer deterministic rules \(described through physics, chemistry and biology\). Arguing that we are the sum of these parts therefore seems to confirm that the human behavior is deterministic as well, and that there is no such thing as free will.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: 'Option' as well, reconstructs this argument, as it is of the available options that once must choose from. This choice, based on past experience, dictates the outcome.
1.1.5.3. Con: Freedom is not implied in will. One can have the will to move but be bound by chains.
1.1.6. Pro: This is argued by John Locke in his “Essay”, book 2, chapter 21, section 16.

"Plainly the will is simply one power or ability, and freedom is another; so that to ask whether the will has freedom is to ask whether one power has another power... For anyone can see that powers belong only to agents, and are attributes only of substances, and not of powers themselves! So that the question ‘Is the will free?’ contains the question ‘Is the will a substance, an agent?"
1.2. Con: There are various religious and spiritual teachings that imply we have free will.
1.2.1. Pro: JudeoChristian Scriptures teach that God has given us the freedom to choose our actions.
1.2.1.1. Pro: The Old Testament states: "choose you this day whom ye will serve." - Joshua 24:15
1.2.1.2. Pro: The Old Testament teaches: "I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live." [Deuteronomy 30:19](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Deuteronomy-30-19/)
1.2.1.3. Pro: The Book of Mormon teaches: "men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil." [2 Nephi 2:27](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27?lang=eng#p26)
1.2.1.4. Con: The existence of God itself is an intense debate in and of itself, with no consensus even on its nature.
1.2.2. Pro: The Hindu faith teaches that though we do not choose the circumstances we are now in and the karma that will result from our choices, [we are free to choose our actions](http://The Hindu faith teaches that though we do not choose the circumstances we are now in and the karma that will result from our choices, we are free to choose our actions.).
1.2.3. Pro: Though Muslims believe in divine destiny, that all that will happen is written on the preserved tablet, Allah's awareness of what will happen does not force mankind's hand. [Mankind has free will](https://thedebateinitiative.com/2014/11/20/the-concept-of-free-will-in-islam/).
1.2.4. Pro: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \(The "Mormon" Church\) teaches that free will, or "Agency," is essential the God's plan of Happiness for mankind and [our freedom to choose is one of mankind's greatest blessings.](https://www.lds.org/topics/agency?lang=eng)
1.2.4.1. Pro: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also teaches that one of Satan's greatest sins was that he ["sought to destroy the agency \[i.e. free will\] of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him."](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.3-4)
1.2.4.2. Con: There's no logic or rational thinking into your claim other than implicit authority. It'd be the same as claiming that Harry Potter teaches us that free will or "Agency" is an illusion on page 137. If you don't take Harry Potter as an authority this claim means nothing to you. That's why we have science and logic to support any explanation without implicit authority.
1.2.5. Con: The existence of a God or deity precludes or inhibits free will.
1.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.4.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Free will is not free will if endowed, in such a case it can only be conditional, the condition being that the endowing being does not take it away.
1.2.5.3. Con: The existence of god itself can be a masqueraded implication of free will, as it can be used as an excuse for our actions. \("This is god's will", "I am doing the lord's work" etc.\)
1.2.5.4. Con: Many feelings of God \(grieving, hope, anger, etc.\) depicted in some religions are possible only if he lacks control over human decisions, which means that these are free from God.
1.2.5.5. Pro: Islam undermines belief in the existence of free will.
1.2.5.5.1. Pro: Islam \(like many religions\) contains the concept of \([qadar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination_in_Islam)\), which is incompatible with free will.
1.2.5.5.1.1. Con: The way I read it, qadar is about events as opposed to personal choice of action.
1.2.5.6. Con: God \(as recognized by the three main monotheistic religions\) is a being of an incomprehensible nature. To presume an an understanding of how its knowledge and understanding operates is foolishness.
1.2.5.7. Con: Free will should not exist because it is precluded by God's existence. That being said, God decided to give us free will by his own power.
1.2.5.7.1. Pro: By giving men the ability not to give in to their own natural desire, God has made them free.
1.2.5.7.1.1. Pro: Free will is restrained by sin
1.2.5.7.1.1.1. Con: Christ granted us free will when he died for our sins that would have otherwise prevented us from being able to be free.
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.1. Con: Freewill is given by the Creator, not the creature
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.2. Con: Jews and all non-christian people are not lacking anything that christian people have, including freedom.
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Christ claimed that he would die for all human beings \([John 12.20,32,33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+12.20%2C32%2C33&version=NIV)\)
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Christs' disciples claimed he died for all the world \([1 John 2.2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2.2&version=NIV)\).
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.2.3. Pro: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." John 3:16
Only people that believe in Jesus can benefit from his death. Many people don't believe, but are not lacking free will.
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.2.3.1. Con: Having eternal life and having free will are fundamentally, functionally, and metaphorically different.
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.3. Con: Sins are not universally acknowledged to exist.
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.4. Con: Some Christians assert that Christ is still alive. The death that this statement requires may be of an impermanent nature. Therefore the freedom granted may be likewise temporary or tenuous.
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Death, by definition is of permanent nature, and the defying of that death with the resurrection and with the eternal life that Christ supposedly has does not change the permanent nature of dying for sins on the cross.
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: If I permanently broke a steel pipe in half on someone's head, and then permanently welded it back together, the mending of the pipe does not undo the damage it caused, nor the effect on the pipe.
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.5. Con: It seems unlikely that men were not capable of free will before the death of Christ.
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.5.1. Con: There is no "before" the spiritual sacrifice of Christ according to some bible verses.
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Christ is the "lamb of God" \([John 1.29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1.29&version=KJV)\) that was "slain before the foundation of the world" \([Revelation 13.8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A8&version=KJV)\)
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.5.1.2. Pro: The forgiveness through Christ sacrifice was given to men before the time itself was created ! \([2 Tim 1.9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Tim+1.9&version=ISV)\)
1.2.5.7.1.1.1.6. Pro: For an omnipotent being to demonstrate that he grants free will requires an extraordinary display of his submission to others' choices
1.2.5.7.1.1.2. Con: Freedom is restrained by original sin, not Freewill.
1.2.5.7.1.1.2.1. Pro: People are not Free to do the "Gods Will" because they are restrained by the original sin. But they all have Freewill to keep being slaves or to free themselves.
1.2.5.7.1.1.3. Pro: Because free will is the mechanism by which many believe they avoid sin and culpability, they are terrified to imagine that there may be no free will, for fear of damnation; and so they are strongly compelled to believe they are in control of their actions.  This discredits the rationality of believing in free will among those who believe in sin in a way that suggests it is out of fear, rather than logic or evidence.
1.2.5.7.1.1.4. Pro: People are still subject to original sin and so cannot be free.
1.2.5.7.1.1.4.1. Con: Freedom and Freewill are two different things.
1.2.5.7.1.1.5. Pro: The Bible claims that all human beings are "slaves to sin" \(Romans 6:15-23\), and--until freed by God--their will is constrained to sin. Once freed, and while here on earth, humankind will still struggle to do what pleases God because of sin in their flesh \(Romans 7:13-25\).
1.2.5.7.1.1.5.1. Con: However, sinful behaviors can be overcome through [reliance on Christ](http://crowncovenantchurch.org/confessions/WestminsterCOF.aspx?QuestionID=9&pageid=0&confession=true&q=Chapter+9+-+Of+Free+Will.) \(2 Peter 1:3\).
1.2.5.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.2.5.7.3. Con: God can't give us free will if we didn't have the choice to exist in the first place. You can't give free will, if so, it's no longer free will because there's no choice to accept or decline it. It becomes an imposition.
1.2.5.7.3.1. Con: Free will does not require the freedom to have it.
1.2.5.7.3.1.1. Pro: Being free between doing good and doing evil does not mean being free between being alive and being dead.
1.2.5.7.3.1.1.1. Con: Free will is not omnipotence \(deciding when to die, etc\). Free will refers to making decisions on your own, not overthrowing the laws of nature.
1.2.5.7.3.1.2. Pro: Being free between being happy or sad does not mean being free to have a mood or not, in a similar way that having a free will does not mean to be free to have free will.
1.2.5.7.3.1.3. Pro: Freedom is not omnipotence. Having a will that has freedom \(= free will\) does not mean that my will can obtain anything, possible or not - that is omnipotence of the will, not freedom of the will, not free will.
1.2.5.7.3.2. Con: Someone who does not exist cannot choose to exist.
1.2.5.7.4. Con: If God was the source of free will, then as a benevolent deity God would not limit our freedom. If our freedom were not divinely limited, we would have access to godly abilities, like to form planets, create angels, and animals. Since we cannot do those things, a benevolent god cannot be the source of our free will.
1.2.5.7.4.1. Con: Humans not having the power of a God does not mean that they are limited in free will.
1.2.5.7.4.2. Con: Free will is naturally limited to performing things that physical objects can do, we can life a rock, but not a boulder, just as a monkey could do before us.
1.2.5.7.4.3. Con: Having godlike abilities is not necessarily in the best interest of humans, so a benevolent God might have reason not to bestow godlike abilities on humans.
1.2.5.7.4.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.7.3.1.3.
1.2.5.7.5. Con: "God giving free will" has not been observed in the first person by any living person.
1.2.5.7.5.1. Con: The Bible states that beings witnessed the scenes of the creation of our world \([Job 38.1-7](https://www.bible.com/fr/bible/111/JOB.38.1-7.niv)\) - they include the famous free human choice to eat the forbidden fruit \([Genesis 2.10,16-17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+2.9%2C16-17&version=NKJV)\).
1.2.5.7.5.2. Con: "Free will" being a concept, its gift cannot be observed directly.
1.2.5.7.5.3. Con: Providing an authoritative document as evidence for a fact is accepted in most situations.
1.2.5.7.5.3.1. Pro: The peer-reviewed opinion of well-read scientists is considered as evidence in research.
1.2.5.7.5.3.2. Pro: Some book-based religions have documents \(their sacred books and their comments\) to claim that "God gave free will" to mankind.
1.2.5.7.5.3.3. Pro: To prove that I have kids, I do not need to show my kids physically, but legal documents with their names.
1.2.5.7.5.3.4. Pro: To prove that I have a car, I don't need to show the car or certificate that nobody ever stole it/wreck it, but just legal documents that I bought one/rent one. Similarly, if I have proof that I received free will \(from God\), I do not need any proof that it was not taken away.
1.2.5.8. Pro: God's omniscience regarding our "choices" may mean that a classical God cannot give us freewill.
1.2.5.8.1. Con: According to the Christian God, you are free to choose between certain paths. When He says you are predestined he actually tells you that the path you chose will get you to a particular destination.
1.2.5.8.1.1. Con: No such precise description is given in the bible
1.2.5.8.2. Pro: God's purported omnipotence and omnipresence would necessarily dictate that all choices would proceed according to God's will, not ours.
1.2.5.8.2.1. Con: If God is truly omnipotent, then he must have the ability to give us free will. Omnipotence necessitates to have the ability to create logic and make it bend to His will to give us free will.
1.2.5.8.2.2. Con: The impact of God omnipotence and omniscience on human free will depends on the content of his will, not just its existence.
1.2.5.8.2.2.1. Pro: It is possible to posit a type of non-classical God who willingly blinds himself to our choices such that He provides us freewill.
1.2.5.8.2.2.1.1. Con: The definition of God given for this discussion includes omniscience. For God to know everything, but not know everything at the same time in the same way is incoherent.
1.2.5.8.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Not knowing a fact by becoming "willfully blind" to that fact is not "the same way" as not knowing a fact. Therefore the contradiction is avoided.
1.2.5.8.2.2.1.2. Pro: In Christianity, Jesus plainly said that He did not know when He would return; only the Father knew that date. \(Matthew 24:36\) Most Christians hold that Jesus as God knew this information, but willingly blinded himself to it while walking the earth as a human.
1.2.5.8.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Although the claim above is accurate, it addresses a specific bit of knowledge. The Bible never implies that God is unaware of our future actions and choices.
1.2.5.8.2.2.2. Pro: A omniscient God that would "not care" would have a neutral will about mankind, meaning that it would have no impact on the existence of free will.
1.2.5.8.2.2.3. Pro: God could consider "free will" as more important than its domination over the universe, making himself a willing "victim" of the free choices made in the universe.
1.2.5.8.2.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.7.1.1.1.
1.2.5.8.2.2.3.2. Pro: If "God is love" he would choose "love" as more important than power, life, or any moral value. Since love requires freedom, he would grant free will, even over his dead body
1.2.5.8.2.2.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.7.1.1.1.
1.2.5.8.2.2.3.2.2. Pro: Do "not stir up or awaken love
    until it pleases" [Song of Songs 2.7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Songs+2.7&version=ESV) \(Bible\)
1.2.5.8.2.2.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.7.1.1.1.6.
1.2.5.8.2.3. Con: The concept of a God that is watching and judging would imply that he has given free will
1.2.5.8.3. Con: Omniscience about your choices doesn't have bearing on whether you have free will.  \(Omniscience about what you will chose does not imply a constraint on your freedom to choose.\)
1.2.5.8.3.1. Con: An Omnisciencent being who can see the future, contradicts freewill as it requires a predetermined future to exist.
1.2.5.8.3.1.1. Con: If there is an infinite number of possible outcomes out of a single action, there is not a single predetermined future, but an infinte number of possible futures. Thus, on Omnisciencent being can know \(can "will"\) all of them, without constraining your choice.
1.2.5.8.3.1.2. Con: A predetermined future doesn't contradict free will
1.2.5.8.3.1.2.1. Pro: The future, even if it was determined in advance can be “due to” the free choices that will be made by the agents involved. The “future” aspect of a cause may not preclude its validity as a cause.
1.2.5.8.3.1.2.2. Pro: Predetermined meaning also “perceived in advance” in the context of the omniscience of the future, must not be confused with the deterministic view of the world in which things are prepared/set in advance by fate - these are homonyms but not synonymous. The fact that I know something does not mean that I cause it.
1.2.5.8.3.1.3. Con: There is no reason to assume that a god's ability to predict the future would necessitate a pre-determined future, as omnipotence entails yet unknown \(or even impossible\) ways of knowing.
1.2.5.8.3.1.3.1. Con: If a god could predict it accurately enough for them to be correct every time, then the future would have to be predetermined otherwise the god would have nothing to base their predictions on.
1.2.5.8.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.8.2.2.1.
1.2.5.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.8.3.1.
1.2.5.8.6. Con: If God is not situated in time, but external to it, he can know our future without depriving us from free will.
1.2.5.8.6.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.8.3.1.
1.2.5.9. Pro: Assuming there is a god, such as the Christian God, He himself restricts that "free" will by saying "you will not kill".
1.2.5.9.1. Con: That doesn't disprove free-will. God may say it's wrong but that doesn't mean no choice - this is just more evidence for free-will. I can suggest to my child that he doesn't drink alcohol, but he still has the will to choose.
1.2.5.9.2. Con: People can kill independent of divine edicts, proving that they have free will even though God may not a particular thing to happen.
1.2.5.9.3. Con: The Monotheistic God does not force its commandments unto mankind - that is their definition of God's-given free will.
1.2.5.9.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.8.1.
1.2.5.10. Con: This may be an argument against particular concepts of God or fate rather than an argument against free will.
1.2.5.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.8.2.2.1.
1.2.5.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.
1.2.5.10.3. Pro: The choice of a specific God is arbitrary and their bearing on any argument predicated on sharing beliefs.
1.2.5.10.3.1. Pro: Some gods are said to have given free will to some people, but other gods have not purportedly given free will.
1.2.5.10.3.2. Con: Monotheistic theologies tend to explain their philosophical and historical claims, even the actions & existence of God, out of necessity/reasoning and not out of unfalsifiable stories and statements as ancient or modern mythologies would.
1.2.5.10.3.2.1. Pro: Explaining logic through stories is in no way inherently logical or sensible. A story may facilitate understanding, but does not impact the truth or reality of a fact. Buttressing statements with claims from fictional characters does nothing to strengthen a claim.
1.2.5.10.4. Con: -> See 1.2.5.10.3.2.
1.2.5.11. Con: Since Deities are considered to have free will, eventually free will exists, even if humans do not have any.
1.2.5.12. Con: With no free will, you can't believe in God because such a belief entails freedom. Therefore, belief in God and unbelief in free will are not compatible.
1.2.5.12.1. Pro: Belief itself isn't really coherent without an assumption of agency with some degree of potential freedom.
1.2.6. Pro: In most religions God gave commandments, not simple orders, because he expects men to choose to follow them, not just automatically do like machines.
1.2.7. Pro: God wants humans to be morally good, and the only way that we can be morally good is if we have free will.
1.2.7.1. Con: Most people don't believe animals have free will yet we often punish or reward animals according to their behaviour \(E.g, dogs\), so clearly, it is not necessary. Your dog can do something 'bad' even though it doesn't freely choose it in the libertarian sense.
1.2.7.2. Con: To argue based on what God wants, we must first prove that a god exists, then prove what that god wants.
1.2.7.3. Pro: God's judgement in many religions require people to have chosen evil to "deserve" any kind of punishment
1.2.7.4. Pro: God's reward to obedient human beings require obedience to be freely chosen for this reward to be moral.
1.2.7.5. Pro: If we did not have free will we would be unmoral.
1.2.7.5.1. Pro: Things can only be moral if they have the choice to be moral. Morality is a crucial concept for the proper functioning of human societies.
1.2.7.5.1.1. Pro: Entities without agency cannot be held accountable.
1.2.7.5.1.1.1. Pro: A tornado is not immoral for destroying a family.
1.2.7.5.1.1.2. Pro: A tree is not morally good for bearing fruit.
1.2.7.5.1.1.3. Pro: A rock is not immoral for rolling down a hill.
1.2.7.5.1.1.4. Pro: I do not praise my heater for its morality whereas it protects me from having a cold. A predetermined mechanism cannot be considered moral neither immoral, but amoral.
1.2.7.5.1.2. Con: An intentional actor is not necessarily a free one. A person who intends to murder another may not be free -- either because determinism is true or because they have an organic brain condition -- and yet a murder underpinned by the intention to murder is still immoral \(for its intentional impact on wellbeing\).
1.2.7.5.1.2.1. Con: A person with an organic brain condition murdering is immoral because a person has a responsibility to handle their mental faculties.
1.2.7.5.1.2.1.1. Pro: [Meditation](https://hbr.org/2015/01/mindfulness-can-literally-change-your-brain) can change people's brains.
1.2.7.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: [Pain medication](https://psychcentral.com/news/2013/11/20/pain-medication-causes-significant-brain-changes/62294.html) can change people's brains.
1.2.7.5.1.2.1.3. Pro: [Therapy changes](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170117101436.htm) the brain.
1.2.7.6. Pro: God is conceived of as a benevolent being, meaning He wants to make good things happen.
1.2.8. Con: In a purely, scientific, rational discussion surrounding what is assumed to be a neurological phenomenon, spiritual and religious teachings have no addition to coming closer to a scientific truth, nor do they present a good tool to get closer to this scientific, irrefutable truth.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Religious and spiritual teaching may be wrong. It's the same as someone claiming Math and Biology teaching says there's no free will.
1.2.8.1.1. Pro: Religious teachings are generally not exercises in rational critical thinking and often specifically ask those being taught to disregard their critical thinking toolset in favour of unquestioning faith.
1.2.8.2. Con: By definition, scientific truth cannot be irrefutable, since scientific truth must be [refutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability) to be considered scientific.
1.2.8.2.1. Con: In practice, science requires that any proposition should merely be subject to repeatable verification.
1.2.8.3. Con: In the domain we examine as appropriate to a discussion of free will, both the objective neurological foundations of the phenomena \(read biology\) AND metaphysics are necessary for a robust and informed discussion. We will necessarily have recourse to speaking in terms of the extra-physical when discussing such extra-physical concepts as thought and choice.
1.2.8.4. Con: The limits of current science exploring the structural basis for consciousness fall short of explanation of the topic; thus if we were to  restrict our conversation to purely scientific description of the topic we ought only to say that we don't know.
1.2.8.4.1. Con: We also don't know what pulls us to Earth. Nonetheless we accept the Theory of Gravity. There are studies proving we experience consciousness fractions of seconds after the decision was made \(see link [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080411/full/news.2008.751.html) \) among others studies supporting free will is an illusion - thus ,as of now, for all purposes there is gravity and there is not free will.
1.2.9. Con: This is reverse reasoning. Free will would be an argument for those religions but those religions aren't an argument for free will.
1.2.10. Con: Some religious thinkers reject the concept of free will, such as Martin Luther in ["On The Bondage of the Will."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Bondage_of_the_Will)
1.2.11. Con: Religious and spiritual teachings on free will offer no means to test their veracity or question the source and so should be treated with no more regard than any other anecdote.
1.2.11.1. Pro: Various religions are known to be inconsistent with reality.
1.2.11.1.1. Pro: Christianity and Judaism include the claim that God created Eve after Adam already existed \(and had even named things\), which is contradicted by anthropology and evolution that show that genders existed before humans and that humans evolved male and female along side each other from other species.
1.2.11.1.2. Con: One from the opposite perspective could claim that various branches of science are known to be inconsistent with reality.
1.2.12. Con: No religion was ever proved to be true.
1.2.12.1. Con: It is impossible to prove any statement. Religion is not unique in this aspect.
1.3. Pro: Human actions and choices can be traced back to deterministic causes.
1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.7.1.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.
1.3.3. Pro: Humans actions are determined by cause and effect of the physical world.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Biological discoveries have been made that explain many internal sources of influence that deterministically determine human action.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Research on the gut microbiome seems to indicate that the bacteria in your gut drive your food choices.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Different bacteria in the gut have different nutritional requirements. They emit signaling molecules. Because the gut is linked to the immune system, the endocrine system and the nervous system the signals have the capability of directly affecting behavior.  This means that what you call free will may just be some bacteria in your gut or other part of your body that has a requirement.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: If 'many internal sources of influence' determine human actions, it does not follow that these influences cause human action necessarily rather than contingently.
1.3.3.1.3. Con: Sources of influence that are internal to me are part of me and thus expressions of my free will. You can't say I don't have free will and at the same time agree that the locus of decision is internal to me because that admits the existence of free will.
1.3.3.1.4. Con: "Many" is not all, and inherently indicates a quantity of unknown. This unknown quantity, by it's existence, precludes using the incomplete known quantity as evidence for the nonexistence of a biological basis for free will
1.3.3.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.3.3.1.5. Pro: Your DNA makes your decisions in the subconscious. You are just not aware of it.
1.3.3.1.5.1. Con: Introducing this as an argument for the existence of free will implies that free will can be found at the level of DNA, i.e. genetic material is somehow free to choose how it is expressed. There is no evidence that this is the case.
1.3.3.1.5.1.1. Con: The assumption is that the starting point of a behaviour or making a choice, is a thought. Maybe thoughts are the end result of biological stimulus like "body is low on energy" and you think "hungry". Why would "free will" be any different?
1.3.3.1.5.1.1.1. Con: The Hard Problem of Consciousness is to find any justification for thoughts and experiences in the first place. If the body is low on energy, then the body would simply prioritize food-seeking behavior. The existence of hunger experience is a phenomenon which only makes sense if there is an agent with the freedom to act willfully that can choose how to respond to it.
1.3.3.1.5.1.2. Con: This may be begging the question, since there may be no way for free will to make itself 'evidence' from a third party perspective. Looking at traffic patterns of a city from an aerial view, there is no evidence of drivers or the role that their intention plays in determining the behavior of vehicles.
1.3.3.1.5.2. Con: While thoughts change over the entire lifetime, DNA doesn't. Thus DNA can't be the root cause of thoughts.
1.3.3.1.5.2.1. Con: Maybe our understanding of genes are insufficient. DNA can change. On a micro level e.g., they change as we age.[DNA determinism might be wrong](https://www.naturalnews.com/042157_DNA_transformation_science_epigenetics.html) [DNA change in adulthood](https://www.quora.com/Can-the-DNA-change-functionally-during-a-lifetime) [This is why chemotherapy works](http://www.wisegeek.org/can-your-dna-change-during-your-life.htm)
1.3.3.1.5.2.2. Con: DNA has tertiary and quaternary structures which do change, and those changes have been associated epigenetic effects.
1.3.3.1.5.2.3. Con: DNA, without changing, codes for the development of the embryo, puberty, and other life events through complex step-by-step coding system. If our DNA is able to code cellular decisions one by one, may be also human decisions.
1.3.3.1.5.2.3.1. Con: There are no cellular decisions.
1.3.3.1.5.2.3.1.1. Con: Since deciding can be defined as the [selection of a course of action](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/decide), the centralized and complex mechanisms of selection of a course of actions during cellular differentiation can be described as a cellular decision process.
1.3.3.1.5.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Cells do not select.
1.3.3.1.5.2.3.2. Con: Some parts of the body may still grow after death; bodily mechanics continue to work automatically. This means some DNA is still active postmortem. If DNA was the source of consciousness, there would be some consciousness remaining postmortem. DNA is the information, it is not the source of information. Exactly the opposite conclusion follows: DNA is determined by consciousness, not the other way around.
1.3.3.1.5.2.3.2.1. Con: There is no proof of absence of consciousness post-mortem, but only absence of communication.
1.3.3.1.5.2.3.2.1.1. Con: There is a proof of brain activity being zero a.k.a. "flat line".
1.3.3.1.5.2.3.2.2. Con: If DNA is determined by consciousness, you would be conscious before the making of your DNA, which is the fecondation of the ovocyte of your mother. Such pre-existing consciousness is not commonly observed.
1.3.3.1.5.2.3.2.2.1. Con: Consciousness of the parents, of course.
1.3.3.1.5.2.3.3. Con: Biology teaches that DNA is a blueprint for hardware \(proteins\) only, not software \(mind\). So far no hardware ever produced software.
1.3.3.1.5.2.3.4. Con: DNA is not coding cellular decisions, it *determines* the actions of cells.
1.3.3.1.5.3. Pro: If my decisions are biologically predetermined, it can rightfully be considered as my own decisions. Indeed, my body's unconscious processes can be rightfully described as part of my person.
1.3.3.1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.5.2.3.
1.3.3.1.6. Con: It is a faulty generalization \([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faulty_generalization)\) to say that all actions are biologically influenced because many are.
1.3.3.2. Pro: There is nothing in humans which has been confirmed to exist except by physics.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: Physics does not study metaphysics by definition. Therefore physicists have not searched for metaphysical objects, which explains why they have not found any.
1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: The rigorous test of the existence of "free will" require to consider the possibility of a supernatural, metaphysical or non-natural cause for human decisions. Thus, to avoid supernatural arguments for the existence of free will quenches any debate on free will.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Concepts such as supernatural or not-natural are meaningless. Either something exists or it does not exist. For example, fairies are not supernatural, they just don't exist.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Supernatural is the best concept to describe something that exists but whose description require to acknowledge greater abilities than the limits we think material things have.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: A plane would be supernatural for a regular person living 5 hundred years ago.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Technically, no. 500 years ago, there existed objects heavier than air that flew.
500 years ago, plane could have been characterized as "weird". But, if using precise language - certaintly not "supernatural".
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that an object exist should not have any bearing on its supernatural state, unless supernatural is limited a priori to fiction.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.1.2. Con: We should not consider the possibility that our solar system was created by two black holes colliding. 
Or that a giant asteroid exploded and gave birth to our sun and planets.
These would be supernatural / not-natural explanations. We should not consider those. Explanations are either plausible or not. They must not ever assume something that we have never observed in nature. Otherwise we have exactly infinite possible explanations.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: A sun might come out of two black holes colliding. But:
1/ we have never observed that. 
2/ our current model of physics does not predict that this is possible
These two points are all that is required to rule out this possibility.
We should not consider this kind of "suppernatural".
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: To formulate a new model of a specific scientific field that would be relevant it requires to 
1\) have a different interpretation of the observations made so far and
2\) have some new experiments to conduct that would not be better explained by the previous model.
Since colliding 2 black holes is not possible as an experiment, a simple observation would suffice to validate the 2nd point.
But to prevent any formulation of a new model because it is "currently supernatural" is not proper science.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Proper scientific research require to test hypotheses that are not currently obvious from observation. If it were only about testing hypotheses on events that are already observed and obvious, there would be no new experiment required.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Not natural is a broad concept, including  non-obvious, artificial  and non-described. Things that exist or not can be rightfully described as not-natural.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.3. Con: The verification principle deals only in the domain of materialism, and the original claim is regarding a proposed feature of consciousness. As consciousness itself is a meaningless concept by the yardstick of the verification principle, it is not an effective tool for discovery on the topic.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.3.1. Con: If conscience is deterministic, there should be evidence of processes that lead to decisions in that process, such as the chemical processes that go on in the brain.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.4. Con: There are discrepancies in the "exists/doesn't exist" dichotomy proposed. Our physics paradigm is incomplete, and there are concepts that are mathematically necessary to our understanding of the universe that nonetheless cannot be verified by observation. Dark matter is one such concept.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.4.1. Con: There is a difference between evidence pointing to something that we currently don't understand \(such as dark matter\) and stuff that there is no evidence for \(faeries\)
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.4.2. Con: Dark matter is verified by observation \(observation of galaxy clusters and of general gravitational patterns\), just not by direct observation \(of dark matter - whatever dark matter truly is\).
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: Dark matter has been discovered by updated models of space distribution. This observation presents the opportunity for dark matter to exist. With near certainty we can prove this, sadly we have not created the proper technology required to directly observe this.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.5. Pro: According to Tim Minchin [storm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U) "Throughout history, every mystery ever solved has turned out to be NOT magic."
Once something is understood, it becomes part of science.
1.3.3.2.1.1.1.6. Con: Supernatural things exist as a plot device in fiction literature.
1.3.3.2.1.1.2. Pro: If there is a natural cause to your will, it is not "free"
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: Due to the fact that we are seemingly bound to laws that govern over energy and particles, our past can be perceived and thus we can explain basically any choice made in the past. This implies that our choices in the present are also predetermined.
1.3.3.2.3. Con: Just because free will is imperceivable in the physical world does not mean it does not exist.
1.3.3.2.4. Con: Scientists who study physics do however acknowledge the necessity of forces and materials which are not understood or observable in the common sense of the word.
1.3.3.2.4.1. Pro: Physicists theorize and search for a [fifth elemental force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_force)\(to add to gravity, strong force, weak force, and electromagnetism\).
1.3.3.2.4.2. Pro: [Dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) is a term applied to the missing mass that physicists calculate should exist given our most current models.
1.3.3.2.4.3. Pro: Material is a term that is at best only figuratively applied to things at the quantum level. Electrons do not properly exist in a location; they do when observed, but otherwise are a field of probable locations. [ed.ted.com](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-uncertain-location-of-electrons-george-zaidan-and-charles-morton#review)
1.3.3.2.5. Con: Physic is not the only science that can confirm the existence of things.
1.3.3.2.6. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.1.1.4.
1.3.3.3. Con: Phenomena that are native to a high level of abstraction can be very difficult or practically impossible to see at a lower level.
1.3.3.3.1. Pro: If you go to the Whitehouse and want to meet the government, you will only meet representatives of the government. You will never meet The Government, yet The Government does exist.
1.3.3.3.2. Pro: Analyzing trees in great detail would show no obvious signs of forests. Similarly, free will is ultimately a result of physical brain functions but it may be practically impossible for us to see or comprehend it at that level.
1.3.3.3.3. Pro: Stoicism is very popular in our world climate. It teaches you to acknowledge what you, as an individual, can change and what you can't. It sounds like a great philosophy \(and is\), until an elderly gentleman told me: "What Stoics don't understand, is that if you stand together, you can change the unchangeable."
1.3.3.3.4. Pro: 'Chairs' and 'atoms' exist on different levels of abstraction but it's not useful to say that, on the atomic level, chairs don't exist. To say so would deny the real, atomic level physical correlate which the concept of 'chairs' attempts to describe.
1.3.3.3.4.1. Con: It would be entirely accurate to state that chairs do not exist on the atomic level; it would in fact be the only reasonable expression one could make with respect to the question. To say otherwise would be absurd.
1.3.3.3.5. Pro: Science cannot locate consciousness whereas it is essential to the concept of free will.
1.3.3.3.6. Pro: "... we are only just beginning to understand the foundations of human intelligence and consciousness that cannot be captured in an algorithmic formula divorced from the functions of the body and the long evolution of our species and its microbiome." [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/03/02/human-machine/?utm_term=.acb4c26dadcd)
1.3.3.4. Con: Thought and consciousness exist in humans, and are immaterial; as such not subject to physical laws.
1.3.3.4.1. Pro: Thoughts do not accelerate towards Earth under gravitational attraction until they reach terminal velocity, for example.
1.3.3.4.2. Pro: While free will might not exist in the sense of laws of physics or deterministic universe, it does exist in the sense of psychology and sociology.
1.3.3.4.3. Pro: We don't know what is determining our physical brain states.
1.3.3.4.3.1. Pro: Brain functions do not reflect the sense of self. This sense is not physical and can not be seen from the outside of the self.
1.3.3.4.3.2. Con: The rebuttal that can be generalised to 'even if a phenomenon can be reduced to natural explanations, there could be a magical cause underlying it' are impotent rebuttals. This is because they simply assert the possibility of supernatural causes.
1.3.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: If there is a natural explanation of decisions, a 'will' or 'agent' that can transcend natural explanations is unnecessary.
Such [natural explanations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18408715) do exist.
1.3.3.4.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.1.
1.3.3.4.3.3. Pro: There could also be emergent properties within the grouping of neurons themselves that bring about a non-mental consciousness that controls free will. So really, free will isn't some material, but rather an outcome from the complexity of our neural connections.
1.3.3.4.3.4. Pro: Our spirit may be determining, freely, our physical brain states.
1.3.3.4.4. Con: Whether they are physical or not, the process by which thoughts evolve is either deterministic or random.
1.3.3.5. Pro: Modern science's understanding of the brain suggests it is deterministically linked to human action.
1.3.3.5.1. Con: Brain science is still in a relatively crude stage even after great advancements in the last few decades.
1.3.3.5.1.1. Pro: Modelling even single neurons in a realistic manner requires modern supercomputers, therefore there is not enough processing power in the world to simulate the billions of neurons in the entire brain.
1.3.3.5.1.2. Con: All scientific fields are in a relatively crude state compared to future advancements, but we can still construct current consensus based on current science.
1.3.3.5.1.2.1. Con: Consensus does not mean truth but theory. When it gets to "free will", there is an impossibility to disprove or prove it by using only current scientific consensus, since we are not having a consensus on spirit, consciousness and soul definitions.
1.3.3.5.1.3. Pro: Currently, the way that brains process information and make decisions is far beyond our understanding, thus the data required to disprove free will cannot currently be processed.
1.3.3.5.1.3.1. Con: Understanding the biological working of the brain is an arbitrary goal post. The question of free will can be tackled deductively without any knowledge of how this particular process unfolds.
1.3.3.5.1.3.2. Pro: If in the unkown part of the decision-making process there is a decisive free-willed element, free will exist and we simply do not know it yet.
1.3.3.5.1.3.3. Pro: Whereas correlations can be found in brain physical patterns before the actual decision, since the processes that lead to these patterns are mostly  unknwon it leaves plenty of room for freely willed conscious elements.
1.3.3.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.4.3.1.
1.3.3.5.3. Pro: [Brain scans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esPRsT-lmw8) show that organic aspects of brain function affect decisions and behavior.
1.3.3.5.4. Pro: Criminology shows that brain activity and deficiency can contribute to criminal activity.
1.3.3.5.5. Con: -> See 1.3.3.3.
1.3.3.5.6. Pro: Multiple substances seem to be able to change a person completely in a few seconds under their influence, which goes to show that its likely our behavior and our personality can be fully changed under the influence of various chemicals.   there is no reason to assume that our actions are governed by anything other then chemicals in our brain.
1.3.3.5.7. Pro: In order for free will to exist, some physical aspect of the brain would require the ability to move without being moved. This is physically impossible.
1.3.3.5.8. Con: Neuroplasticity suggests that the "individual" and their choices shape the physical structure of the brain. For example, when you learn to play the guitar you make physical changes to your brain, improving auditory processing and hand coordination.[nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/427311a)
1.3.3.5.9. Pro: Brain functions can be analysed in great detail and decisions consistently appear to [relate deterministically](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2112) to physical brain states.
1.3.3.5.9.1. Pro: Decisions are made by our brain. The brain is physical, so it follows the laws of physics. Free will implies the brain's physics are altered by another decision system \(not physical\) to work against the result of the "software + hardware" brain system.
1.3.3.5.9.1.1. Con: The lack of understanding of the relationship between the appearance of the physical body during waking consciousness as mechanical and phenomenal experiences themselves precludes any assertion of evidence of physicalism.
1.3.3.5.9.1.1.1. Pro: Evidence is only that which is evident to some conscious experience. There is evidence which suggest that consciousness itself transcends the brain, or life itself.
1.3.3.5.9.2. Pro: [Libet's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Libet) seminal study shows that humans make decisions before they are aware of doing so. As such, by the time we feel like we are making a choice, unbeknownst to us, the decision has already been made.
1.3.3.5.9.2.1. Con: Decisions are a balance between voluntary and involuntary, i.e. conscious and subconscious.
1.3.3.5.9.2.1.1. Pro: We involuntarily shut our eyes against a strong light, and we can choose whether to shut our eyes against a weaker light.
1.3.3.5.9.2.1.2. Pro: It's free will to subconsciously pre-decide things since our slower and conscious awareness is better for contemplating decisions.
1.3.3.5.9.2.1.2.1. Pro: Our conscious thoughts guide our subconscious, and vice versa.
1.3.3.5.9.2.2. Con: The decisions in the research studies appear to be meaningless. That such a level of non-moral non-impactful decisions are deterministic is compatible even with a libertarian free will.
1.3.3.5.9.2.2.1. Pro: Many studies simply look at a choice among random options \([such as choosing any letter in a set](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2112)\) which may lead the subjects to simply listen to their brain physical state to take a decision, and not using their actual free will.
1.3.3.5.9.2.2.2. Pro: The subjects have even been ask to act when "[they felt the urge to do so](http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nn.2112)", which is a direct demand to follow their physical instinct, and not to freely decide.
1.3.3.5.9.2.2.3. Pro: To design a study that would investigate the physical state of a person taking important decisions for his life or the life of another person would be close to impossible or unethical.
1.3.3.5.9.2.2.3.1. Pro: The devices needed to investigate brain activity prior to a decision is not discreet or easily moved, making it hard to wear or use during real-life activities.
1.3.3.5.9.2.2.3.2. Pro: Outside of the real-life, in a computer game or in a lab, a person's decisions are not necessarily freely willed but most likely made out of mood, physical feelings and simply not deeply thought of.
1.3.3.5.9.2.2.3.3. Pro: A person knowing that his brain activity is monitored for some research experience would probably be influenced in his decisions or feel like it, and may regret taking them, making the research unethical and judiciary risky for impactful decisions.
1.3.3.5.9.2.3. Con: It may be the case that testing simple mechanical decisions is the very worst way to check for free will, which may be reserved for those decisions which are arise in the most authentic, natural, and creative contexts.
1.3.3.5.9.2.4. Pro: The test was later replicated by others such as [Kreiman](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627310010822) and [Haynes](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2112) and others, extended Libet's findings by using more sophisticated technology.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5. Con: Libet's study shows that there is 200 millisecond delay between deciding to act and moving your finger, which may be purely a mechanical problem, and not a deterministic one.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1. Pro: Seeing a physical reaction before a conscious realisation may just as well mean that there is a "lag" in cognition, not that the decision itself was made without consciousness.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1. Con: If a brain does something you are unaware of, and then simply pushes it into consciousness \(as suggested by the parent claim\), there's no freedom there.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1. Con: Habitual skills, like those required for sports, performing arts, and skilled labour, are largely reflexive. We find these people highly praiseworthy and responsible for their accomplishments.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.1. Con: People with traits that are largely explained by factors other than personal choices still get praise. For example, beauty, height, IQ.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many traits that are socially praised also have [high heritability rates](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c7ad8ec263bd2479a3653415ef0040dd).
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Various studies have found the [heritability of IQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ) to be between 0.7 and 0.8.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: The heritability of height [is about 0.8](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-much-of-human-height/)
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Facial feature attractiveness has a heritability [of about 0.65](https://scholar.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1883&context=honr_theses).
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.2. Pro: Praise-talk is true when free will exists. It is false when free will doesn't exist. If praise exists, then free will exists. If there is no free will, there is no genuine praise.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.1.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.2.2. Con: Praise is a behaviour of exclamation by a person feeling impressed, amazed or proud of the achievement of another. There is no necessity for freewill; it is a directed expression of an emotion.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.2.3. Con: There is no genuine praise.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.2.3.1. Pro: Praise and praising events are often motivated by selfish desires to obtain something from the praised person
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.2.3.2. Pro: Praise of non-personal ideas and dead persons are for political agenda, ultimately motivated by selfish matters \(as illustrated by the confederates monuments debate in the USA\)
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.2.3.3. Con: Praise by people that have no special needs are common and support the existence of genuine praise
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.1.1.2.3.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.2. Pro: We are our brains, so if the decision are made by our brains, they are made by us.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: Persons without brains are incapable of making decisions.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.2.2. Con: If decisions are made by deterministic physical systems like brains, then there was no freedom in the making of the decision.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.2.2.1. Con: The brain is not widely regarded as completely deterministic. It achieves some degree consistency by using statistical averaging, but some degree of consistency is not equivalent to complete consistency.
1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.2.3. Con: Whether "decisions are made by us" is irrelevant to whether "brain states relate deterministically to brain functions" and its parent relevance for the grandparent.
1.3.3.5.9.3. Con: While decisions seem to relate deterministically to brain states, this [relationship](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/5000088/) can be changed through conditioning.
1.3.3.5.9.3.1. Con: If the process doing the conditioning is part of a deterministic system, then changes in the brain don't buy a way out.
1.3.3.5.9.3.2. Pro: If two distinct area of the brain may be differently involved in the decision process even in the same person and for the same decision, it means that the predetermination is not structural/hardwired but of higher order of abstraction, which leaves room for free will.
1.3.3.5.9.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.1.
1.3.3.5.9.5. Con: -> See 1.3.3.4.3.
1.3.3.5.9.6. Con: It may be the case that measuring the brain reflects a disproportionately greater influence of sub-personal awareness, and that personal awareness only has a footprint in brain activity.
1.3.3.5.9.7. Con: There is [no consensus](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2008/09/19/exposing-some-holes-in-libets-classic-free-will-study/) among researchers about the significance of different findings, their meaning, or what conclusions may be drawn and [papers](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/4/1080) have been written that argue the contrary. That is why there continues to be a debate.
1.3.3.5.9.8. Con: -> See 1.3.3.5.9.2.5.1.2.
1.3.3.6. Con: Determinism based on physics doesn't support the common understanding of determinism, and doesn't stand in the way of free will.
1.3.3.6.1. Pro: The laws of physics can only ever be approximations, because the evidence for them is data collected from experiments, which always have a degree of uncertainty. There is room in this uncertainty for non-deterministic processes, just as there was room for relativistic effects in the evidence for Newton's laws prior to the 20th century.
1.3.3.6.2. Pro: Determinism based on physical causation inherits the philosophical doubt about causality expressed most famously by Hume: we can't in the end tell the difference between "A causes B" and "A happens then B happens".
1.3.3.6.3. Pro: We think of dice as being random, and empirical observation confirms this.  We encounter probabilistic processes all the time in nature.  For all we know this probabilistic behavior goes "all the way down".
1.3.3.6.4. Pro: Determinism implies that it's possible in principle to compute the state of the universe at state t+1 if you know everything there is to know about the state of the universe at state t.  But there is no general analytic solution for the effects of gravitation when you have more than two bodies \(the well-known [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) in physics\).   Gravitational motion among three or more bodies is generally chaotic and non-repeating.
1.3.4. Con: Determinism is compatible with free will.
1.3.4.1. Pro: There can be a consistent will to act in a particular way due to supposed impersonal and indeterminate causes. Free will need not to be without prior cause.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Compatiblism is widely supported and [popular](https://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl) within the academic community.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Popularity does not signify truth or accuracy.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: Looking at the same [survey](https://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl?affil=Target+faculty&areas0=0&areas_max=1&grain=fine) again, under a finer resolution of the categories, removes any over all majority for any given position.
1.3.4.2.3. Con: The quoted survey is severely flawed.
1.3.4.2.3.1. Pro: There is more than one type of compatibilism, including determinism with respect to decision-making, but still with moral responsibility. While compatibilism is broad, in the quoted survey freewill is narrow \(libertarian freewill\).
1.3.4.2.3.2. Pro: The survey is not a survey of professional philosophers:
"[The Survey was taken by 3226 respondents, including 1803 philosophy faculty members and/or PhDs and 829 philosophy graduate students](https://philpapers.org/surveys/)."
That is 594 \(18%\) undefined individuals, and a total of 1423 \(44%\) non-faculty philosophers.
1.3.4.2.3.3. Pro: Philosophers may not be the relevant experts in this field. Neuroscience may be the more appropriate field.
1.3.4.2.3.4. Pro: Libertarian free will and determinism are classically considered as extremes and the absence of precise definitions for these may have pushed moderate/soft libertarians and determinists to answer "lean toward" compatibilism
1.3.4.2.3.4.1. Pro: In a multiple choices survey, respondents generally tend to answer with the moderate or neutral proposition.
1.3.4.2.3.4.2. Con: Philosophers should have strongly affirmed positions since this philosophical question is seen as fundamental to our decision making processes.
1.3.4.2.3.4.3. Pro: Classic libertarianism states that "one's actions are not determined by anything prior to a decision, including one's character and values, and one's feelings and desires" - which is obviously an extreme. [source](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/libertarianism.html)
1.3.4.2.3.4.4. Pro: Classic determinism states that for every decision there exist conditions that could cause no other decision - which is obviously an extreme. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism)
1.3.4.2.4. Pro: Our physical brains follow the laws of thermodynamics, and the principles of information processing systems we've come to understand \(we're Turing machines among others\). No combination of randomness \(whether quantum or emergent pseudo-random\) and determinism puts us the driver seat with upstream control over our physical brains. We can and do discover & then cultivate novel *degrees of freedom*, a hallmark of complex adaptive systems. This is not freedom to do otherwise, but to change & learn.
1.3.4.2.4.1. Pro: Free will is bound by the realm of possibility and as such cannot be Absolute free will.
1.3.4.2.4.1.1. Con: Free will needn't be defined as the ability to make any choice at any time, but rather the ability to make a choice at all.
1.3.4.2.4.1.2. Pro: You are free to choose between the things you are provided with. As Ford famously put it, "you are free to choose any colour as long as it is black"
1.3.4.2.4.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.5.7.3.1.3.
1.3.4.2.4.1.4. Con: Free will does not necessarily entail choosing between an infinite number of possibilities.
1.3.4.2.4.1.4.1. Pro: While getting your choice is limited by reality, you are nevertheless free to make that choice.
1.3.4.2.4.2. Pro: Free will exist only if someone have enough money to afford everything they wish to do or think. In other words, only few people have privilege to do anything without thinking about the consequenses once they can afford a great lawyer to defend them against lots of penalties
1.3.4.3. Con: Compatibilists achieve this by abridging the concept of free will. For instance, some argue that a person's ultimate choices are pre-determined, but they freely create their own motivations. This does not constitute truly free will.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: Motivations \(and everything else\) could evolve deterministically, without meaningful constraints on freedom. First, if motivations arise at random, without relation to experience/world/etc, that doesn't support anything worth calling "will".  However, if motivations evolve according to cause and effect, this doesn't imply some constraint on the motivation-states an agent is "allowed" to transit; it just implies that experience is a process.
1.3.4.4. Pro: Causes are contingent, and therefore not set in stone from the get-go.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: IF the set of starting conditions \(BB\) obtain, THEN they determine the present set of conditions. Each moment, therefore, obtains contingently \(and not of necessity\) as determined by the previous moment's conditions.
1.3.4.4.2. Pro: If there are no finite objects that universally and necessarily determine the human will, then all finite objects contingently determine the human will. Freedom is, therefore, possible.
1.3.4.4.3. Pro: Contingent causes can be impersonal and determinate causes. If human actions and choices are reducible to impersonal, determinate causes, it does not follow that human actions and choices are reducible to necessary causes.
1.3.4.5. Pro: If the universe is infinite then the number of variables to determine an action is infinite, thus indeterminable. It is therefore both deterministic and free.
1.3.4.5.1. Con: If each of the infinite universes is numbered, and everything possible happens in one of them, then the number of each universe would count as a deterministic seed for what would happen in that universe.
1.3.4.5.1.1. Con: This assumes that the is a fixed number of universes, and they all came into existence at the same time
1.3.4.5.2. Pro: If the number of universes increases over time as more decision points appear,  then each universe would be deterministic, but a decision would result in is moving from a parent universe to one of a number of children universes.
1.3.4.6. Pro: Direct causes, natural laws, the domain of time, and other immutable features of reality shrink absolute freedom of choice to a much smaller practical subset. That subset is further reduced by the less immediate but not inconsequential demands upon the individual by psychological and social pressures. From the remaining options, the individual is free to choose. Thus free will exists, but is limited in its scope by determinate factors.
1.3.4.6.1. Pro: If empiricism is true, then someone that acts “as if” they are free, is free.
1.3.4.6.1.1. Pro: "I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road." ~ Stephen Hawkin
1.3.4.6.1.1.1. Con: If that person never learned to look or didn't perceive the danger before they walked, they wouldn't look. Learning \(from experience or from others\) is a part of their past, perceiving danger is a learned skill, and thus the quote is meaningless.
1.3.4.6.1.2. Con: Empiricism is not true by its very definition. It is not logically true, nor is it reasonably true. Empiricism is a mere convenience.
1.3.4.6.1.3. Con: If they are merely "acting" free, then they are not free. Limited freedom is not freedom. Limited will, is not will. Thus we do not have free will.
1.3.4.6.1.4. Con: Our understanding of what 'Freedom' is is based on our observation of what we define as 'Free' its thus circular logic to argue that if someone looks 'free' they are.
1.3.4.6.2. Con: A common definition of determinism is that any action you take or decision you make is can be predicted with 100% accuracy.  Limiting the options would not be sufficient
1.3.4.7. Con: Determinism is compatible with the illusion of free will, not free will itself.
1.3.4.7.1. Pro: Compatibilism looks at the consequences traditionally ascribed to free will, such as "personal responsibility", and argues that those consequences are available under determinism. This perspective may be valuable, but does not make the will non-deterministic.
1.3.4.7.1.1. Con: The statement implies that non-determinism is a requirement of freedom of the will, but it is not.
1.3.4.7.2. Con: In this situation, the only thing binding one's actions is one's will.  Therefore the will is truly free, even if the action taken can be determined by an analysis of the will of the actor.
1.3.4.8. Pro: Our concept of free will used in everyday life \(e.g. our system of justice\) does not require a contra-causal mechanism, thus determinism isn't relevant to the question.
1.3.4.8.1. Con: The word 'autonomy' fits this definition better than 'free will' as it is free of the metaphysical claims attatched to the concept of 'free will'.
1.3.4.9. Con: Determinism is definitely compatible with some\(!\) definitions of free will, but not the definition used in this discussion \(the power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion\).
1.3.4.10. Pro: Deterministic causes can be controlled, understood and decided by human cognition
1.3.5. Pro: The mechanisms that underpin Time suggest that everything was determined the moment existence began.
1.3.5.1. Pro: Assuming time as a matter of perception, being it one we experience in a linear way, but not necessarily the only way of experiencing it, everything happens at the same "time", so every action happened, happens and will happen.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.2.1.2.1.
1.3.5.1.2. Con: Everything that happens, happens simultaneously. The consequence is that time always occurs as the present and is not 'linear': the past consists only of memory operations in the present, and the future is only prediction and cannot begin. The future cannot be determined, because even the operation of predicting the future changes the present and therefore the conditions from which the predictions were made.[The Future Cannot Begin](http://www.jstor.org/stable/40970217)
1.3.5.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.2.1.2.1.
1.3.5.1.2.2. Con: Time brings the perception of change, movement. But that perception is not real if time happens simultaneously. Time is not only the present. Time is past, present and future. Those three stages are the same. The difference is how a being experience it. We experience time in a linear way, but as I said earlier, that doesn't mean it's the only way to experience it. Saying that the future cannot be determined means that the existance is being built, and not already built. Existance is. No past,etc
1.3.5.2. Con: If everything was determined at the beginning of existence, then the beginning of existence itself is still undetermined, leaving room for free will.
1.3.5.2.1. Con: This is a cyclical argument, and presupposes that free will exists.  If free the assumption that free will doesn't exist, the beginning of existence would be determined.
1.3.5.3. Pro: True self-determination is impossible because it requires the actual completion of an infinite series of prior choices.
1.3.5.3.1. Pro: [Galen Strawson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen_Strawson)'s [Basic Argument](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/strawsong/), proposes that: To be truly responsible for how one is at time-point \(0\), they must have brought it about via time-point \(-1\). But to have been responsible for how one was at time-point \(-1\), one must have been responsible for how one was at time point \(-2\). This regress is endless.
1.3.5.3.1.1. Con: The regresses implied in the paradox of the Arrow or the Sorites paradoxes aren't ultimately convincing. Therefore, not all regresses are convincing.
1.3.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: And what is even more important about Zeno's paradoxes is that Space definitely exist, yet, it is when we try to rationalize its nature that we end up with paradoxical models. Likewise, the paradox of infinite regress on self-determinism shall not be taken to imply that free-will does not exist, just like the Arrow paradox does not imply that space does not exist, for we actually do know it does. If anything, it tells that free-will cannot be completely modeled with a finite-state machine.
1.3.5.3.1.2. Con: This simplistic mental exercise fails to take into account the basic biological realities of human existence, in which the regression has obvious hard and soft limits to extension, which thereby nullify the argument.
1.3.5.3.1.3. Con: Even if T-1 situation pushes me toward a choice, “free will existence” is the proposition that my choice at T0 can still be free, independent of T-1. The first assumption of the regress is already a denial of self-determination and free will, making the whole regress a circular argument.
1.3.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.3.5.4. Pro: This is a consequence the [Relative Simultaneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity) results of Einstein's theory of Special Relativity.  The present for one observer may be the past or future for an observer in a different reference frame.
1.3.5.4.1. Con: Whereas time appear relative, “if the two events could be causally connected \(i.e. the time between event A and event B is greater than the distance between them divided by the speed of light\), the order is preserved \(i.e., "event A precedes event B"\) in all frames of reference” according to the [source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) . Causality being preserved, Free will is still possible.
1.3.6. Con: Whereas it is generally accepted that there are causes to our decisions \("I did that because..."\), it is impossible to prove that this is the case for "all" the choices we make.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Since people's actions cannot be anticipated, free will de facto exists. It may not exist philosophically or physically.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: There is no free will is effectively the same as saying that a person's choice can be calculated. Since this is currently impossible, there is free will.
1.3.6.1.1.1. Con: The fact that an outcome can't be calculated doesn't imply free will. The result of throwing a dice is random event that can't be calculated. This doesn't mean that the dice has free will.
1.3.6.1.2. Pro: Even if you could build a supercomputer that would actually predict human decisions, there would be free will for human beings because this computer would not be a human being.
1.3.6.1.3. Con: People's actions cannot be anticipated due to lack of sufficient information about all the factors that determine an individual's decision.
1.3.6.1.3.1. Pro: Given the absolute knowledge of one's past, personality, up to the neural patterns of one's brain, we would be able to anticipate every decision that individual makes excluding possible random decisions.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Free will does exist because if it didn't we could create a formula or a machine that when you insert the situation and human nature, would bring out the exact action or choice that that person would make. So just to finish up, unless people create this machine, “Free will” will continue to exist
1.3.6.2.1. Con: The fact that a machine which, when you insert the situation and human nature, would bring out the exact choice that that person would make does not actually exist, do not imply that this type of machine cannot be created absolutely. Thus, the non-existence of this machine does not prove free will.
1.3.6.2.2. Con: There is too much things that are variable to determine human behavior perfectly. It's barely asking for a unicorn.
1.3.6.2.3. Con: Unpredictability does not imply freedom. [Chaotic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) are entirely deterministic yet cannot be predicted. Even if it is impossible to make the machine the claim describes free will may still not exist.
1.3.6.2.4. Con: If randomness due to microscopic particles and quantum mechanics in the human brain in any way contributes to choices or actions we make it would be impossible to predict with the accuracy the claim demands.
1.3.6.2.5. Con: This is a false dilemma fallacy.
1.3.6.3. Con: Our inability to prove causes to "all" our actions is not evidence there is no cause. It is only evidence of flawed or limited methods used to search for one.
1.3.7. Con: Very complex, cognitively meaningful behavior such as art are evidence of free will, because they exhibit the same lack of predictability as stochastic systems, but are intelligible and articulate clearly via recognizable vehicles.
1.3.7.1. Con: When studying art you have to do some research about what caused an artist to make such painting, statue, song etc... the artists' could have made such art due to: emotions, events, he/she got paid to do it and so on, so in a sense, it was caused.
1.3.7.2. Pro: The more complex a topic, the more degrees of freedom there are and the less predictable objects become.
1.3.7.3. Con: Computers now can generate intelligible and articulate art with lack of predictability. This doesn't mean that computers have free will.
1.3.7.4. Pro: Being unable to compute the outcome of a complex phenomenon due to limited resources does not mean that the computation cannot be performed if enough resources were available. Neurons are made of molecules, which are made of atoms, which follow the laws of physics. Free will is a construct used to refer to phenomena which cannot be computed due to the fact that we have limited computational resources.
1.3.7.5. Con: Complexity doesn't imply indeterminism.
1.3.8. Con: Determinism described applies to inert matter, but it cannot be applied to living organisms.
1.3.8.1. Con: Though more complex than dominoes, human decisions are made through physiology, which adheres to the same laws of physics as any other matter.
1.3.8.1.1. Con: Psychology is not a domain of physics.
1.3.8.1.1.1. Con: Psychology is applied biology, which is applied chemistry, which is applied physics.
1.3.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Psychology is not antithetical to physics. Psychologists study patterns of behavior resulting ultimately from fundamental physics. Just as a person may study a video game without needing to understand the specific states of transistors in the console’s core memory during gameplay, a psychologist needn’t understand the precise neural circuitry that leads to a behavior.
1.3.8.1.1.2. Con: All other fields \(including psychology\) are higher-order domains that are governed by the principles of physics. An example of the connection is the field of psychophysics being dedicated to analysing the effects on experience or behaviour by systematically varying the properties of perceptual stimuli along physical dimensions. [www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452214004369)
1.3.8.1.1.2.1. Con: Calling psychology a domain of physics confuses levels of analysis. For example, you can't fully understand the emotion of love by measuring physiological responses to perceptual stimuli.
1.3.8.2. Con: -> See 1.3.6.1.3.
1.3.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.1.
1.3.8.4. Pro: Domino effect is a typical example of a chain reaction. We see how cause and effect work, and how the effect is predetermined. That determination is absolute, since dominoes are inert matter. But if we line humans instead of dominoes, chain effect will fail, since some humans will refuse to cooperate. Difference here is a free will.
1.3.9. Pro: There is no evidence that humanity is a special exemption from an otherwise universally deterministic universe.
1.3.9.1. Con: A supposed lack of evidence does not indicate that no evidence exists.
1.3.9.1.1. Con: No, but it leaves the argument unsupported.
1.3.9.2. Con: In a theistic universe, free will is plausibly the result of the interaction between an immaterial soul and the human brain. As half of this equation is immaterial, it is not subject to scientific investigation. Therefore, the lack of such evidence in a theistic universe is unsurprising.
1.3.9.2.1. Con: Anything that can be interacted with can be studied in science. At best, the lack of science scientific results in this area suggested there is no such thing as a soul.
1.3.9.2.2. Pro: The relationship between the universe / world and the soul is unidirectional. While the soul can causally influence the body, the body and world cannot act upon the soul.
1.3.9.2.2.1. Pro: Souls are immaterial and immutable.
1.3.9.2.2.2. Pro: Similar to a puppeteer is causal in the puppets action but the puppet cannot move the puppeteer.  In the case of the soul there is no physically scientifically observable string.
1.3.9.3. Con: The universe is not deterministic at the atomic level.
1.3.9.3.1. Pro: This claim is supported by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. [currentscience.ac.in](http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/107/02/0203.pdf)
1.3.9.3.2. Pro: As the macro-scale universe is a aggregation of micro-scale interactions, it follows that the macro-scale universe is similarly not deterministic.
1.3.9.4. Con: There is currently very limited evidence that the actions of other species are deterministic.
1.3.9.5. Con: Consciousness may be a unique human characteristic.  Consciousness is evidenced by all humans experiencing consciousness.
1.3.10. Con: If there is no free will, then all of our beliefs regarding the existence or non-existence of free will is predetermined. Furthermore, we have no way to know whether our predetermined belief is true or false. The result of any such attempt is also predetermined.
1.3.10.1. Con: Predetermination does not invalidate the proven effectiveness of logic. In fact causal determinism demands it.
1.3.11. Pro: We can't control how incentivized we are, and how incentivized we are determines all our choices. A choice to manipulate an incentive is determined by preceding incentives, ad infinitum.

[Definition of "incentive"](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+incentive&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS721US721&oq=define+incentive&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3194j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
1.3.12. Con: If the variables that determine choices are without limit, free will is still possible, as peoples actions will in the end be fundamentally indeterminable.
1.3.12.1. Con: Whether or not one could determine the cause of another's action, does not suggest that there will was free.
1.3.12.1.1. Con: That would mean that the link between determinism and causality is extremely vague. So they would be free of any meaningfull determinism.
1.3.13. Con: There is no way to truly reduce the brain to understood mechanisms. Even if we could somehow monitor every single molecule in the head, the systems are difficult to predictably couple together. We would likely find the system behaves in accordance with a strange attractor, and similar to a weather system can only be predicted a short period in advance of events.
1.3.13.1. Con: Just because it is difficult and we don't know how, does not mean impossible.
1.3.13.2. Con: Even if predictions only cover a short period, just the fact that they exist mean that we understand its mechanisms. If we can predict a system in a period and during that period update our measurements of it, we can use them to update our predictions for the next period. Just iterate and you can predict the system indefinitely.
1.3.14. Con: Tracing back actions and choices is only meaningful in hindsight to see how we arrived, but chaos, randomness, uncertainty, and free will still have a role.
1.3.14.1. Pro: Apparent randomness is strong evidence for the existence of free will.
1.3.14.1.1. Pro: [Radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay) is a well-described [Stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process).
1.3.14.1.1.1. Pro: [It was argued](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/do-subatomic-particles-have-free-will) that particles may, in fact, be freely willing to split
1.3.14.1.1.2. Con: Stochastic processes don't imply free will. It implies however that we are acting at random without agency.
1.3.14.1.2. Pro: The quantum world is intrinsically random.
1.3.14.1.2.1. Pro: Causality requires us to consider the existence of demonstrated  randomness in the natural world as evidence for a non-natural freely willing cause
1.3.14.1.2.1.1. Pro: Unpredictability is not necessarily evidence of an absence of causality. To the contrary, chaotic systems such as market movements and long-run weather patterns are frequently unpredictable by our current means but remain clearly causal.
1.3.14.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Free will depends on the existence of causal powers of the mind, not on randomness.
1.3.14.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The causal powers of the mind are metaphysical and cannot be proven to either exist or not exist. As such, in ayerian terms, they are '[literally nonsensical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Ayer)'
1.3.14.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.1.
1.3.14.1.2.1.2. Pro: All actions appear to be spontaneous to the observer, but they may indeed be causal.
1.3.14.1.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.1.2.1.1.1.
1.3.14.1.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.1.
1.3.14.1.2.2. Pro: The simple Newtonian view of a causal universe is disputable because of quantum uncertainty. It can actually be impossible to know the outcome of an even because it is impossible to predict subatomic particles. Therefore, things are not predetermined.
1.3.14.1.2.2.1. Con: Not knowing or understanding a cause does not equal there not being a cause. We do not have the ability to perceive all of the causes in changes to subatomic particles movement or state, that does not mean it doesn't exist.
1.3.14.1.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.14.1.2.1.1.
1.3.14.1.2.3. Con: The Everett [Many Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) interpretation of Quantum Mechanics doesn't have a fundamentally random element.
1.3.14.1.2.4. Pro: Since atoms and particles act in probabilistic ways and our brain is made up of atoms and particles, our brain most likely exercises free will.
1.3.14.1.2.4.1. Pro: [It was argued](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/do-subatomic-particles-have-free-will) that particles may, in fact, have free will.
1.3.14.1.2.4.2. Con: To say a system is probabilistic means that we don't know which will be the concrete outcome of that system at a given time. This is not so say that the system has free will.
1.3.14.1.2.5. Con: Then what we get is [something that many would not consider free will](https://www.kialo.com/free-will-or-determinism-do-we-have-free-will-5685/5685.0=5685.1-5685.2309-5685.711+5685.2717/+5685.2717): All our actions are random, we are just living dice.
1.3.14.1.2.6. Con: The randomness in quantum processes could be due to the modelling assumption that only processes that can be measured are modelled.
1.3.14.1.2.6.1. Pro: Many unintuitive characteristics of quantum mechanics are only unintuitive for people who do not consider the measurements as the defining source for content of the theory.
1.3.14.1.2.6.2. Con: Beta decay produces a measurably continuous spectrum because energy is randomly distributed to electron and anti-neutrino. [Beta decay in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay?wprov=sfla1)
1.3.14.1.2.6.3. Pro: Particles do not have a classical trajectory in quantum mechanics because it cannot be measured.
1.3.14.1.2.6.4. Con: [The Heisenberg uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle?wprov=sfla1) limits strongly what measurements are possible.
1.3.14.1.2.7. Con: A proof that natural world is intrinsically random would solve several unsolved problems. Those are unsolved because nobody knows correct answer to them.
1.3.14.1.2.7.1. Pro: If the natural world is intrinsically random, then  [BPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPP_%28complexity%29?wprov=sfla1) != [P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_%28complexity%29?wprov=sfla1), because randomness would allow construction of computer that can perform computation in polynomial time that no deterministic computer can perform. In [complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity?wprov=sfla1), this problem is currently unsolved.
1.3.14.1.2.8. Con: In the context of free will: there's no strong evidence that quantum-level effects have any impact on information processing done by the brain. What we can measure seems to follow classical rules entirely.
1.3.14.1.2.8.1. Con: -> See 1.3.14.1.2.4.
1.3.14.1.2.8.2. Con: Even if the computation is causal, the interaction of a causal system with a random, or probabilistic, stimuli means that the computation was not deterministic.
1.3.14.1.2.8.2.1. Con: If the randomness of the stimuli has no discernible manifestation on the macro-level and the macro-level functionality is instead defined by a probability distribution it follows that, for all intents and purposes, the macro-level system is indistinguishable from a deterministic system.
1.3.14.1.3. Con: Even if the universe isn't deterministic, randomness does not mean we have free will.
1.3.14.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.3.14.1.3.2. Pro: True randomness does not help the case of free will at all. If all your choices are due to microscopic randomness then it is not free. That would make you no more free to make choices than an electron is free to determine its location in an electron cloud.
1.3.14.1.3.3. Con: If a person has a mechanism which chooses one of two outcomes based on a random event which occurs locally within the person's mind, then they were free to choose the outcome.
1.3.14.1.3.3.1. Con: Random means unchosen. A random event cannot be the result of a free choice or any choice whatsoever.
1.3.14.1.3.3.2. Con: Their choice would still have been bound by the causal path stemming from the random event, even if the event itself did not have a causal path preceding it.
1.3.14.1.3.3.3. Con: If your will is randomly made in your mind, it simply puts "nothing" as the one who freely decides. That is not human free will, but the free will of nothingness.
1.3.14.1.3.3.3.1. Pro: The free will of nothing is like putting "Nothing" as a all-deciding Deity
1.3.14.1.3.3.3.2. Pro: The mechanisms of gene activation in the whole body that determines the whole  human biology is believed to be partly random. But nobody is believed to be freely deciding its whole biology.
1.3.14.1.3.3.3.2.1. Pro: [The book the origin of individuals](http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/6359) deeply investigate the free nature of cells.
1.3.14.1.3.3.3.3. Pro: Randomness is defined as the absence of rule or organization, which can be rephrased in "nothing is ruling or organizing", making "nothing" as the rule and organization
1.3.14.1.3.4. Pro: If randomness underpins our actions, then we can't be in control of our actions: our actions are random rather than free, undermining the kind of control required for free will.
1.3.14.1.3.5. Pro: In philosophy, a clear distinction is made between randomness and [free will](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/).
1.3.14.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.1.2.1.
1.3.14.1.5. Pro: Humans have a tendency to call that which they do not understand 'random'.
1.3.14.1.5.1. Pro: When we toss a coin in the air, we don't understand all the forces the coin suffers during it's spin, thus the impossibility to accurately predict the outcome.  This example should illustrate the point above.
1.3.14.1.5.1.1. Con: The outcome of a con toss appears to be random, though we'r could likely determine the outcome ahead of time with enough data about initial states and forces applied. Thus, what looks random actually isn't. Similarly, human behaviour that appears random may be traceable to essentially deterministic causes. There is no reason to believe human behavior that appears random or is not understood is a result of free will
1.3.14.1.5.2. Con: Although this is true, it does not have any bearing on whether or not anything is actually random.
1.3.14.1.6. Pro: True unpredictability / randomness requires that there is no existing cause for obtaining the specific modality observed instead of any other possible modality. This observed violation of causality leaves room for free will as an ultimate cause.
1.3.14.1.6.1. Pro: Causality has not been confidently determined to apply on the quantum level. We can currently \(if tentatively\) say that causality violation is not necessarily impossible on this level as quantum behaviours are apparently governed by spontaneous information generation. Naturally there is emphasis on the 'apparently', but still it keeps the question open.
1.3.14.1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.1.3.3.3.3.
1.3.14.1.7. Con: The deterministic nature of [Stochastic processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process#Stochastic_process) is yet unknown \(á la [Bohm](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/)\) - that does NOT show that there are events without deterministic cause.
1.3.14.1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.14.1.2.1.1.1.
1.3.14.1.7.2. Con: Whereas physical stochastic processes described today may become physically "ruled" in the future, this has yet to be shown and therefore could be ultimately ruled or not.
1.3.14.1.8. Pro: The existence of spontaneous action suggests we have free will.
1.3.14.1.8.1. Con: The assumption that spontaneous actions exists is unjustified, meaning this is not a self-evident argument.
1.3.14.1.8.1.1. Pro: Neither proposition \(1\) nor proposition \(2\) have been demonstrated; therefore \(3\) remains unproven.

Rewriting using symbolic logic:
A: spontaneous actions
B: free will
-\>: if...then...
~: negation \(logical not\)
{}: assumptions

1: ~B -\> ~A
2: {A is true}
3: A -\> B

We have not demonstrated that spontaneous actions exist \(2\), therefore we cannot conclude \(3\).

We also have not proven that spontaneous actions can result only from free will \(1\), therefore we cannot conclude \(3\).
1.3.14.1.8.2. Con: A belief in "spontaneous" actions as a conscious decision, is confusing conscious thought with subconscious thought. The sub conscious "knows" [7 seconds before you decide something](http://exploringthemind.com/the-mind/brain-scans-can-reveal-your-decisions-7-seconds-before-you-decide).
1.3.14.1.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.9.2.
1.3.14.1.8.3. Pro: Even domesticated house cats exhibit signs of free choice, as they exhibit unpredictable behavior that does not conform to the will of their caretaker\(s\).
1.3.14.1.8.4. Con: -> See 1.3.14.1.2.1.2.
1.3.14.1.9. Pro: Random events occur within human brains/bodies, AND these random events can be used by a human to choose between two or more actions. [Academic support.​](http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/cogito/)
1.3.14.1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.1.2.4.
1.3.14.1.9.2. Pro: DNA mutations in cellular divisions are described as [random events](https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/mutations_07).
1.3.14.1.9.3. Pro: [Metaphysical introspection has led to consider](http://anaditeaching.com/spiritual-implications-of-quantum-theory/) thoughts as a product of subatomic randomness, making human decision the ability to shape these apparently random events.
1.3.14.1.9.4. Con: Actions caused randomly cannot be said to be "willed".  I may deliberately choose according to preference, or I may follow a random course. These two options are mutually exclusive.
1.3.14.1.9.4.1. Con: I may choose against my usual preferences, making it to appear random for the natural world.
1.3.14.1.9.4.1.1. Pro: Free will lets us be fanciful in deliberating for a while on choosing a snack, since free will can override energy efficiency.
1.3.14.1.9.4.1.2. Pro: The young soldier may not prefer to die but may choose it at the last minute when a grenade falls on the floor in the midst of a group of soldiers
1.3.14.1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.1.2.1.
1.3.14.1.10. Con: True Randomness does not exist.
1.3.14.1.10.1. Pro: Things that appear random and chaotic still have a root cause even if such a cause can not as yet be observed or measured.
1.3.14.1.10.1.1. Con: Complex and dynamic systems are indeed chaotic, like weather. However, that does not rule out that "true randomness" exists \(quantum mechanics\).
1.3.14.1.10.2. Pro: If we are unable to determine the cause of a process that seems random, it does not follow that randomness exists.  It may just mean that we don't understand what is causing the seemingly random outcomes.
1.3.14.1.10.3. Con: The Universe is intrinsically non-deterministic, showing "true randomness" in quantum processes.
1.3.14.1.10.3.1. Con: Quantum processes are only random as far as we can tell; they might be governed be rules we have not yet found.
1.3.14.1.10.4. Con: This statement is not yet proven. Albeit highly likely, it can not be formulated in such a strong manner to make a case.
1.3.14.1.11. Con: Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit "apparent randomness" yet are fully deterministic. The Newtonian physics problem of rolling dice is a good example: small changes in initial conditions which are not observed or controlled lead to very different final results.
1.3.14.1.11.1. Con: Then you should prove that chaotic dynamical systems are the only cases of chaos, which turn out to be only apparent chaos. That this systems are fully deterministic does not mean that cases of true randomness do not exist or are impossible.
1.3.15. Pro: If you consider it on an atomic scale, and accept that atoms are colliding and moving about, free of our control or influence, and that all of the physical world is made of atoms, including all of the electrical impulses of our brain, then you can understand that we have no control of the atoms, we have no control over our thoughts, and we have no free will.
1.3.15.1. Con: This doesn't destroy the idea of will, it just provides a more detailed definition of what the will is made of.
1.3.15.2. Con: Humans influence atoms all the time. How else would you explain atomic bombs?
1.3.16. Con: Human are not determinable, because of the groth of knoweledge. Humans create new knoweledge, which changes the way they act.
1.3.16.1. Pro: Predicting the growth of knoweledge is impossible, because it entails knowing everything. This is not compatible with the laws of nature.
1.3.16.1.1. Pro: For instance it would violate the increase of entropy and energy/information conservation.
1.3.16.2. Pro: The growth of knoweledge is infinite.
1.4. Con: Lived experience and observation suggest that we have free will.
1.4.1. Pro: Free will can be observed in others.
1.4.1.1. Con: It is possible we can be seeing behaviour that merely looks like free will.
1.4.1.2. Pro: The universal human experience of direct, voluntary participation in their own experience is a sound basis for treating free will as a legitimate phenomenon.
1.4.1.3. Pro: The universal human experience of having our will frustrated, diminished, augmented or compromised is a sound basis for considering free will a legitimate phenomenon.
1.4.1.3.1. Con: These are indeed perceptions that people have -- the apparent experience of free will is a phenomenon. The question is whether this experience reflects some necessary truth about how the world actually works.  The phenomenon itself does not present support for that conclusion.
1.4.1.3.1.1. Con: To exclude phenomenal appearances from 'the actual world' imposes biases about 'actuality' which ultimately are based on phenomenal appearances. Not to say that appearances can't be deceiving, but even deception and 'actuality' are only phenomenal appearances that relate to the exercise of will. We have to ask why it would make sense that any such thing as a feeling of free will could exist in a world which has no purpose for them nor concrete means to generate them.
1.4.1.4. Pro: There are several sound bases for free will which are independent from any presumed social construction. The indirect social experience of other people's will and intention is one of them.
1.4.2. Pro: The existence of the feeling of will in particular constitutes a greater potential for freedom than the absence of such a feeling.
1.4.2.1. Con: A person can "feel" as if they have free will, this does not prove its existence to anyone else.
1.4.3. Con: Feeling like free will exists does not mean that it exists; it could be an illusion.
1.4.3.1. Con: Provided that illusion of free will is good and complicated enough there is no need for real free will, because this illusion could fill it's place.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: As we can never truly know whether the free will we feel we have is real or illusory, there is no difference to matter. This means that the illusion of free will can be rightly understood as free will itself.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Con: Statement contradicts itself, starts by saying free will does not exist, ends by saying it does. The illusion of free will is, by definition, not free will.
1.4.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The appearance of a thing can be the thing itself.
I.e. An image of a mirror is both the appearance of the image in the mirror, and an image in the mirror.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Pro: Calling something a social construct doesn't make it any less true.
1.4.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Some things which are social constructs are only true within the confines of society, and are therefore less than absolutely true.
1.4.3.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Assigning a degree of truthfulness to a concept based on it's applicability across different contexts is arbitrary and doesn't convey anything useful for the purposes of assessing truthfulness.
1.4.3.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: As a fully objective and universal observation is impossible, our best tool for assessing any purported objective truth is how broadly applicable it is across a series of limited, unrelated domains.
1.4.3.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: In a room full of men with brown hair, it is true that "all men have brown hair" and "women do not exist," neither of which is a useful truth outside of that room.
1.4.3.1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: The [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) is based on this same principle.
1.4.3.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: If everyone stops believing in Gravity, it still works. If everyone stops believing in the value of money, it disappears.
1.4.3.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: If everyone stops believing in gravity, we'd no longer have the concept to explain the phenomena it relates to. Similarly, physicists used to believe in "aether", but abandoned that concept once better explanations were available. It is only possible to abandon scientific concepts because they are social constructs.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2. Con: Social constructs are only "true" in as far as people believe in them. They are not actually 'true', they are simply 'useful'.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.1. Con: Even if a definition has changed or a concept is long forgotten, the concept is still very real, since anyone using an old book can find it back and use it. A coherent concept/idea is an intellectual tool whose reality does not depend on people. To say that it disappear when we stop to use it is wrong, such as if we stop to use hammers to nail stuff they would still be able to nail stuffs.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2. Con: By this standard nothing truly exists. The concept of a 'chair' is simply a 'useful' description of an impermanent congregation of atoms, none of which contains any essence of 'chairness'.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.3.4.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.2. Con: One man's "chair" is another's "chaise," but as a congregation of matter it can still be said to be objectively real or not.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.2.1. Con: Even if everyone would start believing chairs are chaises by changing its definition, it would still be true that "what was defined before as a chair can still be found today". Whatever is the social construct we make, the chairs truly exists.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.2.2.1.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.3. Con: The actual object, the chair remains, and not only the concept of the chair, even if all people become chair-sceptics. This is the distinction between a useful fiction \(like a freewill existing only to support the justice system\) and actually extant things.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.2.1.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.3.2. Pro: There is no essential 'chairness' to the chair beyond the qualities human beings attribute to it as they percieve it as an assemblage.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.3.3. Pro: If someone who had never used a chair and learned the concept of a chair encountered a chair, it would not be percieved as a chair to them. There is therefore no reason to believe it still exists as a chair in their presence.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.3.4. Con: Free will and it's physical correlate would continue to exist, even if people lost belief in it or came up with a new word to describe the phenomenon.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.4. Pro: 'Chair' is shorthand for a particular set of configurations and relationships that groups of atoms can have, just as 'atom' is itself shorthand for certain relationships between sub-atomic particles. 'Free will' should be understood similarly; as shorthand for a highly complex physical phenomenon that can't easily be described in physical terms.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.5. Con: While no artificial things \(like Chairs\) would exist without our categories and concepts, natural things \(like atoms\) would.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.5.1. Pro: "Chairness" isn't a nature or essence; it is merely the design and function humans give to the matter they have put together by said design and for said function.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.5.2. Pro: Atoms have their being independent of human concepts and actions. While artificial things like chairs are invented, natural things like atoms are discovered.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.5.3. Con: There is no difference between artificial or natural things to the matter of existence.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.5.3.1. Pro: Even if everyone would suddenly forget what are chairs, it would still be true that "what was defined before as a chair can still be found today".
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.5.3.2. Pro: If the scientific definition change and atoms become fictional, it would still be true that "what was defined before as a atoms can still be found today".
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.2.5.3.3. Pro: 1. All concepts are informed partly by language. 2. Language is a social construct. C. All concepts are informed partly by a social construct.
1.4.3.1.1.2.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.2.1.2.
1.4.3.1.1.2.3. Pro: All scientific concepts whatsoever and without exception are social constructs, as is the scientific method itself. Calling "free will" a social construct is a trivial statement, which has no bearing at all on the validity of that concept for describing phenomena.
1.4.3.1.1.3. Con: Many people use the concept of Free Will to explain "The Problem of Evil", so at least in that context the truth matters.
1.4.3.1.1.4. Pro: The answer to the question will never present itself in a way that we can perceive within our limited consciousness. We should accept our limits and enjoy the ride.
1.4.3.1.2. Pro: The illusion complex does not prevent the hermeneutical truth of free will from existing regardless of the confines of that illusion. Much like a photograph of a photograph. The original photograph is still definitively true/real even if that existence is portrayed in a different construct of another photograph.
1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: This presupposes the existence of photographs, but if photographs are illusory then no matter how many photographs were nested within photographs, they would all still be illusory.
1.4.3.1.2.2. Con: If we never have more evidence that the original photograph exists, then it is safe to stop believing it does. To admit that "there is no free will" in reality may be compatible with the belief that free will is a necessary illusion.
1.4.3.1.3. Con: An illusion, even if consequential, is not real.
1.4.3.1.3.1. Pro: If free will did not exist, but it did seem to exist because of an illusion, then the true state of free will would be false despite the appearance.
1.4.3.1.3.1.1. Con: The definition of what is "real" or "not real" is inconsequential to whether there is or is not free will. In both states of reality whether that reality be illusory or true this does not disprove the existence of free will.
1.4.3.1.3.2. Con: Reality must be dissociated from truth. If "free will" is an illusion with inherent consequences making it necessarily true, it does not matter if it is real or not - we must believe it is true and we may never be able to demonstrate if it is real.
1.4.3.1.3.2.1. Pro: For every definition of truth, truth depends on the observer. It may be described as the result of the interaction between the observer perceptive abilities and the reality. Therefore the consequences of a so-called truth on the observer's abilities are worth to consider to evaluate the veracity of a statement.
1.4.3.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Truth is not by definition dependent on an observer and rather depends on other assumptions. See for example the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.[plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth)
1.4.3.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Truth is not a consequence of an interaction between perception and reality. The intended term seems to be belief or knowledge.
1.4.3.1.3.2.1.3. Pro: Whereas the definition of truth is controversial, none of them are independent on an observer.
1.4.3.1.3.2.1.3.1. Pro: For a truth to be falsifiable, it requires an individual conducting a test and observing the results of it.
1.4.3.1.3.2.1.3.2. Pro: All definitions of the truth in the broadly accepted Merriam-Webster dictionary are somehow dependent on the observer.
1.4.3.1.3.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: If truth is ["the body of real things, events, and facts"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/truth), then any "observers" that acknowledge or study this truth are part of this body.
1.4.3.1.3.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con: Normal dictionary definitions describe common parlor and does not offer suitable and nuanced definitions for technical terms such as "truth". For technical terms, a textbook or technical encyclopedia should be used instead. [Example: Stanford Enclyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/)
1.4.3.1.3.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: If truth is ["the property \(as of a statement\) of being in accord with fact or reality"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/truth), then both the perception of the "statement" and the definition of "accordance" are dependent on the observer, the receiver of the statement that can test its accuracy/truth nature.
1.4.3.1.3.2.1.3.2.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.2.1.3.2.1.1.
1.4.3.1.3.2.1.3.2.3. Con: All definitions of truth in [merrian-webster definition of truth](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/truth) does not acknowledge that truth is dependent of the observer.
1.4.3.1.3.2.1.3.2.3.1. Pro: From [merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/truth), definitions 1.a.1-2 are usually \(with regard to common epistemological assumptions\) not dependent; 1.b depends on interpretation but likely means widely accepted hence independent, 1.c independent, 2.a indepenent, 2.c independent
1.4.3.1.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.
1.4.3.1.3.3. Pro: An illusion does not produce all of the effects that the real thing would produce
1.4.3.1.4. Pro: The illusion of free will is all that is needed to make the 2 indistinguishable.
1.4.3.1.5. Con: If all we require in order to have free will is the belief in free will, then, much like God, when people stop believing, free will will disappear.
1.4.3.1.5.1. Con: Even if free will may disappear in the future, there is free will now.
1.4.3.1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.4.3.1.6. Pro: Humans' reason to live is to have agency, react to the world and make choices. If we are not able to make choices, we may as well not live at all. As such, even if free will is an illusion, it is a necessary one.
1.4.3.1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.
1.4.3.1.6.2. Pro: A presumption of free will is the basis for many of the pillars of modern society. Concepts such as justice, praise, and fairness are consequential at the level of human interactions and would not exist without the agreed-upon illusion of free will.
1.4.3.1.6.2.1. Con: Something being the basis of many of the pillars of modern society doesn't mean it's right or shouldn't change.
1.4.3.1.6.2.2. Con: Justice, equity and fairness can exist without the acknowledge of free will. Equity and fairness is about possibilities. And justice is the administration of punishment to the ones who break a consensual code of behaviour, it doesn't reffer to wheter you were conditioned or not.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3. Pro: If there is no free will, then our whole justice system will need to be scrapped; because it relies on you choosing your actions.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.1. Con: It may be the case that the Justice System uses free will as a useful fiction to understand people's actions, regardless of whether it is true.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.2. Con: The truth of the claim "there is no free will" does not depend on whether there is difficult or technical work to be done.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.3. Pro: If free will did not exist, it would be morally wrong to incarcerate individuals, fine them or sue them for their actions.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.4. Con: Perhaps this demonstrates an inherent flaw with the justice system
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5. Pro: Free will is a practical experience and a foundation of society. Without free will, all morality would be relativized and courts will be full of cases against causes, instead against criminals.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1. Con: The court cases would still be against criminals, but there would simply be no judgmental part in them. The question of whether or not the suspect "deserves prison time" would disappear in favor of the more interesting question of whether or not putting them in jail \(or different sentences of course\) would help them and/or society. A convicted murderer would not be imprisoned to punish him, but rather to protect the rest of society: that is an objective criterion and does not rely on free will
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.1. Con: Suggested "protection of society" is already valid and applied concern. Claim is meaningless - society is not protected from a thief or a murderer, if he continues to steal or kill in a prison. How could a sentence be even made, if attorneys would trace the causes of criminal behavior back to a childhood trauma, or eugenics, and thus find that people who are really responsible are long dead, while their fault can also be tracked back to infinity?
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.2. Con: Sometimes courts condemn criminals not just to protect society, but it seems they do so to punish the convicted individuals: see for instance elderly war criminals being condemned to prison when it is clear that they are no longer dangerous
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.3. Pro: The fact that good behaviour can allow one to leave jail earlier suggests that criminals are not emprisoned to be punished, but rather to make them more fitted to society, which is an aspect of protecting the latter. Other examples of this include different reinsertion programs \([www.huffingtonpost.com](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/if-we-want-fewer-prisoners-we-need-more-compassion-when-they-re-enter-society_us_55ad61a5e4b0caf721b39cd1\))\) , or some "nice" prison systems \([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people\))\)
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.3.1. Con: Repentance from one's crime is generally considered as a morally valuable because a freely willed change of mindset and attitude. This justifies the diminishing of jail times.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.4. Con: The question of a non-punishing justice system may simply rephrase our wording whereas the same concepts will still be essential for this justice to be functional.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.4.1. Pro: Successful rehabilitation can also be considered  an exemple of free will, since it suggests that the same biological system \(the criminal\) can actually chose not to reproduce its crimes.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.4.1.1. Pro: Success in the society protection can only be achieved by ensuring the convicted individuals will not follow the natural \(pre-determined\) course of his actions : repeating and making others to imitate him. This relies on freely willed true repentance.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.3.1.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.4.2. Pro: "This criminal deserves jail time" can be rightfully interchangeable with "we need the criminal to have jail time" in a perfect justice system, since the morality of a society should never be considered as useless
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.4.3. Pro: A moral punishment for a kid is not supposed to be because of his parents anger but because of his education. This is still punishment, a punishment that he both needs and deserves.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.5. Pro: A morally questionable conception of justice in which the criminals have no human right, because their so-called freely willed life decisions make that "they do not deserve"  humane care is frequently observed, particularly with in the case of torture.
1.4.3.1.6.2.3.5.1.5.1. Con: Justice system abuse can be predicted in justice systems focused on rehabilitation. The reality of psychiatric intensive/agressive treatments and abusive hospitalizations for psychopathic patients is one exemple.
1.4.3.1.6.2.4. Pro: It would be wrong to criticize or correct any actions at all as the very concepts of "wrongdoing" becomes absurd. Since throughout current societies and all past ones, this has to been the case -- humankind unanimously agrees in the existence of free will.
1.4.3.1.6.3. Con: Humans' reason to live is to survive long enough to procreate successfully.
1.4.3.1.6.3.1. Con: This is an unreasonable simplification of natural pressures to procreate. The human organism is more capable and complex than other organisms who merely spawn, procreate, and die.
1.4.3.1.6.3.2. Con: While procreation was once of paramount importance for our species, due to overpopulation and the current status of resources, it is no longer of primary importance.
1.4.3.1.6.3.3. Pro: Without the fundamental drive to procreate [successfully](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/is-the-meaning-of-your-life-to-make-babies/), our species would not have developed and thrived as it has.
1.4.3.1.6.4. Con: There is no evidence that the reason for human existence is to have agency. Reacting to the world is the only choice. It is important to note that if cause and effect existed before human existence, then all of human existence is caught somewhere in the middle of that chain reaction. If anything in life is necessary, illusion or not, there is no free will.
1.4.3.1.6.5. Con: There are other equally plausible phenomena from which people could derive value in living \(e.g. the quality of experience\). Therefore, freewill is not the only possible meaning to live.
1.4.3.1.6.6. Con: It is not necessarily the case that there are any objective reasons to live.
1.4.3.1.6.7. Con: Whether free will is useful or not is not the topic of discussion.
1.4.3.1.6.8. Con: An appeal to consequences is a fallacy. The unpleasant implications of a position have no bearing on its truth.
1.4.3.1.6.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.7.1.1.3.
1.4.3.1.6.8.2. Con: This response conflates two different types of question: questions of doxastic deliberation \(whether to believe that p\) and questions of inquiry \(whether p\)[\(Zalabardo 2010\)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13869790903318524). P may be false, but I can have good pragmatic reasons to believe that P, regardless of its truth value[\(Rinard 2017\)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/phpr.12229/asset/phpr12229.pdf;jsessionid=9E9877D356CC23B4684EBC06E0FE9603.f04t01?v=1&t=jctnibzg&s=548185e41ec13c16f39940938e73b822c6eae14c&systemMessage=Please+be+advised+that+we+experienced+an+unexpected+issue+that+occurred+on+Saturday+and+Sunday+January+20th+and+21st+that+caused+the+site+to+be+down+for+an+extended+period+of+time+and+affected+the+ability+of+users+to+access+content+on+Wiley+Online+Library.+This+issue+has+now+been+fully+resolved.++We+apologize+for+any+inconvenience+this+may+have+caused+and+are+working+to+ensure+that+we+can+alert+you+immediately+of+any+unplanned+periods+of+downtime+or+disruption+in+the+future.).

1.4.3.1.6.8.3. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.3.2.1.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4. Con: A truth that would eliminate your ability to live a proper life could be morally wrong, not true.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4.1. Con: What is "morally wrong" can never be involved in support for something being true or false.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4.1.1. Con: We may need the creation of a new axiomatic system to fully test the existence free will.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4.1.1.1. Con: Axioms aside, a new axiomatic system could only fundamentally contribute to establishing a proposition if the new system is not expressible in an existing axiomatic system. Which arguably contains most if not all arguments that have been considered. The need for a fundamentally different extension would therefor be remarkable and unlikely.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4.1.2. Pro: No matter how truth is defined in a system, assuming the system is consistent, the system contains some well-defined set of forms which constitute the totality of valid steps of reasoning in the system. In no accepted axiomatic system is "what is morally wrong" referenced conditions for a valid step.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4.2. Pro: If no human being can safely consider a proposition as "true", there is no coherent and valuable point in considering this proposition as truth for human race.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4.2.1. Con: The point of considering "unsafe" propositions that might nevertheless be true would be to pursue truth.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4.2.1.1. Con: There is no inherent virtue for a human being to pursue the truth independently of the human mind.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4.2.2. Pro: If the pursuit of truth has no use \(if you die/lose your mind when finding the truth, you obviously can't use it\), you would need an inherent virtue to keep believing it's coherent to pursue the truth.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4.3. Pro: Since truth is a concept, it is not fully external to human ability to think, and therefore it must not be considered as independent of it. If human ability is unable to grasp something that would be considered as "true" by a different mind/system, it would still be "not true" or untrue for human beings.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4.4. Pro: A truth that would eliminate your ability to think is not worth thinking - it is not humanly true.
1.4.3.1.6.8.4.4.1. Con: Whether a "truth" is "worth thinking" has no bearing on whether the proposition is true. The thesis is whether a proposition is true, not whether it is better to believe. The parent of the con makes a statement about validity, to which "humanly true" has not bearing.
1.4.3.1.6.9. Pro: People who believe in their power to choose make changes and improve others' lives, giving meaning to the human life.
1.4.3.1.6.9.1. Con: Believing or not in the power to choose - or free will - does not imply on adding to others' lives.
1.4.3.1.7. Con: Everything can be an illusion. That doesn't make it truthful. For example, to hallucinate you are drinking water when you are drinking bleach doesn't save you from certain death just because you thought it was water.
Same goes with a lot of things. One may beleive it is free from things that in reality keeps us captives. The feeling of freedom is not the same as freedom.
1.4.3.1.8. Pro: We need not enter into a philosophical debate between free will and determinism in order to decide how to act. Either we have free will or it is determined that we behave as if we do. In either case we make choices.

Fisher and Ury, Getting To Yes, p. 53
1.4.3.1.8.1. Pro: Let's say you're playing a computer game, you against the computer. The software is fully deterministic, given the code, current state, and inputs, the next state is determined.   Yet you play the game - because you are ignorant of the next state. That some hypothetical entity could predict the whole thing doesn't help you to deal with your ignorance of the outcome.
1.4.3.2. Con: Being as the reality of our existence is merely based on our perception of it, and we don't view ourselves as an illusion even though that may be what we are, if we perceive that free will exists, than to us it exists.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: Existing as an illusion, mirage or figment of one's imagination is not the kind of existence in dispute. Subjective experience does not make reality. There are not as many realities as there are brains, there is only one reality in our shared timeline.
1.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.
1.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.1.
1.4.3.5. Con: The fact that we feel like we have free will doesn't prove we have free will, but it also doesn't prove it's an illusion.  This comment is just a re-assertion of the initial claim.
1.4.3.5.1. Pro: The lack of free will is an illusion. It simply 'feels' like we don't have free will. No more than that.
1.4.3.5.1.1. Con: There is no evidence to support the existence of free will except that we feel we have free will. Most people feel they do have free will. Therefore the claim that we merely feel we don't have free will is both contrary to fact and without evidence.
1.4.3.5.2. Con: It's not arestatement of the initial claim that 'free will does not exist', it's a direct refutation of its parent claim.
1.4.3.5.3. Con: It's a restatement of the main claim that points to a particular reason to believe the main claim is true. It frames the argument about whether the subjective feeling of free will can be shown to be merely an illusion.
1.4.3.6. Pro: The capacity of humans to imagine non-trivial agents lends doubt to their impartiality in a rational analysis as to the existence of free will.
1.4.3.6.1. Con: Human interaction with trivial entities is either instrumental or anthropomorphic. In the latter case, humans are attributing free will to entities. The attribution of free will is based on expectations regarding free will which have been formed through prior interaction with free willing agents.
1.4.3.6.2. Con: If the ability of humans to offer a rational analysis of free will has been called into question, then it is impossible to scientifically or philosophically resolve the question of free will. Science and philosophy are, after all, human constructs.
1.4.3.6.3. Con: The hypercapacity to project agency may be a psychological feature which includes an equal and opposite hypercapacity to reduce profound and intangible phenomena such as agency to mundane elements of folk-naturalism.
1.4.3.6.4. Pro: Humans have deep 'social' interactions with felines, canines, equines, etc.
1.4.3.6.5. Pro: Human children not uncommonly socialize with dolls or invisible friends.
1.4.3.6.6. Pro: Some humans even imagine the existence of gods and angels.
1.4.4. Pro: People consider and weigh the benefits of various courses of action countless times in their lives. They would not do that if there were no choices available to them.
1.4.4.1. Pro: The fact that we regret certain decisions, suggests that there was indeed free will.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Rather than suggesting there was free will, it merely suggests that we feel as if there is free will. This is entirely consistent with the concept of free will being an illusion.
1.4.4.2. Pro: The ability for us to stop ourselves mid-action suggests free will.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: Without evidence that a decision to stop was made absent motivations caused by outside forces \(though all our motivations result from outside forces\) a decision to stop acting is no more evidence for free will than our talking an action is evidence for free will.
1.4.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.8.
1.4.4.4. Con: Decision making implies choice. If rationality is essentially about making decisions and decisions don't existed strictly speaking without free will, then reason and determinism are incompatible after all.
1.4.4.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.7.1.
1.4.4.4.2. Con: Decisions are less of choice but more of a reaction. You arrive at a point in time where you must decide, you evaluate the options you perceived, you choose on the basis of experience. But your experience is solid. Unless the past is completely irrelevant, simply that your mother told you to be nice at some point in your life will have an impact on all further choices. Everything in and before your life has had some form of impact on you and has led you to react in such a way that mirrors you.
1.4.4.4.2.1. Con: Unless the decision is exclusively reaction, and absent choice, free will still is present to an extent. "More of x" and "less of y" isn't proof. It's an explication of your impression of decision.
1.4.4.5. Con: The origin of a person's decision are [determined by actions unknown to them](https://www.wired.com/2008/04/mind-decision/). Until we know the true origin, this statement is unfounded
1.4.4.6. Con: This confuses the existence if free will with the existence if having options. Choosing among options does not imply that one chooses freely. E.g making a choice does not imply free will exists.
1.4.5. Pro: Overcoming urges and desires is the experience of free will.
1.4.5.1. Pro: If there were no free will, we would be chasing our instincts: An example of this would be that we would eat whatever food comes in front of our eyes.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: It does not follow that an agent lacking free will would necessarily behave selfishly or impulsively. Just as a robot can be programmed to act selflessly, a human's decisions can be the result of uncontrollable complicated neural circuitry that takes factors beyond impulse and selfishness into consideration.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: What determines the origin of your suggested stimuli, they can't simply pop into existence, just like free will.
1.4.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.3.3.
1.4.5.3. Con: One must look at the reason for withstanding urges to see how it's not necessarily free will. Weighing consequences against gains. "Yes, that cake looks delicious, but if I eat it I might get bigger. " And your choice will be determined by how much you care about weight versus how much you want the cake.
1.4.5.4. Con: The act of overcoming or suppressing a desire is consistently spurned by a reason to do so, be it conscious or subconscious. Without this reason, which we cannot control, we do not act against these desires, and thus, are simply subject to an alternative influence that overpowers the desire.
1.4.6. Pro: Consciousness would not exist if there were no free will. Consciousness is the best definition of 'you', and we use it to weigh up options and select a course of action.
1.4.6.1. Pro: If consciousness actually had no bearing on our choices, then it would be irrelevant to our survival, and therefore it would not have evolved in the first place
1.4.6.1.1. Con: Even if there is no free will, we do not have access to the predictor of what will happen; we have to somehow cope with that. Having to deal with incomplete information about the world might make consciousness favorable for survival.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Con: Perhaps and maybes are too imprecise for this discussion.
1.4.6.1.1.2. Con: Artificial intelligence deal with incomplete informations, but have not reached consciousness neither self awareness. Consciousness is most likely useless for this kind of problems.
1.4.6.2. Con: Consciousness might be considered as an instinctive analysis mechanism without free will.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: "Instinctive analysis" happens usually in the subconscious, there no free will is proposed. Consciousness involves an agent, which must be free for consciousness to have a meaning.
1.4.6.3. Pro: In a deterministic world, everything needs something to "determine" it, if not, the chain of determinations wouldn't exist, making the deterministic world impossible.
1.4.6.3.1. Con: It is not true that a deterministic universe requires some kind of infinite regress. The universe could just have always existed, or could be part of some set of possible universes. This claim is based on human intuitions about the nature of time which aren't supported by current science.
1.4.6.4. Con: The existence of the this 'you' can disappear with meditation. Therefore, consciousness is just the awareness of your thoughts and other experiences, which doesn't involve their creation.
1.4.6.5. Con: Consciousness is to a brain as the thumb is to a hand. It is a product of evolution. It could be argued that our [episodic memory](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00304/full) is the keystone of consciousness. It does not confirm free will.
1.4.6.6. Con: The existence of consciousness does not imply the existence of free will. In a freedom-less world, we can still evaluate options and decide on a course of action, but given the same sensorial parameters, our choice would be the same every time.
1.4.6.6.1. Con: To evaluate sensorial parameters, we don’t need consciousness. Therefore consciousness must be more than an evaluation mechanism,  i.e. free will.
1.4.6.6.1.1. Pro: A regulatory system on top of basic autonomous behaviour is very simple. It in no way requires the addition of free will.
1.4.6.6.1.1.1. Con: Such a regulatory system also in no way requires the addition of a feeling of participation and will.
1.4.6.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: Since it is indisputable that we do experience feelings of will, we are compelled to consider the modus tollens case as well as the modus ponens.
1.4.6.6.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: MT: Since feelings of will exist, something more than nested regulatory systems is required to explain them.
1.4.6.6.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: MP: Since nested regulatory systems can account for the totality of behavior of human bodies, feelings of will must be a feature.
1.4.6.6.1.1.1.2. Con: The point is that such a regulatory system \(conceivably\) *allows* for a feeling of participation.  Therefore, the model is not ruled out by an experience of participation.  This removes the logical necessity from your MT case.
1.4.6.6.1.1.1.2.1. Con: It depends on how we are treating conceivability. To me, it is no more conceivable that a deterministic universe could conjure up anything like participatory experience than it would be for a perfect circle to also be square. We would need a hypothesis of why and how  such a thing as 'will' come into the picture of mechanical regulation before it can be considered conceivable an any effective way.
1.4.6.6.1.1.1.3. Con: A feeling of participation and will is not necessarily inconsistent with Determination.
1.4.6.6.1.1.1.3.1. Con: When viewed prospectively rather than retrospectively, the existence of a feeling of participation has no parsimonious justification in a deterministic universe. A puppet which feels it is not a puppet doesn't really make sense.
1.4.6.7. Con: Consciousness doesn't require free will in order for it to have purpose. Consciousness facilitates reflection on experiences.
1.4.6.7.1. Con: Conscious reflection on experience is not needed to learn. In a deterministic world, reflection on experience is useless.
1.4.6.7.1.1. Pro: The immune system has many learning mechanisms without any evidence of consciousness .
1.4.6.7.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.3.
1.4.6.8. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.5.1.1.1.
1.4.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.1.8.
1.4.8. Con: We are oftenly unaware of our own decisions. Therefore decisions are not evidence of free will. Subconscious choices, reflexes, hypnotic suggestions, priming, effects of drugs, alcohol and other similar behaviors are examples of unaware decisions.
1.4.8.1. Con: The identification of a subgroup of decisions that are not subject to consciousness decision making processes does not preclude choice from the larger group of decisions outside the given subgroup.
1.4.8.1.1. Pro: An analogy to support the parent: examine a ship. Imagine we look at it's course over the interval of a day, and we isolate a period of time that it drifts aimlessly, because the engines are turned off. We would be incorrect to hold up the period of time that the ship was drifting, with engines off, as proof of the conclusion that the ship cannot chart a path. This is precisely the same as stating people have no ability to choose behavior because they sometimes behave without choosing.
1.4.8.2. Con: We are unaware of the full extent of the consequences of our choices, but never unaware of them. This is why there is the concept of "unaccountability". Taking a course of action is not always the result of a choice - since, in the examples given, the person is not in full control of their mental processes.
1.4.9. Con: For every finite being, there exists a finite stochastic model with equivalent behavior. Provided that free will is not contained in stochastic predictions, the behavior of finite beings can therefor never be evidence in favor of free will.
1.4.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.3.
1.4.9.2. Con: The conclusion doesn't follow from the premises. It is true that if we examine one particular set of groupings within a finite model, we could reproduce that same grouping randomly if we ran the simulation enough times. But that does not prove that the original grouping was random. It is a true statement, but it has no causal relationship with the original grouping in question.
1.4.9.3. Con: These models don't exist
1.4.10. Con: Choices have motivations.
1.4.10.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.4.11. Pro: The act of suicide is strong evidence of the existence of free will. It is an independent and organice choice made solely by the individual.
1.4.11.1. Con: This decision is made based on ones environment, usually by one who find there are no better alternatives. As such, no one commits suicide for any reason other than being pushed to do so.
1.4.11.1.1. Con: Both of these sentences are correct, but that doesn't mean there is no free will, as the person could have chosen to not commit suicide.
1.4.11.2. Con: A person kills themselves when their pain exceeds their threshold for pain management.
1.4.11.3. Con: Suicide is the ultimate act of self harm. In a world in which people could not die, the action to perform self destructive acts could always be traced to a stimulus.
1.4.11.4. Con: Suicide is never a choice. It's better to understand suicide in the the context of a thought accident. It's a number of unfortunate events that has led a person to fundamentally believe there are no other options. When there is only one option at a given time and specific situation, there is no choice involved.
1.4.12. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.6.1.
1.4.13. Con: Experience and observation don't suggest we have free will. They show we have a will \(the craving, desire or intention to act in certain ways\), but neither show nor even suggest we can do anything in any non-predetermined way.
1.4.13.1. Pro: A human mind can overcome a strong craving
1.4.14. Pro: There are insufficient prior deterministic causes to specify all the actions we decide on. Most obviously, there are many situations where a purely arbitrary decision must be made. For example, decision-regress \(meta-decision\) in our subconscious timing of decisions \(deciding to decide to decide things\) sets us deeply into freedom on a millisecond scale. As illustrated by a brief quote from fiction \(to make difficult concepts easier\) [thismoonlesssky.wordpress.com](https://thismoonlesssky.wordpress.com/2015/03/28/free-will-as-found-in-champagne-drinkers-and-robots/)
1.4.14.1. Con: The fidelity of this measurement distracts from the question. If you could locate the smallest branch of the decision tree it would still have determinable origin.
1.5. Pro: Observations in science suggest there is no free will.
1.5.1. Con: Science only observes systems as deterministic or chaotic, neither of which constitute free will. If we accept free will as a third possibility, we would also have to consider if other non-deterministic systems, such as the weather, had it.
1.5.1.1. Con: Science theorizes the Big Bang event, which created time, space, matter and energy,  and had no cause. This event exists outside the spectrum of causality, and thus outside the spectrum of determinism.
1.5.1.2. Con: Systems are not chaotic or deterministic. Chaotic systems are a category of deterministic systems. The premise of the above claim is inaccurate.
1.5.2. Con: There is no scientific experiment that can determine whether or not we have free will, making the claim that "free will does not exist" materially unsupported.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The inexistence of free will cannot be scientifically proven since there is no possibility to put two distinct human beings in exactly the same conditions twice.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Sciences \(Physics, chemistry, etc.\) are all based on determination. So if determination itself cannot be proven, nothing at all can be scientifically proven.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Whereas human determination cannot be definitely proven, science explore many material situations in which conditions are controlled enough to establish reproducibility and therefore determination.
1.5.2.1.1.2. Con: Science is not immutable. Scientific laws are not actual laws of nature but a human model of natural laws and are always subject to observation.
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: Hardly any claim regarding free will \(for or against it\) is provable, for this very reason.
1.5.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.1.
1.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.9.2.2.3.
1.5.2.4. Con: -> See 1.5.2.1.1.
1.5.2.5. Con: If there is no empirically verifiable way of proving there is free will, then according to the [verification principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verificationism), free will as a concept is "meaningless" and cannot be meaningfully discussed.
1.5.2.5.1. Pro: Concepts of a high level of abstraction \("theories"\) cannot be tested in a single experiment, however must be empirically supported by a set of experiments.
1.5.2.5.1.1. Pro: There is no single experiment that can prove by itself the paradigm of "evolution", neither of "creation" or other sets of theories explaining the origin of species.
1.5.2.5.1.2. Pro: There is no single experiment to prove the theory of relativity by itself.
1.5.2.5.2. Con: Scientific experiments are not the only way to make the empirical verification of a concept.
1.5.2.5.2.1. Con: If there is another way, and it is independently recreateable then it will become part of science.
1.5.2.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.1.1.1.3.
1.5.2.5.4. Con: The verification principle is self refuting, for the verification principle itself is neither a tautology nor empirically verifiable.
1.5.2.5.5. Pro: Falsifiability is the defining characteristic that distinguishes science from pseudo-science. [Falsifiability in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability?wprov=sfla1)
1.5.2.6. Pro: It is still not understood how human consciousness work exactly, even if sub-consciousness influence has been proven.
1.5.2.7. Con: Science is one avenue to discovering truth about the human condition, but certainly not the only one.
1.5.3. Pro: Evolutionary biology undermines belief in the existence of free will.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Since we evolved from very primitive organisms that don't possess free will, it is not possible that we have free will, since there is nothing in the biology or structure of the forms of life from which we evolved that could have mutated into whatever the source of free will is alleged to be.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Electrotonic dynamics present as a candidate to resolve the hard problem of consciousness; their presence is emergent and certain and, cuspped, provide a mechanism for free will.
1.5.3.1.2. Con: It is speculative to say that primitive organisms do not have free will.
1.5.3.1.3. Con: We have many things that the primitive organisms we evolved from did not have, and which we ought not to have by the logic of your argument, including consciousness, self awareness, abstract thinking, etc.
1.5.3.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.2.
1.5.3.2. Con: The existence of doubt, reflection, and self criticism support the existence of agency. The existence of worry and anxiety support the existence of agency. There would be no evolutionary basis for these emotions if we were not able to select behavior from a variety of options.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: Anxiety is triggered by certain kind of stimuli or thought like a spider or the thought of death. It's rather a mechanical psychic process, it'd rather be an argument against free will. Anxiety is triggered as a aversive stimuli when a nefarious stimuli is encountered to avoid it. It's rather in favor of a "program line" coded into the brain.
1.5.3.3. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.
1.5.3.4. Con: The idea that there is no free will would not be favorable for survival. It is commonly associated with apathy, depression, melancholy, losing interest for life etc. Not being favorable for survival makes it less probable.
1.5.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.6.8.
1.5.3.4.2. Pro: Depression, apathy and melancholy are symptoms of a loss of meaning in life. The fact that our lives don't have a predetermined meaning grants us the power to freely choose which meaning to give it.
1.5.3.4.3. Con: This supports the idea of the illusion of free will, but not free will itself
1.5.3.5. Con: Free will lets us override our involuntary reactions that evolved for efficiency.
1.5.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.3.3.
1.5.3.5.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.6.1.1.
1.5.3.5.3. Pro: Flinching is involuntary so it evolved to be energy efficient, while pursuing a fanciful goal of training months or years to resist flinching is free will \(so it isn't energy efficient\).
1.5.3.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.1.9.4.1.1.
1.5.3.5.5. Pro: Involuntary reactions \(e.g. flinching\) evolve to favor energy efficiency, yet free will lets us override that and choose to instead react inefficiently.
1.5.3.5.6. Con: A choice is made in focusing one's willpower, but there is always a reason, a cause for focusing willpower. Thus if there is a cause the independence of the action is diminished if not eradicated.
1.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.5.
1.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.5.6. Con: Free will is not "all or nothing." Even if in theory it does not exist, in practice it does.
1.5.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.1.1.5.3.
1.5.7. Pro: The laws of physics as we know them are either deterministic or fundamentally random. Either way, they are out of our control.
1.5.7.1. Con: The laws of physics are also probabilistic, meaning that events and motivations merely change the distribution of possible outcomes and choices, but don't necessarily determine them.
1.5.7.2. Pro: In computer science, there is an unsolved problem "P=NP?" that represents question of whether computer program execution that is nondeterministic can compute more than corresponding deterministic execution.
1.5.7.2.1. Pro: [P=NP](https://www.kialo.com/p-%3D-np-15955)
1.5.7.3. Con: Scientific theories \(including the laws of physics\) are not facts and don't prove anything.  If there is good evidence for free will, then we will have to revise our theories.
1.5.7.4. Con: The laws of naturel leave a lot of room to act. Apart from breaking them people can do anything with sufficient knowledge.
1.5.8. Con: If determinism is true, then the our understanding that determinism is true is based on chance conditions of physics and chemistry, not reason and logic. If determinism is false, the conclusion is obviously incorrect.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Without free will, the scientist cannot choose what conclusions to draw from these observations, but must conclude what she is determined to conclude. Therefore such conclusions cannot be trusted.

If determinism is true, then the conclusions are based on chance conditions of physics and chemistry, not reason and logic. If determinism is false, the conclusion is obviously incorrect.
1.5.8.1.1. Con: Predetermination does not invalidate the proven effectiveness of logic. If determinism is true, not only are conclusions in accordance to deterministic patterns \(which makes them logical\), but they must be in accordance to such patterns and such patterns must be valid \(rendering such conclusions correct\).
1.5.8.1.2. Con: If determinism is true, all that happens is in accordance to patterns. Patterns which we happen to intellectually grasp and systematize into something we call "logic".
1.5.8.2. Con: Predetermination does not invalidate the proven effectiveness of logic. In fact causal determinism demands it. Thus determinism does not invalidate our conclusions.
1.5.9. Con: Some scientific concepts and observations cannot be explained without the existence of free will.
1.5.9.1. Pro: The multiverse theory implies that one's own eventual "fate" is governed entirely by the choices made by the individual. Destiny depends on free will.
1.5.9.2. Pro: The natural selection of some mental features \(through evolution\) suggests the existence of free will.
1.5.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.2.
1.5.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.4.
1.5.9.2.3. Pro: Pain would have no reason to exist if there were not free will. Pain teaches animals about certain kinds of dangers.
1.5.9.2.3.1. Con: Pain and aversive reinforcement are two component mechanisms of the system that makes our actions deterministic.
1.5.9.2.4. Con: Evolution can be entirely deterministic and still work.  The weaker of the species always die out and the stronger thrive.  Computer simulation with fixed seeds show this.
1.5.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.14.1.
1.5.10. Pro: To believe in free will is to believe that cause and effect is not absolute.  In other words, to believe in free will is to believe in magic.
1.5.11. Con: Science cannot explain or understand consciousness. Therefore, this question is outside the bounds of current science.
1.5.12. Con: Science can only help to understand the deterministic component of the brain: tests and empirical evidence fails to test metaphysical constructs.
1.5.13. Pro: Free will is not compatible with our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the universe and is therefore more likely not to exist.
1.5.13.1. Con: Determinism is not compatible with our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the universe either \(i.e. quantum physics\).
1.5.13.1.1. Con: Determinism is not required to negate any rational cobception of free will. It's not relevant that the undercounted isn't deterministic. Random, non deterministic events do not lend any support to the existence of free will.
1.5.13.2. Con: The Earth orbiting around the Sun was not compatible with our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the universe not so long ago, and look at us now.
1.5.13.2.1. Con: Just because it's not compatible with our understanding of the universe doesn't mean it's impossible. But it does mean that we have absolutely no reason to think that it is in fact possible.
1.5.13.2.1.1. Pro: Saying that our understanding could one day shift to allow for the existence of free will is a poor argument. One could say the same thing about anything from telepathy to tarot reading.
1.5.13.3. Con: There is no scientific \(or otherwise\) model of the mechanisms that govern the universe that is not compatible with the agency of free actors.
1.5.13.3.1. Con: Agency is not free will. "Free actors" is not defined, and asserting that we are "free actors" appears to beg the question.
1.6. Con: It is necessary to believe in free will as humans could not function without it. Universal belief in a metaphysical concept is all that is needed to guarantee its existence.
1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.6.
1.6.2. Pro: Absence of free will is not a pragmatic idea as societies depend on its existence.
1.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.6.2.
1.6.2.2. Pro: We must necessarily assume other people have free will if we are to successfully communicate and socially interact with them.
1.6.2.2.1. Pro: Our abilities to have social, rather than just instrumental, interactions with others are predicated on the assumption that we are dealing with non-trivial agents.
1.6.2.2.2. Con: Most social interactions between humans are of the 'trivial/instrumental' variety, e.g. "How are you?", "Please", "Thank you".
1.6.2.2.2.1. Con: Even the semantics of social conventions such as "please" and "thank you" contain implicit references to the free will of the interaction partner. It is because we recognize in others the capacity to choose to not satisfying our intentions that we conventionally plead with them or thank them when they do. This is implicit in the convention's meaning, whether others actually have the choice or not \(e.g. thanking a shopkeeper\). We don't, after all, thank our television after an evening's viewing.
1.6.2.2.2.2. Con: 'Thank you' and 'please' are evidence of free-will. We, as social creatures, understand the person across from us has no obligation to help - they utilise their free-will to choose. 'Thank you' and 'please' are rewards for choosing to help us.
1.6.2.2.3. Con: Non-trivial agency is not dependent on free-will and can exist in its absence.
1.6.2.2.3.1. Con: The onus is on the claimant to demonstrate how this is possible. Furthermore, this argument is not whether free will "exists", but whether it must be attributed to other people for social interactions to be possible.
1.6.2.2.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.6.
1.6.2.2.5. Con: Deep emotional conversations happen in works of fiction without the characters needing free will.
1.6.2.2.5.1. Con: Our ability to comprehend those social interactions in fiction are dependent on our ability to relate them to the kinds of social interactions we have previously experienced with other people.
1.6.2.2.5.2. Con: Writing a fictional work requires attributing free will to the \(generally anonymous\) readership, and writing it in such a way that the readers would choose to read the work in the first place, and are satisfied enough with it to continue once they've begun reading.
1.6.2.2.5.3. Con: Well, they're works of fiction.The author hasn't given the characters free-will. The author is a totalitarian whom decides everything they say and do - more evidence of his free-will to write and decide who these characters are.
1.6.2.2.6. Con: The practical requirement for the assumption of free will's existence does not confirm it's existence, merely it indicates that human's are not sufficiently computationally robust to accurately analyse the complex system that is another person, and instead must treat them as free agents to avoid energetically and systemically taxing cognitive processing in every social interaction.
1.6.2.3. Pro: The concept of free will is necessary so that humans feel like they have a responsibility to choose right over wrong.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: Free will is a crucial concept for the use of 'should' or 'ought to' These concepts lie at the heart of all society's legal systems which keeps citizens in check to avoid chaos from ensuing.
1.6.2.3.1.1. Pro: If there was no free will, humans would just capitulate to their appetites and desires without considering how it would affect others for they would feel justified in abandoning their reason.
1.6.2.3.1.1.1. Con: [Thomas Hobbes famously tackles this question.](http://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html) It is reasonable and logical for humans to form societies which restrict these appetites because otherwise life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." Complex and restrictive societies arise as a natural economic consequence of humans' survival instincts. In this model, empathy is actually an evolutionarily advantageous animal behavior we've bred into our own population.
1.6.2.3.2. Con: If there were no free will, then humans wouldn't be able to choose right over wrong in the first place, nor would there exist any feeling of 'choosing' anything at all.
1.6.2.3.2.1. Con: Illusion of choice would still exist, because conscious processes would still be as they are. Only difference is more objective understanding of what human choices are based of when observing and analysing human environment.
1.6.2.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.6.8.
1.6.2.5. Con: People act and societies function as if there is not free will.
1.6.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.5.1.
1.6.3. Pro: Holding determinist beliefs can foster nihilist viewpoints and lead someone into inaction or destructive behaviour. It impairs the decision making process by relieving an individual of personal responsibility.
1.6.3.1. Con: This only proves that living in a lie is easier than facing reality.
1.6.3.2. Con: This begs the question implying that there is a free decision making process that can be impaired. A determinist would argue that all choices are unavoidable and that the beliefs that go hand in hand with them are held inevitably.
1.6.3.2.1. Pro: It is still, however, possible that the deterministic process yields better results when applied given a \(possibly wrong\) belief in free will than a belief in determinism.
1.6.3.3. Con: Nihilism does not inherently lead to destructive behaviour. A person can be a nihilist and still live a happy productive life
1.6.3.4. Con: This point supports the view that there is no free will by illustrating that we in-fact must act a certain way as to avoid so-called destructive behavior. It is precisely the absence of free will that causes avoidance of behavior deemed destructive.
1.6.3.4.1. Pro: Personal responsibility is an adaptive human construct designed to enable the collaboration essential to coexistence, a fundamental part of maximizing the flourishing of our species
1.6.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.1.6.
1.6.3.6. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.6.8.
1.6.3.7. Con: The question is whether "free will" exists, not if believing in a lack of "free will" is immoral.
1.6.3.7.1. Pro: The main question is a question of inquiry \(whether p\); not a question of doxastic deliberation \(whether to believe that p or not\). Although pragmatic argument can decide questions of doxastic deliberation, they cannot decide questions of inquiry, since they do not bear on the fact of the matter, whether p or not.
1.6.3.7.2. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.6.8.4.
1.6.3.8. Pro: If free will is needed to think or live, then free will is real as far as we can tell since any claim of free will inexistence is irrational because impossible to think coherently.
1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.4.3.1.6.8.
1.6.5. Con: Most societies \(families, religions, governments\) in the world today and in history rely on deterrence and punishments to enforce and justify their system.Therefore free will is not a real societal need.
1.6.5.1. Pro: The use of "free will" as a justification for our societies is real, but just optional. Therefore, there is no way that the "free will concept" was invented to justify our societies \(their justice system, their existence, or any other concept\).
1.6.5.2. Pro: Some societies are held together only through the intense use of violence, fear and similar mass manipulation procedures \(dictatorial states for instance\), proving that the creation of the "free will concept" is not needed for a society to function.
1.6.5.3. Pro: If you stop to pay your taxes, you will not receive at your door a teacher to help you freely choose to pay your taxes, but law enforcement will forcefully get the amount you refused to pay, and/or even restrict your liberty \(imprisonment\).
1.6.5.4. Pro: If a small 1- or 2-yo kid tries to cross a busy street, most parents will not try to make him freely choose not to cross, but just grab him no matter how he protests.
1.6.5.5. Pro: Most religions support that God judge men, by putting them in some kind of punishment - in present tense, at death, or at some Final Day. This retribution or its expectation is widely presented to justify the unconditional, therefore not free, abiding by religious rules.
1.6.6. Con: Social constructs with no sound basis are simple methods used to impose an unfair society - something people tell you to make you serve their ideology/serve them.
1.6.6.1. Pro: The origin of the irrational concept of free will may be similar to the origin of the "evil persons" concept. Both irrational concepts could have been invented as a justification for moral authority and punishment against persons who were claimed to have been "born evil" or to have "chose evil".
1.6.7. Con: Necessity for the sake of it implies the opposite of free will. If you have to have free will then you have not. Free will also means that you have to be able to choose not to have a free will.
1.6.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.7.3.1.
1.6.8. Con: Buddhists reject the concept of free will consequently people can and do function without it.
1.6.9. Con: Belief in free will in a deterministic universe is simply a predetermined belief. By the same token, belief in determinism in a deterministic universe is a predetermined belief. Neither side "chooses" what they believe.
1.6.10. Con: Belief \(or a necessity to believe\) is not evidence nor proof of the truth of said belief.
1.6.11. Con: Belief in free will is not universal, therefore the existence of this metaphysical concept is not guaranteed.
1.6.12. Con: There is no way to claim free will is or is not.
1.6.12.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.1.
1.6.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.6.
1.6.12.3. Pro: It is impossible to prove the claim. Open possibilities, probabilities, dismissals as incoherent, or evidences are not sufficient to support the statement "there is no free will", which is an unequivocal, positive statement, which burdens the claimant with the necessity to materially disprove it's existence.
1.6.12.3.1. Con: Arguments can support a statement without being sufficient for a deductive proof.
1.6.12.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.
1.6.12.5. Con: In a hypothetical universe where everything has natural deterministic causes, provably, there is no free will.
1.6.12.6. Pro: If you are inside the system \(universe\) it might be very difficult/impossible to tell.  However, getting an outsiders perspective might be even harder.
1.6.12.7. Con: There can be a way but we have not yet discovered it. Therefore, the current non-existence of a way does not prove it does not exist.
1.6.12.8. Con: Claims are easy to make, but claims alone cannot be used as justification or proof.
1.6.12.9. Con: I hereby claim that free will is not. That act alone is sufficient disproof of the claim "There is no way to claim free will is or is not."
1.6.12.9.1. Pro: A claim that some proposition p cannot be claimed to be the case is trivially disproved by making the claim that proposition p is true.
1.7. Con: -> See 1.3.14.1.
1.8. Con: Moral responsibility cannot exist without free will. Since moral responsibility does exist, by modes tolens, free will must also exist.
1.8.1. Con: The existence of moral responsibility as a fact of natural law is itself debatable.
1.8.1.1. Pro: It's desirable but we can't conclude it exists just because we want to. Not in a way that we can bring into existence anything it would require by modus tollens.
1.8.2. Con: Moral responsibility is consequent, not antecedent to free will and its existence is questionable
1.8.3. Con: The concept of moral responsibility varies widely among cultures. In some cultures responsibility extends to a person's community, with no claim to be relying on any individual's agency. Therefore moral responsibility is possible without free will
1.8.4. Con: In the case where "Moral responsibility" is just a mood or mindset of one or more individuals and where "free will" is a physical thing: whether or not the natural universe allows for arbitrariness beyond determinism, and if so whether or not we experience that through our perception of free will; then counter to your claim, a mindset of moral responsibility certainly *can* exist without free will.  You can simply be wrong about whether or not free will exists.
1.8.4.1. Con: Not all accounts of moral responsibility reduce it to moods and mindsets.
1.8.4.1.1. Pro: Many believe that the [capacity to reason leads necessarily to moral responsibility](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/).
1.8.4.1.2. Pro: Moral responsibility may have originated as something like a mood but was elevated beyond this because of its value to society and to individuals \(the principle of [beneficence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/principle-beneficence/)\).
1.8.5. Con: Moral responsibility serves a purpose in society. Even if there is no free will, it's useful to have some deterrent punishment to discourage the same behavior in others. It's a matter of cause and effect. So, we can assign moral responsibility to people even if there is no free will. Moral responsibility is a tool created by us to serve a purpose.
1.8.5.1. Con: The fact that moral responsibility is useful doesn't mean that it's arbitrarily made up. In other words, it may very well be that it's not so much "created' as "discovered".
1.8.5.2. Pro: Moral responsibility is an assumption under which we judge for the use of punishment. Punishment is a form of reprogramming tending toward more moral behavior.
1.8.6. Pro: This argument works if one has reason to believe moral responsibility is true.  Many find reasons to believe that moral responsibility is true \(and many don't\). [plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/)
1.8.6.1. Con: It is not in evidence that a kind of moral responsibility exists which would require free will.
1.8.7. Con: Moral Responsibility has more to do with our innate sense of fairness or balance, than about accountability, or punishment. We are bound to seek retribution, justice, or revenge. Therefore moral responsibility supports a lack of free will, not the existence of it.
1.8.8. Con: Morality is a meme that is evolving based on it's ability to improve our lived experience. This does not require free will
1.8.9. Con: Moral responsibility; morality, is the product of social conditioning. It is possible to train a cat to use a human toilet, this does not imply that the cat has free will and decides to use the toilet, it has simply been conditioned to do so.
1.9. Con: Free will is an [axiom](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/axioms.html). If you try to deny it, you have already accepted it.
1.9.1. Con: That's not how [axioms](http://planetmath.org/Axiom) work. An axiom is a given to a system. But there is always a system without the axiom and a system with the negation of that axiom. So I could say "there is no free will" is an axiom, or it could be a theromem proven from other axioms.
1.9.1.1. Pro: The only system relevant to the question, “Do we have free will?” is the actual nature of human consciousness. In this context, as opposed to theoretical mathematics, axioms are exactly as Rand indicated in the link in my post. You implicitly accept the truth of free will in the very act of asking the question or denying its validity, e.g., when asking: you assume that you have the freedom to inquire; when denying, you assume that you have the freedom to reach a negative conclusion.
1.9.2. Pro: If free will did not exist, it would be impossible to discuss free will.
1.9.2.1. Con: No, it would not be.  It could be predetermined that you would have a discussion about free will.
1.9.2.1.1. Pro: One could write a program which expresses each statement found here.
1.9.2.2. Con: One can discuss unicorns, dragons and angels, but taking about them doesn't mean they exist.
1.9.3. Con: The fact that you try to deny free will does not mean you have accepted it.  It could be predetermined that you try to deny free will.
1.9.4. Con: There's no evidence that free will is a Randian axiom.
1.9.5. Con: Rand's conception of axioms is not compatible with logic which allows for proof by contradiction. Proof by contradiction is accepted as a viable proof and Rand's logic is therefore not rational.
1.10. Pro: To have a truly ‘free will’, means to have a will free from external influence. If there exists any factor which originated outside of the individuals own mind, then it is a will bound by external factors/limitations.
1.10.1. Con: Just because a will is influenced by outside factors doesn't mean there is no element of choice. To some extent I can choose how I react to what I encounter in the world.
1.10.1.1. Con: But also, your choices will always depend on the social context, the way you've been raised, culture, so you cannot control them in an absolute manner. Realising or not, you opinion might have been shaped by some books you read or thoughts you heard
1.10.1.2. Pro: Social context, culture or the way one has been raised may influence moral 'truths' and decision making processes. However, this does not disprove at least some base elements of agency, ie; refraining from suicide.
1.10.1.2.1. Con: Having agency isn't having free will. A decision to refrain from suicide is caused by outside factors - genes and environment- just like all other decisions we make.
1.10.1.3. Con: An 'element of choice doesn't establish that a free will exists. Simply making decisions/choices is not the same making decisions/choices freely.
1.10.1.4. Pro: Humans create new knoweledge to solve problems. Because of this their influence is potentially endless and needs to be distinguished from other objects with the concept of free will.
1.10.2. Con: Only if external factors alone determine a response is it bound by external factors.
1.10.2.1. Con: Only if external factors alone determine a response is it completely bound by external factors.
1.10.2.2. Con: All internal factors are determined by external factors.
1.10.3. Pro: Choices are based on the intrinsic nature of a person and their experiences. Neither of these are a person's choice. Therefore, a person's mechanism of choosing is the result of external factors entirely.
1.10.4. Pro: Unless a being is omnipotent, its will is restricted to a certain extent.
1.11. Con: People wouldn't desire free and democratic societies if it were not for the existence of free will.
1.11.1. Con: A person could be compelled to ask for democracy.
1.11.2. Con: There is no evidence to support the proposition that the current state of the world \(i.e. a world where people want to and do live in democratic societies\) requires free will.
1.11.3. Pro: In terms of being free of other peoples influence free will is a valid concept.
1.12. Pro: Free will exists only as a mental construct.
1.12.1. Con: The term "mental construct" implies solipsism. Determanistic solipsism implies there is no reality.
1.12.1.1. Con: Solipsism \(the belief that nothing exists but the self\) is only supported if everything is mental constructs. One thing \(free will\) being a mental construct does not prove and is not strong evidence for solipsism being true.
1.12.2. Con: The same could be said of causality, which is the main principle obstructing the whole idea of free will.
1.12.2.1. Con: Causality fits with observations. Free will is not compatible with observed causality.
1.12.3. Con: This Statement is just a restatement of the premise, it doesn't support it in anyway.
1.12.3.1. Con: This claim is clearly different from the premise as it concerns mental constructs. It supports the premise as it explains why people feel free will exists when all evidence points to its nonexistence.
1.12.4. Pro: People believe that free will exists, but according to modern models of physics, it's not possible to act free of constraints. Our mind results from physical phenomena dictated by the circumstances of our birth and subsequent environmental influences.
1.12.5. Pro: Free will is a comforting idea for those shackled by the responsbilities of society. [frame-poythress.org](https://frame-poythress.org/free-will-and-moral-responsibility/)
1.13. Con: Current scientific knowledge is insufficient to support either argument. We can't predict, with high certainty, the actions others will take. We don't have a scientific model that explains consciousness. Therefore all valuable arguments should be logical, metaphysical, moral or religious in nature.
1.14. Con: If human will is not free, what \(or who\) constrains it.
