Discussion Title: Students Keep "No Platforming" Contentious Speakers. Should They Stop?

1. Social justice movements should abandon the use of [no-platforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUS_No_Platform_Policy) at universities
1.1. Pro: As a political tactic, no-platforming is ineffective.
1.1.1. Pro: The no platforming of speakers is a slippery-slope. The policies and tactics used to silence social justice movements' opposition can eventually be used against them.
1.1.2. Con: No platforming is not necessarily a political tactic as a defensive one, it is primarily an act to defend students who may feel persecuted by a speaker's more harmful rhetoric or views ,anti-LGBT or racist speakers, for example.
1.1.2.1. Con: There are other ways to protect people that feel persecuted by a speaker's rhetoric, without the negative effects of no platforming. i.e. trigger-warnings or good information about the contents of the speech. You do not need to attend a talk if you know that the person is harming you.
1.1.2.2. Con: No platforming protects feelings of persecution by actively discriminating based on political identity.
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Not allowing someone to verbally attack other people's identities is hardly political discrimination, it is, perhaps, a balance between rights that has more beneficial results than disadvantages.
1.1.3. Pro: People cannot be familiar with good counter-arguments to a position they've never heard. This leaves supporters of the no-platformed with more developed arguments and the illusion that there are no good counter-arguments.
1.1.4. Con: No-platforming might not to be an effective tactic to limit a contentious person's impact, but it is an effective tactic in a positive way: It demonstrates a clear stand against discriminating positions. By taking action, instead of only using words, the message against discrimination is far more clear.
1.1.4.1. Con: Letting those with opposing views speak bolsters the credibility of your own position by signifying that you have actually heard the other side.  Most times, opposition is to someone else's rendition of that speakers ideas/opinions. Let yourself hear it directly from the speaker, then offer opposition.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: Preventing those with evil views from speaking limits one's knowledge of their positions, and restricts one from intellectually defeating such evil views. In this way no-platforming one's opposition could easily  one's opposition much more than allowing them to speak.
1.1.4.2. Con: Students can participate in [non-disruptive](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/03/13/how-controversial-speaker-drew-protests-was-able-give-his-talk-franklin-marshall) and pro-speech protests that, while making their position clear, do not prevent someone from speaking.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: The fact that there are other tactics available does not make no-platforming any less effective.
1.1.4.3. Con: If "taking action" means demonstrating discriminatory marginalization and power of veto over controversial or innovative thoughts and ideas, then 'no platform' is counter-effective.  The only message is that of power, authoritarianism and conservative, status quo thought-policing.  Any feelings of "positive" affect are purely related to ego and realization of power.
1.1.4.4. Con: The only clear message of opposition to an idea is an intellectual and rigorous refutation of that idea. Any other message is just a display of righteousness, or noise.
1.1.5. Pro: Denying certain ideologies a public platform forces them to adopt private platforms \(Such as online discussion groups\), where dangerous ideas can go unchallenged and moderate supporters can become more radical.
1.1.6. Pro: No-platforming is effective at accomplishing some political goals, but those political goals \(such as entrenchment within one's political party\) are themselves counterproductive to discourse.
1.1.7. Pro: No-platforming makes people with oppressive views less visible to mainstream society. As a result, oppression \(like sexism and racism\) appears less prevalent, causing ignorance and complacency about the severity and seriousness of those issues.
1.1.7.1. Con: When 'no platforming' prevents a controversial figure from speaking, it creates additional media coverage and reaches audiences far wider in mainstream media than would occur otherwise.
1.1.7.1.1. Pro: When [Richard Spencer](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/10/20/why-didnt-gainesville-become-charlottesville-when-richard-spencer-came-visit/785329001/) spoke at the University of Florida, he was met with 2,500 demonstrators who intended to prevent his message from being heard. The result, however, was that what otherwise would have been an easily forgotten coffee chat of among a dozen white nationalists gained national media coverage, enabling Spencer to deliver his message to millions.
1.1.7.1.2. Pro: At both Cambridge and Oxford universities, their public speaking Unions have defied the 'no-platforming' policy adopted by the broader student associations. In Oxford, protests surrounding the invitation for [Marine Le Pen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/marine-le-pen-front-national-oxford-union-university-speech-delayed-protesters) did not stop her from addressing the Union but rather called into question the idea of 'no-platforming' as a threat to free speech.
1.1.7.1.3. Pro: At[Cardiff University](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-27/lehmann-greer-and-the-no-platforming-scourge/6887576), students [attempted](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-27/lehmann-greer-and-the-no-platforming-scourge/6887576) to prevent Germaine Greer from speaking due to her views on transgender women. However, the campaign did not stop her from speaking but instead drew [mainstream](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/18/transgender-activists-protest-germaine-greer-lecture-cardiff-university) media's attention to her views and the 'no platforming' policy.
1.1.7.1.4. Pro: No-platformed speakers and their ideas may get increased attention, like in the case of [Milo Yiannopoloulos](http://Milo Yiannopoloulos), whose book sales skyrocketed after the UC Berkeley protests.
1.1.7.2. Pro: No-platforming can serve to protect the non-platformed views, as it refuses them exposure, argument and criticism, resulting in stunted but unopposed growth on marginal areas of discussion; it lets them flourish 'underground'.
1.1.7.3. Con: This is fallacious because people who are no-platformed usually tweet about it afterwards.
1.1.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.1.9. Pro: No-platforming might even be counterproductive where speakers manage to gain sympathy because they appear as victims of censorship or oppression.
1.1.9.1. Pro: In this context, students developing extremists views can be more open to no-platformed speakers that they regard as victims and be persuaded by their rhetoric more easily.
1.1.9.2. Pro: The membership of [conservative](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/02/17/student-lefts-culture-intolereance-creating-new-generation-ofconservatives/) clubs has risen in the US and recently several free speech societies have been created in the UK. No-platforming, often carried out by left-identified institutions and students, seems to propel other students to more conservative positions.
1.1.9.3. Pro: Julie Bindel argues that disinviting her from a panel proves an [anti-feminist crusade](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/09/no-platform-universities-julie-bindel-exclusion-anti-feminist-crusade). It allows her to appear as a victim of anti-feminism, avoiding having to speak about her negative opinions regarding transgender individuals.
1.1.9.4. Pro: Some students reject no-platforming and advocate to work with the event’s organizers to be able to control its format and make sure there is actual [debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/opinion/a-controversial-speaker-comes-to-campus-what-do-you-do.html?_r=0), as well as organising parallel events. These methods prevent controversial speakers from gaining support.
1.1.9.4.1. Con: However, that is still not a [solution](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/opinion/a-controversial-speaker-comes-to-campus-what-do-you-do.html?_r=0), as Ann Coulter's cancelled event pointed out. Despite the students' efforts to organise an event with plurality of views, dates and venues could not be sorted out. Coulter managed to turn the situation into her advantage claiming in the media: “It’s a sad day for free speech”.
1.1.9.4.1.1. Pro: For example, Ann Coulter was never no-platformed: the university cancelled her speech for [security](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/ann-coulter-berkeley-speech.html) reasons, and offered her another date — when students are no longer in class. However, she rejected.
1.1.9.4.1.1.1. Con: Which means ultimately they used tactics to indirectly no-platform her - she was still no-platformed.
1.1.9.5. Pro: Milo Yiannopoulos for example appears as a reasonable person commenting on the [Berkeley](https://nyti.ms/2k5tmys) protests that shut him out as a speaker.
1.1.9.5.1. Con: At his recently canceled speech, [Milo Yiannopoulos](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/uc-berkely-protests-milo-yiannopoulos-publicly-name-undocumented-students-cancelled-talk-illegals-a7561321.html) was reportedly planning on naming undocumented students. Thus, it was not simply his ideas which were being "no-platformed" but his intention to do tangible harm to vulnerable people.
1.1.9.5.1.1. Con: The tangible harm is a result of those people breaking the law, not because of someone naming the perpetrator of that crime.
1.1.9.5.1.1.1. Con: Even if someone breaks the law, offenders are still entitled to their right to privacy. [Criminal records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_records_in_the_United_States) should only be accessed by companies for employment screening purposes, not publicly announced.
1.1.9.5.1.2. Pro: [Yiannopoulos](http://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2016/12/16/breitbart-s-milo-yiannopoulos-doubles-down-harassing-transgender-university-wisconsin-student/214849) has a history of verbally attacking students at his speeches: previously, he showed a picture of a transgender student, outing her and mocking her appearance, as well as directing transphobic slurs at her. The student was in the audience.
1.1.9.5.2. Con: How reasonable or polite someone is, or appears to be, has no bearing in the matter. It is the ideas they express \(including hate speech\) that are the reason why they are banned from speaking.
1.1.9.5.2.1. Con: In a mediated and attention-driven world, the appearance and image that surrounds a statement strongly affects reactions to it. The audience might perceive speakers that were banned for good reasons as the victims of exclusion, if the speaker presented their ideas well.
1.1.9.5.3. Con: The rest of Milo Yiannopoulos's persona hardly presents the portrait of a reasonable person. For example, right after the Berkeley protests, a [video](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/video-shows-milo-yiannopoulos-speaking-fondly-pedophilia-article-1.2977071) of Yiannopoulos defending pedophilia surfaced. In the context of these other allegations, those who supported a no-platforming policy appeared quite reasonable.
1.1.9.6. Pro: There's an idea that the more you try to hide something the more it comes to light.
1.1.10. Pro: The proliferation of social media makes it easy for everyone to access free platforms which reach millions of people. Thus, no-platforming would not stop students or organizations from a widespread audience.
1.1.10.1. Con: Ideas gain more prestige, veracity or validity depending on the context. Thus, an academic context \(which its main purpose is to create and disseminate knowledge\) can validate them more than social media.
1.1.10.2. Con: Regardless if the ideas being no-platformed are spread using social media, the tactic is a political stand taken by the university as an institution or their students to show their disagreement with those ideas.
1.1.10.2.1. Con: No platforming doesn't show disagreement with the ideas, but only unwillingness to listen to them or incapability to counter them.
1.1.11. Pro: Protests can make activists suffer from bad press, especially if they are associated with violence.
1.1.11.1. Pro: In the wake of protests over Charles Murray's speech, activists at Middlebury have suffered a spate of bad press, even from [outlets](http://2017/03/middleburys-liberals-respond-to-an-protest-gone-wrong/518652/) sympathetic to their core cause.
1.1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.
1.1.11.3. Pro: As several [protests](http://www.salon.com/2017/04/17/this-is-just-the-beginning-alt-right-rejoices-as-violent-protests-rock-berkeley/) in Berkeley university have turned violent and have been extensively shown in the media, the valid reasons protesters may hold end up fogged up by [violent](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/02/protests-milo-yiannopolous-berkeley-mark-new-low-campus-craziness/) images.
1.1.11.3.1. Con: It was, black-bloc [anarchists](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-black-bloc-uc-berkeley-protest-20170203-story.html), not Berkeley students, who were responsible for the violence.
1.1.12. Pro: No-platforming emboldens those groups we seek to censure and crystallizes their negative views. A far stronger position is to give them a platform and thoroughly dismantle their arguments in public. To fail to do so is a kind of social and academic cowardice unbecoming of any great democracy.
1.1.12.1. Con: A debate with different opinions is difficult as most speakers get invited to formats that include lectures, master classes, theatre shows or speeches within very constrained events, therefore, the time and space for a real debate to happen is unlikely.
1.1.12.1.1. Pro: [Condoleezza Rice](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/nyregion/rice-backs-out-of-rutgers-speech-after-student-protests.html?_r=1) was being invited to be a commencement speaker. That format does not provide a forum to hold her accountable or engage in any meaningful conversation.
1.1.12.1.1.1. Pro: This is a format that actually honors the person, and usually involves them receiving an honorary diploma.
1.1.12.2. Pro: A programme where guest speakers with socially controversial or seemingly unreasonable views are invited to debate with students could be implemented as a compromise, enabling this sort of exchange.
1.1.12.3. Pro: If parties with extreme views are allowed to speak up, they may be naturally eliminated because people will hear how ridiculous the ideas are, and thus are able to reject them.
1.1.12.3.1. Con: If discriminatory ideas were to die because they lack merit, they would have died out. Instead, they have prevailed, therefore not giving them a platform to be discussed and amplified is a better tactic to eradicate them.
1.1.12.3.1.1. Pro: Bad ideas have persisted for centuries for reasons such as prejudice, apathy, laziness, or a simple lack of alternative information.
1.1.12.3.2. Con: In European countries that allow freedom and diverse points of view, [support](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/world/europe/europe-far-right-political-parties-listy.html) for parties endorsing extreme or even [unfounded](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/0/eu-referendum-claims-won-brexit-fact-checked/) ideas has [risen](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/22/world/europe/europe-right-wing-austria-hungary.html).
1.1.12.4. Con: The grandstanding about "academic cowardice" is unwarranted and insulting to the educational system. University students pay expensive tuition to learn, not to waste time dismantling already debunked arguments from extremists. Those groups can have a platform, but they should find it in some other place.
1.1.12.5. Pro: In addition to this, if there is any misinformation or negative views in the censuring party, the no-platformers, the negative in their position also crystalises.
1.1.13. Pro: No-Platforming will only make the person being silenced more determined to get their message out.
1.1.14. Con: The more hate speech is given an audience, the more normalized it becomes within a culture, and the larger its followers grow. No-platforming is an effective method of stifling the number of followers of hate speech by taking away an audience.
1.1.14.1. Con: Fully and openly debating opposing viewpoints based on their own merit is a far more effective method of stifling its popularity, and one which does not stifle others' consistently-recognized freedoms.
1.1.14.2. Con: Given that hate speech is ill-defined and completely subjective, it is unreasonable to give anyone the authority to decide what does and does not qualify.
1.1.14.2.1. Pro: There is no clear correlation between debating or talking about an issue and normalising it or making it acceptable.
1.1.14.2.1.1. Con: An issue that is debated and presented in public platforms may become normalised. For example, LGBT advocates have fought to be seen in the media and in public as a tool for normalisation and acceptance.
1.1.14.2.1.2. Pro: For example, some journalists argue how it is possible to give a voice to those with oppressive ideas without [normalising](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/23/far-right-interview-extremists-normalise-racism) or endorsing those views.
1.1.15. Con: In the context of the large-scale propaganda machine that is modern TV news-entertainment, intellectual prestige and celebrity may translate very quickly into tangible political power.
1.1.15.1. Pro: Speakers in the 'Alt-Right' have gained social and political capital from being granted speaking appearances, which has in turned advanced their standing within politics. For example, Richard Spencer's appearances in the media have translated into leadership positions within special interest groups.
1.1.15.1.1. Con: Speakers have also gained attention and national media attention precisely for being no-platformed.
1.1.15.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.1.1.
1.1.16. Pro: No-platforming allows the Right-Wing to build a credible victim complex wherein Americans think the right-wingers are oppressed rather than doing the oppressing. Letting them talk while something more fun on campus deprives them of an audience is a more effective tactic.
1.2. Pro: No-platforming shields students from reality. This makes them poorly equipped to deal with oppressive ideas that are publicly expressed outside of university grounds.
1.2.1. Pro: Allowing controversial speakers to present their platform on campus is a necessity; to study the "opposing side" is the intellectually healthy thing to do.
1.2.1.1. Pro: No platforming prevents a very important aspect of education.  The ability to hear, discern, judge and debate a message with civility and to develop the skill to maintain composure and rationality when confronted with views one disagrees with or finds objectionable.  Shielding oneself from opposing views does not make the viewpoint disappear.  It prevents one from critically thinking about the position and forming logical arguments.
1.2.2. Pro: Part of the purpose of education is to teach students about the world as it is, in order to prepare them for when they have to make it in the world on their own.
1.2.2.1. Con: But another part of an education is helping to shape the world in the direction it should be shaped: this involves a commitment to justice.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: If the mission of universities is to make the world a better place, it is difficult to see how that is achievable by just ignoring or hiding what does not work rather than actively confronting it.
1.2.2.2. Con: Professors can teach students about oppressive practices by contextualizing them. This does not entail providing those who promote these oppressive practices with an unfettered platform.
1.2.2.3. Pro: A [study](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21719814-disinvitation-campaigns-correlate-high-sat-scores-and-wealthy-parents-colleges) showed that the universities most likely to no-platform are those in which students are more rich and privileged. The authors consider that America’s best universities contain left-wing bubbles where students conflate their own views with orthodoxy.
1.2.2.4. Pro: A university [professor](http://theconversation.com/israel-no-platforming-and-why-theres-no-such-thing-as-narrow-exceptions-to-campus-free-speech-76907) explains that, when asked about why discrimination is wrong, students are unable to go beyond asserting that it is “just wrong”. They have been “shamed by lecturers and peers into condemning inequality”, yet they have not been given reasons to articulate their discourse.
1.2.3. Pro: No-platforming reinforces harmful stereotypes about younger generations such as that they are special [snowflakes](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/28/snowflake-insult-disdain-young-people) that cannot handle opposition.
1.2.3.1. Con: [Another way](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/why-millennials-are-so-sensitive) of interpreting the so-called "snowflake" phenomenon is that younger generations are more sensitive to the suffering of marginalized groups.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Young generations are redefining freedom of speech in a more [critical](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jenni-murray-oxford-university-literary-festival-controversy-millennials-squeaking-a7666356.html) way: the right of someone to speak may not be more important than the right of someone to exist free of harm and to not be questioned.
1.2.3.2. Con: The onus for perpetuating a harmful stereotype falls on the group that uses the stereotype, not to the group on whom it applies.
1.2.3.3. Pro: [Experts](https://www.lindseypollak.com/yelling-doesnt-work-give-negative-feedback-millennials/) and [professors](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/02/AR2005060201593.html) have described new generations as less able to deal with [criticism](http://www.businessinsider.com/3-reasons-millennials-arent-ready-for-real-careers-2012-8) and challenging views, which may be a problem in the workplace.
1.2.3.4. Con: This may be due to different perceptions between generations: while 40% of US adults said in a [survey](https://www.knightfoundation.org/media/uploads/publication_pdfs/FreeSpeech_campus.pdf) that they perceive a decline in free speech, only 22% of US college students share the same view.
1.2.4. Con: We live in an unparalleled age of information access, people can read or hear about any of these ideas online. They are likely to encounter many of these ideas naturally as they use the internet and social media.
1.2.4.1. Pro: Universities are far from the only platform available to the kind of speakers in question. They are not being "silenced", and their freedom of expression is not being violated. Students who wish to hear these people speak can do so almost anywhere.
1.2.5. Pro: Students should be encouraged to research proposed speakers' records, determine whether they would want or need to hear them in person, and, if they choose to attend in opposition, prepare rebuttals.
1.2.6. Pro: According to the old advice “Let the fool speak” and “Even a fool, when he does not speak, is considered intelligent—until he speaks," students should not be afraid to hear what is on someone’s mind no matter how bad it is. If it is certain the speaker is wrong, then they should speak so everyone else will know it too.
1.2.7. Con: On the contrary, no-platforming can be a way for students to organise themselves and take part in a political action that fights what they deem unjust. This is a useful lesson for life outside university.
1.2.7.1. Con: No, because the same technique cannot be applied to no-platform speakers on public spaces, where they have a right to speak freely. By no-platforming, students never learn the ability how to effectively counter propagandists with speech, when there is no way to shut them down.
1.2.8. Pro: Confronting extreme ideas trains students in defending complex arguments.
1.2.8.1. Pro: For this to happen, universities have to make sure there is both debate space during the controversial speaker's presentation in which different voices are heard, as well as follow-up events to reflect on the ideas exposed and how they relate to that particular academic community.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: Controversial speakers may decide not to speak at universities who impose additional requirements or invite speakers with contrary views to speak at the same time. This may inadvertently prevent speakers from speaking, thereby reducing exposure to controversial speech and preventing an opportunity to challenge the speaker.
1.2.8.1.1.1. Con: Even if this scenario turned out to be true, this would simply amount to controversial speakers deciding not to speak themselves. That is far different than being denied a platform.
1.2.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: When controversial speakers do not want to take the steps required by the university, in the same manner than when a manufacturer is forced to pay the costs of cleaning the pollution they cause \(and then they decide to stop as it is no longer profitable\) they are not being “forced” to stop or not speak. The situation is analogous to "internalizing" externalities in economic decisions.
1.2.8.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.12.1.
1.2.8.2. Con: Students can be trained for this in less harmful environments, like debate clubs.
1.2.8.2.1. Con: Debate clubs or other dialectical societies operate a step removed from real world politics. While it may be possible to debate an idea in such a contained context, it does not follow that those same debaters will be able to engage directly with harmful speech in the real world.
1.2.8.2.1.1. Con: The academic environment is “removed from the real world” in the sense that students learn concepts, skills and practices in an educational context that they will professionally apply afterwards. Therefore there is no reason why this should be different.
1.2.8.2.1.2. Pro: Debating is artificial as it involves being able to support both arguments, regardless of what the individual may think about the issue.
1.2.8.2.1.3. Pro: Competitive debating has various constraints that are different from real life. For example, strict time limitations or gaining speaker points based on rhetoric style as well as substance.
1.2.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.4.
1.2.8.4. Pro: Polarised and filtered media, divisive politics or even trolling are some factors that may affect new generations and make them more averse to challenging positions. [Universities](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/higher-education-is-not-to-blame-for-no-platforming-epidemic#survey-answer) need to counterbalance this tendency by fostering debate, argumentation and civil discourse as core parts of their curricula.
1.2.8.4.1. Pro: [Facebook](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/filter-bubble-destroying-democracy/) is the primary source for political information for 61% of millennials. As Facebook's feeds are personalised, people tend to find information they agree with, creating “islands of isolation” in what once was a “global village”.
1.2.8.5. Con: Certain controversial speakers may not be open to challenge. Therefore if students confront the ideas with the speaker, they can be shut down and denied an opportunity for their challenge to be heard.
1.2.8.5.1. Pro: Even though transgender student Adelaide Kramer attended a speech by Milo Yiannopolus “with the hopes of starting a meaningful dialogue about transgender issues”, she [froze](https://mic.com/articles/162572/milo-yiannopoulos-mocked-a-transgender-student-in-milwaukee-here-s-how-she-responded#.3yyXgcZzJ) when the speaker attacked her personally \(even showing a picture\) and was afraid for her personal safety.
1.2.8.5.2. Con: Even if students are capable and intelligent, they are still going through an education process and it is unlikely they can confront someone more [experienced](http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-Canceling-Controversial/239151). To counter this and avoid no-platforming, events can be designed as debates, where two speakers with the same experience and capacity discuss opposing views.
1.2.8.5.3. Pro: If speakers shut down students, that may have a damaging impact on the students' self esteem and discourage them from speaking out again in the future.
1.2.8.6. Pro: Ideas need to win on their own merit. Debate against a tough adversary is what leads to new ideas for one's own side. The 'bad guys' will challenge your views in ways you never thought of, even if they're wrong.
1.2.9. Con: No-platforming is the first step in undermining these oppressive ideas, and preventing them from being expressed and internalized by society.
1.2.9.1. Con: In the political landscape of any given country, there can be politicians with offensive ideas and, as long as they are not unlawful, they will be able to express them and get votes. Shutting down ideas is not a tool to make them disappear. They need to be confronted in campuses and outside them.
1.2.9.1.1. Pro: [Several](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/stop-shaming-trump-supporters) [analysts](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/how-the-left-created-donald-trump-214472) have pointed out that the fact that liberals \(and traditional conservatives\) dismissed Donald Trump’s ideas as xenophobic, racist or misogynistic and even treated him as a buffoon, is one of the key factors to his victory in the US presidential election.
1.2.9.1.1.1. Pro: Some authors even mention a [link](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/how-the-left-created-donald-trump-214472) between this dismissive attitude that enraged potential Trump supporters \(enough to make them go to the polls and vote for him\) and the increase of Republicans being no-platformed in US universities.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1. Con: The link between no-platforming and the rise of Trump is speculative in the [article](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/how-the-left-created-donald-trump-214472) cited in the parent.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The author does not provide evidence of any link between no-platforming and the rise of Trump. Indeed, the only article the author cited to show evidence that no-platforming conservatives is on the rise is an op-ed that only deals with commencement speakers.
1.2.9.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Even if we grant that conservatives are being no-platformed more often, this does not establish that this is causally related to the rise of Trump.
1.2.9.1.1.1.2. Pro: In a recent survey, US college [students](https://www.knightfoundation.org/media/uploads/publication_pdfs/FreeSpeech_campus.pdf) stated that campuses “are not fully open environments” with 54% of students saying that the climate prevents some people from saying what they believe, as others might find it offensive.
1.2.9.1.1.1.3. Con: The conservative organisation Foundation for Individual Rights in Education \(FIRE\) produced a report listing events where speakers have been disinvited since 2000. The report shows a [similar](https://www.thefire.org/resources/disinvitation-database/#home/) number of attempts and actual dis-invitations for both left-wing and right-wing speakers.
1.2.9.1.1.1.3.1. Con: The number appears to be [higher](https://www.thefire.org/resources/disinvitation-database/#home/?view_2_sort=field_13|asc) "from the left of the speaker" both in attempts and in successful cases.
1.2.9.1.1.1.3.1.1. Pro: There are 233 instances "from the left" and 90 disinvitations while "from the right" there are 105 and 60 disinvitations, and 33 cases where it is not classified from the left or right.
1.2.9.1.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con: The effective disinvitations "from the left", however, represent a 38% of the total number of instances, while the effective disinvitations "from the right" and "not applicable" represent a 57% and 55% of the total.
1.2.9.1.1.1.3.1.2. Pro: There are about 87 cases of successful disinvitation attempts since 2000 from to the political left of a potential speaker, and about 57 successful attempts from the political right of a political speaker.
1.2.9.1.1.2. Con: When [feminism](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/01/warren-farrell-mens-rights-movement-feminism-misogyny-trolls) and race [equality](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-boeskool/when-youre-accustomed-to-privilege_b_9460662.html) are the dominant discourse, those who feel attacked by it counter-attack. Men’s Rights Activists or White Supremacists - more often than not, [Trump](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/us-politics/the-real-reason-donald-trump-got-elected-we-have-a-white-extremism-problem/article32817625/) supporters - are the natural by-product of social justice advancements.
1.2.9.2. Con: Just because something is expressed in a particular platform it does not mean it will be internalised by society. Those listening may consider the arguments unimportant.
1.2.9.2.1. Con: However, when those messages are repeated over and over, even at prestigious universities, they may end up being internalised and thus help [normalise](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/23/alt-right-online-humor-as-a-weapon-facism?CMP=share_btn_tw) [oppressive](https://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/alt-right-safe-space-racism-college-campuses/) behaviour.
1.2.9.3. Con: -> See 1.1.10.
1.2.10. Con: Students can be equipped to deal with oppressive ideas by being exposed to inspirational speakers who went through a discriminatory experience, rather than to oppressors.
1.2.11. Con: A professor playing devil’s advocate or courses that include alternate views may be sufficient to foster critical thinking. It is not necessary that young people are exposed to uncivil \(racist, xenophobic and misogynistic\) discourse.
1.2.11.1. Con: Critical thinking may not be exercised if students know beforehand that the speaker is simply playing devil's advocate. Critical thinking is about weighing information and choosing wisely. Students will not apply the proper weight to an argument if you know the speaker does not believe what they are saying.
1.2.11.2. Con: Should we not then 'no platform' the professor if they express views unacceptable to the university? If we benefit from hearing opposing views then censoring these opinions is counterproductive.
1.2.11.3. Pro: Professors can modulate their discourse in such a way that, even if they offer challenging views, they can do it in in a manner that does not hurt students, something a guest speaker may not care to do.
1.2.11.3.1. Con: Trying to anticipate and act in ways that do not hurt or offend students could be counterproductive. College-level education is partly about exposing students to views and ideas that might be offensive.
1.2.11.3.2. Con: It is impossible to know what aspects of a discourse might hurt or offend students. This does not mean that professors should throw caution to the wind and express volatile views in their purest forms. Instead, it means that modulation has to be done with care and that even when it is well thought out and well-intentioned, it may still hurt students the professor sought to protect.
1.2.11.3.3. Con: Guest speakers modulate their discourses, too. Some do so intentionally as a way of mitigating the perception that their perspective is one of hate, racism, or xenophobia.
1.2.11.3.4. Con: Words are not violence and no one has a right to demand protection from being emotionally offended.
1.2.11.4. Con: Professors playing devil's advocate or courses that include alternate views would require potentially offensive discourse to authentically represent the views covered in such a curriculum. Students cannot be shielded from real world issues by misrepresenting opposing ideologies.
1.2.12. Pro: When students are never confronted with those holding opposing views, they are also less capable of developing [empathy](http://www.chronicle.com/article/How-Canceling-Controversial/239151), “one of the faculties most essential to persuasion”.
1.2.12.1. Con: There are different ways to confront opposing views. Attending speeches on campus is only one of several.
1.2.12.2. Con: Empathy may be one of the faculties most essential to persuasion. But there are many ways to develop empathy. Listening to contentious speakers is simply not the only or best way to develop empathy.
1.2.13. Pro: Universities should not be safe spaces, students should be exposed to the full gamut of ideas and opinions regardless of how offensive they find them to be. The proper way to consign bad ideas to the past is to confront and then deconstruct them in the forum of debate, not to stop them from being expressed at all.
1.2.13.1. Pro: A lack of exposure to bad ideas means that more people forget how to argue against those ideas. Those who support bad ideas remain engaged with the debate, but those who would challenge them do not, and if there is a resurgence in popularity, those supporting the bad ideas benefit from their opposition's lack of preparedness.
1.2.13.1.1. Con: On the contrary, it would be more instructive for students to develop critical thinking skills by debating good ideas. Bad ideas are far easier to tear apart, and therefore a waste of time.
1.2.13.2. Con: This argument does not account for the practical limitations on time, venue availability and other resources required to host speakers. These limits argue that proposed messages should meet some baseline qualifying level of merit even to gain access to the arena. This test does not preclude analysis and debate but does help ensure quality of dialogue.
1.2.14. Con: No-platforming shelters people from the oppressive thoughts and actions that are everywhere in the media.
1.2.15. Con: No-platforming does not inherently demonstrate a lack of understanding about the speaker's issues. University-sanctioned guidance in no-platforming and/or protesting would better equip students for reality. Universities could do more to equip students to face reality by educating them in social action.
1.2.16. Pro: By the time they graduate, college students should at least be familiar with the talking points of BOTH the right and left. Listening does not mean agreement by default. Students may have well thought out opinions, but unless they address the concerns of their opponents as well, their argument will remain somewhat ignorant.
1.2.16.1. Con: There is no reason that college students should be familiar with the talking points of either the right or the left. Rather, they should be well informed and able to make critical judgments. Inflammatory speakers are not particularly helpful in achieving either of these goals.
1.3. Pro: University campuses should be spaces that are neutral with respect to ideas.
1.3.1. Con: However it can be somewhat frustrating to imagine that the "other side of the debate" frequently has to do with legitimizing some form of discrimination.
1.3.2. Con: Meritless ideas should be rejected. This is more clear-cut in some fields than others - we can say with certainty that the miasma theory of infection is meritless thanks to the scientific method, which is not as useful in the humanities - but there are ideas so ludicrous \(overtly racist ones, for example\) that they don't bear mentioning in serious intellectual discourse.
1.3.3. Pro: It is deeply important that students be left entirely free to make up their own minds about important issues. To the extent that some views are required \(or forbidden\), they are being indoctrinated rather than being given a liberal education.
1.3.4. Pro: The university should be a "marketplace of ideas."
1.3.4.1. Con: Many scholars argue that the "marketplace of ideas" is a [legitimizing myth](http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2867&context=dlj) in which ideas that are ideologically attractive are privileged over truly reasonable ideas.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Universities should not be expected to only deliver the "best ideas", but to foster a cacophonous marketplace of diverse viewpoints in which students develop their critical thinking.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: In academia, ideas frequently become discredited, and are no longer taught. For instance, a chemistry department would be unlikely to invite a modern proponent of [phlogiston theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory) to speak on campus. Some ideas, particularly those which lack any evidence whatsoever, do not merit serious consideration of adoption.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: Fostering a 'competitive marketplace of ideas' demands active intervention, not neutrality. In non-metaphorical markets antitrust law presumes the \(non-neutral\) power to decide which forms of competition are legitimate. A university 'marketplace' should be similarly non-neutral. The marketplace metaphor cannot support a laissez-faire approach to the exchange of ideas.
1.3.4.3. Con: A university's lecture halls are not neutral spaces. Giving space to speakers to some extent legitimises their discourse making it "valuable" enough to have it heard at an academic institution.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: A university can approve of the salary of a professor who has views that are deeply offensive to someone, and yet the university is not thought thereby to "legitimize" those \(allegedly\) offensive views.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: Free speech does not entail being entitled to a [pulpit](https://newrepublic.com/article/142218/colleges-right-reject-hateful-speakers-like-ann-coulter). Thus, denial of a platform is not a violation of free speech.
1.3.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.
1.3.4.3.2.2. Con: It can be argued that there is no such thing as hate speech. Since offense is not universally recognized and views on subjects change over time, any restrictions on speech that does not make a real threat or is considered libel infringes on free speech
1.3.4.3.2.2.1. Con: There are limits on free speech, such as in the case of hate speech. In these cases, no-platforming cannot be reasonably construed as a violation of free speech.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.1. Con: In the United States, hate speech is constitutionally protected, and this has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. Hateful speech is legal unless it would lead to imminent violence.  See [Hate speech in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States#Supreme_Court_case_law)  and [Brandenburg test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio#The_Brandenburg_test_\(also_known_as_the_imminent_lawless_action_test\)).
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.2. Con: Hate speech, while often with the goal of harm, has started to lose meaning and definition in our society. The parameters of hate speech is devolving into any speech that is controversial or unfavorable. Banning it will only lead to restricted freedom of speech and expression.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: Everyone should be given equal opportunity to discuss and spread their opinion regardless of the stance.  Everyone should have as much of a choice choice to listen to or ignore hate speech as they do with other speech.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.3. Con: In the UK, a study has found that [80%](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/feb/02/free-speech-universities-spiked-ban-sombreros) of universities restricted or censored free speech beyond what is required by law.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.4. Pro: Many European countries have anti [hate speech laws](http://www.legal-project.org/issues/european-hate-speech-laws) that prevent speakers from engaging in hate speech. This injunction can be enforced in advance of a speech.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: In [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung) if speech is severely insulting to a specific group of people or calls for violent or arbitrary actions against them, then that speech is no longer protected as an equal opinion.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.4.2. Pro: Hate speech, as defined in [UK law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_the_United_Kingdom), is a limit to free speech.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.5. Con: Even when no-platforming was first implemented in the UK during 1977, then-students raised concerns about it as “non democratic thought [control](http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/whats-new-about-no-platform-mania/17526#.WNlRmGTyjR0)” that could shut down views that did not align with the majority rather than just to prevent racist or sexist views.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.5.1. Pro: Even if in its inception the policy was to avoid the spread of fascism in universities, groups of students have often [misinterpreted](https://hatfulofhistory.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/by-whatever-means-necessary-the-origins-of-the-no-platform-policy/) and [abused](http://www.historyandpolicy.org/opinion-articles/articles/a-policy-widely-abused) it throughout the years.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6. Pro: In many instances, people who have been "no-platformed" have been no-platformed to prevent hate speech.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6.1. Con: The classification of speech as "hate speech" is subjective unless previously established within the relevant legal framework or institutional guidelines and therefore already forbidden or restricted. Using a hate speech label as a means to justify no-platforming paints too broad a brush that can ultimately permit one person to shut down a debate that nobody else finds reasonably offensive.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6.2. Con: There is no reason why universities should operate as isolated institutions. As countries regulate free speech and hate crime, there is no reason why universities cannot follow those laws without needing special measures.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6.2.1. Con: Laws are only effective to punish hate crimes after they have occurred and thereby protect free speech retrospectively. The prevention of people from engaging in hate speech can only be done by institutions like universities themselves by actively disallowing it to happen upfront.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6.3. Con: The risk of hate speech, perceived or actual, comprised [less than a third](http://www.businessinsider.com/list-of-disinvited-speakers-at-colleges-2016-7) of instances in [2015](https://www.thefire.org/resources/disinvitation-database/#home/?view_2_search=2015&view_2_page=1)-[2016](https://www.thefire.org/resources/disinvitation-database/#home/?view_2_search=2016&view_2_page=1) where speakers were successfully no-platformed at colleges by students getting them disinvited or shouting them down.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.5.1.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6.5. Pro: Preventing hate-speech is particularly relevant in the current context of rising [antisemitic](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/18/uk-universities-urged-tackle-rising-tide-antisemitism-campus) incidents on UK campuses.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6.5.1. Pro: [Jewish](http://thebadgeronline.com/2016/04/nus-national-conference-begins-with-controversy-for-sussex-delegates/) students have complained that universities are not effective enough at stopping antisemitic speech.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.7. Con: This is not often the case. Hate speech is often legally protected speech; same any other form of free speech. Calls for violence, which are legally defined, are distinct from declarations of hate, which are subjectively defined. For example, In the U.S., the former are illegal while the latter are protected.
1.3.4.3.2.2.1.8. Con: Depends on the definition of reasonably. Reasonable limits on free speech \(e.g. incitement to violence\), are still violations of an absolute principle of free speech \(i.e. not all violations of free speech are unreasonable\).
1.3.4.3.2.3. Con: The right to free speech entails the right to exercise the means of communication with others. In the cases in question, the speaker has purchased a platform, or more commonly, others have purchased a platform on the speaker's behalf. Therefore, violations of the right to use that purchased platform, or to be heard by the audience, are violations of the right to free speech.
1.3.4.3.2.4. Con: This post attempts to re-paint the logistics of how a university 'pulpit' actually works. A university invites a speaker, and in doing so that speaker is gifted temporary entitlement to the pulpit. Thus to de-platform the speaker is to unequivocally deny an agency to which they are entitled.
1.3.4.3.2.4.1. Con: In many cases, it is not the university as a whole that brought the speaker in but some other group affiliated in some way with the university. It is not unreasonable to expect such invitations to be subject to some sort of review.
1.3.4.3.2.4.2. Con: Even if one granted that speakers were "temporarily entitled a pulpit" by virtue of an invitation, there is no reason to think that that entitlement is the same as the right protected by free speech. Rather, it simply implies a conditional privilege - one that the university is well within its rights to revoke.
1.3.4.3.2.5. Pro: No platforming does not request a person to be punished or otherwise censored for his or her beliefs. Being denied a certain forum does not equal a restriction of freedom of speech as a general right.
1.3.4.3.2.5.1. Con: No-platforming itself is a punishment of an individual \(the speaker\) as a consequence of their beliefs and ideas.
1.3.4.3.2.6. Pro: There is a difference between freedom of speech and facilitating speech.
1.3.4.3.2.6.1. Pro: The right to free speech with one's body and one's mouth should always be protected. However, the right to amplification of free speech is not the same. Saying there is a right to use campus resources for building, protection, etc. is a right to using other's resources for amplification.
1.3.4.3.2.6.2. Pro: By denying a pulpit, Universities are not censoring speakers, they are just opting not to promote their views.
1.3.4.3.2.6.3. Pro: No one has an inherent entitlement to a forum in a university simply because they have the right to free speech.
1.3.4.3.2.7. Pro: Universities and student societies are under no compulsion to provide platforms to all who request them \([O'Keefe, p. 87](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/fr.2016.7)\).
1.3.4.3.2.7.1. Pro: When students protest campus events through pickets, petitions, disruptions, boycotts or no-platforming, they are in fact exercising their freedom of expression \([O'Keefe, p. 87](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/fr.2016.7)\).
1.3.4.3.2.7.2. Pro: Students are the ones most impacted by what happens at their universities. Thus, they should have significant say over what happens at their school.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.1. Pro: What the students want is something that can only be determined by having an anonymous vote, in which at least the majority of students vote. Someone claiming to represent a group need to actually be voted into such a position.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.1.1. Con: The member of the National Union of Students \([NUS](https://www.nus.org.uk/en/who-we-are/our-history/a-brief-history/)\), those who often apply platforming policies in the UK are democratically [elected](https://www.nus.org.uk/en/who-we-are/leadership/) by students and represent their interests.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.2. Con: Students are only at schools for a short time, meaning they have no reason to care about the long term image or impact of their decisions on the school.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.2.1. Con: There are good reasons to care about and oppose discrimination no matter how long one belongs to a certain institution. Civil rights apply everywhere, within and beyond university halls.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.2.2. Con: Students choose universities based on the educational reputation and the universities' standing in the community.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.2.3. Con: Employers pick students based, among others things, on the educational standing of an institution. If a university is known to provide a platform for controversial speakers, employers may decide against hiring a student from that institution.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.2.3.1. Con: The educational standing is quite different than invited speakers. Universities should be home to a diverse range of ideologies. Employers are not only interested in academics but the ability to navigate the real world, which sometimes requires working with or for someone with different views and values. Employers such as Google, Facebook and Twitter may be the exception to the rule.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.3. Pro: This is especially true for no-platforming that occurs regarding a commencement speaker, as commencement exists specifically to honor those who are graduating, thus their desires should hold extra weight.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.3.1. Con: Except in practice the very vocal and easily offended get to make the decision for everyone.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4. Pro: Several surveys point out that students support no-platform policies.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.1. Pro: 63% of students in the UK [support](http://oxfordstudent.com/2016/05/01/sixty-three-percent-university-students-support-no-platforming-policy/) the no-platform policy of the National Union of Students \(NUS\) .
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.2. Pro: 69% of US college [students](https://www.knightfoundation.org/media/uploads/publication_pdfs/FreeSpeech_campus.pdf) surveyed believe that “intentionally offensive” speech should be banned on campus.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.2.1. Con: Young adults do not necessarily know what's good for them. Their brains are not fully developed yet \(brains develop until age 25\).
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: Adults use the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain used to make informed and longterm decisions. Whereas teens and young adults use the amygdala, the part of the brain associated with emotions. Students are not yet mature enough to make these decisions, the university should decide what is harmful, not just unpopular.[scienceabc.com](https://www.scienceabc.com/humans/teenage-brain-development-behavior-explained-frontal-lobe-function.html)
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.2.2. Con: It is not possible for an individual to determine whether or not something someone else says is 'intentionally' offensive unless they ask them and the person says "Yes, I intended to offend."
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.2.3. Con: The problem, like in many other instances, is to determine \(or who should do so\) what is “intentionally offensive”, especially as intentions are a subjective matter clearly difficult to regulate.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.2.3.1. Con: The courts assess intentions all the time in many different areas of law. Intention can be inferred by deliberate conduct and choice of words.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Yet academic institutions may not have the resources or time to seek a court of law and therefore, the problem remains: who should asses those intentions and on which grounds.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.2.3.1.2. Con: Legal proceedings are designed to have due process and to try to be fair, it is difficult to see how those complex systems can be applied in the academic world.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.2.3.1.2.1. Con: Academic bodies have procedures in place to solve these kinds of problems. To assume in advance that they cannot do so in a fair way is overly prejudicial.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.2.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Due process is not only about the intention to be fair, it is about having the resources, the time and the regulations in place to be able to guarantee it. Those elements are specific to a court of law. Therefore, it is not about assuming in advance that academic proceedings are unfair but unable to comply with due process properly.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.4.2.4. Con: However, 78%  of US college [students](https://www.knightfoundation.org/media/uploads/publication_pdfs/FreeSpeech_campus.pdf) also said that it was more important that students were exposed to all types of speech and viewpoints, while only 22% said it was more important to ban offensive or biased speech.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.5. Pro: [Student unions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305334261_Making_feminist_sense_of_no-platforming) have the right and indeed the responsibility to set standards to protect the safety and well-being of students.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.5.1. Con: Ideas alone do not threaten the safety and well-being of students. A familiarity with a dangerous idea, and with its refutations, makes students more protected.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.6. Con: Students go to school to learn; perhaps most importantly, to learn how to think when exposed to the universe of ideas never arbitrarily limited by their own lack of imagination and experience.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.7. Con: Students do not set the curriculum or research agenda of their schools. By the same token, they should not expect to set the school's public lecture schedule.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.7.1. Con: Students do not set the curriculum, yet they do generally set extra-curricular activities. Most universities encourage that to make students more engaged with the institution and get the chance to learn outside the classroom, which is also part of their higher education.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.7.2. Con: The fact that students do not set the curriculum does not deprive them of their right to protest or veto the curriculum for good reasons like civil rights.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.7.3. Con: Many universities, for example [Brandeis University](http://www.brandeis.edu/das/committees/ucc/) in the US, have undergraduates that sit on the university curriculum committee.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8. Pro: Students navigate university in a disadvantaged position relative to other members of the academic community. Their safety should be protected by giving them the power to "no-platform" facist and hate speech.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.1. Con: There is no right to 'feel safe' in the Constitution. There IS a right to the freedom of speech. If a speaker is unable to speak if they offend someone then no one is able to speak and the most easily offended person in the world controls the speech of everyone else.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.2. Pro: [Racism](http://thetab.com/uk/bristol/2017/02/02/racism-university-national-issue-28213) and [sexism](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/women-trapped-in-universities-ivory-basements-9908457.html) are still part of university life in many occasions and students have little power to oppose them directly because they rely on these structures. No-platforming can be an instrument to address these internal issues indirectly by fostering necessary debate.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.3. Con: Discrimination or harassment \(that may pose a threat to the students’ safety\) are not the result of challenging views per se, it is the undemocratic idea that some groups should be treated badly or do not deserve a platform to speak what leads to it.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.4. Pro: Student Unions have been accused by minorities of not taking their worries seriously, as well as failing in condemning oppressive speech.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.4.1. Con: Individuals in 'minority communities' do not speak for each and every member of that minority community. 'Complaints' about unfair treatment should be investigated, not taken as factual, particularly if a next step is preventing individuals from engaging in the free exchange of ideas.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.4.2. Con: Individuals within particular sub groups on campus should not be given veto power over who is and who is not allowed to speak. That's bullying and oppressive.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.4.3. Pro: Students at [Westminster](http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/27/westminster-university-accused-of-consistently-giving-a-platform-to-extremist-students-5083007/) university have expressed their concern over religious extremists very often given a platform and described the campus as potentially unsafe to LGBT or moderate Muslim students.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6.5.1.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.5. Pro: Racial, religious or sexual minorities are not always protected by academic administrations or Student's Union. Speech that makes them targets should be limited.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.5.1. Con: Being protected from speech as an adult on a college campus is bad. Demanding protection from such speech is worse. Believing that one deserves this protection due to an immutable characteristic is antithetical to fair play.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.6. Con: They label anything that contradicts their leftist ideology as "fascist" or "hate speech" to suppress any opposing political views.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.9. Pro: Any enforcement of a potential ban against no-platforming would serve to exacerbate existing patterns of systemic oppression against the grievances of marginalized voices.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.9.1. Con: In this context there is no concern with designing rules to outlaw no-platforming. The concern is with directly encouraging no-platformers to change their tactics.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.10. Pro: Where university fees are fully paid by students, then the customer's wish should be accounted for as by any business and government/politicians should not intervene
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.10.1. Con: University fees are paid by ALL students, therefore all students have the right to hear from speakers they are interested in hearing from. No one is forced to listen.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.10.2. Pro: As long as students are paying for an education, it's their decision what they want to learn about. Unlike a truly public forum, universities are accountable to the students, first and foremost.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.10.3. Pro: A significant portion of the money that schools have comes from their students.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.10.3.1. Con: This is not the case for the majority of European universities. They are funded and managed as public institutions, with no to low or moderate fees for students \([Jongbloed](https://www.utwente.nl/bms/cheps/publications/Publications%202010/MODERN_Funding_Report.pdf), p. 16\).
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.10.3.1.1. Con: Public European universities are generally subsidised: meaning a part of their costs are paid by students \(via low or moderate fees, and in some cases no fees at all\) and the other part is paid by governments via taxpayers. Therefore, those universities are indirectly funded by the students or their families.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.10.3.2. Con: Government funding contributes significantly to universities, either through funding university places or by providing research grants to university academics or to specialist research schools.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.11. Con: That students should have significant say over what happens at their school has no bearing on the question of whether they should keep the no platforming policy or not.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.12. Con: Students who are in favour of hearing a particular speaker should, then, have the right to bring them in.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.13. Con: Many student organizations, such as student governments or unions, claim they represent the voice of the students but actually hold much different views because of low student participation/voting turnout in such groups.
1.3.4.3.2.7.2.13.1. Pro: This gives the politically motivated activists the power, not the student body.
1.3.4.3.2.8. Con: If a public university denies a pulpit to those with a particular point of view, it can be interpreted as a violation of free speech. For example, in the US, courts decided during the [Vietnam](http://www.newseuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-speech-2/free-speech-on-public-college-campuses-overview/campus-speakers/) War that “inflammatory guests” should not be denied a forum on campuses.
1.3.4.3.2.8.1. Con: There is a difference between being "inflammatory" and hate speech.
1.3.4.3.2.9. Pro: Universities are places of higher education, not entertainment or baseless opinions. A speaking platform at a University should be a coveted position earned through academic or worldly works, not given to people because their Youtube channel or blog spouts popular hate speech.
1.3.4.3.2.10. Con: Speakers are often invited by specific groups within a university. To deny other students the right to offer their platform is to violate free speech.
1.3.4.3.2.11. Con: Free speech is limited not just by government action or censorship, but also societal sanction. The threat of "[the ridicule and moral outrage of others](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freedom-speech/)" is still a restriction on free speech.
1.3.4.3.2.12. Con: It is a violation of others' rights to hear and evaluate ideas for themselves, which is the flip side to freedom of speech. Anyone who doesn't want to listen is free to absent themselves.
1.3.4.4. Pro: In a marketplace of ideas, bad ideas would die out because people will not want to "buy" into them.
1.3.4.4.1. Pro: In a true "marketplace," ideas are perpetuated and adopted if they are supported by logic, reasoning, and evidence.
1.3.4.4.1.1. Con: While this may be true in a "true" marketplace, it is also easy for a marketplace of ideas to get [distorted by money.](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/does-money-talk-in-the-marketplace-of-ideas/)
1.3.4.4.1.1.1. Pro: This report shows the large number of US foundations that fund universities. More than $20 million was granted to institutions “which promote self-government" and conservative programs or to departments which "promote conservative ideals” \([NCRP, p. 26](https://www.ncrp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AxisofIdeology.pdf)\).
1.3.4.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: This [calculation](https://www.ncrp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AxisofIdeology.pdf) only includes money directed towards explicitly conservative research, leaving out other institutions, thus the total number of conservative funding for education and research is much higher.
1.3.4.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: The Intercollegiate Studies Institute and Accuracy in Academia seeks to rid higher education institutions of their “liberal bias” and “instill in students the notions of liberty and freedom” \([NCRP, p. 22](https://www.ncrp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AxisofIdeology.pdf)\).
1.3.4.4.1.1.2. Pro: Controversial capitalist Charles [Koch](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/03/inside-charles-kochs-200-million-quest-for-a-republic-of-science/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.24ea3034be63) is spending $200 million to fund research that promotes his views.
1.3.4.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.1.
1.3.4.4.3. Pro: Discriminatory ideas, like the ones impacted by no-platforming, frequently hold little to no argumentative merit.
1.3.4.4.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.
1.3.4.4.3.2. Pro: Thus, giving them a platform will only result in the rejection of the ideals.
1.3.4.4.3.3. Con: If this is true, then there is no purpose in giving a platform to an idea just to reject it.
1.3.4.4.3.3.1. Con: On the contrary, it is vital to publicly prove exactly why it is that these ideas have no intellectual merit. If the process of deconstructing and rejecting these ideas does not happen, people who do not critically analyse the intellectual merit to oppressive ideas might be persuaded by them.
1.3.4.4.3.3.1.1. Con: It is possible to show that these ideas are bad without providing a platform for them.
1.3.4.4.3.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.12.3.1.1.
1.3.4.4.4. Pro: If someone's ideas are truly bad, then exposing those ideas to the public will be the fastest way to dispel them.
1.3.4.4.5. Con: If universities are a marketplace of ideas, No-Platforming is a necessary and effective form of quality control.
1.3.4.4.5.1. Con: "Quality control" of such a market place of ideas performed by proponents of one ideology assumes that people are unable to decide for themselves which ideas are good and which ideas are bad. Controlling which ideas are expressed is to decide what others should hear... It is censorship. People deciding for themselves which ideas and good and what ideas are bad is its own form of quality control.
1.3.4.5. Con: Universities should be in the business of promoting knowledge, not ideas.
1.3.4.5.1. Pro: Colleges are places of higher learning. The main goal of a college is fact-based education while presenting both popular and unpopular opinions on those facts. With that in mind, students should absolutely resist speakers that don't base their speeches on facts.
1.3.4.5.1.1. Pro: Speakers that do not base their discourse on facts, such as 'flat Earthers', climate change deniers, white nationalists, Holocaust deniers, and folks who promote that black people were better off as slaves should not be given a platform.
1.3.4.5.2. Con: Universities should develop a rigorous life of the mind, which includes both knowledge and ideas.
1.3.5. Con: In white countries, non-whites are under-represented in universities. Ideas which contest their rights are a further threat to their political powers, respect, mental and physical well-being, and their representation within the university.
1.3.6. Pro: No-platforming shows a fundamental lack of trust \(consciously or unconsciously \) in the worth of the own ideas. When all ideas are allowed in a debate, the best idea or a substraction of the best elements of ideas would emerge. By no-platforming people avoid facing arguments that could be stronger than their own.
1.3.7. Pro: Letting somebody speak and letting the audience evaluate their arguments is the best way to decide if the speaker is correct. That, of course, requires an audience of people who know how to judge such.
1.3.8. Pro: Universities are supposed to be places where honest debate can take place. Students are supposed to explore the universe, and part of that exploration is listening to all ideas, even those that they might not agree with. If civilization is to progress, then all viewpoints need to be heard, and honest ideas need to be discussed. In the end, either the idea will gain traction and become part of civilization, and the bad one's will be discarded. But, without debate, only emotions rule the day.
1.3.9. Pro: De-platforming defeats the purpose of everyone's personal right and assumed ability to critically evaluate and judge incoming information.
1.3.10. Pro: Universities specifically exist in order to promote the creation and dissemination of knowledge.
1.3.10.1. Pro: Frequently, knowledge comes from debating and questioning ideas.
1.3.10.2. Con: The ideas that are impacted by no-platforming have been debated, and found to lack intellectual merit.
1.3.10.2.1. Con: This seems unlikely, since the speakers' ideas were believed to have merit, as they were suggested or formally invited before the invitation was then pulled back.
1.3.10.2.2. Con: What the intellectual community considers to have merit has changed over time, showing the need to have continual debate over these issues.
1.3.10.2.2.1. Pro: Intellectual merit is based on the production of knowledge, yet that production, as long as created by subjects, is never objective. Labelling ideas as lacking intellectual merit is therefore very difficult to do, especially if they never get to be discussed.
1.3.10.2.2.1.1. Pro: Additionally, refusing to discuss ideas that are against one’s ideology \(by simply labelling them as lacking intellectual merit\) would always negate any kind of productive debate.
1.3.10.2.2.1.2. Con: A community of experts can evaluate the merits of claims that they disagree with.
1.3.10.2.3. Con: Because there are no clear standards for what should be no-platformed, the tactic can be co-opted and used against social justice movements to suppress their legitimate/meritorious speech.
1.3.10.2.3.1. Pro: When no-platforming was created there was far less influence by NGO's and rich Neoliberals in student activism. Today's student activist groups are often unwittingly shills for the suit-and-tie lobbyists of corporations who fund protest groups for their own pecuniary interests. [i-d.vice.com](https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/pappeg/whats-the-line-between-free-speech-and-hate-speech-on-campus) [www.nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/nyregion/bard-college-given-60-million-for-global-initiatives.html?_r=2)
1.3.10.2.3.2. Pro: No-platforming has shut down secular human rights activists who advocate against oppressive religious laws in Islamic countries.
1.3.10.2.3.2.1. Pro: It is hypocritical that Western students silence the voices of women who have been persecuted and fled their countries, in the name of students not feeling intimidated or discriminated.
1.3.10.2.3.2.2. Pro: Brandeis University disinvited women’s rights advocate [Ayaan Hirsi Ali](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeleef/2014/04/14/brandeis-caves-in-to-the-no-platform-for-our-opponents-crowd/#53be34b66811) as some groups equated her activism on behalf of women in Islamic countries with Islamophobia.
1.3.10.2.3.2.3. Pro: The student union from Warwick University blocked human right’s activist [Maryam Namazie](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/26/student-union-blocks-speech-activist-maryam-namazie-warwick) as her work advocating against discriminatory religious laws was accused of being 'inflammatory'.
1.3.10.2.3.2.4. Pro: [Journalists](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/07/censorship-campus-no-way-fight-fanatics) have raised concerns claiming that voices against religious fundamentalism have been shut down or not listened to.
1.3.10.2.3.2.5. Pro: At the same time, [religious](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/sep/20/westminster-university-islamic-students-society-ultra-conservative-muslims) speakers with [controversial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vLwMZDWaHk&feature=youtu.be) views \(who even engage in hate speech\) are given a [platform](http://onelawforall.org.uk/more-restrictions-at-uk-universities/).
1.3.10.2.3.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.4.3.
1.3.10.2.3.3. Pro: An [anti-racism](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/18/anti-racism-campaigner-stopped-speaking-nus-islamophobia-claims) campaigner was no-platformed for allegedly having Islamophobic views.
1.3.10.2.3.4. Pro: Feminist activist Julie Bindel was [banned](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/09/no-platform-universities-julie-bindel-exclusion-anti-feminist-crusade) at Manchester university for her views on transgender women while Milo Yiannopoulos \(with a wide background of sexists comments\) was only un-invited after outcry over double standards.
1.3.10.2.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.9.3.
1.3.10.2.3.5. Pro: The Racial Relations Act was adopted in the UK in 1965 to protect racial minorities, but has been [used](https://www.aclu.org/other/hate-speech-campus) to persecute activists of color, trade unionists and anti-nuclear protesters.
1.3.10.2.3.6. Pro: When the University of Michigan implemented a speech code following racist flyers and KKK demonstrations, the white majority [brought](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/11/race-and-the-anti-free-speech-diversion/415254/) 20 disciplinary cases against Black students' speech in the span of 18 months.
1.3.10.2.3.7. Con: Rules are created with a particular spirit and are open to interpretation over time. University faculty and ethics committees can help sort out these types of conundrums to make sure rules are not abused.
1.3.10.2.3.8. Pro: Several politicians have [pressured](http://freebeacon.com/issues/congressmen-pressure-cuny-sarsour/) The City University of New York \(CUNY\) to disinvite Linda Sarsour from being the commencement speaker.
1.3.10.2.3.9. Pro: The victims of no-platforming will have no qualms  about using no-platforming, which will entail mass firings of university faculty.
1.3.10.2.4. Con: Since these arguments tend to lack merit, having them be debated opens them up to being dismantled, preventing them from being adopted.
1.3.10.2.4.1. Pro: Since these ideas are considered distasteful as well as lacking merit, any opportunity to attack them is valuable.
1.3.10.3. Con: Knowledge production is never neutral as it is defined by the worldviews and political positions of those producing it.
1.3.10.3.1. Pro: A recent [study](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56eddde762cd9413e151ac92/t/58b5a7cd03596ec6631d8b8a/1488299985267/Left+Wing+Bias+Paper.pdf) in the UK found that individuals with left-wing and liberal views are more prominent in academia and, at the same time, conservatives have decreased along the years.
1.3.10.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.3.
1.3.10.3.3. Pro: Recognising that knowledge is not neutral enables a more honest debate between opposing views.
1.3.10.3.4. Con: Even if ideas are never neutral, the space in which they are explored can be.
1.3.10.3.4.1. Pro: Any number of debate clubs, speaker series, university departments, and yes, universities as well, have been chartered with the explicitly-stated idea that the institution does not embrace any specific political or religious views \(except for some views about the mission of the university, for example\).
1.3.10.3.4.2. Con: Universities as spaces of knowledge are the sum of their faculties. As faculties are not neutral, the university itself is not neutral either.
1.3.10.3.4.2.1. Con: It does not follow logically that, if all professors are biased, therefore the collection of all professors is biased as well. That is an excellent example of the fallacy of composition, which argues that what is true of the individual members is true of the group as a whole.
1.3.10.3.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.1.3.
1.3.10.3.5. Pro: The debate about '[whose knowledge counts](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1759-5436.2007.tb00354.x/abstract)' has theorized about this in the field of development studies, showing that mainstream knowledge tends to be shaped by power structures defining the context in which it is produced.
1.3.11. Con: Universities should be spaces where diverse ideas can be discussed in an environment that is safe and free of discrimination.
1.3.11.1. Con: A university that is free of discrimination is ipso facto neutral, not biased. To the extent to which it is biased, it discriminates against \(and is "unsafe" for\) those with the "diverse ideas" it is biased against.
1.3.11.2. Pro: Creating safe rather than neutral spaces fosters debate between people that hold different views about particular topics.
1.3.11.2.1. Con: What is viewed as "safe" to an individual will differ from person to person. A so-called "safe space" implicitly advances a message concerning what is acceptable speech. It is better that all viewpoints can be discussed, and evil ones rooted out and destroyed via discourse, rather than being able to go underground, fester, and lead to future violence.
1.3.11.2.1.1. Con: Oppressed groups that continuously face speech that undermines and further marginalises them, may not want to destroy ideas through discourse. Therefore, they may need spaces where they can discuss issues freely, instead of being burdened with educating others.
1.3.11.3. Pro: Universities and student organisations have a duty to protect students from harm.
1.3.11.3.1. Con: The majority of students at universities are adults. Therefore students do not need to be protected and universities should not take a paternalistic approach in fostering education.
1.3.11.3.1.1. Con: It is not a question of minors or adults. Any adult in the workplace should also be protected from hatred, vilification or discrimination.
1.3.11.3.1.2. Con: University faculty have a duty of care to their students. Protection is required because, although legally adults, the students are undergoing a formative process, which needs to be nurtured by their mentors.
1.3.11.3.1.3. Con: Refusing to give a platform to hate speech is not paternalistic.
1.3.11.3.2. Con: Students can easily protect themselves from "harm" by not attending the speech.
1.3.11.3.2.1. Pro: Humans have a responsibility to protect themselves, if they want to self preserve. Parents, teachers, etc have the responsibility to teach you how to protect yourself, but ultimately you must yourself act upon those principles.
1.3.11.3.3. Con: Offensive speech and "hate speech" does not fall under the category of "harm" for purposes of determining what obligations a university has. Universities might have the obligation to protect their students from physical harm; but they cannot and should not try to protect them from emotional harm.
1.3.11.3.3.1. Con: The harm in hate speech is more than just emotional harm. Rather, it can be taken \(as Jeremy Waldron [argues](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674416864)\) to harm the social fabric upon which public life in a pluralistic democracy depends.
1.3.11.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.9.5.1.
1.3.11.3.3.3. Con: Hate speech is robustly evidenced to produce psychological harms, such as stereotype threat. Even something like ‘benevolent sexism’ has been [evidenced](https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01311.x) to significantly decrease female achievement, has been used to justify unequal gender status relations and policy support, and is correlated with national gender inequality indexes \(Glick & Fiske, 1995\).
1.3.11.3.4. Con: If universities and student organizations have a duty to protect students from physical harm \(as when conservative speakers come to campus\), then they have a duty to prevent the possibility of physical harm by preventing and if necessary punishing the sort of extreme no-platforming activities that can lead to vandalism and assault.
1.3.11.3.5. Pro: Often these speakers which are being No-Platformed are known to passively aggressively try and provoke people who believe in norms, by obfuscating racist or other radical ideas within coded speech. This targeted provocation can put students at risk by causing violent counter protests/reactions. Any speaker who is so vitriolic as to potentially cause this violence would be best not allowed if not only for students' safety.
1.3.11.3.5.1. Pro: In an [article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/milo-yiannopoulos-is-the-walking-embodiment-of-bullst) written by The Daily Beast. It was reported how Milo Yiannopoulos, a person who is known to be "No Plaformed", would have private discussions which show he was aware of his inflammatory speech and how it troubled the populous. Further, his cohorts would emphasize that inflammatory speech should only skirt around and flirt with ideas of racism.
1.3.11.3.6. Con: There is arguably equal, if not greater long term psychological harm from believing its okay to censor someone for not agreeing with you. That's a terrible lesson to teach the future generations.
1.3.11.3.7. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.4.
1.3.11.3.8. Con: In some [instances](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/28/police-called-to-top-university-over-violent-anti-israel-protest/), the presence of controversial figures initially no-platformed but finally allowed to speak, has caused disturbance in campuses, even involving violence against students.
1.3.11.3.8.1. Con: This is not the speaker’s fault. The university should have provided the proper security measures.
1.3.11.3.8.2. Con: Universities already have security services to protect students. If a speaker is controversial, they should use their security or hire extra security for the event.
1.3.11.3.9. Pro: If inviting a controversial figure represents a significant [cost](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/ann-coulter-berkeley-speech.html) or if security cannot be guaranteed, universities should put their students’ interests and rights first.
1.3.11.3.9.1. Con: It is the audience, fully in control of their own actions, that causes the increase in cost or lack of guarantee of security, not the speaker.
1.3.11.3.9.2. Con: This is in essence a [heckler's veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler%27s_veto). You can silence speakers by threatening violence and disturbance and expect the university administration to cave.
1.3.11.3.9.3. Con: This is based on the assumption that the administration knows what is best for the students, or by proxy that the students know what is best for themselves. It can not be pre judged that the speaker will not be what is best for the students - that's prejudice.
1.3.11.3.9.3.1. Con: A reasoned pre-judgement is not inherently prejudice. Prejudice is judgement based on inherent bias, rather than any preemptive assessment.
1.3.11.3.9.4. Con: Insofar as a controversial speaker's presence will cause a danger of violent protests, the university should make a well-advertised habit of firmly disciplining those who protest violently and no-platform the speaker; over time, this will solve the problems of cost and physical security.
1.3.11.3.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.1.
1.3.11.3.10. Pro: Universities have campus security to help promote the safety and security of those on campus.
1.3.11.3.10.1. Con: It is not the job of campus security to protect the feelings of students \(i.e., against perceptions of vilification and hatred\), but against attacks on their physical safety and other law-breaking.
1.3.11.3.10.2. Con: Campus security does not enforce no-platforming done by students. If no-platforming were a harm of the sort that should concern campus security, then campus security would shut down the speech themselves.
1.3.11.3.11. Con: Being protected from physical harm, yes. We should not be protected from hearing dissenting opinions or ideas we don't like.
1.3.11.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.3.
1.3.11.5. Pro: Universities as places of knowledge transfer should be explicit about their political principles and defend them in their policies.
1.3.11.6. Con: There exists a false equivalency between physical safety/protection of individual rights and the emotional safety one perceives when avoiding ideas one dislikes. Of course campuses should be safe for all students, and discrimination should not be tolerated, but curating which ideas they hear is not equivalent to protecting them from violence or denial of liberty.
1.3.12. Con: Even if universities are themselves officially neutral much of the research that takes place there is not.
1.3.12.1. Pro: Universities generally decide where to allocate funds. Therefore, they can choose to fund research proposals that support their views and opt to not fund others that may challenge them.
1.3.12.1.1. Con: That universities can only fund research proposals that support their views does not necessarily mean that they should do so. Universities should adopt content-neutral methods for allocating resources based on impartial procedures.
1.3.12.1.2. Con: Much research that takes place at universities is funded by outside money. Similarly, if outside groups provide funds to bring a speaker to campus, that does not necessarily imply that they support those views.
1.3.12.1.2.1. Con: That is not the case for many countries, especially in Europe, where national and EU schemes constitute a big portion of the research funding. In the UK, one of the leaders in higher education, 68% of research [funding](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/leveragereport-pdf/) came from the public sector while only 14% came from charities and industry \(2013\).
1.3.12.1.2.1.1. Pro: Additionally, research in science can be easily monetised, thus receiving more private funding. Yet in many disciplines of social sciences, the knowledge created is less likely to generate revenues, therefore prone to be only publicly funded.
1.3.12.1.2.1.2. Pro: Even if scientific research has higher chances at private funding, in research that is too slow and complex or that produces valuable knowledge without direct applications to monetise it, [public](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10213582/Scientific-research-should-get-more-public-funding.html) funding is still key.
1.3.12.1.2.2. Pro: According to the OECD, [60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding_of_science#Private_funding)% of research and development funding comes from industry.
1.3.12.1.2.2.1. Con: However, the same source notes that the bulk of funding in the humanities and social sciences \(where the controversies that lead to no-platforming are likely to be located\) come from government and universities.
1.3.12.2. Pro: Research produced in areas such as the humanities and social sciences necessarily requires the academic to adopt a subjective approach when framing their analysis, eg an academic may take a feminist approach to the legal analysis of the criminal law. It is not possible for the academic to be entirely neutral in their research.
1.3.12.3. Con: Assuming that universities are themselves officially neutral, it does not matter if much of the research that takes place there is biased. The presence of biased research among faculty is more of a reason to permit bias from outsiders than it is to silence it.
1.3.13. Con: Not all universities claim to be neutral. For example, religious universities may take conservative approaches to the types of research permitted.
1.3.13.1. Con: While it is true that some universities are committed to certain views by their charters, it does not follow from that that other universities, in particular state universities and universities officially committed to free speech and academic freedom, are also so committed, or that they should be.
1.3.13.2. Con: Religious or other private universities are free to make exclusions because they are not publicly funded, thus they can devote their money \(and their students’\) to whatever they decide.
1.3.13.3. Pro: By the same token, non-religious universities have their own core missions and values and should be free to exclude research and speakers that are opposed to them.
1.3.13.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.13.2.
1.3.13.3.2. Con: If institutions receive any sort of public funding, then they should guarantee different visions and promote free speech.
1.3.13.3.2.1. Pro: The National Association of Scholars \(NAS\) recommends changes in legislation which would require colleges to guarantee First Amendment rights in order to receive [federal](https://www.nas.org/articles/the_freedom_to_learn_amendments_2.0) financial support.
1.3.13.3.2.2. Pro: In the US, some states such as [Arizona](https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2615/id/1387330) or [Texas](http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB02527I.htm) are passing bills to ensure free speech is guaranteed on campuses and [watchdog](https://goldwater-media.s3.amazonaws.com/cms_page_media/2017/2/2/X_Campus%20Free%20Speech%20Paper.pdf) organisations are proposing model legislation to the same effect.
1.3.13.3.2.3. Pro: Republicans in [Wisconsin](http://time.com/4759770/student-protests-republican-bill-expel/) are proposing a new law that will require students to be suspended or expelled if they are responsible for "interfering with the expressive rights of others." The bill also calls for universities to “remain neutral on public policy issues” and to be open to all speakers invited.
1.3.13.3.2.4. Con: This would only imply that no-platforming was wrong if no-platforming were found to be incompatible with free speech. But that is precisely what is in question.
1.3.14. Con: -> See 1.3.10.3.
1.3.15. Pro: Often the groups that no-platform represent status-quo views, meaning they have little to worry about if no-platforming becomes the norm. However, in the future the status-quo may change, and their views become minority positions. If this happens groups would come to regret normalising no-platforming as it would then be used against them by the ideological majority.
1.3.16. Con: There is no model for "neutrality" that's effective and practical. PR and "events" are often driven by provocation and spectacle. Many of these speakers are invited by campus special-interest groups. Producing a 'value-neutral' discourse would require an untenable amount of control by the universities, starting with research into what 'value-neutral' even means in the first place.
1.3.17. Pro: The only way we will progress as a society is by having an open exchange of ideas and reaching the conclusions of which work the best in a calm and rational manner. Banning people from speaking encourages mob mentality and echo chambers.
1.3.17.1. Pro: The most intellectually and technologically advanced cultures in history have also been more open to debate to a broader assortment of opinion. This was true of ancient Greece, Golden Age Islam, Renaissance Europe, and 20th century America.
1.3.17.2. Con: People are [unlikely to change their beliefs](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/27/opinion/sunday/youre-not-going-to-change-your-mind.html) upon being presented with evidence which contradicts it. As a result, a free exchange of ideas is not particularly likely to bring a community to the best conclusions.
1.3.18. Pro: State Run Universities are bound by the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause to provide equal \(neutral\) protection with respect to individuals and their ideas which are part of one's natural rights. [Campus Free Speech Act TN](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/110/Amend/SA0333.pdf)  [Schuette vs BAMN \(2014\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuette_v._Coalition_to_Defend_Affirmative_Action)[MUW v Hogan \(1982\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_University_for_Women_v._Hogan) and [US v Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Virginia)
1.3.18.1. Con: The act of no platforming is not outwardly a violation of equal protection, rather the prevention or cessation of contract agreement, which is well within the rights of any organization, public or private, to carry out.
1.4. Con: Universities should function as models for civic and civil discourse. Ideas which fall outside of the norms of proper civil discourse should be excluded from it.
1.4.1. Pro: No-platforming should always be an option, just as asking an unpleasant guest to leave your house is an option.  However, it should only be done to make room for opportunities of more productive dialogue, not to make our own perspectives the only ones platformed.
1.4.2. Pro: A considered use of no platform establishes, endorses &  enforces minimum standards. In effect it acts both as a licence and as setting out the terms for that licence. 'You must be at least this civil to present your views in our space.'
1.4.2.1. Pro: Uninhibited tolerance, seems to give rise if not encouragement to intolerance. Why feed the jaws that bite you?[Why feed the jaws that bite you?](https://www.facebook.com/PhilosophyMttrs/photos/a.305663529533101.58006.305644206201700/1227279930704785/?type=3&theater)
1.4.2.1.1. Con: The meme infographic conflates tolerance of a racist ideology in action \(e.g. the acting Nazi\) with any tolerance of someone holding a viewpoint that one personally perceives as preaching intolerance and persecution.
1.4.2.1.2. Con: The meme infographic is a purported summary of part of philosopher Karl Popper's arguments, but distorts his actual views. Karl Popper believed that intolerant speech should not be suppressed, but should be countered by rational argument and public opinion. His statement on not tolerating the intolerant was about the right to suppress [intolerant action even by force](https://fee.org/articles/why-the-paradox-of-tolerance-is-no-excuse-for-attacking-free-speech/).
1.4.2.2. Con: Many of the students and groups which have moved to disinvite a speaker or shout a speaker down have engaged in uncivil behavior such as [violence](https://qz.com/1082794/one-in-five-us-college-students-says-its-acceptable-to-use-violence-against-an-offensive-speaker/),[rioting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Berkeley_protests) and [skirmishes](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-berkeley-protests-20170827-story.html), [assault](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/03/04/middlebury/hAfpA1Hquh7DIS1doiKbhJ/story.html), [verbal assault](http://www.usforacle.com/news/view.php/1025969/ULS-lecturer-verbally-attacked-by-audien), and [disorderly conduct](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/03/04/middlebury/hAfpA1Hquh7DIS1doiKbhJ/story.html), which shows that standards of civility are not a main concern of those seeking to remove a platform from someone else.
1.4.3. Pro: In regards to myriad opinions that may be presented, fair and reasoned opinion must be given precedence over unfair and unreasonable opinion, the alternative is to be drowned in acerbic, dishonest and misinformed voices.
1.4.3.1. Con: Extremist views are, by definition, uncommon, and incapable of drowning out mainstream views.
1.4.3.1.1. Pro: The [Boston Free Speech Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Free_Speech_Rally) had roughly 50 demonstrators, only some of whom were extremist, and drew roughly 40,000 counterprotesters.
1.4.4. Pro: With a global population of approximately 7.6 billion people, societies must be discerning, lest knowledge is to be overwhelmed by billions of ignorant opinions.
1.4.5. Pro: All ideas are not equal.
1.4.6. Pro: The university should implement a diverse curriculum that includes different points of view and encourages students to be part of an inclusive and organized community where each actor \(students, teachers, workers\) is important and discrimination has no place.
1.4.7. Pro: It should be used much more judiciously than it is, but should not be abandoned altogether. Advocates for positions that are outside the Western democratic consensus speaking at Western universities makes about as much sense as flat Earth theorists lecturing in astronomy class. There is plenty of room for vigorous debate within our intellectual tradition, but advocates for things like white supremacy do not qualify.
1.4.8. Pro: Tolerance is a paradox. Being tolerant of, and allowing, intolerance, by giving it a platform, enables radical and/or intolerant ideals to spread.
1.4.9. Con: As such models, universities should promote pluralism and inclusion. As gatekeepers, they can actively set and enforce the norms of proper civil discourse that all speakers need to abide to, without being excluded.
1.4.9.1. Con: By the same token, no-platforming can be seen as an effective remedy when speakers fail to adhere to those norms.
1.4.10. Con: Understandings of what constitutes "norms of proper civil discourse" or "acceptable discourse" vary among people depending on their worldviews. There is not one definite or absolute way of defining such a discourse.
1.4.10.1. Pro: Shouting over others' speech to deny them a platform falls outside the norms of proper civil discourse.
1.4.10.2. Con: Discourses that promote hatred for reasons based on race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation can be labelled as uncivil, in the same manner [anti-discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-discrimination_law) and [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech) [laws](http://www.legal-project.org/issues/european-hate-speech-laws) manage to label what is unlawful.
1.4.10.2.1. Con: Anything can be labelled as uncivil. This is why rational communication is good and no platforming is bad.
1.4.10.2.2. Con: If the words are already unlawful, it would not be necessary to no-platform because the no-platforming would be preempted by the legal code.
1.4.10.2.3. Con: Who gets to decide what constitutes hateful? Speakers have been prevented in the past based purely on their political leanings. This will encourage echo chambers.
1.4.10.2.3.1. Con: It is possible to prevent certain kinds of speech without creating echo chambers.
1.4.10.2.3.2. Con: Some political views \(fascism, for example, or white supremacy\) are in fact hateful. It thus begs the question to assume that someone prevented from speaking purely based on their political leanings has been wrongly no-platformed.
1.4.10.2.3.2.1. Con: Some would argue that the far right hold similar political views to white supremacy, some even call them fascist. However, a correlation between similar individual policy isn't concrete proof to one's intent to harm.
1.4.10.3. Pro: The supposed "acceptable range" of ethical norms under which civil discourse "should" occur, is deeply ambiguous. The form of this range seems to depend almost entirely upon class, or on other social and cultural boundaries. In other words, once we refuse to communicate with those growing up in extremely different cultural circumstances, those outside of our bubble only grow more isolated and more extreme. One can't exorcize ideology by giving the cold shoulder. These views ARE norms for some.
1.4.10.3.1. Pro: The 1st Amendment is meant to protect unwanted speech. There was a time speech advocating for abortion, women's vote, black vote, LGBT rights, etc... was considered provocative. Unless people share new ideas and dissents what's the point? Agreeable speech doesn't need protection.
1.4.11. Con: [Critical thinking](http://conference.pixel-online.net/edu_future/common/download/Paper_pdf/SOE07-Fani.pdf) is one of the goals of modern education. Thus universities aim to create critical thinkers with curricular and extra-curricular activities. If students do not have the opportunity to challenge their views, they will not develop critical and analytical skills, necessary to rebut those ideas once they have left university.
1.4.11.1. Pro: According to [teachers](https://traue.commons.gc.cuny.edu/issue-2-fall-2013/davis/) and [publications](https://books.google.es/books?id=7crKen-nTvEC&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=critical+thinking+needs+%22challenging+views%22&source=bl&ots=-IhgJNRvDM&sig=SlESWd5P8Xce9wSkkaFfddW9_U4&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ2bLZwYvSAhXJWBoKHd2YDlwQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=critical%20thinking%20needs%20%22challenging%20views%22&f=false), challenging views are necessary to develop critical thinking.
1.4.11.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.11.
1.4.11.1.2. Pro: Institutions should instead teach students how to correctly discern truth from fiction, and react accordingly. Controversial speakers and their events can be prime opportunities for such discernment.
1.4.11.2. Con: -> See 1.2.11.
1.4.12. Con: If a speaker puts forward an idea which is racist or otherwise extreme, students will be able to challenge the ideas and engage directly with the discourse.
1.4.12.1. Pro: If students manage to oppose or publicly shame a racist speaker as a collective, they gain the opportunity to formulate concrete criticism directly to them and force them to defend themselves or apologize.
1.4.12.1.1. Con: However, this beneficial outcome only happens if the students manage to oppose the speaker which, in many cases, does not happen.
1.4.12.2. Con: The existing power relation between the invited speaker and the student - especially students who are themselves discriminated against by the speaker - might prevent them from challenging harmful statements.
1.4.12.2.1. Con: Most speakers \(especially at universities\) have a questions period where the exact purpose is to question the speaker on their beliefs and stances.
1.4.12.2.2. Con: The existing power relationship between students and speakers does not change by kicking them out. It tells students that if they don't like something they can have a protest and it'll all disappear. The power dynamic changes when the students in the existing system stand up and ask a question anyway, showing the other students that it's possible.
1.4.12.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.
1.4.12.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.5.1.
1.4.12.3. Con: Racist ideas should never be given a platform to be amplified.
1.4.12.3.1. Pro: Racist ideas have no foundation.
1.4.12.3.1.1. Pro: The allegedly scientific idea that some racial subgroups are superior than others has been [profoundly](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/01/racism-science-human-genomes-darwin) [refuted](http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-9-most-influential-works-of-scientific-racism-rank-1575543279).
1.4.12.3.2. Pro: Racist ideas are unfair and go against social justice.
1.4.12.3.2.1. Pro: [Gavan Titley](https://raster.fi/2016/02/17/the-debatability-of-racism-networked-participative-media-and-postracialism/)  has coined the term the 'debatability of racism' to describe how the challenge to prove the relevance of racism is used to suppress and deny discussions of race. This can also be extended to other forms of structural inequality.
1.4.12.3.2.2. Pro: The Universal [Declaration](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) of Human Rights, created by representatives from all over the world, states that “inherent dignity” and “equal and inalienable rights” belong to all members of the human race, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or any other differences.
1.4.12.3.3. Pro: Racist ideas are dangerous in society because they promote violence and hatred.
1.4.12.3.3.1. Pro: In the US, there has been a 6% increase in [hate](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/fbi-hate-crimes-muslims.html?_r=0) crimes during 2016, ranging from verbal attacks to serious physical harm.
1.4.12.3.3.2. Pro: After the debate over Brexit, which included several racist and oppressive positions, there has been a [42%](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/brexit-hate-crime-racism-stats-spike-police-england-wales-eu-referendum-a7126706.html) rise in [hate](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-eu-referendum-racial-racism-abuse-hate-crime-reported-latest-leave-immigration-a7104191.html) crimes  and racial abuse in the UK.
1.4.12.3.4. Con: If racist ideas have a platform, people may become aware that this discourse exists and organise against it.
1.4.12.3.4.1. Pro: This would weaken racist ideas.
1.4.12.3.4.2. Con: Universities are places of diversity. Promoting speakers that undermine the equality of rights for all with racist or sexist comments contradicts this enacted principle of diversity.
1.4.12.3.4.2.1. Con: By necessity, diversity requires entertaining the thought of the elimination of diversity, and then summarily rejecting it. No Platforming does not allow the thought to be entertained, and thus robs individuals of an important lesson in diversity.
1.4.12.3.4.2.2. Con: If the principle of diversity is to be protected in the long run, each generation of students needs to be equipped with the necessary skills to defend it in debate against opposing ideas.
1.4.12.3.4.2.2.1. Con: This does not require a platform for regressive ideologues. Just education.
1.4.12.3.4.2.3. Con: Speakers who have been labeled as racist, sexist, and anti-diversity are often not. Since there is no agreed upon measure for this, they should be allowed to speak and challenged by those who oppose them in a civil manner \(during Q&A, post-even write-ups, additional events etc.\)
1.4.12.3.4.2.4. Con: No-platforming actually decreases the diversity of thought students are exposed to by imbalanced application. Among disinvitation attempts  from [2016-2017](https://www.thefire.org/resources/disinvitation-database/#home/?view_2_sort=field_6|asc&view_2_page=15), 68 instances of no-platforming were instigated by students or groups more liberal than the speaker, yet only nine instances from groups to the right of the speaker.
1.4.12.3.4.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.1.3.
1.4.12.3.4.2.4.2. Con: The FIRE list is not an exhaustive list. It does not include, for example, [religious universities](https://www.thefire.org/resources/disinvitation-database/#home/?view_2_sort=field_6|asc&view_2_page=1&view_2_search=brigham%20young) such as Liberty and Brigham Young University using the threat of [prosecution](https://newrepublic.com/article/147908/invisible-free-speech-crisis) to keep peace and other left-wing activists off campus. Using it as evidence of "liberal bias" is therefore suspect.
1.4.12.3.4.2.5. Con: Universities are not places of diversity, they are places of learning.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6. Con: Diversity is not a simple reality but a principle that needs to be reclaimed within political debate over and over. Universities can provide a safe environment to reclaim diversity, even when they also invite controversial speakers opposing the benefits of diversity.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.1. Pro: Providing safe spaces with different positions contributes to diversity and there are enough different visions to debate without the need to include hate speech.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.1.1. Pro: Not all controversial speech is hateful.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2. Pro: Controversial speech should not be equated to hate speech. A discourse can be controversial without promoting hate.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1. Pro: It is difficult to draw a clear line showing at which point an individual or organisation has proven to be too offensive to be allowed a platform to speak. This makes it very difficult to create an effective no-platforming policy that is not arbitrary.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.1. Con: Ideas that purport damaging human dignity or the respect you owe others should be no-platformed. The way to determine this would be through analizing the principles of reason and freedom \(as outlined, for example, by [Kant](https://kantphilosophy.wordpress.com/kants-ethics/reason-and-freedom/)\) and whether a particular position damages the respect we owe to other humans
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.1.1. Con: The ideas of what is damaging to human dignity are very fluid and change greatly over time. It's easy to argue that civil rights, LGBT rights etc were at one time regarded as extremely damaging, but only speakers taking advantage of their right to offend most people were these causes advanced. It was open debate changing people's minds that has advanced the rights of various marginalised groups throughout history, not the prevention of it
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.1.2. Con: Many speakers hold views that may be interpreted by others, correctly or not, as being[damaging to human dignity](https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/opinion/a-culture-of-abortion-is-damaging-to-human-dignity-1-6840509) or [disrespectful to others](https://dailynorthwestern.com/2016/05/06/city/keynote-speaker-addresses-white-privilege-at-ywcas-first-racial-justice-summit/). If those were the benchmark, then it would become up to personal interpretations of what damages dignity or is disrespectful, and so would become difficult to find anyone to speak at a university on a controversial topic.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2. Pro: It should not be up to social justice movements to decide whether or not a speaker is granted a platform, because social justice movements are inherently political and therefore lack the independence to judge whether or not certain speech is harmful enough to be banned from being granted a platform.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1. Con: Social justice movements within campuses are made by students and students are the appropriate actors to decide who they invite to speak at their academic institutions.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Students are not appropriate actors to decide who cannot speak, as they have specifically enrolled in the University to learn and prepare for the workforce, and part of that learning is the [exposure to](https://www.harvard.edu/president/speech/2010/role-university-changing-world) and analysis of new and different ideas.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: The students should have the right to choose who they invite, but they should be strongly encouraged to consider and discuss opposing ideas and perspectives.  That's how we discover the best solutions.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Within public universities the common funding makes the government the appropriate decider. So long as speech is lawful it should be allowed.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.3. Con: The activist social justice students shouldn't get to decide for all students who should be allowed to speak. Of particular note is when a group of students invite a speaker.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4. Con: No-platformers do not speak for all members of their social group but act as if they were entitled to do so.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Advocacy groups don't need to speak for all members of a group. The more salient point is that they are seeking to minimize harm to particular groups.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Good intentions do not negate concerns about authoritarianism.  People may still wish to hear speakers with whom they disagree. Stopping these opportunities takes away agency from the people No-Platformers wish to protect, as much as the speakers themselves.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: In some instances, those students more vocal and mobilised impose their ideas on the other students, even when their views are not the majority.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.2.1. Pro: For example, Goldmiths feminist society voted to allow comedian Kate Smurthwaite's show. However, as a minority of students manifested they would take part in a picket against the event, it was eventually [canceled](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/02/goldsmiths-comedian-kate-smurthwaite-free-speech-show-feminist-campaigners).
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.3. Pro: Germaine Greer was no-platformed due to her discriminatory views on transgender women. However, trans academic Rachel Padman favoured giving her a [platform](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2015/10/what-row-over-banning-germaine-greer-really-about) to speak \(and to be questioned\). Even though Padman was directly affected by Greer’s views on transgender people: Greer tried to deny her access to an all-women’s university in the 90s.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.3.1. Con: While there were calls for Germaine Greer to be no-platformed, she was [not actually](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/05/boris-tatchell-greer-were-they-actually-no-platformed) no-platformed.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.4. Con: It is enough for no-platformers to speak for one minority group.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.5. Con: No-platformers usually base their request on an argument linked to a cause/minority. They seldom claim to speak in the name of all minorities.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.5.1. Pro: Some [students](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/opinion/a-controversial-speaker-comes-to-campus-what-do-you-do.html) claim that the history of racism and exclusion in the US cannot be ignored. Speakers that make minorities feel questioned or demeaned reinforce and legitimise the daily discriminatory experiences those students already have to endure.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.6. Pro: Trans women have showed [support](https://thequeerness.com/2017/01/21/im-a-trans-woman-and-i-believe-julie-bindel-should-be-heard/) to Julie Bindel \(who was no-platformed for her past transphobic views\) stating that she “has the right to argue \[her views\] in a respectful debate” .
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.7. Pro: Some students may prefer to confront controversial speakers and engage in an informed debate that discredits their point of view rather than no-platforming them.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.7.1. Pro: When No-Platformers act on behalf of an entire group of people, they take away the agency of members in that group who might wish to confront these ideas head on in a civil discourse.  As such, the liberties of those being "protected" are infringed as well as the liberties of those who would speak "hate."
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.2. Pro: Social justice platforms such as the Southern Poverty Law Center have been proven to do no or little research resulting in lost lawsuits and millions of dollars given to their victims[SPLC Pays $3.3 Million Settlement to Counter-Extremism Group It Called ‘Anti-Muslim’](https://www.thedailybeast.com/splc-pays-dollar33-million-settlement-to-counter-extremism-group-it-called-anti-muslim). Colleges and students implicitly trust such organizations doing no research themselves. This purposefully gives organizations like colleges and students bias against those not deserving of it.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.3. Con: There are rules that define [how](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Platform) the policy works.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.2.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.3.2. Pro: The No Platform policy, as defined in the National Union of Students \(NUS\)'s articles of association \(Item 7\), [provides](http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/resources/nus-uk-articles-and-rules-december-2016) that no "individuals or members of organisations or groups identified by the Democratic Procedures Committee as holding racist or fascist views" may stand for election to any NUS position, or attend or speak at any NUS function or conference.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.3.3. Pro: National Union of Student's articles of association [provides](http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/resources/nus-uk-articles-and-rules-december-2016) that officers, committee members, or trustees shall not share a platform with anyone known to be racist or fascist.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.3.4. Pro: The National Union of Students \(NUS\) has policy refusing platforms to people or organisations for specific reasons: the [NUS LGBT Campaign](https://web.archive.org/web/20131228085743/http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/pageassets/about/policy/LGBT_2012.pdf)  refuses platforms to those they consider to be transphobic, and the National Executive Committee has policy refusing a platform to those it considers to be rape deniers or rape apologists.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.3.5. Con: Even if no-platforming has rules that define when it can be applied, a potential speaker can veil their message behind slick rhetoric to circumvent the rules.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.3.6. Con: The rules of no-platforming beg the question of who can draw the line between right-wing and "fascist?" Or who can draw the line between a racist statement and a statement just about race.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.3.6.1. Con: Since no-platfoming takes place in specific institutions \(universities\), students are the ones to define and enforce those rules.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.3.7. Con: [These rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Platform) rely on the judgment of the "Democratic Procedures Committee", and also rely on objective and falsifiable definitions for the terms "racist" and "fascist". A reliance on a particular panel of people \(most of whom are young students, and not directly elected\) is arbitrary, and a lack of definition of key terms makes this rule incredibly unclear.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.4. Pro: No-platforming is indiscriminate mob justice. It is too easy for a single instigator to rile up a pitchfork crowd against any speaker with whom they disagree simply by labeling the speaker as racist or misogynist, regardless of the level of truth behind that claim.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.5. Con: There is a very clear line, to allow free speech or to violate it. "Too offensive" is subjective to the person reviewing and will never be able to be a consistent judgement.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.6. Con: Rules could be based upon harms evidenced empirically, such as the evidence for stereotype threat and/or ‘benevolent sexism.’ For example, the latter has been [evidenced](https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1995.tb01311.x) to significantly decrease female achievement, it has been used to justify unequal gender status relations and policy support, and it is correlated with national gender inequality indexes \(Glick & Fiske, 1995\).
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.7. Pro: At its core, restricting freedom of speech on the basis of 'hate speech' of vilification requires the burden of proof that words cause hurt and, a corollary, that there exists an absolute ethical worldview. Offence is a subjective state and to suggest causality does not explain why people have a range of reactions to the same 'hate speech' when they identify with that social group. With so much work being done to address resilience in youth this is retrogressive in its approach.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.8. Con: The power to decide difficult cases does not entail that the decision is arbitrary. One ought to be suspicious of the power to no-platform if the decision is opaque or if those who decide are otherwise unaccountable. These risks can be mitigated by democratic procedures of argument and voting which make decisions more likely to be justified than arbitrary.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.9. Con: It is important to distinguish ‘contentious’ speakers from bigots, fanatics and liars. Many of these people who claim to be ‘contentious’ or ‘controversial’ are in fact gleefully ‘punching down’—attempting to use the pretence of intellectual discussion to further marginalise or persecute a group of people.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.10. Pro: Who are we to elect to determine what is or isn't hate speech? In the United states we have the right to speech, this is not to say that we can tell fire in a theater if there isn't a fire. Non platforming needs to stop, listen, question and discuss opposing views using critical thinking.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.11. Pro: No-platforming can backfire by limiting the speech of moderate voices to the benefit of more extreme ones, if the no-platformers boycott or cede the event to the speaker they are protesting.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.11.1. Pro: For example in this [case](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/how-no-platforming-works--and-why-it-is-doomed-to-fail/) there were two speakers convened for a conference. Peter Thatchell had been non-platformed in the past, so Fran Cowling said she did not want to share a platform with him. When the university refused to no-platform Thatchell, he ended up being the only speaker as Cowling was unwilling to talk next to him.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.11.1.1. Con: The limitations of Cowling's moderate voice are questionable. Her absence may have been a notable 'presence' on stage at Canterbury Christ Church University. Moreover, her absence obligated some journalists to acknowledge the reasons for her refusal to appear on stage with Tatchell, thus amplifying her perspective rather than muffling it.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.12. Pro: No-platforming can happen solely because the speaker's views contradict the views of some students, in matters where different yet non-discriminatory views abound.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.12.1. Pro: The University of Cologne [disinvited](https://www.bioedge.org/bioethics/peter-singer-disinvited-from-german-philosophy-festival/11491) philosopher Peter Singer as students protested his controversial views on euthanasia of disabled infants, even though the scheduled talk was about animal liberation.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.12.2. Pro: [Condoleezza Rice](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/nyregion/rice-backs-out-of-rutgers-speech-after-student-protests.html?_r=0) refused to be a speaker after students protested her suitability due to her involvement in the Iraq war.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.12.2.1. Pro: The students missed an opportunity to hold her accountable and have a productive discourse about war, government actions and veracity.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.12.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.1.1.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.12.2.2. Con: There is a strong case to be made that Rice and other architects of the Iraq War are guilty of [war crimes.](http://war crimes.)  These allegations, and not any of her particular views, formed the reason for students at Rutgers to protest her invitation to be their commencement speaker.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.12.3. Pro: Students at [SOAS](http://theconversation.com/israel-no-platforming-and-why-theres-no-such-thing-as-narrow-exceptions-to-campus-free-speech-76907) wanted to no-platform Israel’s ambassador to the UK. When questioned about potential anti-Semitism, protesters assured they would equally protest against anyone from Iran or Saudi Arabia. However, no one protested when former Pakistani dictator Pervez Musharraf gave a speech.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.12.4. Pro: Goldsmiths feminist society, which “supports the sex industry”, told the comedian [Kate Smurthwaite](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/02/goldsmiths-comedian-kate-smurthwaite-free-speech-show-feminist-campaigners) that they would picket her show due to her views on decriminalising prostitution \(yet criminalising clients\). The show was eventually cancelled.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13. Con: No-platforming is not used excessively. In [2015](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36101423), none of the UK's 50 student unions exercised it. If they rarely use the policy, they are not using it abusively.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.1. Con: The policy can still be abused, regardless of how often it is used.  Excessive use may not even qualify as a form of abuse if there is a legitimate reason for each time it is used.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2. Con: Even if no-platform is not formally used, protests, dis-invitations or cancelations have prevented people from speaking.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1. Pro: An event in which two [men](http://freespeechdebate.com/en/discuss/no-platforming-on-university-campuses-political-correctness-and-the-subversion-of-free-speech/) were going to talk about abortion was cancelled after protests regarding the gender of the speakers.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.1. Con: The discussion was shut down as students considered it was not appropriate that two people without a [uterus](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/i-helped-shut-down-an-abortion-debate-between-two-men-because-my-uterus-isnt-up-for-their-discussion-9867200.html) could debate about reproductive rights that do not directly affect them.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.1.1. Pro: In a similar manner, institutions or students could find it inappropriate to have two white people discuss slavery, with no input from a person of African descent.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Yet it is common to hear a minority speaker discuss white privilege, or a woman discuss toxic masculinity, or an atheist speak about religious beliefs.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: That is exactly what has been proposed: that the recipients of violence and oppression get a chance to speak about it, not just the potential perpetrators. Minorities are the recipients of racial oppression which is linked to white privilege; women are the recipients of sexual discrimination and the underlying problems that toxic masculinity cause and atheist and non-believers are and have historically been affected by religious norms and even discrimination.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: In fact, historically, such discussions of issues that affected people of color by entirely white speakers or issues that affected women by male speakers were quite common.  Universities thus have an interest in making sure that this historical imbalance is not perpetuated.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.1.2. Con: If the problem was that the speakers were not directly affected by the policies debated, the students could have included more people with a uterus if they thought plurality and balance were missing.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.1.3. Con: As the speaker himself [mentions](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11239437/Oxford-students-shut-down-abortion-debate.-Free-speech-is-under-assault-on-campus.html), the notion that only someone affected by an issue can debate about it has no basis.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.1.4. Pro: In ethical debates, the power dynamics between different societal groups \(men/women, binary/non binary, heterosexual/queer, white/non-white…\) cannot be omitted, especially when certain groups have always had a platform to speak and act, and others have been oppressed.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.2. Con: In an [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11239437/Oxford-students-shut-down-abortion-debate.-Free-speech-is-under-assault-on-campus.html), one of the speakers explains the controversy by mocking feminist concerns about issues such as [cissexism](http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/03/everyday-cissexism/) or using expressions such as "by men I mean cisgendered heteronormative masculine pronouns in possession of a Hampton wick"; probably showing the reasons why he may have not been the most appropriate person to speak in the first place.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.2.1. Con: This is the exact reason why no-platforming is ineffective. Being an inappropriate speaker does not justify a ban.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.2.2. Con: This is a clear instance of overreaching in a policy that was designed to protect from oppressive speech, not from inappropriate speech.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.12.4.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.12.1.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.2.1.3.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.14. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.3.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15. Con: Even if some instances of no-platforming turn out to have been illegitimate, that does not delegitimise the entire tactic.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.1. Con: Inconsistent application of no-platforming is worse than not having the tactic at all, as some groups would be [allowed](http://freebeacon.com/culture/columbia-university-hosts-zionists-racists-forum/) to present potential hate speech or racism while other groups with perceived hate speech would be silenced, creating an imbalance of power and institutionalizing a form of racism within the culture.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2. Con: If there is even one instance where no-platforming illegitimately suspends someone’s right to free speech, the entire tactic is unacceptable.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.1. Pro: Freedom of speech is a fundamental human right and should only be infringed upon in cases where a speaker has proven to oppress others using their words.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.1.1. Pro: This is based on the same principle society uses as the basis for the justice system: stating that any person is innocent until proven guilty.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.1.1.1. Con: The law is not the predominantly applicable framework here. Irrespective of any legal argument, ethical reasons to exclude a person are sufficient as universities and their students have no legal obligation to invite speakers.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.1.1.2. Con: This is a standard specific to criminal law that does not extend to all instances of justice. For example, the standard of evidence in civil law is a "preponderance of evidence."
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.1.1.3. Pro: It is through this principle that we understand and follow [Blackstone's formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone's_formulation): "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer".
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.1.2. Pro: The right to protection from potential hate speech does not override innocent people's right to free speech.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.2. Con: Groups supporting no-platforming, for example the NUS, [argue](https://nusdigital.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/document/documents/31475/NUS_No_Platform_Policy_information_.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJKEA56ZWKFU6MHNQ&Expires=1494759067&Signature=Bav0NMfxuaYRJw82dtlc8Vxin1k%3D) that choosing whether or not to invite a speaker is an exercise of free speech in the first place.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.2.1. Con: If say the government chose to no platform those with whom the party disagrees with, using the same logic that too is an expression of free speech. This kind of thinking lays the groundwork for totalitarianism. Your ability to silence free speech is not an expression of your free speech, it an abuse of the power you hold.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.2.1.1. Con: The analogy between no-platforming efforts and government censorship fails because there is a relevant difference between state power and the collective action of private citizens. Free speech protections restrict the former and not the latter.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.2.2. Pro: In fact, giving someone a platform is a form of speech/expression. Thus, saying that organizations are obligated to provide platforms for ideas they disagree with is a violation of the organization's right to free expression.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.2.2.1. Pro: The National Union of Students [justify](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nusdigital/document/documents/14291/59f16f01802bb0a1228652fc7de986bb/Implementing%20No%20Platform%20policies.pdf) the 'no platform' policy as an exercise of free speech by students because they say '\[students\] should be free to decide who they should and should not invite to speak on platforms at their events'.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.2.2.1.1. Con: In this context, the speaker has already been invited by students, and a different group of students is no-platforming that speaker.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.3. Pro: It is possible to limit the grounds on which no-platforming becomes legitimate to prevent it from going too far. This means that people can be protected from hate speech, and people who have done nothing to be silenced get to keep their right to free speech intact.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.3.1. Con: The precise problem is that pinpointing what may be offensive and thus labelled as hate speech is not easy \(especially beforehand\), therefore being able to guarantee free speech in legitimate cases is not that simple.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.3.1.1. Pro: It is because of this reason that no-platforming policy is destined to either be so ineffective that it has no significant impact, or become overreaching and therefore a harmful attack on free speech.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.2.1.3.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.2.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.3.4. Pro: The National [Union](http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/resources/implementing-no-platform-policies) of Students [considers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36101423) that their policy "does not limit free speech, but acts to defend it by calling out violence, hate speech, bullying and harassment, which allows debate to take place without intimidation".
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.3.4.1. Con: This argument may be valid, but it ignores all the different types of no-platforming.  Consider recent examples of Global Warming skeptics. Which category above would this fit? Furthermore, some of the above descriptors can be subjective.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.16. Pro: No platforming can happen because the speakers are judged "not inclusive enough," even though they have not directly perpetrated offense or harm.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.16.1. Pro: A private college in Massachusetts [cancelled](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/16/vagina-monologues-mount-holyoke_n_6487302.html) a performance of The Vagina Monologues that was being hosted as a fundraiser for the V-Day campaign \(a nonprofit organisation that works to end violence against women and girls globally\) due to criticism that the play was not inclusive enough of trans women.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.16.2. Con: The point of no-platforming is not to punish individuals, but rather to set standards about what defines acceptable discourse in society.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.16.2.1. Con: There is no discourse if people don't let each other speak.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.16.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.10.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.16.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17. Pro: No-platforming can be abused by the powerful to silence the speech of the minority.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17.1. Pro: In the case of some persecuted ex-Muslims, being denied a platform to explain the cause of their departure from the faith further persecuted them for trying to discuss real issues with middle eastern culture for fear of appearing outwardly offensive.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.3.5.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.3.6.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17.4. Pro: By definition, 'No Platforming' is the more powerful silencing the speech of the minority.  That is exactly what it means. The supposition of abuse is not necessary. All exercise of power to silence is abuse since it is the belief in and exercising of Intellectual and/or Moral Supremacy and the power of veto over another.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17.4.1. Con: Students are rarely considered to be powerful actors within a society; they only excise power within a relatively confined space \(i.e. the University\). In comparison, no platformed speakers are often powerful politicians or figures with a media presence that affords them access and reach in almost all other areas.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17.4.1.1. Con: Students are only actors within relatively confined space \(ie: the University\). The broader public is not applicable here since student power is generally most concentrated and dominate in the confined space ie: university.  'No platforming' is the presumption and exercising of power to silence. If these speakers are allowed platforms outside the university, then it is the students who are abusing their concentration of power.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17.4.1.2. Con: Professors and the academy have tremendous access and reach outside the university. Students \(particularly graduates\) take an active part in the dissemination of academic thought and leadership on society at large  Students who are isolated from exposure to ideas from outside their confined space will evidently imposes bias and bigoted thought on society from leadership roles.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17.4.1.3. Con: Students who learn to exercise power dominance over another within their confined space of power will graduate and exercise the same abuse of power in their future confined spaces of power \(ie workplace, government employee, policy maker, etc\).
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17.4.1.4. Con: Students who graduate are nearly always considered to be powerful actors within a society as they are deemed "educated".  In most cases, the university is the gateway to power within society. "Student" is a temporary title bestowed on those seeking higher knowledge, greater exposure and social responsibility. 'No platform' is contrary to the title of "student" and leader.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17.5. Pro: The issue with "No-Platforming" is the fact that its very existence as a concept relies on accepting the notion that somebody, somewhere, decides who is and isn't allowed to speak. The only reason some people support it today is because they think only their enemies will be silenced, but they have no idea who will be silenced tomorrow once that door is open.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.18. Con: This is basically a slippery slope argument, a common fallacy.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.18.1. Con: A slippery slope argument on this topic would be a claim that no-platforming some speakers would necessarily lead to no-platforming many speakers for the tiniest of reasons or to rampant censorship. Claiming that ambiguous definitions and lines make it hard to craft effective policy does not fit the model of a slippery-slope argument.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.18.2. Con: A slippery slope logical fallacy only holds if the conclusion is absurd. In this case, it is evidenced. A vocal minority can decide what is deemed "offensive" \(a state which is completely unfalsifiable\), therefore effective censorship of contrary ideas can be easily achieved on University campuses. If an idea is rational and robust it can endure in the face of ideological opposition. No-Platforming is an effective means of protecting weak or dangerous ideas from scrutiny.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.18.3. Con: This is not a slippery slope argument as it is not suggesting a possible escalation of a situation. It is rather focusing on the nuance of the question in admitting that there is no binary position or conclusion to draw.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.18.4. Con: One could argue that the principle of "legitimization of hate speech" falls back on the slippery slope fallacy. Certainly not all prejudiced speakers effectively propagate the beliefs that they espouse. Case in point, Lucian Wintrich's visit to Bard College was met with relatively sterile and analytical observation from a predominantly hostile audience.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.18.5. Con: A "slippery slope" argument is not necessarily fallacious.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.19. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.3.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.20. Pro: The main problem with the justification of "no platforming" on grounds of racism, sexism, etc. is that these concepts themselves no longer have a set definition. By organizing protests to block speech from controversial speakers on the grounds of racism and sexism, the protesting group predetermines what sexism and racism is and no longer lets whoever hears the speech decide for themselves whether something is acceptable or not.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.20.1. Pro: There is no longer a clear and set definition of [racism](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/racism) that is widely agreed upon in the culture, as many modern writers and groups have proposed it can be [re-defined](https://medium.com/\@OnlyBlackGirl/your-dictionary-definition-of-racism-is-outdated-trash-66363903d9a6) at will, whether [culturally](https://paintingthegreyarea.wordpress.com/2014/07/03/the-evolving-definitions-of-racism-and-why-theres-no-reverse/) or by [updating dictionary definitions](http://affinitymagazine.us/2017/02/19/dear-white-people-your-dictionary-definition-of-racism-is-wrong/), in whatever way needed to support a social justice group's agenda.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.20.1.1. Con: There is in fact a clear [definition](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/race/) of race largely agreed upon by  as to what constitutes a notion of race \(and by extension racism\), and this definition emphasizes its continuity since the development of the concept of race in the modern era.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.20.1.2. Con: Proposing that changes to a concept such as racism in light of better information and theory amounts to "re-defining at will" sets up a [strawman](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/169/Strawman-Fallacy) version of the concept. Like all strawmen, even if there prove to be problems with this strawman, it doesn't provide reasons to reject more robust, nuanced version of the concept.
1.4.12.3.4.2.6.3. Pro: Driven by feminist and LGBTQ activists, the NUS no-platform policy [expanded](http://kcsu.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/CD5_SocCit_motion-1.pdf) \(NUS 2015, p.49\) beyond racism and fascism to include misogyny and transmisogyny advancing the Union's understanding of the types of diversity to be protected by the policy.
1.4.12.3.4.2.7. Con: Universities are not necessarily places of diversity. In fact, historical and prestigious ones like Oxford and Cambridge were specifically created to educate elites and they very much [continue](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/06/the-oxbridge-whitewash-black-students) to do so.
1.4.12.3.4.2.7.1. Con: Even elite institutions have the aspirational goal of inclusiveness as evidenced in various [access](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2012-09-10-pembroke-college-launches-new-access-initiatives) initiatives.
1.4.12.3.4.2.7.1.1. Con: Access initiatives are only a patch: the lack of inclusion in these elite institutions has existed for centuries. Most accepted students continue to come from only [five](http://oxfordstudent.com/2014/08/08/access-initiatives-more-important-now-than-ever/) schools nationwide, year after year.
1.4.12.3.4.2.7.2. Con: Cambridge University [claims](http://www.equality.admin.cam.ac.uk/) to be a diverse institution. This contradicts the idea that it continues to focus on educating elites.
1.4.12.3.4.2.7.2.1. Con: Even if the University claims to be a diverse place, in [practice](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/01/top-universities-not-to-blame-for-lack-of-diversity-say-state-headteachers) this does not seem to be true.
1.4.12.3.4.2.8. Pro: Diversity is often voiced in official statements to be a core principle in universities, such as in [Yale](https://your.yale.edu/community/diversity-inclusion), [Berkeley](http://diversity.berkeley.edu/principles-community) or [Harvard](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/human-resources/policies-and-procedures/diversity-statement-and-equal-employment-opportunity). Improvements are monitored with [programs and initiatives](https://www.aacu.org/resources/diversity-equity-and-inclusive-excellence).
1.4.12.3.4.2.9. Con: A diversity of ideas is an important pillar of universities. Students have to be given the opportunity to not only learn about the hateful speech that exists, but they should be given a chance to refute those ideas while under the safety net of a university.
1.4.12.3.4.2.9.1. Con: No-Platforming is a form of refuting those ideas.
1.4.12.3.4.2.10. Con: This is not a valid con against stopping no-platforming. No diversity is protected when students are not even allowed the choice of what not to think with, or against.
1.4.12.3.4.2.10.1. Con: This is a straw-man version of no-platforming. No-platforming does not seek to disallow student's from having a choice in what they think. Rather, it seeks to block the spread of racist and fascist views.
1.4.12.3.4.2.11. Con: The obvious \(and unfortunate\) argument is that diversity flows both ways: letting someone deprive someone else of their right to speak is a move against diversity, even if their speech is against diversity.
1.4.12.3.4.2.11.1. Con: The "[paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance)" states that a society can only be tolerant if it refuses to tolerate intolerance.
1.4.12.3.4.2.12. Con: Racist or sexist comments do not actually undermine the equality of rights for all or contradict the principle of diversity. The university remains a place of diversity whether someone makes a racist comment or not and the equality of rights for all remains intact whether someone makes a racist comment or not.
1.4.12.3.4.2.13. Con: Anti-diversity speakers exist whether or not they are platformed. One's alignment with principles of diversity is unrelated to whether they platform anti-diversity speakers. Only by platforming such speakers can people be prepared to rationally refute their ideas.
1.4.12.3.4.2.13.1. Con: One-sided messages won't teach anyone how to rationally refute ideas. For that, a balance of differing viewpoints would need to be represented.
1.4.12.4. Con: -> See 1.2.8.5.
1.4.13. Pro: The norms of civil discourse still provide a broad range within which reasonable differences of opinion and perspective can be debated, serving the goals of critical thinking and self expression. Extremism is not required for dialogue.
1.4.14. Pro: Not allowing a hateful group to organize and speak is different than listening to opposing views - no-platforming shows what kind of community the university will support.
1.4.14.1. Con: Hate is the ultimate opposition having infinite ways of masquerading itself and seeping into minds; one does not begin to recognise it by limiting student's exposure to any of its masks.
1.4.15. Con: The academic realm relying on exclusion as an operating principle may be a powerful fuel for the kind of isolation and anger that has been gestating in these distinctive subcultures which already view the realm of intellectualism as exclusive and elitist. The rural anti-intellectual feels as if their very existence is de-legitimized when the views they actually truly hold are dismissed outright, without being engaged or deconstructed.
1.4.16. Pro: It is the responsibility of a democratic public sphere not to promote fallacious, hateful views as if they have the same inherent weight as any other perspective. White supremacists, for instance, speak from a position that is both ethically and intellectually untenable. Public institutions should not pretend otherwise by giving such views air-time.
1.4.17. Pro: No-platforming needs to be studied, not abandoned. Universities are a breeding grounds for both healthy and unhealthy ideas for society. Identifying patterns across universities for which issues warrant no-platforming would illuminate which specific ideas are considered too hateful for wide dissemination.
1.4.17.1. Con: It is unwise to look to universities for patterns to apply more broadly. This is because universities are composed of far younger populations, whose opinions are not necessarily mature. It is far wiser to determine the palatability of an idea by opening it to public analysis and discourse - and this can only be done when it is possible for any idea to be broadcast.
1.4.18. Con: A university may function as a model for civic/civil discourse, while still allowing the discussion of ideas which fall outside civil norms. People's views on things change. Things that were once thought to be uncivil have become acceptable, and we call this progress. When a university bans discussion of uncivil ideas, this progress is stifled.
1.4.18.1. Pro: Civil and proper behavior should be the guiding principle of debate and speeches. For example, like in chess and other competitions, opponents shake hands to open and close.
1.5. Pro: Justice which depends on refusing to hear another party is not justice at all. It is totalitarianism.
1.5.1. Con: Totalitarianism is actually a system of government in which persons are forced to imbibe extremist views against their will. In a democratic society, persons \(regardless of background\) are allowed to choose which arguments to listen to, based for instance on whether or not those arguments are reasonable or persuasive, or on other criteria that are freely chosen.
1.5.1.1. Con: Refusing to allow a segment to the common forum is to treat that segment unjustly whether or not it is hyperbolic to call this totalitarian.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Totalitarianism is a mode of governing that prohibits opposition parties, restricts individual opposition to the state and its claims, and exercises an extremely high degree of control over public and private life. It is regarded as the most extreme and complete form of authoritarianism. You have the right to not listen to a speaker you disagree with, but you do not have the right to keep others from hearing it.
1.5.2. Con: This rhetoric making claims about what constitutes justice is unsubstantiated. Justice is a complex concept, and possibly extremely contextually dependent.
1.6. Con: No-platforming is a valid way to exercise free speech and counterbalance power asymmetries.
1.6.1. Con: It depends whether or not one believe free speech and power should be mutually exclusive. If someone beIieves they shouldn't, it might be more of a semantic issue.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Providing a free speech platform isn't necessarily the best way to have a rational discussion.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Not all platforms have to be free speech platforms but those that are shouldn't be allowed to moderate the speech as this runs counter to the idea of free speech. Free speech is important and deserves a space but is not always a useful focus point in rational discussions.
1.6.1.3. Pro: Free speech is by its nature unrestricted and so anyone providing a free speech platform should be aware that the views expressed through that platform are entitled to be offensive.
1.6.1.4. Con: The First Amendment protects people's free speech from government interference, especially in public forums. [Universities](http://www.newseuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-speech-2/free-speech-on-public-college-campuses-overview/campus-speakers/) \(even if publicly funded\) are found to be [limited public forums](http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Freedom+of+Speech). And, as it is their own members, not the government, who no-platform, the policy cannot be seen as an attack to the First Amendment.
1.6.1.4.1. Con: There is extensive US jurisprudence regarding free speech on [public](https://www.thefire.org/in-court/state-of-the-law-speech-codes/) universities: judges conclude that it should not be protected any less than in other instances.
1.6.1.4.1.1. Con: Most of those rulings are based on university officials or administrators limiting the students’ free speech rights \(e.g. distributing a flyer, publishing a newspaper or forming an official group\). None of those cases deal with students freely deciding to invite, un-invite or boycott an external speaker.
1.6.1.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.8.
1.6.1.4.2. Pro: Universities can deny invitations \(if the speaker advocates disruptive action against the institution\) and are also allowed by the US Constitution to regulate when and where an external speaker is allowed to speak. They can even impose reasonable content-based [restrictions](http://www.newseuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-speech-2/free-speech-on-public-college-campuses-overview/campus-speakers/), as long as they are unbiased and can apply to everyone.
1.6.1.4.2.1. Pro: For example, the Supreme Court established that “the First Amendment does not guarantee access to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government”. However, reasonable restrictions in time, place and manner are permitted \(Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, [1983](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/460/37/)\).
1.6.1.4.3. Con: The First Amendment prohibits Congress from establishing laws that abridge freedom of speech or the people's right to peacefully assemble.  The 14th Amendment ensures the States cannot abridge a citizen's rights or immunities "nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." A State University/College is an entity of State government and subject to 14th Amendment
1.6.1.4.4. Con: Free speech is a unabridgable right.
1.6.1.4.4.1. Pro: Free speech is a natural right.
1.6.1.4.4.2. Pro: Natural rights cannot be abridged.
1.6.2. Con: It is unclear why free speech platforms should  necessarily address power imbalances. Not to say there shouldn't be other platforms which do.
1.6.3. Con: Shouting down opposing views or preventing them from being presented is a form of censorship. To call silencing others free speech is cynical at best.
1.6.4. Con: In many predominantly liberal universities, liberal ideas and voices already possess near-total power.  Thus to act as a "counterbalance to power asymmetries" in many universities would require funding only conservative voices and silencing liberal ones.
1.6.4.1. Con: There is substantial [evidence](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/02/deconstructing-the-liberal-campus-cliche/516336/) that the claim of a uniformly liberal academy misdescribes the present state of the academy.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Christian colleges, which far outnumber the elite colleges usually focused on by critics of no-platforming, regularly [suppress](https://newrepublic.com/article/147908/invisible-free-speech-crisis) the speech of pacifists and other left-wing groups.
1.6.5. Con: Removing a person's ability to speak at an event is not a valid way to excercise free speech. It quite literally removes free speech.
1.6.6. Con: Power games reframe society as wholly competitive, and collaborative only within groups. This contributes to every kind of prejudice a social justice advocate would wish to avoid. Free speech should not be considered a matter of power.
1.6.7. Pro: No-platformed speakers usually are well established in their field. If they get a platform, those who feel attacked by their speech may not have a platform as 'loud' to propose alternative points of view.
1.6.8. Pro: People who object to being no-platformed themselves, would [no-platform](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/if-you-dont-like-no-platforming-maybe-its-you-whos-the-special-snowflake-a6884026.html) other speakers who they don't agree with. If they don't see that when other people's speech is limited as a threat to freedom of speech, they should accept when it happens to them.
1.6.8.1. Con: [Ben Shapiro](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/14/us/berkeley-ben-shapiro-speech/index.html), who has show concern for free speech when several student groups tried to no-platform him, has also [criticized](http://www.dailywire.com/news/22301/dumb-maga-hatted-trump-supporters-shout-down-ben-shapiro) right-wing protestors for no-platforming their political opponents.
1.6.8.2. Con: No-platforming someone who no-platforms others doesn't make no-platforming right.
1.6.8.3. Pro: Milo Yiannopoulos has shown concern for free speech when he has been no-platformed, claiming he should be able to express his controversial ideas, yet he is [protesting](http://forward.com/fast-forward/371641/milo-yiannopoulos-headlines-pamela-gellers-cancelsarsour-protest/) against Palestinian-American political activist Linda Sarsour being a [speaker](http://forward.com/fast-forward/370080/pro-palestinian-activist-linda-sarsour-picked-to-speak-at-cuny-graduation/) at a New York university.
1.6.8.3.1. Con: Protesting against a speaker or his opinion is different from enforcing no-platforming. The first one being the expression of ones own opinion the second one is the prevention of the expression of the opinion of another person.
1.6.8.3.1.1. Con: Yiannopoulos was clearly supporting the [cancelation](http://forward.com/fast-forward/371641/milo-yiannopoulos-headlines-pamela-gellers-cancelsarsour-protest/) of Sarsour’s speech. Therefore he was not only expressing his opinion but effectively advocating to prevent her from speaking, which is arguably the same as enforcing no-platforming.
1.6.9. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.17.
1.6.10. Pro: No-platforming champions the right to exist free from harm.
1.6.10.1. Con: No, it champions the right to live in an echo chamber, hearing only the sound of your own voice and those who think identically.   There is no value to a 'liberal education' if, in actuality, it means an education where one has never heard more than one viewpoint.
1.6.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.
1.6.10.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.2.
1.6.10.4. Pro: People that feel attacked by hateful speech may be unable to report it due to existing power imbalances. This may prevent students from complaining altogether, leaving them in a situation of vulnerability.
1.6.10.4.1. Pro: Universities often are hesitant to critique established thinkers in their fields because they want to avoid controversy, to the detriment of the affected students.
1.6.10.4.2. Pro: Organization's like Harvard's "Libertarian Forum" [advocate](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/4/18/hate-speech-libertarians/) the absolute right to free speech, including the right to hate speech. This can create an unsafe campus environment, where people who report hate speech are shamed for speaking out.
1.6.10.4.2.1. Con: Universities can prevent this by assuring debates in which extreme speech is showcased are moderated, and that speakers with opposing views present their arguments in the same event making sure particular audiences will hear a plurality of voices.
1.6.10.4.2.1.1. Con: If a speaker with extreme ideas against minorities is able to express them, even if it is in an environment where opposing views are discussed, those ideas still impact students, making the campus unsafe or decreasing the chances that students report abuse.
1.6.10.4.2.1.2. Con: 'Events that rely on inflammatory speakers are not intended to encourage genuine, non-oppressive dialogue but to attract an audience. This can legitimate bigotry, as such views are, in effect, treated as equal and subject to the same terms and conditions as other positions' \([O'Keefe](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/fr.2016.7), p.88\).
1.6.10.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: When a group of students deliberately invite a controversial figure \(with a history of hate speech against all sorts of minorities\) just to spur [tension](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2017/02/21/if-college-liberals-are-so-naive-why-did-the-campus-right-fall-for-yiannopoulos/?utm_term=.666c4123c883#comments) and division, it is not ideas or debate that they are interested in but the publicity and generating anger.
1.6.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.5.1.
1.6.10.6. Con: Giving ideas \(even difficult ones\) a platform cannot reasonably be viewed as doing "harm".
1.6.11. Pro: Abandoning no-platforming leads to a [false balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance) in university debates in which unfounded ideas are given the same validity as ideas substantiated by scientific consensus.
1.6.11.1. Con: Scientific consensus could be perceived as a power imbalance by dissenters in the scientific community, even if their science is not valid.
1.6.11.2. Con: Some no-platforming movements have specifically targeted speakers that promoted theories and viewpoints founded on data and analysis that are not [outside mainstream science](http://www.aei.org/publication/an-open-letter-to-the-virginia-tech-community/), but are[politically controversial](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/09/06/some-harvard-students-protest-charles-murray-speech/?utm_term=.b693b154ac72) to the students and groups wanting them silenced.
1.6.11.2.1. Con: That Charles Murray would self-describe his views as "not outside mainstream science" is unsurprising but is irrelevant to whether or not his views actually fall outside of mainstream science. In fact, the [scientific](https://newrepublic.com/article/97484/the-end-nature-v-nurture) consensus has decisively [debunked](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/5/18/15655638/charles-murray-race-iq-sam-harris-science-free-speech) Charles Murray's work and the modern attempt to revive the concept of race.
1.6.11.2.1.1. Pro: As recently as March 30, 2018 63 prominent scholars and sciences from across the natural and social sciences published an [open letter](https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfopinion/race-genetics-david-reich?utm_term=.wgEqDryRR#.hrw7qeWAA) denouncing the claim that the resurgence of the biological concept of race promoted by Murray and others had any basis in the science.
1.6.11.2.1.1.1. Con: 67 scholars and scientists speaking against one book is not reflective of scientific consensus, just that there is at least some controversy on an issue.
1.6.11.2.1.1.1.1. Con: To say that a wide range of recognized experts do not reflect scientific consensus in their open letter but merely establishes "controversy" misunderstands the clearly stated [nature](https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfopinion/race-genetics-david-reich?utm_term=.wgEqDryRR#.hrw7qeWAA) of the claim being made:
"For several decades billions of dollars have been spent trying to find such differences. The result has been a preponderance of negative findings despite intrepid efforts to collect DNA data on millions of individuals in the hope of finding even the tiniest signals of difference."
1.6.11.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The opinion article in Buzzfeed about a different author, David Reich, is speaking about the scientific fact that there is only one race \(human\) and no DNA discovery has refuted that; not that Murray's tracking of biologic differences between geographic and ethnic groups has not been[backed by DNA evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4687076/), as that has been [tracked and studied](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25517/).
1.6.11.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This "Opinion article in Buzzfeed" was an open letter written and signed by dozens of prominent academics. As such, its claims about the lack of scientific basis for a resurgence in the biological notion of racism constitute a warranted argument from authority.
1.6.11.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The claim they are refuting is not the claim that Murray was making. They are refuting the idea that there is more than one race amongst humanity \(e.g. different types of humans\); Murray was tracking IQ and other genetic differences between ethnic-geographical groups \(e.g. blacks living in continent vs. another, East Asians vs. west, etc.\)
1.6.11.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: [Over 30,000 scientists](http://www.petitionproject.org/qualifications_of_signers.php), including 37 specializing in climate science, and about 4,000 from atmospheric, environmental, and Earth sciences, have stated that they [do not believe](http://www.petitionproject.org/) there is enough scientific evidence to prove man is contributing to climate change vs. other factors; this shows that there is controversy on the issue, but it does not show that all scientists agree that there is no evidence for anthropogenic global warming.
1.6.11.2.1.1.2. Con: The 67 scientists do not provide any evidence to refute the data in David Reich's book; rather their objection is based on there being no clear interpretation of the data provided in the book which they personally believe, without provided basis, to be an intentional hope on Reich's part that readers will misinterpret the data to think that one race is superior to another.
1.6.11.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Claiming that 67 scientists signing a letter discussing *widespread scientific consensus* amounts to nothing more than "personal beliefs" misunderstands how in this case an [argument from authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority#Appeals_to_authorities) is being made to establish what counts as inside or outside of the scientific mainstream by an incredibly wide range of acknowledged experts on that question.
1.6.11.2.1.1.3. Con: The 67 scientists are responding to a book by geneticist David Reich, not to Murray or specifically to his work.
1.6.11.2.1.1.3.1. Con: While the specific target of the open [letter](https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfopinion/race-genetics-david-reich?utm_term=.wgEqDryRR#.hrw7qeWAA) under discussion is Reich, the authors make it clear that the target is the general revival of the biological concept of race \(which Murray's work [relies](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1994/12/01/the-tainted-sources-of-the-bell-curve/) heavily on\), and specifically attacking the notion that the biological concept of race has any scientific basis.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4. Con: There is nothing in the scientifically accurate explanation of the 67 scholars and scientists that really is only one human race, that average genetic differences based on geographic locations or ethnic groups change over time and are hard to map, or that there are genetic differences that cannot be traced to ethnicity or location, that would demand the work of Charles Murray on tracking biologic differences must be interpreted as  unscientific.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1. Con: In fact, Murray's work has been shown to [rely](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1994/12/01/the-tainted-sources-of-the-bell-curve/) heavily on the biological concept of race.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: As the article explains, Murray's data is not in any scientific dispute and is pulled from reputable and neutral sources, nor are the book's central claims in dispute, nor do they dispute that intelligence is heritable. The only dispute is on how some data may be interpreted and on their disagreement with Murray's personal ideas on social policies based on the data.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: Saying that the only thing in dispute is some of Murray's "personal interpretations" and not the underlying science is a mischaracterization of the way in which the Bell Curve has been [debunked](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1994/12/01/the-tainted-sources-of-the-bell-curve/): "And many of The Bell Curve’s most important assertions which establish causal links between IQ and social behavior, and IQ and race, are derived partially or totally from the Mankind Quarterly—Pioneer Fund scholarly circle. " \[[The Pioneer Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Fund) is a debunked white supremicist, eugenicist group\].
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2. Con: The article specifically admits that "Most of The Bell Curve does not explicitly address the relationship between race, genes, and IQ—as Murray has taken great pains to point out." It tries to build a guilt-by-association case by pointing out that some of his sources were printed in a magazine that was known in the 60's and 70's for promoting racism and eugenics.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: That "most of a book" does not address a certain topic does not mean that the topic is irrelevant to the book: indeed, it ignores those parts central to the controversies that surround the Bell Curve, which is what are under discussion in this debate.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: The article does not give a single example of a comment it finds racist in the book, and admits that Murray does not explicitly state anything to the effect of blacks being lower IQ than whites, etc. Rather, the article claims that because Murray showed data correlating IQ with social class, and because Murray showed data that IQ is heritable, then they personally believe Murray must be insinuating that blacks are lower IQ because blacks are more likely to be poor.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.2. Con: Showing that central parts of the books controversial claims rely on evidence from a particular source, is not "guilt by association," but rather is a core way in which an assertion is rejected.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.1. Con: A journal article or study is not from a monolithic source. Articles can be written by many different contributors over time. The National Geographic has printed articles in the past that it, but that does not mean that every article ever written is tainted by racism or that every observation or point of data is automatically false because of potential racist connections.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.3. Pro: Charles Darwin believed there were many races and that his theory of evolution backed up the caucasian race being superior, as laid out in "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the [Preservation of Favoured Races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species) in the Struggle for Life," and more in depth in "The Descent of Man," but no one would reasonably claim that every evolutionist practicing today is tainted by using any of Darwin's work as a source.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.3.1. Con: Darwin's Origin of Species, had nothing at all to say about human evolution specifically,  but was rather a general theory of natural selection in which Darwin took [pains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species#Human_evolution) to focus on non-human examples. To conflate the term "favoured races" with the use of race as applied in biological racism, or to assume that any part of the argument of the Origin of Species relied on \(or even mentioned\) the idea of a Caucasian race, is to misunderstood the book's argument.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.3.1.1. Pro: While it is true that Darwin's later ["Descent of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Descent_of_Man,_and_Selection_in_Relation_to_Sex#On_the_Races_of_Man)" did devote some consideration to the "Races of Man," and did accept the \(now widely debunked\) biological categories of the 19th century, even there his primary argument was to argue for [monogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogenism), the view that is now entirely accepted. Thus, even in this case, it would be a misunderstanding to claim that the theory of natural selection was developed to defend the superiority of caucasians.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.3.1.2. Con: Darwin [believed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672903/)in [different biological races](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2009/02/was_charles_darwin_a_racist.html) and that the Europeans were the [highest](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-w-whitehead/what-did-charles-darwin-r_b_166521.html) on the evolutionary chain, and he describes in the Descent of Man a future hope that 'savages' will be done away with so the evolutionary gap will widen to "the Caucasian and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as at present between the[negro or Australian](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/728232-the-descent-of-man) and the gorilla.”
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.3.2. Pro: Darwin's works contained many sexist arguments that women were [less creative, inventive, and courageous](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672903/) than men due to lesser evolved brain sizes.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.3.3. Pro: Darwin [distinguishes](https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/darwin-reader-darwins-racism/) between the "dark coloured races of men," sometimes termed the 'Melanian races' or 'savages' and the "white and civilised races” in the Descent of man.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.3.4. Pro: Darwin's belief and proposed evidences that the Caucasian race was the most highly evolved race were later [used/misused](http://www.naturalselectionanddarwinism.com/racism.html) by others to support eugenics and the superiority of the Aryan race.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.3.5. Con: The problem being alleged in this discussion with Murray's work isn't that he also holds racist beliefs. It's that his work relies on scientifically indefensible racist sources. Analogizing this critique with the fact that Darwin personally held racist and sexist believes is therefore almost certainly a red herring.
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.3.5.1. Pro: Even if the contrast between Murray's reliance on scientifically discredited racist sources were analogous to Darwin's argument, trying to use Darwin's esteem in the scientific community to defend the legitimacy of Murray would still amount to an instance of the[tu quoque fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque).
1.6.11.2.1.1.4.1.2.3.5.2. Con: Darwin's books \(especially the [Descent of Man](http://www.racismreview.com/blog/2009/02/12/charles-darwin-did-he-help-create-scientific-racism/)\) were specifically racist - not just his personal views outside of his scientific work. Conversely, Murray has been criticized not for pulling data specifically from a racist study or source nor for specific racist sayings himself, but because several studies he pulled from were from a journal that has had racist connections and motivations in the past.
1.6.11.2.1.2. Con: The letter in neuroscience misrepresents Charles Murray's work with a [straw man fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man), that Murray's work only dealt with 'nature' and not nurture; and it was that straw man argument that it attacks. The scientific consensus it mentions, that both nature & nurture [may affect IQ](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/06/04/specials/herrnstein-bell.html), is also [a view held by Murray i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve)n his work and further clarified by him [here](http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s2000060.htm).
1.6.11.2.1.3. Con: The opinion piece in Vox does not specifically contradict any of Murray's work and admits that many portions of his work they find factually true. Their disagreement is over some of Murray's interpretations of data, and they clarify that his view is not outside mainstream science with, "We believe there is a fairly wide consensus among behavioral scientists in favor of our views, but there is undeniably a range of opinions in the scientific community."
1.6.11.3. Con: The only way a consensus can be achieved is by considering all ideas. Banning one half of the argument does not achieve a consensus, it merely achieves authoritarian thought control.
1.6.11.3.1. Con: There is a clear difference between "wrong" and "illegitimate." It seems fairly safe to say that flat-earth societies and conspiracy theorists are illegitimate and do not deserve a platform on university campuses.
1.6.11.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.5.1.1.
1.6.11.4. Pro: Constitutions that guarantee the same treatment and rights to everyone set the consensual framework and baseline for discussion. In states constitutionally committed to equal rights, discriminatory ideologies do not represent equally plausible arguments.
1.6.11.4.1. Pro: It is highly hypocritical that someone who promotes that some subgroups \(based on race, gender, origin…\) should be stripped of their rights, must always be entitled to their free speech rights.
1.6.11.4.1.1. Pro: Someone like Ann Coulter believes she has the [constitutional](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/us/ann-coulter-berkeley-speech.html) right to speak at a university while asserting that [women](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/ann-coulter-women-should-not-have-the-right-to-vote-but-they-can-still-write-books/) should not be allowed to vote.
1.6.11.4.1.2. Con: Such hypocrisy is certainly reprehensible, but it does not necessarily follow that this disqualifies someone from exercising their own rights.
1.6.11.4.1.3. Con: No-platforming makes social justice movements appear hypocritical.
1.6.11.4.1.3.1. Pro: As universities are often left wing spaces, hate-mongerers and bigots on the right are often no-platformed while their equivalents on the left are welcomed with open arms. This makes no-platforming appear to be a political tactic as opposed to a principled stance.
1.6.11.4.1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.1.3.
1.6.11.5. Con: This only applies if no-platforming is directed against discriminating ideologies. If controversial figures are excluded from academic spaces for provocative arguments unrelated to discrimination, their exclusion rather undermines their democratic free speech right.
1.6.11.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.
1.6.11.6. Con: No-platforming is unnecessary to solve the disparate balance of arguments, because schools could require controversial speakers to share the stage with peers that defend an opposed stance.
1.6.11.6.1. Con: While schools *could* require this, they do not currently do so. Until measures are actually put into place that obviate the need for no-platforming, it remains an effective preventative tool.
1.6.11.6.2. Pro: As radicalisation has been a concern in the UK, the government wanted to implement a policy to no-platform extremist speakers in campuses. Instead, different parties agreed on an alternative measure that allows universities to give a platform to extremists, but only if it is shared with somebody with [opposing](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/17/universities-allowed-host-extremist-speakers-within-limits) views.
1.6.11.6.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.2.1.
1.6.11.6.4. Con: That is precisely what no-platforming wants to avoid. For example, giving a platform to a racist and a non-racist creates the false balance that both views are equally correct, proved and admissible and that is not true.
1.6.11.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.
1.6.11.6.5. Con: As a practical matter, it will be difficult to ensure that there is always a balancing opposing view for any controversial speaker.
1.6.11.6.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.12.1.
1.6.11.6.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.5.2.
1.6.11.7. Con: Scientific consensus has been proven wrong in the past many times \(see, for example, [this link](http://www.medicaldaily.com/mad-scientist-6-scientists-who-were-dismissed-crazy-only-be-proven-right-years-later-362010)\). This is why it is important to evaluate even controversial ideas that challenge the consensus. It does not give validity freely, but rather gives all ideas a fair chance to be validated.
1.6.11.8. Con: Most public debates hosted in university are not about scientific facts. Instead they are about issues of values, politics, and philosophy that cannot be validated or invalidated  using the scientific method or standards.
1.6.11.9. Con: The vast majority of speakers who provoke no-platforming responses speak on political matters, with opinions outside of the possibility of scientific validation.
1.6.11.10. Con: Unsubstantiated ideas are the ones which most require public discussion.
1.6.11.10.1. Con: Any argument for an unsubstantiated claim is a poor argument, and it's harmful to showcase poor arguments.
1.6.12. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.
1.6.13. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.1.4.
1.6.14. Pro: True freedom of speech requires multiple parties to have equal access to audiences and equal power to express themselves. No-platforming can be used by students to help redress inequalities in access as well as power imbalances.
1.6.14.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.
1.6.14.2. Con: Being invited to or paying to speak at an institution is a hosted event, not just a demonstration of your right to expression. Free expression has nothing to do with a right to an audience; you have no right to demand people listen to you. True free expression is the right to express your beliefs without legal repercussions. You can do that on the street corner as well as on a stage.
1.6.15. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.2.
1.6.16. Con: There are no power asymmetries given the influence students have in creating campus and community norms, opinions, and beliefs.
1.6.17. Con: Power asymmetries do not exist in a free marketplace of ideas. "No-platforming" is an example of power asymmetry where a more powerful syndicate can usurp another's liberty to speak freely.
1.6.17.1. Con: This likely misdescribes the most common dynamic in which no-platforming is deployed: when students groups seek to have officially invited speakers disinvited. It would be odd to regard students as holding more power than official university organizations.
1.6.17.1.1. Con: Invited speakers are often invited by individual members of the university faculty or by student groups. As a whole students certainly have similar, if not more, leverage over those individuals or organizations.
1.6.17.1.2. Con: Universities depend on students for funding, students who judge what university they choose based on public prestige derived from their perceived academic validity. "It would be odd" to believe that students are not able to influence official university organisations in any capacity, especially via popular protest or through Student's Unions.
1.6.18. Con: University speaker no platforming appears to come primarily from popular protest aimed at organising bodies, suggesting it will reinforce normative values \(thus reinforcing power asymmetries\) and make university speaking more of a popularity contest for parroting already accepted ideas than a way to freely give, receive and challenge ideas.
1.6.18.1. Pro: For [example](http://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/ucl-pro-palestinian-protest-friends-of-israel-students-hen-mazzig-video-freedom-of-speech-breached-a7557791.html), an ex-Israeli soldier speaker was shut down by popular protest for their views by a pro Palestinian group in a university setting.
1.6.19. Con: No-platforming is outside the bounds of free speech. While one can certainly decide to deny their own platform and be considered in the realm of "exercising free speech", the same does not apply to the denial of a platform that is not one's own.
1.6.19.1. Con: As students are the ones no-platforming, the platform they are deciding on is indeed their own platform.
1.6.20. Con: Free speech means you use words to express your ideas. No-platforming is physically acting in order to force compliance with your illegitimate demands. Your demands are illegitimate because you have no justification for appointing yourself arbiter of what other people get to hear. There is no equivalence here.
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.
1.8. Con: The 'no platform' policy operates to protect students from vilification, hatred and radicalization.
1.8.1. Con: This may be the goal of no-platforming, but the consequence will be more of what they are trying to prevent: vilification of students who support controversial speakers, hatred of conservatives and libertarians, and empowerment of radical left groups to define the conversation.
1.8.1.1. Pro: No-platforming leads to radicalization and vilification of many right-leaning or libertarian groups who are unjustly lumped into actually violent, racist, and disgusting organizations.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: There is no evidence that this alleged vilification and lumping together of different groups occurs within universities, therefore it is not the responsibility of university groups to address it. Further, right-leaning and libertarian speakers are not considered hateful.
1.8.1.1.2. Con: Even if the unjust no platforming of conservatives and libertarians leads to their radicalization, the solution would be greater discretion in no platforming. The solution would not be allowing unabashed proponents of discriminatory or fascist views to disseminate their ideas on campus.
1.8.1.2. Con: Enlightenment values are necessarily the core of university values, and are considered leftwing/liberal values. It should be expected that left wing views dominate the conversation at a place of learning.
1.8.1.3. Pro: Attempts to no-platform that rely on ad-hominem attacks of a speaker, [labeling](https://www.facebook.com/events/131743294116559/) him or her fascist, racist, sexist, etc. can easily lead to retaliatory bullying of or racism targeted towards the speaker or towards others of the same ethnicity, such as how accusations that speaker Ben Shapiro was racist correlated with an uptick in anti-semitic comments in journalism overall and Ben Shapiro became the [most bullied journalist of 2016](https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/press-center/CR_4862_Journalism-Task-Force_v2.pdf).
1.8.1.3.1. Con: Ad hominems are only fallacious when the traits picked out are irrelevant to the conclusion being drawn. If a speaker is no-platformed as part of a campaign to deny a platform to hate groups, accusations that the speaker holds racist or sexist views are entirely relevant to the discussion.
1.8.1.3.2. Con: That Ben Shapiro was attacked for being racist may be correlated with an uptick in anti-semitic comments, but so is anything else that happened in 2016... Far more likely to be relevant than attacks on Shapiro, was the [rise](https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/15/politics/hate-groups-spiked-in-2016/index.html) of general activity among hate-groups in 2016.
1.8.1.3.3. Con: Shapiro has in fact supported programs that can justifiably be construed as racist: such as his support for an ethnic-[transfer](https://townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/2003/08/27/transfer-is-not-a-dirty-word-n976781) program that is [arguably](https://static.currentaffairs.org/2017/12/the-cool-kids-philosopher) indistinguishable from ethnic cleansing.
1.8.1.3.3.1. Con: Nothing in Ben Shapiro's article promotes ethnic cleansing, and he specifically eschews bloody conflict or any form of harm or oppression as a solution. Rather, his proposal is that Israel as a sovereign nation should have the right to transfer those groups opposed to its existence to a location outside of its borders.
1.8.1.3.3.2. Con: That Nathan J. Robinson can distort and misrepresent Ben Shapiro, over-extrapolating from quote fragments to build a guilt-by-association case that Ben Shapiro must support bloody ethnic cleansing, mass murder, etc. \(All things Ben Shapiro states he is strongly against\) is an example of why no-platforming risks people being misrepresented as racist or Nazis when they are not.
1.8.1.3.3.3. Con: No platforming someone like Shapiro, and only listening to excerpts and dramatizations of his stance is exactly why no-platforming is so dangerous. Shapiro has stated many times he is not in favor of ethnic cleansing, mass murder, or anything of the sort.
1.8.2. Con: "No platforming" does not protect students, and results in a net harm, because the same messages will appear in other media, off-campus, in political campaigns, etc. Unlike the typical university talk, in other venues \(e.g., TV\), there is often limited means of addressing the speaker, his or her supporters, or people who may be persuadable. No-platforming effectively trades a good venue for getting your argument across in exchange for venues where this is more difficult.
1.8.2.1. Pro: What a University will not cover, a for-profit media outlet might. Rather than pursue the ear of academics, radicals and hate groups will plead there case to a more "common" crowd, such as that found on social-media.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: Allowing a speaker on a college campus will not decrease the likelihood of them speaking in other venues. Ideas are more likely to receive attention when they have already received attention, and college talks are likely to raise the profile of their speakers. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of them being covered in the media.
1.8.2.2. Con: Not lending a platform to someone does not mean not discussing their ideas. Just because we don't allow proponents of an idea to propagate it freely doesn't mean that we can't analyze and hold critical discussions of their ideas.
1.8.2.3. Con: If we are interested in persuading onlookers or supporters of a speaker in search of platform, there are more effective methods than allowing the person to spread their ideas so we can debunk them. We can go directly to those people we want to persuade, and deliver our own ideas without amplifying the voice of the person they follow.
1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.3.11.3.1.
1.8.4. Con: No-platform does not necessarily protect students: trolls see the wall of protection and are even more motivated to make people's lives miserable as a result.
1.8.4.1. Con: Protection of students from harassment is only one function of no-platforming. More broadly, no-platforming prevents the propagation of discriminatory and fascist ideas. Ceasing no-platforming due to harassment efforts amounts to capitulation.
1.8.5. Pro: No-platforming ensures that university spaces are free of violence and hatred against the student population that may be the victim of hate speech or actions, whether by race, sexual, economic, racial, religious or political condition.
1.8.6. Pro: Karl Popper describes so called paradox of tolerance in The Open Society and Its Enemies like so: "If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, \[...\] then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.  \[...\] We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant".
This explains why no-platforming might be intolerant, but is the kind of intolerance towards the intolerant needed to preserve tolerance and open society.
1.8.7. Con: Hatred is not necessarily bad if the thing receiving hate is genuinely bad, for example if one hates something causing suffering in some way not considered. No-platforming hateful speech removes any chance of such unconsidered harm being uncovered and dealt with. At least some criteria for no-platforming a speaker is needed other than hatefulness of speech.
1.8.7.1. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.3.
1.8.7.2. Con: This is a mischaracterization of the meaning and use of the phrase "hate speech". Hate speech refers specifically to speech which incites hatred or discrimination against people who are vulnerable to societal and personal violence.
1.8.8. Con: Radicalisation can be caused by very rational seeming arguments, in which the extremism is not initially apparent. One is better led in a direction \(bad or good\) by a string of seemingly reasonable statements than a single drastic claim containing intense hatred, as subtler claims generate less objection, stigma and hesitation to accept.
1.8.9. Con: No-platforming is often done for [reasons](http://www.businessinsider.com/list-of-disinvited-speakers-at-colleges-2016-7) that have nothing to do with hatred, vilification, or radicalization: perceived guilt by association, speaker salary, perceived lack of action on political matters, not speaking on a topic the students would prefer, etc.
1.8.9.1. Pro: An attempt was made in 2004 to keep former President Bush from speaking at a commencement address at [Yale](https://www.thefire.org/resources/disinvitation-database/#home/viewdisinvitationattemptdetails/55a47479865eefae21210783/) due to his conservative views.
1.8.10. Con: As soon as students leave a no-platform practicing college, this protection will end, and the student will be ill equipped to confront such vilification, hatred, and radicalization in the greater public sphere.
1.8.11. Con: Vilification and hatred are very much a part of the world today and being exposed to it only helps individuals mature as people. Controversial topics need to be discussed to further the conversation. No-platforming people makes students believe it's okay to say somebody can't talk because they don't agree with you, and that's a dangerous road to go down.
1.8.12. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6.
1.8.13. Pro: -> See 1.3.11.3.
1.8.14. Pro: Racist or fascist commentary directly impacts students by giving air time to opinions that are extreme and encourage violence against minorities.
1.8.14.1. Con: [Incitement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incitement) has a very specific legal definition. As with any case of competing individual rights, it is best left up to the judicial system to determine the merit of each case.
1.8.14.2. Con: This is like saying giving spoons to overweight people caused their obesity issues. It only causes more issues if the people listening allow themselves to be persuaded. The answer to that problem is teaching people to think for themselves.....by allowing different points of view. the whole principle of this platform.
1.8.14.2.1. Con: Impact is not necessarily the same thing as cause. While establishing a causal link between a specific instance of hate speech and any specific change in a student's view would be impossible, it is much easier to see a link between the tacit acceptance of hate speech, the normalization of the views that motivate hate speech, and the creation of a hostile environment.
1.8.14.2.1.1. Con: That's too arbitrary to be valid.
1.8.14.2.1.2. Con: Allowing people to speak is not tacit acceptance of their views.
1.8.15. Pro: Due to the [threat](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/the-tall-quiet-kid-who-became-a-monster) posed by [extremists](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/11444711/Jihadi-John-Should-hate-preachers-be-banned-from-British-university.html) seeking to use campuses to radicalize students, the UK government [issued](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/439598/prevent-duty-departmental-advice-v6.pdf) 'The Prevent Duty', a group of procedures and advice to prevent people from 'being drawn to terrorism'.
1.8.15.1. Con: The government action was supposed to be mandatory and [legally](http://The government action was supposed to be mandatory and legally force universities to ban extremists form speaking in campuses. Yet the proposal was drop as Liberal Democrats raised concerns about free-speech.) force universities to ban extremists from speaking in campuses. Yet the proposal was dropped as Liberal Democrats raised concerns about free speech.
1.8.15.2. Pro: From September 2015 to January 2016, 30 [events](http://www.studentrights.org.uk/article/2391/student_rights_releases_model_external_speaker_policy) were planned in campuses across the UK \(only 3 did not occur\) in which homosexuality was labelled as ‘disgusting’ and convicted terrorists were defended or there was explicit support for terrorist groups.
1.8.15.3. Con: -> See 1.6.11.6.2.
1.8.16. Pro: Hate speech may further marginalise under-represented groups.
1.8.16.1. Con: The personal liberty views espoused by many as "hate speech" may offer a [viewpoint necessary](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/free-speech-campus/532965/) but previously unfulfilled to bring marginalized groups out of subjugation.
1.8.16.2. Pro: No-platforming is used when the a speaker is arguing in a debate over someone's character or merit as a human being. Thus, it is acceptable to shut out such questions as a personal attack against a certain non-organized group \(ethnicity, race, religion, sexuality, etc...\).
1.8.16.3. Con: No reasonable system can ever view speech as equivalent to pain, violence, or marginalization.
1.8.17. Con: -> See 1.1.9.4.
1.8.18. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.
1.8.19. Con: On the contrary, it insulates students from being able to clearly observe the differences between  extreme points of view. It muddies discourse and reality into less-defined choices that suit the nature and survival of vilifaction, hatred, and radicalization.
1.8.19.1. Con: There is no guarantee that a speaker with an agenda of hate will present their point of view rationally as though it is debatable.
1.8.20. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.7.2.8.
1.8.21. Pro: Universities should educate students on how to productively protest, no-platform, and otherwise take social action against hate speech. There is no demonstrated need to abandon no-platforming writ large, but rather to apply it only in the right situations.
1.8.22. Pro: No-platforming protects students from harm against them from groups that promote hate against their gender, race, or ethnic backgrounds. Many of the groups that no-platforming targets have perpetrated violent discourse in public in the past against many groups.
1.8.22.1. Con: Disagreeing with a policy or idea that purportedly benefits a given group is[very different from hating them.](https://www.theblaze.com/contributions/disagreement-doesnt-automatically-equal-hate/)
1.8.23. Con: It is futile to blind students to vilification and hatred, which exist whether or not they are seen on campus. There is no evidence that no-platforming prevents radicalization.
1.8.23.1. Con: Allowing speakers with hateful views to speak on campuses is not the only way to make students aware of such views. Critical discussion and analysis of ideas can take place without their proponents being present to disseminate them.
1.9. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.
1.10. Pro: No-platforming should be abandoned because it is an assault on free speech.
1.10.1. Pro: Freedom of speech is protected in a number of international instruments and domestic legislation.
1.10.1.1. Pro: Freedom of speech is protected in various domestic legal sources, such as the [First Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt1afrag1_user.html#amdt1a_hd4) and Article 10 of the [Human Rights Act \(UK\)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/I/chapter/9).
1.10.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.6.1.4.
1.10.1.2. Pro: Freedom of expression is protected in various human rights instruments, such as the article 19 of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/): 'Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression...' and article 19 of the [International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx)
1.10.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6.2.
1.10.1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.2.1.
1.10.1.5. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.
1.10.2. Con: Free speech laws guarantee the speaker protection from governmental oppression- not critique or protest from the civilian citizenry. With that in mind, it is not only permissible, but obligatory, to consider civil dissent in determining to whom public platforms should be given.
1.10.3. Pro: When you prevent someone from speaking by shouting them down or shutting down their event, you not only infringe upon their right to free speech, but also on everyone else's right to hear whatever is being said.
1.10.3.1. Con: This assumes there are no other avenues of speech for the messages to be communicated. In our current society this type of argument doesn't hold given the number of varied platforms speakers have.
1.10.4. Pro: To be afforded your own freedom you must tolerate the freedom of the opposition. Offense is not harm. Insult is not injury. If only one thing could be taken away from the platforming of hate, it should be to prepare those who would oppose those who hate; when they are no longer afraid of the consequences of violence.
1.10.5. Pro: Just as it is possible for an individual to violate someone's right to life \(by murder\) or right to freedom of movement \(by kidnapping\), so also an individual can violate another's right to free speech, through various means—including no-platforming. Just as X can violate Y's right to life by killing, so X can violate Y's right to free speech by preventing Y from being able to exercise that right \(e.g., by shouting down, removing amplification, etc.\).
1.10.5.1. Con: That there are some ways to violate free speech is not in dispute. But it has not been established that no-platforming is in fact such a violation.
1.10.5.1.1. Con: Any action taken that prevents free speech \(i.e., the communicative act\) from occurring is a potential violation of the right to free speech. Given that someone has a right to speak in the first place, then shouting down, blocking the audience from a lecture hall, cutting the mic, etc.—i.e., the actions that make up "no-platforming"—are all ways to prevent someone from communicating with an audience, i.e., speaking freely.
1.10.5.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.
1.10.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.2.2.
1.10.5.2. Pro: Our negative rights are, in general, claims against all actors, both governmental and non-governmental. While certain rights are claims against only the government, that is because only the government can be authorized to undertake certain actions against us \(e.g., habeas corpus\). But the right to freedom of speech is not merely a claim against the government. There are ways for individuals to violate it, i.e., by removing the means to speak freely that we would otherwise have.
1.10.6. Con: Racist speakers are the ones diminishing options for free speech of others by ignoring their equal rights to politics. No-platforming can thereby also be a protection of freedom of speech for those who would otherwise be silenced.
1.10.7. Pro: No-platforming isn't being used to shut out violent, hateful speech. It's being used to silence "the other side" regardless of the content of the message.  It's very much a with us or against us proposition.  It's being used to create echo chambers at institutions that once taught Reason.
1.10.8. Pro: Speech should only be legislatively restricted if it incites "imminent" danger, because that's the only speech you can reasonably police. "Possibly dangerous speech in the future" is too broad as manifested in US Laws.
1.10.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.2.1.1.
1.10.9. Con: This is not a free speech issue, as any speaker can speak freely via the internet. Rather, it must be seen as an issue of lending legitimacy to certain speakers, and certain speakers \(like [Richard Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Spencer) or others\) do not deserve legitimacy.
1.10.10. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.2.1.2.1.
1.10.11. Pro: It is unacceptable to sacrifice people's right to free speech in an attempt to restrict those expressing oppressive beliefs.
1.10.11.1. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.
1.10.11.2. Pro: No-platforming has targeted many people that could not be just labelled as provocateurs. In a lot of instances, they were people with views against the ideas of a particular group of students.
1.10.11.2.1. Pro: Berkeley students tried to reject a speech from comedian and TV host [Bill Maher](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/21/uc-berkeley-stop-bill-maher_n_6516032.html) because of his controversial remarks about Islam.
1.10.11.2.1.1. Con: As the article in the parent itself points out, the no-platforming effort was unsuccessful. Bill Maher did speak on campus.
1.10.11.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.2.1.
1.10.11.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.3.3.

1.10.11.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.3.2.3.
1.10.11.2.8. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.
1.10.11.3. Con: If the speaker's arguments are considered hate speech, they are then unlawful and [penalized by the law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_laws_in_the_United_Kingdom).
1.10.11.3.1. Con: This is not true in all places. Hate speech is illegal in the UK but it is constitutionally [protected](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-virginia-protests-speech-factbox/factbox-when-can-free-speech-be-restricted-in-the-united-states-idUSKCN1AU2E0) in the US unless it is likely to lead to imminent violence.
1.10.11.3.1.1. Con: Hate speech is not necessarily protected by the free speech clause of the US constitution. Many legal scholars have argued that hate speech is prohibited by the [equal protection clause](http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/tension.htm#6) of the 14th Amendment.
1.10.11.3.2. Con: If such speech is already illegal then "no-platforming" by members of the public should be unnecessary.
1.10.11.3.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.1.1.1.
1.10.11.3.2.2. Con: As hate speech needs to first happen to be punishable, that means that in order to stop it from happening on the first place, other measures such as no-platforming are necessary.
1.10.11.3.3. Pro: It is better to allow a controversial group to air frustrations in a public forum, rather than deny them that and add to already misguided grievances.
1.10.12. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.2.2.2.
1.10.13. Pro: Universities, as institutes designed for the exchange of knowledge, have a special obligation to promote free speech.
1.10.13.1. Con: Universities are indeed designed for exchange of knowledge. Exchange of opinion is an entirely different thing and Universities have no obligation to treat all opinions equally, in fact it would be wrong of them to do so.
1.10.13.2. Pro: Placing restrictions on expression can cause a chilling effect on how willing people are to investigate their beliefs.
1.10.13.2.1. Pro: The chilling effect works by creating an environment where students 'do not wish or want to face an opposing [viewpoint'.](http://theconversation.com/explainer-how-campus-policies-limit-free-speech-58974)
1.10.13.2.2. Pro: Restrictions on speech mean that students [believe](https://www.thefire.org/the-chilling-effect-in-action-campus-speech-codes-and-political-disengagement/) they have a right not to be offended.
1.10.13.2.2.1. Con: Students who choose to no-platform believe they have the right to not be oppressed by hate speech, not the right to not be offended.
1.10.13.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.2.1.6.
1.10.13.2.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.1.1.
1.10.13.2.3. Pro: The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education \(FIRE\) [identifies](https://www.thefire.org/the-chilling-effect-in-action-campus-speech-codes-and-political-disengagement/) that low voter turnout amongst 18 to 24 year olds in the US shows political disengagement. A policy limiting access to ideas through a 'no-platforming' policy will only make the situation worse.
1.10.13.2.3.1. Con: The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education has been criticized for being disingenuous about [its motives](http://prospect.org/article/conservatives-behind-campus-%E2%80%98free-speech%E2%80%99-crusade). It is largely funded by [libertarian and conservative](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Foundation_for_Individual_Rights_in_Education) leaning individuals and institutions. Given these biases, its conclusions should be regarded as suspect.
1.10.13.2.3.1.1. Con: Regardless of the motivations behind the study, [many](http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/why-young-people-dont-vote-part-apathy-part-frustration) [other](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21625820-young-are-passionate-opinionated-and-barely-aware-elections-lets-set-world) [studies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinebeaton/2016/11/04/whymillennialsarentvoting/#3bf89d4a190b) and surveys have concluded that voting turnout among young generations is very low in in the US and other [countries](https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx?view=print).
1.10.13.2.3.2. Con: The assumption that no-platforming will increase political disengagement is based on speculation. The opposite might be true as well: no-platforming engages many young people into protest and provokes them and their peers to form an opinion.
1.10.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.9.1.1.1.2.
1.10.13.4. Con: -> See 1.6.1.4.
1.10.13.5. Con: -> See 1.3.13.2.
1.10.13.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.3.2.

1.10.15. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.15.3.4.
1.10.16. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.2.1.
1.10.17. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.
1.10.18. Pro: No-platforming is functionally equivalent to the forms of censorship that authoritarians everywhere have favored.
1.10.18.1. Pro: To deny others an opportunity to speak is a fundamental tactic of [Authoritarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism).  And without intellectual diversity, we become a Fascist state:  "Fascist states pursued policies of social [indoctrination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoctrination) through [propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda) in education and the media and regulation of the production of educational and media materials." -- Wikipedia  [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#Tenets)
1.10.18.2. Pro: No-platforming is effectively censorship which could easily turn into discrimination of, for example, certain ideologies \(or lack thereof\).
1.10.19. Pro: All ideas should have a voice, even with we disagree with the ideas.
1.10.19.1. Con: Advocation of genocide and advocation of terrorism are by definition ideas. They have no place in a civil society.
1.10.20. Pro: Freedom is nothing if it precludes the freedom to insult and be insulted. No one should be banned from speaking and no one should be forced to attend.
1.10.20.1. Con: There is a difference between banning someone from speaking and not providing them a forum. There are people who do not receive an invitation to dinner at my house because I don’t want to hear their rhetoric. I am not violating their right to free speech in doing this but I am denying them a platform. Universities are doing much the same thing.
1.10.20.2. Con: There is a difference between someone being insulting and advocating the denial of people's right to exist \(i.e. genocide\).
1.10.21. Pro: No-platform allows an individual organization to decide who is and isn't allowed to speak. This in itself disables the morals of free speech from those who have a controversial opinion
1.10.22. Con: There are certain beliefs in society that are decidedly "not socially acceptable," specifically support for genocide, support for slavery, and other similar crimes against humanity. Those specific beliefs have no place in our sociopolitical system. Nazism in particular is aligned with fascism, and therefore is not protected by democracy.
1.10.22.1. Con: Most instances of no-platforming do not involve advocates of genocide, slavery, or other crimes against humanity.
1.10.23. Pro: Deplatforming people with dissident opinions is just another form of censorship that prevents the free exchange of ideas that is essential to any civilized country.
1.11. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.7.2.
1.12. Pro: No-platforming exacerbates divisions among students because those who support the visiting speaker will feel as if their viewpoints are being shut out by the majority.
1.12.1. Pro: A more productive and democratic way to deal with the divisions is to confront them head-on by allowing diverse viewpoints, so long as these viewpoints are peacefully presented.
1.12.2. Con: Some viewpoints, such as white nationalism, may deserve to be shut out by the majority.
1.12.3. Con: By acknowledging certain viewpoints as questionable fringe views, students who hold these views may be dissuaded from openly bullying and discriminating against others. 

Racist or homophobic views, for example, can lead to bullying if their holders are emboldened and normalised.
1.12.4. Con: When these viewpoints target other members of the university community, those feelings are of relatively smaller importance.
1.12.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.10.4.2.1.2.1.
1.12.4.2. Con: All publicly expressed viewpoints can impact members of the university community either by inclusion, exclusion, benefit, or cost.  The Academy is full of 'targeted' viewpoints that impact other members of the university community. For example, discussing toxic masculinity or instersectionality target other members of the university community.
1.12.5. Con: Universities cannot possibly represent all the students' opinions equally and it is not their job to do so.
1.12.6. Con: Uninviting a speaker does not equal shutting out a viewpoint. Students can still voice and defend their opinions in other discourses themselves, even if the person affected by no-platforming doesn't appear in public.
1.12.7. Con: The message of the divisive speaker is what produces the division. Whatever occurs as a result of denying entry to a divisive speaker only helps manifest what already exists.
1.12.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.2.1.4.
1.12.9. Pro: No-platforming creates a slippery slope wherein those who hold the dominant political narrative are afforded the power to dictate what can and cannot be discussed.
1.12.9.1. Pro: It is problematic to determine who can legitimately allow speakers or not and, at the same time, who can decide what others are able or free to hear.
1.12.10. Pro: The often wildly-exaggerated rhetorical justifications for 'no platform' actions can promote marginalization, vilification and hatred  directed at students of perceived controversial or innovative thought.
1.12.11. Con: Conflict should not be seen as intrinsically negative. If managed appropriately, it may reveal unaddressed issues crucial in creating a more tolerant space.
1.12.11.1. Con: Indeed, conflict should not be seen as intrinsically negative. Neither should controversy. This is exactly why controversial and conflict-creating speakers should be allowed an equal opportunity to voice their viewpoint.
1.12.11.2. Pro: This could be used as an opportunity to engage the student body in a debate that heals that division, without giving a platform to representatives of abusive discourse.
1.13. Pro: No-platforming hinders productive discourse.
1.13.1. Pro: Social justice warriors are fighting for diversity and inclusion based on identity politics. In the process they are stifling diversity of opinions which leads to more polarization and more dehumanization of the other.
1.13.2. Pro: If no-platforming is a policy and not an exceptional act of civil protest, it continuously allows and normalizes to rule out unwanted opinions. As a policy it over-generates exclusion from discourse and loses its political expressiveness.
1.13.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.13.
1.13.3. Pro: No-platforming assumes offensive speech before it occurs, which leaves no room for rehabilitation and progress. It would be more adequate to publicly oppose speakers, also by university officials, if a discriminating statement is made.
1.13.3.1. Con: Many of those who advocate oppressive ideas do not rely on logical reasoning and are therefore difficult to adequately disprove to those that might be persuaded by their rhetoric. This makes reasoning with them beside the point. Indeed, it may give the veneer of rationality to what are fundamentally irrational ideas. In such cases, no-platforming is a more effective remedy than simply offering an opposing view.
1.13.3.1.1. Con: On the contrary, those whose views are not based on logical reasoning should therefore be easy to disprove. The point is not to dissuade the debater but the audience. One cannot lose a debate based on whether one debater cares and the other doesn't, but on the validity of the ideas debated.
1.13.3.1.2. Pro: For example, feminist columnist and author Laurie [Penny](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/21/milo-yiannopoulos-rise-and-fall-shallow-actor-bad-guy-hate-speech) stated that she would not debate Milo Yiannopoulos in public:  “because I know I’ll lose, because I care and he doesn’t – and that means he has already won”.
1.13.3.2. Con: A speaker's past statements and intentions are legitimate ways of inferring their goals. Thus, social justice movements have a legitimate interest in no-platforming speakers who have engaged in hate speech in the past.
1.13.4. Pro: Not at all students hold the same views and "No Platforming" can prevent legitimate opposing views and solutions to problems from being heard.
1.13.5. Pro: This practice should not be used by any civilized society that wants any hope of ending disagreements peacefully. this is in essence the similar to but far worse than effectively sticking your fingers in your ears and yelling as loud as you are able rather than hearing another viewpoint however wrong it may be and intelligently proving it to be wrong. it only leads to escalation and often violence.
1.13.6. Con: The loss of some productive discourse is a reasonable cost to avoid spreading hateful speech.
1.13.6.1. Pro: It is possible that the productive discourse would be generated regardless.
1.13.6.2. Con: -> See 1.4.10.2.3.
1.13.6.3. Con: It is impossible to weigh the impact of the productivity of discourse with the impact of avoiding broadcasting hateful speech.
1.13.7. Con: Speakers who are no-platformed at a particular university can find alternative platforms \([like Bindel's video](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/if-you-dont-like-no-platforming-maybe-its-you-whos-the-special-snowflake-a6884026.html)\), fostering productive discourse through other channels.
1.13.7.1. Con: This simply cedes the point of intended alienation against the affected speaker.
1.13.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.11.
1.13.9. Pro: The meaning of productive discourse is to present opposing views. If no-platforming removes those with oppressive views from participating, their views remain unchallenged, thus being more likely to convince those who may be persuaded by that kind of rhetoric.
1.13.9.1. Con: Changing oppressive views from individuals who were going to hear a controversial figure \(whose ideas they align with\) is unlikely to happen because those ideas are debated.
1.13.9.1.1. Con: Even if it is true that the views of some individuals will never change, the views of those with less defined opinions may. This is why it is important that these people can hear activists advocating why oppressive views are wrong.
1.13.9.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.12.1.
1.13.9.2. Con: Those with oppressive views already know how disgusting the world finds their beliefs. They argue in bad faith, relying on the short memory and base instinct of the masses, and have no wish to discourse productively in the first place.
1.13.9.3. Con: In fact, giving these individuals a platform might make them feel even more like their views are legitimate as it becomes acceptable to advocate these views publicly.
1.13.9.4. Pro: People tend to [remember](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_exposure_theory) and seek [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_theory) that reinforces their pre-existing beliefs. Thus students who are developing extremists views will likely consume information in that direction \(e.g. videos from no-platformed speakers\) and miss the opportunity to have those views challenged in an academic context.
1.13.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.
1.13.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.2.
1.13.9.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.11.6.2.
1.13.9.8. Con: Providing the resources \(and very often honoraria or speaking fees\) to people who promote e.g. racism is a tacit legitimization of their views.
1.13.9.8.1. Con: Universities currently allow a vast range of different views on different topics, but no one thinks this means they tacitly legitimise any of them.
1.13.9.8.1.1. Pro: A recent workshop hosted at Ohio University claimed that whites could not be victims of racism, but the college [specifically disavowed that view](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/20/ohio-state-university-privilege-workshop-says-only-white-people-can-be-racist.html) and did not endorse it.
1.13.9.8.1.1.1. Con: It is unclear if this is a good model for how Universities ought to function, only insofar as certain concepts are certainly so clearly outdated that the inherent process of curation of workshops or lectures constitutes the content of the educational exploration. In other words, the University chooses and prioritizes which ideas to expend energy on.
1.13.9.8.1.2. Con: In the academic setting, certain outdated perspectives in any department \(e.g. geocentrism in astrophysics\) are widely known to be illegitimate, and as a result those views are not given a platform. Thus, their appears to be at least a correlation between legitimization and providing a platform for an idea at a university.
1.13.9.8.1.2.1. Con: In order to determine the legitimacy of a perspective, it must be completely tested, and exposure to the public is therefore necessary. Giving bad ideas platform is a step prior to determining them to be illegitimate.
1.13.9.8.1.2.1.1. Con: It is unclear whether funded university talks are the proper platform for this process of evaluation to happen, nor is it clear that this is how these speaking engagements ultimately function or are even intended to function.
1.13.9.8.1.2.1.2. Con: Exposure to the public is certainly not necessary in order for an idea to be tested. The general public knows very little about most sophisticated issues facing today's societies.
1.13.9.8.1.3. Con: Actually, teaching these views DOES legitimize them. Many different competing views can all be legitimate at the same time, so long as they have evidence and are logically valid. The illegitimate views which have no basis in reality \(e.g. flat-earthism, creationism, Holocaust denial\) are not taught by these universities.
1.13.9.8.1.3.1. Con: If a view must "have evidence and \[be\] logically valid" to be legitimate, then simply providing an illegitimate view with a platform can't legitimize it.
1.13.9.8.1.3.1.1. Con: There is a difference between whether a claim is actually legitimate and whether it is being legitimized. In this context, the verb "to legitimize" means "to give undeserved attention to illegitimate claim," as if there was actually evidence behind it. The parent claim seems to be using the word "legitimize" in a way that is not clearly defined.
1.13.9.8.2. Pro: The idea that one ethnic group is inherently superior to another has no basis in scientific reality. Therefore, allowing white nationalists and other racists a platform at a university is akin to allowing flat-earthers a platform. These ideas have no place at a college, or other public venue.
1.13.9.8.2.1. Con: Flat-earthers should speak at universities if they are invited to.
1.13.9.8.3. Pro: Giving a credible platform to extreme views legitimises them.
1.13.9.8.4. Con: There's no such thing as an illegitimate view. Some views might be wrong or might be contrary to your own, but that does not make them illegitimate.
1.13.9.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.6.11.3.1.
1.13.9.8.5. Con: Speakers can be falsely accused of promoting racism, and so pulling resources to avoid 'legitimization' becomes an easy path to censorship.
1.13.9.8.5.1. Pro: Virtually none of the people who are no-platformed actually promote racism. More typically, social justice activists infer that the speakers are racists because the speakers advocate certain views that the activists want to delegitimize as racist. Since they aren't really racists, but only have unpopular views about Islam and immigration \(for example\), providing them with resources is not a tacit legitimization of racism.
1.13.9.8.5.1.1. Con: Charles Murray's work is fairly regarded as [racist](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/charles-murray) by organizations such as SCPL which track hate groups in the United States. This contradicts the view that virtually none of the people who are no-platformed actually promote racism.
1.13.9.8.5.1.2. Con: Richard Spenser is an [avowed white supremacist](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/richard-spencer-white-nationalist-leading-alt-right-movement/) who openly admires National socialism. This contradicts the view that virtually none of the people who are no-platformed actually promote racism.
1.13.9.8.5.1.3. Con: Leaked [records](https://www.avclub.com/read-this-how-milo-yiannopoulos-served-as-a-bridge-bet-1819197895) of Milo Yiannopolous's collaboration with Breitbart shows a coordinated effort to connect elements of the alt-right with more explicit white supremacist and white nationalist groups. This demonstrates that at least some people who are no-platformed promote racist ideologies.
1.13.9.8.5.1.4. Con: The National Union of Student's no-platforming campaign [began](https://hatfulofhistory.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/by-whatever-means-necessary-the-origins-of-the-no-platform-policy/) in order to combat efforts by the National Front, which was having success mainstreaming neo-Nazi and other racist groups on UK university campuses. At least early in its history, it was narrowly focused on that.
1.13.9.8.5.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.3.3.
1.13.9.8.5.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.3.2.2.
1.13.9.8.5.1.7. Con: When a speaker is known to hold unpopular views about Islam, it is possible that they have made a good-faith effort to understand and educate themselves in an unbiased way about the Islamic tradition, in which case their findings deserve to be heard and considered. However, if their public statements are accompanied by discriminatory rhetoric against Muslims, it is reasonable to conclude their arguments will be distorted by that bias, in which case the speaker can and should be disregarded.
1.13.9.8.5.2. Con: In a similar way, no-platformed speakers may falsely claim that their own views are not racist, even if racist bias plays a role in their arguments and public behavior. In this case, the speaker may simply be unaware of their own biases, or of the race issues that their rhetoric nonetheless helps to exacerbate.
1.13.9.8.5.2.1. Con: But by no-platforming them, a racist speaker will never get their views disgraced in a public forum. they will not have people to tell them WHY their views are wrong. if they're just no-platformed at the beginning, they'll just believe this particular group doesn't understand what they're trying to promote.
1.13.9.8.6. Con: Some universities allow professors to post arguably racist comments on their [websites](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/letter_to_csu_chancellor), or host [workshops](https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/43361/) and [courses](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/01/09/a-white-racism-class-just-started-at-a-florida-university-police-were-on-standby/?utm_term=.fb4f0ddf56d1) specifically designed around the negative labeling and grouping of people by the color of their skin. Those are all more reflective of what a university agrees with and endorses than the words of a guest speaker.
1.13.9.8.6.1. Con: That universities endorse courses in which  [“whiteness and racism”](https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/43361/) are discussed, “with the goal of addressing the alleged problems that white people have with discussing racism” clearly shows where universities stand: acknowledging racism and trying to confront it.
1.13.9.8.6.1.1. Con: Teaching and promoting a broad blanket statement that links the amount of melanin in a person's skin with someone's ability to discuss a cultural topic is an attempt to link skin color with a proposed negative character trait, and hence a racist judgement on color of skin and not character.
1.13.9.8.6.1.1.1. Con: In countries where race [discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States) is widespread and rooted in history, some races have more privileges and opportunities than others, and there is nothing wrong or racist in acknowledging that. Besides personality or character, social environment and life experiences make those more [privileged](https://scarab.bates.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.es/&httpsredir=1&article=1150&context=honorstheses) less [aware](https://ose.utsc.utoronto.ca/ose/story.php?id=2135) of the harsh realities of those less fortunate.
1.13.9.8.6.1.1.1.1. Con: White people do not have more privileges than other races. There are no laws that benefit them more than others. If anything, affirmative action is a law that give Asian and White people the least privilege of anyone.
1.13.9.8.6.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The fact that current laws in the US do not discriminate non-whites, is not able to compensate for their legacy, and therefore it does not mean that the US has been able to wipe out racial [discrimination](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/21/hiring-race-discrimination-african-americans-study) entirely.
1.13.9.8.6.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Non-whites](http://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/) are more likely to be arrested for drugs, stopped by the police and sentenced to prison for longer times. Research points that [white-sounding](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/discrimination-job-market-united-states) names are 50% more likely to receive a call-back from a job than black-sounding names and 61% of US citizens believe more changes are needed to achieve [racial equality](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/3-discrimination-and-racial-inequality/).
1.13.9.8.6.2. Con: Acknowledging that [white supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy#United_States) and [white racism](https://theconversation.com/why-i-teach-a-course-called-white-racism-90093) exist, is not labeling a group negatively based on their skin color, is taking into account how [systemic](https://www.thoughtco.com/systemic-racism-3026565) racist dynamics operate.
1.13.9.8.6.2.1. Con: Broad skin-color based labels promote racist stereotypes and do little to address the topics of social class imbalance, social stratification, or historical oppression.
1.13.9.8.6.2.1.1. Con: The fact that North America was [colonized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States#Colonial_period) by white Europeans which created a system that oppressed other races \([native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States#European_exploration_and_colonization) Americans or [Blacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States)\) is not a racist stereotype about white people, is just the history of the US. A painful past that needs to be taken into account to analyze the present.
1.13.9.8.6.2.1.2. Con: Social imbalances and stratification are impossible to analyze without taking into account historical and present day [oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States) and [discrimination](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/9/18/16307782/study-racism-jobs) based on race.
1.13.9.8.6.3. Pro: Any suggestion that individuals has certain traits because of their race is racist. Statistics can show a tendency for one group to go in a different direction than the other, yet that says nothing about any of the individuals. Nor about why.
1.13.9.8.6.4. Con: This is whataboutery - that some universities turn a blind eye to what their professors say says absolutely nothing about whether student unions should be allowed to bar external speakers.
1.13.9.8.7. Pro: The ritual and setting of a public speech at a university demands the honoring or at least polite introduction of a speaker. The setting intrinsically restricts open critique to a certain level.
1.13.9.8.7.1. Con: It is possible to simultaneously be entirely polite, and entirely critical.
1.13.9.8.8. Pro: The same resources could be used for more positive, diverse and productive events.
1.13.9.8.8.1. Pro: It is wasteful to use these resources for events that fewer students will attend, due to the speakers' well-known extreme points of view. It would be more economically viable to host speakers who have not already compromised their own credibility with the student audience.
1.13.9.8.8.2. Con: Given that there is never full consensus on which events are most productive, it is futile to suggest that some are objectively more productive than others.
1.13.9.8.8.2.1. Con: Relativist stances of this nature are suspect, since the argument itself cannot be justified as productive without a contradiction. If on the other hand, the parent argument merely intends to promote a skeptical position toward objective claims of productivity, then one can certainly make a case for or against the value of hearing out a particular speaker depending on the context.
1.13.9.8.9. Con: Simply providing funding to host a speaker only shows that they have been provided with a platform to speak. Universities often invite speakers who have controversial viewpoints to help foster debate within the university and to enable interesting public lectures. It would be naive to conclude that such support is tacit legitimisation.
1.13.9.8.9.1. Con: It would be naive to assume paying for the speech doesn't legitimize it. For people who make a living in public speaking, their ideas are their product. Paying for any product encourages the creation of more units of that product.
1.13.9.8.9.2. Pro: Universities, colleges, and departments all approve the salaries of professors with a wide variety of views that contradict each other and which are deeply repugnant to some professors, students, and the general public.
1.13.9.8.9.2.1. Con: Professors are part of the university, not guest speakers unrelated to the institution.
1.13.9.8.9.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.3.1.
1.13.9.8.9.2.2. Con: Professors need to follow the universities' rules and codes of conduct. Students and other personnel can fill complaints and they can be expelled, asked to [resign](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4546704/Professor-called-racist-asked-resign-students.html) or [investigated](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-sdsu-racism-20180105-story.html). None of those scenarios apply to guest speakers with no link to the university.
1.13.9.8.9.3. Pro: Many universities have some Trump voters on their faculty. If there is one broad viewpoint that is widely regarded as illegitimate by many faculty members, it is Trumpism. Nevertheless, the Trump-supporting faculty are paid and given a "platform." Hence, paying a person to speak and teach does not entail "tacit legitimization."
1.13.9.8.9.3.1. Con: -> See 1.13.9.8.9.2.2.
1.13.9.8.9.3.2. Con: Generally, Trump-supporting faculty are not paid and given a platform qua Trump supporters but for a specific expertise in research and teaching. It would be wrong for a public university to pay them to teach and speak for being Trump supporters.
1.13.9.8.9.3.3. Con: Just because supporting Trump might not be a disqualifying viewpoint, it does not follow that there are no disqualifying viewpoints for faculty members. Advocating white supremacy or promoting racial or gender motivated violence may still be disqualifying.
1.13.9.8.9.4. Pro: Universities, when legally obligated to allow a speaker on campus they believe racist, can easily make it clear that they do [not endorse](http://www.thebatt.com/news/university-releases-statement-on-controversial-speaker-richard-spencer-s-planned/article_c03f61ec-b118-11e6-a1e7-9f5f2416a890.html) the speech with some form of notice, announcement, or email.
1.13.9.8.9.5. Con: While an invitation might not imply support for the content of the views, it does imply that those views are a legitimate part of the conversation, which is precisely what social justice movements are contesting.
1.13.9.8.9.5.1. Con: This is operating under the assumption that there can be a non-legitimate viewpoint.  Every viewpoint, whether you like it or not, is legitimate.  Whether or not we choose to take that path is up to the group.  If it is a terrible idea, it will be rejected.  However, the idea should have a platform.  Silencing an idea through force almost never works.
1.13.9.8.9.5.2. Pro: For example, the LGBTQ society at Oxford protested against the invitation of broadcaster Jenni [Murray](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/be-trans-be-proud-but-dont-call-yourself-a-real-woman-frtld7q5c). For the students, giving a pulpit at a prestigious university and paying a £150 fee is “to endorse and reward her transphobic views” thus propagating, validating and normalising [transmisogyny](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4372924/Left-wing-Oxford-students-demand-ban-Jenni-Murray.html).
1.13.9.8.9.5.2.1. Con: Allowing only one side to judge the perceived "hatefulness" of another side's viewpoint is an unfair and dangerous standard. It allows such predominantly left leaning groups on college campuses to deplatform anything they disagree with. Leftist groups don't have the right to judge speakers as "racist" or "transphobic" just because they disagree with them.  Holding the belief that gender is not a social construct is not transphobic but a different view on the issue.
1.13.9.8.10. Con: -> See 1.4.12.3.4.2.6.2.1.16.
1.13.9.8.11. Pro: As these speakers become legitimized they may access additional speaking opportunities and further positions of power that amplify fascist discourses.
1.13.9.8.11.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.1.
1.13.9.8.12. Pro: Financial support for thought leaders who promote violence, hatred, and oppression literally supports their ability to further promote violence, hatred, and oppression.
1.13.9.8.12.1. Con: But then financial support will only encourage only one kind of narrative, since if you can't hear them you can't refute them. If any speaker is promoting violence, hatred and oppression, let them talk and show themselves as they truly are, trough debate and exchange of ideas, not just a simple label.
1.13.9.8.12.1.1. Con: There is no need for a second kind of narrative which promotes "violence, hatred, and oppression." Nor is there a need to hear ideas that have already been refuted countless times.
1.13.9.8.13. Con: It cannot be that platforming an idea is always equivalent to approving that idea.This is objectively falsifiable, as there are many organizations who give platform to viewpoints which fundamentally contradict.
1.13.9.8.13.1. Con: There is a difference between approving of an idea and legitimizing it. For example, a university might hold a panel on foreign policy from many experts, as the experts have well-constructed views regardless of whether the university disagrees with them. However, the university might no-platform a neo-Nazi, not \(only\) because the university disapproves of Nazis, but also because their viewpoint is a massive denial of history and completely illegitimate.
1.13.9.9. Pro: No-platforming only ends up protecting truly dangerous ideas from being refuted in reasoned public discourse.
1.13.10. Con: This implies that those being no-platformed are interested in productive discourse. But this is not always the case. Many of them are provocateurs who have no intention of engaging in real dialogue.
1.13.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.3.1.
1.13.10.2. Con: Just because some of those being no-platformed aren't seeking a dialogue it doesn't mean that there's no one else that is. It's best not to generalize and ignore the possibility of a great discussion and perhaps progress.
1.13.10.3. Con: -> See 1.10.11.2.
1.13.10.4. Pro: Conservative commentator Ann Coulter, whose event at Berkley was cancelled, has [stated](https://web.archive.org/web/20060430010955/http://www.news.cornell.edu:80/stories/April06/coulter.pre.dea.html) that she just wants to “stir up the pot” and that she does not pretend to be “[impartial](http://www.foxla.com/good-day/good-day-la-experts-and-other-guests/2065226-story) or balanced”. Such polemicists have no real interest in the productive exchange of ideas.
1.13.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.4.1.1.
1.13.10.5. Con: Even in the case of provocateurs, it can be an effective strategy to call their bluff, by offering them a chance to have a rational conversation. In this case, the failure to do so is their responsibility alone.
1.13.10.5.1. Con: -> See 1.13.3.1.
1.13.11. Con: Attention is scarce resource. There is not enough time to expose students to constructive views and ideas to give time to destructive ones.
1.13.11.1. Con: Attention is not a scarce resource, the ability to learn, to listen and to think is not finite Intellectual debate is like a muscle the more you use it the better it gets. The more you concentrate the better you get at focusing not the other way around. If we practice disproving hateful speakers we will also practice understanding useful ones.
1.13.11.1.1. Con: Recent [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5403814/) has highlighted that attention a limited resource crucial for cognitive function.
1.13.11.2. Con: Giving attention to a controversial speaker is not mandatory. If students dislike the speaker's position, no one forces them to pay attention or go to the event. People have the choice whether or not to give attention to "hateful" ideas. If such ideas are as bad and bigoted as they are claimed to be, then they should expect that no attention is given to them and nobody would show up to such an event. Furthermore, paying no attention to such views is the most effective way to delegitimize them
1.13.11.2.1. Con: As students have the choice to attend an event or not, they also should have the freedom to decide if they want to invite or organize and event in their campuses or not.
1.13.12. Pro: When people start to relinquish someone's right to speak —  before actually knowing what they are going to say — they create an environment based on political, emotional or personal judgements rather than free and fair communication. To discover new and interesting truths there should be no dressing down of a person's identity before actually listening to them.
1.13.12.1. Con: No-platforming does not necessarily involve action without foreknowledge of a speaker's intent. In many cases, no-platforming is the result of reasonably anticipating what a speaker is likely to say based on past speeches, writings, and so forth.
1.13.12.1.1. Con: Cases where intent and speech content can be reasonably known by specific and explicit comments or works by a potential speaker do not counterbalance instances where a partisan group or group of students [accuse](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/paul-gottfried-hamilton-college-talk-smeared-racist-martin-center/) a speaker of being [racist](https://www.chronicle.com/article/My-Title-IX-Inquisition/230489), [sexist](http://www.theclackamasprint.net/news/james-damore-sparks-protests-at-portland-state-university-during-visit/), etc. based off their personal interpretation of past works or comments of a speaker when that interpretation is not the only possible one, and the speaker decries that interpretation.
1.13.12.2. Pro: In the competition of ideas/beliefs/conclusions:
Trial by rational discourse tends to develop and reveal the best ideas.
Trial by combat has no correlation between the winning idea and its quality \(combat is random\).
Trial by shouting down opposition is marginally less barbaric than trial by combat \(no personal injury\).
1.13.13. Pro: In each case of no-platforming, there is room for both protest and productive discourse. If critical masses of activists approach situations with either goal, both will add to productive discourse rather than detracting from the opportunity.
1.13.14. Con: There is no opportunity for productive discourse with a fascist whose main goal is to mislead, distract, manipulate, and take advantage of any semblance of reason. Fascists benefit from leading others to believe they are reasonable and then spreading hateful, false ideas.
1.13.14.1. Con: "The fascist of the future will call themselves antifascists"-Winston Churchill. If you rob someone of their freedom of speech you are becoming the very thing you oppose.
1.13.14.2. Con: Many people who could be considered "fascist" are not trying to trick or mislead, but genuinely believe in the integrity of their own arguments.
1.14. Con: -> See 1.13.9.8.
