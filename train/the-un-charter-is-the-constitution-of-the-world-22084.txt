Discussion Title: The UN Charter is the Constitution of the world.

1. The UN Charter is the Constitution of the world.
1.1. Pro: It has a rhetoric that is constitution-like.
1.2. Con: It has not been approved or voted by the world population.
1.3. Pro: It, like other constitutions, was written in a special moment of the world's history.
1.3.1. Con: The Communist Manifesto was also written at an important point in history, but is not recognized as a constitution. Being written during an important time in history has nothing to do with a written document being a constitution.
1.4. Con: The UN does not have a valid competent court to review the constitutionality of actions by the Security Council
1.5. Pro: It contains a supremacy clause in Article 103: "In the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the present Charter and their obligations under any other international agreement, their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail"
1.6. Con: There is no world leader or world head of state ahead of the Security Council \(the executive branch\).
1.7. Pro: It is recognised as valid and has been ratified by most of the world's states.
1.8. Con: The Charter is too remote to world citizens, it does not have the same binding effect as their Constitution.
