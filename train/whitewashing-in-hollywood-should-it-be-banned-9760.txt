Discussion Title: Whitewashing In Hollywood: Should It Be Banned?

1. Whitewashing Should Be Banned in Hollywood Productions
1.1. Pro: Hollywood has a huge influence on cultural norms and as such, should be held responsible when it goes astray.
1.1.1. Con: The purpose of Hollywood is to provide entertainment. The responsibility is on society to understand what is being presented is for enjoyment.
1.1.1.1. Con: When corporations such as Hollywood hold such a large stake in how people are educated, then they inherently pick up a responsibility to educated them on the realities of the world.
1.1.1.2. Con: This negates the influence this entertainment has on people in society, especially children. It has been proven that film and television can affect people's thinking and development, society cannot ignore that because the original purpose of Hollywood was to provide entertainment.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: One [study](http://www.shrinktank.com/psychological-impact-whitewashing-asian-characters/) that looked at television consumption found that only white boys increased in self-esteem from television viewing while white girls, black girls, and black boys had a decrease in self-esteem.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Researchers in this study found white males are most represented and often are the main characters in shows that makes white males believe that they can succeed in the same way as the people on screen.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Females and POC were found to feel worse about themselves because they are often the side characters and/or engaged in stereotypical characteristics and so believe they can't move past that to be the heroes of the story, as they rarely see it represented.
1.1.1.2.2. Pro: One research [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pits.20621/abstract) found that when adolescents read stories about characters from a culture like their own cooperating with characters from an unfamiliar culture, they later display fewer stereotypes and more positive attitudes about the people belonging to the dissimilar group. There is no reason to believe this would be different in regards to film.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: [Researchers](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/5984522/Hollywoods-distortion-of-the-truth-alters-history-in-the-eyes-of-schoolchildren.html) have found that pupils are more likely to believe historical depiction's on film than the real version of events depicted through text books or teachers.
1.1.2. Con: Hollywood is held responsible by adults choosing to spend their money elsewhere when they are offended by the given material.
1.1.3. Con: Responsibility of cultural institutions like Hollywood should be a matter of public discourse not of laws and bureaucracy.
1.1.4. Pro: Whitewashing exaggerates negative racial stereotypes.
1.1.4.1. Con: Many actors will seek to learn as much as they can about the character that they are cast as. This is because actors want to be as informed as possible so that they can avoid contributing towards the propagation of problematic racial stereotypes.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: The scripts of some movies sometimes portray minority communities disrespectfully. Even if the white actor makes a good faith effort to be sensitive, the end product might still be offensive.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: This is an issue with the movie script itself and not something an actor irrespective of his or her race could control.
1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: An actor can request ['Inclusion Rider'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_rider) provisions to their contract, to ensure the cast and crew are more equally diverse.
1.1.4.2. Con: Racial stereotypes can, and have been propagated either way. Racism in Hollywood is present with, or without white actors playing the characters.
1.1.4.3. Pro: White washing can enforce the "[white saviour](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/hollywoods-white-savior-obsession-colonialism)" trope which is seen in many Hollywood films.
1.1.4.3.1. Pro: The two '[white savior'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film#Types_of_story) narratives often found in cinema are the 'inspirational teacher' and the 'man of principle'.
1.1.4.3.2. Pro: [The Last Samurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Samurai) is an example of a film in which a white man comes and rallies japanese samurai and ends up being a better Samurai than most of them, despite the fact that he had no experience in sword fighting and the japanese samurai had lived by the bushido code their entire life.
1.1.4.3.2.1. Con: The Last Samurai is an original screenplay. It is not even strictly historically inaccurate to depict westerners in [19th century Japan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Westerners_who_visited_Japan_before_1868) Therefore, it would likely not be subject to a whitewashing ban.
1.1.4.3.2.2. Con: It is easily arguable by studios that having a white character in these settings is a creative, not commercial decision. A [fish out of water](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater) can create tension, humour and increase the stakes for the audience.
1.1.4.3.2.2.1. Pro: It is a common trope in films to have at least one character who comes from outside of the culture of the film or in some instances the main grouping of characters so that the audience is given context for the customs, beliefs and context inherent in the film in a natural manner.
1.1.4.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: In Harry Potter, Harry's introduction to the world of wizardry gives the audience information about the magical world they need to understand the film such as how magic works and the structure of the magical world.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Whitewashing propagates the harmful stereotype that people of color are less talented than white individuals.
1.1.4.5. Con: In the current climate, films which exaggerate negative racial stereotypes will be called out on social media, and may even be boycotted. Thus, film directors, seek to avoid exaggerated negative racial stereotypes within their work.
1.1.4.5.1. Con: Negative racial stereotypes continue to be perpetuated in cinema and television, despite being called out unfavorably.
1.1.4.5.1.1. Pro: [Muslim](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/05/22/muslim-americans-plead-hollywood-change-its-casting-techniques-and-stop-casting-them-terrorists/102011516/) actors, for example, are often cast as terrorists in cinema.
1.1.4.6. Con: Whitewashing was a major problem in Hollywood up till the early 60s. 75% of the examples on this list occurred 50-80 years ago. And they are all the most egregious examples. There have been some less egregious examples recently, but the problem is well on its way to solving itself without the need for bans. [indiewire.com](http://www.indiewire.com/2016/02/the-20-worst-examples-of-hollywood-whitewashing-268110/)
1.1.4.6.1. Pro: As we can see from this list of worst recent examples, films with whitewashing in major rolls usually flop. Meanwhile, Black Panther will probably be the highest grossing film of 2018 just as Get Out was by far the most successful film of 2017's Best Picture Oscar Nominees. The problem is solving itself.  [io9.gizmodo.com](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-ten-worst-examples-of-whitewashing-from-the-last-fi-1749960081)
1.1.4.7. Pro: White actors portraying ethnic minorities are less likely to be sensitive to the portrayal of negative or offensive stereotypes.
1.1.4.7.1. Pro: Many acting techniques, such as the [Stanislavski Method](https://www.briantimoneyacting.co.uk/stanislavski-emotional-memory/), rely on the use of memories and past experiences to give dept and truth to a characters portrayal. White actors may not have the past experience to portray these minorities as effectively.
1.1.4.7.1.1. Pro: [Practical Aesthetics](https://www.revolvy.com/main/index.php?s=Practical%20Aesthetics&item_type=topic) acting technique requires the actor to relate their characters experience to their own life and react as they would naturally. In this instance race can change reactions and take away a white persons ability to portray a character to the highest standard.
1.1.4.7.1.2. Con: This is only the case for parts where the character's ethnicity is central to their character. For instance, an actor with military experience who is white may be better cast in the part of a soldier who was black in real life than a black actor who does not have military experience.
1.1.4.7.1.2.1. Pro: Where the portrayal of a character by an actor of the same ethnicity would be preferable for the quality of the film, casting directors have an incentive to cast an actor of that ethnicity. A ban is not necessary.
1.1.4.7.2. Pro: The [Japanese character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._Y._Yunioshi) in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's has been the subject of much criticism on account of it's stereotypical and harshly negative portrayal of Japanese people.
1.1.4.7.3. Pro: [Johnny Depp](http://entertainment.time.com/2013/07/03/johnny-depp-as-tonto-is-the-lone-ranger-racist/)'s portrayal of Tonto was criticised for his use of broken English and culturally inaccurate dress.
1.1.4.7.4. Con: Actors of colour are just as capable of portraying their ethnicity offensively.
1.1.4.7.4.1. Con: Many of the roles made available to minority actors are negative stereotypical ones. They are left with little choice if they want to succeed in Hollywood.
1.1.4.7.4.1.1. Pro: Many Indian characters are portrayed by people of South Asian diaspora but are made to put on stronger accents to fit into the Indian stereotype.
1.1.4.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: Dev Patel in Slumdog Millionaire, Irrfan Khan in Jurassic World, Vijay Amritraj in Octopussy and Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan in Life of Pi all speak with thicker Indian accents in their characters than they do in real life - in interviews, promotions or in Bollywood movies.
1.1.4.7.4.1.1.2. Pro: Aziz Ansari had an entire episode of his show 'Master of None' based on his frequent experiences as an Indian actor asked to 'do the accent', or portray a [stereotypical Indian man](http://www.businessinsider.com/aziz-ansari-addresses-hollywoods-race-problem-in-master-of-none-2015-11) in order to get a paying role.
1.1.4.7.4.1.1.3. Pro: Vir Das, in his Netflix comedy special, [Abroad Understanding](http://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/vir-das-in-netflixs-abroad-understanding-heres-an-indian-making-fun-of-americans-in-us-3394370.html) talks at the beginning of his act about how his set was not going to cover his accent or Apu from The Simpsons jokes, indicating that is what most foreign audiences expect from him.
1.1.4.7.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.5.1.1.
1.1.4.7.4.2. Pro: [66%](https://www.vox.com/2016/9/13/12889478/black-actors-typecasting) of roles credited as "Thug" are played by black actors.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1. Con: The role of the 'thug', as well as tales of 'rags to riches' and 'segregation' make up the majority of roles [Black actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_representation_in_Hollywood) are typecast in, and reflect the attitudes towards minorities by white production companies and audiences.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.1. Pro: Out of 3,000 Academy Awards winners, only [35 recipients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_representation_in_Hollywood#Black_Academy_Awards_Winners) have been Black, with majority playing roles casting Black people in a light of poverty, violence, or social inferiority.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2. Con: A ban on whitewashing does not necessarily imply that the stereotyping of minority cultures in popular media will stop.
1.1.4.7.4.3. Pro: Actors of colour face difficulty getting roles in Hollywood. Once they have those roles, it is unlikely they will be in a position to question the wishes of directors, producers and writers in how they portray their character for fear of losing their role.
1.1.5. Con: It's one thing to hold an industry responsible for its influence, quite another to use the threat of bans to force them into certain artistic and business decisions.
1.1.5.1. Con: When corporations are held responsible for their negative influence, yet do not take action towards changing it, bans can be a necessary step, like with cigarette companies.
1.1.5.1.1. Con: The entertainment industry has taken big steps toward improving in this area so this objection doesn't apply.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: Black Panther will likely be the highest grossing film of 2018. Get Out was by far the highest grossing and most profitable Best Picture nominee. These are just two examples but throughout the entertainment industry, minority filmmakers and minority performers have greater visibility and success. There are far fewer egregious examples of whitewashing, and films that do exhibit it tend to suffer at the box office.
1.1.5.1.2. Con: Cigarettes are products whose impact is universal and tangible, which makes it easy to pose a ban on a company manufacturing it. The impacts of whitewashing are much more difficult to quantify.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Pro: Cigarettes kill. Whitewashing does not.
1.1.5.1.2.2. Con: Bans are not always logical or based in quantifiable data. For example, women being able to walk topless is [banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_the_Nipple_\(campaign\)) in many countries, although there is no data showing negative impacts. Whitewashing can be similar in this regard.
1.1.6. Con: If we hold them responsible when it goes astray, we should praise them when they do well. Hollywood has a way to go in terms of diversity and inclusivity, but the advances they've made in recent years shows progress can be made without imposing bans.
1.1.7. Pro: Whitewashing denies children who are people of color the opportunity to have role models that they can relate to and aspire to be.
1.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.2.
1.1.7.2. Con: Hollywood directors and producers/actors are not social workers trying to change society and as such, should not be held culpable for children not having adequate role models.
1.1.7.3. Con: It is possible for children to have role models outside of their own race.
1.1.7.3.1. Con: Children are able to better relate with the lived experiences of individuals from their own race and should always have the choice to identify with a role model from a similar background as theirs.
1.1.8. Pro: Banning whitewashing would stop the perpetuation of myths about the skin colour of historical figures.
1.1.8.1. Pro: Jesus is commonly depicted as white, [despite it being much more likely that he had dark skin](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/insisting-jesus-was-white-is-bad-history-and-bad-theology/282310/).
1.1.8.1.1. Con: Hollywood doesn't have much to do with how Jesus Christ is depicted in popular culture.
1.1.8.2. Pro: Allowing the depiction of historical figures as an incorrect skin colour erases the role of their actual ethnic group in important historical events.
1.1.8.2.1. Con: One of the most famous examples of racebending is [Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_\(musical\)), in which the founding fathers of America are portrayed as actors of colour demonstrating the fact that America is created on the backs of immigrants and portraying a modern America onstage.
1.1.8.2.1.1. Pro: The use of race bending in this show added a depth and modern relevance to the story.
1.2. Con: The practice of casting needs to be kept in the hands of directors and producers.
1.2.1. Con: Casting decisions have a profound effect on how individuals in society see themselves and interact with others. This is why it is legitimate for the state to place rules on how the casting process works.
1.2.2. Pro: Banning white actors from playing non-white characters limits the creative freedom of film producers and actors.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Creatively satirising Hollywood's casting process by whitewashing is a mechanism by which awareness around whitewashing and broader racial issues can be raised.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: [Robert Downey Jr.](https://www.thoughtco.com/robert-downey-jr-tropic-thunder-2432187) played a whitewashed Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder. This satire raised awareness of the absurdity of whitewashing in Hollywood.
1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Paul Verhoeven cast a white actor as the character Rico in [Starship Troopers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120201/), who was Hispanic in the original novel, in order to satirise Hollywood's casting practices.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Casting is a creative and artistic decision. Laws should not regulate how a work of art is created. There can be genuine artistic reasons for casting across race. A film about slavery where all white roles are black and all black roles white could be a hypothetical example.
1.2.2.2.1. Pro: Such a ban would be an infringement on the liberty of expression, as it would censor filmmakers in what content they are legally allowed to publish.
1.2.2.2.2. Pro: The book Naughts and Crosses, currently being [adapted](https://www.google.ie/amp/www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-08-24/bbc1-to-dramatise-malorie-blackmans-young-adult-novel-noughts-and-crosses/amp/) into a TV show, depicts a race-bent reality were Black people are in power and White people are the oppressed. A ban such as this would prevent artistic representations of racism, such as this, from being brought to the screen.
1.2.2.3. Con: Banning white actors in this way could enliven the creativity, allowing producers and actors a chance to explore diversity in a new way.
1.2.2.4. Pro: Focusing on race is the real racism, any person should be allowed to play whatever role they are choose to, and pandering to the politically correct audience is creative suicide.
1.2.2.5. Pro: Being able to play a variety of characters, including those of another race, allows actors the freedom to expand and improve the range of their acting skills.
1.2.2.6. Pro: Sometimes altering the race of a character can be used to look at a well known story in a new way. Through typecasting actors so strictly you can stifle artistic creation.
1.2.2.6.1. Pro: Taking a film and recreating it helps a wide variety of people to become familiar with a timeless story, but in a way that may appeal to them.
1.2.2.6.1.1. Pro: [The Wiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiz_\(film\)), the 1978 musical film featuring Michael Jackson and Diana Ross, was a re-imagining of The Wizard of Oz. Without the creative freedom to do so, this film would not be the cult classic it is today within the Black community.
1.2.2.6.1.2. Con: Doing so at the expense of the writer's original vision can be detrimental to a particular community.
1.2.2.6.1.2.1. Con: The original film would still exist. Telling a story in a new way in no way takes anything from the previous version.
1.2.2.6.2. Pro: Some well known villians, who would traditionally be persons of colour can be portrayed by white characters in order to separate their villanious behavior from their race and comment upon the convention to cast POC as villians.
1.2.2.6.2.1. Pro: When [Tilda Swinton](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/31/ghost-in-the-shells-whitewashing-does-hollywood-have-an-asian-problem) was cast as "The Ancient One" in Marvel's Doctor Strange, producers argued that it avoided the portrayal of an orientalist stereotype.
1.2.3. Pro: Producers have to gauge critical as well as commercial success before casting actors in particular roles.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Films starring white lead actors are more universally accepted.
1.2.3.1.1. Con: Black Panther, a movie starring a predominantly black cast, broke global records, making over [$700 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/movies/black-panther-700-million-globally-box-office.html) within its first 2 weeks.
1.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Black Panther may be an exception to the norm, and not the norm itself.
1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con: It is also possible that the success of this movie is proof, as well as an opportunity for Hollywood and global audiences to see that minority-lead movies can be just as successful, if not more than movies with white leads.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: More people of color should be given the chance to be cast in films. Otherwise, they will never have the opportunity to become as universally accepted as white actors.
1.2.3.1.3. Pro: Regardless of ongoing racial prejudice, white stars are chosen due to a level of previous success and experience which fewer actors of colour have as 86.1% of leading actors in top theatrical films are white. [\(Hollywood Diversity Report 2018, p. 14\)](https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/UCLA-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2018-2-27-18.pdf)
1.2.3.1.3.1. Con: Star power and previous experience is an increasingly [unreliable](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21693591-hollywood-studios-can-no-longer-bank-pulling-power-famous-actors-fading-stars) predictor of films success.
1.2.3.1.3.2. Con: Actors of colour will never get the opportunities they deserve if they are denied roles they would otherwise have received because a white actor was cast instead. This stops them from developing the track record they need to make them a less risky choice for casting companies.
1.2.3.2. Con: Whitewashing movies is [bad business](https://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2017/04/19/whitewashing-hollywood-movies-isnt-just-offensive-its-also-bad-business). Since 2000, movies featuring whitewashed characters have lost money.
1.2.3.2.1. Pro: Since 2006, of the [18 studio movie releases](https://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2017/04/19/whitewashing-hollywood-movies-isnt-just-offensive-its-also-bad-business) featuring 'racially' dysmorphic' casting only 6 were profitable, collectively losing over half a billion dollars.
1.2.3.2.2. Pro: If this is indeed true, then it should also impact the bottom line of the production. Hollywood, being a profit seeking industry would then be incentivised to regulate against whitewashing. A ban would be unnecessary.
1.2.3.2.2.1. Con: Whitewashing does negatively impact bottom line, yet the practice continues.
1.2.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Movies such as [Ghost in the Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_\(2017_film\)), [Love Guru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Guru), [Aloha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha_\(film\)), and many others featuring whitewashing [lost money](https://www.theatlas.com/charts/SJgYjTqax).
1.2.3.2.3. Con: Yet these movies [continue to be made](https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/3/15142608/hollywood-anime-live-action-adaptations-ghost-in-the-shell). This demonstrates that the problem will not be solved naturally.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Before casting, potential actors are researched for their ability to attract a large enough audience. Studios then can gauge if using the actor is worth this financial risk.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: The success of a film is not solely reliant on the familiarity with the actors, as lesser known actors can also attract large audiences.
1.2.4. Con: Casting an actor is employing them and as such, the government has a right to place regulations on it. There are a wide range of [Employment Laws](https://www.thebalance.com/list-of-employment-laws-2062282) in affect in America.
1.2.4.1. Con: This is not a power delegated to the federal government by the constitution, and thus they have no legal right to do so unless the constitution is amended to give them that power.
1.2.4.1.1. Con: Laws constantly evolve and change with societal trends on what is considered an acceptable practice. If whitewashing is widely regarded as worth banning, the government will be justified in implementing such a ban, and legal documents can be amended to reflect the same.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: A government ban on whitewashing would never square with first amendment protections for the movie industry.
1.2.5. Pro: [Racebending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racebending) is a common trope in theatre designed to comment upon the story in a different way. This ban would eradicate this theatrical tool.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Due to the fact that theatrical productions are produced numerous times by different companies, there is a need to differentiate each version of a play from those that came before it. Showing the story through the eyes of a character of a different race can be one way of doing that.
1.2.5.2. Pro: In order to make older plays relatable to a modern audience, they can sometimes be set in a different setting or period in history. Sometimes, this will necessitate the changing of some immutable characteristics of the characters, such as race.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: This is true for the cinema remake of [Annie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_\(2014_film\)), in which a Black girl replaces Annie, a character originally portrayed about an orphan white girl.
1.2.5.3. Pro: [Cloud Nine](http://www.annarbor.com/entertainment/u-m-presents-caryl-churchills-gender--and-race-bending-cloud-9/) is one of the most famous examples of racebending and gender bending. In it, these techniques are used to highlight the absurbity of gender and race stereotypes.
1.2.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.8.2.1.
1.2.6. Con: Directors, producers and studio execs often make decisions based on precedent and habits. They will constantly recycle through the same old pool without diversifying. For example:[uk.businessinsider.com](http://uk.businessinsider.com/hbo-recurring-actors-and-actresses-on-shows-2015-6?r=US&IR=T)
1.2.7. Pro: Everyone involved in a film invests time and/or money to create it. They have a right to choose who they cast.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Filmmakers are the ones who take on the risk of making a film, not the state. The government is therefore not justified in dictating how they make their movie.
1.2.7.2. Con: The state facilitates filmmaking through [direct subsidy](http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/08/hollywood-funding/), allowing filmmakers to use public spaces and other mechanisms. It is therefore justified in intervening to create more representation.
1.2.8. Con: Directors and producers do not have complete control over casting in the status quo. They are influenced by outside interests such as studio executives.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Since studio executives bank roll Hollywood projects, they ought to have a say in what cast members are likely to get them the maximal return on their investment.
1.2.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.3. Con: A ban is not necessary when there are other ways to reduce the misrepresentation of other races.
1.3.1. Pro: The increasing importance of the [Chinese market](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/08/11/339485807/autobot-rule-why-transformers-4-is-chinas-box-office-champ) for Hollywood creates an incentive for the casting of more Asian actors.
1.3.2. Con: A ban forces Hollywood film studios to hire more actors who are people of color as soon as possible. Alternative policies such as cultural sensitivity training are not guaranteed to produce results.
1.3.3. Con: A ban shows the seriousness of the situation in the eyes of the Hollywood community and therefore will encourage further action to be made.
1.3.3.1. Con: A ban also shows the lack of seriousness with which we value freedom of artistic expression.
1.3.3.2. Pro: A ban could encourage public interaction and the publishing of literature on Hollywood's relationship with minority culture.
1.3.3.2.1. Con: We can create public discussion around sensitive issues without issuing blanket bans on perceived injustices.
1.3.4. Con: There has been little done to reduce misrepresentation in Hollywood in past years. Since Hollywood is mostly [dominated](https://patch.com/california/hollywood/hollywood-whitewashed-white-men-dominate-film-industry-studies-confirm-0) by white middle aged men, forcing the decision upon them might be the only way they may be compelled to act.
1.3.4.1. Con: Today's Hollywood bares little resemblance to the Hollywood of years or even months ago. There is no need to compel Hollywood to comply with policies that they are now complying with as good business and of their own volition. One should only force people to do things overlooking freedom of expression as a last resort.
1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.1.2.1.
1.3.6. Pro: Producers and casting directors could be incentivized to be more inclusive in their casting decisions.
1.3.7. Pro: Audiences can stop supporting movies that whitewash characters, therefore minimizing the revenue and overall incentive for creating such productions.
1.3.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.3.7.2. Pro: Film is an art form.  It is up to the artist to properly express their vision.  It is up to the consumer to decide if they want to support that vision.  No consumers equal no art.
1.3.8. Pro: Producers and casting directors could be educated to being more inclusive and culturally sensitive while casting for certain roles.
1.3.9. Pro: A ban on whitewashing does not mean that races will be displayed with care and sensitivity automatically.
1.3.9.1. Pro: Even though whitewashing is banned, stories will still be told from a white perspective with majority sensibilities in mind.
1.3.9.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.2.
1.3.9.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.2.1.
1.3.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.1.1.
1.4. Con: Its discriminatory to ban white actors from playing non-white characters.
1.4.1. Pro: Banning someone from playing a role which he or she, in real life, does not represent would lead to only gay actors portraying gay characters, and only murderers portraying murderers. Actors create a persona and pretend. An actor who makes the viewer forget who he really is, is the best for the role.
1.4.1.1. Con: This ban would only ban people from playing a role with an immutable characteristic which the actor does not possess.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Only allowing people to act as characters who share characteristics with them belittles the work and training an actor has undergone.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Actors undergo intense training and education in order to portray characters realistically.
1.4.2. Con: White actors are not qualified to portray non-white characters. Therefore, it is not discriminatory to ban white actors from playing non-white characters.
1.4.2.1. Con: This is completely dependant on the importance of a character's ethnicity to their storyline.
1.4.2.2. Con: The human experience is universal. A white actor can portray a non-white character just as well by relating or having experience with the situation being conveyed.
1.4.2.3. Con: Films and movies are not trying to reenact a person's life. They are forms of art and not documentary.
1.4.2.4. Con: That white actors are not qualified to portray non-white roles is an unsubstantiated claim. However, even assuming it is true, we do not ban people from hiring "unqualified" candidates in other fields. There is no justification for ban.
1.4.2.5. Con: Actors are trained to impersonate people with lived experiences different from their own. Insofar as no actor ever has lived the life of the character they are assigned to play, it seems like most actors would be qualified to play a given role in a professional capacity.
1.4.3. Pro: US [law](http://employment.findlaw.com/hiring-process/legal-rights-during-the-hiring-process.html) insists that one's race should not be a qualification for any job.
1.4.3.1. Con: If this law was adhered to properly in Hollywood, the balance between white and non-white actors being cast would be less skewed towards white actors getting majority roles, making a ban less necessary. However, this is not the case.
1.4.3.2. Con: The law that you speak of is created by the same group of people...this does not constitute equal opportunity.
1.4.4. Pro: This act would in fact empower any racist or discriminatory acts as it would give hiring based on skin colour validity.
1.4.5. Con: Whitewashing is a "systematic" form of discrimination.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Whitewashing helps to perpetuate and support a principle that is repeated throughout various other industries and the trickle effect creates larger problems for the Black and Hispanic communities. [Where's the Representation?](http://scholarsarchive.jwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1037&context=ac_symposium)
1.4.5.2. Pro: Whitewashing is a part of the [cycles of oppression](http://www.uas.alaska.edu/juneau/activities/safezone/docs/cycle_oppression.pdf) that plagues minorities in the modern day.
1.4.5.3. Con: Whether it is a form of discrimination or not, discriminating against one group is not the resolution for discrimination against others. It simply continues an oppressive cycle.
1.4.6. Pro: It is extremely racist to ban white people from getting a job because they are white. True equality lies in equal opportunity.
1.4.6.1. Con: It is only when those in power are asked to be considerate of others and feel it threatens their power over others to do so, that racism becomes an issue. This is biased.
1.4.6.2. Con: Hollywood is [historically racist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_early_American_film), often giving opportunity to white actors over non-white actors. A ban will help to equalize these opportunities.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: A ban would likely stop people of any race from playing roles outside their race. This would hurt minority actors, as it would greatly narrow their opportunities.
1.4.6.2.1.1. Con: Whitewashing is the act of casting white actors in the place of minority actors, not the converse. As such, it is unlikely that the number of roles available for minority actors would increase.
1.4.6.2.1.2. Con: Actors of colour aren't playing traditionally white roles in Hollywood films in status quo. If, for example, they were cast in culturally sensitive roles \(say a movie like Schindler's List\) in an appropriative manner, it would make it justified to ban them from playing such characters.
1.4.6.2.1.2.1. Con: Actors of colour are playing culturally sensitive roles in [Les Miserables](http://www.playbill.com/article/hear-the-people-sing-african-american-les-miserables-stars-break-down-broadway-barriers-com-327019) on Broadway, a musical based on historical events in France in the 1800s.
1.4.6.3. Pro: Preventing white people from being cast in these particular jobs just perpetuates the same cycle of oppression, without addressing the real issue, the reason white people are cast to play minority roles ahead of minorities in the first place.
1.4.6.4. Con: Equal opportunity cannot exist in the assessment of a skill as subjective as acting. Given that, production studios and casting companies should prioritise the interests of the public by truly representing the ethnicity of characters in film.
1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.4.6.2.
1.4.8. Pro: Non-white actors are able to portray white characters or other minority groups without incident. The same should be true for the reverse.
1.4.8.1. Con: Non-white actors are also scrutinized for portraying outside their race, like Zoe Saldana was for portraying Nina Simone in the biopic, [Nina](http://time.com/4303134/nina-movie-review-biopic-zoe-saldana/).
1.4.8.1.1. Con: This criticism is justified, since the producers could have cast an equally talented and qualified black woman to play the role of Nina Simone.
1.4.8.1.2. Pro: Zoe Saldana, a Puerto Rican/Dominican actress [came under fire](https://pagesix.com/2016/03/03/zoe-saldana-under-fire-for-black-face-in-nina-simone-biopic/) for wearing 'Blackface' and a prosthetic nose to depict Nina Simone, a Black American woman. This is considered to be a form of whitewashing.
1.4.8.2. Pro: If this ban is to be put in place, then regulations should state that actors should not be able to play a character of a different race if the race is relevant to the story line. This will prevent any inequality in casting now and in the future.
1.4.8.3. Pro: It would be hypocritical to ban white actors from playing traditionally non-white roles, if we are going to welcome non-white actors into traditionally white roles.
1.4.8.4. Pro: The 2004 movie [White Chicks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381707/) featured two Black men 'disguised' as white women. No issues were raised.
1.5. Pro: Whitewashing mitigates the authenticity of media productions.
1.5.1. Con: The people who make movies do not have an obligation to make them authentic. Even if we were to agree that a film's authenticity is a predictor of how good a film it is, we shouldn't use bans to force them to be authentic.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.2.
1.5.3. Pro: Whitewashing prevents young people from every culture from seeing people like themselves represented on screen.
1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.
1.5.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.5.3.3. Pro: Their depiction on screen signals to other ethnicities that they are to remain bit players in the background. That [affects](http://www.shrinktank.com/psychological-impact-whitewashing-asian-characters/) how they perceive of the possibilities for themselves.
1.5.3.4. Con: While whitewashing may contribute to this, the fact that the stories told by Hollywood themselves are not diverse is the main source of a lack of diversity. Banning whitewashing will not fix that.
1.5.3.4.1. Pro: A ban on whitewashing would reduce the diversity of stories told by Hollywood.
1.5.3.4.1.1. Con: A ban on whitewashing would encourage Hollywood to create more diverse stories, written from a variety of minority perspectives instead of from the white perspective.
1.5.3.4.1.1.1. Con: Its unlikely a ban will produce more diverse story lines because it does not resolve the real problem of Hollywood placing higher importance on putting white actors in stories.
1.5.3.4.1.1.2. Con: This ban would impact the actors, not the writers, so it wouldn't affect the perspective of the writer.
1.5.3.4.1.2. Con: Diverse films appeal to a broad audience so there is incentive to still produce diverse films and cast multi-ethnic actors.
1.5.3.4.1.2.1. Pro: Hollywood [of late](http://time.com/4649913/china-remaking-global-film-industry/) has been including Chinese actors and settings in films to appeal to a Chinese audience.
1.5.3.4.1.2.2. Pro: Hollywood is expanding it's business rapidly into international markets such as India and China. It is in the best interests of Hollywood production companies to cast a vast array of actors to capture this new audience.
1.5.3.4.1.2.2.1. Con: [The Great Wall](https://www.gq.com/story/the-great-wall-whitewashing) starred white actor Matt Damon despite being targeted at Chinese audiences. Foreign markets can be equally subject to the star power effect which leads to white actors getting cast instead of ethnically accurate actors.
1.5.3.4.1.3. Con: The diversity of stories is not bound by race, as people from the same race can have different experiences.
1.5.3.4.1.4. Pro: White stars are often inserted into films in which the cast is mostly people of colour in order to make their production feasible.
1.5.3.4.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.3.1.
1.5.3.4.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.5.3.4.1.4.3. Pro: If producers and executives have racial prejudices, then the inclusion of a white actor may make them more likely to green-light a project.
1.5.3.4.1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.5.3.4.1.5. Pro: White stars are cast where casting an actor whose ethnicity matches with the original character would perpetuate negative racial stereotypes.
1.5.3.4.1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.6.2.1.
1.5.3.4.1.5.2. Con: Hollywood writers should write those parts more sensitively instead of erasing ethnic minorities in films.
1.5.3.4.1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.6.2.
1.5.3.4.1.6. Pro: White actors in ethnic roles help increase public awareness of certain cultures, as the plot setting is often still an accurate representation.
1.5.3.4.1.6.1. Pro: Media features and interviews will often draw attention to the original race and cultures of the characters featured within the film.
1.5.3.4.1.6.2. Pro: White actors were cast as [Sokka and Katara](https://www.npr.org/sections/tellmemore/2010/06/29/128196842/the-white-washing-of-a-nickelodeon-hit)  - characters who were originally inspired by indigenous people of the Artic Circle, in M. Knight Shyamalan's adaption of Avatar: The Last Airbender.
1.5.3.4.1.6.2.1. Con: That film was a critical disaster, and is considered one of the worst movies ever made by many. White washing didn't do anything for commercial gain, and this movie poorly represents the film industry as a whole.
1.5.3.4.1.6.3. Con: Since Hollywood and white actors have a great influence, people's opinions of that race or culture become directed by the whitewashed portrayal they have seen on screen. This causes further ignorance, stereotyping or the propagation of offensive narratives in the long run.
1.5.3.4.1.6.4. Con: Awareness of different cultures is counter-productive if the portrayal is misleading, stereotyped or offensive.
1.5.3.4.1.6.4.1. Pro: A viewer exposed to erroneous information about a culture by seeing a whitewashed portrayal of it will be less receptive to accurate descriptions of the culture from other sources.
1.5.3.4.1.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.
1.5.3.4.1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.2.1.
1.5.3.4.1.6.6. Pro: Increasing the public's awareness of different cultures is a worthy goal even if the actors playing the characters are not of that culture's ethnicity.
1.5.3.4.1.6.6.1. Pro: An outright ban on whitewashing could stifle conversation on cultural sensitivity in Hollywood.
1.5.3.4.1.6.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.1.
1.5.3.4.1.6.6.1.2. Con: A ban would not stifle conversation about cultural sensitivity within Hollywood. The opposite would occur. The ban would result in the media and people within the film industry feeling empowered to talk about the issue.
1.5.3.4.1.6.6.2. Con: -> See 1.5.3.4.1.6.4.
1.5.3.4.1.7. Con: The diverse stories still told by Hollywood however would be more authentic. Even if there were less of them, the fact that the ones out there properly represent the culture it portrays would be a positive. Quality above quantity.
1.5.3.4.1.8. Pro: Studios and filmmakers who resent being told how to make their films may intentionally not select diverse stories.
1.5.3.4.1.8.1. Pro: Filmmakers may write original screenplays instead of adapting existing works to avoid accusations of whitewashing.
1.5.3.4.1.8.1.1. Pro: Studios such as Disney have written "original" versions stories to avoid crediting authors  -  for example [The Lion King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfJvKIDS9n8). While for different reasons, it is likely the same tactics could be employed to skirt a whitewashing ban.
1.5.3.4.1.8.2. Con: Filmmakers prone to acting on racial resentments are unlikely to include complex, positive portrayals of people of color in their films in the first place.
1.5.4. Con: Films in their very essence are not authentic. While realism is very important in many films, that is not true for all.
1.5.4.1. Pro: [Suspension of disbelief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief) is an inherent part of movies. It makes sense to extend that to the selection of actors.
1.5.5. Pro: Authenticity when representing a race which has been previously oppressed is very important in showing respect to the experience and people it is depicting.
1.5.5.1. Pro: [Historically](https://medium.com/school-of-doodle/a-history-of-blackface-and-anti-black-propaganda-in-american-cinema-and-television-b4db376b43f2), prejudice against oppressed groups were encouraged through film and theatre. As prejudice still exists today, it is Hollywoods responsibility to make sure that this practise ceases through representing people authentically.
1.5.5.2. Pro: Stereotypes can be damaging and upsetting to people when it creates ingrained racism in the population. Films with inauthentic representations of people of other races can encourage stereotypes.
1.5.5.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.
1.5.5.3. Con: Ethnicity of an actor/actress matching their character does not matter. What does matter is the skill of the former and the respect paid to the latter.
1.5.5.4. Pro: Every day we vote for whitewashing \(or not\). A special care should be taken regarding aggregators including the Hollywood cluster. [www.merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/whitewashing-words-were-watching)
1.5.5.5. Con: Individuals who decide who to cast in movies do not owe a duty to past oppression.
1.5.5.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.
1.5.5.5.2. Con: The act of whitewashing makes these individuals complicit in modern day oppression and hence, they should be culpable for their actions.
1.5.6. Con: Film makers alter the original source material that they turn into films frequently. "Authenticity" is less important than making an accessible, high quality film.
1.5.6.1. Con: The fact that filmmakers do alter source material does not equate to the fact that authenticity is less important in cinema. That would be completely dependent on the film maker's goal.
1.5.6.2. Con: Making a high quality film can be the result of casting [authentic people](https://filmmakerfreedom.com/blog/filmmaking-authenticity-casting-non-actors), as is the case when casting non-actors in certain films.
1.5.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.6.1.1.
1.5.7. Con: Advanced makeup techniques often make it impossible for audiences to tell if the character is being depicted by a white actor. Thus, from the audiences perspective, whitewashing does not detract from the films authenticity.
1.5.7.1. Con: Advances in makeup techniques do not make "black-face" or "yellow-face" practices acceptable. The believability of the costume was never the issue with this practice, and so affects it in no way.
1.6. Con: It is difficult to have a singular legal definition of whitewashing. Therefore a ban would be ineffective.
1.6.1. Pro: As race is socially constructed, it means different things to different people. As a result, there is no clear line which courts can use to differentiate what is and isn't whitewashing.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Hollywood studios, such as [Disney](https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/sites/americanlawyer/2017/12/14/big-law-helping-homer-and-mickey-tie-knot-in-disney-fox-deal/?slreturn=20180217210123), have immense legal resources. So long as whitewashing remains a subjective definition, it is likely that they could use those legal resources to avoid being affected by the ban.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Even if studios win a majority of these cases, there is still inherent value in bringing these cases through the justice system.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Pro: Legal battles are expensive and very bad for a studio's public relations. This creates a direct incentive for studios to not produce material that could be interpretted as being whitewashed.
1.6.1.1.1.2. Pro: Even if studios win legal battles, this ban creates useful public discourse on whitewashing as a systemic problem in the entertainment world - a conversation that is currently just swept under the rug.
1.6.1.1.2. Pro: Independent films are more likely to have racially diverse casts and crews. However, they would also be the films more likely to be targeted by such legislation. The proposed ban has larger potential for a chilling effect on creativity in indies than in major studio blockbusters.
1.6.1.2. Pro: It would be unfair if actors who were underprivileged and had experienced racial discrimination were excluded from roles because they did not meet an exact racial profile demanded by the law.
1.6.1.3. Con: There are some cases where it is clear that characters have been whitewashed due to commercial reasons. It is feasible and justified to enforce a ban in those cases.
1.6.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.3.2.
1.6.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.4.1.6.2.
1.6.1.3.3. Con: It is almost impossible to legally verify a studio's reasons for whitewashing. Casting is a subjective and complex process to which many individuals contribute.  Furthermore, when studios are whitewashing for commercial reasons, they have an incentive to obfuscate that reasoning.
1.6.1.4. Pro: For some, it would be whitewashing to have a lighter skinned black person portraying a person who had a darker skin tone in real life. For others, this would not be the case.
1.6.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.1.2.
1.6.2. Pro: The definition of whitewashing used in this debate refers to roles meant for non-white actors being played by white actors. In order for this definition to apply, the race of a character would have to be specifically defined in source material. This is not the case for many of the most egregious examples of whitewashing. Therefore, a ban would be ineffective.
1.6.2.1. Pro: Over [half](https://stephenfollows.com/many-movies-based-real-life-events/) of Hollywood films are based on original screenplays already. Roles within these screenplays cannot be considered "meant" for non-white actors if the opposite is specified in the script. This is true even if the film is set in a non-white dominated setting or tells a story relevant to people of colour.
1.6.2.2. Con: Many of the most contentious cases of whitewashing have involved historical figures, including some of the examples given in the overview of this claim. For these individuals, their race/ethnicity is a matter of public record and so no ambiguity remains.
1.6.3. Con: [Whitewashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewashing_in_film) is defined as a casting practice in the film industry in which a white actor is cast in a historically non-white character role.
1.6.3.1. Con: Many instances of racial appropriation which are often called whitewashing could not be fit into this definition.
1.6.3.1.1. Pro: Matt Damon's character in [The Great Wall](https://www.gq.com/story/the-great-wall-whitewashing) cannot be said to have been historically non-white. It is an original screenplay and based in an alternate version of history. A new, entirely made-up character has no race to be whitewashed.
1.6.3.2. Con: In many cases what constitutes historically white and non-white is disputed. Depictions of Cleopatra, for instance.
1.6.4. Con: -> See 1.6.1.3.
1.6.5. Pro: Establishing a legally binding definition of an individual's racial identity that can be used to make hiring decisions sets a dangerous precedent. Existing nondiscrimination laws take advantage of individual self-report, but a proposed ban would only function with an objective definition of race to compare the actor and character against.
1.6.6. Con: Not all legal definitions have to be singular. Sub-categories of whitewashing can also be taken under legal consideration.
1.7. Con: A ban on whitewashing is unconstitutional.
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.4.1.2.
1.7.2. Con: The continuance of whitewashing can be seen as unconstitutional, as it allows the free speech of one group while indirectly silencing the right of another to correctly portray their own.
1.7.2.1. Con: This relies on an interpretation of the First Amendment recognizing a group right to “portray themselves”, a right that has never even been considered by courts.
1.7.2.2. Con: The right of a group to “correctly portray itself” is ambiguous and impossible to measure.
1.7.2.3. Con: The other group can portray itself however it sees fit. It just can't demand the use of someone else's stage and microphone to do it.
1.7.3. Pro: Characters are created not born, and as such are protected speech.
1.7.4. Con: It isn't specified if such a ban would be self-imposed by the industry, but if it were, the constitution would not prohibit such an action provided that it's enforcement were purely hegemonic.
1.8. Pro: Whitewashing is offensive.
1.8.1. Con: Acting, by its very nature, often requires actors to pretend to have different character traits, or to pretend to belong to a different social class. Playing a character that belongs to a different race is analogous to this. It isn't offensive.
1.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.
1.8.1.2. Con: One cannot accurately portray the part of a person of a another race by merely reading up on how that race behaves. Attempting to do so is offensive.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: By this logic, almost any role an actor plays could be considered offensive to some segment of the population. As long as the actors and director make a good faith effort to show characteristics that are important for the story and success of the movie, acting cannot be considered inherently offensive.
1.8.1.2.2. Con: The statement "how that race behaves" assumes that there is a singular way that all members of a race behave and that there is no overlap between individuals within different groups. Besides being demonstrably false, this is actually a justification for prejudice and discrimination. Viewing people in terms of their racial group, rather as individuals, leads to stereotyping and racism.
1.8.2. Con: By portraying characters from other races white actors are demonstrating that it is possible for human beings that belong to different cultures and races to empathize with and understand each other.
1.8.2.1. Con: The demonstration attempted by white people is in itself offensive. Regardless of how they try, it is impossible for them to be in the shoes of a character they cannot fully comprehend.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: Most actors, regardless of their race, have very different lives to those of the characters they play. For example, a middle class African American who plays the role of a slave in a film, is very unlikely to have directly experienced the same kind of discrimination as that of the character that they play.
1.8.2.1.2. Pro: Discrimination is felt through decades of nature and nurture. It is much like walking up to a person of color and saying 'I know how you feel'. That is impossible.
1.8.2.1.2.1. Con: Shared humanity allows us to understand and empathize with each other. This can be difficult when we have vastly different experiences. However, while race may play a part in our experiences, it is only one factor among many.
1.8.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Race still remains one of the biggest divisive factors, resulting in a wider gap of relative experience.
1.8.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: This varies greatly based on the situation. That many people live and work together in multicultural communities, form in interracial relationships, or are themselves of mixed raced, shows that race is not always largely divisive.
1.8.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Social class](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorrison/2016/05/31/its-not-race-thats-the-big-divide-its-wealth/#1b4d664d7639) is a bigger divisive factor than race.
1.8.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This does not make racial devisiveness unimportant or not worth regulating.
1.8.2.1.3. Con: This claim assumes the lived experiences of every white person. White actors who are members of other minority groups may have a nuanced view of discrimination, which could inform their acting, even through it doesn't come from a place of race.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Indeed, banning whitewashing, furthers the idea that individuals of different races can not understand each other. This is a harmful and divisive narrative for society to promote.
1.8.2.3. Con: This becomes disrespectful when these white actors are cast specifically at the expense of their non-white counterparts.
1.8.2.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.3.2.
1.8.3. Con: It is likely most people are not offended by whitewashing, or see it as a big enough problem to ban.
1.8.3.1. Con: If we are looking for equality then it is important we represent both the majority and minorities in the film industry.
1.8.3.2. Con: By excluding a group of people from a certain role that they should inherently get priority to, we are therefore restricting progress in Hollywood because now we are ignoring the importance of authenticity in film.
1.8.3.3. Con: Democracy implies that the people's will must be adopted, but not when a minority is targeted or offended.
1.8.3.4. Con: Whitewashed portraits of leaders were employed since ancient times to establish the authority and status of a dominant ethnic group in the collective mindset in such a way that it obscures the achievements of other ethnic groups from popular culture, ultimately erasing their history.
1.8.3.5. Pro: If it were offensive to the majority, than people would not see these movies. That they are still being made indicates it is not that big a problem.
1.8.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.2.
1.8.3.5.2. Con: Racism still exists despite being a major problem. That these movies are still being made is no indication they are acceptable.
1.8.3.6. Pro: The people who are worst effected by whitewashing are systemically oppressed and fewer in number than the white majority that Hollywood caters to. This makes it difficult for them to voice their offence.
1.8.4. Pro: Whitewashing is a form of cultural appropriation.
1.8.4.1. Pro: Systematic whitewashing dislocates stories from their cultural context and reduces their artistic authenticity, and so their cultural value. In doing this we all loose out as culture's ability to transform us, and our society is also reduced.
1.8.4.2. Pro: Whitewashing allows white actors to profit from the experiences and cultures of people of colour, while excluding actors of colour from those roles and their associated profits.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: People of a given ethnicity do not have more of a claim over the stories of a person from that same ethnicity than a white person just because they share a similar skin tone.
1.8.4.3. Con: Cultural appropriation is not a regrettable phenomenon.
1.8.4.3.1. Con: Cultural appropriation is analogous to copyright violations. Even if a white actor can play an actor of colour well, they do not have the right to do so.
1.8.4.3.1.1. Con: Copyright is given to an individual, not an ethnicity, that creates a cultural work. It is therefore not analogous.
1.8.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: Individuals of a certain ethnicity have no claim over the cultural work of others of the same ethnicity just because they share the same skin colour.
1.8.4.3.1.1.2. Con: The principle of copyright which lies in sanctifying ideas could be extended to race too.
1.8.4.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Race is a social construction not an individual one. Therefore, no one person can own the culture that comes from belonging to a particular race, as it is a collective experience.
1.8.4.3.1.2. Con: If using the analogy of the copyright violations, then ownership of cultural ideas and traditions have to be assigned to those in history who created those ideas/traditions and not simply those in the present who share their skin color or ethnicity.
1.8.4.3.2. Pro: Appropriation is one of the most common and effective ways for a culture to get accepted into mainstream society.
1.8.4.3.2.1. Pro: Portrayals of the cultures of ethnic minorities by white actors can introduce white audiences to those cultures. Those audiences are then more likely to gradually come to accept that culture as a whole and eventually actors of that ethnicity playing roles in movies about those cultures.
1.8.4.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.3.4.1.6.4.
1.8.4.3.3. Pro: America itself is created through cultural appropriation as it is a melting pot of cultures. To keep all ethnicities separate would create a "us and them" mentality which is harmful.
1.8.4.3.3.1. Con: America however is built on, and still operates from a place of [white superiority](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/13/america-white-supremacy-hooked-drug-charlottesville-virginia). This is what keeps races separate, as whitewashing benefits from other cultural experiences without allow those experiences to be displayed by those authentically experiencing them.
1.8.4.3.4. Pro: No one owns culture, as it is necessarily shared between people and shaped by each person who interacts with it. White actors are just another party contributing to the sharing of that culture when they play a whitewashed role.
1.8.4.3.4.1. Con: Whitewashing is not necessary in order to effectively contribute to sharing another's culture.
1.8.4.3.4.2. Con: Whitewashing is not about individual cases of selected to share culture, but the systematic abuse that stems from privilege.
1.8.4.3.5. Con: Cultural appropriation means that the experiences of people of colour are seen through the eyes of a privileged group, rather than being able to speak for themselves.
1.8.4.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.2.1.
1.8.4.3.5.2. Con: This assumes that cultural appropriation decreases the opportunities for people of colour to speak for themselves. Cultural appropriation gives a platform to build familiarity with these cultures and thereby increase overall interaction and understanding, even if a proportion of that interaction is cultural appropriated material.
1.8.4.3.5.2.1. Con: Cultural appropriation does just this, as it is a dynamic of power in which a dominant group takes elements of culture from a systematically oppressed group. Familiarity with an oppressed group cannot be accurately conveyed if it is only shared from the perspective of the group oppressing them.
1.8.5. Con: Many classic Hollywood films used whitewashing. These films were produced in a different time and era. It is wrong to impose modern standards of morality onto art which was produced in a different era.
1.8.5.1. Pro: It is important to remember that formerly black people were not allowed to take part in regular life, which implies, for example, being part of the cast of a film.
1.8.5.1.1. Con: Just because some productions took place in the era of enslavement or segregation does not mean whitewashing in those movies ought not be criticised.
1.8.5.2. Con: Just because some productions took place in the era of enslavement or segregation does not mean whitewashing, as a practice ought exist today.
1.8.5.2.1. Con: A ban on whitewashing would soon be followed by a ban on whitewashed films from prior eras, and people would begin to "whitewash" the history of Hollywood.
1.8.5.3. Con: Films which were produced in a different time cannot be changed. They already exist whether a ban is put in place or not. This ban would only impose modern standards of morality on art to be made in the future.
1.8.6. Pro: The justifications used by directors for whitewashing are often racist and offensive.
1.8.6.1. Pro: For example, the director Ridley Scott [defended](https://medium.com/\@DavidDWrites/ridley-scotts-explanation-for-whitewashing-his-exodus-movie-is-infuriating-8d36bd555ada) his decision to whitewash by saying  " I can’t mount a film of this budget … and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such. "
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: This justification is offensive because it states that current prejudice within society, justifies excluding people of color from opportunities that they deserve.
1.8.7. Con: Labeling whitewashing as offensive is problematic because it discourages audiences from viewing culturally significant films that use the technique. Even if the film has significant artistic merit.
1.8.7.1. Con: Artistic merit is not as important as authenticity when producing a film of cultural significance, particularly if the context is of historical value.
1.8.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.8.9. Pro: Whitewashing is disrespectful to the original author of the work on which the movie screenplay is based.
1.8.9.1. Con: Authors' of works choose to sign away the film rights to filmmakers. They can stipulate within those contracts how they want the adaption to be cast.
1.8.9.1.1. Pro: Original authors can be consulted with while making casting decisions.
1.8.9.1.1.1. Pro: J.K. Rowling had only British and Irish actors cast in the film adaptions of [Harry Potter.](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/02/robin-williams-rejected-for-harry-potter-role-thanks-to-british-only-rule)
1.8.9.1.2. Con: Authors of an ethnic minority already have difficulty getting their works adapted. They may not have the leverage in negotiations to make such stipulations.
1.8.9.1.2.1. Con: This is a reason to structurally empower minority writers, not to ban whitewashing.
1.8.9.1.2.2. Con: Even if assumed to be true, this is actually a reason to NOT ban whitewashing. By placing more restrictions on the filmmakers, they may be less willing to adapt works including ethnic minorities.
1.8.9.1.2.3. Pro: Currently authors of colour face a [collective action problem](https://www.britannica.com/topic/collective-action-problem-1917157). It is in the interests of no one author to attach conditions to the adaption of their work and thereby make it less attractive to studios. However, if all works by such authors come with such stipulations, no one author is forced to stand out.
1.8.9.2. Con: Not all authors of the original source material will be offended by whitewashing.
1.8.9.3. Con: Producers and directors typically have the right to make or order changes to screenplays. These changes might be disrespectful to the screenwriter, but that doesn't mean they should be banned.
1.8.9.4. Pro: A written work is an extension of the writer's expression and personality, both of which are extremely personal. Changing important characteristics of the work in order to make it fit the needs of a movie script is insulting to the original vision.
1.8.9.4.1. Con: The beauty of art is that it can take on various forms and have things changed while retaining the original meaning. When writers agree to have their work adapted for the screen it is unwritten that it will be mostly changed in some way or form.
1.8.9.4.1.1. Pro: Most written works while adapted to the big screen are changed in one way or another.
1.8.10. Pro: Whitewashing is another way for those in power \(generally, white people\) to put their power on display.
1.8.10.1. Pro: Hollywood continuing to not to employ black actors helps to solidify the belief that there are no qualified black actors.
1.8.11. Con: Offence is a subjective and immeasurable. It is therefore not a reasonable basis on which to ban whitewashing.
1.8.11.1. Con: In this case, the offence regardless of how subjective it is has been felt by people of color as evidenced by the [#OscarsSoWhite](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/02/02/oscars-academy-award-nominations-diversity/79645542/) movement. Running subjectivity is irrelevant, since proof of offence exists.
1.8.11.1.1. Con: That there is "proof of offense" is not a reasonable criteria for banning something. If that were the case, practically everything could be banned by simply showing that someone was offended by it.
1.8.11.2. Con: -> See 1.6.1.3.
1.8.11.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.
1.9. Pro: Whitewashing overlooks actors and directors of color in a field already lacking in diversity.
1.9.1. Con: It is unfair to claim that a person of color could have played the role instead. It is sometimes exceptionally hard for directors and producers to find someone who has the same characteristics as the character in the original source material.
1.9.1.1. Con: This is true in smaller artist communities, however Hollywood and Broadway have a huge range of actors to choose from and a [diverse](http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/neighborhood/hollywood/) population.
1.9.1.1.1. Pro: In Hollywood white people make up only [41%](http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/neighborhood/hollywood/) of the population.
1.9.1.1.2. Con: The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences members were 94 percent white and 77 percent male in 2012 and 94 percent of studio heads are white and 100 percent male in 2015. With such [little diversity](http://www.dw.com/en/how-white-is-hollywood/a-18990973) in the upper levels of Hollywood there may not much diversity in the acting community.
1.9.1.1.2.1. Con: The Academy is obviously especially ill equipped to address this topic. The Academy is not the only pool of actors.
1.9.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Since The Academy is widely respected as the highest circle in the movie industry, its lack of diversity is worth noting.
1.9.1.2. Pro: For example, Angelina Jolie played the character Mariane Pearl in the film a 'A Mighty Heart.' Mariane Pearl was French-born and Afro-Chinese-Cuban-Dutch.  It would have been exceptionally difficult for the director of the film to find an actress who had identical racial characteristics to [Mariane Pearl](http://www.indiewire.com/2016/02/the-20-worst-examples-of-hollywood-whitewashing-268110/).
1.9.1.2.1. Con: A ban on white washing would not mean that directors would have to have an actress who identically matches their characters race. In the situation mentioned, either an actress of Asian decent or an actress of colour would have been acceptable to hire.
1.9.2. Pro: A study by the Directors Guild of America found that ethnic minority and women directors [continue to be overlooked](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/study-women-ethnic-minority-directors-920329) in television.
1.9.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.1.1.
1.9.2.2. Pro: Of first time episode directors,[one study](https://www.dga.org/News/PressReleases/2016/160817-DGA-Study-Women-and-Ethnic-Minorities-Overlooked-for-First-Breaks-in-TV-Directing.aspx) showed only 14% are of a minority race, while 19% are women.
1.9.3. Pro: Minority actors are often [overlooked](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/14/black-actors-overlooked-worse-ethnic-minorities-asian-racial-stereotypes) for roles outside of racial stereotypes.
1.9.3.1. Pro: [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/hollywood-whitewashing-outcry-as-gladiator-writer-says-he-wants-to-cast-leonardo-dicaprio-as-persian-a7070381.html), for example, has been cast to portray the Persian Muslim poet Jalaluddin al-Rumi, amid disapproval due to many Muslim actors being overlooked, or instead given terrorist roles to play.
1.9.4. Pro: A [study](http://www.aapacnyc.org/uploads/1/1/9/4/11949532/aapac_2014-2015_report.pdf) found that white actors were cast in 78% of the roles on New York stages even though the census estimates the white population of the city to 44%. This demonstrates that white actors are hired a disproportionate amount compared to actors of other ethnicities.
1.9.5. Con: This is not just about colour. In Black Panther, the African superhero is played by an American. \(As are most of the main characters\). That totally overlooks the large number of African actors who could \(should\) have acted in it, and is basically discrimination \(non-inclusion\) against Africans by Hollywood.
1.9.5.1. Con: Having Black Americans play the roles in Black Panther is still comparitively better than having white actors play the parts.
1.9.5.2. Con: Nationality is not the same as race. Chadwick Boseman, the actor that portrayed King T'Challa in Black Panther is from the United States, however his race is of African descent. Therefore, this is not discrimination.
1.9.5.3. Con: Hollywood is an American industry. While it is important to represent different races on screen, it is obviously easier in America for them to find American actors who are of this race as Africans represent only [3.3%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_immigration_to_the_United_States) of immigrants entering America.
1.9.5.3.1. Con: By this logic, it is easier for Hollywood to find and cast white American actors over other races since White Americans make up over 70% of the population. Therefore whitewashing, wouldn't need to be banned, as its simply casting who is most available.
1.9.6. Con: A ban could backfire. When you place a legal ban on white actors playing actors of color, it may also prevent actors of color from playing white characters. Jewish or Muslim actors could be prevented from playing Christians. LGBTQ actors could be prevented from being able to play heteronormative characters.
1.9.6.1. Con: This is not necessarily a bad thing. Having more authenticity in Hollywood could be a positive change for the industry and how it is viewed in society.
1.9.6.1.1. Pro: Hollywood is known to distort history, passing it off as truth. Having more authenticity can help its credibility in at least one aspect.
1.9.6.1.1.1. Pro: The book '[History by Hollywood: The Use and Abuse of the American Past](https://books.google.com/books?id=rKuAxbE5ErkC&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=hollywood+distorts+history&source=bl&ots=SwyqcKB0u0&sig=YwIhQgpl5rrncfgO1S2Z3J4_mvc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF7NT92PTZAhVG7VMKHbwqA6U4ChDoAQhWMAg#v=onepage&q=hollywood%20distorts%20history&f=false)', gives examples of several Hollywood movies like Mississippi Burning that give inaccurate portrays of minorities in historically based films. \(pg-34-35\)
1.9.6.1.1.2. Pro: [Pocahontas](https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/history/genealogy/true-story-pocahontas-historical-myths-versus-sad-reality/) romanticises the story of a historical figure, who in reality was kidnapped and raped.
1.9.6.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.2.3.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.5.3.4.1.
