Discussion Title: Do Aliens Exist?

1. Alien life has existed or does exist.
1.1. Pro: If [multiverse theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse) is true, by necessity there is more than one Earth and thus, more than one human species.
1.1.1. Con: The theory of the multiverse is incompatible with the common concept of existence \(the existence of something in a comprehensible point in space and time\). We do not discuss if there are aliens in hypothetical universes but if they exist within the spectrum of the observable reality.
1.1.2. Con: Even if multiple universes exist we have no way of interacting with them and therefore should not be considered in this discussion.
1.2. Pro: The [Simulation Theory](https://www.kialo.com/do-we-exist-within-a-simulated-reality-9858) claims we exist as digital lifeforms within a network of information technology, if true, this indicates the existence of Extra Terrestrial Life.
1.2.1. Con: Unless humans are running the simulation.
1.3. Con: Humans have not discovered any evidence supporting the existence of aliens.
1.3.1. Pro: In the absence of proof, claims of intelligent life are as meaningless as claims of the existence of God. Without proof in the affirmative, it is the duty of critical thinkers to reject notions of extraterrestrial life. Same goes for the supposition that a supreme deity exists.
1.3.2. Pro: The default position is to not believe a claim until it can been demonstrated to be true. This is not to say that the belief should be considered false.
1.3.3. Con: The technology available today might not be sufficient to detect alien life.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Aliens may be transmitting signals that are not detectable with human senses or technology.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: There could exist senses beyond the five that we possess that are needed to detect some forms of life.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: They may be using other - possibly more evolved - means of communicating, which humans are just not equipped to detect.
1.3.3.1.2.1. Pro: There are [limits](http://phys.org/news/2015-06-strange-behavior-quantum-particles-parallel.html) to human perception.
1.3.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: Human perception is open to only a [tiny share](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electromagnetic-Spectrum.png) of the whole electromagnetic spectrum.
1.3.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Humanity has already put [various satellites](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum_observatories1.html) into space that can see beyond the visible spectrum and recognize - for example - radio, micro and X-Ray waves.
1.3.3.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Humans are still only capable of interpreting the data within the limits of their cognitive capabilities and comprehension.
1.3.3.1.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.2.1.1.1.
1.3.3.1.2.2. Pro: They may be using forms of mass and energy \(e.g. [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter)\) or [particles](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/is-particle-physics-about-to-crack-wide-open/) that are yet unknown to and undetectable for humans for communication.
1.3.3.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.2.1.1.
1.3.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: Dark matter is estimated to make up about [27%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) of the universe; dark energy to make up [68%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy) of its energy. Alien life could exist in either of the two - although neither is visible to humans, even with the help of technology.
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: Radio transmission has been used only for 100 years by humankind and may soon by replaced by more advanced technologies. An alien civilisation could similarly have used radio for only or a short time or even never.
1.3.3.1.3.1. Pro: A particular range of radio frequencies, those in the so-called [Microwave Window](http://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/seti-observations), are assumed to be highly useful for interstellar communication.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Although there have been significant progress in observation efforts, we still are a long way of being able to detect non-intelligent life on most planets.
1.3.3.3. Pro: There is no reason to assume all habitable planets would produce individually conscious organisms. Our individuality is likely an anomaly resulting from our tribalism leading to a strategic need for "channels" of communication. In the absence of individual consciousness, it seems to me that radio communications would also not result. Point being, radio astronomy will not find anything even if there is life on other planets.
1.3.4. Pro: After analyzing thousands of [galaxies](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/15/search-for-alien-life-100000-galaxies_n_7063232.html) with NASA’s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer \(WISE\) space telescope, Penn State researchers could not find any evidence of alien civilizations on the basis of the emitted heat a highly developed civilization's energy supply would cause.
1.3.4.1. Con: We have no reason to expect that life elsewhere would reach the same level of development as ours at the same time as ours. The results of this study indicate a lack of civilization within the area studied, but not necessarily the lack of life within that area.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: Civilizations do not need to exist at the same time as ours to be observed. If we look one million lightyears in all directions from Earth, we have an entire volume that only needs to have had life in the last million years. If we look two million lightyears away we have a sphere 8 times the volume and 4 times the surface area. Our [telescopes](https://scitechdaily.com/hubblecast-video-explains-hubble-looks-back-time/) look several billion lightyears away, observing a huge span of space and time.
1.3.4.2. Con: The thesis states "alien life", not "intelligent alien life in an industrial age". The introductory blurb goes so far as to identify single-celled life forms in its definition of life. Such life forms would not have signals we could detect with current equipment.
1.3.4.3. Con: It's likely that an advanced civilisation would have highly efficient technology that would not lead to massive amounts of waste heat.
1.3.4.4. Con: This was a [search for extremely-advanced Type III civilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#Observational_evidence), and does not rule out Type II or lower civilizations. \(Humanity is Type 0, and alien life could exist without even being an intelligent civilization.\)
1.3.4.5. Pro: While it's true that we can dream up various reasons why we don't see aliens in these kinds of observations, at the end of the day we are left with the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox): why is the sky not teeming with aliens? These astronomical observations deepen the Paradox.
1.3.4.5.1. Con: The fact that the sky \(and the known galaxy\) is not teaming with aliens doesn't show that aliens don't exist. Because we don't know how big the universe is, we don't know the percentage of the universe has been searched. This means that this data is meaningless.
1.3.4.5.2. Con: The Fermi paradox is built on a strictly materialist ontology. It holds no sway either way about lifeforms with technologies so advanced that they may be deemed as godlike by us.
1.3.4.5.3. Pro: According to the [Fermi Paradox](http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec28.html) there is a contradiction between the lack of evidence and high probability estimates.
1.3.4.5.3.1. Pro: The probability of alien life is not just a function of the number of planets, but also of the probability of life developing on those planets. Although we know that the first number is colossal, the second number may be so small that the existence of aliens becomes very unlikely.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1. Con: Scientific evidence points to a high probability that a multitude of celestial bodies in our solar system alone can support organic life or might have been able to do so in the past.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.1. Pro: [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars) most probably once had habitable atmosphere and still has liquid water reservoirs.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: [Recent scientific evidence](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44952710) suggests that there is a permanently existing body of liquid water on Mars under the planet's south polar ice cap.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: In 2015, a [team of scientists](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6231/218.abstract) estimated that about 4.5 billion years ago at least one-fifth of [Mars was covered in an ocean](http://www.businessinsider.com/evidence-for-life-on-other-planets-2015-9/#earlier-this-year-a-team-of-scientists-estimated-that-about-45-billion-years-ago-at-least-one-fifth-of-mars-was-covered-in-an-ocean-more-than-450-feet-deep-any-signs-of-life-that-swam-in-these-waters-could-therefore-be-hidden-in-the-martian-soil-1) more than 450 feet deep. Such a water formation makes it highly possible that forms of life existed and are now hidden in the Martian soil.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: Scientists found that water had existed on Mars for [200 million years longer](http://www.businessinsider.com/evidence-for-life-on-other-planets-2015-9/#earlier-this-year-a-team-of-scientists-estimated-that-about-45-billion-years-ago-at-least-one-fifth-of-mars-was-covered-in-an-ocean-more-than-450-feet-deep-any-signs-of-life-that-swam-in-these-waters-could-therefore-be-hidden-in-the-martian-soil-1) than previously thought, so there was more than enough time for the development of life.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.1.3. Pro: Scientists found[indirect, but strong evidence of past life on Mars](https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/nasa1.html) in a meteorite that fell to Earth. If life exists on Mars now, it would have to be [beneath the surface](https://www.popsci.com/bacteria-mars), but there are [plans of finding out](https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/651453/NASA-s-Mars-mission-will-see-them-dig-beneath-the-surface-to-look-for-signs-of-ALIEN-LIFE).
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.2. Pro: [Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Titan) has some environmental properties that theoretically make life possible.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.2.1. Pro: Besides Earth, Saturn's largest moon [Titan](http://www.businessinsider.com/evidence-for-life-on-other-planets-2015-9/#in-addition-to-those-on-europa-and-enceladus-vast-subsurface-oceans-could-exist-on-at-least-a-dozen-objects-in-our-solar-system-planetary-scientists-suspect-the-problem-with-detecting-life-on-any-of-these-is-reaching-the-watery-mantle-that-exists-hundreds-of-miles-underground-7) is the only body in the solar system with lakes on its surface. Although these lakes are made of liquid methane and not water, life is possible.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Methane-based, oxygen-free living cells [could exist](https://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/02/life-not-we-know-it-possible-saturns-moon-titan).
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.3. Pro: [Enceladus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus#Potential_habitability) has warm water geysers that point to a possible life supporting environment.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: A different team of researchers confirmed the existence of water by giving additional evidence of the presence of [hydrothermal vents](http://www.businessinsider.com/active-hydrothermal-vents-on-enceladus-2015-3).
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.4. Pro: [Callisto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callisto_%28moon%29#Potential_habitability) has subsurface oceans that probably could support life.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.5. Pro: [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_\(moon\)#Potential_habitability) has an abundance of liquid water in under-ice oceans that are likely candidates for hosting life.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.6. Con: How life was kick-started on Earth has still not been [completely discovered](http://www.livescience.com/1804-greatest-mysteries-life-arise-earth.html). Unless we know this, we can hardly make any claims about whether other celestial bodies have conditions that are not only necessary but sufficient for organic life.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.6.1. Con: It is hardly a complete mystery - we've had a decent understanding of the general process since the [Miller-Urey experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment) in 1952.
1.3.4.5.3.1.1.6.1.1. Con: It is necessary to know all the steps in a process - and the chances of them happening - in order to determine its chances of occurring. Experiments so far, including [Miller's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller–Urey_experiment), suggest mechanisms for only one step in an unknown process. A single unknown step with an essentially nil chance of occurring relative to the size of the universe would change the conclusion.
1.3.4.5.3.2. Con: The Fermi Paradox accepts that great barriers could have forced historic high intellect alien life forms to become extant, however it does allow for both historic highly intelligent aliens and life forms of low intellect which could currently be present.
1.3.4.5.3.3. Con: Enrico Fermi was in fact commenting not on the existence of aliens \(which he believed to exist\) but on the difficulties of star travel. Consider this was circa 1950, man had not yet put its first probe into orbit. Even reaching the moon seemed incredibly out of reach.
1.3.4.5.3.4. Pro: The Fermi Paradox is explainable by "[The Rare Earth Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis)": If life were probable, we'd expect to find more evidence. If intelligent life were probable, we'd almost certainly have already been visited by aliens.
1.3.4.5.3.4.1. Con: There are approximately 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe. Even using the most conservative of estimates from Rare Earth Hypothesis, the probabilities that life doesn't exist on at least 1 other planet in one of those galaxies is almost nil. Human impact on the universe has not permeated a vast majority of that space; therefore there is no reason for intelligent life in other galaxies to seek out humans on Earth.[physics.org](http://www.physics.org/facts/sand-galaxies.asp)
1.3.5. Con: According to the [Rare Earth Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis), Earth's circumstances are so rare it is conceivable that alien civilizations will be far away. This makes it very difficult to communicate or meet them even if they exist.
1.3.5.1. Con: The Rare Earth hypothesis assumes that galactic regions that are suitable for life are rare. By this logic, there is no reason why other life-supporting planets might not actually be very close. After all, our galactic region is apparently suitable for them.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: True random distribution will result in some clusters close together.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Con: That does not mean that we are in such a cluster.
1.3.5.1.1.2. Con: In the context of the universe's vastness, even clusters might be characterized by distances between their individual elements that make communication next to impossible.
1.3.5.2. Pro: Even if another planet was capable of life, 1\) rational life would have to develop and 2\) that rational life would have to be able to maintain a civilization. There are a large number of reasons why other extraterrestrials would not be 1\) rational or 2\) organized into a civilization.
1.3.6. Con: Alien civilizations could actively hide for good reasons.
1.3.6.1. Con: Any advancement civilization could understand that more primitive life \(like humans\) exists and would have nothing to fear from such creatures and would have no reason not to communicate.
1.3.6.2. Pro: There could be highly advanced and developed predators out there constantly looking for resources and food sources.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: While their prey might therefore hide, this would not be a reason for them to hide.
1.3.6.3. Pro: The first contact of an alien civilization with another might have ended in disaster, so they might do their best to never let this event happen again.
1.3.6.3.1. Con: This assumes all such civilisations have had such an experience and made such a decision.
1.3.6.4. Pro: An advanced alien civilisation could be protecting us as an “natural reservation project”, as we do with humans deep in the Amazons or with endangered animals.
1.3.6.5. Con: All advanced civilisations should be grounded in science and that requires curiosity and a lust to explore the unknown. Therefore it would be impossible for them to keep their hands away from us.
1.3.6.6. Pro: Seeing how much people hate and kill one another, it’s no wonder why aliens have been firmly avoiding establishing a contact with us and have only been observing us from afar.
1.3.6.7. Pro: A lack of evidence is not proof. Lui's 'dark forest theory' suggests civilisations' primary desire is to survive and that all resources are finite. Inevitable trust issues lead to conflict between civilisations advanced enough to meet each other. Thus, the universe is filled with intelligent life keeping quiet to avoid potential destruction.[China’s ‘Dark Forest’ Answer to ‘Star Wars’ Optimism](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/lovesick-cyborg/2015/10/31/chinas-dark-forest-answer-to-star-wars-optimism/#.Wmj8MJP1VcA)
1.3.7. Con: To move from the fact that we haven't found definitive proof of aliens to the inference that aliens do not exist is a fallacious appeal to ignorance.
1.3.7.1. Pro: The fact that we have no evidence that something does exist does not lead to the conclusion that it does not. For example, up to around 100 years ago, we had no evidence for the existence of many sub-atomic particles. That simply meant that we had not developed the technology to identify them.
1.3.7.2. Pro: First, take away the assumption that we even know what to look for yet. also take away the idea that we know how the ecology, biology and technology will look like. we have barely scratched the surface looking at the tiny corner of space that we reside in with our own physical and psychological limitations for a very short duration in time.
1.3.7.3. Con: Although the lack of evidence is not decisive, we are justified in refusing to agree to the proposition until some evidence is provided.
1.3.7.4. Pro: Because we have not observed alien life does not mean it does not exist. If that were true then microscopic life would not exist because we can not see it without the aid of specialized equipment. The simple fact we have not detected alien life could be the equipment needed to observe alien life has not been designed.
1.3.7.4.1. Con: The fallacy undermines this argument. By this logic, because we have not observed God does not mean it does not exist. Believing that aliens exist without evidence is a system of belief, one that is provably false.
1.3.7.5. Pro: Humans have not discovered a fraction of the universe, and therefore the evidence isn't representative at all.
1.3.7.5.1. Pro: The question regarded the existence of aliens, not the existence of aliens in the universe observable with today´s technology.

The observed universe to date \(looking only at spectrum of stars\) is only a fraction of the cosmos as whole. And we have as of yet no way of observing planetary surfaces outside the solar system.
1.3.7.6. Pro: Humans exist at a specific point in time. Alien life could have existed in the past, or could exist in the future. The fact that humans have not discovered any evidence is irrelevant as they could just have "missed" the lifespan of an alien civilization.
1.3.7.7. Pro: Little serious research regarding the search for aliens has been undertaken, as governmental and scientific authorities [observe a de-facto taboo](http://www.ufodata.net/) on the subject and its funding.
1.3.7.7.1. Con: Researchers are seriously looking. We study the stars literally every night. Still, we can see zero signs of alien life outside of earth. There is simply no evidence for this belief system.
1.3.7.8. Pro: As of April 2014, the [Habitable Exoplanets Catalog](http://www.space.com/18790-habitable-exoplanets-catalog-photos.html) lists 21 planets that have the best chance for life beyond our solar system. These have not yet received sufficient scrutiny to come to any conclusions about the existence of alien life.
1.3.7.9. Pro: It would be the same ignorant logic as if you got a cup, filled it up with water, and then concluded that whales don't exist.
1.3.8. Pro: There has not yet been any form of contact with extraterrestrial beings.
1.3.8.1. Con: Aliens could exist, but simply be unable to contact us for various reasons.
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: Aliens may simply be invisible to humans' visual faculty or inaudible to humans' hearing, as well as to the technology that humanity has available.
1.3.8.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.2.1.
1.3.8.1.1.2. Pro: X-rays and gamma rays would be a [favorable medium](http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/24.2.2.htm) for interstellar communication as they are not easily absorbed. For this very reason, they are [very hard to detect](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/emspectrum_observatories1.html), even for today's most advanced satellites.
1.3.8.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.2.2.2.
1.3.8.1.2. Pro: Aliens and humans might simply be so alien to each other that communication is impossible, as hard as humans may try.
1.3.8.1.2.1. Pro: We may be living in a parallel existence, not able to get in touch with each other.
1.3.8.1.2.1.1. Pro: Strange behavior of quantum particles may indicate the existence of other [parallel universes](http://phys.org/news/2015-06-strange-behavior-quantum-particles-parallel.html).
1.3.8.1.2.1.1.1. Con: Even if there were parallel universes, it is unclear that life in those universes would count as alien.
1.3.8.1.2.2. Pro: We cannot communicate with most species on Earth in a meaningful way, hence it is hard to expect that we would fare better in contact with any extra-terrestrial species.
1.3.8.1.2.2.1. Pro: Not even such closely related species as humans and dolphins are able to communicate in a meaningful way.
1.3.8.1.2.2.2. Con: Communicating in a "meaningful" way is different than communicating at all, and this we have done with many species on Earth \(i.e. dogs\).
1.3.8.1.2.3. Con: Some form of communication is always possible - if only by mutually perceiving one another.
1.3.8.1.2.3.1. Con: All perception is filtered through past experience. If our experience is different enough, we may not recognize alien intelligence as an entity.
1.3.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.2.
1.3.8.1.4. Pro: Aliens might get in touch with us, yet there is the possibility that we wouldn't recognize them as such, even when they are right in front of us. After all, our conceptions of extra-terrestrial life [are](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=WRi7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=aliens+literature+civilized&source=bl&ots=W97cJ6yHuk&sig=f_GNpFILX-t975PZ9EMEjz5yHf8&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5rsnajrXNAhXDVZQKHcdkCo4Q6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&q=aliens%20literature%20civilized&f=false) limited "by the human experience and human imagination".
1.3.8.1.4.1. Pro: Martin Rees, a British Cosmologist and former President of the Royal Society, has [argued](http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/phone/news/view.jsp?req_newsidx=61328) that aliens "could be staring us in the face and we just don't recognize them".
1.3.8.1.4.1.1. Pro: The common imagination and expectation has it that aliens should be more similar to humans than to animals \(or even simpler organisms\), and that they should therefore show hallmarks of civilization.
1.3.8.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Aliens in Science Fiction literature are [usually described](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=WRi7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=aliens+literature+civilized&source=bl&ots=W97cJ6yHuk&sig=f_GNpFILX-t975PZ9EMEjz5yHf8&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5rsnajrXNAhXDVZQKHcdkCo4Q6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&q=aliens%20literature%20civilized&f=false) in a way that allows for meaningful communication with humans, may it be hostile or peaceful.
1.3.8.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Aliens are often imagined as gigantic killer insects in science fiction. This prepared humans to be less humancentric.
1.3.8.1.4.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.3.8.1.4.1.1.1.1.
1.3.8.1.4.2. Con: Life on other planets could very well resemble the creatures on Earth.
1.3.8.1.4.2.1. Pro: The [convergent](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3146196/Aliens-exist-look-like-HUMANS-Life-planets-evolved-similar-way-Earth-biologist-claims.html) evolution theory states that it is completely plausible for independently evolving species to develop identical characteristics or even to look alike. The same can be possible for aliens and humans.
1.3.8.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: Insects, birds and bats have independently developed the capacity of flight: they "[converged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution)" on this trait.
1.3.8.1.4.2.1.2. Pro: Octopuses and vertebrates developed the camera [eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution#Examples) independently. So a planet with similar conditions might educe creatures with very similar or identical eyes as beings have on Earth.
1.3.8.1.4.2.1.3. Con: The presence of similar environments is seen as the [principal cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution#Causes) for convergent evolution in beings.
1.3.8.1.4.2.2. Con: The creatures on Earth are outcomes of the environment that the planet offers them, including the specific gravity, density of the atmosphere and sources of energy available. It is very unlikely that another planet will provide the same or even a very similar set of environmental factors.
1.3.8.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.1.4.2.1.3.
1.3.8.1.4.2.3. Con: The fact that it is possible that aliens resemble creatures present on Earth does not eliminate the potential that they do not - and therefore this is no response to the idea that we have failed to recognise signs of alien life when we have encountered them.
1.3.8.1.5. Pro: One theory is that aliens' thought processes could be significantly different to humans' in terms of speed and response. It could conceivably take an alien species several hours, days, months, or even decades to relate a single phrase translatable by human beings.
1.3.8.1.6. Pro: The [Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter#Main_argument) theory claims that intelligent alien life does exist, but it is incapable of technologically advancing enough for long-distance space communication or travel for various reasons.
1.3.8.1.6.1. Pro: Physical space travel and colonisation could generally be too expensive or inefficient.
1.3.8.1.6.2. Pro: Some sort of \(global\) catastrophe could prevent intelligent life from reaching a certain level of technology.
1.3.8.1.6.3. Pro: The mother planets' resources could have been exploited and consumed before the civilizations were able to leave them.
1.3.8.1.7. Pro: The distances in space might be too vast for contact. The [furthest known galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GN-z11) is 32 billion light years away from Earth, and even the [outer edge](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/milkyway_info.html) of our galaxy is 100.000 light years away. As no message can travel faster than the speed of light, this makes communication next to impossible.
1.3.8.1.7.1. Pro: The light that could tell an observer that life exists on Earth - which happened around 15.000 years ago - has not yet reached any observer further away than 15.000 light years. It has thus made it only [15%](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/cosmic/milkyway_info.html) of the way through the Milky Way and only [0.00005%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GN-z11) of the way to the most distant galaxy we know of.
1.3.8.2. Pro: We have been listening for radio signals from other solar systems since [1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Ozma), and have never heard anything.
1.3.8.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.3.8.2.2. Con: There could well be alien civilizations that do not transmit strong enough signals to be detected.
1.3.8.2.2.1. Pro: In the sense of Star Trek's [Prime Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive), aliens might not get in touch in order to not disturb Earth's civilization and impose themselves.
1.3.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: This is a popular theme in SciFi literature. In Arthur C. Clarke's "[Childhood's End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood%27s_End)", for example, aliens have been observing humanity for a long time but only intervene when humans turn into a threat to their own welfare.
1.3.8.2.2.1.2. Pro: They may even find entertainment in watching us, and be concerned not to disrupt us and ruin that.
1.3.8.2.2.1.3. Pro: If the existence of aliens were revealed to us, this might call into question the very foundation of our political order and state system - that is: sovereignty - as those in possession of absolute power might [not be states \(and thereby humans\) anymore](http://ptx.sagepub.com/content/36/4/607.abstract) but extraterrestrial beings.
1.3.8.2.3. Con: Alien civilizations might have died long ago and any radiowaves they used might have long passed by Earth.
1.3.8.2.4. Con: The time it takes for radio signals to broadcast throughout the universe is much larger than the 50 years we have spent listening for responses.
1.3.8.2.4.1. Con: This misunderstands what we are listening for. If an alien civilisation is persistently using radiowaves to communicate, once they have started reaching us, they'll continue to do so for whatever period of time that civilisation used them.
1.3.8.2.5. Con: The [RATAN-600](http://www.vice.com/en_au/read/did-this-russian-space-telescope-just-detect-signs-of-alien-life?utm_source=vicefbanz&utm_campaign=global) telescope detected a strong radio signal from distant star HD 164595, about 95 light-years from Earth. To transmit the signal over such a long distance would require about 50 trillion watts of power. Only very advanced civilizations could provide such a huge amount of energy.
1.3.8.2.5.1. Con: SETI, which manages the project, has since confirmed that [the signal was most likely Earth-based noise](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/31/ratan-600-telescope-russia-extratrerrestrial-aliens-space).
1.3.8.2.6. Con: [Earth's \(broadcast\) signals](http://phys.org/news/2016-06-itll-years-aliens-contact.html) have reached every star within about 80 light years \(as of 2016\) from the sun – about 8,531 stars and 3,555 Earth-like planets. That is a very tiny fraction of what is out there. Furthermore, it would take the same amount of time for aliens to answer.
1.3.8.2.6.1. Pro: For perspective, here is [an image](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/02/27/article-0-11EF84AB000005DC-804_1024x615_large.jpg) of how far radio waves have reached since humankind has been broadcasting them. The point is, we haven't searched very far.
1.3.8.2.7. Con: In 1977, the Big Ear telescope at the Ohio State University detected the so far unexplained [Wow! signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal).
1.3.8.2.7.1. Con: There is a plausible explanation that the Wow! signal was [caused by two comets](https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/apr/14/alien-wow-signal-could-be-explained-after-almost-40-years).
1.3.8.2.8. Con: According to the "[Zoo hypothesis](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8361227)", aliens may be purposely preventing us from contacting them, so that they do not interrupt humans' natural development. In short, Earth might be kind of a "zoo" for aliens, to watch our growth as a species.
1.3.8.2.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.2.2.1.
1.3.8.2.8.2. Con: In order for the [Zoo Hypothesis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/spatio-temporal-constraints-on-the-zoo-hypothesis-and-the-breakdown-of-total-hegemony/06D2915B2AABA203BE0701E644C6C1C9) to be true, it would be necessary that the universe be dominated by a single highly developed civilization - such that it could force all other civilizations to stick to its rules.
1.3.8.2.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.2.2.1.2.
1.3.8.2.9. Con: In 1969, when Apollo 10 reached the dark side of the moon, where no radio contact to earth is possible, the astronauts could hear an unexplainable otherworldly celestial [music](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/apollo-10-astronauts-reported-unexplained-music-at-moon_us_56c80662e4b0928f5a6c0679) through the model's radio. This could be a sign of alien existence.
1.3.8.2.9.1. Con: The story has long been debunked. The [sound](http://www.space.com/32007-alien-moon-music-apollo-10-explained.html) does not resemble music, nor is there a lack of explanation for it: [radio noise and interference](http://www.popsci.com/what-really-happened-when-apollo-10-heard-music-in-space).
1.3.8.3. Con: Aliens might not want to contact us for a variety of reasons.
1.3.8.3.1. Pro: It might not occur to aliens that we exist, hence they might not even get the idea of contacting us - even though they might be able to - for example because their cognition has access to only a limited part of the visual spectrum of light.
1.3.8.3.1.1. Pro: Aliens might be used to wholly different sensual inputs, for example the high-energy light emitted by Quasars. The [average Quasar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar#Emission_generation) has a luminosity 14 trillion times that of [the sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_luminosity) in our solar system.
1.3.8.3.2. Pro: Aliens might just not recognize us as a species worth getting in touch with, similar to the story line of Orson Scott Card's "Ender's Game". In the book, the [so-called Formics](http://enderverse.wikia.com/wiki/Formics) are so different from humans that they do not recognize us as a sentient life form and without bother kill hundreds of millions.
1.3.8.3.2.1. Pro: Alien civilization could be millions of years ahead of mankind and look at us like we do at ants.
1.3.8.3.2.1.1. Pro: Earth is estimated to be about [4.5 billion years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth) old; the universe is estimated to be about [13.8 billion years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe) old. This difference leaves plenty of room for other species to get a head start compared to humans.
1.3.8.3.2.1.1.1. Con: [Red dwarf stars](http://www.space.com/33641-earth-life-premature-aliens-common-future.html) can live up to 10 trillion years. Compared to that, the approximate 13,8 billion years of the universe so far is a blink. As the universe is still in its childhood, the emergence of life might thus just take more time outside of Earth.
1.3.8.3.3. Pro: Any species advanced enough to discover humanity and get in touch with it might be so far advanced that we might not be worth its time. After all, humans do not interact much with comparatively simple organisms such as fungi.
1.3.8.3.3.1. Pro: Humans might be of relevance to aliens only if they become an inconvenience.
1.3.8.3.3.2. Pro: Any alien species that can travel space will probably find nothing on Earth that it actually needs or cannot acquire elsewhere, may it be space, resources or workers.
1.3.8.3.3.2.1. Con: There are over seven billion human beings on earth. They would make for a perfect cheap workforce to harvest for any species being so far ahead of humans to be able to travel through space.
1.3.8.3.3.2.1.1. Con: Robots capable of self reproduction would be far more effective.
1.3.8.3.3.2.2. Con: We cannot know if natural resources on earth are valuable to other species, even advanced ones, because we have not met any yet.
1.3.8.3.3.2.3. Con: Earth contains many, partly very rare, [minerals](https://www.geologyin.com/2016/02/super-rare-minerals-make-earth-unique.html); these make Earth fairly different from other celestial bodies. Minerals are very important for high-tech applications such as [microchips](http://energyskeptic.com/2014/high-tech-cannot-last-rare-earth-metals/) and thus might be to matter to a highly advanced civilization.
1.3.8.3.3.3. Con: We have no particular reason to believe that any such alien civilisation would be so much more advanced.
1.3.8.3.3.4. Con: Humans utilize a variety of simpler organisms as a source of food, to exploit their physical power, for companionship and various other purposes. Thus, there might be an interest in contact.
1.3.8.3.4. Pro: Aliens might refrain from contacting us as they are cautious. As the SciFi literature has it, even a vastly superior species might fall prey to unexpected problems, just as the martians in H. G. Well's "[The War of the Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds)" unexpectedly die from microbial infections to which they have no immunity.
1.3.8.3.4.1. Pro: The process of contacting other species itself might be dangerous, since it may reveal information to more advanced and possibly dangerous third parties.[\(Wikipedia: Fermi paradox - It's dangerous to communicate\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#It_is_dangerous_to_communicate)
1.3.8.3.4.2. Pro: Aliens might be outright scared - Earth or its inhabitants may seem threatening to them.
1.3.8.3.4.2.1. Pro: Similar to how Stephen Hawking [argues](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/apr/30/stephen-hawking-right-aliens) that we should stay silent and try to avoid contact with alien species, so might aliens stay quiet out of caution and fear.
1.3.8.3.4.3. Con: If intelligent life were common, by a law of averages some would be cautious, while others wouldn't be. We'd expect to hear from the second set.
1.3.8.3.5. Pro: According to the [mediocrity principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediocrity_principle), which can be interpreted as suggesting that there is nothing extraordinary about humanity in a universe that likely contains other species, there is no special reason for aliens to contact the inhabitants of Earth.
1.3.8.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.2.8.
1.3.8.3.7. Con: Aliens that have developed radio communication would likely broadcast their presence whether they want to or not.
1.3.8.3.8. Con: Any alien species curious and confident enough to explore space would probably not shy away from contacting other species it encounters.
1.3.8.3.8.1. Pro: Humankind tries its best to find and get in contact with alien civilizations, as [intelligent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence) and curious \(which seems [to be linked](http://phys.org/news/2009-09-first-ever-link-intelligence-curiosity.html) on a neuronal level\) beings, they probably would do the same.
1.3.8.3.8.1.1. Con: There is absolutely no proof that alien civilizations are comparable to humans in terms of intelligence and curiosity.
1.3.8.3.8.1.2. Con: The behaviour of a significantly more intelligent being is completely unknown and unguessable to humans. We have not enough data to extrapolate.
1.3.8.3.8.1.3. Con: Human beings evolved as curious creatures due to our particular environmental conditions, which reward curiousity and exploration. It is entirely plausible that life evolving elsewhere in the universe would encounter inverse conditions, that select against such a trait.
1.3.8.3.8.1.4. Pro: Technological progress requires a constant gain of information and knowledge. Curiosity is the key factor that provokes this process. If aliens discovered and use technology, it is very likely curiosity is an attribute of their character as well.
1.3.8.4. Con: It [has been argued](http://www.ufodata.net/faq.html#General005) that Earth-based sightings of evidence for alien species have never been scientifically, methodologically studied beyond anecdotal reports of observations.
1.3.8.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.7.
1.3.8.5. Con: We may have detected signals from extraterrestrial beings but have not been able to identify them as such.
1.3.8.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.1.2.
1.3.8.6. Con: We may have made contact with extraterrestrial beings but it has not been massively communicated with the public.
1.3.9. Con: Earth is a planet. There is ample evidence that life exists on Earth. There is evidence that other planets are similar to Earth. There is no evidence that Earth is unique.
1.3.9.1. Con: On the contrary, Earth is the only planet known to contain life. While the sample size may be small, it is by definition unique within the set.
1.3.9.1.1. Con: The number of exoplanets currently know is insignificant, not only inside our galaxy but insanely insignificant in the whole universe. It's like taking one glass of water from the ocean and saying that if there is no fish in the glass, therefore there is no fish in the ocean.
1.3.10. Con: Our current stage of evolution is only a blink of an eye in the cosmic scale. In a few thousand more years we may exist purely as information. Looking for similar "intelligent" life would be like ants living in their anthill in the middle of the rainforest wondering why they don't detect any other intelligent life.
1.3.10.1. Pro: Homo Sapiens appeared roughly [200,000 yrs ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence#Homo_sapiens_intelligence). The Universe is roughly [13.8 billion yrs old](https://www.space.com/24054-how-old-is-the-universe.html). Therefore, even the most primitive humans have existed for only 0.001% of the universe. 

When considering the possibility of extraterrestrial life, two variables must be accounted for: where and when. 

Our existence is but a blip on the cosmic timeline. Similarly, we need other civilizations to mature during the same period. Like two ships passing in the cosmic sea separated by both space and time.
1.3.11. Pro: We are at the peak of our technology, we would have found life about now.
1.3.11.1. Con: Every generation that has assumed "peak science" in the past has been vastly superseded with new discoveries, techniques and information. Example: Only in the past 20 years we have been able to infer from astronomical observations that thousands of planets are within a "Goldilocks Zone" to their star for carbon/water-based life to have evolved.
1.3.11.2. Con: We have no way of knowing if we are at the technological peak, there could well be more world changing technology's yet to be invented.
1.3.12. Pro: The galaxy is so old that other technological species living in it before us should be obvious by now \(Dyson swarms, Von Neumman probes, colonization\) yet we have no evidence of it.
1.3.12.1. Con: Earthlings could be "early bloomers", the first to appear long before the universe’s most fertile life-bearing years. Therefore, aliens might not exist yet.
1.3.12.1.1. Pro: [A recent study](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/what-if-we-havent-found-aliens-because-humans-came-first?utm_source=mbfb) found out that radiation in the cosmos has decreased. That resulted in a universe that is 20 times more liveable today than it was four billion years ago, when life first appeared on Earth.
1.3.12.1.1.1. Con: The universe is becoming "more livable" over time, and the existence of human beings used as supporting evidence in this claim, actually seems to support the opposite. To be true, the original claim only needs to demonstrate any alien life, anywhere in the universe, at any time.
1.3.12.1.2. Pro: [A team of researchers](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7ynj/what-if-we-havent-found-aliens-because-humans-came-first) have calculated that life would be about one thousand times more likely to arise in the distant future considering the probability of habitable, earthlike planets forming over trillions of years.
1.3.12.1.2.1. Con: Event A being "more likely" to happen in the future is not proof that event A has not taken place in the past. In fact, increasing likelihood is more likely to suggest the opposite. Pun intended.
1.3.12.1.3. Con: We might just as well be "late bloomers". 15 million years after the Big Bang the cosmic microwave background created [mild temperatures](http://www.space.com/24496-universe-alien-life-habitability-big-bang.html) \(compared to minus 270 degrees Celsius today\) which made large parts of the universe habitable and established good conditions for life to develop.
1.3.12.1.4. Con: The probability that humanity is the first technologically-advanced species the cosmos has created is [less than one in ten billion trillion](http://www.space.com/32793-intelligent-alien-life-probability-high.html).
1.3.12.1.4.1. Con: Communicating a value without it's uncertainty is meaningless. 
If the uncertainty is 1% say, then that value can be considered pretty accurate. If the uncertainty is very big though, that means the probability really can be anything between 0 and 1. The parent claim doesn't specify what the bounds for error are.
1.3.12.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.3.2.1.1.1.
1.3.12.2. Con: Unexplained emission fluctuations from [KIC 8462852](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIC_8462852) \(aka "Tabby's Star"\) could be caused by a [Dyson swarm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere#Dyson_swarm), which would require a technologically advanced alien civilisation.
1.3.12.2.1. Con: Experts have already [ruled out](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3306982/Dyson-sphere-megastructure-NOT-aliens-Study-rules-extraterrestrial-origin-admits-doesn-t-know-is.html) the possibility that the phenomenon is a Dyson swarm.
1.3.12.2.1.1. Con: You cannot rule out a technology you do not nearly know how to build.
1.3.12.2.1.1.1. Con: Scientists do not need to understand the technology to rule it out. The total absence of any communicating signal eliminates the possibility of satellites in a Dyson swarm, regardless of what precise technology might have been used.
1.3.12.3. Con: Evidence of extinct species on our own planet \(e.g., dinosaurs\) is buried beneath the surface. This makes it very hard to find evidence of extinct species on/in other planets/solar systems/galaxies.
1.3.13. Con: There are findings and reports of supporting evidence.
1.3.13.1. Pro: High ranking [government officials](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hellyer) have [testified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i-48LpRB9c&feature=youtu.be) that we have been visited and contacted directly by extraterrestrials.
1.3.13.2. Pro: NASA has found [an unidentified object](https://www.cnet.com/news/asteroid-a-2017-u1-earth-space-nasa-alien/) like many others before it, but this time it was too fast to be a simple asteroid and it was more colorful than other, normal asteroids - NASA astronomer Joseph Masiero says it is actually red.
1.3.13.2.1. Con: A/2017 U1 is alien in the sense that [it is not native to our solar system](https://theconversation.com/a-fleeting-visit-an-asteroid-from-another-planetary-system-just-shot-past-earth-86482), not in the sense that it gives any evidence of life outside of our solar system - it has been identified as an asteroid, just one from further afield than we normally find.
1.3.13.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.2.9.
1.3.13.4. Pro: There are persistent reports of [UFO sightings](http://www.ufosightingsdaily.com) around the world.
1.3.13.4.1. Pro: Dr. [Roger Leir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Leir) has done dozens of [surgeries](https://youtu.be/l96E5rdahX4) that have taken unknown objects out of people from alleged alien abdication.
1.3.13.4.2. Pro: Trustworthy sightings of unidentified objects have become [so common and systematic](http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/chasing-ufos/articles/five-good-reasons-to-believe-in-ufos/), it seems unlikely that these observations can be dismissed easily.
1.3.13.4.2.1. Pro: The so-called [Belgian UFO Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_UFO_wave) is based on observations and concordant statements by thousands of people as well as the pilots and radar of two F-16s of the Belgian Air Force.
1.3.13.4.2.1.1. Con: Skeptical voices explain the Belgian UFO Wave as [mass delusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_UFO_wave#Skeptical_explanations).
1.3.13.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Such delusions involve substantial media reporting causing a confirmation effect - those who would previously have dismissed a flickering light as a plane now interpret it as part of a pattern of others' sightings.
1.3.13.4.2.1.2. Con: The one photograph to have resulted from what is claimed to be upwards of 13,000 sightings was [later admitted to be a hoax](https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4538).
1.3.13.4.2.1.3. Con: The F-16s were later determined by the Belgian military to have [literally been chasing each other](https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4538).
1.3.13.4.2.1.4. Con: The original incident to have sparked the wave of sightings is described significantly differently in the police report of the two gendarmes who saw it than it was in the media - and their report is consistent with them [seeing Venus and seeing and hearing a particular type of helicopter](https://skeptoid.com/episodes/4538).
1.3.13.4.2.2. Pro: Beyond trust in UFO sightings, there are religions purporting to take direction from alien beings and voices, which are transmuted through earthbound rule-makers.  Many flourish, and [some continue to grow](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/), thousands of years of human evolution later.
1.3.13.4.2.2.1. Con: By this logic, any claim to truth could be evaluated based on the number of those who agree with it.
1.3.13.4.3. Con: The patterns visible in these sightings call into question whether one should put much trust in them.
1.3.13.4.3.1. Pro: In the United States there were [big spikes](http://metrocosm.com/map-of-ufo-sightings/) in reported UFO sightings over the past decades on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day and especially on Independence Day. It is doubtful that aliens care about these holidays - whereas humans celebrate them with loads of fireworks and alcohol.
1.3.13.4.3.2. Pro: The reports of UFO sightings in the United States during the past decades tend to [geographically concentrate](http://metrocosm.com/map-of-ufo-sightings/) on the areas around the country's largest airports. Misidentification of ordinary airplanes are thus a probable cause,
1.3.13.4.4. Con: No definitive physical evidence of alien UFOs has ever been found.
1.3.13.4.5. Con: Human senses are fallible and fool us all the time to see and perceive things that are not there \(e.g. optical illusions\).
1.3.13.4.6. Con: Human eye witnesses and their memory are [notoriously unreliable](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/), which has become a well-established cautionary note in the judicial system.
1.3.13.4.7. Pro: Even in the ancient world, eyewitnesses wrote [reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reported_UFO_sightings#By_location) about UFO sightings.
1.3.13.4.7.1. Con: There are a lot of antique "reports", including [flying beings with wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel), wars won with the [help of gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad#Divine_Intervention) or [supernatural demigods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) resurrected from the dead and appearing to previous comrades in ghost form. None of those are proven or even credible.
1.3.13.4.7.2. Pro: Even NASA reports on [unexplainable](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/703237-nasa-reports-on-credible-ufo-sightings-in-ancient-times/) UFO sightings in ancient times.
1.3.13.4.7.2.1. Con: NASA did not commission, research or publish the report - until the death of the employee who wrote it as a hobby, [in commemoration](http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/on-nasa-scientist-richard-stotherss-evaluation-of-roman-ufo-sightings).
1.3.13.4.7.2.2. Con: Stothers unquestioningly accepts ancient eyewitness accounts, arguing that such civilisations had no reason to fabricate them. Given that those civilisations also recorded significant amounts of outright mythology, and were vulnerable to the same problems with eyewitness accounts that persist today - but without the various understandings of the world that we can today use to interpret such accounts - this is terrible research practice.
1.3.13.4.7.2.2.1. Pro: Indeed, the list of wonders from Livy that he largely relies on also [reports](http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/on-nasa-scientist-richard-stotherss-evaluation-of-roman-ufo-sightings), among other things, a cow that gave birth to a lamb, a sword-shaped star and a comet that stayed visible for a year. His failure to question his sources makes his work nearly useless.
1.3.13.4.7.2.3. Con: By definition, history is replete with stories that refer to phenomena that can't be replicated. Thus, the fact that phenomena in these stories has not been explained is quite different than saying that they are "unexplainable" in a scientific sense.
1.3.13.4.7.3. Pro: Major Meso-American societies – the Aztec, Maya and Inca – are purported to have been [helped along by alien visitors](http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread560183/pg1), before the Spanish conveniently wiped out their "superior knowledge".
1.3.13.4.7.3.1. Con: This is literally just a conspiracy theory.
1.3.13.4.7.4. Con: Mental illness, and various physical and pharmacological conditions that cause hallucinations, are not an exclusively modern feature of humanity.
1.3.13.4.7.5. Con: In ancient times, human beings had a more restricted understanding of the world. Natural phenomenon that we now understand - such as the Northern Lights - could easily be misinterpreted by those unfamiliar with them, particularly when they occur very rarely in some areas.
1.3.13.4.8. Con: Just because a flying object cannot be identified \(temporarily\) does not necessarily mean this object is extraterrestrial. This assumption lacks basic logic, as the presupposition is purely speculative.
1.3.13.4.8.1. Pro: Many [UFOs](http://www.csicop.org/si/show/astronomer_looks_at_ufos_a_lot_less_than_meets_the_eye) turn out to be perfectly natural objects \(meteors, bright planets\), processes in the Earth’s atmosphere or beyond, or human crafts.
1.3.13.4.8.1.1. Pro: UFOs do not necessarily have to be crafted or piloted by aliens. An advanced military aircraft could be mistaken for an alien UFO by most people as well.
1.3.13.4.8.1.1.1. Pro: An advanced military aircraft which literally looked like what many assume an alien UFO would look like was the Nazis' "[Die Glocke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Glocke)".
1.3.13.4.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: If the Nazis could construct a vehicle that looked like what most people assume an alien UFO would almost 80 years ago, today's military forces are likely capable of creating aircrafts with unbelievable features  - which people might interpret as alien crafts.
1.3.13.4.8.1.1.1.2. Con: [Skeptics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Glocke) claim that "Die Glocke" is an object of speculation and question if it has ever existed.
1.3.13.4.8.1.1.2. Pro: The [Avrocar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Canada_VZ-9_Avrocar), developed in the 1950s, actually is a flying saucer.
1.3.13.4.8.1.1.3. Pro: Human beings have no knowledge of what an alien UFO would look like. When they see unidentified flying objects - literally, the meaning of the term "UFO" - it is their own predilections that result in them assuming "alien", as opposed to "military plane".
1.3.13.4.9. Con: Most UFO sightings are reported by [laypersons](http://www.csicop.org/si/show/astronomer_looks_at_ufos_a_lot_less_than_meets_the_eye) with no sophisticated knowledge, and not by professionals who observe the sky daily, or by the tens of thousands of active hobby astronomers.
1.3.13.4.9.1. Pro: An undocumented report is unconvincing, and should be labelled as hearsay. Those unfamiliar with celestial objects, light passing through atmosphere, and the workings of the universe have reported understood objects, such as bright planets, as UFOs.
1.3.13.4.9.2. Pro: We do not see higher reports of UFOs from people such as astronomers, astrophotographers, etc. This would lead us to believe the label of UFO is generally attached by people who are otherwise unfamiliar with natural and known objects.
1.3.13.4.9.3. Pro: The veracity of UFO sightings is commensurate with the credibly of the [media outlets](http://www.inquisitr.com/3755653/turkey-ufo-fleet-mass-sighting-sends-county-into-terror-witnesses-take-to-social-media-to-share-stories-photos-video/) in which they are reported. This is no coincidence.
1.3.13.4.10. Con: [Robert F. Allnut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_sightings_in_outer_space), NASA Assistant Administrator for Legislative Affairs in 1970 concluded in a letter, "after fifteen years of manned space voyages including space stations and landing on the Moon, spacemen have brought back not a shred of evidence - verbal, photographic, or otherwise - for the existence of extraterrestrial spacecraft, or 'UFOs'."
1.3.13.4.10.1. Con: Travels to the Moon and to our space stations \(earlier the MIR and now the ISS\) as a proof for the non-existence of alien life is, compared to the size if the universe, akin to saying "There is no life in the world outside my house, because I do not see other beings in my garden."
1.3.13.4.11. Con: Human willingness to believe in an idea or a doctrine without proof is ancient, and for a large section of earth's population, isn't going away any time soon. A belief in aliens or UFOs is simply a different way in which human frailty expresses itself - akin to the adoption of a religion.
1.3.13.4.12. Pro: There are US army radar data and what army members call "credible observers". Not mentioning recorded sightings from different perspectives by different groups, like The Phoenix lights \(Also, confirmed by AZ governor at the time: Fife Symington\) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Lights)
1.3.13.4.13. Pro: Governments operate special programs or agencies to investigate UFO sightings. This shows that government  officials consider these sightings to be significant.
1.3.13.4.13.1. Pro: Between 1947 and 1969 US authorities [conducted several studies](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html) analyzing 12.000 sightings. 701 of those cases could not be solved.
1.3.13.4.13.1.1. Con: Inability to solve can mean as little as "someone saw something that literally wasn't there, and so obviously could not be mapped to a weather balloon/plane flight/etc".
1.3.13.4.13.2. Pro: The Pentagon currently runs a secret UFO program called '[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html)', which has published a video showing navy pilots encounter an UFO.
1.3.13.4.13.2.1. Con: Compared to $600 billion annual Defense Department budgets, this UFO program receives [$22 million](http://Compared to $600 billion annual Defense Department budgets, this UFO program receives minor $22 million. This is far from being a significant amount, hence the program is not of great importance.). This is far from being a significant amount, hence the program is not of great importance.
1.3.13.4.13.2.1.1. Con: The length of time the program has been in operation, the credibility of the witnesses and both the quantity and the quality of data gathered indicates that the program has merit. The fact that the budget is a fraction of a percent of the total is to be expected given the nature of the subject. The recent spate of mainstream media coverage is interesting also. Wikipedia is accruing information on the program: [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Aviation_Threat_Identification_Program)
1.3.13.4.14. Pro: Maybe a human actually did find evidence to support that aliens really exist and the government maybe bought the evidence from the person.
1.3.13.4.15. Pro: [The Hubble Space Telescope](http://hubblesite.org/image/1826/news_release/2006-01) captured a [cigar-shaped UFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CciiA3OKfU) in its "sharpest yet" picture of the Orion Nebula.
1.3.13.4.15.1. Con: There are plenty of things in space that we can't readily identify, it doesn't make them proof of life.
1.3.13.4.15.2. Con: The Hubble Telescope's official website has not confirmed an UFO sighting in the Orion Nebula.
1.3.13.4.15.3. Pro: The image with the UFO is from the Space Telescope Science's official website, [stsci.edu](http://www.stsci.edu/institute/) \(which is the sole organization that "performed the science operations for Hubble,"\) and is available for download from the same site for any individual looking to verify the sighting for themselves \( [hubblesite.org](http://hubblesite.org/image/1826/news_release/2006-01)\) The Youtuber UFOOvni2012 first made the discovery and published a video on December 11th 2016 to his Youtube Channel \([www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CciiA3OKfU&t=2s)\)
1.3.13.5. Pro: Biological and chemical fragments and combinations which are required for life have already been found outside Earth or on extraterrestrial bodies.
1.3.13.5.1. Pro: Evidence of chemical [precursors](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5969106/7-good-reasons-why-there-might-be-life-on-other-planets) to life like nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids have been found on Titan and in the Orion Nebula.
1.3.13.5.2. Pro: Various meteors have been found on Earth containing amino acids, such as the Orgueil and [Murchison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murchison_meteorite) meteorites. This, combined with the [Urey-Miller experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment) which showed how easy it can be to create environments where relatively organic compounds are generated from inorganic matter, suggests that the conditions for the genesis of life may be quite common.
1.3.13.5.2.1. Con: Lots of examples have been found or created in a lab where amino acids -- simple organic compounds -- have been created in otherwise lifeless environments. From meteorites it appears that amino acids are quite common, at least. While it appears that abiogenesis of amino acids is simple, no abiogenetic creation of more complex compounds, such as RNA, has been discovered -- merely hypothesised. See RNA-World vs Metabolism-first arguments. \([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world); [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis); [bytesizebio.net](http://bytesizebio.net/2009/10/11/weekly-poll-replicators-first-vs-metabolism-first/)\)
1.3.13.5.2.2. Pro: Since the 1950s, researchers have found that amino acids can [spontaneously form](http://www.britannica.com/science/abiogenesis) peptides \(small proteins\) and that key intermediates in the synthesis of RNA nucleotides \(nitrogen-containing compounds linked to sugar and phosphate groups\) can form from prebiotic starting materials.
1.3.13.5.3. Pro: The so called [dragon](http://futurism.com/scientists-find-proof-alien-life-well-quite/) particle, a fragment of the cell wall of an algae cell, has been found on a weather balloon in 27km altitude. The team of scientists who discovered it assert that it is alien life, as there is no known mechanism on Earth which is capable of transporting organic material from Earth to that height.
1.3.13.5.3.1. Con: It is entirely possible that there is an unknown [mechanism](http://futurism.com/scientists-find-proof-alien-life-well-quite/) that transports these particles to this height from Earth's surface. This is the preferred explanation of experts in the field who have reviewed the work.
1.3.13.5.3.2. Con: A possibility is [planetary](http://futurism.com/scientists-find-proof-alien-life-well-quite/) contamination of the apparatus.
1.3.13.5.3.3. Con: Storm clouds regularly contain [large numbers of microbes](http://www.livescience.com/26533-loads-of-bacteria-hiding-out-in-storm-clouds.html). The mystery is only how a fragment of one got quite so high.
1.3.13.5.3.4. Con: Either alien beings transported a fragment of algae across deep space only to deposit it in the outer atmosphere of Earth, or - at least fragments of - the microbes common in storm clouds are capable of being lifted to higher heights than previously thought. The latter is significantly more likely than the former.
1.3.13.5.3.5. Con: The fragment is made from entirely Earth-type proteins, something that seems unlikely were it to be of alien origin.
1.3.13.5.4. Con: The presence of conditions that are necessary for life does not equal the presence of conditions that are sufficient for life - or the presence of life itself.
1.3.13.5.4.1. Con: Not having conditions sufficient for life as we know it does not mean there couldn't be life, we are a carbon-based life form but there's the possibility for other types of [biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_types_of_biochemistry), hypothetically sure but it's still a possibility in the vast and dynamic universe.
1.3.13.5.4.1.1. Con: Based off our understanding of chemistry, there are few viable forms of biochemistry outside of carbon and/or water based life.
1.3.13.5.4.1.1.1. Pro: Carbon is the "atom of life" because of its ability to form large molecules with chain and ring structures. C can do this because it is one of the only elements able to form bonds to 4 other atoms. This feature is inherent in its chemical structure. The only other element that can theoretically do this is silicon. However, Si does not have the same ability as C to form complex molecules because Si affinity for oxygen is so high that Si will always prefer to bind to O rather than another Si atom.
1.3.13.5.4.1.1.2. Pro: Water is necessary for life because of its ability to act as a solvent. The chemistry that produces life needs to take place in an aqueous environment, or reactions would occur too slowly to create an organism that we would think of as "life". H2O is able to dissolve more substances than any liquid known or of which we can conceive. Life requires at least 1000s of interacting molecules, and without a solvent that is as good as water to put them into solution, these interactions could not occur.
1.3.13.5.4.1.1.3. Pro: Water serves an important role in the chemical reactions of life as more than just a solvent. A huge number of life-reactions rely on acid-base chemistry or redox chemistry. The ability to pick H atoms off H2O is vital for these reactions. The polar nature of H2O is also important for a huge number of reactions. Few other solvents are both highly polar and abundant in H atoms.
1.3.13.5.4.1.1.4. Pro: Water comprises hydrogen and oxygen, which are the [1st and 3rd most abundant elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements) in the universe, respectively. From a purely statistical standpoint, water is more likely to exist than any other solvent, and therefore it has the highest probability of being the solvent used by a lifeform.
1.3.13.5.4.1.1.5. Con: While this is true about our understanding of biochemistry, it's a single data point observation. Making conclusions about biochemistry in unfathomably different environments on the basis of what we know on Earth is not warranted.
1.3.13.5.4.1.1.6. Con: Instead of thinking about our chemistry, think about our conscious functionality. What systems might be recurrent and able to store information. Ort cloud dynamics?
1.3.13.5.4.1.2. Con: Because we assume the laws of chemistry are the same everywhere in the universe \(which they appear to be\), it is difficult to support that other forms of biochemistry exist. Thermodynamic laws, as well as the nature of the elements, limits the chemical reactions that can occur, even in a vast universe. Other types of biochemistry are unlikely.
1.3.13.5.4.1.2.1. Con: You do not have to change the laws of chemistry for the parent claim to be true. It speaks of there being other elements in our current understanding of \(the laws of\) chemistry that can replace carbon in complex molecules.
1.3.13.5.4.1.2.2. Con: Identical laws of physics everywhere \(as claimed by the cosmological principle\), and hence identical basic laws of chemistry, does not preclude the existence elsewhere of biochemical processes, pathways and compounds that do not exist naturally on Earth. Earth´s biochemistry is based on the available raw material and energy. The same physics in a different environment could well yield unknown biochemistry.
1.3.13.5.4.1.3. Con: We do not know if conditions for life as we know it exist somewhere in the universe. If these conditions were possible on Earth, they likely do exist elsewhere. Therefore, we need not resort to invoking novel biochemical systems.
1.3.13.5.4.1.4. Pro: Perhaps silicon- and/or sulfur-based genomic structures are not "other" types of biochemistry, rather, they are undiscovered variants of the same biochemistry found here on Earth. Perhaps extraterrestrial conditions prohibit carbon-based organics from occurring naturally, instead favoring silicon and/or sulfur in its place.
1.3.13.5.4.2. Pro: There are satelites inside our own solar system with presence of [organic compounds](https://chem.libretexts.org/Exemplars_and_Case_Studies/Exemplars/Physics_and_Astronomy/Organic_Compounds_in_The_Solar_System) galore but no sings of life whatsoever.
1.3.14. Con: [The Copernican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle) or mediocrity principle dictates that humans \(the Earth, or the Solar system\) are not privileged observers of the universe.
1.3.14.1. Con: [The Copernican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_principle) principle has not been proven yet.
1.3.15. Con: If we exist, then we are an initialized example of existing potential alienable lifeforms. Our existence \(in itself\) demands recognition in further certainty of alien life in other universal locations. Our existence thus requires proof of uncertainty by examination of the confines of the universe. The view that we spontaneously spawned into existence, may simply be a frustrated hypothesis due to not finding other lifeforms in view of the Earth according to timeliness.
1.3.16. Con: SETI, as the best funded body for active searches for extraterrestial intelligence has based their entire program on looking at [radio and infrared signals only](https://www.seti.org/node/662). SETI research is guided by the [Drake Equation](https://www.seti.org/node/434), of which a key component is the fraction of civilizations emitting signals that our telescopes can detect. This is too narrow of a constraint, especially when considering lifeforms that may have technologies vastly superior to ours, or lifeforms that do not use radio in the first place.
1.3.17. Con: There is a lot of activity out there, but we are biased by our human beliefs to actually detect it. What looks like noise, might be hello.[waitbutwhy.com](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html)
1.3.18. Con: I have never discovered you before this topic, so you did not exist?
1.4. Pro: Taking into account the age and size of the universe, alien life exists with a high probability.
1.4.1. Con: No one's measured the "size" of our universe, there are only models of what it is, that is all. It may be that it is all an illusion.
1.4.2. Con: This argument is based on an [appeal to probability](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Appeal_to_probability), which is a logical fallacy. Just because something is probable to happen does by no means make it certain to happen.
1.4.2.1. Pro: A skewed version of this thinking, known as [Pascal's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_Wager), is also used in Christianity to hedge bets on an afterlife - something the scientific-minded community would ridicule, therefore an appeal to probability must be discounted in this case as well.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: Appeals to probability being flawed in some cases - such as in Pascal's Wager, where the probability itself is undefined - does not mean they are flawed in all cases.
1.4.2.2. Con: This claim is equally an appeal to probability in its being offered as a con to alien life probability. The probability it suggests is that lifelessness is the displayed conformity in the universe.
1.4.3. Con: Given the purported vastness of the universe, an infinite amount of possibilities exist for aliens to have found us. If an infinite amount of possibilities exist then they would have found us already if they did, in fact, exist. They haven’t found us. Therefore, they don’t exist.
1.4.4. Pro: Using the [Drake equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation), astrobiologists [calculated](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/ast.2015.1418) that there are too many planets that could support life for there to have never been alien life.
1.4.4.1. Con: The Drake equation presumes an unproven model of the Cosmos -- the Big Bang. There are other models which make the Drake equation meaningless, and hence the issue of alien life. As a highly-believed example, the Biblical creation story \(the dominant story among Jews, Christians, and Muslims\).
1.4.4.1.1. Con: Unlike religions, which are based on faith, the Big Bang theory is based on [evidence and facts](https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/learn/astro/cosmos/bigbang/bb_evid). Thus, this comparison is not appropriate.
1.4.4.2. Pro: A 2013 study based on results from the Kepler spacecraft estimated that the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in at least [100 billion](http://www.space.com/19103-milky-way-100-billion-planets.html) exoplanets.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.5.3.1.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: In the Milky Way galaxy there are about 75 billion red dwarf [stars](http://scitechdaily.com/earth-like-planets-may-have-older-and-more-evolved-life/). Six percent \(4.5 billion\) of all red dwarf stars have an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone, which is warm enough for liquid water on the planet’s surface. In addition to that, the life span of these stars is very long, so life has lots of time to develop.
1.4.4.2.2.1. Con: Young [red dwarf](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/what-if-we-havent-found-aliens-because-humans-came-first?utm_source=mbfb) stars have high flare emitting activity, which can sterilize and damage the atmospheres of surrounding planets.
1.4.4.2.2.2. Pro: Even the next star to our solar system, the red dwarf star [Proxima Centauri](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-suns-closest-neighbor-has-its-own-earth-sized-world-exoplanet-proxima-centauri?utm_source=mbfb), has an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone, which could theoretically support liquid water and life.
1.4.4.3. Con: The Drake equation was not written for scientific quantisation, but for stimulating a debate. Thus it does not "calculate" anything, just proposes that there could be a possibility that alien civilisations exist.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: Specifically, values IV and V of the equation - the fraction of life-sustaining planets that develop life, and the fraction of life-developing planets that develop to sentience - are values we have no good way to estimate. They could well be so infinitesimal that N is also tiny; we have no good reason to believe that they are not. See also: [Rare Earth hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis)
1.4.4.3.2. Con: A debate can still define a certainty that will be proven if examined. The lack of adequate examination is not proof of a lacking quality.
1.4.4.4. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.4.4.5. Con: Earth is special in its ability to [support organic life](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-life-possible-on-earth-only).
1.4.4.5.1. Con: Many of the solar systems and their celestial bodies we can study are able to support life.
1.4.4.5.1.1. Pro: Scientists recently discovered and identified 20 "[second Earths](http://www.space.com/33698-alien-planets-second-earths-kepler.html)", located within the habitable zones of their sun-like stars, so the conditions on Earth are not very special. That fact makes it probable that organic life could have started somewhere else in the universe.
1.4.4.5.1.2. Pro: If liquid water exists elsewhere, then there is an increased probability that life exists elsewhere, and as the universe is billions of light years across, one would think this is quite likely.
1.4.4.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.5.3.1.1.
1.4.4.5.1.4. Con: Just because a planet or celestial body is theoretically able to support life \(as we know it\) is by no means evidence that there is or was life on it.
1.4.4.5.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.5.3.1.
1.4.4.5.1.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.5.4.
1.4.4.5.1.5. Con: Since we can only study \(in detail\) one solar system \(one which so happens to support life\), this is not supporting evidence. Many systems have inadequate resources to support life \(as we know it\). Many systems have adequate resources to support life. Neither of these categories applies to 100% of systems.
1.4.4.5.1.6. Pro: Though our sample size is small, the presence of life in this solar system proves that life exists. Moreover, the life here is diverse, abundant, and able to survive in a vast variety of environments. Considering the vast number of star systems with planets, the fact that one star system has abundant life capable of surviving in diverse conditions suggests it is likely that other star systems will have life.
1.4.4.5.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.8.
1.4.4.5.2. Con: This paper [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1368) states there are likely around 45 Billion planets in the "habitable zone" which is the range from stars where liquid water can be found \(a building block of life\) just in the Milky Way alone. The Milky Way holds roughly 1.5 x 10^-11% of the total stars in the Universe, making the number of potentially habitable planets up to 3 x 10^23. Anyone who has taken a statistics class could tell you that there's almost a 100% chance that life of some form exists outside of Earth.
1.4.4.5.2.1. Con: In order to get the number of planets that have at some point had life on them, you need to multiply the number of habitable planets by the probability of life emerging on any given habitable planet. For all we know, that probability could be substantially less than 10^\(-23\).
1.4.4.5.2.2. Pro: And when you add a time dimension of say 15 billion years or so for the universe, you get to the conclusion that some of these life forms in the universe could be quite evolved to the point of intergalactic travel wherein they "seed" other planets \(as is the theory on Earth\) thereby speeding the evolutionary process. We, earthlings, are quite young in the grand scale of things...there could be civilizations that have been around for much longer.
1.4.4.5.3. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.2.
1.4.4.5.4. Con: -> See 1.3.4.5.3.1.1.6.
1.4.4.5.5. Con: Work in space has already proven that a set of conditions for the transport of lifeforms does not require ongoing support from Earth. \[[The ISS has microbes from its early days](https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/humanresearch/Microbial-Creatures-in-Space.html)\]
1.4.4.5.6. Pro: In the context of the wider universe, the Milky Way and Earth might be [unusually well-suited](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exoplanet-census-suggests-earth-is-special-after-all/) to support organic life, for example in terms of the [solar system's metallicity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00690v1.pdf).
1.4.4.5.6.1. Con: As human life is a product of the Earth's location and constitution, differently located and constituted planets might be able to create different forms of life. We do not have to assume that other forms of life necessarily need the condition humans need.
1.4.4.6. Pro: [Drake's Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#Estimates) shows that even the most conservative estimates allow for a number of intelligent civilisations in our galaxy alone.
1.4.5. Con: -> See 1.3.12.1.
1.4.6. Pro: Leading \(astro\)physicists and cosmologists believe life on other planets is likely.
1.4.6.1. Pro: NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan [predicts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_obhmnjSkw) that signs of alien life will be found by 2025.
1.4.6.2. Pro: [Albert Einstein](http://www.inquisitr.com/1765939/albert-einstein-believed-in-aliens-but-doubted-our-methods-to-contact-them-was-he-right/) was confident that alien life exists. “Why should the earth be the only planet supporting human life? It is not singular in any other respect.”
1.4.6.3. Pro: Charles Bolden, administrator of NASA since 2009, believes that we will someday find [other forms of life](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/03/12/area-51-and-extra-terrestrial-life-both-exist-says-head-of-nasa/) or a form of life, if not in our solar system then in some of the other solar systems.
1.4.6.4. Con: According to [William Borucki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Borucki), the principal investigator of NASA’s Kepler mission, "the evidence says [no one](http://www.ibtimes.com/do-aliens-exist-renowned-nasa-scientist-says-no-ones-out-there-2112061) is out there.”
1.4.6.5. Con: The field of study selects for those predisposed to believe in life outside of Earth, since the field is far more interesting to those who believe that.
1.4.6.6. Con: It does not matter what scientists believe, what matters is what they actually discover.
1.4.6.6.1. Con: Scientists are more educated, experienced and objective than average persons. Thus their assumptions do count.
1.4.6.7. Pro: Stephen Hawking has [said](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/36769422/#.V2AQj74rIUE) "To my mathematical brain, the numbers alone make thinking about aliens perfectly rational". “The real challenge is to work out what aliens might actually be like." Furthermore, he supported the [Breakthrough Listen](http://www.breakthroughinitiatives.org/) project, a new investment in searching for alien life.
1.4.6.8. Pro: [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson) [supports](http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1996/09/01/the-search-for-life-in-the-universe) the idea that idea of life on other planets because there are so many other planets.
1.4.6.9. Pro: Just because we have no firm evidence of alien intelligent life that is no measure of it not existing. “The universe is a pretty big place. If it's just us, seems like an awful waste of space.” ― [Carl Sagan](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/282727-the-universe-is-a-pretty-big-place-if-it-s-just).
1.4.7. Pro: If the universe is indeed infinite, then the possibility of alien civilizations is also infinite.
1.4.7.1. Pro: There is no discernible edge to the universe, only regions too distant to observe in their present form. The universe is likely infinite. An infinite universe will invariably produce infinite occurrences of life regardless of the improbability of abiogenesis. Thus, aliens exist.
1.4.7.2. Con: The question if the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe) is finite or infinite is not finally answered yet and still a subject of the scientific debate.
1.4.7.2.1. Con: No evidence exists to suggest that the universe is finite. This is a Baysian indicator that the universe is infinite assuming the prior probability of an infinite universe is at least as high as the prior probability of a finite universe. A finite universe would exhibit a discernable edge. No such edge is discernable therefore the universe can only be finite if its edge is beyond the observational limit, which is inherently less probable than a universe being finite at any scale.
1.4.7.3. Con: This is a fallacy. The universe can be infinite and not include the possibility of alien civilizations. Analogy: the set of numbers between 0 and 1 is infinite \(0, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, etc. ad infinitum\), but it does not include 2.
1.4.7.3.1. Con: This analogy is fallacious. We know life is physically possible because life on exists on earth. The probability of life occuring is therefore non-0, therefore infinite occurances of life exist if the universe is infinite.
1.4.7.3.2. Con: A better analogy would be the number 2 being present in a set of all numbers between 0 and infinity. An infinite universe means infinite combinations, permutations, and compositions of matter which in some instance will take the form of an alien.
1.4.7.3.2.1. Pro: An even better analogy would be the number being divisible by some large finite number. Just as there are \(arguably\) infinite possible arrangements of matter within a space, there are infinite arrangements of matter within that space that include a life form. Therefore life represents a non-infinitesimal fraction of the possible arrangements of matter.
1.4.7.3.2.2. Pro: Life is also a profoundly more common arrangement of matter than a typical random arrangement given that life has the propensity to replicate and spread.
1.4.7.4. Con: The universe can be infinite in the sense of being 'boundless' without being infinite in the sense of extending forever and being uncountable. A universe that loops back round to itself like a moebius strip or the surface of a globe would be boundless without having an uncountable number of planets.
1.4.8. Con: There is not a large enough data pool to assume anything about the probability of life occurring; our existence[can be written off as sample bias.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle)
1.4.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.5.1.
1.4.10. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.2.6.
1.4.11. Pro: All of our searches for intelligent ET life since any such project became possible are equivalent to putting a toe in the ocean. The scale of the universe is beyond comprehension.
1.4.11.1. Pro: "[Space is big](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Space). Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space."
1.4.12. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.5.2.
1.4.13. Con: -> See 1.3.4.5.3.
1.5. Pro: The [Panspermia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia) [theory](http://www.physics.org/article-questions.asp?id=96) claims that life has been transported to Earth on asteroids or comets and started somewhere else in the first place.
1.5.1. Con: The idea that life has come to Earth from space is improbable, compared to a simpler idea, that life was a product of early Earth conditions.
1.5.1.1. Pro: It is coherent with the existence of DNA and RNA as coding structures.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: [DNA originated from RNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6360/) which has also functions other than coding. This would imply that the main process of life \(reproduction\) hasn't been subjected to any sudden shifts \(like interstellar journey\). It's been rather a continuous, unbroken slow process of matter organising.
1.5.1.2. Pro: It is coherent with theory of evolution.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Having life come to Earth from outer space would require many additional theoretical requirements, yet it doesn't solve any gaps in our current understanding of life on Earth.
1.5.1.4. Pro: It is coherent with the modern understanding of life as an emergent property of organized matter.
1.5.2. Pro: [Essential](http://cosmology.com/EvolutionOfLifeFromOtherPlanets.html#1e) ingredients like free oxygen, phosphorus, sugar, boron, molybdenum - for creating proteins, nucleotides, DNA, RNA - were not freely accessible on the early Earth.
1.5.3. Pro: The constant thermal motion, the radiation and the general "hellish" environment on the young [Earth](http://cosmology.com/EvolutionOfLifeFromOtherPlanets.html#1e) would have destroyed naked DNA and complex organic molecules.
1.5.3.1. Con: We continue to learn more and more about [extremophiles](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/extremophile.html), which live in otherwise uninhabitable environments. This suggests that young Earth's "hellish" environment might have supported life even without life being seeded from elsewhere.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Researchers found evidence of life in the driest location on Earth, the [Atacama Desert](http://www.astrobio.net/topic/origins/extreme-life/driest-place-on-earth-hosts-life/). This discovery could have far-reaching implications for the search for life on Mars.
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Three recently discovered multicellular animals living in the muck of the deep Mediterranean seafloor \('Loricifera'\) do not [require oxygen to produce chemical energy](https://www.wired.com/2010/04/anoxic-animals/).
1.5.3.1.3. Pro: [Tardigrades](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827862-100-extreme-survival-the-toughest-beast-in-the-world/) \(also known as water bears\) can survive without water for 120 years, freezing to -272.8 °C, heating to 151 °C, the vacuum of space, pressure six times as great as that felt at the bottom of the deepest ocean and doses of X-ray and gamma radiation that are lethal to other life forms.
1.5.3.1.3.1. Con: Much higher temperatures are very common in outer space. Indeed for an organism to travel through an asteroid it means that it has survived the explosion of its own planet or a similar event and since it floats in total vacuum for millions of years.
1.5.3.1.4. Pro: Researchers discovered bacteria in [Lake Whillans](http://www.livescience.com/39525-life-found-in-antarctic-lake.html), which is buried 2,625 feet \(800m\) below the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
1.5.3.2. Con: The constant change and influx of energy would have created a chaotic system that had more opportunities to create self-replicating matter.
1.5.3.3. Con: Local variations could have introduced a distributed network of organism-friendly habitats, or reproductive islands.
1.5.4. Pro: [Microbes](http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/6877/20140503/bacteria-survive-space-travel-iss-research-shows.htm), viruses and even worms can [survive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16379525) a journey through space, the radiation and vacuum and even the impact on Earth.
1.5.4.1. Con: The author of that study attributes their survival to the [design of the locker in which they were stored](http://www.space.com/19538-columbia-shuttle-disaster-worms-survive.html). Meteorites have no such advantages.
1.5.4.1.1. Con: A cave inside an [iron meteoroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_meteorite) has similar characteristics as a metallic locker.
1.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.3.
1.5.5. Con: The trip through space would subject any microorganisms to intense amounts of [radiation](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1999Obs...119..284G/0000284.000.html) from the sun.
1.5.5.1. Con: Life on Earth evolved in a magnetic field that protects it from radiation, and is therefore susceptible to excess radiation.  Life that evolved in the presence of high radiation levels would have evolved inherent resistance to it.
1.5.5.2. Con: -> See 1.5.3.1.3.
1.5.6. Con: Researchers found that most meteorites would simply get [too hot](http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/849) and would destroy most amino acids and organic material during entry to the Earth's atmosphere.
1.5.6.1. Pro: The Earth's atmosphere heats up meteoroids to ca. [1725 degree Celsius \(2000 Kelvin\)](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/M/Meteor), due to the orbs' extremely high arrival speed.
1.5.6.2. Con: -> See 1.5.3.1.3.
1.5.6.3. Con: Life could have arrived before the atmosphere so thick as to destroy it on re-entry.
1.5.7. Con: Where exactly did life start then? And how? This theory is little more than wishful thinking. As we don't know the exact initial circumstances of the creation of life claiming it started somewhere else just pushes the need for evidence into a philosophical realm or worse a [belief system](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/how-did-life-begin.html).
1.5.7.1. Con: Evidence for the existence of life is abundant on Earth, and evidence for the existence of Earth-like planets is well documented too.
1.5.8. Con: So far Panspermia is not more likely than life arising on Earth, because of course there has been more progress in understanding how the latter happened. Therefore Panspermia cannot possibly be an argument in favor of alien lifeform.
1.5.8.1. Con: The fact that there has been more research in one theory and thus it has been developed more than its component paradigms does not prove them as wrong.
1.6. Con: According to the three Abrahamic religions, humans are the only intelligent species in the universe, and were created by God.
1.6.1. Con: The possibility yet exists that extraterrestrial sentience is biologically and teleologically identical to human sentience, which would reconcile both the existence of sentient aliens, and humans as the only intelligent species.
1.6.2. Con: Even if this is truth, it cannot stand as an argument regarding the existence of aliens in general -- only against the possibility of other "intelligent species".
1.6.3. Con: The Bible doesn't specifically say that. The Bible tells us how God created our planet and its life forms but it doesn't specifically say that he did or didn't create other life forms on other planets. In fact, when Jesus said to his disciples "I have sheep that are not of this fold", some theologians have taken that as a reference to extra-terrestrial life.
1.6.4. Pro: Other influential religions have similar conceptions.
1.6.4.1. Con: It is of absolutely no consequence what a faith-based religious system thinks of claims, as these do not base their proclamations on fact. This has no bearing on the question of actual fact whatsoever.
1.6.4.1.1. Pro: Religions are not designed to provide commentary on scientific discovery. They are there to reveal truths about human spirituality and it is a mistake to expand that conversation into the empirical conversation wherein scientific discovery occurs.
1.6.4.1.2. Pro: Religions are only fiction made up by humans. We could as well claim that aliens do exist from the film ET.
1.6.4.1.3. Pro: All those three religions fail to provide verifiable evidence in order to prove that this claim is true.
1.6.4.1.3.1. Pro: The [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative) \(Tora\) and the [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_mythology) are clearly bad advisers concerning facts about the universe. For example, the Bible claims that Earth was the first-created celestial body before all stars. This is obviously wrong. So is the Quran's statement that Earth was created in six days.
1.6.4.1.3.1.1. Con: The moon's unique orbit can be an indication that it had a unique origin, thus the earth possibly had a unique origin as well. \(paraphrased from [A New Theory for the Moon’s Origin](https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/moon/new-theory-for-moons-origin/)\)
1.6.4.2. Pro: In the original ideation of Buddhism as well, there is no room for [aliens, Gods or celestial beings](http://www.buddhanet.net/ans73.htm) in the folklore.
1.6.4.2.1. Pro: Other Eastern religions, like Taoism, eschew the ideas of aliens or numinous beings, and instead see holiness in harmony with nature.
1.6.4.3. Pro: The vast majority of religions have posed the idea that the followers of said religion are "special", or "chosen".  This is not unique to Abrahamic religions.
1.6.4.3.1. Con: In Buddhism, there is no such thing as "chosen ones". Those who follow the path are liberated. Those who don't are not.  Simple as that.
1.6.5. Con: The scriptures of these religions contain many laws and principles that have been discarded by their modern followers.
1.6.6. Con: Alien life may not be intelligent. All religions certainly admit the existence of non-intelligent non-human lifeforms on Earth - i.e. animals.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Maybe God created a lot of life forms \(intelligent or not\) in a lot of other planets.
1.6.6.1.1. Con: The abstract definition of god/God is too loose to be applied to a succinctly scientific claim.
1.6.7. Con: This is an [argument from authority.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority)
1.6.7.1. Pro: An argument from dubious authority to boot.
1.6.8. Pro: [The Bible's Genesis](https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/alien-life/) states that "Earth was formed to be inhabited and the other celestial bodies were created for signs, seasons, days, and years" only. This clearly shows that life has not been created somewhere else but on Earth exclusively.
1.6.8.1. Pro: It doesn't say "only," however being as everything was created for the purpose and benefit of mankind , and alien life wouldn't enhance our lives at all it's reasonable to assume that it alien life does not exist.
1.6.8.2. Con: This is taking for granted that what the bible says is correct. The standard civil religious person will tolerate the people who believe in non-Abrahamic religions' freedom to do so. If a Buddhist's free to believe in a system that doesn't even take Yaweh/God/Allah into consideration, surely the same tolerance would be awarded to hypothetical Alien civilisations and their personal superstitions.
1.6.8.3. Con: Being "created for signs, seasons, days, and years" does not imply "only". Things can be created for multiple purposes.
1.6.9. Con: It would be a waste of any god's infinite or near infinite talents and abilities to produce only one sentient species.
1.6.9.1. Con: Perhaps God is still young or not as skillful as we thought.
1.6.9.1.1. Con: God is omnipotent i.e all powerful/skillful.
1.6.9.2. Con: The universe may have been created for human use and resource. Assuming humans gain technology to access the universe, and the human race is sustained to that point in time, it may be possible for mankind to gain non-renewable resources, since humans are currently running out on earth.
1.6.9.3. Pro: If we are to think of God as the creator and being the creator of all life, it would make sense to assume he has expanded his life-creating power across the universe.
1.6.10. Con: The three Abrahamic religions at worst make no specific claim about whether or not humans are the only intelligent species in the universe, and at best encourage the idea by introducing the idea of non-human beings or "other worlds."
1.6.10.1. Pro: Texts of the three Abrahamic religions all include interaction with sentient beings that are not human.
1.6.10.1.1. Pro: Revelations specifically mentions beings that are not human which John communicates with. Quran Chapter 65 verse 12: "God it is who has created seven heavens, and similar number of earths..." implies life on other earths. Ezekiel in the OT sees beings with energy wheels that fly and are sentient.
1.6.10.1.2. Pro: "God" is intelligent, yet is not of the human species. This claim contradicts itself. If we consider God, angels and evils as aliens as well, a lot of people will agree aliens exist.
1.6.10.1.2.1. Pro: Technically speaking, God, angels and other supernatural beings would fit the definition of ["alien"](https://www.google.com/search?q=definition+of+alien&oq=definition+of+alien&aqs=chrome..69i57.4492j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) assuming they are ["extraterrestrial."](https://www.google.com/search?q=definition+of+alien&oq=definition+of+alien&aqs=chrome..69i57.4492j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#dobs=extraterrestrial)
1.6.10.1.2.1.1. Con: God, angels and other spiritual beings are not considered "aliens" as we normally define them. They are two different things.
1.6.10.2. Pro: Some Abrahamic religions, such as the [Baha'i Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith), do support the idea of extraterrestrial life.
1.6.10.2.1. Pro: From Bahá'í writings: "Know thou that every fixed star hath its own planets, and every planet its own creatures, whose number no man can compute." \(Bahá'u'lláh\)

“...there are other worlds than ours which are inhabited by beings capable of knowing God.” \(Shoghi Effendi\)

"It remains for science to discover one day the exact nature of these creatures.” \(Shoghi Effendi\)
1.6.10.3. Pro: This is only one approach to interpretation of the relevant religious texts. For example, some portray Jesus as [alien being](http://ufodigest.com/article/could-jesus-christ-be-one-first-alien-hybrids-son-extraterrestrial-and-earthly-woman) , [like here](http://www.uscatholic.org/blog/201212/jesus-christ-fully-divine-fully-alien-26689). Even a sixteenth-century Neapolitan monk had [an alien Jesus theory](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/alien-jesus-the-pre-modern-history-of-outer-space/279982/).
1.6.10.4. Pro: That humans are the only intelligent beings created by God is only inferred in a strict, literal interpretation of the texts, but there are many arguments for many interpretations:
Christians arguing that the [bible allows ETI's](https://www.bethinking.org/human-life/christianity-space-and-aliens); Christians arguing that the [bible is against ETI's](https://creation.com/did-god-create-life-on-other-planets).
1.6.10.5. Pro: The omission of other living beings within the Abrahamic religions should not be taken as necessarily an act of excluding their possibility of existence. The context and understanding of the early audience must be taken into account.  Not all "biblical" or Christian concepts are clearly spelled out, for instance, yet this doesn't make them untrue theologically--e.g. the Holy Trinity.
1.6.11. Con: -> See 1.6.4.1.
1.7. Pro: If we widen our perspective and take into account that "life" could very well mean a non-carbon-based or a non-water based life form, then it is very likely that aliens exist in this vast universe.
1.7.1. Con: The possibility of the existence of life forms based on silicon or other elements is even more improbable than the existence of alien carbon-based life forms, due to their [scarcity](http://periodictable.com/Properties/A/UniverseAbundance.html) in the universe.
1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.5.4.1.
1.7.3. Pro: To continue to widen our perspective, we can broaden our scope to non-rational life. It is much more possible that some alien bacteria or algae exists than a second extra-terrestrial civilization.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Based on the fact that viruses \(or virions - viruses outside of hosts\) can be found everywhere on Earth in [enormously high amounts](https://www.livescience.com/61515-astrovirology-viruses-at-large.html), the oceans alone contain an estimated 10^31 individual virions, we can conclude that the most likely alien lifeforms are viruses.
1.7.3.1.1. Pro: The [necessary technology](https://www.livescience.com/61515-astrovirology-viruses-at-large.html) for detecting virions on eg rocks is still in development. Therefore, next to no research could be done on alien viruses or virions yet.
1.7.3.1.2. Con: There is no scientific consensus if [viruses](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-viruses-alive-2004/) are "alive" or not.
1.7.3.1.2.1. Con: New evidence suggests that [viruses are life](https://www.popsci.com/new-evidence-that-viruses-are-alive#page-2), as they shared unique properties with cells and evolved as separate entities.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Simple, single-celled life exists almost everywhere on Earth, and we have a reasonable understanding of the biochemistry required for cell formation and bio-information storage. The required molecules are common in the galaxy, making the possibility of such life arising elsewhere seem likely once we've searched enough places. Complex life \(especially civilizations\) requires a more limited range of conditions, making it less likely, though not impossible.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: Ameba are living organisms that are too small for the naked eye to see, so it is likely that at least ameba live on different planets.
1.7.4. Con: This argument is an [appeal to possibility.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_probability)
1.7.5. Pro: A moon like our own might be necessary for cellular life to evolve: the oils that store the energy for metabolism in chemically active [tidal pools \(sporadically fed\)](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2012.0860?src=recsys) would form [cell like seeds](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/41954227/Autopoietic_Self-Reproduction_of_Fatty_A20160203-29142-c30kbx.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1519325729&Signature=wifLXgDPYQ2PFR%2BZxN9wuFmXt7w%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DAutopoietic_Self-Reproduction_of_Fatty_A.pdf) with every tidal wash, eventually producing a meaningful cell structure. Nucleons like the nucleus and mitochondria suggest this event has happened a few times. That said; there is no reason to assume that a non-cellular chemistry would not be the most common form of extraterrestrial life.
1.7.6. Pro: "Life" can include breathing without oxygen.
1.7.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.2.
1.8. Con: The creation of life by chance may well be such a fantastically improbable event that it has happened only once.
1.8.1. Con: This argument does not apply in an infinite universe because all possible configurations of matter occur infinitely in an infinite universe.
1.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.2.
1.8.1.2. Pro: Infinity forced aliens to exists because in every possible direction every possible reality exists.
1.8.2. Con: A recent experiment recreated early atmospheric conditions on Earth and found out that RNA molecules \(building blocks for DNA\) were present after just a few days. So odds are life exist else where. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment)
1.8.3. Pro: There are so many variables that have to be perfect for a planet to hold life. e.g. presence of water, correct temperature, correct size to hold an atmosphere, right distance from a star, right place in a galaxy.
1.8.4. Pro: Maybe we are the first planet to evolve life. Even if improbable there always has to be a first.
1.8.5. Con: If you change the force of gravity just a little we wouldn't exist, if you change the composition of gases in our atmosphere life wouldn't exist, and yet, Earth got them all perfect. What's to say it can happen again.
1.8.6. Con: Rare, very rare, and extremely rare events occur all the time in a universe the size we find ourselves in.
1.8.7. Con: This claim is unprovable and contains several implicit assumptions which are also unprovable. Life was created by chance. The creation of life by chance is "fantastically improbable." If an event is "fantastically improbable" the only possible number of occurrences of that event is one \(not two, three or four\). Due to the unfathomable size and lifespan of the Universe, an event that happens billions of times may still be "fantastically improbable."
1.8.7.1. Con: While our Universe is vast, it is not infinite, according to the [theory of general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity). Several phenomena will only happen once.
1.8.7.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.7.2.
1.8.7.2. Con: The fact that we don't know the probability of life emerging \(and therefore it could be so low that it has only happened once so far in the universe\) is just a fact about the current state of science, not a claim that needs to be proven.
1.8.8. Con: Life can thrive in extreme environments on Earth. Thus, it is highly imaginable that life can exist in extreme environments on other planets or celestial bodies.
1.8.8.1. Pro: Findings of so-called [extremophiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile) have allowed scientists to scale back their list of requirements for extraterrestrial life. Liquid water is thought to be the only thing required.
1.8.8.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.2.
1.8.8.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.3.
1.8.8.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.4.
1.8.8.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.1.
1.8.8.2. Con: The environments life encounters outside Earth are much more extreme than those on Earth, for example in terms of radiation and the absence of nutrients.
1.8.8.3. Con: Life on earth emerged in a particularly unique set of conditions - and then adapted, progressively, to various of the conditions that we now find it in. This would not be an available option on most such planets and celestial bodies - life would need to initially emerge in conditions analogous to or more extreme than those that, in every case found so far, require [unusual and complex coping mechanisms](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0ahUKEwjXoeTe6_DQAhXEOSYKHWnmDpIQFggzMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fcda%2Fcontent%2Fdocument%2Fcda_downloaddocument%2F9783319128078-c2.pdf%3FSGWID%3D0-0-45-1485440-p177061242&usg=AFQjCNGZZhhQNaBc1VmHQCqgZcB5OB85pA&cad=rja) to survive \(p2\).
1.8.8.3.1. Con: The conditions on Earth when life started were extreme from our point of view today, for example there was no oxygen in the atmosphere, similar to many other planets and celestial bodies.
1.8.8.4. Con: It is imaginable yes. But provable, no. This is an appeal to probability. Earth is the 1 source we have and so we can't create any kind of statistical model for species outside of earth. Environmental or otherwise.
1.8.8.5. Pro: There is no evidence to prove life needs one certain habitat, whilst Venus maybe uninhabitable to us it may be peak conditions for some unknown life.
1.8.8.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.13.5.4.1.
1.8.8.5.2. Con: We do know, on the other side, that there is a [narrow band of optimal conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone) \(temperature, abondance of key elements...\) in which biochemical activity is both vibrant and diverse. This decreases the probability of life creation/sustainability in many "habitats". There may be more than one potential habitat, but that number may remain very small.
1.8.9. Pro: The laws of nature are so exact that life on Earth could not exist if the laws were not exactly what they are. Which makes life on Earth fantastically improbable since the universe tends towards entropy. Life is highly ordered.
1.8.9.1. Con: While at the highest scale the universe tends toward Entropy, stars as very large fusion reactors create pockets where the necessary increased energy to create order exist. Since it is established that there is a [very large number of stars](https://www.space.com/26078-how-many-stars-are-there.html) in the universe there is a substantive chance that they have supplied the energy required for extra-terrestrial life.
1.8.9.1.1. Pro: Shall we assume spontaneous creation of stars leads to spontaneous creation of life forms because our vocabulary doesn't include the words to describe the opposite of entropy? We have a known ingredient list for life as we know it on Earth. Just because we have not perfected the order in which those ingredients are combined has not stopped life from existing. With that in mind other such recipes should also exist to create other forms of life.
1.8.9.2. Con: Entropy is defined for equilibrium systems, which a solar system is not.
1.8.9.2.1. Con: Since there is no opposite of entropy then the best alternative is "stable state", and we know this is not true because we are in constant motion just like all other portions off the universe we can observe.
1.8.9.3. Con: Biological life on Earth arose from the same physical and elemental bounds observed on other planets.
1.8.9.4. Con: Given the theory of evolution, it stands to reason that the only life we might find in a particular environment would be life that is compatible with that environment. Life may take other forms in places that are not Earth.
1.8.10. Con: “[God does not play dice with the universe](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/God_does_not_play_dice_with_the_universe)” - Albert Einstein. If  Einstein didn't want to be burdened with attempting to calculate the odds of certain things, then calculating them for or against such concepts are beyond comprehension. Since we have a problem with not interfering with others on our own planet, then what is to say by design to prevent meddling interference from other life forms we have been separated by design.
1.8.11. Con: RNA-like molecules have been synthesized in a lab using a random process which requires very little other than organic compounds, heat, and pressure.
1.8.12. Con: It seems highly improbable that the contrapositive statement "Organisms on Earth are currently and will be in the future the only source and origin biological life" is true. It is saying because we have not found evidence of other life we can assume there was a unique and special event that happened only on the Earth and nowhere else due to improbability. Therefore by modus tollens the claim to alien life existing or having existed before seems very likely to be true.
1.8.13. Con: Carbon, the key element in [Carbon-based lifeforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-based_life), is a very stable, optimally configured element, and is sufficiently abundant in the universe to make carbon-based life highly probable under approximately earth-like conditions.
1.8.14. Pro: There is no evidence of life emerging independently on Earth [more than once](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016116) \(i.e. all known life shared a common ancestor, LUCA\). This is evidence of improbability of the emergence of life.
