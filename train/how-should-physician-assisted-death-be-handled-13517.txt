Discussion Title: How Should Physician-Assisted Death be Handled?

1. How Should Physician-Assisted Death be Handled?
1.1. A doctor or physician should be obligated to comply with patients' requests and should do so without question. It should be the decision of the patient and the patient alone.
1.1.1. Con: There is the potential that the patient may require a different form of medical attention, such as a counselor, rather than immediate, unquestioned death.
1.1.2. Pro: The patient will be going out on their own terms and conditions. The doctor does not need to read the fine print, as it is solely up to the patient and no one else.
1.1.3. Con: Patients may use this loophole to evade certain things, such as a police investigation or legal request.
1.1.3.1. Con: Regulations could be made in those very specific instances. For example, those pending trial or accused of crimes could not access physician-assisted death.
1.1.4. Con: If the person in question is not in the correct frame of mind they may not be able to make a rational decision at that point. Suicide is a permanent decision and circumstances can change very rapidly.
1.1.4.1. Con: A waiting period could be mandated before the procedure is carried out; therefore, allowing the patient to change their mind.
1.1.4.2. Con: Some situations, like a degenerative disease or permanent paralysis, are not likely to change rapidly.
1.1.5. Con: This could easily be a "spur-of-the-moment" situation. The person asking for death may not really want it.
1.1.5.1. Con: There is almost nothing more important than life and death, therefore, it is unlikely that someone who wishes to die has not considered other options and  has not thought it about it for a long time.
1.1.6. Pro: The patient may decide they want to take their life, anyway, and do it in an inappropriate or unideal manner potentially unsafe to others if done without the help of a doctor.
1.1.7. Con: Physicians should not be forced to act against their convictions.
1.1.7.1. Con: In the same way that a doctor cannot deny attention to someone because of who they are \(a murderer or a rapist, for example\) they should not impose their personal convictions over the valid wish of someone to die with dignity.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Dignity and autonomy does not depend on one person's status. Patient's autonomy of choice should not constrain the autonomy of the doctor. A third party, a skilled and compassionate life-taker, not a doctor, should be addressed for the task.
1.1.7.2.1. Con: The figure of a life-taker hardly exists and it is unclear what sort of education they should need.
1.1.7.2.1.1. Con: The veterinary field has been euthanizing in caring and compassionate ways for decades so there is the groundwork of a model there.
1.1.7.3. Pro: While allowing the patient to decide their own fate and course of life \(or rather death\) seems quite liberating and true to most people's ideals, it is abhorrent to force the hand of anyone in terms of ending a life. No physician should be required to end a life and compromise their own moral code. No person's will is more important than another's. It would be more proper to request a physician assisted death from a physician who is willing.
1.2. A doctor or physician should be obligated to comply with requests made by either the patient OR their next-of-kin and should do so without question.
1.2.1. Pro: If a patient is in a situation where they are unable to respond \(such as a coma or having received some sort of brain damage\), the family would be able to make the decision for them.
1.2.2. Con: The doctors may not have any real way of knowing if assisted death is best for their patient, which could lead to guilt later on.
1.2.2.1. Con: If patients decide that assisted death is the best course of action for them, it does not matter if the doctor thinks there may be better options.
1.2.2.2. Con: Doctors are professionals that deal with life and death everyday, as such, they should handle feelings of guilt, rage or sadness or get appropriate treatment.
1.2.2.3. Con: Rights to body autonomy and by extension, the right to die, should not be superseded by the feelings of a third party.
1.2.2.4. Con: Medicine, while not exact, is a science and as such it offers the possibility to analyze what is the better treatment considering all the circumstances.
1.2.2.5. Con: This is perfectly normal for all the healthcare advice provided by doctors to their patients every day. Thus, a precedent has been established and there is no reason to make special exceptions for this particular situation.
1.2.3. Con: Next-of-kin should not be responsible for such a crucial decision; only the patient should.
1.2.3.1. Con: In some cases, patients are not in a physical or mental state to be able to make such decisions.
1.2.4. Con: If the next of kin could request the termination of a non willing member, that would be effectively murder. It would be immeasurably more moral to have at least the next of kin and person of interest in agreement on their case of physician-assisted death.
1.2.4.1. Con: I don't think the thesis is intended to suggest that next-of-kin ought to be at liberty to choose to terminate a patient who is able to dissent and does so.
1.2.5. Pro: Preventing next-of-kin from making these choices does nothing to change the situation except to make it more legally troublesome.
1.3. Physician-assisted death should never be allowed, no matter what the circumstances are.
1.3.1. Con: A human owns himself. Forcing other people to stay alive for the benefit of your personal subjective moral imperative is enslavement.
1.3.2. Con: It should be a basic human right to decide when and how you die.
1.3.2.1. Pro: We consider it cruel to allow other animals to suffer in pain when medical intervention is no longer viable.
1.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.
1.3.4. Pro: Family and friends will get to spend more time with their loved ones if they have less access to methods of taking their own life.
1.3.4.1. Con: In some cases, people may feel that they have no more friends or family around, anymore. Forcing them to live on may only prove to be a burden.
1.3.4.2. Con: The wants of family and friends should not supersede what a person wants to do with their own body.
1.3.5. Pro: In order for consent to be valuable, it must come from a person. Personhood is what makes consent valuable. Because personhood is what makes consent valuable, consenting to destroy or diminish personhood is a contradiction of values.
1.3.5.1. Con: The dignity of human individuals is to let said individuals decide how they want to live and how they do not want to live.
1.3.6. Con: Personal autonomy and bodily integrity demand that each person is able to embrace a timely and dignified death on their own terms.
1.3.6.1. Pro: [Living as long as possible](http://spcare.bmj.com/content/early/2017/03/02/bmjspcare-2016-001177) is not a priority neither for those in advanced medical care nor for the general population, according to research.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: "Dignity, avoidance of pain and suffering, and remaining independent" are generally [more important](http://spcare.bmj.com/content/early/2017/03/02/bmjspcare-2016-001177) values than just longevity at all costs.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Humans are allowed to commit suicide and take their own lives if they chose to do so. There is no reason to deny that to those who are just not physically able to do it.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: For German law, for example, suicide is a form of individual [self-determination](https://books.google.de/books?id=rmP4p-h-X0YC&pg=PA600&lpg=PA600&dq=self-determination+and+suicide+german+law&source=bl&ots=wGjtQbDexT&sig=WAa4Q0nh6c2KFau1LV2n2lqKbjQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjrx-PP9O7SAhXC8ywKHfbmA0QQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&q=self-determination%20and%20suicide%20german%20law&f=false).
1.3.7. Pro: Doctors have a [duty](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/11/doctors-arent-bound-hippocratic-oath/) to [protect](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=20909) patients and avoid [harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#%22First_do_no_harm%22).
1.3.7.1. Pro: [Medical professionals](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/09/11/most-doctors-oppose-physician-assisted-suicide-poll-finds), by large, oppose euthanasia. As those are the experts in the field their opinion should receive special attention.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: The views of medical professionals are influenced by their adherence to strict professional norms, particularly the [Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath), wherein medical professionals promise "first, do no harm." Insofar as these norms don't apply to non-medical professionals, their view doesn't speak against broader public views.
1.3.7.1.1.1. Con: The Hippocratic Oath does not make the promise "first, do no harm".
1.3.7.1.1.2. Con: Hippocratic philosophy is ambiguous on the matter of assisted-suicide. In order to interpret assisted-suicide as forbidden, one must first make a personal subjective moral judgement that the service doesn't help the patient. This is dubious, especially when the patient themselves prefer it.
1.3.7.1.1.3. Con: According to [some articles](https://gizmodo.com/doctors-aren-t-actually-bound-by-the-hippocratic-oath-1465044222), only a small percentage of hospitals and doctors in the United States swear on the Hippocratic Oath.
1.3.7.1.2. Con: As they are experts in the field of curing and treating illnesses, it is in their best interest to oppose suicide for their patients. Who will they treat if their patients choose death?
1.3.7.1.3. Con: The debate about euthanasia is a debate about ethics, not medicine. Doctors do not have access to any special knowledge of the human soul or personal rights. An appeal to the opinion of a doctor on the matter of euthanasia is an appeal to a false authority.
1.3.8. Con: There is a growing support in many countries about physician-assisted death. Laws should encompass the majority's will.
1.3.8.1. Pro: In the [US](http://www.gallup.com/poll/171704/seven-americans-back-euthanasia.aspx), support for assisted suicide has risen to 69% acceptance rate in the last few decades.
1.3.8.2. Pro: Europeans generally [support](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-euthanasia-europe-survey-idUSBRE8AT0EG20121130) euthanasia. For example, more than 70% of citizens of Spain, Germany, France and Britain are in favor.
1.3.8.3. Pro: Studies have shown that 66% of [New Zealanders](http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/health/2017/01/most-new-zealanders-support-euthanasia-study-suggests.html) support euthanasia.
1.4. After clearing a full-scale medical, background, and psychological test to determine if a patient has few other alternatives, physician-assisted death should be allowed.
1.4.1. Pro: These tests would help to eliminate any potentially unfit patients, such as depressed people who need other forms of medical attention.
1.4.1.1. Con: Depressed people ought to be at liberty to access suicide, just like everyone else.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Alternative options should be available for depression, such as prescription medication or psychological treatment before taking the ultimate, one-time decision to kill oneself.
1.4.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Through testing, more appropriate treatments could be discovered and/or prescribed to increase the wellbeing of the individual, thus eliminating the need of assisted suicide.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Not all conditions may be addressed with newly discovered treatments.
1.4.1.3. Con: Qualifying who is and is not to be considered a fit patient often sprouts half the debate in regards to this topic. Who is to decide that one with severe, chronic pains is to be allowed physician assisted suicide while someone with severe, chronic depression is to be denied?
1.4.1.3.1. Con: A fit patient for physician-assisted death would be someone who wishes to die.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: This is a classic case of "drawing the line", which governments have to do on many other topics.  Eg drawing the line between taxation and government spending, or the line between privacy and security.  While there will never be a perfect line drawn, society still has to attempt to draw it correctly.
1.4.2. Pro: Requiring tests to be done allows the patient to consider their decision and rethink the choice, if they need to do so.
1.4.2.1. Con: There are ways to force patients to wait a little while without engaging in expensive and intrusive testing. \(Perhaps require a 3-day waiting period.\)
1.4.2.2. Con: If patients are consenting adults with a sound mind, they should be able to decide without extra requirements and their choice should be respected.
1.4.2.3. Con: They are already allowed to consider their decision and rethink their choice.
1.4.3. Con: Some tests may take time to complete, which might not work well with a patient's schedule and attitude. Some people might want to just "get it over with."
1.4.3.1. Con: The patients that want to 'get it over with' are exactly the reason why such measures should be taken. Circumstances may change and tests like that ensure that somebody that doesn't need to die doesn't die.
1.4.4. Pro: Tests provide the hospital with a more solid legal trail showing that the patient really did want to die in this way.
1.4.4.1. Con: If legislation allows assisted death with no prerequisites other than the will of the patient, hospitals would not need a solid legal trail.
1.4.5. Con: As with most medical procedures, tests would likely have a monetary cost attached. Paying for these tests to determine whether they are "allowed" to die in this way seems like an unnecessary deterrent for the patient.
1.4.6. Con: To prolong someone’s suffering under the paternalist notion that they may not be sure or that they may change their minds is unethical.
1.4.6.1. Con: It may also be unethical to allow someone to die when other alternatives may have been better and since there is not coming back from death.
1.4.7. Con: Tests like this are a cumbersome and expensive procedural barrier that prevents patients from having access to something they are otherwise entitled to.
1.4.8. Con: We should EXPECT patients in this situation to fail medical/background/psychological testing. Forcing them to take the test is redundant.
1.4.8.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.
1.5. Any person who is dying, with six months or less to live, should have the option to take the final act that brings about their peaceful death.
1.5.1. Con: The arbitrary subjective choice of "six months" is arbitrary, and subjective.
1.5.2. Pro: It should be a basic human right to decide when and how you die.
1.5.2.1. Con: The right to life is [inalienable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights) and it cannot be surrendered, therefore may be incompatible with a right to die.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Collective ethics cannot be imposed on individuals. Every person has the right and the freedom to dispose of their own life.
1.6. Physician-assisted death should be handled according to the law of the country in which the person resides \(or the law of the county to which the person travels\). Different countries \(and different states within the USA\) have different laws.
1.6.1. Con: The laws of a country ought to reflect the way physician-assisted death should be handled. In other words, establishing legislation makes something legal but it doesn't make it right.
1.7. Physicians should be at liberty to euthanize any patient according to their expert discretion \(including patient and/or family consultation and industry standards as deemed appropriate by the physician.\)
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.
