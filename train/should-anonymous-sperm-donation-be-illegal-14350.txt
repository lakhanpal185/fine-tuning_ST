Discussion Title: Should Anonymous Sperm Donation Be Illegal?

1. Anonymous sperm donation should be illegal to protect the right of children to know their father
1.1. Pro: It would solve the problem that anonymity cannot be guaranteed by a sperm bank.
1.1.1. Con: The fact that sperm banks are failing in their jobs does not merit changing the law, but rather their procedures.
1.1.1.1. Con: However secure, every database can be hacked. Making it public would eliminate this threat, whatever the reason for it may be.
1.2. Con: An anonymous sperm donor is not a legal parent and had no relationship with the legal parent\(s\) of the child. There's no reason why most children would feel enough of a connection with the donor to want to know who they are.
1.2.1. Pro: Biological parentage is irrelevant; one's parents are whoever raised you.
1.2.2. Con: They should still have the option.
1.3. Con: Anonymous sperm donation is often the only way for lesbian couples to have biological children.
1.3.1. Con: Not if sperm banks include sperm of donors who can be traced back whenever a child feels it wants to know his/her biological father.
1.3.1.1. Con: The donor has a right not to be contacted by the child if they don't want to be. Revoking the right to anonymity is likely to disincentivise donation.
1.3.2. Pro: It can be hugely upsetting for lesbian couples to feel compelled to accept the presence of somebody else in their family, simply because they donated sperm.
1.3.2.1. Con: For their child it may be hugely upsetting not to be accepted when he/she does want contact with his/her donor. And he/she may also be able to find him anyway, which can be hard to accept.
1.3.3. Con: Many lesbians find their donor by themselves. In the Netherlands "[Meer dan gewenst](https://www.meerdangewenst.nl/)" organizes meetings for this. Others find their donor through websites. Donations are mostly done at home, but bringing the donor to a clinic is possible.
1.4. Con: Banning sperm donations may cause a proliferation of illegal donors whose health \(genetic history, STI status, etc.\) cannot be verified.
1.4.1. Con: Making sperm donation anonymous would not affect the legality, nor bypass the strictures in place to avoid such problems.
1.5. Con: Making anonymous sperm donation illegal reduces the amount of sperm donors, creating a sperm shortage.
1.5.1. Pro: Sperm donors might fear financial obligations later for 'their' biologicial children.
1.5.2. Con: This isn't necessarily a bad thing; reduced supplies may lead to people prioritising and taking reproduction more seriously.
1.5.3. Con: DNA databases enable donor conceived to find anonymous donors. For instance via a cousin of the donor who's in the database for fun. ID-release/known donors will on average be better prepared, more likely to have infored their relatives. This prevents problems for donors and donor conceived. Which is indirectly good for parents too. Conflicts due to broken anonymity can negatively impact donor recruitment, which is bad for future parents.

1.5.4. Pro: Sperm donors often donate their sperm to help infertile couples, not to become \(biological\) fathers themselves.
1.6. Pro: Anonymity can prevent donor-conceived kids from getting important information about their genetic heritage, and any predispositions to medical conditions.
1.6.1. Con: Most sperm banks will document their donors' health and medical histories, so this problem is negated.
1.7. Con: The right of getting children is greater than the possible frustration of not knowing your biological father.
1.7.1. Pro: A child wouldn't be born without the \(anonymous\) sperm, so cannot blame her parents for using an anonymous sperm donor.
1.7.1.1. Con: Obviously people can disagree with how they were conceived. This holds true for \(anonymous\) donor conception just as much as for rape. an affair, one-night stand, etcetera.
1.7.1.2. Pro: The Non-Identity problem: [www.journals.uchicago.edu](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/292801?journalCode=et)
1.8. Pro: The right of knowing your biological father is greater than the right for parents to get children.
1.8.1. Con: There is no evidence whatsoever of this being the case.
1.8.2. Con: There is no precedent to claim that a child has a right to know their biological father. Many children grow up without their fathers for a variety of reasons, and in many cases this is in their best interests.
1.8.3. Pro: [Dutch](https://nltimes.nl/2017/06/02/dutch-health-minister-calls-anonymous-sperm-donors-come-forward) law dictates that knowing the identity of your biological father is a right, as not knowing it greatly affects peopleâ€™s lives.
1.9. Pro: Anonymous sperm donation increases the risk of unknowingly befriending/falling in love with family.
1.9.1. Pro: This is a phenomenon known as [genetic sexual attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_sexual_attraction).
1.9.2. Con: That risk is extremely small.
