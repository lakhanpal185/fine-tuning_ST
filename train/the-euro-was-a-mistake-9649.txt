Discussion Title: The Euro Was a Mistake

1. The official currency of the European Union \(the euro\) should be abolished.
1.1. Pro: A shared interest rate harms the economies of countries that are growing faster or slower than the eurozone average.
1.1.1. Con: The presence of richer countries backing a shared currency allows poorer countries to enjoy lower interest rates that promote foreign investment.
1.1.1.1. Con: This only creates the illusion of stable business conditions. The fact that investment was lured to countries like Greece was based on a false picture generated by the strength of the euro; which in reality only reflected the strength of the core eurozone economies. Once the crash hit, this illusion became clear and investment disappeared overnight, meaning the crash hit all the harder.
1.1.2. Pro: A fast growing economy may benefit from raising interest rates to offset the threat of that economy over-heating, but this would be potentially damaging to an economy that is growing slower or even shrinking.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The principles of [countercyclical monetary policy](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/business-review/2001/q2/brq201sc.pdf?la=en) dictate that credit should be restricted \(this is usually achieved through raising interest rates\) when the economy is booming, so as to discourage the formation of bubbles, and that the opposite should be done when the economy is slumping, to encourage consumption and investment. It is impossible to implement these principles coherently when some eurozone economies are growing and some are slumping.
1.1.3. Pro: With equal interest rates across economies with different risk levels, weaker economies cannot leverage their risk premium to attract foreign direct investment.
1.1.3.1. Con: This also allows weaker countries to borrow larger amounts of money at lower interest rates than they would have been able to acquire had they not been a part of the eurozone.
1.2. Pro: A shared currency value creates economic conditions that favour richer countries \(such as Germany\) at the cost of poorer countries \(such as Greece\).
1.2.1. Pro: The common currency means that countries with weak economies cannot devalue their currencies relative to stronger economies to increase competitiveness, thus favouring the latter.
1.2.1.1. Con: Currency devaluation lowers the [buying power](https://www.ft.com/content/dc2871fe-d4f9-11e7-8c9a-d9c0a5c8d5c9) of consumers \(which is problematic in times of recession\) as well as domestic industries that need foreign inputs for production.
1.2.1.2. Con: This is also the case for any currency on regional level; even with a "local" currency in each country you will have a region that would appreciate devaluation and one that will be harmed by it. The Euro is not different in that regard from having national currencies.
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Within individual countries, redistribution and government investment can be deployed to correct for some regions being harmed by devaluation. This is not possible in the Eurozone because there is no political union.
1.2.1.3. Con: Debasing a currency in order to create competitiveness isn't a good idea. There isn't any European country that can compete with nations such as China on cost. Competing on quality is what makes European exports competitive and this is clear in countries such as Germany and Italy.
1.2.2. Con: Regardless of whether the introduction was a mistake or not - abolishing the euro now would lead to an extreme economic and banking crisis. Citizens of countries with traditionally weaker currencies \(for example Italy\) would see their savings plummet in value as they are converted from Euros into new drachma, lira etc. There would be a bank run and bank collapes. Italy, Greece, Spain etc would default on all their debts, spreading bank failures throughout Europe.
1.2.2.1. Con: Only if one assumes free movement of capital or strong unilateral debt restructuring.
1.2.3. Pro: The euro means that wages in countries such as Greece are artificially 'high'; something that has contributed to large amounts of unemployment.
1.2.3.1. Con: Greece's high unemployment is [better explained](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/ier/publications/2006/katsanevas_and__livanos_2006.pdf) by a shrinking public sector, economic mismanagement and an unrealistic expectation of returns from higher education.
1.2.3.2. Pro: In a monetary union and single market, the purchasing power of a currency is determined \(to an extent\) between all countries rather than within a country. Thus a [Greek euro is worth more in PPP terms while a German euro is worth less](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-euro-analysis/euro-may-be-too-weak-for-germany-but-too-strong-for-others-idUSKBN15I1ND), leading to wages that are more or less expensive relative to what a national currency would offer.
1.2.3.2.1. Con: The increasing purchasing power of the euro is only a problem because of Greece's [minimum wage](https://countryeconomy.com/national-minimum-wage/greece). Without it, an increase in the euro's purchasing power would be met by employees bidding down wages until an equilibrium was reached.
1.2.4. Pro: The central problem with the euro can be thought of as a zero-sum game where German savers are collecting the tokens. Historically, Germans like to save which means that it doesn’t matter what Greece wants to sell because those savers would always rather save than spend. The problem arises because the EU limits ‘deficits’ of new currency to 3% of GDP while savers tend save at a rate of 5% of GDP, & with more of those savers in one country, the system skews into a spiral that Greece can’t escape.
1.2.4.1. Con: Countries with big debts, such as Italy or Greece, were advantaged by having their debts evalueted in euro: this because euro is more stable and reliable than other currencies.
1.2.5. Con: The common currency has brought down risk premia and therefore interest rates in many participating countries. Risk premia did increase during the sovereign debt crisis in those countries that had potentially unsustainable fiscal positions, but have in the meanwhile gone back to levels well below levels observed before the common currency.
1.2.6. Pro: With the euro 'averaging' its value across the member states, it is undervalued from the perspective of high-value exporters such as Germany, meaning their exports are artificially cheaper for international buyers.
1.2.6.1. Con: Undervaluation and overvaluation on the regional level is a feature of all currencies. Stronger regions \(such as a capital city\) will always be undervalued by whatever currency is in place, while rural areas will always be overvalued.
1.2.6.1.1. Con: The difference is that when countries have their own currency there are usually political mechanisms to redistribute resources to compensate for this undervaluation and over valuation. This is not true in the Eurozone.
1.2.6.2. Con: Relative overvaluing also raises the prices of imports into peripheral nations, hurting their ability to industrialize and grow.
1.2.6.3. Con: Outside of being pegged to a second currency or good such as gold there is no objective measure of the 'value' of a currency. The euro is neither so cannot be under-valued whether Germany wants to do so or not.
1.2.6.4. Pro: Germany could not have acquired such a huge trade surplus under a less rigid exchange rate systems — the Deutschmark would have appreciated and made their exports more expensive.
1.2.7. Pro: With the euro 'averaging' its value across the member states, it is overvalued from the perspective of low-value exporters and tourist-heavy economies such as Greece, meaning that their exports and holiday experiences are artificially more dear for international buyers.
1.2.7.1. Con: -> See 1.2.6.3.
1.3. Pro: The eurozone lacks many of the features that typically define an optimal currency area and that create resilient economies.
1.3.1. Pro: Any unified monetary policy without unified fiscal policy is bound to be unstable. Unifying fiscal policy would result in the creation of one, European state.
1.3.1.1. Pro: There are two main types of economic regulation: fiscal and monetary. Independent countries use both to achieve intended effects. However, the nations of the Eurozone have different goals. As monetary policy is unified with a unified currency, they must use fiscal policy, which affects the same currency in opposite directions, satisfying no parties.
1.3.1.2. Pro: On the other hand, fiscal policy involves the ability for a government to tax and to spend. If Eurozone fiscal policy is consolidated, then only the Eurozone's overarching government would be able to spend and tax, essentially replacing independent national governments.
1.3.1.3. Con: European States \(i.e. national governments\) should not try to unify monitary and fiscal policies. Government should manage budget within the fiscal policy provided by parliament and leave monetary policy to central bank. This process has worked effectively in the United States, [which actually are separate states but with political unification and  separate fiscal policies](http://www.nber.org/papers/w5449.pdf).
1.3.1.4. Pro: The countries that join the single currency no longer benefit from the corrective effect of the balance of payments mechanism. Unlike countries having their own currencies, individual Eurozone members can run large balance of payments deficits or surpluses for several years, which may create serious imbalances in their economies.
1.3.1.5. Con: The criteria for entry into the eurozone too weak, and were fudged to allow some 'key' countries to join - notably Italy. But, now it's here it would be massively damaging to go back. The big issue is that while there is monetary union there is no fiscal union. If fiscal policy was set centrally, much in the same way as in the USA, then a lot of issues with the euro would go away.
1.3.2. Pro: Even if labour mobility is not blocked by law, the eurozone encompasses a range of countries with very distinct languages and cultures; both of which create large 'soft' barriers to seeking or accepting new jobs within the currency area.
1.3.3. Con: The presence of free trade policies within the eurozone means that there is an effective single market and thus the ability for supply/demand to balance across the currency area.
1.3.3.1. Con: "Free trade" roughly matches two \("capital-goods/labor mobility"\) of the 4 optimal currency-area criteria. The elephant missing from the room is the "risk sharing system". Keynes proved that markets cannot "irrationally" move against falling-wages/unemployment and/or shrinking money-supply. ECB is crippled by it's founding regulations on that front, as it cannot fund any failing state.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Greece borrowed directly from member-states rather than the ECB. The European Stability Mechanism managed those funds, which specifically did not allocate money to addressing unemployment.
1.3.4. Con: The common regulatory environment of the EU means that capital and finance is highly mobile can easily shift across national borders to find efficient investments.
1.3.4.1. Con: This also means that different workforces must compete with one another, leading to a desertion of the means of production in developed countries \(or where working rights are obtrusive\) to less developed countries where workers are cheaper and easier to employ. This leads developed countries with no choice but to reduce their social rights in order to keep up with the competition.
1.3.5. Con: The EU has some degree of revenue sharing within its currency area, with the largest share of its budget going towards [creating growth/jobs and reducing economic gaps between the EU's various regions](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/money/expenditure_en).
1.3.5.1. Pro: Ad hoc bailouts starting during the 2010 Euro Crisis demonstrate the EU is willing to redistribute above it's legal requirements to do so.
1.3.5.2. Con: The [levels of redistribution in the EU are relatively low](https://voxeu.org/article/redistributive-function-eu-budget) \(0.2% of GDP\); much lower than between US states.
1.3.6. Pro: The monetary union appears not to have [changed the pattern of business cycle correlations](https://voxeu.org/article/euro-hasn-t-changed-european-business-cycles) across member countries.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Since it is comparatively bigger than most other currency areas, the Eurozone is prone to asymmetric shocks that would require locally coordinated and appropriate policy responses.
1.3.6.1.1. Con: The US is of comparable size to the eurozone, yet it manages to weather asymmetric and localised shocks.
1.3.6.1.1.1. Con: In the US, if an economic shock hits one part of the country this can be at least mitigated to a large degree by redirecting significant amounts of the federal budget to that area and funding this through taxation of areas with stringer economies. The provision to do this in the eurozone is extremely limited given the lack of a political union.
1.3.6.2. Pro: In particular, for "[countries in the periphery, both levels and growth rates are very heterogeneous and the linkages between each of these countries and the rest of the euro area are relatively weak](https://voxeu.org/article/euro-hasn-t-changed-european-business-cycles)".
1.3.6.3. Con: While the monetary union may not have significantly improved business cycle ties, that could be because they were already tightly tied due to geographic proximity and other EU regulations.
1.3.7. Pro: The euro introduced the possibility of a country going bankrupt in their own currency. Yet, it introduced no measures to deal with such a situation. Therefore it is unsustainable.
1.3.8. Con: Optimal currency areas are a theoretical concept and do not exist in reality - many classical nation states don't adhere to them either.
1.3.8.1. Con: The eurozone does not need to possess all the features of an optimal currency area, but at present it has far fewer than functional currency areas of comparable size and nature. An example of this is the USA, which may lack some of the features that define an optimal currency area, but still has more than the eurozone does.
1.3.8.1.1. Pro: In the US, runs on local or regional banks are less likely because the market knows that these banks will generally be guaranteed at a federal level.
1.3.8.1.1.1. Pro: In the eurozone, even though the ECB has implemented limited bail outs of banks in some cases, the market still tends to view national governments as the overall guarantors of a country's banking system, meaning they are more threatened by the prospect of a runs on their banks in the event of economic shock.
1.3.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: The market tends to treat Greek, German, French and Irish banks all very differently. This would not be the case \(or at least not to the same degree\) if the ECB really was viewed as the guarantor of banks all across the eurozone.
1.3.8.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.1.1.1.
1.4. Pro: Without the ability to directly control monetary policy individual countries don't have the tools to help combat their economic slumps or shocks.
1.4.1. Pro: Without the ability to devalue their currency, countries are unable to boost their competitiveness by reducing the \(relative\) cost of their wages.
1.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Opposition to currency devaluation is written into the ECB's institutional make up. It's sole remit is to keep inflation at a stable level and, as opposed to most other central banks, it has no remit to tackle unemployment. This makes any devaluation of the Euro much less likely, since unemployment tends to be the main justification for currency devaluation in most situations in which it has been done. \([Stiglitz](https://books.google.ie/books/about/The_Euro_How_a_Common_Currency_Threatens.html?id=rBycCgAAQBAJ&source=kp_cover&redir_esc=y), 2016, p.96\)
1.4.1.3. Pro: Germany's control of the European Central Bank, and its general tendency to oppose any devaluation of the euro, means that eurozone monetary policy is overly conservative.
1.4.1.3.1. Pro: For [historic reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic), German economists are uniquely afraid of inflation as compared to economists from other countries. This leads to opposition to most policies that involve currency devaluation.
1.4.1.3.2. Con: The ECB's use of quantitative easing, a tool that is definitely not conservative, was opposed by Germany but launched by Mario Draghi despite this.
1.4.1.3.3. Con: Italy and other european southern countries got a [huge budget flexibility](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-budget-eu-idUSKBN19X2L2) by the EU, meaning that they were authorized to violate the Maastricht economic rules. This tool is not conservative if we consider that Germany, which is usually associated with economic conservatorism, prefers upholding Maastricht rules.
1.4.1.3.4. Pro: Even at the height of the financial crisis, Germany's manufacturing sector was extremely [productive](https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21579145-ingredients-german-economic-success-are-more-complex-they-seem-dissecting), meaning the country benefited from a strong euro. This helped to inform opposition to all but the most limited currency devaluation.
1.4.1.4. Pro: The [strategy](http://www.nber.org/feldstein/fa121311.html) of devaluing a country's currency and then defaulting has been successful for numerous Latin American countries with unsustainably large fiscal and trade deficits. If Greece stays in the EU, it is impossible to try this possible solution.
1.4.1.5. Con: Currency devaluation does not adequately address supply shocks, political demands, government corruption and so forth, all of which work in tandem during economic crisis. So devaluing the currency only pushes the problem away for a later date, making it much worse in the long run.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: Currency devaluation does not prevent states from also using all those mechanisms mentioned to create a holistic and effective policy.
1.4.2. Con: If left to its own devices, the market will naturally provide a currency devaluation in real terms without need to resort to monetary policy.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Unemployment brought about by economic shock will drive down wages, which means for investors a euro in real terms will go further in Greece than it will in Germany. This is in effect a naturally occurring devaluation and brings about an increase in competitiveness that can aid recovery from the economic shock.
1.4.3. Pro: The economic and policy leverage that other members of the eurozone exert means that they can enforce harmful 'austerity' policies on other countries that are counterproductive to their economic recovery.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Greece has had [little say](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/19/grexit-talk-lenders-demand-austerity-greece-bailout-euro) on the austerity measures imposed on it by the EU.
1.4.3.2. Con: The ECB has no incentive to purposely cause economic stagnation in the periphery, so austerity measures are likely to only be imposed when public spending is unsustainably high.
1.4.3.2.1. Con: The issue is not that the ECB actively wants to cause economic stagnation, but rather that it has such an ideological commitment to the idea that austerity is the only policy option that it is blinded to other possible solutions.
1.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: This is because the ECB has been ideologically captured by the German Bundesbank, which sees the euro as a means to enforce fiscal discipline upon other eurozone countries \([Stiglitz](https://books.google.ie/books/about/The_Euro_How_a_Common_Currency_Threatens.html?id=rBycCgAAQBAJ&source=kp_cover&redir_esc=y), 2016, p.145-174\)
1.4.3.2.1.1.1. Con: 'Ideologically' the central bank is a result of capitalistic evolution. The fiscal discipline \([Stability and Growth Pact](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stability-growth-pact.asp)\) on the other hand was a political choice \(although also neoliberal\). The Central Bank acts as enforcer of this agreement in the same way the judicial system has the authority to deploy sentences. However because of the separation of duties, the Central Bank \(or the German Bundesbank\) cannot be said to be the one who made this agreement/'law'.
1.4.3.2.2. Pro: Economic stagnation in the periphery can lead to instability that can threaten the core Eurozone countries as well. This means that even if the ECB is controlled by Germany, there will always be an incentive to avoid this unless it is absolutely necessary.
1.4.4. Pro: You can’t tie so many economies together - each with their own economic cycles, political cycles, cultures, aspirations, challenges, fiscal policies, national debt etc - without creating extreme pressure buildup over time. We have seen this recently with the likes of Spain and Portugal, and noticeably with Greece whose economic is at breaking point. Here we see the strength of the euro render their tourism sector uncompetitive, businesses fail, and the government unable to balance the economy.
1.4.5. Con: The common currency stops individual countries from devaluing their own currencies to spur exports. One country devaluing its currency can lead to other countries devaluing which can create a viscous circle in which all countries lose and citizens savings disappear.
1.4.6. Pro: In addition to individual countries not having the ability to control monetary policy, even the EU Central Bank does not have a mandate to enforce effective monetary policy \(watching price stability is it's only task\). The euro completely lacks the most effective tool to combat depression and disintegration both on small and large scale.
1.4.7. Con: Many countries cannot be trusted to use monetary policy responsibly. It is better that they be forced to suffer through market discipline and adjustment, when devaluation often just risks even greater economic ruin at a later date.
1.4.7.1. Pro: Prior to the crisis, Greece [benefitted from very low bond yields the enabled it to take on copious amounts of debt](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/1/8871509/greece-charts). Those yields were only so low because investors falsely assumed that Greek debt was fully secured by the rest of the eurozone.
1.4.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.4.8. Con: Collective responses to these slumps can often still be found. For example, up until recently the ECB practiced a large scale policy of [quantitative easing](https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ecb-ready-to-signal-shift-in-quantitative-easing-policy-36480440.html) to help ease the effects of recent economic shocks.
1.4.8.1. Con: The main reason that devaluation is a useful policy response to economic shock is that it increases competitiveness and makes exports cheaper relative to other countries. The ECB's quantitative easing will never be as effective as devaluation in specific countries because it is applied across the eurozone generally.
1.4.8.2. Con: This did not go nearly far enough as the fundamental problem remains that the scale of devaluation that countries like Greece or Portugal have needed will always be counter to the interest of stronger economies like Germany.
1.4.8.2.1. Pro: If a country is hit hard economically, like the periphery of the eurozone was after the financial crash, a large devaluation can be a very useful response as it can increase competitiveness and make the value of exports cheaper. The problem was, and still is, that this scale of devaluation will never be in the interest of stronger economies. Since they have no need to boost competitiveness, the effect would just be lowering wages for no real reason.
1.4.9. Pro: This is borne out by the fact that the eventual recovery of the eurozone from the 2008 financial crash was anemic as compared to that of comparable countries that do control their own monetary policy, such as the US and the UK.
1.4.9.1. Con: This is not a problem if the BCE functions well; after a first period of chaos, Mario Draghi, president of the BCE, has begun to apply QE, which is still helping european nations.
1.4.9.2. Pro: The recovery of the US from the 2008 crisis was much [stronger and quicker](http://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2013/bulletin90_pw_article2-7418.pdf) than that of the Eurozone.
1.5. Con: The EU's goal of ever-further integration is key to the future of Europe and the eurozone is a key part of that project.
1.5.1. Pro: Today's perspective on the euro is a snapshot in the middle of a project for a generation. It may feel like a mistake today \(March '18\), but we don't know how it is going to turn out in the long term.
1.5.1.1. Pro: The euro was bound to have teething problems, and most of the issues that exist currently can be fixed.
1.5.1.1.1. Pro: The fact that the ECB was willing to utilise [quantitative easing](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/26/ecb-to-halve-bond-buying-as-it-plans-to-scale-back-quantitative-easing) shows that it is more flexible than commonly thought and suggests that it can take action that benefits the eurozone as a whole and not just the core countries.
1.5.1.2. Pro: Economies may differ but this has to be worked out towards a general unification. Cultural, language and social differences must also be bridged and combined. This combination and fermentation of diversity is the major advantage of unification and this combination should be promoted and built upon. It should note be the excuse for fragmentation and isolation.
1.5.2. Pro: The shared euro makes armed conflict between member states almost non-existent. What ever the economic downside of a shared currency, it is more than outweighed by the benefits of not being at war.
1.5.2.1. Con: It is not clear that the euro specifically is responsible for that. Thanks to things like the single market and the customs union, the EU was already heavily economically integrated before the euro was introduced, and it is this more than anything that has prevented war between EU member states.
1.5.3. Con: There is no need for integration to go ever-further. 
It is a policy choice, every level of integration has its advantages and disadvantages.
1.5.4. Con: Every policy area can have its own level of integration. A common currency is not necessarily a key part for integration of other areas \(food-safety, environment, defense, human rights, culture, etc.\)
1.5.5. Pro: The euro is the first step toward a universal currency,  something which is inevitable in tearing down national economic boundaries in a globalized world.
1.5.6. Con: There is a fundamental flaw in the reasoning for the euro. The euro is not the same value in every country: in some countries you can live with far fewer euro's than in others. The euro only increased the level of work migration in Europe because of this. Instead of bringing people together its dividing them on this topic \(unchecked and one way economic migration leaves a lot of Europeans angry\). The euro would have been a good idea if it was only with countries of the same economic standing.
1.5.7. Pro: Nobody knows how a coordinated Eurozone breakup would work, but it's likely to be difficult, costly, and dangerous.
1.5.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.2.
1.5.8. Con: To ensure continued integration, the eurozone was designed without the possibility of leaving it. This violates national sovereignty.
1.5.9. Pro: Currencies are an important part of national identities and the euro was crucial in establishing a collective European identity, stabilising the EU in the long run.
1.5.9.1. Pro: The Euro made the European Union [real and tangible](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1350176032000101235) by entering people's everyday lives and providing a direct link to Brussels.
1.5.9.2. Con: The Euro was accepted more readily in places where people already identified less strongly with their home country, while countries with a stronger sense of national identity, like the UK, refused to sign onto it \([Risse 2003, p. 487](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1350176032000101235)\).
1.5.9.3. Pro: Generally, the symbolism of coins and bills is an important way in which policy makers visualise the political community they imagine and the pass it onto the citizenry \([Kaelberer 2004, p. 164](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-international-studies/article/euro-and-european-identity-symbols-power-and-the-politics-of-european-monetary-union/7E25B2912FC3648A50B2FA47381ED165)\).
1.5.9.4. Pro: Nationalism has lead to unspeakable harm in the 20th century all over Europe and beyond its borders. The European Union with its common currency, programs for students and science, legislation and parlaiment and open borders is a way to overcome this and prevent it from happening again: It integrates different cultures and nationalities, emphasizes and promotes common values and embraces equal rights rather than foster animosity between members.
1.5.10. Pro: By creating economic interdependence, members of the EU are more willing to cooperate on other issues.
1.5.10.1. Pro: The economic interdependence created by the euro has facilitated more cooperation and has made political integration more likely further down the line.
1.5.10.2. Con: The euro has been a flash point that has created tension between lots of EU countries. If anything, it has reduced trust and made cooperation on other issues less likely.
1.5.10.2.1. Pro: The effects of the financial crisis on the eurozone created huge amounts of distrust and suspicion between [Greece and Germany](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/world/europe/greek-debt-crisis-pits-greeks-against-germans.html).
1.5.10.2.2. Pro: The euro has become a central site of [Franco-German](http://www.eurocontinent.eu/2017/07/the-new-franco-german-geopolitical-rivalry-and-eu-crisis/) disagreement and rivalry.
1.6. Pro: The eurozone is fundamentally undemocratic.
1.6.1. Pro: Even the euro's origins are deeply undemocratic.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Most Europeans were [never asked](https://www.economist.com/node/21555927) whether they wanted the Euro.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: Most Europeans are never asked whether they want most of their country's laws and policies implemented. Rather, they delegate that power to their democratically elected representatives. In this case, those representatives did decide that they wanted to join the euro.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Then German chancellor [Helmut Kohl](https://euobserver.com/political/119735) knew that the Euro did not have popular support when it was introduced. He pushed for it because he thought it was right, not because it was backed by the sovereign, the people.
1.6.1.2.1. Con: Representative democracy, rather than direct democracy, is the predominant form of democratic rule. Under such a system politicians are given the \(temporary\) authority to do what they believe is right rather than what is vox populi of the moment.
1.6.2. Pro: As opposed to the previous European national currencies, the Euro does not have a democratically elected finance minister.
1.6.2.1. Con: This is dis-analogous because in most other democratic states with their own currency monetary policy is dictated by unelected central bankers, with democratically elected finance ministers in charge of fiscal policy. Eurozone finance ministers still maintain control of their own countries' fiscal policies.
1.6.3. Con: The European Central Bank \(ECB\) decides policy in a democratic fashion.
1.6.3.1. Pro: The ECB is answerable to its council, [made up of 6 board members and 19 national bank governors of the EU zone](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/govc/html/index.en.html). To claim that money matters is undemocratic is false. All EU bank governors of the Eurozone meet twice a month with the board to discuss monetary policy. All can discuss and agree or disagree on policy matters.
1.6.4. Con: The board of European Central Bank \(ECB\) are elected in a democratic fashion.
1.6.4.1. Pro: To claim the ECB is undemocratic is false. The board is appointed "from among persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters by common accord of the governments of the Member States at the level of Heads of State or Government, on a recommendation from the Council, after it has consulted the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB" as per [article 11.2 of the ESCB Statute](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecbinstitutionalprovisions2011en.pdf?612d466bf1b497f70394f8939932c107).
1.6.4.2. Con: Members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank are nominated by agreement between the Heads of Government of the Eurozone countries for a non-renewable eight-year term \(members nominated in 1998 for the original board had their terms staged so that one would be replaced each year\). This a political agreement that is not necessarily democratic.
1.6.5. Con: Most currencies are controlled by appointed, unelected central bankers. The ECB is no less democratic than these central banks.
1.6.5.1. Pro: Allowing interest rates to be dictated by the usual democratic pressures would lead to inconsistent and disastrous monetary policy.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: Political pressure tends to be election-focused and thus incentivised to address short-term issues. Without the ability to value long-term planning there is little to incentivise central banks to run counter-cyclical monetary policy.
1.6.6. Pro: The fundamental distance from the power-structure of the ECB to eurozone citizens it is supposed to represent is so vast that it may not properly serve the interests of the majority, much less of the minority.
1.6.6.1. Pro: The institutions of the EU such as the ECB add a third, or even fourth level of government above the existing local, state/regional, and national levels.
1.6.6.2. Con: The fundamental distance should not be the problem as monetary policy is supposed to be for the benefit of society as a whole. The ECB is not supposed to represent european citizens but has one fundamental goal: to maintain price stability \(attained by economic growth and stable employment rates\). This is \(supposed to be\) uninfluenced by any political policy \(and thus democratic 'elections'\) as there was a consensus that 'price stability is beneficial for society'.
1.6.7. Con: Almost 99% of current 'democratic' institutions are fundamentally undemocratic if you go back to the basic definition of the term. In most of today's '[democracies](https://www.moadoph.gov.au/democracy/defining-democracy/)' we cannot directly vote for laws/policies but merely 'appoint' someone who 'votes' for \(ie represents\) us. In ancient Greece however, all citizens \(very narrow definition\) would vote on all policies. Nevertheless, 'undemocratic' does not necessarily imply it's bad for society as a whole \(in a societal cost-benefit analysis\).
1.6.8. Pro: Most Eurozone countries have an extremely limited ability to influence policy concerning the euro.
1.6.8.1. Con: The main decision making body of the ECB is the [Governing Council](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/govc/html/index.en.html), which consists of the the governors of the central banks of all 19 Eurozone countries, as well as the executive board of the ECB. This means each country has equal ability to influence ECB policy.
1.6.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.3.2.1.1.
1.6.9. Pro: Eurozone countries have little say in how to handle their own debt crises. They are given the choice between bank friendly bailouts and austerity measures or nothing at all.
1.6.9.1. Pro: The Greek debt crisis was primarily handled by the so-called "[troika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_troika)", which consisted of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary fund - none of which are democratically elected.
1.6.9.1.1. Con: Each of the members of the executive boards of the troika institutions are appointed by the elected representatives of the member nations, meaning that they are ultimately elected by a democratically accountable process. In this way they are no less democratically representative than other officials within the EU or even national officials such as supreme court justices, police commissioners, or attorney generals \(depending on the country\).
1.6.9.1.1.1. Con: The majority of these officials were not appointed by the Greek government, which is the only government elected to represent the Greek people who were the ones affected by their debt crisis.
1.6.9.1.1.1.1. Con: Since a debt crisis in one Euro country has ability to affect all other Euro countries, such a crisis should be handled by institutions representing the entire Eurozone.
1.6.9.2. Pro: Countries with control of their own currencies can choose other options in this situation, such as Argentina did when it [defaulted on its debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_debt_restructuring) in 2001.
1.6.9.3. Con: They are faced with these options as a result of their primary decision to join the union in the first place \(while knowing the requirements and details of the system\). Complaining about the 'options' afterwards is proof of the failure of short-term thinking by many politicians, not proof of the Central Bank being evil.
1.6.9.4. Pro: Greece, after voting no to austerity and bailouts, requested other options for debt refinancing or literally any other form of deal. The Troika and other Eurozone finance officials said their could be no new deals unless they accepted the austerity measures, [essentially backing Greece into a corner](http://inthesetimes.com/article/18166/the-greek-crisis-shows-the-fundamentally-undemocratic-nature-of-the-eurozon).
1.7. Con: The euro makes travel within the eurozone much more efficient and appealing.
1.7.1. Pro: Not having to worry about exchange fees or overseas withdraw fees means that tourists have more money to spend when they travel.
1.7.2. Pro: By facilitating international trade, the euro made it more likely people will encounter familiar businesses abroad.
1.7.3. Pro: The euro is just a collective noun for a whole bunch of currencies that were already locked together, like the DM and the Guilder, or the Belgian Frank and the Luxemburgish Frank. It has therefore been in existence a lot longer than 2000, just not in name and has proven its worth. Helmut Kohl said that if he left Germany with 1DM in his pocket and went to each euro country in turn, he'd come back with 15 pfennigs just having changed money at each border.
1.7.4. Con: All travel benefits provided by the euro were contingent on the Schengen agreement, which is therefore a much more significant factor in increasing the ease of travel within Europe.
1.7.4.1. Con: The shared and consistent value of the euro means that it is easier to compare prices and buyers can be more confident in the prices they see abroad.
1.7.4.2. Pro: The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker [said](https://www.politico.eu/article/juncker-not-going-to-give-up-on-schengen-borders-migration/), “Less Schengen means less employment, less economic growth. Without Schengen, without the free movement of workers, without freedom of European citizens to travel, the euro makes no sense.”
1.7.4.3. Pro: The Schengen Agreement was critical in integrating EU states. Without such integration the Euro would not have been nearly as successful.
1.7.4.3.1. Pro: 1.3 billion internal border crossings are made through the Schengen Area [every](https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21690065-permanent-reintroduction-border-controls-would-harm-trade-europe-putting-up-barriers) year.
1.7.4.3.2. Pro: [Visas](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21684791-governments-are-deterring-business-travellers-and-tourists-cumbersome-visa-requirements) have traditionally served as one of the biggest barriers to travel. The Schengen Agreement eliminates the requirement for them.
1.7.4.4. Con: This isn't necessarily true. Ireland is not in the Schengen zone and travel within the Eurozone is still very easy for its citizens.
1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.
1.8. Con: The Economic and Monetary Union offers a more effective form of economic planning and regulation than any individual member state could achieve on their own.
1.8.1. Con: This assumes that there is always an objectively correct way to pursue economic planning and regulation. The reality is that the policy choices the ECB faces are inherently political questions, with no objectively correct solutions.
1.8.1.1. Pro: There is no [Pareto-optimal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pareto-efficiency.asp) monetary policy for the euro zone as a whole. Different monetary policies have different winners and losers, which means the policies that it pursues is a question of which actors have the most influence rather than what is the most effective planning.
1.8.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.8.2. Con: The economic and monetary union existed in earlier stages without the euro \(and still does in the case of Denmark\). This implies that many of its advantages can be kept without having to also take on some of the single currency's disadvantages.
1.8.3. Pro: The euro should be maintained so countries within the euro zone are not tempted to compete by manipulating their currency. Currency is a utility. It should not be used to artificially improve a nations economic competitiveness.
1.8.3.1. Pro: There is a potential collective action problem whereby countries keep manipulating their currencies in order to compete with one another thereby facilitating a race to the bottom in terms of currency value. The centralised control of monetary policy that the euro provides prevents this.
1.8.3.2. Con: The economic and monetary union which pre-existed the euro prevented this kind of artificial manipulation, whilst still allowing devaluations to occur naturally when specific countries have recessions. The euro precludes this.
1.8.4. Con: Thanks to the article 63, 120 and 121 of the [TFEU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A12012E%2FTXT), every workforce is put under strict competition since industries can relocalize their means of production in cheaper countries to sell them to developed ones free of charges. Hence the necessity to regain sovereignty over you monetary value in order to devalue it so that having your means of productions stays competitive even without delocalisation.
1.8.5. Pro: The Fiscal Stability Treaty makes it easier for eurozone countries to opt-in to sensible constraints to government spending because it collectively binds all member states. Without such a bind, future national governments could always renege on promises of fiscal responsibility.
1.8.5.1. Con: Currently there is no enforcement mechanism for the fiscal compact, and it has not been integrated into [EU Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Fiscal_Compact#Incorporation_into_EU_law). This means that it is realistically powerless to prevent states from just not complying with its provisions.
1.8.5.2. Pro: The eurozone has strict budgetary limits that mean annual deficits [cannot exceed 3% of GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_and_Growth_Pact).
1.8.5.2.1. Con: As of November 2017 only [6 of 18 Eurozone states](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2014/497746/IPOL-ECON_NT\(2014\)497746_EN.pdf) are compliant with this rule.
1.8.5.3. Pro: The eurozone has strict budgetary limits that mean [debt-to-GDP ratios cannot exceed 60%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_and_Growth_Pact).
1.8.5.3.1. Con: Even though these budgetary limits exist, many members of the union were not in compliance at the start. This contradication is the source of all problems at the moment. Also the existence of the [stability and growth pact](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stability-growth-pact.asp) should be the main topic of the argument as most people don't seem to see the difference between the central bank and the 'laws' under which it operates.
1.8.5.3.2. Con: The Eurozone's debt to GDP ratio [exceeds](https://www.debtclocks.eu/public-debt-and-budget-deficits-comparison-of-the-eu-member-states.html) 89%.
1.8.5.3.3. Con: Even fiscally conservative Germany's GDP to debt ratio [exceeds](https://www.debtclocks.eu/public-debt-and-budget-deficits-comparison-of-the-eu-member-states.html) 65%.
1.8.5.3.4. Con: There has not been a year since the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact [without at least one country](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-budgets/six-euro-zone-states-risk-eu-budget-rule-breach-in-2018-idUSKBN1DM19G) violating these rules.
1.8.6. Pro: The European Central Bank is not only independent from a national government, but independent from any particular country within the eurozone. This means it can make plans that are in the best interests of the entire region.
1.8.6.1. Pro: The ECB is independent. This guarantees stability, which has made the euro a success, but it also controversial because its monetary policy cannot be used as a tool in politics. "[Neither the ECB nor the national central banks \(NCBs\), nor any member of their decision-making bodies, are allowed to seek or take instructions from EU institutions or bodies, from any government of an EU Member State or from any other body](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/independence/html/index.en.html)."
1.8.6.2. Con: The ECB is de facto dependent on Germany, even if it is de jure independent.
1.8.6.2.1. Pro: The ECB's stance on inflation, that the focus should always be on keeping it as low as possibly whilst essentially ignoring unemployment, tends to reflect that of Germany rather than any other Eurozone country.
1.8.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.8.6.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.3.1.
1.8.6.2.2. Pro: As the nation with [the largest private lending market](https://www.ebf.eu/about-us/germany/) within the Eurozone, Germany can influence the votes of other members.
1.8.6.2.3. Pro: Germany provides the largest amount of capital to the ECB.
1.8.7. Con: -> See 1.4.1.3.
1.9. Con: Having a single currency makes almost all aspects of international trade and finance easier to operate.
1.9.1. Pro: A single currency eliminates currency risk.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Transactions which occur in two or more currencies are complicated by a risk that any of the currencies involved may change in value.
1.9.1.2. Pro: Since EU businesses primarily operate using the Euro, day-to-day fluctuations in the euro's value are less of a concern.
1.9.1.3. Pro: The elimination of currency risk has resulted in an increase in [lending](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/363991467292250353/pdf/WPS7738.pdf) between eurozone countries.
1.9.2. Pro: The euro lowers the trade barriers between countries leading to an easier purchase and/or sale of national products. Goods and services trade between eurozone countries have increased a lot since the introduction of the euro. Overall, the consumer is benefited by greater product choice and lower prices due to the elimination of exchange rate fluctuations.
1.9.3. Con: Europe must share an ideological and felt union rather then existing just for financial convenience. This because a currency's store of value is based upon trust on government, and this cannot be achieved with practical justifications only.
1.9.4. Pro: It creates a significant reduction in transaction costs because no other currencies are needed when conducting business or traveling within the Eurozone. So businesses from poorer countries can afford to increase their transactions abroad and withdraw more liquid assets.
1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.1.
1.10. Pro: Sharing the euro creates a moral hazard where countries can spend unwisely knowing that other countries will be forced to bail them out of any problems.
1.10.1. Con: Even if these countries are eventually bailed out, the effect of the recession brought on by this risk taking has been ruinous and will surely act as a disincentive to this kind of behaviour in the future.
1.10.1.1. Con: Governments are often notoriously short-termist. Even if they know that in the long term borrowing at such a rate would lead history to repeat itself, they would still be likely to do it for short term benefits.
1.10.1.2. Con: Whilst this may be true, if the euro didn't exist countries would never have had to learn this lesson in the first place. The devastation caused by the Eurozone crisis is more than enough for us to consider the euro a mistake.
1.10.2. Con: 'Countries' can never spend unwisely since the introduction of an independent 'Central Bank'-system. As this independence inhibits politicians to 'make more money' whenever they feel is necessary \(as in Venezuela, Turkey, Zimbabwe\). The existence of a central banking system already is a barrier against this moral hazard, no matter if the central bank emits euros, franks, lire or marks.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.8.5.2.
1.10.4. Con: -> See 1.8.5.3.
1.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.7.1.
1.11. Con: A single currency spread over multiple countries is more likely to be stable than individual national currencies. This reduces economic risk and creates more stable business conditions.
1.11.1. Pro: The euro constitutes a second reserve currency for the world. It is the only currency that can challenge the hegemony of the US dollar as world currency — the yen, British pound and Swiss franc are much too small. Having a world reserve currency, that it can print itself, provides independence and prosperity to Europe and provides more economic geopolitical balance in the world.
1.11.2. Pro: Manufacturing in particular is highly affected by currency volatility as it often requires large amounts of capital investment. Such as large, and fixed, investment is difficult to justify in the face of an uncertain business environment.
1.11.3. Pro: Before the euro inflation was high in many countries. Workers were deceived by the perception of nominal wage increases that did not correspond to real increases.
1.11.3.1. Con: Wage increases caused by inflation and devaluation would initially have been nominal rather than real, but inflation also increases competitiveness by making exports cheaper relative to other countries. This gradually brings about real rather than nominal gains to the economy.
1.11.4. Pro: [History](https://www.fxcm.com/insights/the-history-of-currency/) shows that it is a better to have only one currency instead of many different currencies. For example the global currency market fluctuations that occurred before the creation of the Euro could come back sending Europe in more chaos than it is now.
1.11.5. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.11.6. Pro: Having a currency cover such as large portion of the global economy makes it attractive as a reserve currency for other countries; something that gives the euro greater stability.
1.11.7. Pro: By having so many countries share the same currency, its value is more resilient to country-specific economic shocks because their affects can be absorbed across the entire euro area.
1.11.7.1. Con: A currency's value remaining high and being resilient to country-specific economic shocks is not an inherent good. A drop in the value of a currency can be an important market adjustment in response to a crash, and preventing this from happening can distort economic conditions even more.
1.11.8. Con: The eurozone ties countries with vastly different fiscal and monetary policy together.
