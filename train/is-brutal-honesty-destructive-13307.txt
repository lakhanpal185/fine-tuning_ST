Discussion Title: Is Brutal Honesty Destructive?

1. Brutal Honesty is Destructive.
1.1. Con: Freedom of speech protects the right to say whatever you want.
1.1.1. Con: To a degree; [verbal abuse](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/30098611/emotional-abuse-to-become-illegal-under-new-domestic-abuse-law), [threats](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/Criminal-Threats.htm), slurs, et cetera are not permissible even within the confines of free speech.
1.2. Con: Accepting the truth is a prerequisite for change.
1.2.1. Con: If the truth is told carefully without being brutal, it can be much more effective than just plain brutal honesty.
1.2.2. Pro: Brutal honesty makes greater impact, and lays better ground for change to occur, unlike sugar coating the honesty.
1.3. Pro: Almost always, it is possible to tell the truth without being brutal, or hiding brutal but not necessary truths. Both of these choices are better than brutal honesty so it is often a gratuitous cruelty.
1.3.1. Con: Brutal honesty is basically the truth. It's possible to prevent hard feelings without sugarcoating it.
1.3.1.1. Con: Being honest does not require the speaker to understand the truth
1.4. Con: Facts don't care about your feelings.
1.4.1. Con: Facts matter to us; we use facts for our own personal purposes \(including the purpose of understanding something correctly\). If you introduce facts to someone, taking into account those personal motives, your honesty is constructive. If you merely introduce facts for oppositional or argumentative reasons \(ignoring their motives\), your honesty is destructive.
1.4.1.1. Con: If an argument is damaged by brutal honesty, then the argument should change, not the way that the truth is delivered.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: When communicating, the point is to express information to another individual. If the intent is not clear, one possible reason is because the speaker presented the information in a way that was inaccessable to the listener.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: How the truth is delivered doesn’t necessarily change the truth.
1.4.1.1.2.1. Con: People change how the truth is delivered to change the way that someone percieves it.
1.4.1.1.2.2. Pro: Different people percieve the same media \(a sentance in our case\) [differently](http://www.medialit.net/reading-room/key-question-3-how-might-different-people-understand-message-differently-me).
1.5. Con: Lying can prevent others from making informed decisions.
1.6. Pro: Sometimes the truth is subjective.
1.6.1. Con: 'Truth' is, by definition, backed up by fact; subjectivity and truth should be mutually exclusive.
1.7. Con: People are adverse to brutal honesty because they are not used to it.
1.7.1. Con: This is not a suitable reason to permit any given behaviour; being used to a bad behaviour - say racism - does not make it any less problematic.
1.7.1.1. Con: The truth can't be compared to issues like racism even if it hurts people's feelings.
1.7.1.2. Pro: [System justification theory](http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2017/06/system-justification.aspx) states that humans seek out reasons to perpetuate a system they a reliant on.
1.7.1.2.1. Con: We shouldn't stop pursuing a just system because others pursue it with ulterior motives.
1.8. Pro: Empathy is important in reasoning.
1.8.1. Con: Reasoning should be devoid of empathy, as emotions can muddy the waters of rationality.
1.8.1.1. Con: In chapter five\(5\) of Micheal Schwalbe’s book “the sociologically examined life” it is presented that reason without empathy \(feeling with and/or for others\) can and has historically lead to destructive acts of war and human rights abuses.
1.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.1.
1.8.3. Con: It is reasonable to be empathetic \(to a certain extent\), but that doesn't mean that empathy should be placed above reason.
1.8.4. Con: Honesty obviously has connotations of good will, merely because, in telling the truth, a just person would aim to help the other. For this reason, Brutal honesty should be allowed where the motives are not to belittle another, but to constructively and critically build them.
1.9. Pro: Lying isn’t always a [bad thing](https://psychcentral.com/blog/are-white-lies-ok-in-romantic-relationships/).
1.9.1. Con: Lying to make someone feel better is not reasonable.
1.10. Con: Speaking subjective truths can open debate.
1.10.1. Con: This can be delivered in a way that avoids 'brutality'.
1.11. Pro: Brutal honesty can be used as a mask for bullying.
