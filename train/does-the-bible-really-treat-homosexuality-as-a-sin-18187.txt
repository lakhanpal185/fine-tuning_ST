Discussion Title: Does The Bible Really Treat Homosexuality As A Sin?

1. The Bible does not support the conclusion that homosexuality is a sin.
1.1. Con: The strongest evidence for the so-called “traditionalist viewpoint"—the belief that same-sex relations are forbidden in the Hebrew Bible \(Old Testament\)—is found in the two legal prohibitions in Leviticus [18:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+18&version=LEB) and [20:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20&version=LEB) and the “prime directive” of Genesis [1:22, 28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&version=ESV) and [9:1, 7,](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+9&version=ESV) “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth…”
1.1.1. Con: It would be wrong to assume God's "heteronormative intent" under the [rubric](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rubric) of reproduction. This type of thinking has had a metastasizing and historically-negative outgrowth, both religiously/legally, and culturally/linguistically—an assumption that prioritizes Genesis 2 above Genesis 1.
1.1.2. Pro: Leviticus chapter 18 verse 22 "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination" In the original hebrew the phrase "is an abomination" refers to something morally abhorant and or an idol.
1.1.2.1. Con: This prohibition has often been mischaracterized as a blanket prohibition against “homosexuality.” Yet the subject of this verse is clearly not female homosexuality, and it likely is not even male “homosexuality.” Instead, Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 seem to be prohibiting some specific form of male same-sex intercourse. It prohibits a man from engaging in anal intercourse with either a man or a woman.
1.1.3. Con: The problem with biblical law, is that it presumes familiarity with basic social institutions \(that is, “what came to be”\). Understanding Pentateuchal sexual legislation therefore requires some background knowledge of those institutions. We cannot, as a result, assume that these texts 'speak for themselves.'
1.2. Con: In interpreting the Bible, it is helpful to turn to organised religion's teaching.
1.2.1. Pro: Based on it's understanding of the Bible, the catholic church describes "homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity", and as "[intrinsically disordered](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P85.HTM)".
1.2.1.1. Con: It seems that the catholic churches stance is changing.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Speaking to a gay man, [Pope](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/20/pope-juan-carlos-cruz) Francis recently stated "that you are gay does not matter. God made you like this and loves you like this and I don’t care. The pope loves you like this. You have to be happy with who you are,"
1.2.1.1.2. Con: The Pope's recent comments do not indicate the official Catholic position.
1.2.1.1.3. Con: The Pope's comment is not even contradict the official line. It [fails](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/pope-francis-homosexuality-stance-catholic-church-same-sex-marriage-catechism-a8361821.html) to say that homosexuality is a sin.
1.2.2. Con: No one church holds a monopoly on interpreting the Bible.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Exactly. But we can know how to interpret the Bible. It's called hermaneutics, and it gives everyone the opportunity to know how to interpret scriptures. No church required. But that leaves us one-on-one with scripture and what it says.
1.2.2.2. Pro: Interpretation is subject to human fallacy
1.2.3. Con: In interpreting the Bible, the hermeneutical principles of exegesis determine original intent. These can be practiced by anyone. The Apostle Paul encouraged the people from Berea for searching the scriptures for their authority on a matter - not what an organized religion has to say.
1.2.3.1. Con: And the Apostles were themselves like Bishops, Bishops are simply the successors of them. Hierarchy is necessary for Orthodoxy, Orthodoxy is necessary for preventing division.
1.2.4. Con: For whatever ultimately-misguided reason\(s\), it has long been assumed that "laypersons" were incapable of grasping the true compositional quilting, impreciseness, multiple sourcing/authorship of, \(not to mention, soul-searching nature of the various biblical author's viewpoints\), present in every Bible we read. This middle-ages-derived, primary-school-shepherding leads one to question the ultimate utility of organized religion upon the paradigm of a biblically informed faith.
1.2.5. Pro: Most \([CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era)\) Judeo-Christian religions generally believe that non-heteronormative relationships \(between paired-humankind\) are a sin.
1.3. Pro: Paul’s use of the philosophical term “para physin,” \(correctly translated as, “to the side of Nature”\), is closely linked and bound up in several culturally-understood notions \(Greek regional/cultural influence + Paul's Roman identification/status + Jewish norms/traditions\). Given these confluences, it is possible that Paul’s belief about sexuality was biblically imprecise \(from an Old Testament perspective\), or that we are interpreting his meaning out of cultural and/or situational context.
1.3.1. Pro: From a Greek perspective, "para physin" appears in an influential work by Plato \("Laws"\), the outgrowth of which, comes after philosophers began to wrestle with the Greek institution of pederasty soon after Socrates' trial and death. While pedagogical in spirit, it started to be seen culturally \(due to the sexual nature of many of these male relationships\), as something not grounded in nature. Paul might've seen this behavior as outside the aesthetic norm as well.
1.3.2. Pro: In the Greco/Roman world, gender “maintenance” was a constant concern and was intrinsically tied to social privilege and status. As such, the Romans didn't appreciate the Greek laissez-faire attitude towards who gets to penetrate whom sexually—that is, an elite male shouldn’t occupy the ‘submissive’ role to another elite male. While Paul would’ve appreciated the androcentric strata of Romans society, he might've viewed the Roman predilection for prepubescent boys as outside the proper norm.
1.3.3. Pro: From an ancient context/understanding \(Old Testament or otherwise\) there is no distinction between same-sex and other-sex desire—all sex practices were ‘bounded.’ Still, ancient Jewish traditions [cast gentiles as excessive](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t453/e40?_hi=0&_pos=2#GeneralReferencestoSameSexPractices), especially in sexual matters—characterizing this excessiveness primarily in terms of same-sex eroticism. Given Paul’s belief in the corruption inherent in sexual passion itself, it is unlikely that Paul’s writings went beyond rebuking specific Greco/Roman sexual proclivities.
1.3.4. Pro: Perspectives on socially/biblically acceptable sexual activities & partners are historically determined. In fact, it was not until the Medieval Period \(1135–1204 C.E.\) that rabbis made male+male sexual/sensual activity “with desire” forbidden. Previously, the only sexual activity that was forbidden was anal intercourse—and no issues with homoerotic/intimate relations. Thus, it's odd to read early Christian works \(50 to ~200 C.E.\), such as Paul \(in “Romans”\) and think he was speaking universally.
1.3.4.1. Con: In the Christian worldview, ''romantic'' homosexuality is seen as impossible because romance exists for the fulfillment of marriage which is defined by God in Genesis to be between man and woman.
1.3.5. Con: The passage in Romans sets homosexuality as a sin — a development of a rebel heart that leads to lust: "Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error." \(Romans 1:26-27\)
1.4. Con: -> See 1.3.5.
1.5. Pro: The Hebrew Bible \(Old Testament\) views sexual relations \(irrespective of sexual 'orientation' or 'identity'\) as behaviors ranged on a scale—that is, a 'bounded' \(or regulated\) practice—including same-sex relations. As such, prohibitions against contextualized same-sex acts do not support the conclusion that God created human beings to be forever paired and structured as [heteronormative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heteronormative).
1.5.1. Con: Leviticus states that 'You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination'. [\(Leviticus 18:22\)](http://www.livingout.org/the-bible-and-ssa)
1.5.2. Pro: Ancient biblical norms \(what came to be\) don't properly justify modern anti-homosexual views \(what some believe ought NOT to be\).
1.5.2.1. Pro: English translations of the Bible did not even contain the word 'homosexuality' until the year [1946](https://medium.com/\@adamnicholasphillips/the-bible-does-not-condemn-homosexuality-seriously-it-doesn-t-13ae949d6619).
1.5.2.2. Pro: Neither the Hebrew Bible \(Old Testament\) nor any of the texts of the Rabbinic Period \(the first seven centuries of the Common Era\) make any mention of sexual orientation or identity. While they do mention opposite-sex and same-sex sexual activity, the only \(male\) prohibition is anal intercourse, and female same-sex intercourse was not considered sex, let alone prohibited.
1.5.3. Pro: The instructions of Moses \(from Yahweh to the now-nomadic Israelites\)—realized through narrative & laws—were to [elucidate the proper norms of living](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/book/obso-9780195288803/obso-9780195288803-sectionFrontMatter-1) ‘as a set-apart people’ from their Pagan neighbors. Rule #1: Yahweh is singularly sovereign and absolute. Rule #2, don't be like other nations.
1.5.3.1. Pro: With respect to Lev [18:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+18&version=LEB) & [20:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20&version=LEB), given Rule #2, there is a distinct possibility that the rationale underpinning this law might’ve been tied to [blurring the lines between genders](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t526/e128?_hi=20&_pos=380). That is, the man who is penetrated adopts a "woman’s sexual role." Such confusion of gender roles would've been seen as a potential threat to social order, \(as gender hierarchy was a core feature in Israelite family and communal structures\).
1.5.3.2. Pro: With respect to Lev [18:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+18&version=LEB) & [20:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20&version=LEB), given Rule #1&2, there is a distinct possibility that the rationale underpinning this law might’ve been tied to apostate worship. That is, [some scholars have postulated](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t526/e128?_hi=20&_pos=380) that the Canaanites engaged in male+male sex \(ritualistically or otherwise\), and as such, male+male relations must therefore be legally prohibitive \("bounded"\) in order to avoid apostate worship.
1.5.3.3. Pro: [Whether captives, foreign tributes, or migrants](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/book/obso-9780195139372/obso-9780195139372-div1-24), the Israelites [would’ve been assimilated](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/974456/files/53338619/download?wrap=1) into Egyptian culture & religious practices.
1.5.4. Con: It is problematic to [disavow](https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-22.htm) homosexual acts, yet claim that homosexuality is not prohibited.
1.5.5. Pro: Within the Hebrew Bible \(Old Testament\) same-sex relations—including heterosexual relations and acts—were a [‘bounded practice’](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t453/e40?_hi=0&_pos=2#SummaryandConclusion) \(that is, certain acts were considered to be outside the bounds of proper conduct\). The boundaries \(inclusive of Leviticus [18:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+18&version=LEB) and [20:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20&version=LEB)\) suggest that same-sex practices were permitted, or at least overlooked, in the biblical eras.
1.5.5.1. Pro: The Old Testament condemns any \(male\) same-sex act relating to [sexual-subjugation practices](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t453/e43?_hi=13&_pos=1#SexualViolenceasaStrategyofWarandForeignPolicy) \(of other males\)—see Deuteronomy.
1.5.5.2. Pro: The [Decalogue](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/book/obso-9780199254255/obso-9780199254255-div1-200) condemns [adultery](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/book/obso-9780195288803/obso-9780195288803-div1-75)—this would apply equally to non-heteronormative couples.
1.5.5.2.1. Con: The fact that adultery is a sin does not mean that all homosexual relations are also considered a sin.
1.5.5.3. Pro: The Old Testament condemns contextualized same-sex acts relating to prostitution \(fornication\)—this applies equally to heterosexual persons.
1.5.5.4. Pro: The [Decalogue](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/book/obso-9780199254255/obso-9780199254255-div1-200) condemns [idolatry](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/book/obso-9780195288803/obso-9780195288803-div1-75), and the Old Testament condemns contextualized \(male\) same-sex acts relating to pagan worship practices—this would apply equally to heteronormative acts \(within this same context\).
1.5.5.4.1. Pro: “Abominations”—better translated as “detestable impieties”—had a special relationship to idolatrous practices.
1.5.5.4.1.1. Pro: One such detestable activity—as it would violate God’s sovereignty—would be for an Israelite to "engage" with a Canaanite temple prostitute in their pagan fertility ritual—sex in exchange for the 'promise' of good crops. While there is little evidence to suggest that same-sex activity was taking place in ancient Israel, it is nevertheless, a modern assumption.
1.6. Con: It is helpful to distinguish between same sex attraction \(not sinful\) and actual sexual relations between members of the same sex\(sinful\). The Catholic church has consistently interpreted scripture as calling any sex outside of marriage between a man and woman sinful.
1.7. Con: Jesus in his argument about divorce referenced creation and the ideal. One man to one woman. This is the ideal. This also sets the framework not only of marriage but also for procreation. The word sin can be ‘to fall short of the ideal for which it was intended.’ In this case, all forms of sexual activity outside of hetero/marriage is technically a sin. Homosexuality or heterosexual promiscuity is also then deemed a sin. One is not worse than another.
1.8. Pro: God did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah \(see Genesis 19\) over same-sex intercourse. That idea is modern and [revisionist](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/revisionist).
1.8.1. Con: [Jude 7](https://www.catholic.com/tract/homosexuality) records that Sodom and Gomorrah "acted immorally and indulged in unnatural lust."
1.8.1.1. Pro: The same source states that the people of Sodom "indulged in sexual promiscuity". The "unnatural lust" may well be adultery.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Marriage is between only man and woman, so it's possible that Jude simply saw it as the same sin, which is arguably true.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Jude does not define “it” as homosexuality. In fact, this notion comes from two extra-biblical writers \(in the first century C.E.\) who were “updating” biblical texts to be more palatable for their modern Greek or Greco-Roman audiences—the Jewish philosopher, Philo of Alexandria, and the Jewish historian, Josephus.
1.8.2. Con: We must include the totality of Sodom's sins as evidence for God's ultimate judgment.
1.8.2.1. Con: It begs the question to presume that homosexuality was a sin at all, and so part of the "wickedness" for which they were condemned.
1.8.3. Pro: Sodom’s characteristic sin is not sexual but social and moral, \([Ezekiel makes a point of this](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/eze/16/49/s_818049) in chapter 16:49\).
1.8.3.1. Pro: The overarching grievance for the writers of this book was the violation of the [code of hospitality](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/sidebyside/bibref/NRSV/commref/NRSV/Gen/19#verse) \(as odd as this may sounds to us\). A similar narrative theme is found in [Judges 19](https://www.blueletterbible.org/nkjv/jdg/19/1/s_230001).
1.8.4. Pro: [The misconception](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-r-coats/were-sodom-and-gomorrah-r_b_656178.html?guccounter=1) comes through a misunderstanding or mistranslation of the Hebrew word ‘anasim' to mean ‘men,’ instead of people.
1.8.5. Pro: The people of Sodom had, reportedly, attempted gang [rape](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-patrick-s-cheng-phd/what-was-the-real-sin-of_b_543996.html). It is bizarre to presume that the sin for which they were being punished was homosexuality.
1.8.5.1. Con: The sins for which Sodom was destroyed were "[ongoing](https://www.str.org/articles/what-was-the-sin-of-sodom-and-gomorrah)". It was thus unlikely to be a single act such as assault.
1.9. Pro: The Creation accounts in Genesis—indeed, the entire book of Genesis—does not support the conclusion that God created human beings to be forever paired, and structured as [heteronormative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heteronormative).
1.9.1. Pro: Homosexuality, as in sexual attraction to the same sex, is not considered a sin in itself. It's the way God made one, and since God is infallible, it can not be a sin.
1.9.2. Pro: In the 1st & 2nd chapters of Genesis, God creates humankind, tells them to “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” \(1:28\), and then humankind creates a societal structure to fulfill this command \(2:24–25\). Nothing in this narrative suggests homosexual coupling is a thing that “ought NOT to be.” We just tend to assume it.
1.9.2.1. Con: If the genesis narrative is relevant then the sentence must be read in context. Gen 1:27 So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. 28 God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it... Maleness and femaleness is clearly connected to the act of multuiplying in the narrative
1.9.2.2. Con: If God is perfect, He must, therefore, create with designed, and purposeful intent. If he created the two sexes and then paired them together, then He must've intended this to be the template—so to speak—forever.
1.9.2.2.1. Con: This would only follow if all humans did naturally desire to pair together into homosexual relationships. Since many do not, God's infallibility must lead us to believe that he intended them not to enter heterosexual relationships.
1.9.2.2.1.1. Con: It is not clear at all whether sexuality is an innate part of a person or a choice. If it is the latter then it is not God's plan in action, but our own free [will](https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/free-will-in-the-bible/).
1.9.2.3. Pro: Especially with modern technological developments pertaining to childbirth and bearing, the ability to 'multiply' is equally as available to homosexuals as heterosexuals.
1.9.2.3.1. Con: This would imply that homosexuality being a sin is dependent on technological advancement
1.9.2.3.2. Pro: It would be incorrect to assume a heteronormative intent within the [rubric](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rubric) of reproduction.
1.9.2.3.2.1. Pro: It is reasonable to assume—given God's tri-omni existence \(omnipotent + omniscient + omnipresent\)—that modern technological advances would've been foreseen.
1.9.2.4. Con: At the very least, same sex couplings seem to ignore Gods command to "be fruitful and multiply".
1.9.2.4.1. Con: This logic would suggest that celibacy is also a sin, becasue this would similarly not fulfil God's command to multiply. Yet this position is not accepted by any Christian church.
1.9.3. Con: While maybe not explicitly discouraged, God created Adam and Eve and intended for them to live in the garden Eden indefinitely. If different pairings were intended, he would have created more humans to make this possible.
1.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.9.3.2. Con: Without having even numbers of male and female descendants, it is difficult to interpret the story as authority for a plan that every human live in monogamous heterosexual relationships.
1.9.3.3. Pro: The Son of God defined and then reaffirmed in Matthew 19 on what marriage is, and that it's between man and woman, with the man being dominant over the woman.
1.9.3.3.1. Con: Matthew 19 and Mark 10 differ in their telling on this story...but the context is...Jesus referenced Genesis 1:27 & 2:24 while answering a legalistic question from Pharisees regarding the legality of divorce between a man and a woman. So Christ answered \(within this context\) by giving them the applicable law regarding this topic, and then told them that marriage was supposed to be permanent. An argument against non-heterosexual coupling cannot be found within these texts.
1.9.3.3.2. Pro: When talking of the divorce, Christ still defined marriage to be between man and woman. And He defined marriage to be between man and woman in Genesis, hence ''reaffirmed'' here. He is the Word of God that became flesh for us.
1.9.3.4. Con: The main argument—the bigger picture—is that God created us, and that He didn’t create us to be specifically heteronormative.
1.9.3.4.1. Pro: Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 were [written](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/book/obso-9780195288803/obso-9780195288803-chapterFrontMatter-1) by different authors, who expressed a different worldview about the nature of creation, humanity, and God.
1.9.3.4.2. Pro: The book of Genesis is [parsable](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/book/obso-9780195288803/obso-9780195288803-div1-5) and this helps us with [inconsistencies](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/book/obso-9780195288803/obso-9780195288803-chapterFrontMatter-1) so that we can see the ‘bigger picture.’
1.9.4. Pro: Hebrew grammar refers to God with masculine possessive suffixes, pronouns, and verb forms—but not always \(Isaiah 66:13\). In fact, God hid his ‘gender’ from Moses \(Genesis 33:18-23\). Therefore, it is unknown whether Hebrew language dictated God’s gender \(as some might understand it today\) or God contains all \(4\) genders as the [early Rabbis believed](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t453/e40?_hi=0&_pos=2#AffirmativeCaseforSameSexRelations).
1.9.4.1. Pro: Presuming [heteronormative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heteronormative) intent from God’s creation, and/or "His" subsequent instructions \(see Genesis [1:22, 28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&version=ESV) and [9:1, 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+9&version=ESV) regarding the so-termed: “prime directive”\), is presupposing a definition of “in God’s image” \(see Job [38-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+38-39&version=NASB)\). The problem with this belief is that there were [four genders understood by early rabbis](http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t453/e40?_hi=0&_pos=2#AffirmativeCaseforSameSexRelations) \(male, female, androgyne, and indeterminate—not male, not female\) as being present in God.
1.9.4.2. Con: God's gender is irrelevant. His Essence is unknowable. What is relevant is God's definition of marriage in Genesis 1:16-23. And the confirmation of it in Matthew 19:4-6. There is no verse relating to marriage advice that mentions homosexual marriage, although there are verses speaking of heterosexual marriage.
1.9.4.2.1. Con: A Deity who contains all genders and no gender...a Deity who gives life and breath and pours out His “spirit upon all flesh” \(Joel 2:28; 3:1\)...calling the whole of creation “very good” \(Gen 1:31\)...is a God who reflects the variety of gendered, \(adult\) human-paired relations that have existed throughout time.
1.9.4.2.1.1. Con: Homosexuality was not found in Mankind before the Fall, nor is the Spirit filling all things relevant to homosexuality being justified or not, since the Spirit also fills things that can be agreed to not be justified in Christian such as murderers.
1.9.5. Pro: God created us in his own image \([Genesis 1:27](https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm)\). This imbues each aspect of a person with dignity that deserves respect. This includes their sexuality.
1.9.5.1. Con: This is an misunderstanding on what ''image'' means. God is incorporeal, image simply means being analogous. [More specifically, analogous to the Divine Mind and Holy Trinity. The 3 parts of our soul correspond to a Divine Person respectively.](https://www.unseenwarfare.net/anatomy-of-the-soul/) Sexuality is not relevant here.
1.9.5.2. Con: Human beings deserving respect doesn't imply every feeling they have or action they carry out deserves acceptance. For example I respect my husband's humanity enough to be horrified if he ever committed adultery. That act is not worthy of an image of God.
