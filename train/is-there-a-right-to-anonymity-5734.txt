1. Anonymity is a right.
1.1. Pro: Anonymity allows people to express themselves without fear of repercussions.
1.1.1. Pro: Anonymity can allow socially stigmatized groups \(e.g. persecuted religions, LGBTQ+, etc.\) to have dialogue and form online networks free from persecution.
1.1.2. Pro: Anonymity is [particularly valuable](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/17/protecting-online-anonymity) for people who might otherwise be unable to join the debate, such as civil servants.
1.1.3. Con: People may [use the anonymity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/better-living-technology/201408/why-the-online-trolls-troll) to engage in far uglier expressions than they would if their identity was known.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Cyber-bullying is easier if people can do it anonymously.
1.2. Con: A right to remain anonymous creates a loophole in the justice system that protects harassers, spammers, etc. from consequences.
1.3. Pro: Anonymity protects dissenters from persecution.
1.3.1. Pro: A [number](https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-governments-grow-increasingly-repressive-online-activists-fight-back) of repressive governments have reacted to the growing influence of the internet by trying to control it, anonymity is needed to protect people from these aggressive measures.
1.4. Con: Security is more important than the individual right to anonymity.
1.4.1. Pro: The right to life is always more important than the right of someone to keep something secret.
1.4.2. Pro: Anonymity directly threatens security as it makes it hard to trace people who make threats online.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Online black markets function because buyers and sellers can remain anonymous.
