1. Should Schools Push Back Start Times?
1.1. Pro: If students get more sleep then they could get better grades in school. [amp.timeinc.net](http://amp.timeinc.net/time/3663796/for-better-grades-let-your-kids-sleep-more)
1.1.1. Pro: Poor concentration, irritability and aggression are all symptoms of sleep [deprivation](https://www.universalclass.com/articles/psychology/how-sleep-affects-our-concentration.htm). Each present huge issues to classroom learning.

1.1.3. Con: Teens may stay up even later if they don't have to wake for school at an earlier time.
1.1.3.1. Pro: There would be no incentive to go for earlier nights, which sets a poor precedent for future working environments and self-discipline.
1.1.3.2. Con: Teenagers require up to ten hour's sleep a [night](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/teens-and-sleep). Extra curricular activities and homework alone mean that this is impossible if school begins too early.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: While they might decide to stay up later, at least it would not be possible for them to get sufficient sleep.
1.1.4. Con: A major lesson to learn in school is how to adapt to the working world. Creating a later start time undermines children's ability to learn this lesson.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The working world expects an early start. It it important to adjust to this as early as possible.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: For parents who work, aligning the school day with the beginning of their working day reduces childcare costs.

1.1.4.1.2. Con: Many jobs - including shift work - operates on completely random hours. It is not certain that somebody will be employed in a 9-5.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: These hours also won't match an individuals natural sleep cycle. The point remains that it is important to learn to adapt to arbitrary hours.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: Being a productive morning person requires building a [routine](http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-successful-people-do-before-breakfast-2016-8?r=US&IR=T) and habit.
1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.3.
1.3. Con: If students start later than they won’t be have as much time after school for sports and work.
1.3.1. Pro: This is particularly true in winter, when the days are shorter and so some activities are seasonally constrained.
1.3.2. Con: Sports and work can be conducted after sunset. The larger concern is that they keep children up late. Allowing for a later school start means that children have a better chance to keep up with sports and study while also getting sufficient sleep.
1.3.3. Pro: Students will also have less time to do homework.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Doing homework is an important moment of reflection for students.
1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.5. Pro: A delayed start time could help teens sleep during their natural sleep/wake cycles.
1.5.1. Pro: Most adolescents have a tendency toward later times for both falling asleep and waking up. [Research shows](https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/backgrounder-later-school-start-times/page/0/1) the typical adolescent’s natural time to fall asleep may be 11 pm or later; because of this change in their internal clocks, teens may feel wide awake at bedtime, even when they are exhausted.
1.5.2. Con: Matching sleep cycles depends on when teenagers choose to go to sleep. This will not be the same for every student. Rather than attempting to match what teenagers want, schools should set out a time and students should go to sleep in time to adapt to it.
1.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.5.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.5.5. Pro: Teenagers are [biologically](https://theconversation.com/the-biological-reason-why-its-so-hard-for-teenagers-to-wake-up-early-for-school-88802) primed to go to sleep and wake later than adults.
1.6. Pro: We've trialled this at our school during exams and the initial feedback through interviews with Staff, students and parents was extremely positive. More sleep resulting in better preparation levels was cited as the biggest positive factor. A small positive impact on results was also noted. Initial indications are worth more exploration.
1.7. Pro: Sleeping longer could reduce health-related issues that accompany sleep deprivation.
1.7.1. Pro: Later schools start time helps to encourage positive mental [health](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/11/why-are-parents-afraid-of-later-school-start-times/545642/).

1.7.4. Con: There is no reason that teens cannot go to sleep early enough that they get sufficient sleep each night.
1.7.4.1. Pro: [Homework](https://drcraigcanapari.com/homework-vs-sleep-a-cause-of-stress-in-teens/), study and extra curricular activities all prevent teenagers from going to sleep earlier.
1.8. Pro: Getting home later in the afternoon may reduce the amount of time some teens are home alone, and could decrease the likelihood teens will engage in unhealthy activities.
1.8.1. Con: Supervising teenagers 24/7 is impossible and unnecessary. It is not a problem that teenagers have some time alone in the day.

1.8.3.1. Con: Almost [43%](https://www.verywellfamily.com/do-you-do-your-childs-homework-617225) of parents actively do homework for their children. This actively stunts learning. It may in fact be better for children to do work alone.
1.9. Con: Teens would get out of school later in the afternoons, which could pose problems for teens who provide childcare to younger siblings.
1.10. Con: Delaying junior high or high school start times would likely impact the schedule for all schools within a district.
1.10.1. Pro: This has a knock on effect, putting strain on extra curricular activities after school.
