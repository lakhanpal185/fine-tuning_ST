Discussion Title: Should short-term apartment leasing services such as Airbnb be prohibited in New York City?

1. Short term apartment leasing services such as Airbnb should be prohibited in New York City.
1.1. Pro: A free market does not always shift towards the best choice for consumers or the economy, which is the case for AirBnB. As such, the government has a right and a responsibility to regulate it.
1.1.1. Pro: Airbnb is threatening to bring down the entire traditional hotel and hostel industry, which would result in a loss of jobs and instability in the economy.
1.1.1.1. Con: Access to more affordable accommodation increases the amount visitors spend on other goods and services, so more money flows to parts of the economy that serve those same groups. So, even if there were a reduction in hotel jobs, the number of jobs outside of the hotel industry would increase.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: It does not make sense that Airbnb guests would spend a great deal more. Precisely what makes people perceive Airbnb listings as affordable are the kitchen facilities and other 'extras' that prevent you spending as much in other ways. A hotel guest would be logically more likely to go for meals out, pay for parking permits, and so on, and would thus contribute more to the local economy than an Airbnb guest.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Countless studies have found people overspend or [spend frivolously](http://joyoffinancialsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/The-Psychology-of-Vacation-Overspending1.pdf) while on vacation, in part due to a sense of entitlement and a 'now-or-never' attitude when holidaying in a foreign place they may never visit again. It therefore matters little if an Airbnb guest could use the facilities available to them to be frugal; they are highly likely to go out and spend anyway.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: While it might not make rational sense, it is empirically true.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: In general, Airbnb [guests](https://www.airbnb.ie/economic-impact) stay 2.1x longer than other visitors and spend 2.1x more than those same visitors. The extra money they spend is normally spent locally in the neighbourhoods where they stay.
1.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro: One [report](https://www.airbnb.ie/press/news/airbnb-community-tops-1-15-billion-in-economic-activity-in-new-york-city) found that "The average Airbnb guest in New York stays 1.9 nights more \(5.8 nights total\) and spends $290 more at local businesses \($1,060 total\) than the typical hotel guest".
1.1.1.2. Pro: Airbnb brings down hotel prices, making it difficult for hotels to make a profit.
1.1.1.2.1. Pro: [Airbnb competition](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/technology/inside-the-hotel-industrys-plan-to-combat-airbnb.html) threatens the existence of hotel compression nights \(nights of the year when 95% of hotel rooms are occupied\), which are an incredibly important source of income for them.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: [UBS](https://qz.com/758395/airbnb-is-making-it-harder-for-hotels-to-price-gouge-customers/) estimates that hotels make anywhere from 35% to 70% more revenue per available room on these sold-out nights because of the steep premiums they can charge; the number of sold-out nights is 10-15% of all total nights, thus constituting a significant financial boost for hotels.
1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: In two of Airbnb’s biggest markets—New York and San Francisco—UBS reported that the number of compression nights [declined](https://qz.com/758395/airbnb-is-making-it-harder-for-hotels-to-price-gouge-customers/) in 2015 \(even as US hotel occupancy hit record highs\), an outcome likely owing to travellers resorting to cheaper Airbnb alternatives.
1.1.1.3. Pro: The majority of people choosing Airbnbs do so as a substitute for [a low budget or mid-range hotel](http://www.ryerson.ca/news-events/news/2016/10/why-tourists-choose-airbnb-over-hotels/), making it harder for those hotels to survive.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: According to [one study](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21601259-there-are-signs-sharing-site-starting-threaten-budget-hotels-room-all) conducted in 2014, by 2016 Airbnb would take 10% from budget hotels' takings.
1.1.1.4. Con: High-end hotels have not experienced much of a negative impact due to Airbnb.
1.1.1.4.1. Pro: Even while hotel occupancy rates themselves grew, the number of Airbnb reservations [grew further](https://www.hraadvisors.com/portfolio/economic-impacts-of-airbnb/), indicating that Airbnb is targeting a different market than would normally frequent hotels.
1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Many individuals with less disposable income, for instance, do not have the money for hotels and would not travel if they could not find a cheaper option.
1.1.1.4.2. Pro: The Marriott, Four Seasons and Hilton chains have all said Airbnb does not pose a threat to their [core market](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21601259-there-are-signs-sharing-site-starting-threaten-budget-hotels-room-all).
1.1.1.4.2.1. Con: Airbnb may not yet provide a competitive alternative to luxury hotels, but reports reveal that from the end of 2017, it will be offering a [premium service](http://www.independent.co.uk/Business/indyventure/airbnb-premium-service-luxury-travel-hotels-resorts-quality-inspectors-a7802061.html) that features only a selection of up-market, quality-inspected listings.
1.1.1.4.3. Con: Airbnb increasingly attracts business travelers who would previously have stayed in high-end hotels.
1.1.1.4.3.1. Pro: Many companies now let staff book their own itineraries and provide them with incentives to go under budget.
1.1.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: [Google](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21601259-there-are-signs-sharing-site-starting-threaten-budget-hotels-room-all) provides staff with a budget for each trip. Staff who spend less than they are allotted are given credits they can use to make donations to charities or trade in for perks such as flight upgrades on future trips.
1.1.1.4.3.2. Pro: [Concur](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21601259-there-are-signs-sharing-site-starting-threaten-budget-hotels-room-all) has reported that its number of corporate clients switching from making hotel bookings to Airbnb bookings has increased significantly because Airbnb can provide flats with multiple bedrooms and a shared workplace.
1.1.1.4.3.3. Pro: The number of business travelers staying in Airbnb's has [tripled](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airbnbs-next-frontier-business-traveler-173441386.html) in the past year, with 15% of Airbnb stays now being for business.
1.1.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.4.2.1.
1.1.1.5. Pro: New York is identified as the number one US hotel market at risk from the growth of Airbnb, with an "Airbnb Competition Index" - a measure taking into account local Airbnb and hotel rates, the scale of active Airbnb listings relative to the local hotel supply, and the overall growth of active Airbnb supply in the area - of [81.4.](http://www.cbrehotels.com/EN/Research/Pages/An-Analysis-of-Airbnb-in-the-United-States.aspx)
1.1.1.6. Pro: Before the introduction of the new laws, it was [reported](https://skift.com/2016/02/03/measuring-airbnbs-real-threat-to-u-s-hotels-using-industry-metrics/) that Airbnb posed the greatest threat to hotels in New York based on the share of the market and amount taken away from hotel revenue.
1.1.1.7. Con: There is still very much a demand for the conventional, secure accommodation that the traditional hotel industry provides.
1.1.1.7.1. Pro: In a survey, [over half](https://www.consumerreports.org/vacations/homes-away-from-home-appeals-pitfalls-of-home-sharing/) of the Americans asked said they would not even consider booking the homestays that Airbnb offers, due to the inherent uncertainty, safety concerns and an unwillingness to interact with the host.
1.1.2. Pro: Airbnb has leveraged its advantage to take a huge share of the market in a short amount of time, and it is still growing at an alarming rate, threatening to [become a monopoly](https://nltimes.nl/2017/05/31/regulate-airbnb-uber-form-monopoly-dutch-think-tank). This would bring about all the negative consequences of a monopolistic market.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Airbnb residences are not subject to the same inspections as hotel businesses, and thus do not incur the same costs.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Hotels are subject to external inspections to ensure compliance with health and safety regulations. While the residents of apartment buildings can report their landlord for failing to ensure minimum standards of health and safety, the building is not subject to external inspections unless [requested](http://www1.nyc.gov/portal/apps/311_literatures/HPD/ABCs-housing-singlepg.pdf).
1.1.2.2. Pro: Although Airbnb is not a monopoly in the conventional sense of the law, [it still uses its market dominance](http://www.bollier.org/blog/how-rein-monopoly-network-platforms) and network platforms to extract many of advantages from competitors, suppliers and consumers.
1.1.2.3. Pro: Airbnb is able to sustain a growth rate that other hotels [simply cannot](https://medium.com/\@barbcfa/has-airbnb-masterminded-the-ultimate-game-of-monopoly-cfea2483777d), given its tech-based model which lends to scalability and the lower costs of acquiring new inventory.
1.1.2.4. Pro: Sharing economies lend themselves to monopolies, by virtue of the business models they create. This could prove impossible to monitor and regulate.
1.1.2.4.1. Pro: The network effects inherent in online sharing economy platforms mean that the company with the largest network tends to escape the competition entirely.
1.1.2.4.2. Con: Regulations could just enable users to [easily swap](https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/may/20/smarter-regulation-for-the-sharing-economy) from platform to platform, provide privileges to newer platforms etc. It's just a question of creating innovative regulations.
1.1.2.4.3. Pro: The amount of data generated by businesses that make use of sharing economies gives them too much power, which could give them an unfair advantage and be dangerously powerful.
1.1.2.4.3.1. Con: This is a perfect example of a new type of regulation that could be adapted to the modern world: enforcing all of these platforms to make their data public, or limiting the type of data that they can collect.
1.1.2.5. Con: Airbnb is a 'middleman' service innovating in a densely populated hospitality market. It is far from ever becoming a monopoly.
1.1.2.6. Con: One of the main concerns of monopolistic markets is that of price-fixing, whereby the company has the power to set the market price. With Airbnb, however, a middleman who does not set prices but rather leaves that up to the host, this would not be a concern.
1.1.2.6.1. Pro: Hosts have an incentive to keep their prices down in order to compete with traditional hotels and other hosts on the site.
1.1.3. Con: Disruptive innovation, which [sustains economic growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction#Association_with_Joseph_Schumpeter), often leads to creative destruction. That's just a part of human and economic progress.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Innovation is crucial to [economic growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation_economics). Markets that rely solely on input resources and price signals are less effective in driving higher productivity
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: To place a cap on these disruptive innovations is to slow down society's economic progress.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Airbnb can offer a superior service as compared to traditional hotels and other accommodation services.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: One of the benefits of Airbnb is the "[live like a local](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/technology/airbnb-wants-travelers-to-live-like-a-local-with-its-app.html)" experience. This is highly applicable in NYC, where the size and pace of the city can inhibit an authentic tourist experience.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: The 'live like a local' experience is mainly born from the activities one does outside of one's accommodation, and information detailing how to achieve this authentic, 'insider' experience is available in thousands of unaffiliated, free [blogs](https://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-new-york-city/) [and](http://www.thisisinsider.com/real-best-things-to-do-in-nyc-2016-9#picnic-in-sheep-meadow-in-central-park-3) [articles](http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/insider-guide-new-york-city/index.html) online.
1.1.3.2.1.2. Con: Tourists are mostly [motivated](http://www.ryerson.ca/news-events/news/2016/10/why-tourists-choose-airbnb-over-hotels/) to book Airbnb accommodations because of their low cost, convenient location, and household amenities. They are generally less motivated by the opportunity to interact with the host or other locals, or by the promise of an authentic, local experience.
1.1.3.2.1.3. Con: Hotels also make up a significant number of the buildings in New York City. Tourists can get a similar experience of the city by staying in a hotel and spending time exploring the city itself.
1.1.3.2.1.4. Pro: New York apartments have famously [exorbitant prices](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/why-the-rent-is-so-high-in-new-york/). The only way that the average human is going to experience living in a real New York apartment, therefore, is via a short-term lease offered by the likes of Airbnb.
1.1.3.2.1.5. Pro: [Countless](https://www.guesty.com/airbnb-vs-hotels/) [articles](https://www.micrometrics.com/airbnb-vs-hotels-the-fight-for-the-modern-day-traveler/) and [blogs](http://theconversation.com/airbnb-social-media-and-the-quest-for-the-authentic-urban-experience-48889) have cited Airbnb's charm as being largely a result of both the opportunity to have direct communication and thus get local tips from hosts, and the personal, often more culturally authentic touches provided by hosts and their lived-in homes as opposed to sterile hotel rooms.
1.1.3.2.1.6. Pro: Airbnb's algorithms offer a personalised service that enables guests and hosts to be [matched](https://www.we-heart.com/2017/01/09/airbnb-trips-local-experiences/) according to their likes and lifestyles, making it more likely for strangers from across the world to connect with each other.
1.1.3.2.1.6.1. Pro: The new app even features an innovative [neighbourhood matching system](https://lbbonline.com/news/largest-airbnb-campaign-to-date-tells-travellers-to-live-like-a-local/) that will find the right neighbourhood in relation to the guest's likes, familial situation and past choices.
1.1.3.2.1.7. Pro: The "live like a local" feature makes tourists experience a more authentic side of the places they visit, and meet real people with whom to connect and with whom they share certain interests. This makes it more likely for them to realise what they have in common and learn from each other than mass-produced tourism would ever allow for.
1.1.3.2.1.8. Pro: Airbnb now offers [guidebooks](https://lbbonline.com/news/largest-airbnb-campaign-to-date-tells-travellers-to-live-like-a-local/) created by local hosts, which means guests can see these places from local people's perspectives and recommendations, which implicitly entails connecting with another person's way of life.
1.1.3.2.2. Con: Societies and economies functioned well for years without Airbnb. These economies are now threatened by its existence, as are the more vulnerable elements of society. Basic needs and structures therefore should take priority over luxuries such as Airbnb.
1.1.3.2.2.1. Pro: The housing crisis caused by Airbnb causes particular harm to low-income members of the community.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: Airbnb may be exacerbating a problem that has long plagued New York City. Homelessness in New York has reached its highest levels since the Great Depression of the 1930s, with research showing the [primary reason](http://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/NYCHomelessnessFactSheet_7-2017_citations.pdf) to be lack of affordable housing.
1.1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: There are an estimated 18.9 million [empty homes](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-skip-bronson/post_733_b_692546.html), but only 500,000 [homeless people](http://www.socialsolutions.com/blog/2016-homelessness-statistics/) in the United States. It stands to reason that 500,000 homeless people could easily occupy some number of the 18.9 million empty homes and, in effect, no longer be homeless. It seems safe to assume that most homeless people would live in a house if they were able to, the largest barrier preventing this is likely the money required to rent or own those empty homes.
1.1.3.2.2.1.2. Con: The reality is that rental prices of affordable units are not increasing everywhere in New York City: non-luxury, one-bedroom apartments [have fallen by 4.76%](https://www.renthop.com/studies/nyc/manhattan-migration-rents-plummet-luxury-softens) in Manhattan since the end of 2015.
1.1.3.2.2.1.2.1. Con: The fact remains that, on the whole, rental prices of affordable units have increased in a large proportion of New York City neighbourhoods: [46 neighbourhoods](https://www.renthop.com/studies/nyc/manhattan-migration-rents-plummet-luxury-softens) have showed an increase since the end of 2015, while only 34 have shown a drop.
1.1.3.2.2.1.3. Con: Airbnb is typically found in areas where rents are on the higher end of the spectrum, such as [Manhattan](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/what-is-the-cost-of-living-in-new-york-city). As such, they are not removing any listings from the affordable homes that are on the market.
1.1.3.2.2.1.3.1. Con: On the few listings that are located in other surrounding [neighbourhoods](https://davidwachsmuth.com/2017/03/13/airbnb-and-gentrification-in-new-york/), landlords are still making significantly more money than they would have in their area's long-term rental market. This is an incentive for landlords in other, less expensive rental areas of the city to switch from providing long-term rentals to short-term Airbnb leases.
1.1.3.2.2.1.4. Con: Airbnb is a way for regular citizens, [especially non-traditional workers](https://blog.atairbnb.com/economic-impact-airbnb/), to generate an additional income to support their daily spendings. This means residents are more likely to afford the cost of living rather than the other way around.
1.1.3.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: A [comprehensive study](https://skift.com/2016/01/20/airbnb-data-highlights-from-penn-states-year-long-host-study/) found that full-time hosts represent just 3.3% of hosts on Airbnb.
1.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Yet that [same study](https://skift.com/2016/01/20/airbnb-data-highlights-from-penn-states-year-long-host-study/) finds that multiple-unit operators account for 40% of all Airbnb revenue, any 24% of the revenue in NYC, meaning they are the ones making the most use of the platform.
1.1.3.2.2.1.4.1.2. Pro: A 2015 study shows [90 percent of Airbnb hosts in New York share their primary residence](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/press/news/airbnb-community-tops-1-15-billion-in-economic-activity-in-new-york-city).
1.1.3.2.2.1.4.2. Pro: [A study](http://2sqy5r1jf93u30kwzc1smfqt-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AirbnbandtheBerlinhousingmarket.pdf) conducted in Berlin found that the vast majority of Airbnb users are private individuals \(i.e. not private landlords\), 41% of whom rely on their additional income to earn their living.
1.1.3.2.2.1.4.3. Pro: [62% of Airbnb hosts](https://blog.atairbnb.com/economic-impact-airbnb/) say that the additional income earned from using Airbnb to let out rooms helped them afford to stay in their homes.
1.1.3.2.2.1.4.4. Pro: Especially in low-income neighbourhoods, Airbnb listings are disproportionately "private rooms" rather than "entire homes". This indicates that homeowners are subletting parts of the place they live in in order to supplement their income and that the majority of hosts are letting these rooms on the side \([Coles et al, p. 1](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3048397)\).
1.1.3.2.2.1.4.4.1. Con: The same study shows that higher income neighbourhoods are much more popular than low income ones, indicating that the people who profit from Airbnb are those who are already well-off \([Coles et al, p. 9](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3048397)\).
1.1.3.2.3. Pro: Airbnb has launched an ['Experiences'](http://fortune.com/2017/09/27/airbnb-experiences-daily-app-hotel/) feature on their app, allowing guests to access exclusive activities in various locations.
1.1.3.2.4. Pro: Airbnb offers cheaper accommodation than hotels.
1.1.3.2.4.1. Pro: Airbnb functions via peer-to-peer buying and marketing, in which there are fewer of the constraints \(like security and real estate costs\) that plague traditional hotel and lodging companies. As a result, there are fewer - and lower - transaction fees for the consumer.
1.1.3.2.4.2. Con: For a basic overnight stay, Airbnb accommodation does not work out cheaper than other forms of lodging for travellers: in a CBRE Hotels [report](https://skift.com/2016/02/03/measuring-airbnbs-real-threat-to-u-s-hotels-using-industry-metrics/), the Average Daily Rate in the USA for Airbnb rooms was $148.42, while hotels had an ADR of $119.11 and a traditional bed and breakfast was $103.25.
1.1.3.2.4.3. Pro: Airbnb is much better value for money for travellers: units tend to have more services and features than a hotel room, including kitchens, additional bedrooms, and parking, depending on market.
1.1.3.2.5. Pro: Airbnb offers unique benefits for vacationing families.
1.1.3.2.5.1. Pro: It is often hard for families with children to find individual hotel rooms or adjoining hotel rooms that will accommodate their group.
1.1.3.2.5.2. Pro: Whole home rentals allow more space for children to play in comparison to hotels which are generally much smaller.
1.1.3.2.6. Pro: Airbnb is uniquely responsive to what users desire and innovates accordingly much faster than hotels.
1.1.3.2.6.1. Con: One of Airbnb's USPs - a high level of digital connectivity that runs between guest and host, and part of what allows for such quick adaptation - can be replicated by hotels.
1.1.3.2.6.1.1. Pro: [Most](http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-hotels-should-adapt-to-growing-threat-airbnb-2015-7?r=US&IR=T) hotel operators told PricewaterhouseCoopers that many are making large investments in digital connectivity to this end.
1.1.3.2.6.1.2. Pro: In response to travelling customers' increasing desire for greater choice and control over their experiences, [Hilton Worldwide Inc.](http://newsroom.hilton.com/index.cfm/news/hilton-revolutionizes-hotel-experience-with-digital-checkin-room-selection-and-customization-and-checkout-across-650000plus-rooms-at-more-than-4000-properties-worldwide) have launched digital check-in and -out, room selection and many digitally customisable features and requests. This allows their customers to almost-instantaneously adapt their experience to their needs.
1.1.3.2.6.2. Pro: Airbnb directly asks users what changes they should make, using Twitter and their online community forum.
1.1.3.2.6.2.1. Pro: Brian Chesky, co-founder and CEO of Airbnb, regularly [tweets](https://twitter.com/bchesky/statuses/910590548033003520) such questions.
1.1.3.2.6.2.1.1. Pro: In response to Airbnb and users wanting more dining options through Airbnb, the latter partnered with [Resy](http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/20/technology/airbnb-restaurants-booking-resy/index.html) to allow guests to make restaurant reservations through Airbnb.
1.1.3.2.6.3. Pro: At times of peak seasonality, the nature of Airbnb means that it has an elasticity of accommodation availability that hotels simply cannot match.
1.1.3.2.6.3.1. Pro: On New Year's Eve 2015, Airbnb hosted [twice as many](https://skift.com/2015/12/17/airbnb-set-to-top-one-million-bookings-for-a-single-night-on-new-years-eve/) guests as it had hosted just one year before; any hotel would have to build significant additional lodging at an unrealistic speed to adapt to the same surge in demand so quickly.
1.1.3.2.7. Con: The success of Airbnb risks putting traditional accommodation services out of business. This would make it particularly difficult for members of society for whom Airbnb is inaccessible to travel.
1.1.3.2.7.1. Con: Because AirBnB is often staying in someone's home, not everyone will want to use Airbnb.  Therefore, there will always be a market for hotels and other traditional short term accommodation for the minority who can't use AirBnB.
1.1.3.2.7.2. Pro: Elderly or under-age travellers may need the regulation, security and comprehensive services that hotels provide, as their age prevents them from exercising the same level of independence as other travellers. Airbnb's nature means that it cannot readily meet these kinds of needs.
1.1.3.2.7.3. Pro: Services such as Airbnb require a digital, peer-to-peer buying arrangement. This can be an obstacle for the youngest and oldest members of the population.
1.1.3.2.7.3.1. Pro: The exclusively digital nature of Airbnb's platform makes it inaccessible for members of society who are less technologically savvy.
1.1.3.2.7.3.2. Pro: The semi-anonymous nature of online exchanges can be alienating for older members of society for whom this is not the norm.
1.1.3.2.7.3.3. Con: Almost all hotel booking systems are digital too.
1.1.3.2.7.4. Pro: Travellers and hosts must be [at least 18](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/terms#sec2) years of age to use Airbnb services; no underage young people are thus able to make use of Airbnb, regardless of whether it provides better services for them than a hotel would.
1.1.3.2.7.5. Pro: Only [7%](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-burbank/the-rise-of-the-sharing-e_b_5454710.html) of those aged 50-64 or under 20 are willing to share their assets or rent those of others in a share community, suggesting that they either do not want or are not able to partake in the kind of collaborative consumption Airbnb must involve.
1.1.3.2.8. Pro: Airbnb is a safer and more efficient form of couch-surfing: it adds safety to both parties while allowing the payment process to be managed independently.
1.1.3.3. Pro: History has seen these types of disruptive innovations lead to the demise of other, more established businesses time and time again: computers replaced typewriters, mass farming replaced low-scale agriculture. These are advances that maximise society's ability to meet consumers' needs.
1.1.3.4. Pro: In the long-run, [competition](http://www.indianeconomy.net/splclassroom/296/creative-destruction-and-disruptive-innovations/) under capitalism is defined by who can discover new technologies and business models, thereby expanding the range of available products, changing daily life and destroying existing industries.
1.1.4. Pro: Airbnb makes it difficult to ensure that civil rights with respect to accommodation are protected.
1.1.5. Con: The success of Airbnb despite the lack of regulation indicates that regulation is not needed to protect consumers.
1.1.5.1. Con: Just because Airbnb is popular with its users \(the people who benefit from it the most\) does not mean it does not cause harm to other elements of society. Regulation must therefore be implemented to curb these harms.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Unregulated mass tourism has many negative side-effects in New York City. Airbnb facilitates this kind of tourism.
1.1.5.1.1.1. Pro: [35%](https://www.airbnbaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Airbnb-Community-Compact.pdf) of the people who travel on Airbnb say they would not have travelled or stayed as long at their travel destination but for Airbnb.
1.1.5.1.1.2. Con: Targeting a specific company \(Airbnb\) to address a general problem \(tourism\) is unfair. A general solution, such as a tourism tax, would be less discriminatory.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1. Con: The attempts to control mass tourism in New York include strict zoning laws. Airbnb users flout these laws.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Airbnb operates in locations designated as residential areas. They are not designated as 'tourist' or 'commercial' zones.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Many Airbnbs undoubtably operate in areas zoned for hotels and other forms of traditional accommodation. Banning Airbnbs rather than enforcing zoning laws as they actually apply is discriminatory.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: It is impractical, on both Airbnb's and the relevant governmental authority's ends, to be able to police listings to ensure compliance with zoning laws.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Airbnb facilitates property listings worldwide. It is impractical to expect Airbnb to be able to police individual listings for local law infractions.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: If government regulated to mandate that Airbnb police listing in a particular state, then it would be possible for Airbnb to raise prices and employ more staff. This solution is feasible.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: If service fees increased, people would choose not to use Airbnb and it would have the effect of stifling innovation.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: Government authorities seem perfectly capable of enforcing existing zoning laws and other small regulations on the myriad of small businesses that exist within New York City.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.2.1.3. Con: Presumably the zoning overlay maps could be pretty easily cross-referenced against the map of listings that Airbnb offers.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.3. Con: The use of zoning laws to restrict hotels/motels exist to prevent dramatic changes to the population density or building density within an area. As Airbnb uses existing buildings, and its visitors temporarily displace existing residents, there is no reason for them to fall under zoning controls.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The amount of tourists regularly in an area can affect the kind of services provided in that area.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Mass tourism caused rapid gentrification in [Barcelona](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/mass-tourism-kill-city-barcelona).
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Pro: Unregulated tourism caused gentrification in [Venice, Italy](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/death-of-venice-visitors-are-killing-our-city-2360518.html) to the extent that the residential population of the city is now a third of what it was six decades ago. This was partly facilitated by the short-term letting of apartments for tourists.
1.1.5.1.1.2.1.4. Pro: However, some Airbnb hosts constantly use their apartments to host guests. This is different to the idea of a once off lending arrangement. It does alter the use of the building.
1.1.5.1.1.2.2. Con: There are already a myriad of taxes levied by the New York State government for hotels, such as occupancy taxes. These, however, are not always collected by Airbnb hosts, which is in contravention of state law.
1.1.5.1.1.2.2.1. Con: If one hotel chain didn't pay their taxes that would not mean that New York City would be justified in shutting down all hotel chains. Again, laws should be enforced against those people who actually break them.
1.1.5.1.1.2.3. Pro: Moderation, not prohibition is what is needed. This arguably knee-jerk prohibition can be harmful and regressive to the interests of big city constituents.
1.1.5.1.1.3. Pro: Unregulated mass tourism can cause the cost of local goods and services to rise above what residents can afford.
1.1.5.1.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.
1.1.5.1.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.2.1.3.1.2.
1.1.5.1.1.3.3. Con: Price increases as a result of mass tourism will only occur on certain commodities. Fast food chains, clothing stores, and other chain stores that market themselves as selling cheap goods are not likely to change their prices.
1.1.5.1.1.3.3.1. Con: There will be fewer stores that market themselves as cheap if tourists who are willing to spend money in more expensive stores and restaurants flood an area.
1.1.5.1.1.3.3.1.1. Pro: The last local underwear store in Venice closed ten years ago and was [replaced](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/mass-tourism-kill-city-barcelona) with designer options to cater to the demands of wealthy tourists, but which residents cannot afford.
1.1.5.1.1.3.3.1.2. Con: This is untrue for most large department stores, family owned places, and fast food chains. They have created a base of consumers that they would lose if they raised prices. If they keep prices the same, they can keep their base consumers while also competing with expensive stores for tourist revenue.
1.1.5.1.1.3.4. Pro: People who live in touristy areas risk being forced out as landlords, shops and restaurants raise their prices to take advantage of the tourist market.
1.1.5.1.1.3.5. Pro: With the promise of a booming tourist market, shops that used to provide services to locals may adapt to offer services that only tourists would want. This reduces the amount of choice and competition in markets that locals want to access.
1.1.5.1.1.3.6. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.4.
1.1.5.1.1.3.7. Con: Increased costs on some items will be balanced out by decreasing costs of access to public services such as transport and schools, because of the increased tax revenue from tourist purchases and tourist oriented businesses.
1.1.5.1.1.4. Pro: A city hosting an unregulated number of tourists leads to increases in petty crime, rowdy behaviour and general disruption.
1.1.5.1.1.4.1. Con: Tourists tend to be better behaved than local residents.
1.1.5.1.1.4.1.1. Con: Online news articles support that people [consume more alcohol](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2670592/Boozy-Brits-abroad-Half-drink-day-holiday-admit-start-drinking-DEPARTURE-LOUNGE-says-Alcohol-Concern-study.html) and are more likely to take part in [reckless activities](http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/674130/Fun-sun-Britons-reckless-drink-MORE-abroad-holiday) - including speeding, drug-taking, drunk and disorderly behaviour, and indecent exposure - while on vacation than at home.
1.1.5.1.1.4.1.2. Con: Tourists may be better-behaved, but they are seen as easy and lucrative targets by pick-pockets and other petty, serial offenders. This brings more crime to tourist-heavy areas, negating the positive effect that 'well-behaved' tourists could otherwise have on crime rates in the destinations they visit.
1.1.5.1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: [Studies](https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&context=hhrc) \(pp. 4-5\) show that when tourists visit destinations where there is already a high crime rate, there is a higher likelihood for them than there is for permanent residents of becoming a victim. However, this probability corresponds more or less to the existing crime rate in any given location, suggesting that tourists do not attract criminals to an area, but rather become victims of crime more easily in areas where crime is already prevalent.
1.1.5.1.1.4.1.2.2. Con: Those criminals who target tourist-heavy areas are then not targeting other areas where locals are prevalent. In doing so crime rates in those areas would drop, and fewer locals overall would encounter crime.
1.1.5.1.1.4.1.2.3. Con: Tourists' good behaviour is not the only way they can reduce crime in a destination: the tourism industry requires more workers and increases employment, and increases a popular area's chance of being modernised and rebranded.
1.1.5.1.1.4.1.3. Pro: Those with the means to travel are less likely to commit crime than a general population, as [crime is linked to a lack of economic resources and opportunities](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Crime%26Inequality.pdf).
1.1.5.1.1.4.1.4. Pro: Crime can be either premeditated or stem from opportunism. In either case, it is likely that people are more likely to commit crimes in a familiar setting where they think they are less likely to be caught.
1.1.5.1.1.4.1.4.1. Con: Criminals have a greater chance of being identified in areas that are familiar to them, thereby increasing the chances of getting caught.
1.1.5.1.1.4.1.4.2. Pro: Environmental criminologists theorise that an offender is most likely to commit crime in their ['awareness space'](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/criminology/obsolete-pages/sf101/TraveltoCrimepdf) \(p.2\) -  the space in which they spend a lot of time and with which they are therefore very familiar.
1.1.5.1.1.4.2. Pro: Travellers will not be vetted in the same manner as long term leasers. They could have a record of causing disturbances to neighbours or damaging property, and still be permitted to stay in Airbnb listings.
1.1.5.1.1.4.2.1. Pro: While there is an increasing pressure on AirBnB to better vet hosts, there is [little to no vetting](https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Help/Better-vetting-of-guests-Airbnb-penalties-for-declining-too-many/td-p/204964) for guests - people can simply sign up, provide a valid credit card and use the website.
1.1.5.1.1.4.2.2. Con: Airbnb hosts can review guests to let future hosts know if they are a risk.
1.1.5.1.1.5. Pro: Short-term leases are more lucrative and financially promising for landlords than long-term ones. More and more landlords are thus likely to shift from long-term to short-term leasing, thereby [driving up rent prices](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/17/airbnb-rent-unaffordable-elizabeth-warren-neighborhoods) and reducing the supply of long-term accommodation.
1.1.5.1.1.5.1. Con: This is true regardless of whether Airbnb exists.
1.1.5.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: A long-term rental is a more reliable source of income whereas a short-term rental is more likely to experience vacancy gaps; hence the difference in price.
1.1.5.1.1.5.1.1.1. Con: The reliability of long-term renting is probably preferable from the perspective of increasing the overall supply of housing as it provides a more stable investment return.
1.1.5.1.1.5.1.1.2. Con: Airbnb facilitates and encourages people to do these short-term rentals, whether it is to locals or tourists. It hugely exacerbates the problem and therefore lies at its heart.
1.1.5.1.1.5.1.1.2.1. Pro: Without Airbnb, finding the right people, dealing with payments and advertising the apartment becomes much more difficult and expensive, meaning most people would opt for the long-term alternative instead. With Airbnb that all changes.
1.1.5.1.1.5.2. Con: Rental prices on luxury apartments have fallen - sometimes steeply - in [24 out of 35](https://www.renthop.com/studies/nyc/manhattan-migration-rents-plummet-luxury-softens) New York City neighbourhoods since the end of 2015. This logically increases the amount of housing that could be affordable for a larger proportion of the NYC population.
1.1.5.1.1.5.3. Pro: The Attorney General of New York State [reported](https://ag.ny.gov/pdfs/AIRBNB%20REPORT.pdf) that private short-term rentals displaced long-term residents \(pp 3, 12\), contributing to an increased demand on the limited available housing.
1.1.5.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: The effect of the short term loans meant that the properties were unavailable for long term residents.
1.1.5.1.1.5.4. Pro: There is evidence from multiple locations that the presence of Airbnb increases rent prices of nearby housing.
1.1.5.1.1.5.4.1. Pro: In 2014, [rents in LA neighbourhoods](https://howhousingmatters.org/articles/airbnb-making-los-angeless-affordable-housing-crisis-worse/) with a high number of Airbnb listings were 20% higher and increased 33% faster than rents citywide.
1.1.5.1.1.5.4.1.1. Con: It seems logical that more Airbnb listings are set up in the more popular parts of LA than in the less popular ones. Rents in popular areas would tend to be higher to begin with and experience more rapid increases anyway, irrespective of Airbnb's presence.
1.1.5.1.1.5.4.2. Pro: The Sydney Urban Housing Lab reported that 6000 homes have been removed from Sydney's permanent housing market and placed on short-term stay platforms such as Airbnb, which it predicted were major [contributors](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/how-shortterm-rental-apps-are-making-sydneys-housing-crisis-worse-20170918-gyjgiy.html) to the increase of house, land and rental prices.
1.1.5.1.1.5.4.3. Pro: [In Barcelona](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-09/barcelona-cracks-down-on-tourist-rentals-as-rents-rise/8506708), rent is being driven up at a rate of 6%/year due to people making use of sites like Airbnb to rent out their rooms to foreigners who can pay more than locals.
1.1.5.1.1.5.5. Con: The main reason for housing shortages in New York is the city itself — it is so popular with travellers and professionals alike that demand for housing is nearly endless.
1.1.5.1.1.5.5.1. Pro: High rents and a strong economy are preferable to lower rents and a weak economy. Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore have avoided a crisis of affordable housing because they're dangerous, dysfunctional places that are losing their population.
1.1.5.1.1.5.6. Pro: An advantage of short-term leases is that they carry fewer risks if life circumstances change. This is an additional reason for why people favour short-term contracts over long-term ones.
1.1.5.1.1.5.7. Pro: The laws relating to Airbnb have enabled some users to start commercial enterprises based on the renting and leasing of short-term tenancies.
1.1.5.1.1.5.7.1. Pro: Between 2010 to June 2014, it is [reported](https://ag.ny.gov/pdfs/AIRBNB%20REPORT.pdf) by the Attorney General of New York State that 37% of revenue generated by Airbnb came from hosts who had three or more listings \(p 2\).
1.1.5.1.1.5.7.2. Pro: The New York State Attorney General, [reported](https://ag.ny.gov/pdfs/AIRBNB%20REPORT.pdf) that 124 hosts operated major commercial ventures, hosting 10 or more properties \(p 11\).
1.1.5.1.1.5.7.2.1. Pro: Between 2010 to June 2014, it is reported by the Attorney General of New York State that the [12 top commercial hosts](https://ag.ny.gov/pdfs/AIRBNB%20REPORT.pdf) on Airbnb earned revenue exceeding $1 million. These commercial hosts controlled 10 or more listings \(p 3\).
1.1.5.1.1.5.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.5.7.2.1.
1.1.5.1.1.5.7.4. Pro: Airbnb's [own statistics](https://airbnb.app.box.com/s/0k73ecqlfzi9u1c7fccheu45iit6dcnz/1/5606850377/45517799029/1) \(p. 3\) reveal that two-thirds of its London hosts make more than the UK median income, and nearly half of them make more than £43,000 a year, putting them in the top 15 percent of earners in the UK.
1.1.5.1.1.5.7.4.1. Con: This statistic does not link Airbnb rentals as being the cause of the host's wealth, it merely points out that many hosts are wealthy.
1.1.5.1.1.5.7.5. Con: Airbnb has [stated](https://qz.com/842996/what-happens-when-a-30-billion-startup-stops-being-nice-and-starts-being-real/) that it would purge the worst offenders from its platform, starting in New York.
1.1.5.1.1.5.7.6. Pro: [A report](https://anhd.org/why-airbnb-is-bad-for-affordable-housing/) using data subpoenaed from Airbnb found that in New York City there are 1,406 hosts renting out anywhere between 3 and 272 units on the platform.
1.1.5.1.1.5.8. Pro: There are [online articles](http://prospect.org/article/evictions-and-conversions-dark-side-airbnb) detailing experiences of long-term residents who have been suddenly evicted due to their landlords opting for short-term leases on Airbnb.
1.1.5.1.1.5.9. Con: Short term rentals are becoming increasingly [less profitable](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171012006448/en/New-Findings-NYU-Stern-NYU-Wagner-Airbnb) for New York City landlords. On average, an apartment must now be rented for at least 216 days worth of short-term rentals to achieve the profit landlords would make on a year of comparatively lower effort long-term rentals.
1.1.5.1.1.5.9.1. Pro: If landlords are finding it difficult to generate a profit, it is likely they will switch back to renting their property using long-term leases.
1.1.5.1.1.6. Con: Tourism via Airbnb promotes authentic, cross-cultural connections and diversifies the communities in which it operates.
1.1.5.1.1.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.5.
1.1.5.1.1.6.2. Con: Cross-cultural relationships can only be harboured to the extent that guests and hosts are able to communicate properly with each other in the first place. Some Airbnb hosts [complain](https://community.withairbnb.com/t5/Hosting/Airbnb-cross-cultural-and-transnational-experience-Lost-in/td-p/357618), for example, that guests send blunt messages translated by google and misunderstand instructions because they do not speak the host language.
1.1.5.1.1.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.1.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.
1.1.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.3.
1.1.5.2. Pro: Airbnb has booked over 5 million nights and has [over 2.1 million](https://www.fastcompany.com/1835654/airbnb-numbers-85-users-inactive) registered users, and its customer base is growing by about 250% every year. There is therefore significant demand for the service.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Governments should only regulate in the case of clear and present harms to first parties. On the face of it, the ongoing success of AirBnB with its customers suggest there is no problem given the potential harms it poses are nebulous, indirect, and difficult to both identify and address directly.
1.1.5.4. Pro: The free market would not allow Airbnb to be successful if it did not make individuals better off. Consumers buy the best product for the lowest price, and Airbnb offers exactly that. If Airbnb made consumers worse off, consumers would prioritize competitors and other ways to better satisfy the need that they are willing to pay for.
1.1.6. Con: As a general principle, the government should interfere with the market as little as possible - preferably not at all.
1.1.6.1. Pro: John Stuart Mill argued the [Harm Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_principle) by stating:  "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others".
1.1.6.2. Pro: The market will, in either the short term or the long term, always reach equilibrium, where resources are allocated at peak efficiency for peak prices. Government intervention slows and potentially impedes that process.
1.1.6.2.1. Con: While the market might reach equilibrium, private companies don't take into consideration negative externalities that lead to socially inefficient outcomes.
1.1.6.2.2. Con: Opposition to regulation is based on the assumption that perfect competition exists and that markets will always self-correct. However, in the real world, competition is [always imperfect](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/perfectcompetition.asp).
1.1.6.3. Pro: The protection of failing industries, like the traditional hotel industry, reduces the need for businesses to be efficient and competitive.
1.1.6.4. Pro: Airbnb would not exist if homeowners did not want to provide short term rental. Removing Airbnb will not remove that demand, and will only lead to market inefficiency as people develop workarounds.
1.1.7. Con: Short term apartment leasing is currently illegal in New York but many people are still doing it. This shows that prohibition does not work.
1.1.7.1. Con: The point of prohibition laws are not necessarily to stop every instance of an activity, but to reduce their prevalence.
1.1.7.2. Pro: Prohibition usually increases the demand for and price of a good, further incentivizing people to enter the [black market](https://fee.org/articles/rent-my-flat-black-market-edition/) for said good.
1.1.7.3. Pro: So far, New York City has only managed to crack down on [139 of more than 23,000](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/5/11/15626876/new-york-anti-airbnb-law-enforcement-issues) potentially illegal listings; according to a study, it would take inspectors [43 years](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170509/REAL_ESTATE/170509873) to issue violations to the rest of these at the current rate.
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: A law that is effectively unenforceable due to staffing issues will never work as a deterrent.
1.1.7.3.2. Pro: It is unjust to punish such a small percentage of those with illegal listings. This represents arbitrary and inconsistent application of the law.
1.1.7.3.3. Con: The mayor of New York City is planning to put an extra [$2.9 million](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170426/REAL_ESTATE/170429915/mayor-bill-de-blasio-budgets-1-6-million-to-crack-down-on-airbnb) into the enforcement of this law over the next two fiscal years, hiring more building inspectors, lawyers and police officers, among other staff.
1.1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.3.
1.1.7.5. Pro: There are currently more than [30,215 active listings](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/7/31/16068206/airbnb-new-york-listings-numbers) in New York City.
1.1.8. Con: Regulation at the city level is too broad and 'one size fits all' — it makes the assumption that all neighborhoods and buildings hold the same values, when in reality some have problems with the effects of short term leasing and others do not.
1.1.9. Pro: Airbnb constitutes a major added competitor in the hotel and lodging industry, thus causing or exacerbating consequences of an over-saturated market.
1.1.9.1. Con: Airbnb reduces the risk of hotel and lodging businesses overdeveloping, thus mitigating the negative impacts of overdevelopment in New York City.
1.1.9.1.1. Pro: Airbnb [data](https://www.airdna.co/) could be used by hotels to identify locations where their businesses will be impacted the most by Airbnb competition, and where there is therefore no value in investing in new developments. Hotel businesses can thus use Airbnb to reduce their own risk of wasting money through overbuilding.
1.1.9.1.1.1. Con: This only benefits hotel chains looking to expand or people looking to open new hotels. It does not benefit existing hotels.
1.1.9.1.2. Pro: Through reducing the need or temptation to construct more traveller accommodation, Airbnb reduces the environmental impacts of overdevelopment in New York City.
1.1.9.1.2.1. Pro: [60%](https://www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Wildlife/EndangeredbySprawl.pdf) of the USA’s rarest and most imperilled species occur in its designated metropolitan areas \(p. 13\), and urban sprawl - due in large part to overdevelopment - can be one of the leading causes of species imperilment in some cases \(pp.13-14\).
1.1.9.1.2.2. Pro: Green spaces in and around cities such as NYC provide [numerous ecological services](https://www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Wildlife/EndangeredbySprawl.pdf) to human wellbeing and economy: purifying drinking water, recharging aquifers, helping prevent droughts, protecting against floods, and helping to maintain a stable climate \(p.15\). Reducing overdevelopment preserves these green spaces and the benefits they carry for humans.
1.1.9.1.2.3. Con: Environmentally contaminated brownfields, of which there are many in highly urbanised areas, are neither environmentally nor economically valuable if left undeveloped. Building hotels on such sites would make more sense than leaving them as they are.
1.1.9.1.2.3.1. Con: If new developments are to be built, it makes more sense for them to be environmentally efficient condominiums, which create not only jobs, but also permanent housing.
1.1.9.1.3. Pro: Urban and suburban areas in the USA have [grown](https://www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Wildlife/EndangeredbySprawl.pdf) by nearly 300% since 1955, while population has risen by only 75% \(p.13\); development of urbanised areas beyond the population's needs is thus a significant problem that must be palliated by any means possible. Through reducing hotel overdevelopment, Airbnb is one means to this end.
1.1.9.1.4. Con: The reductions in hotel overdevelopment that Airbnb may bring are negated by the increase in residential developments that could be triggered by the removal of many New York City apartments from the permanent-housing market at the hands of Airbnb hosts.
1.1.9.1.5. Con: Overdevelopment had already significantly decreased in New York City by the time Airbnb was created: the building boom between 2000 and 2008 was the [2nd smallest](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/is-overdevelopment-still-a-threat/) of the last 6 decades \(Spinola\).
1.1.9.2. Pro: An atmosphere of survival of the fittest is created, meaning that many hotel businesses are tempted to increase their prices but cut their costs. This means that Airbnb's presence will lead to hotels becoming not only more expensive, but also worse in quality.
1.1.9.2.1. Pro: Lodging businesses are tempted to make instant savings in any way possible to survive anticipated periods of financial loss, rather than holding off in favour of creating smart business plans that could mitigate these losses long-term.
1.1.9.2.2. Con: The atmosphere of survival of the fittest is true of any market in the world. This high level of competition is what leads to an improved quality of service for customers, a wider variety of choice and more competitive prices.
1.1.9.2.3. Con: Companies who both raise their prices and decrease their quality will simply go out of business, as other competitors such as Airbnb offer better and cheaper services.
1.1.9.3. Con: Over-demand actually leads to prices falling, not rising. Competitors who raise their prices will simply be undercut by the heavy competition.
1.1.9.4. Con: Airbnb's innovation simply challenges the hotel industry to innovate and adapt to society's changing demands and behavioural traits, thereby driving progress and new technology.
1.1.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.2. Pro: Full time airbnb units undermine communities and neighborhood civic life and engagement because they remove the possibility for neighbors who are invested in the life and culture of place, replacing them with transient people who do not know the people and history, or the issues there, and have no reason to invest in strengthening the neighborhood or getting to know the residents as friends.
1.3. Pro: Airbnb is unsafe and puts people at risk of damage and harm.
1.3.1. Con: If the risks were that high, people would have ceased to use Airbnb.
1.3.2. Con: These risks are not inherent to the service itself, but to the way hosts and guests use it.
1.3.3. Con: Airbnb poses risks primarily to the hosts, who have opted-in to those risks and are covered by Airbnb's insurance policies.
1.3.3.1. Con: There have been numerous reports of guests being mistreated during their stay
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Some hosts try to scam guests into having to pay for [damage](https://www.airbnbhell.com/paying-hosts-remodel-damage-present/) to the property that was already there when the guests arrived.
1.3.3.1.2. Pro: Some hosts [cancel](https://www.airbnbhell.com/airbnb-cancelled-month-long-stay-week-flight/) last minute.
1.3.3.1.3. Pro: Guests have experienced [bed bugs](https://www.airbnbhell.com/fleas-bed-airbnb-host-wind/) in some Airbnbs.
1.3.3.1.4. Pro: Some hosts do not advertise [pets](https://www.airbnbhell.com/airbnb-hosts-shouldnt-skip-important-details/) who live in the apartment, which can be a problem for some guests.
1.3.3.1.5. Con: Many guests also have bad experiences at hotels. The rapid popularity of Airbnb speaks to how it provides a better average experience than alternatives.
1.3.3.1.6. Pro: There have been multiple instances where guests have discovered they were being [filmed](http://fortune.com/2017/10/11/airbnb-hidden-camera/) in their Airbnb.
1.3.3.1.7. Pro: There are numerous reports of racial discrimination taking place through Airbnb bookings.
1.3.3.1.7.1. Pro: One hosted cited the prospective guest's race as her reason for [cancelling](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/13/airbnb-california-racist-comment-penalty-asian-american) her booking.
1.3.3.1.7.2. Pro: Black guests often find it more [difficult](http://fortune.com/2016/09/15/airbnb-racism-black/) to have their booking requests accepted than white guests.
1.3.3.1.7.2.1. Pro: One guest had his booking [rejected](https://medium.com/stay-woke/i-read-about-this-phenomenon-of-black-people-being-rejected-on-airbnb-f36dd3ab0375). When his white friend tried booking the same property for the same dates the booking was accepted.
1.3.3.1.7.2.1.1. Pro: The same guest had the same issue with another host. After making a profile where he pretended to be white his booking was accepted.
1.3.3.1.7.2.2. Pro: A [study](http://www.benedelman.org/publications/airbnb-guest-discrimination-2016-09-16.pdf) conducted by Harvard Business School found that "requests from guests with distinctively African-American names are roughly 16% less likely to be accepted than identical guests with distinctively White names".
1.3.3.1.7.3. Con: Airbnb are reexamining their [non-discrimination policy](http://blog.atairbnb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/REPORT_Airbnbs-Work-to-Fight-Discrimination-and-Build-Inclusion.pdf?3c10be) and looking to improve upon it.
1.3.3.2. Pro: [Airbnb's insurance scheme](https://www.airbnb.com.au/host-protection-insurance) covers hosts for liability claims of up to $1 million that occur during an Airbnb stay.
1.3.4. Pro: Many hosts have ['horror' stories](http://www.airbnbhell.com/) about past Airbnb guests.
1.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Some guests use their Airbnbs as [party houses](https://www.airbnbhell.com/airbnb-party-house-keeps-getting-worse-neighbors/) which causes great disruption to their neighbours.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Many hosts find their property damaged after guests stay.
1.3.4.3.1. Con: This is not unique to AirBnB. Many hotels/guesthouses/hostels etc. also encounter property damage.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: A man [found](https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/31/another-airbnb-victim-tells-his-story-there-were-meth-pipes-everywhere/) that his home was littered with meth pipes and damage was done to the house.
1.3.4.3.3. Pro: A woman [found](http://www.zdnet.com/article/reality-hits-airbnb-after-users-home-is-vandalized-trashed/) her home trashed and vandalised.
1.3.4.3.3.1. Pro: The [host](http://www.zdnet.com/article/reality-hits-airbnb-after-users-home-is-vandalized-trashed/) found that her locked cupboard door broken into. Her cash, passport, credit cards, camera, Ipod and laptop were taken. Her clothes worn and drawers rifled through.
1.3.4.3.4. Pro: Some guests cause great [damage](https://www.airbnbhell.com/house-completely-destroyed-airbnb-guests/) to property and don't meet with the owner at the end of the trip because they don't want to be held accountable for the damage.
1.3.4.4. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.3.4.5. Con: These stories are anomalies and should not dictate whether Airbnb should exist or not.
1.3.4.6. Pro: Many [prostitutes and brothel owners](http://nypost.com/2014/04/14/hookers-using-airbnb-to-use-apartments-for-sex-sessions/) have used Airbnb as a cheap hotel to take customers to.
1.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.
1.3.6. Pro: Airbnb puts people at risk of undertaking illegal activities by failing to notify hosts of the relevant laws.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Some people are using the services to run commercial businesses by hosting multiple locations. This commercialisation runs counter to the image of Airbnb as a service run by locals to make a bit of money on the side. It is in effect the same as running a hotel business, but without the regulation.
1.3.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.5.7.
1.3.6.1.2. Con: The success of Airbnb demonstrates that hotel regulations are unnecessary to ensuring a good customer experience.
1.3.6.1.2.1. Con: If a regulation has been deemed necessary for the hotel industry by the democratic process, these regulations should also extend to hotel-like businesses.
1.3.6.1.2.2. Con: Operating a hotel-like business has allowed de facto hotel owners to skirt hard-earned [anti-discrimination laws](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/06/airbnb-racism-civil-rights-laws-sharing-economy) from the civil rights era.
1.3.6.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.7.
1.3.6.1.2.3. Con: On the contrary, this success shows that these laws are especially necessary, since people will not adhere to them unless forced to.
1.3.6.1.2.4. Con: Health and safety regulations are necessary to ensure the safety of residents.
1.3.6.1.2.4.1. Con: Whatever health and safety regulations apply to the actual residents of a property should be equally sufficient for their Airbnb guests.
1.3.6.1.2.4.1.1. Pro: There is a requirement that local addresses in New York City renting out properties [comply](http://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2013/02/for-airbnb-rental-nyc-tenant-fined-30k.html) with fire codes to ensure the safety of residents.
1.3.6.1.2.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.3.6.1.2.4.2. Pro: Hotels have fire safety and other emergency plans to help guests. Airbnb does not require hosts to come up with fire safety plans or other emergency plans.
1.3.6.1.2.4.3. Pro: Hotels provide access to safe-deposit boxes, store luggage securely and have security measures to help keep guests safe. Airbnb does not offer any of these services.
1.3.6.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: If guests use these safe-deposit boxes and luggage stores, the hotel is [liable](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/general-business-law/gbs-sect-200.html) for up to $1500 if items in these boxes or stores are stolen.
1.3.6.1.2.4.4. Pro: Hotels are required to have working fire detectors, fire doors and sprinkler systems to limit exposure of fire in the event of an emergency. Not all residential apartment blocks have such features.
1.3.6.1.2.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.3.6.1.3. Con: Even if Airbnb is predominantly run by commercial businesses, New York banned the entire service rather than specifically targeting commercial entities.
1.3.6.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.5.7.5.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Airbnb's failure to provide legal information in its [terms and conditions](https://www.airbnb.com/terms/) leaves hosts vulnerable to infringements of the law.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: For example, Nigel Warren [accrued](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/your-money/a-warning-for-airbnb-hosts-who-may-be-breaking-the-law.html?pagewanted=all) $40,000 worth of fines due to failure to comply with the laws in New York City.
1.3.6.2.2. Pro: In clause 18 in its [terms and conditions](https://www.airbnb.com/terms/), Airbnb indemnifies itself against users who break laws while using the service. This is a shirking of responsibility.
1.3.6.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.
1.3.6.2.4. Pro: Some tenants [risk eviction](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/tribeca-artist-evicted-airbnb-deals-article-1.1823280) from their landlords for renting out properties using Airbnb in breach of their tenancy agreements.
1.3.6.2.4.1. Con: It is the legal responsibility of tenants, not Airbnb, to ensure that they abide by the terms of their lease.
1.3.6.2.5. Con: The onus is on users not to break local laws. We do not hold other companies to this same standard of mandatory disclosure.
1.3.6.2.5.1. Con: Airbnb tacitly supports illegal activity by [taking a cut](https://www.airbnb.com.au/help/article/1857/what-are-airbnb-service-fees?topic=250) of the of host revenue and service fees from guests. They are therefore partially responsible for the illegal activities of those who list on the service.
1.3.6.2.5.2. Pro: Airbnb [settled](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbnb-new-york/airbnb-new-york-city-settle-rental-law-lawsuit-idUSKBN13S03U) a lawsuit against Airbnb in December 2016, by confirming that the law applied to individual renters and not third party hosts like Airbnb.
1.3.6.2.5.3. Pro: For example, car manufacturers and salespeople are not obliged to disclose the local road rules to buyers.
1.3.6.2.5.4. Pro: By agreeing to Airbnb's [Terms of Service](https://www.airbnb.ie/terms), hosts enter into a legally binding contract that "hosts alone are responsible for identifying, understanding, and complying with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to their Listings and Host Services".
1.3.6.3. Pro: The [New York State Multiple Dwelling Law](http://tenant.net/Other_Laws/MDL/mdl.html) prescribes that unhosted rentals of less than 30 days in dwellings with three or more units is unlawful and that [a fine](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/overview-airbnb-law-new-york-city.html) of $2,500 per day applies.
1.3.6.4. Pro: New York State introduced fines on the individual for [listing](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/local_laws/ch396_2016_nys.pdf) short term leases on Airbnb and similar services. It is $1,000 for first time listed, $5,000 for the second and $7,500 for the third.
1.3.6.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.5.2.
1.3.6.5. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.5.4.
1.3.6.6. Con: These are things that can be elaborated upon in their terms of service. Not being specific enough about regulations is a reason to improve upon Airbnb rather than ban it all together.
1.3.6.6.1. Con: There is no reason to necessarily believe that Airbnb can ever be regulated in a way that doesn't allow it to warp the availability of residential leases in New York City.
1.3.6.7. Pro: Between 2010 to 2014 the New York State Attorney General [reported](https://ag.ny.gov/pdfs/AIRBNB%20REPORT.pdf) that 72% of short rentals were against the Multiple Dwelling Law or the New York City Administrative Code.
1.3.7. Con: All the risks that Airbnb guests pose to the community are also posed by local residents of that community.
1.3.7.1. Con: Visitors to an area are less likely to show the same respect or admiration to that area as the daily inhabitants of that area. When their visit is over, they get to leave whereas the inhabitants have to continue to live there.
1.3.7.2. Pro: A comparison between crime rates and tourism rates in Hawaii [found little match between the trends](https://ag.hawaii.gov/cpja/files/2013/01/Crime-and-Tourism-2004.pdf), and even a moderate or strong negative correlation in half of the areas studied.
1.3.7.3. Pro: If Airbnb guests just fill rooms that would otherwise be rented in the normal fashion there is no increase in harm. It is only if Airbnb guests are more likely to commit crimes than standard tenants that any additional harms accrue.
1.3.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.4.2.
1.3.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.4.1.
1.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.4.2.
1.3.9. Pro: There is a greater likelihood that those renting short term will damage property than there is for long-term tenants.
1.3.9.1. Con: On Airbnb, this cannot happen repeatedly for guests get reviews from hosts too and these incidents would appear on their profiles.
1.3.9.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.3.9.3. Pro: There are [reports](http://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2013/06/top-5-airbnb-home-rental-horror-stories.html) of home-rental horror stories that have seen homes trashed and vandalised by Airbnb guests.
1.3.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.2.
1.3.9.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.3.
1.3.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.3.4.
1.3.9.5. Con: Owners are able to charge tenants for damage to the property through Airbnb, by claiming money from their [deposit](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/264/what-do-i-do-if-my-guest-breaks-something-in-my-place).
1.3.9.6. Con: Rowdy neighbours are also a risk - and may be worse - in residential areas of exclusively long-term tenants.
1.3.9.6.1. Pro: Rowdy long-term tenants necessarily constitute a longer-term nuisance individually than temporary tenants of Airbnb listings.
1.3.9.6.1.1. Con: A landlord is more likely to deal with rowdy long-term tenants through warnings or penalties than they are with tourists from whom they wish to receive positive reviews online.
1.3.9.7. Con: The owners of the property are aware that this is a risk before they choose to let the property.
1.3.9.8. Pro: People staying in the apartments long term will have to live with the damage to the apartment for longer which is an incentive for them to be more careful with the property.
1.3.10. Pro: Airbnb listings are not currently vetted before being put on the website and may be unsafe or otherwise unsuitable.
1.3.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.3.10.2. Con: There are provisions in place to protect Airbnb's guests.
1.3.10.2.1. Pro: Guests are entitled to a [refund](https://www.airbnb.ie/help/article/544/what-is-airbnb-s-guest-refund-policy) or alternative accommodation if the property is not up to standard upon their arrival.
1.3.10.2.1.1. Con: Generally, guests must provide photo evidence of the unsuitability of the accommodation in order to be entitled to thus. Bad odors and loud noise cannot be documented by photographic evidence.
1.3.10.2.2. Pro: The ability for tenants to review properties they have stayed in means that other people will be able to see when properties are not up to standard.
1.3.10.2.2.1. Con: This is only possible once at least one tenant has stayed in the possibly sub-standard property.
1.3.10.2.2.1.1. Con: Airbnb has [extended](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/27/airbnb-agrees-reviews-loophole-intervention-cma-regulator) their review system to allow guests who 'cancel' their Airbnb upon arrival \(after finding the conditions below standard or falsely advertised\) to leave a review.
1.3.10.2.2.1.2. Con: Guests are unlikely to be the first to rent a property because there will be no reviews. Only guest who are willing to accept this risk when choosing an apartment that is yet to be reviewed will be caught out.
1.3.10.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.3.10.4. Con: Airbnb relies on the establishment of "a trusted marketplace, through engagement and community \(P2P\)" \([Oskam and Boswijk](http://emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/JTF-11-2015-0048), pg 26\).
1.3.10.4.1. Pro: People have trust enabling them to use the platform because of the ability to review the experiences of other users.
1.3.10.4.2. Pro: It is within the interests of hosts, as well as the platform, to encourage engagement and community through reviews, describing the location to maintain this trusted marketplace.
1.3.10.4.3. Con: It is remarked in a [study](http://tomslee.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/2013-09-23_reputation_systems.pdf) that most users are rated generally 4.5 to 5 out of a scale of 5, meaning there is little discriminating between good hosts and less good hosts \(pg 7\).
1.3.10.4.3.1. Con: Hosts could be highly related because they as a whole do provide a very effective service that satisfies customers.
1.3.10.4.3.2. Con: There is probably an implicit or explicit selection bias here, where hosts \(like Uber drivers\) who cannot maintain a good rating are unable to use the service or find that they no get bookings and leave.
1.3.10.4.3.3. Pro: In [comparison](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2554500), the average ranking of Tripadvisor is 3.8 versus 4.5 for Airbnb \(Zervas and Proscerpio pg 8\).
1.3.10.4.4. Pro: The importance of this is central to the business model of Airbnb. It even [describes](https://www.airbnb.com.au/about/about-us) itself as "a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world".
1.3.10.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.10.2.2.1.1.
1.3.10.5. Con: Airbnb is planning to launch a new project called [Select](https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/13/airbnb-select-vetted-homes-2018-limited-launch/) which lists vetted homes.
1.3.10.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.1.2.4.
1.3.11. Pro: Airbnb operates in residential areas, listing many apartments of which the neighbours are permanent residents. This means travellers risk impinging on the lives of residents.
1.3.11.1. Pro: In community dwelling such as apartments, there are common areas such as lobbies or hallways controlled by a collective of owners who pay for the maintenance and upkeep. Despite this control, the owners are unable to impose rules preventing people living in apartments from renting out their properties on short-term leases. As such, the government must step in to regulate this space as private means are unavaliable.
1.3.11.2. Pro: Some Airbnb tenants will be rowdy, threatening their neighbouring residents' rights to peace and quiet enjoyment of their home.
1.3.11.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.3.11.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.9.6.
1.3.12. Pro: More Airbnb usage necessarily increases the number of unfamiliar faces in a given neighbourhood, leading to overall less cohesive neighbourhoods. Research shows that such diminished social cohesion leads to [higher crime rates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9252316).
1.3.12.1. Con: In any dense residential setting, such as New York, the number of unfamiliar faces within a given area is going to far outweigh the familiar in any circumstance anyway.
1.3.12.2. Pro: If only one apartment in a building has a high turnover rate of short-term tenants, this makes it more difficult to identify people who illegitimately entered the building, such as burglars.
1.3.12.3. Pro: Social cohesion and trust are important factors in whether people are willing to intervene on behalf of their neighbours.
1.4. Con: Airbnb creates additional supply within the housing and accommodation market that would be otherwise unavailable.
1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.5.
1.4.2. Con: Airbnb has commissioned and published studies in 3 different cities where Airbnb presence is perceived as very significant \([Berlin](https://berlin.airbnbcitizen.com/new-study-airbnb-has-no-significant-impact-on-berlin-housing-market/), [New Orleans](https://new-orleans.airbnbcitizen.com/report-airbnb-has-no-discernible-impact-on-rental-prices-in-new-orleans/) and [Portland](https://portland.airbnbcitizen.com/new-study-airbnb-listings-minimal-impact-portlands-housing-affordability-crisis/)\), arguing that its listings account for too few housing units to significantly affect rents or overall supply.
1.4.2.1. Con: This study consider cities as a whole without considering their subdivision. Touristic areas are specially impacted, while off-center areas are less impacted.
1.4.2.2. Con: These places [do not compare](http://www.businessinsider.com/statistics-data-airbnb-rent-prices-2016-10?IR=T) to New York which, like London and San Francisco, is struggling with housing crises and significantly higher rent prices.
1.4.3. Pro: Airbnb increases supply by allowing tenants to make productive use of a home they are not always occupying. This leads to a greater amount of housing stock to be available at any given time; easing the pressure on other sources.
1.4.3.1. Pro: There are plenty of reasons why someone's apartment would be entirely unoccupied for a few days or even a month, such as going on a work or holiday trip or staying at a partner's house.
1.4.3.2. Pro: The ability of standard tenants or homeowners to sublease is limited by their lack of trust in the potential tenants and the risks of doing so with a traditional subleasing arrangement. AirBnB ameliorates both of those concerns.
1.4.3.3. Pro: Housing stock is to an extent substitutable: people tradeoff renting vs owning; property can choose between short- and long-term leasing; and hotels often offer lease-like arrangements. Increasing the supply of housing in one area can thus affect all others.
1.4.4. Pro: Airbnb increases supply by allowing property owners to leverage otherwise necessary gaps in tenancies, such as when it is waiting to be sold, renovated, or leased on a long term basis.
1.4.5. Pro: Having a more flexible supply of housing \(i.e. when hosts will often opt in and out of offering their places on Airbnb\) allows the housing market to be more elastic as additional supply can be added to meet periods of high demand.
1.4.5.1. Pro: AirBnB allows for hosts to take advantage of 'peak' seasons where people are looking for places to rent in the short or medium term. By being able to charge a premium for those times it acts to reduce the shortages causes by these demand spikes.
1.4.5.2. Pro: AirBnB hosts might be unwilling to rent their property generally, but open to doing so if the price of doing so is particularly high. This ability to easy start/stop subletting is relatively unique to AirBnB and creates supply that other means cannot easily capture.
1.5. Con: Individuals are entitled to use their private property for whatever purpose they want. Airbnb is merely facilitating fulfilment of this right.
1.5.1. Pro: Property owners are entitled to invite people onto their land or exclude them. This would extend to allowing people to stay for a short term tenancy.
1.5.2. Pro: The US government may only take away property from an individual under the [Fifth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment) to the Constitution if 'just compensation' is awarded. This recognises that private rights to ownership exist as part of a legal framework that lies outside the Constitution.
1.5.2.1. Con: This provision does not remove the rights of government to regulate and impose laws governing use of private property.
1.5.2.2. Pro: This means that the government cannot seize or confiscate property at whim.
1.5.3. Con: The rights to use land are limited by other rules such as actionable in the tort of nuisance if the land affects and harms the land of another.
1.5.4. Con: Units that are full-time Airbnb deny neighborhoods the involvement of residents in their community—when renters are owners occupy the units they can engage in volunteering, participate in neighborhood planning, and connect with neighbors. Short term stay renters have no sense of connection to community, no reason to engage in long-term planning for the place, etc.
1.5.5. Con: The government of NYC has a duty to improve society, and to prevent the decisions of individuals from causing serious harm to others, even if it means curbing the liberties of others.
1.5.5.1. Con: Governments have a duty to represent citizens' views and desires and the community does not want Airbnb to be prohibited.
1.5.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.5.5.1.2. Pro: A recent Nielsen global survey found that [over two thirds](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-burbank/the-rise-of-the-sharing-e_b_5454710.html) of respondents said they would both share their assets for financial gain, and rent products/services from others in a share community. This suggests that the majority of people believe that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages of a service that functions via the sharing economy, and support its continued existence.
1.5.5.1.3. Con: The representatives that make the laws in NYC were democratically elected by their constituents and enact laws that reflect their desires.
1.5.5.1.4. Pro: Airbnb hosts in New York are extremely supportive of the service, going as far as to set up [websites](https://new-york-state.airbnbcitizen.com/) to express that support.
1.5.5.1.5. Con: The fact that NYC residents want Airbnb to stay is not a reason to keep Airbnb, especially when this desire does not outweigh the damage it can do.
1.5.5.1.6. Con: Laws and regulations cannot be decided according to the will of a proportion of the general population, but rather by elected bodies and officials who have been chosen for this very purpose based on their knowledge base and understanding of policy implications.
1.5.5.1.7. Pro: Banning Airbnb does not put consumer interests at the forefront, for it would reduce people's freedoms and decrease the ability to meet consumers' needs.
1.5.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.
1.5.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.
1.5.6. Con: Property rights are not unlimited, but rather subject to restrictions and regulations of the government such as zoning codes.
1.5.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.2.1.
1.5.6.2. Pro: The state doesn't allow individuals to carry out other illegal activities in their homes, even if the individuals own those homes.
1.5.7. Pro: Airbnb's services enable the previously-difficult opportunity for homeowners and tenants to employ their property rights to generate income.
1.5.7.1. Pro: Cities such as New York have incredibly high rent costs; [rent](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/what-is-the-cost-of-living-in-new-york-city) is on average $1,638 for a 2-bedroom apartment, and can be as high as $3,895 for the same depending on location. Renting out rooms, or their entire apartment while they are away, will be a vital/much-needed source of supplementary income for some New York residents.
1.5.7.1.1. Pro: Individual accounts such as [this](http://observer.com/2014/03/airbnb-and-the-question-of-affordable-housing-is-the-service-friend-or-foe-to-cash-strapped-new-yorkers/) detail how vital Airbnb hosting can be for New York residents who find themselves in difficult financial situations, occasionally triggered by circumstances even more uncontrollable than high rent costs.
1.5.7.2. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.5.7.
1.5.8. Pro: In the US, [private property rights](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/property/) are protected through a system of ownership, which grants owners the rights to use, occupy and transfer property as they wish.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.
1.7. Con: Airbnb contributes greatly to economic activity in New York City.
1.7.1. Pro: Airbnb has generated significant additional income that has helped to grow the NYC economy.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Tourists using Airbnb spend on average [$880 at NYC businesses](https://blog.atairbnb.com/economic-impact-airbnb/), compared to $690 for the average New York visitor.
1.7.1.2. Pro: In 2013, Airbnb provided $632 million in [economic activity](https://www.hraadvisors.com/portfolio/economic-impacts-of-airbnb/) in New York, and helped support 4580 jobs in the city.
1.7.1.3. Pro: In 2014, Airbnb [generated](https://www.airbnb.com/press/news/airbnb-community-tops-1-15-billion-in-economic-activity-in-new-york-city) $1.5 billon in economic activity in New York. This is a positive development for the city, rather than an economic consequence.
1.7.2. Pro: A lot of this economic activity is [new](https://www.hraadvisors.com/portfolio/economic-impacts-of-airbnb/) and would not have existed in the city without Airbnb.
1.7.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.4.1.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Some people choose to [stay longer](http://www.ryerson.ca/news-events/news/2016/10/why-tourists-choose-airbnb-over-hotels/) than they otherwise would because Airbnb makes their travels more affordable. These people likely spend more money in the local area because of their longer stay.
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.1.
1.7.2.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.7.2.2.3. Pro: The money they spend in the local area is also taxed which makes up for any taxes lost from hotel industry.
1.7.2.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.7.2.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.2.2.
1.7.3. Con: Governments are losing out on tax they would have received if the income was coming from the regulated hotel industry, which could have been spent on local community and infrastructure development.
1.7.3.1. Con: In 2016, Airbnb released a [“Community Compact"](https://www.airbnbaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Airbnb-Community-Compact.pdf) pledge to embrace transparency, work with cities, and take concerns over multi-unit hosts and tax issues more seriously.
1.7.3.1.1. Pro: Airbnb has taken a more proactive approach to [facilitating](https://www.airbnb.com.au/help/article/654/what-is-occupancy-tax--do-i-need-to-collect-or-pay-it) the payment of taxes, by sometimes having direct arrangements with particular locations to deduct this amount from the host's account as a matter of course.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Pro: Airbnb are trying to set up this [arrangement](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/jul/08/airbnb-legal-troubles-what-are-the-issues) in New York.
1.7.3.1.1.1.1. Pro: Airbnb have offered to begin collecting taxes from hosts for New York City and State, with the Airbnb head of global public policy estimating that the company could contribute [$65 million](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2015/02/airbnb_hotel_taxes_why_does_the_sharing_economy_startup_want_to_pay_them.html) in additional revenue.
1.7.3.2. Con: Harsher regulations would see a decrease in Airbnb economic activity, meaning the amount of tax that there would be to collect would be significantly less.
1.7.3.3. Con: Real Estate tax constituted the [top source](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/is-overdevelopment-still-a-threat/) of New York City revenue from 1992 to 2006 \(Spinola\), and continues to be a huge contributor. This tax is not likely to be greatly affected by the shift in the lodging market from hotels to Airbnb listings.
1.7.3.4. Pro: All hotel and lodging businesses are legally required to pay various taxes, whereas certain Airbnb hosts are not.
1.7.3.4.1. Pro: A host is not legally considered a hotel owner if a room of their house is only rented for [up to 14 days](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-issues-when-renting-your-home-airbnb-vrbo.html) per year \(or is only rented once or twice during any four consecutive tax quarters of a 12-month filing period\). Thus Airbnb hosts could rent out a room in their house for 14 days or less per year, and not be liable to pay income tax for this.
1.7.3.4.2. Pro: In areas where full-unit short-term-stay rentals are allowed, a full-unit host is [not legally considered](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs_and_bulls/tg_bulletins/st/hotel_and_motel_occupancy.htm) a hotel owner as long as no housekeeping services, food services, or other common hotel services are provided. Thus Airbnb hosts in such areas could rent out full-units \(for 14 days or less per year\), and not be liable to pay income tax for this.
1.7.3.4.3. Pro: An Airbnb host is not legally considered self-employed or a business owner if their net earnings from their rental do not exceed $400, so can be [exempt](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/business-taxes) from the federal income and self-employment taxes that independent hotel or B&B owners must pay.
1.7.3.4.4. Con: The only instances in which Airbnb hosts are legally exempt from paying the taxes hotel and lodging businesses must pay on their revenue are ones in which the host receives earnings too insignificant and paying-guests too rarely to be taxed on their income. Tax-free hosting will thus only comprise a very small fraction of the total listings on Airbnb.
1.7.3.4.4.1. Con: New York City and State impose multiple [taxes](https://www.airbnb.ie/help/article/868/new-york--ny) that Airbnb guests - all those who rent apartments short-term - are liable to pay. These taxes are not, however, collected by all Airbnb hosts.
1.7.3.4.4.1.1. Pro: In its online [Help](https://www.airbnb.com.au/help/article/868/new-york--ny) section, Airbnb merely points hosts in the direction of New York City and State websites concerning taxes that they may have to collect or pay on rentals. This lack of detailed information about the considerably complex tax laws surrounding short-term accommodation leads to many Airbnb hosts failing to comply with them.
1.7.3.4.4.1.1.1. Con: Airbnb has done its job insofar as it notified users of the relevant taxes and laws. It is then up to the users to be responsible for paying those taxes and the NYC government to make their websites more user friendly.
1.7.3.4.4.1.2. Pro: If a traveller stays in a listing that is considered a hotel under state law, Hotel Room Occupancy Tax \(or Hotel Tax\) applies and is [5.875%](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/business-hotel-room-occupancy-tax.page) per room per night. Through ignorance of the fact that they are legally considered to own a hotel, or through reluctance to tax their rent charge, many Airbnb hosts do not collect this tax.
1.7.3.4.4.1.3. Pro: The New York State Attorney General [reported](https://ag.ny.gov/pdfs/AIRBNB%20REPORT.pdf) that during the period under review \(2010 to 2014\) [$110 million](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/airbnb-tax-revenue-loss-states/) in unpaid taxes relating to occupancy were not collected.
1.7.3.4.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.7.3.1.1.
1.7.3.4.4.1.5. Pro: If a traveller stays in a listing that is considered a hotel under state law, they must pay a Hotel Room Occupancy Fee of [$1.50](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs_and_bulls/tg_bulletins/st/hotel_and_motel_occupancy.htm) per day per unit. Through ignorance of the fact that they are legally considered to own a hotel, or through reluctance to collect this supplementary fee, many Airbnb hosts do not collect it.
1.7.3.4.4.1.6. Pro: New York City also charge a flat-rate Bed Tax of [$2 per room](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/business/07taxes.html) to travellers staying in a listing that is considered a hotel under state law. Through ignorance of the fact that they are legally considered to own a hotel, or through reluctance to tax their rent charge, many New York City Airbnb hosts do not collect this tax.
1.7.3.4.4.1.7. Pro: If a traveller stays in a listing located in New York City that is considered a hotel under state law, a combined city and state sales tax of [8.875%](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/business-nys-sales-tax.page) applies to the rent charge. Since taxes for visitors to New York City are ranked [second](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/business/07taxes.html) highest in the USA, many Airbnb hosts may neglect to collect this tax so as not to deter guests.
1.7.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.4.4.1.3.
1.7.3.6. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.4.4.1.
1.7.3.7. Con: Tax laws that do not take into account obstacles for internet-era companies mean that it has sometimes been difficult for Airbnb to collect and remit taxes in the past.
1.7.3.7.1. Pro: In 2014, Airbnb stated that it could not collect and remit occupancy taxes to New York City and State under the [“current tax law.”](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2015/02/airbnb_hotel_taxes_why_does_the_sharing_economy_startup_want_to_pay_them.html)
1.7.3.8. Con: The government are more likely to receive tax from Airbnb lets if they make short-term Airbnb listings legal. People have a disincentive to pay tax on their currently illegal short-term lettings, as they do not want to be caught.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.3.
1.7.5. Pro: The money that guests save by renting an Airbnb for their trips is likely to then be spent on a diverse range of smaller local businesses, such as restaurants or shops in the vicinity of their accommodation, whereas previously that money would likely have gone to a hotel conglomerate.
1.7.6. Pro: Airbnb economic contribution is especially beneficial in parts of the city where hotels are not allowed, enabling those communities to benefit financially from tourism as well \([Coles et al, p. 2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3048397)\).
1.7.6.1. Pro: [More than 80 percent](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/press/news/airbnb-community-tops-1-15-billion-in-economic-activity-in-new-york-city) of Airbnb properties in New York are outside of traditional hotel districts, bringing dollars to neighborhoods that have not benefitted from tourism in the past.
1.8. Pro: Airbnb has increased the price of rent in NYC and in doing so aggravated the existing shortage of affordable housing.
1.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.1.
1.8.2. Con: Housing shortages and unaffordable housing prices in NYC are caused primarily by over-regulation, not Airbnb.
1.8.2.1. Con: Regulations such as [rent stabilisation](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/08/17/tenants-under-siege-inside-new-york-city-housing-crisis/) were crucial to providing a sufficient amount of affordable housing in New York. The deregulation of these apartments is an important cause of the current housing crisis.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: Between 2007 and 2014, 25% of the rent-stabilized apartments on the [Upper West Side of Manhattan](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/08/17/tenants-under-siege-inside-new-york-city-housing-crisis/) were deregulated.
1.8.2.1.2. Pro: Landlords have been reported to pressure and [harass tenants](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/08/17/tenants-under-siege-inside-new-york-city-housing-crisis/) with legal rights to lower rents, trying to compel them to move out in order to raise rents. More efficient pro-tenant regulation could combat this phenomenon.
1.8.2.2. Con: The problem isn't too much regulation, but that existing regulations aren't implemented strictly enough, are badly written or not expansive enough.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: A lot of affordable housing in New York is tailored to help people with incomes [far above the poverty line](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/08/17/tenants-under-siege-inside-new-york-city-housing-crisis/), failing to address the needs of the city's poorest inhabitants.
1.8.2.2.2. Pro: The massive [potential profits](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/08/17/tenants-under-siege-inside-new-york-city-housing-crisis/) from renting to the highest possible tier of the New York market are a powerful incentive for real estate developers to avoid regulations using every possible legal loophole, so the problem isn't over-, but underregulation.
1.8.2.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.1.2.
1.8.2.3. Pro: [Zoning rules](https://blog.oup.com/2016/09/new-york-housing-crisis/) in New York City limit the amount of supply that can be made available, which raises the prices of the available supply.
1.8.2.3.1. Pro: Zoning rules in NYC place a limit on how much housing can be built per square foot of lot, a ratio that changes per neighborhood. As these were [introduced in 1961](https://blog.oup.com/2016/09/new-york-housing-crisis/), they are severely outdated and do not reflect NYC's current population needs.
1.8.2.3.2. Pro: Restrictive zoning limits the supply of housing, leading to housing prices that are as much as [double](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=penniur_papers) the cost of construction.
1.8.2.4. Pro: Rent-controlled and rent-stabilised apartments in New York City have an adverse effect on the supply and price distribution of apartments.
1.8.2.4.1. Pro: Those who are lucky enough to have rent-controlled apartments \(i.e. cheap accommodation\) would never want to give their apartments up, meaning these affordable places never come on to the market.
1.8.2.4.1.1. Pro: [Most government housing programs](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/magazine/the-perverse-effects-of-rent-regulation.html) tie their support to an apartment unit, rather than to a person. This means there is no incentive to leave these apartments, even if they stop being suitable for the people living there, as there is nowhere else to move to that they can afford.
1.8.2.4.1.2. Pro: Rent control was given to apartments where the people has been living continuously since 1971. [The only way to get one](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/8/28/16214506/nyc-apartments-housing-rent-control), therefore, is to be lucky enough to be related to someone who was living in one of these houses for that long, for these apartments just get passed down through the family.
1.8.2.4.1.3. Pro: This means younger generations are unable to join the housing market, as affordable places are dominated by the older generation who have been in these homes for a long time.
1.8.2.4.1.3.1. Pro: [Over 23%](http://furmancenter.org/files/publications/HVS_Rent_Stabilization_fact_sheet_FINAL_4.pdf) of rent-stabilised households are led by someone over 65, compared to 7% of market-rate households.
1.8.2.4.1.4. Pro: Aroung 23% of households in rent-stabilised apartments have lived in their unit [for 20 years or more](http://furmancenter.org/files/publications/HVS_Rent_Stabilization_fact_sheet_FINAL_4.pdf), compared with only 7% of households living in market-rate units. In Manhattan below 96th St, it is as high as 35% compared to 2.7% or market-rate households.
1.8.2.4.2. Con: [Rent-controls](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/magazine/the-perverse-effects-of-rent-regulation.html) in NYC are there to ensure that the poor are not completely pushed out of the city. Without them, cheap apartments would become expensive apartments as soon as they hit the market. Rent-controls are therefore better than the status quo.
1.8.2.4.3. Pro: [Roughly half](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/magazine/the-perverse-effects-of-rent-regulation.html) the apartments in New York city are under rent regulation, public housing or a government program, meaning everyone else has to compete for the places with market-determined rent prices, thereby limiting the supply available.
1.8.2.4.4. Con: [Only 1%](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/8/28/16214506/nyc-apartments-housing-rent-control) of NYC's apartments are rent controlled.
1.8.2.4.4.1. Con: [Yet 50%](https://ny.curbed.com/2017/8/28/16214506/nyc-apartments-housing-rent-control) of the city's apartments are rent-stabilised or on government programs, both of which have the same effects on the market.
1.8.2.5. Pro: Property tax rates in New York City are [exceptionally high](http://www.businessinsider.com/if-you-live-in-new-york-and-you-rent-youre-paying-a-huge-tax-you-dont-even-know-about-2013-6?IR=T), which brings up the price of rentals.
1.8.2.5.1. Con: [Average property tax](https://smartasset.com/taxes/new-york-property-tax-calculator) in New York City, at 0.72% is actually lower than the average across the state, which is at 1.5%.
1.8.2.5.1.1. Con: These low property taxes apply to owner-occupied homes only; the rate on apartment buildings, which are most likely to be rented out, is [closer to 4%](http://www.businessinsider.com/if-you-live-in-new-york-and-you-rent-youre-paying-a-huge-tax-you-dont-even-know-about-2013-6?IR=T).
1.8.2.6. Con: Even if the regulations in NYC are largely to blame for the high housing prices, the addition of Airbnb makes things worse, not better.
1.8.2.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.5.
1.8.2.6.2. Pro: A [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3006832) in the US has shown that Airbnb drives rental prices up. It finds that a 10% increase in Airbnb listings leads to a 0.42% increase in rents and a 0.76% increase in house prices.
1.8.2.7. Pro: NYC courts have been accused of having a [tenant-friendly bias](https://www.wsj.com/articles/landlords-claim-court-bias-in-favor-of-tenants-1419904903), costing landlords significantly if they happen to get a bad tenant. Landlords are therefore likely to react by asking for larger deposits or higher rent prices to make up for the risk of taking on a bad tenant.
1.8.3. Pro: Housing prices in areas where Airbnb is in use are likely to rise, given that people are willing to pay more for a property in the knowledge that they can use short-term leasing to bring in more revenue in the future.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.6.2.
1.8.5. Con: Rent prices are in constant, natural fluctuation due to a variety of factors. Prohibiting Airbnb would therefore have little effect on the overall, long-term nature of the supply and demand \(and thus prices\) of rented housing.
1.8.5.1. Pro: It is not just Airbnb short-term letting that affects rent prices: employment rates, buying prices, growing industries in particular locations and immigration are but some of the many variables that can also have substantial influence on them.
1.8.5.2. Con: Even if Airbnb had little effect on the overall long-term trends in rent prices, short-term spikes could still have a potentially disastrous effect for any tenant whose contract allowed their landlord to adjust their rent during their tenancy.
1.8.5.3. Con: Just because rent prices fluctuate naturally does not mean that Airbnb does not have an effect on them, skewing the direction in which they fluctuate.
1.8.6. Con: NYC has had an affordable housing crisis [since the 80s](http://furmancenter.org/files/publications/AHistoryofHousingPolicycombined0601_000.pdf) \(p.3\), whereas Airbnb only emerged [in 2008.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb)
1.8.7. Pro: Rent rises negatively affect diversity in the city as they narrow the demographic who can afford to live there.
1.8.8. Con: -> See 1.4.2.
1.8.9. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.5.5.
1.8.10. Con: The real problem is with the current regulations, not with Airbnb. If these are adequately changed, Airbnb's positive effects could be enhanced while minimising negative externalities.
1.8.10.1. Pro: The laws governing Airbnb in New York City are too antiquated and not well-adapted to the sharing economy.
1.8.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.3.2.2.
1.8.10.1.2. Pro: Businesses in the sharing economy have an unfair advantage, since existing regulations do not apply to them. This problem can easily be addressed by updating regulations to this new form of doing business - there is no need to ban them entirely.
1.8.10.1.2.1. Pro: For instance, the government could allow hotels to section off a part of their establishment for short-term lets at similar prices to Airbnb, while still holding all parties accountable to a limit on the amount of nights/year this service could be offered so that tax regulations are abided by.
1.8.10.1.2.2. Pro: If the government limits Airbnb hosts to a certain number of nights or properties, then they will cease to be threatening competitors for the hotels.
1.8.10.1.2.3. Pro: Homeowners on Airbnb could be required to apply for licenses from the government, to ensure that they are subject to some inspections, fees and taxes much like hotels are.
1.8.10.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.4.
1.8.10.1.4. Pro: The sharing economy is still relatively very young and government regulators haven't had time to catch up with this new way of doing business yet.
1.8.10.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.6.1.
1.8.10.1.4.2. Pro: The concept of a [sharing economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy#History) has only been around for under 20 years, only really taking flight in the last 5 years. As such, laws have not had the chance to adapt to this new way of doing business yet.
1.8.10.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.5.
1.8.10.2. Pro: The method of regulating and imposing financial sanctions on individuals is highly punitive.
1.8.10.2.1. Con: If people break the law, then punishments should by very definition be punitive.
1.8.10.2.2. Pro: The root cause of the problem is the provision of the Airbnb service. To fine users doesn't address this core issue and instead distributes punishments semi-randomly based on who is prosecuted.
1.8.10.2.3. Pro: Corporate entities have much deeper pockets than individuals. Sanctions there can actually target the root of the problem whereas targeting users only marginally reduces supply.
1.8.10.2.4. Con: We impose fines on individuals for breaking the driving speeding limit or parking without paying, for instance. There is no reason why punishing individuals financially for misusing Airbnb is any different or overly severe.
1.8.10.2.5. Pro: The current laws in New York City include penalties for listing an advertisement for short term accommodation on services such as Airbnb for units in multiple dwelling buildings. This is too harsh a law with penalties too steep for ordinary individuals.
1.8.10.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.4.
1.8.10.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.3.
1.8.10.2.6. Pro: Financial penalties should only be reserved for cases where actions have caused negative impacts for the community; the fine serves to compensate the community for the harm suffered. By listing an apartment on Airbnb, an individual does not cause any negative impacts.
1.8.10.2.6.1. Con: -> See 1.3.10.
1.8.10.2.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.8.10.2.6.3. Pro: Penalties of $7500 for a third infringement of listing an apartment for less than 30 days is disproportionate to any harm suffered.
1.8.10.2.6.4. Con: -> See 1.3.
1.8.10.2.6.5. Con: By imposing financial penalties, the government is forcing people to change their habits and sending a message that doing that conduct is unacceptable. Here it is unacceptable to breach clear laws prohibiting short leases of apartments.
1.8.10.3. Pro: Many cities allow Airbnb but impose restrictions on it. This proves it is not necessary to prohibit Airbnb in order to make it adhere to the country's laws.
1.8.10.3.1. Pro: Fines on hosts in Berlin and Santa Monica [proved particularly effective](http://blog.airdna.co/effects-airbnb-regulation/) at regulating the industry. Listings fell by 49% and 37% after fines of $100,000 and $500 respectively were introduced. This shows improved regulation can be effective, without the need to ban the service.
1.8.10.3.1.1. Con: Professional hosts in both Berlin and San Francisco, were actually [less affected](http://blog.airdna.co/effects-airbnb-regulation/) by this Airbnb regulation, as they simply readjusted their nightly prices to compensate for it. It therefore didn't cut out the people who are breaking the law.
1.8.10.3.2. Pro: [London and Amsterdam](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/03/airbnb-regulation-london-amsterdam-housing), for instance, have opted to adapt its regulations such that citizens are entitled to rent out their homes for a maximum of 60 days/year, with guests paying tourist tax. This meant it could avoid prohibiting the service outright.
1.8.10.3.3. Pro: [Los Angeles](http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/22/technology/airbnb-regulations/index.html) has proposed allowing hosts to rent their homes for up to 120 days a year, as long as the hosts live there for at least six months of the year.
1.8.10.3.4. Pro: In [Amsterdam](https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-06-22/places-with-strict-airbnb-laws/4), the owner of a house or apartment can rent it out to up to four people at a time for up to 60 days a year.
1.8.10.3.4.1. Con: The reality is that these day caps are not that effective; in [San Francisco](http://blog.airdna.co/effects-airbnb-regulation/), for instance, the policy lead to a modest 5% decrease in listings.
1.8.10.3.5. Pro: [Paris](https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-06-22/places-with-strict-airbnb-laws/5) allows hosts to rent out their apartments for up to 120 days a year.
1.8.10.3.6. Pro: [New Orleans](https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-06-22/places-with-strict-airbnb-laws/6) allows whole-home rentals to guests for up to 90 days a year.
1.8.10.3.7. Pro: In [Berlin](https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-06-22/places-with-strict-airbnb-laws/8), landlords can apply for short-term rental permits.
1.8.10.3.8. Pro: In [Reykjavik](https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-06-22/places-with-strict-airbnb-laws/3), apartments can be rented out for up to 90 days a year.
1.8.10.4. Pro: It is in the interests of cities like New York to embrace innovation, so as to keep pace with changes in the world.
1.8.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.1.
1.8.10.4.2. Pro: The sharing economy has brought significant economic growth to countries' economies. As such, it is in their interest to adapt their regulations such that companies can continue to innovate and grow, creating jobs and additional spendable income.
1.8.10.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.
1.8.10.4.3. Pro: NYC competes with other large and attractive cities for tourist revenue. Conservative lending laws will draw people away from NYC and push them to other more progressive cities.
1.8.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.1.5.
