Discussion Title: Is television bad for people?

1. Television is bad for people.
1.1. Pro: TV keeps you in a information bubble.
1.1.1. Pro: With just [6 corporations owning 90% of the media](https://www.morriscreative.com/6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america/), is highly unlikely television will broadcast an unbiased and full spectrum of information.
1.1.2. Pro: Netflix [has around](http://time.com/4272360/the-number-of-movies-on-netflix-is-dropping-fast/) 6000 shows and movies, IMDB is approaching [5 million](https://www.imdb.com/pressroom/stats/) entries. Netflix only show about 0,12% of movies \(known to IMDB\).
1.1.3. Con: TV can be used to view information from different sources. It is the viewers fault if they are kept in an "infomation bubble".
1.1.4. Con: It depends on your level of access to TV. I may only have access to basic \(free to air\) television where there are limited options. Others may have access to TV, Netflix, Stan, cable TV, international content, internet based \(etc.\) where the choices and content are much wider.
1.1.5. Con: People can choose what they want to watch

1.7. Pro: All channels have an ideological bias; thus watching TV is a form of receiving propaganda.

TV often displays images of drug-use that make it seem bad, not good.
1.8.2. Pro: Movies & Shows glorifying substance abuse lifestyle \(Narco's, Breaking Bad, Wolf of Wallstreet\) are widely known, while there is little attention for the actual damages of the opiod crisis and drug trade.
1.8.3. Pro: Research [has shown](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090303193958.htm) for the first time that portrayals of alcohol in films and TV advertisements have an immediate effect on the amount of alcohol that people drink.

1.10. Pro: TV makes people anti-social.
1.10.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.10.2. Pro: "Turning one's back on family and friends for the solace of television [may be](http://www.circuitinsight.com/programs/49747.html) maladaptive and leave a person with fewer resources over time,"
1.10.3. Pro: "Excessive hours" spent watching television in a child's youth [may be related](http://nationalpost.com/health/excessive-television-watching-linked-to-antisocial-criminal-behaviour-in-adolescents) to an increased risk of antisocial behaviour later in life.
1.10.4. Pro: Popular television shows ranging from Celebrity Big Brother to Little Britain were blamed by [members of the Church](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1544349/Blame-TV-for-moral-decline-says-Synod.html) for eroding moral standards.
1.10.4.1. Con: The Church are no longer the authority on social moral standards.

1.11.1.1. Con: The time the average American is reading is declining and is [\>20 minutes a day](https://humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=11094) compared to [\>5 hours of watching television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_consumption) the relevance of TV on influencing public opinion is much larger.
1.11.2. Pro: There are lots of examples of the use of [subliminal messaging](http://www.progressiveawareness.org/research_desk_reference/legal_status_of_subliminal_communication.html) in broadcasts.
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.1.5.

1.11.5. Pro: There’s [evidence](https://www.salon.com/2012/10/30/does_tv_actually_brainwash_americans/) to suggest that the act of watching TV makes people more passive and accepting of authority.
1.11.6. Pro: [Speculation](https://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/broadcast-national-anthem-1960s-contain-subliminal-messages/) of Subliminal Messages in the broadcast of the National Anthem in the 1960s.
1.11.7. Pro: [US PATENT 6506148 B2](http://www.collective-evolution.com/2018/02/22/us-patent-6506148-b2-confirms-human-nervous-system-manipulation-through-your-computer-tv/) Confirms human nervous system manipulation through your computer and TV.

1.11.9. Pro: The CIA has [a history](https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-cia-and-the-media-50-facts-the-world-needs-to-know/5471956) of influencing public opinion through the media, for instance with [Project Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird).
1.12. Pro: TV is addictive.
1.12.1. Con: There is little evidence Television in and of itself is addictive - as a stand alone addiction. ". . .  the mere lack of research completed deters one from achieving conceptual clarity regarding television addition. It may overlap with personality or other disorders such as histrionic or narcissistic personality disorders, or other behavioral addictions, which needs to be delineated. That is, the existence of TV addiction as a “stand-alone” phenomenon still needs investigation."[ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4114517/)
1.12.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.12.3. Pro: [Research](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/depression-loneliness-linked-to-binge-watching-television/) is showing that the habit of binge-watching is driven by the same impulse as other addictions, such as drugs and alcohol.
1.12.4. Pro: People with low levels of self-control were more likely to binge-watch. [Researchers](http://time.com/3689264/lonely-depressed-binge-watching/) said that binge-watching should no longer be seen as a “harmless addiction”
1.13. Pro: Smart TV's can be used to spy on you.
1.13.1. Pro: The CIA [Allegedly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2017/03/07/cia-wikileaks-samsung-smart-tv-hack-security/#4e14d5d74bcd) Hacked Samsung Smart TVs

1.14.1. Pro: People learn English in non-English speaking countries, such as [Finland](http://www.teachhub.com/how-television-can-actually-help-learning), by watching [American sitcoms](https://www.kaplaninternational.com/blog/friends-helps-learn-english-40) with subtitles.

1.14.4. Pro: Children who watched three or more hours a day were three months ahead of those who watched less than an hour a day, [study](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/10138281/Letting-children-watch-hours-of-TV-improves-academic-ability-study-claims.html) found

1.15.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.15.2. Pro: you can keep informed about news
1.16. Con: TV can relieve loneliness.
1.16.1. Pro: Watching television when lonely, [seems to provide](https://www.wired.com/2009/07/television-and-loneliness/) the same sort of emotional relief as spending time with real people.
1.16.2. Con: It remains an open question, [say the researchers](http://www.circuitinsight.com/programs/49747.html), whether social surrogacy suppresses belongingness needs or actually fulfills them, and they acknowledge that the kind of social surrogacy provoked by these programs can be a poor substitution for "real" human-to-human experience.
1.16.3. Pro: [A study](http://time.com/3689264/lonely-depressed-binge-watching/) has found that people who struggle with loneliness and depression are more likely to binge-watch television than their peers. The activity provides an escape from their unpleasant feelings.

1.17.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.
1.17.4. Pro: TV is [linked](https://www.parentingscience.com/effects-of-television-on-children-learning-speech.html) with slower language acquisition because TV time tends to displace conversation time between babies and adults.
1.17.5. Pro: Watching lots of TV ‘makes you stupid’, say [researchers](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/watching-lots-of-tv-makes-you-stupid-says-american-universities-a6759026.html)

1.18.2. Pro: Violence on TV [poses a threat](http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/aggr/articles/Huesmann/2006.Huesmann&Taylor.Role%20of%20Media%20Violence%20in%20Violent%20Behavior.AnnualRevPubHealth.pdf) to public health inasmuch as it leads to an increase in real-world violence and aggression.
1.18.3.

1.22.2. Con: The anti-TV groups' [critique](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jul/21/childrensservices.socialcare) of the medium is not that the stuff children watch is rubbish, but that TV viewing itself is a catastrophic lifestyle option that parents have inflicted on their children.
