Discussion Title: Is it Time for Hungary and the EU to Part Ways?

1. Hungary should leave the European Union.
1.1. Con: Leaving the EU would result in Hungarian people losing their EU citizenship, which provides important benefits for everyone.
1.1.1. Con: Free movement might be better for the individual but not for the whole country. Free movement to other countries means young people, skilled workers etc. leave Hungary for opportunities elsewhere.
1.1.1.1. Pro: Free movement fuels the rise of political ideologies like [populism and xenophobia](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/899709/european-union-hungary-prime-minister-Viktor-Orban-migration-eu).
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The citizenship goes both ways. Citizens of other EU member countries can move freely into Hungary and take Hungarian jobs.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This happens to a lesser extent as Hungary is [poorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe_by_GDP_\(nominal\)_per_capita) than other member states so there would be more opportunities in other countries.
1.1.1.1.1.2. Con: Hungary has an [exceptionally low](https://financialobserver.eu/ce/hungary/exceptionally-low-unemployment-rate-in-hungary/) unemployment rate compared to other European states.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The [unemployment rate](https://countryeconomy.com/countries/compare/france/hungary) of 3.8% is the lowest in decades, and certainly is something Orban's government can be very proud of.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Since 2013 around 20-30.000 Hungarians [emigrate every year](https://dailynewshungary.com/how-many-people-do-you-think-emigrate-from-hungary-latest-statistics/). This means a significant reduction in the labour pool, which affects society and the economy negatively.
1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Those emigrating from Hungary [disproportionately](http://hungarianspectrum.org/2015/07/02/the-growing-hungarian-emigration/) have higher levels of education.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Immigrants tend to congregate together for the simple reason that people like being around people they relate to. So areas start looking ethnically ambiguous rather than distinctly Hungarian.
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Free movement undermines the welfare state. It's [hard to know](https://www.portfolio.hu/gazdasag/ide-vezetett-a-tomeges-kivandorlas-tobb-magyar-lepett-le-mint-gondoltuk.1.260665.html) how many people will be in the country at any given time, making welfare spending difficult to calculate.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Pro: This puts states in a dangerous double bind. Either only help their citizens, making migrant workers worse off, when they take the jobs citizens wouldn't want anyway. Or they serve everyone, meaning there's less welfare for citizens, the people who pay taxes, live there and don't have the ability to leave.
1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: Welfare is based on lawful registered residence in an EU member state that falls under defined categories \("exercising treaty rights" - employment, studying, etc.\). That would mean that there is no ambiguity about the number of people who are eligible in any one state.
1.1.1.1.4. Con: These policies are equally fueled by the refugee crisis which cannot be prevented by removing Hungary's visa free travel within the EU.
1.1.1.1.4.1. Con: Without EU [quota systems](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/world/europe/eu-migrants-hungary-slovakia.html), Hungary could likely opt to accept fewer refugees, subduing the concerns of populists.
1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: In 2015, The European Commission launched an "infringement case" against Hungary over its [asylum legislation](https://www.todayonline.com/world/eu-executive-opens-case-against-hungary-over-its-asylum-law?page=1), which rejected mandatory migrant quotas.
1.1.1.1.5. Con: The [vast majority](https://www.portfolio.hu/gazdasag/ide-vezetett-a-tomeges-kivandorlas-tobb-magyar-lepett-le-mint-gondoltuk.1.260665.html) of Hungarians support free movement of labour within the EU, including Hungarian President [Viktor Orbán](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-orban/hungary-pm-warns-against-eroding-free-movement-for-eu-citizens-idUSKBN1CB0IE).
1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Statistics show that Hungary has [less net emigration](https://hungarytoday.hu/hungarian-exodus-examining-europes-falling-population-economic-perspective-33519/) than its neighbors \(including those outside the EU\).
1.1.1.1.5.1.1. Pro: The World Bank’s net migration data from [2012 shows](https://hungarytoday.hu/hungarian-exodus-examining-europes-falling-population-economic-perspective-33519/) that Romania has a net migration rate of -21.80%, Serbia -13.89%, Croatia 1.39%, and Hungary 1.33%.
1.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.5.1.
1.1.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.2. Pro: EU citizenship allows Hungarians to travel around 27 countries freely.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Since the enactment of [Directive 2004/38/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32004L0038) all member states have to ensure that there are no explicit or implicit barriers to the free movement of persons across the EU.
1.1.2.2. Con: Hungary could negotiate new visa agreements with many countries.
1.1.3. Pro: EU citizenship allows Hungarians to work in any other member state without restrictions or discrimination.
1.1.3.1. Con: Given the [large number](https://budapestbeacon.com/600000-hungarians-living-eu-countries/) of Hungarians who are already residents of other EU states, Budapest would likely be able to negotiate reasonable work visa regulations with other EU member states.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Many Hungarians](https://budapestbeacon.com/600000-hungarians-living-eu-countries/) live in other EU states making Hungarian a part of the European identity.
1.1.4. Con: No longer being a member of the EU would slow down emigration from Hungary.
1.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.
1.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.5.1.
1.1.5. Pro: EU citizenship allows Hungarians to study in any other member state without restrictions or discrimination.
1.1.5.1. Pro: While in 2016, an estimated 11,800 were studying outside Hungary, by 2017 it was around 13,300 students \(not counting those spending exchange semesters as part of Erasmus mobility programs\). Almost all of these students are studying in [EU countries](https://dailynewshungary.com/a-growing-number-of-hungarians-opt-to-study-abroad/).
1.1.5.1.1. Con: Non EU members are also in the [Erasmus](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/programme-guide/part-a/who-can-participate/eligible-countries_en) program.
1.1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.7. Con: Compared to other Europeans, [significantly fewer](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/ResultDoc/download/DocumentKy/83569) Hungarians claim to have benefitted from opportunities derived from their EU citizenship. These findings suggest that what the European Union perceives as benefits for the Hungarians is not necessarily what the majority of the Hungarian population actually needs.
1.2. Con: Leaving the EU would push Hungary closer to Putin's Russia or to China.
1.2.1. Con: Britain leaving the EU does not appear to have led to closer UK-Russia ties.
1.2.1.1. Con: The history of Hungarian-Russian relations and those between UK-Russia are too different to be directly comparable.
1.2.1.2. Con: Unlike the UK, Hungary is a relatively small country that an aggressive Russia may seek to dominate.
1.2.1.3. Con: The geographic position of Hungary puts it in a direct sphere of interest for Russian geopolitical ambitions, contrary to the further located UK.
1.2.1.4. Con: Hungary is currently seeking [closer](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/hungary-relationship-russia-send-message-eu-180919131248490.html) ties with Russia.
1.2.1.4.1. Pro: Russia and Hungary are pursuing closer energy [agreements](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/hungary-relationship-russia-send-message-eu-180919131248490.html).
1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Hungary and Russia are [planning](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungarys-foreign-minister-urges-cooperation-russia-military-technical-sphere/) to increase military cooperation with each other.
1.2.1.4.3. Pro: Bilateral trade between Hungary and Russia increased by [25%](https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/hungarys-partnership-with-russia-is-squeezing-ukraine.html) in 2017.
1.2.1.5. Con: Hungary was formerly part of the [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc) during the cold war, the UK was not.
1.2.2. Con: The Visegrad Group instead of Russia would be an alternative for Hungary. These countries could form a strong Central European bloc.
1.2.2.1. Con: The Visegrád Group are all members of the EU and NATO. It doesn't present an alternative, as much as just being a weaker version of existing alliances that Hungary is already part of.
1.2.3. Pro: China and Hungary have many overlapping incentives.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Bilateral economic and trade relations have become [increasingly close](http://www.nouvelle-europe.eu/en/hungary-flagship-china-europe) in recent years.
1.2.3.2. Con: China only views Hungary as valuable due to it being a "gateway to Europe". If Hungary left the EU it would [diminish](http://www.nouvelle-europe.eu/en/hungary-flagship-china-europe) this status.
1.2.3.3. Pro: Chinese companies have [invested](https://gbtimes.com/chinese-companies-have-more-opportunities-in-hungary-as-china-and-cee-countries-deepen-ties) significantly in Hungary in recent years.
1.2.3.3.1. Con: Chinese investment isn't in itself necessarily a benefit for the country. It can be exploitative and can increase Chinese influence over some sectors of Hungarian economy.
1.2.3.3.1.1. Pro: China has pursued [exploitative](https://www.thedailybeast.com/chinas-ugly-exploitation-of-africaand-africans) investment strategies in Africa.
1.2.3.3.1.2. Con: Chinese investment in Hungary is likely to include investment in Hungarian [infrastructure and tech](https://www.theepochtimes.com/questions-linger-in-hungary-about-chinese-investments_2668965.html).
1.2.4. Con: Russia and China are not inferior to the West by default. Only a fraction of the world’s nations can be considered [democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index). More than half, including several developed and wealthy nations, have chosen to function as hybrid or authoritarian regimes. Therefore, the prospect of Hungary coming closer to Putin’s Russia and/or China cannot in itself be a counterargument to leaving the European Union.
1.2.4.1. Con: Western Europe is a better partner than Russia.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: Western Europe has more [wealth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_and_social_rankings_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe) for FDI into Hungary.
1.2.4.1.2. Pro: Most Hungarians are [skeptical](https://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2017-7-27_hungary_poll_presentation.pdf) of Russia’s interests.
1.2.4.1.3. Pro: Due to its [massive human rights abuses](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/russia) domestically, Russia is far less likely to stand up for human rights in Hungary than Western Europe.
1.2.4.1.4. Pro: Russia has a history of backing autocratic regimes that abuse the rights of their populations in states that are within its sphere of influence.
1.2.4.1.4.1. Pro: Russia [backs](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/russia-syria-putin-assad-trump-isis-ghouta/554270/) the Assad regime in Syria which is responsible for the [mass murder](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/bashar-al-assad-a-profile-of-a-mass-murderer) of Syrians.
1.2.4.1.4.2. Pro: Russia [supported](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/russia-syria-putin-assad-trump-isis-ghouta/554270/) Ukrainian [autocrat](https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-10-19/ukraine-s-ousted-autocrat-suing-country-violating-his-human-rights) Victor Yanukovych who was [responsible](https://mic.com/articles/190642/manafort-funded-his-lavish-lifestyle-through-decades-of-work-for-corrupt-leaders-and-despots#.UfKXrwMik) for corruption and persecution of political opponents.
1.2.5. Pro: Expelling Hungary from the EU could aid in the formation of a [Euroskeptic](https://www.cfr.org/article/europe-wrestles-hungarys-populist-challenge) Eastern bloc.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Russia has been actively supporting [far-right](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/europe-s-far-right-enjoys-backing-russia-s-putin-n718926) and [Euroskeptic](http://www.gmfus.org/publications/russia-euroskeptic-parties-and-italian-elections) parties across the European Union.
1.2.5.2. Pro: This is noteworthy as Poland is currently shifting towards [authoritarianism](https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_poland_hungary_slipping_facade_of_democracy) in a similar way to Hungary.
1.2.5.2.1. Pro: [Poland's government](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-rule-of-law-suspended-from-eu-judicial-organization/) has also been at odds with the EU in recent years - if Hungary left the EU, Poland would most likely follow.
1.2.5.2.1.1. Con: Poland is massively dependent on the EU, they would not leave just because Hungary does.
1.2.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: Support for the EU is [very high](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poland-eu-membership-support-for-membership-courts-rule-of-law-mateusz-morawiecki-juncker-a8149876.html) in Poland.
1.2.5.2.1.1.2. Pro: [80%](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/poland_en) of Poland's trade is with the EU.
1.2.5.2.1.1.3. Pro: Poland receives over [€10 billion](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/poland_en) a year from the EU.
1.2.5.2.1.1.4. Con: Hungary is dependent on the EU in the exact same way as Poland and both countries' governments are currently pursuing similar political strategies.
1.2.5.2.1.1.4.1. Con: Poland is not as close with actors outside the EU, such as [Russia](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-hungary-stand-united-except-on-russia-orban-szydlo/), and thus has few viable options if it left.
1.2.5.2.1.1.4.2. Pro: Both countries face multiple EU infringement proceedings, and have repeatedly indicated that they will not take in any [asylum seekers](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-says-ecj-ruling-on-refugee-quotas-has-raped-eu-law-asylum-seekers-italy-greece-relocation-scheme/), rejecting the Commission’s quota system for migrants.
1.2.5.2.1.1.4.3. Pro: Poland, like Hungary, has been criticized for its shift towards [illiberal](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-hungary-stand-united-except-on-russia-orban-szydlo/) practices.
1.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.4.
1.3. Pro: Hungary has consistently been at odds with the EU.
1.3.1. Con: Often countries within the EU are at odds with each other over policies.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Germany is at odds with other EU states. For example, over fiscal discipline.
1.3.1.1.1. Pro: Germany has demanded Ireland raise its [corporation tax](https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/german-parties-battle-over-our-corporation-tax-29651496.html).
1.3.1.1.2. Pro: Germany argues that many countries are violating conditions within a [fiscal compact](https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/germany-and-e-u-clash-over-fiscal-discipline-723146) signed by 25 member states.
1.3.1.1.2.1. Con: Both France and Germany regularly [ignore](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11207721/Why-do-France-and-Germany-keep-breaking-EU-rules.html?) EU budget guidelines.
1.3.1.2. Pro: French president Emmanuel Macron has extensively [criticised](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-isolated-by-emmanuel-macron-central-european-offensive-posted-workers/) the actions of the Polish government.
1.3.1.3. Pro: The EU is not united on the issue of resettlement of migrants, with [Italy threatening to close its airports](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1028138/eu-migrant-crisis-italy-germany-asylum-seekers-matteo-salvini-charter-flights) for German flights.
1.3.2. Pro: Hungary has violated many EU laws and principles.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Hungary has violated the EU's policies on handling the migrant crisis.
1.3.2.1.1. Pro: The European Court of Justice has [ignored](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/06/eu-court-dismisses-complaints-by-hungary-and-slovakia-over-refugees) Hungary's complaints on EU refugee quotas.
1.3.2.1.2. Pro: Hungary's new "[stop Soros](https://www.ft.com/content/f8cc8108-8aa0-11e8-bf9e-8771d5404543)" rule violates EU asylum rules and the EU's charter of human rights.
1.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: The EU executive has [sent](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-hungary-migration/eu-raps-hungary-for-stop-soros-law-steps-up-legal-battle-idUSKBN1K91CJ) a letter to Hungary condemning the law.
1.3.2.1.3. Con: [Leaked](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44136218) documents from Italy show that the Italian government also planned to defy the EU's migrant policies.
1.3.2.1.4. Con: Hungary is in line with the [official EU migration policies](http://publications.europa.eu/webpub/com/factsheets/migration-crisis/en/) as the country is trying to put efforts into Frontex, tackling the root causes of migration, trying to reduce migrant flows and protecting borders.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Many MEPs are calling for [article 7](https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-eu-news-article-7-vote-poland-rule-of-law/) to be implemented as a response to Hungary breaching "core EU values".
1.3.2.2.1. Con: MEPs are not the ones to decide if a member state breached a law. This is the prerogative of the courts.
1.3.2.2.2. Pro: Hungary's [weakening](https://www.ft.com/content/6c538e70-168f-3d1e-ba92-8a80790a6247) of their constitutional court has been condemned by the European Court of Justice.
1.3.2.2.3. Pro: Viktor Orban and the Hungarian Government have been [accused](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/hungary-orban-balaton/) of large levels of corruption.
1.3.2.2.3.1. Pro: Over the past 8 years Orban established a circle of [oligarchs](https://www.ft.com/content/ecf6fb4e-d900-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482) around him, members of which achieved success primarily through state contracts, about 60 per cent of which are funded by the EU.
1.3.2.2.3.1.1. Pro: The [Corruption Research Center Budapest](https://www.ft.com/content/ecf6fb4e-d900-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482) \(an NGO\), analysed all public procurement contracts from 2010-16. It found four Fidesz-linked businessmen - Lajos Simicska, Lorinc Meszaros, Istvan Garancsi and Istvan Tiborcz - together won 5 per cent of contracts by value, totalling €1.88bn. Contracts won by the four men averaged 13 times the size of other contracts.
1.3.2.2.3.1.2. Pro: [Transparency International](https://www.ft.com/content/ecf6fb4e-d900-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482), based on analysis of contracts since 2007, estimated in 2015 that Hungarian public contracts were overpriced, on average, by 25% compared to market prices.
1.3.2.2.4. Pro: Hungary has been [accused](https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/ana-gurau/hungarian-governments-war-on-free-speech) of cracking down on freedom of speech.
1.3.2.2.4.1. Pro: A 25% [tax](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/hungary-eu-values-refugees-viktor-orban) has been slapped on funding for NGOs that “support immigration”: in practice, that means having anything positive to say about immigration.
1.3.2.2.5. Pro: The Hungarian Government has been restricting [freedom](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2017/hungary) of the press.
1.3.2.2.6. Pro: Hungary has been pushing back against democratic norms that are a major part of EU membership.
1.3.2.2.6.1. Pro: Viktor Orbán boasts Hungary is an [“illiberal democracy”](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/22/hungary-eu-values-refugees-viktor-orban).
1.3.3. Pro: Hungary has constantly been against further cooperation with the EU.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Hungary [vetoed](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/03/09/hungary-slammed-after-blocking-europe-wide-agreement-on-lgbt-rights/) an EU wide policy on LGBT rights.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Countries within the EU regularly veto policies they feel are not in their country's interests.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: Ireland [refused](https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/ireland-will-not-participate-in-any-attempt-for-eu-wide-corporation-tax-rate-805968.html) to participate in an EU wide tax policy to protect its own low corporation tax.
1.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: Poland [vetoed](https://euobserver.com/justice/142825) sanctions against Hungary out of fear it would receive sanctions itself.
1.3.3.1.1.3. Con: While the Council and Parliament have increasingly included veto provisions in EU law, the actual exercise of veto rights has been [extremely low](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2016/10/25/a-dearth-of-legislative-vetoes/).
1.3.3.1.1.4. Con: It is different to veto policies that are not in the country's interest and policies that are securing human rights.
1.3.3.2. Con: Hungary strongly [supports](https://dailynewshungary.com/hungarian-foreign-minister-eu-should-speed-up-enlargement/) EU enlargement.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: If Hungary stays in the EU longer, newly admitted smaller states \(e.g. Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro\), who will have similar interests being similar sized economies, will be likely to help it counter the political will of larger states like Germany and France.
1.3.3.3. Con: Hungary has [collaborated](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/sites/jrcsh/files/jrc_country_leaflet_hu_en.pdf) extensively with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre on many projects.
1.3.3.4. Con: Hungary is supportive of an [EU army](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-founded-as-project-of-peace-debates-a-militarized-future-nato-european-defense-fund-russia/).
1.3.3.5. Pro: Hungary has been obstructive in the [passing of EU budgets](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/955177/EU-news-Viktor-Orban-Hungary-European-Union-budget-latest).
1.3.3.5.1. Con: Many countries including [Italy](https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/business/italy-vows-to-veto-eu-budget-over-migrant-funds-row-864931.html) have also threatened to reject EU budgets.
1.3.3.6. Pro: Orban refuses to cooperate with EU members on the [refugee crisis and minority rights](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-hungary/hungarys-orban-vows-to-defy-eu-pressure-ahead-of-unprecedented-vote-idUSKCN1LR215).
1.3.3.6.1. Con: Despite its vociferous disagreement, Hungary did [accept refugees](https://budapestbeacon.com/hungary-secretly-accepted-1300-refugees-2017/) in 2017 above its quota.
1.3.3.6.2. Pro: This refusal undermines the work that Europe has done on [integration](https://www.cfr.org/article/europe-wrestles-hungarys-populist-challenge) of refugees to date.
1.3.3.7. Pro: Hungary's lack of cooperation with the EU, and the EU's inability to make them comply weakens the [international perception](https://www.cfr.org/article/europe-wrestles-hungarys-populist-challenge) of the EU. This is not beneficial when the EU deals with other organisations.
1.3.4. Con: Many countries within the EU disagree with its policies.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Italy [rejected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/24/eu-countries-may-be-paid-to-host-migrants-in-secure-centres) the EU's proposal to solve the migrant crisis, calling it a "charity handout".
1.3.4.2. Pro: EU is made up of culturally very diverse countries.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Because EU countries are culturally diverse, disagreement between them is inevitable. There is nothing out of the ordinary with Hungary being at odds with the EU on some issues.
1.3.4.2.2. Pro: The EU has 24 [official languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union) and many more spoken amongst its population.
1.3.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.1.
1.3.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.1.2.1.
1.3.4.5. Con: The mere fact that 27 nation states managed to agree on [common foreign & security policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy) is showing that despite differences, member countries of the EU are able to reach compromises.
1.4. Con: Leaving the EU would accelerate the degradation of democracy.
1.4.1. Pro: EU legislation and its direct applicability provides an important check on governments - leaving the EU would open the doors to virtually any kind of authoritarian legislation.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Leaving the European Union would allow for an intensification of xenophobic antagonisms; refugees and minority communities would be at a greater risk of violence and abuse.
1.4.1.2. Pro: EU demands the protection of minorities within Hungary.
1.4.1.2.1. Pro: EU [Charter](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf) of Fundamental Rights guarantees rights and protections for all EU citizens.
1.4.2. Con: Being in the EU erodes confidence in democracy since it makes decisions which do not adequately account for the preferences of Hungarians.
1.4.2.1. Pro: Since at least the [2013 Helsinki hearing](https://hungarianspectrum.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/kim-lane-scheppeles-testimony-at-the-helsinki-commission-hearing-on-hungary-full-text/comment-page-1/) on Hungary, the EU has repeatedly presented serious criticism of Hungary’s ruling government. And yet, no opposition party or coalition has managed to shift Hungarian voters’ preferences. The [majority](https://kozvelemenykutatok.hu/#1) of Hungarian people are either pro-Fidesz, or do not support any existing party at all. Therefore, the EU’s consistent strong attacks on Orban’s government can create the impression that Hungarian people’s democratic choice is not respected by the EU.
1.4.2.2. Pro: In contrast to the EU average, [more Hungarians](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/ResultDoc/download/DocumentKy/83569) tend to trust their national government and parliament than the European Union. This suggests that Hungarian people might feel that their national government more adequately represents their preferences than the EU.
1.4.2.3. Pro: The EU has a democratic deficit.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: Even the EU [recognizes](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/democratic_deficit.html?locale=en) that many voters feel it suffers from a democratic deficit.
1.4.2.3.1.1. Con: The EU has acted to correct this. The democratic basis of the EU has been the European Parliament whose members have been elected by the electorate of the member states. While this is democratic, the electorate places more significance on their votes for their own national government than they do for their MEP, and are subsequently disenchanted that the European Parliament can overrule their national Government.
1.4.2.3.1.2. Con: The public opinion about the democratic deficit in the EU doesn't necessarily reflect reality.
1.4.2.3.1.3. Con: The fact that the EU publicly recognizes this is the mark of a responsive governance system.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: European Parliament elections [suffer](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/05/europes-democratic-deficit-is-getting-worse/371297/) from low turnouts, and increasingly disengaged electorates.
1.4.2.3.2.1. Con: This does not mean the EU has a democratic deficit; the [United States](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/15/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) suffers from similarly low voter turnouts.
1.4.2.3.3. Pro: One of the most powerful EU bodies, the Commission, is [not democratically elected](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/matthew-ellery/eu-referendum_b_9514608.html).
1.4.2.3.3.1. Con: One potential Commissioner is [nominated](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_1.3.8.html) by the ruling \(democratically elected\) national government of each member state. These suggestions are then confirmed by the democratically elected European Parliament. So, the public vote for their own national government and, in doing so, place their trust in them to choose a suitable Commissioner, in an equivalent way to that which the Hungarian public places their trust in their elected representatives to select a suitable Prime Minister.
1.4.2.3.3.2. Con: The President of the Commission \(Jean-Claude Juncker\) was elected by the [Spitzenkandidat process](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/eu-affairs/20150526STO59409/spitzenkandidaten-the-story-of-what-made-last-year-s-ep-elections-different).
1.4.2.3.3.3. Pro: The European Commission is unelected and have been active since 2007. We may elect our MEPs but the [main policy makers](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/c_2017_6915_final_en.pdf) are still unelected and while they are accountable to the European Parliament who can censure their decisions, it is by no means a perfect system as it falls to the foibles of international politics.
1.4.2.3.3.4. Con: The European Commission holds no actual legislative power, and serves a purely executive function, equivalent of that of the Hungarian civil service, which is itself unelected.
1.4.3. Pro: The rights of Hungarian people will not be protected.
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.1.
1.4.3.2. Con: There are many countries that are not EU member states, but are members of the [Council of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_Council_of_Europe), and still fall under the jurisdiction of the [European Court of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights#Jurisdiction). Hungary is a member of the Council of Europe, and its citizens would still be protected by the ECHR, regardless of its membership of the EU.
1.5. Con: Hungary will have significantly less influence in Europe if it leaves the EU, and as a result will be a weaker nation in the international community.
1.5.1. Pro: While within the EU, Hungary has sizable representation in the European parliament \([22 seats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_European_Parliament_for_Hungary,_2009%E2%80%9314)\), as well as throughout all EU institutions.
1.5.2. Pro: Outside the EU, Hungary will have significantly less leverage in international negotiations.
1.5.2.1. Pro: While within the EU, Hungary is negotiating with some of the world's largest economic and military powers on its side.
1.5.2.2. Pro: In the event of a hard exit, Hungary will overnight be excluded from EU arrangements with “third countries”, or non-EU countries, entering the equivalent of a legal void in key parts of its external commercial relations. This exclusion will mean that Hungary will have to renegotiate an incredibly high number of treaties.
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Each agreement has to be reviewed, the country approached, the decision makers found, meetings arranged, trips made, negotiations started and completed. This will take up considerable time and resources of the Hungarian government.
1.5.2.2.2. Pro: Using the example of the UK, Brexit will mean a renegotiation of at least [759](https://www.ft.com/content/f1435a8e-372b-11e7-bce4-9023f8c0fd2e) treaties. Hungary will likely have to negotiate a similar amount with much less leverage.
1.5.2.2.3. Con: Being outside of the EU would likely also give Hungary significantly more freedom to negotiate trade deals with Russia or China.
1.5.3. Con: Hungary's voice is not heard within the EU, so leaving will not make a difference.
1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.3.
1.5.3.2. Pro: The European Court of Justice has ruled against Hungarian laws and stood in opposition of actions taken by the Hungarian state.
1.5.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.2.
1.5.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.
1.5.3.2.3. Pro: The ECJ has [interfered](https://bbj.hu/economy/court-of-justice-finds-hungary-discriminates-in-notary-appointments_128137) in the Hungarian process of notary appointments.
1.5.3.2.4. Con: The ECJ's rulings were all positive, aimed at upholding democracy, the independence of the judiciary, human rights and international competition law.
1.5.3.2.5. Con: If a member state proposes a law that is not compatible with EU law, the ECJ will rule against it, regardless of the content of the proposed legislation or what country proposed it.
1.5.3.2.5.1. Con: The ECJ's rulings against Hungary indicate that Hungary's needs might not be compatible with EU law.
1.5.3.2.6. Con: The EU is always prioritising the effectiveness of EU law, yet there are [15](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-03-1069_en.htm) member states not complying with ECJ rulings and really high number of [infringements](http://ec.europa.eu/atwork/applying-eu-law/infringements-proceedings/infringement_decisions/index.cfm?lang_code=EN&r_dossier=&noncom=0&decision_date_from=&decision_date_to=&active_only=0&DG=TAXU&title=&submit=Search). EU law cannot be [enforced](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-05-482_en.htm), which makes the ECJ fundamentally flawed.
1.5.4. Pro: The EU is using its leverage to make countries adopt policies they don't support, in order to gain [trade benefits](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-trade-deal-paris-climate-change-accord-agreement-cecilia-malmstr-m-a8206806.html).
1.6. Pro: Without restrictions from the EU, Hungary would be free to address pressing political, social and economic problems better.
1.6.1. Pro: The European Union [has failed](https://www.euronews.com/2018/07/28/hungary-s-pm-viktor-orban-attacks-the-eu) to find an appropriate way for Europe to deal with Muslim immigration.
1.6.1.1. Pro: The EU has not given Hungary enough [funds](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/600728/Hungary-EU-cash-immigrants) to deal with the migration crisis.
1.6.2. Con: Orban's government has consistently failed to address political, social or economic problems over the past 8 years - if anything, they only exacerbated them. Nothing guarantees that leaving the EU would have a positive effect on these areas.
1.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.6.2.2. Con: Hungary has some of the [highest projected real wage growth](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/graphic-projected-real-wage-growth-in-selected-oecd-countries-in-2018-118010800069_1.html) among OECD states.
1.6.2.3. Pro: Social and economic [inequality](https://merce.hu/2017/11/24/ketteszakitja-magyarorszag-terkepet-a-gazdasagi-egyenlotlenseg/) remains a huge problem in Hungary, but this is not necessarily reflected in general statistics, only when economic and social data is broken down between the counties.
1.6.2.3.1. Pro: Children born into the wealthiest areas of Hungary are [expected to live](https://merce.hu/2017/11/23/a-borsodiak-negy-evvel-kevesebbet-elnek-mint-a-budapestiek/), on average, four years longer than those born into the poorest parts of the country.
1.6.2.4. Pro: [Antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_contemporary_Hungary), racism and anti-Roma sentiments are persistent social problems in Hungary, and the Orban government's aggressively nationalist and [xenophobic](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-refugees-immigration-viktor-orban-racism-border-fence-a8446046.html) rhetoric has not helped the situation.
1.6.2.5. Pro: During Orban's reign countless [football stadiums](https://444.hu/2016/05/30/megprobaltuk-a-lehetetlent-osszeszedni-az-osszes-mar-kesz-vagy-meg-epulo-stadiont) were built around the country \(by companies close to Orban\) for teams with little to no audience, for a cost of around £300 million, most of which was public money.
1.6.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.1.
1.6.2.7. Pro: The Hungarian [healthcare system](https://www.boell.de/en/2018/05/31/vulnerability-and-chaos-hungarian-healthcare-system) is struggling; doctors' pay is the lowest among OECD countries, there is a growing lack of hospital staff, and government spending remains one of the lowest in Europe.
1.6.2.7.1. Pro: Hospital [financing](https://www.boell.de/en/2018/05/31/vulnerability-and-chaos-hungarian-healthcare-system) is insufficient, which results in a debt of around €120-200 million each year.
1.6.2.7.2. Pro: Due to the lack of sufficient funding and salaries, a system of expected [gratitude payments](https://www.boell.de/en/2018/05/31/vulnerability-and-chaos-hungarian-healthcare-system) developed, which sees citizens slipping envelopes full of cash to their doctors \(and nurses\) after every visit.
1.6.2.8. Pro: Hungary has been heavily criticised for its treatment of minorities such as the [Roma community](https://www.politico.eu/article/the-roma-peoples-hungarian-hell/).
1.6.2.8.1. Pro: The European Commission has led an infringement case against the Hungarian government for the [segregation](http://www.errc.org/press-releases/eu-commission-probe-must-spell-the-end-of-romani-segregation-in-hungarian-schools) of Roma children within education.
1.6.2.9. Pro: The EU has constantly and consistently pressured Orban's government on controversial issues. With rapidly [declining freedom of media](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hungary-newspaper-stops-printing-1.4612656) in Hungary, the EU remains the only actor that is able to significantly do so.
1.6.2.9.1. Pro: In 2012, the European Union threatened Hungary with legal actions over its [controversial reforms](https://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/17/world/europe/hungary-eu-ruling/index.html) that included the independence of the national central bank, the retirement age of judges, and the independence of the country's data protection authority.
1.6.2.9.2. Pro: The deputy head of the European Commission, Frans Timmermans, said on 11th of September, 2018, that he has concerns about [“fundamental rights, corruption, the treatment of Roma and the independence of the judiciary”](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-hungary/hungarys-orban-vows-to-defy-eu-pressure-ahead-of-unprecedented-vote-idUSKCN1LR215) in Hungary under Orban.
1.6.2.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.4.1.1.
1.6.2.9.4. Con: Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has been under criticism of the EU for years now, yet nothing significantly changes in either his support or his politics. It is very questionable if the pressure coming from the EU and its member states is really effective.
1.6.2.9.4.1. Pro: In September of 2018, speaking to the European Parliament plenary session in Strasbourg, in a debate on a resolution to initiate a process that could lead to political sanctions against Hungary — the so-called Article 7 proceedings, Orbán [showed no contrition and no willingness to back down](https://www.politico.eu/article/viktor-orban-unbowed-in-face-of-eu-criticism-hungary-president/).
1.6.2.9.4.2. Pro: Orban is one of the [most popular](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2018/09/13/hungary039s_orban_is_the_most_popular_leader_in_europe_453265.html) leaders in Europe.
1.6.2.9.5. Con: Many EU member states are divided between the East and the West of the EU, as the [debate](https://www.politico.eu/article/state-of-disunion/) on whether Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is trampling democratic freedoms and undermining fundamental rights showed in Strasbourg in September of 2018. The pressure from the EU is therefore ineffective.
1.6.3. Con: The EU does not restrict Hungary in these areas in any meaningful way - if other EU members are able to focus on their political, social and economic problems then Hungary should be able to as well.
1.6.3.1. Pro: EU countries are free to set their own [budgets](https://www.euronews.com/2018/03/15/what-do-different-eu-governments-spend-their-budgets-on-) and decide how much they want to spend on public services.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: The EU does impose [some constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_and_Growth_Pact) on individual countries' fiscal policies.
1.6.3.2. Pro: EU countries are free to decide the content and organisation of their education systems, which is illustrated in the [myriad of different systems](http://eurydice.indire.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Structures_2017_18_diagrams_final_report.pdf) existing within the EU.
1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.2.
1.6.5. Pro: In the EU, Hungary isn't able to pursue its own interests. Decisions within the EU have to be consensual, which means many compromises need to be made.
1.6.5.1. Pro: The top argument favouring Brexit, prior to the referendum, was that the EU strips the UK of its sovereignty. [The voting procedures](http://law.emory.edu/eilr/content/volume-31/issue-4/comments/mechanisms-eu-undermine-national-interest-study-sanctions-regime.html) in the EU institutions often leave countries overruled.
1.6.5.1.1. Pro: The EU is using the ["qualified majority"](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/qualified_majority.html) voting system, which often forces member states to adopt policies they don't necessarily agree with.
1.6.6. Con: EU "restrictions" on social issues are often there to protect minorities from discrimination from their government.
1.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.2.8.
1.6.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.
1.7. Pro: Hungary would be better off economically outside the Single Market.
1.7.1. Con: Hungary would become less competitive as it would now be exposed to potentially higher transaction costs associated with crossing now regulated borders and different trade regulations.
1.7.1.1. Con: Hungary could negotiate a new trade deal with the EU.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: The UK is finding it extremely [difficult](https://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/eu-plans-for-brexit-delay-as-talks-stall-on-trade-37016495.html) to come to an agreement with the EU; it is likely Hungary would find it as difficult.
1.7.1.1.1.1. Pro: Hungary has even less leverage than the UK given that it is a smaller economy and landlocked.
1.7.2. Con: Hungarian economy has a strong reliance on money coming from the EU.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Hungary receives EU subsidies amounting to more than [3 per cent of its GDP](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/poland-and-hungary-could-threaten-the-eu-more-than-brexit-does-1.3211827) each year, the highest percentage of any EU member country.
1.7.2.2. Pro: The [EU](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/hungary_en) spends a total of €4.546 billion in Hungary, while Hungary only contributes €0.924 billion to the EU budget.
1.7.2.3. Pro: Hungary [receives more EU funding](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/717015/hungary-leave-eu-european-union-referendum) per head of population than any other state apart from Lithuania. Leaving the EU would devastate the economy.
1.7.2.4. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.3.1.
1.7.3. Con: The value of Hungary's agricultural exports has more than doubled since they joined the EU \([p.88](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/183182/2/07-1407.pdf)\).
1.7.3.1. Con: Since joining the EU the Hungarian dairy industry has seen a [reduction](https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/107654/2/No.105_7.pdf) in its domestic market share as a result of imports from the EU.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.2.3.
1.7.5. Con: Hungary wouldn't be able to cooperate as usual with other EU countries like Austria, Hungary's [major ally](http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-foreign-affairs-and-trade/news/austria-is-one-of-hungary-s-most-important-allies).
1.7.5.1. Pro: Austria is Hungary's main partner in the field of [defense cooperation](http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-defence/news/cooperation-between-austria-and-hungary-gains-further-strength) and border protection. This cooperation would be much harder to achieve if there was a border between the two states.
1.7.5.2. Pro: Hungary's plans for cultural integration and [infrastructure links](https://dailynewshungary.com/hungary-burgenland-sign-declaration-on-infrastructure-cultural-cooperation/) with Austria would be much more difficult without the benefits of an open border.
1.7.6. Con: [81%](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/hungary_en) of Hungary's trade is within the EU.
1.7.6.1. Con: -> See 1.7.1.1.
1.7.6.2. Pro: Hungary's top export destination is [Germany](https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/hun/).
1.7.7. Pro: New Hungarian industries would face less competition from larger companies in other European states.
1.7.7.1. Pro: By leaving the EU, Hungary would have the option of pursuing a variety protectionist policies to help domestic industries.
1.7.7.1.1. Pro: Hungary could target tariffs on foreign imports that threaten the domestic development of Hungarian industry.
1.7.7.1.2. Pro: Hungary would have more freedom to subsidize growing industries when it does not have the EU [anti-subsidization regulations](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/accessing-markets/trade-defence/actions-against-imports-into-the-eu/anti-subsidy/).
1.7.7.1.3. Con: Protectionism undermines market economies, competition and consumer interests.
1.7.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.3.1.
1.8. Pro: Hungarian values are distinct from European or global values. Hungary should defend them against the globalisation agenda of the EU and others.
1.8.1. Pro: Hungary is a Christian country and should protect its right to remain as such.
1.8.1.1. Pro: As per the 7th Amendment to the Constitution, it is the [fundamental duty](https://s4c.news/en/2018/06/27/the-christian-culture-of-hungary-is-now-enshrined-in-the-constitution/) of the Hungarian State to protect the country’s constitutional self-identity and Christian culture.
1.8.1.2. Con: According to the Pew Research Institute's [study](http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/views-on-religion-and-politics/), only around 59% of Hungarians believe in God.
1.8.1.3. Con: According to the 2011 [census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Hungary), only around 54% of Hungarians consider themselves Christian.
1.8.1.4. Pro: Hungary has a [rich history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Christianity_in_Hungary) of being a Christian country, spanning over a millenium.
1.8.1.4.1. Con: Hungary also has a [significant portion](https://theorangefiles.hu/ottoman-hungary/) of its history under the rule of a Muslim empire.
1.8.1.4.1.1. Con: Hungary in its entirety was never conquered by the Ottoman Empire, only a part of it was. The Habsburg [Kingdom of Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary_\(1526–1867\)#Royal_Hungary_\(1526–1699\)) and the [Principality of Transylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Transylvania_\(1570–1711\)) never ceased to be Christian.
1.8.1.4.1.2. Con: Christian subjects of the Ottoman Empire enjoyed [legal protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_the_Ottoman_Empire).
1.8.1.5. Con: This does not mean that the country's values are at odds with the EU. Poland and Ireland are examples of EU members with a strong religious influence.
1.8.1.5.1. Con: Poland is also [at odds](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-poland/eu-lawmakers-back-action-against-poland-amid-democracy-concerns-idUSKCN1GD4KL) with the European Union.
1.8.2. Pro: Hungary is [moving away from the liberal democratic model](https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2018/04/09/will-hungary-leave-eu/) that is part of the core values of the EU, and moving more toward an authoritarian government.
1.8.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.2.6.1.
1.8.3. Con: -> See 1.1.3.1.1.
1.8.4. Pro: Hungarians value homogeneity in their nation, which is shown by the large-scale [popular opposition](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/ResultDoc/download/DocumentKy/83569) to a common European policy on migration.
1.8.5. Con: [Support](https://hungarytoday.hu/support-for-eu-at-record-high/) for the EU in Hungary is at a record high.
1.8.6. Pro: The EU stands for democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of sexuality. If Hungary chooses to have different values, they should not be a part of the EU.
1.8.7. Con: [Many](http://demografia.hu/en/publicationsonline/index.php/demographicportrait/article/download/892/662) EU nationals live in Hungary making the country's values European.
1.9. Con: Other countries may follow if Hungary leaves, setting a dangerous precedent that could lead to the dissolution of the EU.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.2.1.
1.9.2. Pro: [Euro-skepticism](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/03/brexit-has-put-other-leaders-off-wanting-to-leave-says-ec-vice-president) is growing within Europe; Hungary leaving would increase the strength of arguments saying that states do not need the EU.
1.9.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.5.
1.9.3. Pro: The EU is a force for good in the world and is worth being a part of.
1.9.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.3.
1.9.3.2. Pro: The EU fights [globally](http://fra.europa.eu/en/speech/2017/protecting-human-rights-todays-europe) to uphold human rights.
1.9.3.3. Pro: The EU is widely [credited](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/letters/david-cameron-eu-nato-war-in-europe-letters-a7022806.html) for keeping the peace on a continent that has seen some of the worst wars in human history.
1.9.4. Con: The same claim was made prior to Brexit - and there was no country that followed UK on their path.
1.9.4.1. Pro: Brexit has united the EU. As Finland's former PM said, he had never seen [the bloc so unified](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/28/brexit-brings-europe-together-as-britain-starts-packing-its-bags). As many observers have noted, if anything, it led to a renewed spirit of [togetherness and determination​](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/brexit-is-no-excuse-to-start-misunderstanding-the-eu-1.3458484).
1.9.4.2. Con: [Euro skepticism](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36471989) is increasing within the EU.
1.9.4.3. Con: Not enough time has passed to evaluate this in 2018. The Brexit timeline stretches over many years, with the Conservative victory in the 2015 elections followed by the [European Union Referendum Act 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Referendum_Act_2015) in May. The referendum only took place in June 2016, and Britain is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.
1.9.5. Con: The EU's acceptance of its own member states succumbing to authoritarianism is a greater existential threat than Hungary leaving.
1.9.5.1. Pro: Allowing an authoritarian member state remain in the EU sets precedents for other member states to behave in an authoritarian manner. This decreases overall faith in the EU.
1.9.5.1.1. Pro: Having an illiberal member state while espousing liberal values makes the EU seem hypocritical.
