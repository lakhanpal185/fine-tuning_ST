Discussion Title: Sporting Idols and Domestic Abuse: Where Should Sporting Leagues Draw a Line?

1. Sports Leagues Should Have Zero-Tolerance Policies With Regard to Domestic Abuse
1.1. Con: This is unlikely to meaningfully reduce the incidence of domestic violence.
1.1.1. Pro: As evidenced by a case in [2014](http://harvardjsel.com/2015/07/bethany-withers-without-consequence/), sports teams are often unaware of abuse allegations unless formal charges are pressed. Therefore a Zero-Tolerance policy is unlikely to make a difference in stopping domestic abuse since the majority of incidents go unreported to law enforcement.
1.1.1.1. Con: Players with documented histories of domestic violence are drafted into leagues every season, including [five](http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/news/nfl-draft-picks-domestic-violence-joe-mixon-conley-westbrook-brantley/ff1hhe4ypm6g18gv2tdv6zv58) in the 2017 N.F.L. draft. Identification in such cases is feasible.
1.1.1.2. Con: Teams employ private investigators to [vet](https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/04/25/nfl-teams-homework-including-spying-draft-prospects/I5EIHKwSQBvl6fvwQNVkyL/story.html) players before drafting them, and are often aware of more than they let on.
1.1.2. Con: A Zero-Tolerance policy is not only intended to reduce domestic violence, it is also intended to communicate cultural disapproval of it.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Allowing athletes who have committed domestic abuse to continue playing is a [tacit endorsement](http://harvardjsel.com/2015/07/bethany-withers-without-consequence/) of their actions.
1.1.2.1.1. Con: Athletes are paid to play sports, thus leagues need only concern themselves with on-field behavior.
1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: The [unofficial policy](http://perma.cc/FC74-HQV2) of many sports teams is to report criminal conduct internally, rather than to law enforcement. This leads to incidents getting swept under the rug.
1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Leagues face backlash for perceived inaction on issues of criminal behaviour within their playing group. This gives them an active stake in players' off-field behaviour.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Adopting Zero-Tolerance policies would be good for leagues' public images.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: There have been calls to [boycott the NFL](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/15/us/nfl-fallout/) over its systemic inaction on domestic violence.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.2. Con: Zero-Tolerance policies stand to alienate some of the most long-standing and passionate sports supporters.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: For example, fans were outraged when Adrian Peterson \(who was found criminally guilty of child abuse\) was [suspended for a season](https://www.google.com.au/amp/ftw.usatoday.com/2014/11/adrian-peterson-nfl-suspension/amp).
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Many reactions to the suspension were [positive](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/11/adrian-peterson-nfl-suspension).
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: It's ethically dubious for sports leagues to put the desires of their fans before the well-being of abuse victims.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con: The fans pay for the leagues while victims don't. This makes it ethically correct to look more after the fans' desires.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Con: It is morally wrong for the leagues to put their commercial interest before the safety of abuse victims.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.3. Con: Implementing these policies could draw in a whole new fan-base. In particular, it would likely increase the number of female fans who will undoubtedly respond positively if the leagues prove that they care about victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.3. Con: Where a player is seen as being either unfairly punished or unfairly acquitted under Zero-Tolerance, there will be huge backlash from supporters and society at large.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: The backlash resulting from unfair acquittals exists under the status quo when leagues fail to act on charges of domestic violence. At least under a Zero-Tolerance policy leagues will be seen to be attempting to solve the issue.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4. Con: Zero-Tolerance Policies will lead to extreme backlash from players.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Athletes have been known to [demand harsher punishments](http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-kelce-its-a-joke-that-greg-hardy-is-able-to-play-so-quickly/) for those who commit acts of domestic violence. They would likely welcome a universally harsh policy.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.2. Pro: Players will no longer believe that the league has their best interests at heart if a Zero-Tolerance policy is introduced.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.2.1. Con: This would only apply to perpetrators of domestic violence. Law-abiding players do not think of themselves as potential criminals and would think of the policy as distant from them; they could therefore still see the league as having their interests at heart.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.3. Con: The prevalence of domestic violence among athletes damages the reputation of all athletes. They will likely support a policy that redeems their image.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.4. Con: [Many athletes](https://www.bustle.com/articles/80453-5-athletes-who-fight-domestic-violence-because-they-are-just-that-awesome) are committed to solving the problem of domestic violence in sport. Any policy that could help this cause would likely be popular among athletes.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.5. Pro: Changes to disciplinary policy would have to be collectively bargained with the players unions, which would expend time, resources, and political capital on fighting to weaken or circumvent the policy rather than on more productive matters.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.6. Pro: Players are already [mistrustful and resentful](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/sports/football/roger-goodell-nfl-players-union.html) of existing league-imposed discipline and wish to strip the leagues of this power. Expansions of disciplinary power will be deeply unpopular.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.7. Pro: Given the celebrity status of some of these athletes, this backlash is likely to crowd out more nuanced commentary in the press.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.8. Con: The purpose of this policy is to change the culture of the league such that domestic violence is considered absolutely unacceptable.
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.5. Con: Every time a player is prominently linked to a crime in the media, the league's brand suffers, which has caused past cases to be swept under the rug. The severity of the Zero Tolerance punishment will call more media attention to the misdeeds of players, resulting in a net negative effect on [public relations](http://www.espn.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/12235694/impact-league-made).
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Repeated coverage of doping cases at the Tour de France have given the Tour a negative [reputation](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/why-its-still-so-hard-to-cheer-for-the-tour-de-france/).
1.1.2.1.1.2.1.5.2. Pro: High profile punishments will bring high profile media coverage, exaggerating the criminality of athletes and tarnishing the league's brand.
1.1.2.1.1.3. Con: Athletes are paid not just for their on-field prowess, but also as representatives for their sport and/or country. Given we pay them very well, and they accrue other benefits as a result of their high profile, it is legitimate to hold them to a high standard.
1.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: It is unfair to hold athletes to this standard when the President of the United States, who is supposed to be the nation's ultimate representative, is [not](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/assault-allegations-donald-trump-recapped/).
1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Many people believe that Zero-Tolerance would have been a better approach to take here as well.
1.1.2.1.1.3.2. Con: Any high-profile employee could be called a 'representative' for their employer; there is no reason for athletes to be treated as a special case.
1.1.2.1.1.3.2.1. Pro: Just like any other job, athletes pay income tax, have workplace safety requirements, and are subject to labor law. The fact that they are on TV should not change how we treat them.
1.1.2.1.1.4. Con: Sporting stars are often able to avoid harshness in the criminal justice system; the potential loss of their position would be a much more effective deterrent.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: Without a strong deterrent, sporting stars will continue to perpetrate domestic abuse, knowing they can get away with it. Society will not see any growth or rehabilitation.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Reverential attention of fans and the media enables many athletes to feel like they can be treated differently than the average person and thus absolved of accountability. A Zero-Tolerance policy would help eliminate that mindset.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2. Con: [Player-conduct policies](http://deadspin.com/zero-tolerance-for-domestic-violence-will-only-make-it-1787428167) are about public relations, crisis management, and image control. Leagues have no obligation to turn players into better people.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.1. Con: Even if leagues suffer some short term damage, successfully rehabilitating a former abuser would become a PR success story in the long run.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: As private entities, sports leagues need only care about what is in their best interest.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.1. Con: Even if this is the case, Zero-Tolerance policies fail to strike the balance between a positive image and the need not to lose players to bans; therefore zero tolerance policies are not in the leagues' best interest.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2. Con: Sporting leagues receive a significant amount of [money and subsidies from the government](http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/30/news/companies/nfl-taxpayers/). As such, they are obligated to uphold the morals of society.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1. Con: Individuals and organisations are required to uphold the law, but not any higher moral code. Zero-Tolerance policies go above and beyond the basic rule of law.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1. Pro: It is morally inconsistent to hold sports players - or anyone with fame - to a higher standard than anyone else. We hold everyone to a legal standard in society; if we are to increase the standard, either increase it for absolutely everyone or absolutely no-one.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: Musicians and actors are equally often role models for children; it is illegitimate to place that burden only on one profession.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The correct solution for this inconsistency is to hold actors and musicians up to the same standard and not to refrain from raising the standard for athletes.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Celebrities intrinsically have more power due to their elevated social status, and with more power comes more responsibility.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Rich people have more power but do not necessarily have more responsibility.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Celebrities have the ability to influence the public agenda because their voices are more present in the public discourse.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1.3. Con: While legal standards must be equal to everybody in a democracy, social and ethical standards are expected to be higher for public figures as they have a wider impact on society.
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.3. Pro: Sports leagues have routinely placed their own interests above other concerns, whether in their opposition to [free agency](https://www.villanovau.com/resources/bls/history-free-agency-pro-sports/) and [guaranteed contracts](http://www.sbnation.com/2016/7/13/12139416/nfl-contracts-nba-free-agency-nflpa-cba), or medical policies related to [concussions](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/sports/football/nfl-concussion-research-tobacco.html) and [painkillers](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/12/health/nfl-painkiller-lawsuit/index.html).
1.1.2.1.1.4.1.3. Con: If the judiciary finds that a person is not guilty it is the best possible decision because the judiciary is our supreme arbiter in society.
1.1.2.1.1.4.2. Pro: Sporting stars have considerable financial resources, making them less likely to be convicted and more likely to be able to settle with their victims and avoid criminal charges.
1.1.2.1.1.4.3. Con: Leagues are currently [complicit](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/janay-rice-ravens-suggested-apology_n_6248954) in this because they shelter athletes and propagate a message of their innocence in the media. If they were to cooperate more with police, prosecutions would probably be more successful.
1.1.2.1.1.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.1.1.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5. Con: Domestic abuse is notoriously difficult to prove. This will be even more so the case in sports leagues, where there is a large power differential between the victim and abuser.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.1. Con: This does not mean we should not punish domestic violence effectively when we can prove it.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.1.1. Con: Where victims' claims cannot be proven and players are not banned, it will be seen as concrete proof that the players are innocent, making it impossible to criticise them and further alienating their victims.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.1.3.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.2. Con: Given how hard it is to prove domestic or sexual violence, it is good that victims are given an avenue for justice where the standard of proof is lower than that required in the criminal justice system.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.2.1. Con: Where a policy imposes a higher punishment, as is the case with Zero-Tolerance, the evidentiary standard needs to be higher. This will lead to fewer people being reprimanded on net.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.5.2.1.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.4. Pro: As it currently stands, the only cases of domestic abuse that have been taken seriously by sports leagues are those that come with [proof](http://deadspin.com/zero-tolerance-for-domestic-violence-will-only-make-it-1787428167) either in the form of a video, photos, or a confession. Not even bruises or the corroboration of witnesses are enough for victims to be taken at their word.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.4.1. Pro: In some cases, such evidence has failed to be enough for incidents to be taken seriously. For example, a 2013 video reportedly showing NFL player Junior Galette [hitting a woman with a belt](http://mag.bleacherreport.com/nfl-domestic-violence-policy-suspensions/) during a beach brawl appears to have never even been investigated.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.4.2. Con: If leagues aren't even investigating instances like this right now \(presumably because they want to avoid controversy\), it is unclear why this would change under a more polarizing Zero-Tolerance policy.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.4.3. Con: A requirement to provide proof is a good measure to prevent unfair rulings.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.5.1.1.
1.1.2.1.1.4.5.6. Con: A Zero-Tolerance policy does not preclude the police from prosecuting as well; it simply adds another layer of accountability for athletes.
1.1.2.1.1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.1.3.
1.1.2.1.1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.5.4.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.1.1.
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: For many athletes, the notoriety afforded by their alleged abuse actually increases their fame.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The social status and fame afforded to athletes allows them to spin the narrative of their alleged abuse in a way that is beneficial and/or profitable to them.
1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: For example, athletes like [O.J. Simpson](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2007/01/ojsimpson200701) and Wayne Carey have both published memoirs, which pique public interest by referencing their alleged abuses.
1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: Domestic abuse allegations are more likely to cost an athlete endorsement money than to bring them any monetary benefit. [Morality clauses](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/nfl-sponsors-pulling-back-but-not-out-over-domestic-violence-scandal-1.2771730) allow sponsors to cut ties with athletes more easily.
1.1.2.1.3.1.2.1. Pro: For example, Nike and EA both [cancelled](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/nfl-sponsors-pulling-back-but-not-out-over-domestic-violence-scandal-1.2771730) their endorsement deals with Ray Rice following the release of the tape showing him punching his then-fiancee in the face.
1.1.2.1.3.1.2.2. Pro: Various sponsors [cut or suspended ties](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/nfl-sponsors-pulling-back-but-not-out-over-domestic-violence-scandal-1.2771730) to Minnesota Vikings player Adrian Peterson when he faced charges related to hitting his four-year-old son with a switch.
1.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Widely publicizing athletes' domestic abuse scandals has not negatively impacted viewership; in fact, [data](http://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2014/09/15/nfl-scandals-tv-ratings) shows that ratings have only increased during these times.
1.1.2.1.3.3. Con: Where this happens, leagues are not to blame. Rather, it is the media who glamorizes the athlete.
1.1.2.1.3.3.1. Con: Since PR is such an important aspect of athletics, it should be the responsibility of the leagues to minimize the unchecked spread of information regarding domestic abuse scandals involving their players.
1.1.2.1.3.3.2. Con: Leagues may not be to blame, but they are complicit insofar as they also profit from the athlete's profile being raised \(e.g. through viewership and merchandise sales\).
1.1.2.1.4. Con: When a company hires an employee who has been accused or convicted of a crime it is not a tacit endorsement of the crime. It is a gamble that their contributions to the company will be worth the potential risk of investing in them.
1.1.2.1.4.1. Con: However, most jobs do not entail the employee being a public figure, signing sponsorship and advertisement contracts or being a representative of the team outside the workplace.
1.1.2.1.5. Pro: As a victim, it would be hugely traumatic to see a crowd of people cheering for your abuser.
1.1.2.1.5.1. Pro: Yes, watching your abuser run out onto a playing field to the cheer of the crowd and fellow players has to be a devastating feeling. Even more so if there are children involved. As a victim, how do you fight this battle when it seems the abuser has the complete, unwavering support of league owners and the public at large. Watching them smile, laugh, play, and just go on with their lives as if nothing has happened should be classified as cruel and unusual punishment.
1.1.2.2. Pro: For better or worse, sports leagues have a significant role in shaping cultural norms.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: Many sports are intimately linked to nationalist ideals, and thus the success or failure of international teams can literally shape a nation's identity.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The popularity of certain sports is often linked to a nation's cultural and political history.
1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Pro: For example, cricket was, and still is predominantly played by [nations which were colonised by Great Britain](http://newhistories.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/wordpress/not-quite-cricket-%E2%80%93-crickets-relationship-with-british-colonialism/).
1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Pro: Some sporting competitions, like the [Commonwealth Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games), are directly linked to a nation's political and diplomatic alliances.
1.1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro: The [South African rugby team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_rugby_union_team#Apartheid_and_transformation) has come to function as a symbol of the post-apartheid nation.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: The victory of a national sporting team is often portrayed as a victory for the entire country.
1.1.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: For example, when Australia first won the America's Cup sailing race in 1983, Prime Minister Bob Hawke [declared a public holiday](http://www.smh.com.au/sport/hawke-relives-cups-glory-days-when-no-boss-wanted-to-be-labelled-a-bum-20130926-2ugzt.html) for citizens to celebrate.
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Sports leagues are not actually creating negative norms in the first place. For example, the rate of domestic and sexual violence arrests in the NFL is only [55.4% of what it is in the general population](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-rate-of-domestic-violence-arrests-among-nfl-players/).
1.1.2.2.2.1. Con: This rate, however, is more than [4 times worse](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-rate-of-domestic-violence-arrests-among-nfl-players/) than the average rate at which NFL players commit crimes relative to the population \(13%\). This suggests that there is a cultural problem.
1.1.2.2.2.2. Con: Collegiate athletes comprise [3% of student bodies, but 19% of sexual abuse and violence](https://www.livescience.com/47949-pro-athletes-domestic-violence.html), suggesting a link between athletics and violence compared with the general population.
1.1.2.2.2.3. Con: Though athlete arrest rates for domestic violence are below average for their typical age demographics, arrest rates are [above average for their income bracket](https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/more-on-the-rate-of-domestic-violence-arrests-among-nfl-players/), demonstrating an abnormal propensity towards violence compared to citizens of similar economic status.
1.1.2.2.3. Con: The practice of sports is [declining](https://www.parent.co/baseball-is-losing-popularity-with-kids-so-are-most-team-sports/) among young children, highlighting that sports may be losing its preponderant status in our culture.
1.1.2.2.3.1. Con: This could also just be a symptom of increasing laziness and a desire to watch others play sport, but not participate oneself.
1.1.2.2.3.2. Con: Sporting league's TV viewership, a better estimate of their influence, is at an [all-time high](http://www.spottedratings.com/2011/06/definitive-sports-tv-ratings-post-2010.html), evidenced by the astronomical prices paid to [broadcast games](http://www.totalsportek.com/money/biggest-tv-deals-sports/).
1.1.2.2.4. Con: Society is in grave trouble if it is basing its views on women on sporting culture.
1.1.2.2.4.1. Con: For better or worse, many people's attitudes are based on sporting culture. This is exactly why attitudes in sporting culture need to improve.
1.1.2.2.5. Pro: Innumerable children look up to athletes as role models.
1.1.2.2.5.1. Pro: It is important for children to see that power cannot absolve you of responsibility and protect you from punishment; otherwise they will not understand how they should treat those with less power than themselves.
1.1.2.2.5.2. Pro: If children see athletes consistently committing acts of violence against vulnerable people, they will be more likely to see these acts as acceptable behaviour.
1.1.2.2.5.3. Con: Children young enough to unquestioningly accept and revere everything their favourite sports star does are likely too young to understand what sexual/domestic violence is in any meaningful way.
1.1.2.2.5.3.1. Con: Research has shown that children who have witnessed or experienced domestic violence have a coherent understanding of it. It follows that children could understand the issue if it was explained to them or they heard about it in the media. \([Hogan and Reilly, p.2](https://www.dcya.gov.ie/documents/publications/listening_childrens_stories_domestic_violence_11_oct_07.pdf)\).
1.1.2.2.5.3.1.1. Con: Insofar as this is true, it is likely that children will then reject those athletes as role models because of their poor behaviour.
1.1.2.2.5.4. Con: [Children](http://www.lifescript.com/well-being/articles/d/does_your_child_have_a_sports_role_model.aspx) very rarely admire sports players for their behavior off the field, therefore what athletes do at home is irrelevant to their role model status.
1.1.2.2.5.4.1. Con: When asked to choose someone they look up to, [13-28%](https://blogs.psychcentral.com/sports-couch/2014/06/are-athletes-heroes/) of children choose athletes. This shows that a large proportion of fans think of athletes as heroes and not simply skilled players.
1.1.2.2.5.4.2. Con: If a player is removed from the league because of a Zero-Tolerance policy, every fan will read about the reason for their removal. This is a very strong statement that will be heard even by those who usually do not care about an athlete's behavior off the field.
1.1.2.2.5.4.2.1. Con: A person can admire or look up to an athlete's skills on the playing field and still be incredibly upset about the behavioral choices that they’re making at home. The two are not mutually exclusive, since exhibiting abusive behavior does not lessen someone's athletic talent.
1.1.2.2.5.4.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.5.4.1.
1.1.2.2.5.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1.2.
1.1.2.2.5.6. Pro: Professional athletes have a direct influence on the next generation of athletes by holding [camps](http://www.procamps.com/camps), and remaining connected to their alma maters. Zero tolerance is essential to preventing violent tendencies in the next generation of professional athletes.
1.1.2.2.6. Pro: Regardless of whether it is fair to hold athletes to a higher standard, Zero-Tolerance policies will encourage stronger norms against domestic violence in wider society.
1.1.2.2.7. Con: Sports leagues already do a lot of social good in other areas. We should not require them to be perfect moral actors.
1.1.2.2.7.1. Pro: Sport can be an effective tool for creating  [cohesion between disparate social groups](https://www.clearinghouseforsport.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/316405/MoreThanWinning.pdf).
1.1.2.2.7.2. Pro: Sports and sporting culture are good for [public health and wellbeing](http://www.clubhelp.org.au/sites/default/files/pdf/Healthy%20Clubs/La%20Trobe_Sport-Rec-Community_research.pdf).
1.1.2.2.7.3. Con: Most of these benefits can be attributed to community-level sports, not elite sporting leagues.
1.1.2.2.7.3.1. Con: The two are undeniably interrelated, as the leagues generate public interest and resources which help sustain community-level competition.
1.1.2.2.7.4. Pro: The NBA and NFL have been [vocal opponents](http://www.dallasnews.com/news/lgbt/2017/02/17/nba-joins-nfl-warn-texas-transgender-bathroom-bill) of bills which deny transgender people access to bathrooms which reflect their identity.
1.1.2.2.7.4.1. Pro: Gender segregated toilets as of now discriminate against transgender people as well as people unsure of their gender by forcing them to make a \(sometimes impossible\) choice on a daily basis.
1.1.2.2.7.5. Con: Abuse or assault against another human being is widely viewed as unacceptable behavior. Asking an athlete not to engage in these activities does not mean that they're expected to be a "perfect moral actor", but rather that they should be held to the basic human expectation of treating other people with respect.
1.1.2.2.7.6. Con: This is a poor standard to set. It could, for instance, be used as a justification for ignoring the crimes committed by an individual because of the good they do in other areas.
1.1.2.2.8. Pro: Sports has always held a spot of heightened public visibility. As such, instead of playing from behind, they should be at forefront of limiting domestic violence - instead of tacitly embracing \(such as boxing and Floyd Mayweather\).
1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.
1.1.4. Pro: Zero-Tolerance policies are likely to [increase](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/opinion/07iyengar.html?_r=0) instances of domestic violence.
1.1.4.1. Pro: [Financial and job related anxieties](http://deadspin.com/zero-tolerance-for-domestic-violence-will-only-make-it-1787428167) have been recognized as contributing factors for violence. Making those worse could actually worsen the abuse experienced by victims.
1.1.4.1.1. Con: It is unlikely that professional athletes feel financial anxiety.
1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The median wage of an NFL player is $1.9 million, and that is one of the [lowest average wages for professional athletes](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/charts-expose-how-badly-nfl-players-get-paid-2013-9) in the USA.
1.1.4.1.1.2. Con: According to a 2009 Sports Illustrated article, 60 percent of former NBA players are [broke](http://www.espn.com/30for30/film?page=broke) within five years of retirement. By the time they have been retired for two years, 78% of former NFL players have gone bankrupt or are under financial stress.
1.1.4.1.1.3. Con: Many athletes come from underprivileged backgrounds, and are thrust into the world of professional sports at age 18-21, with fame, freedom, and money for the first time in their life and without any kind of familial support to teach them how to live this type of lifestyle. This is not a recipe for sound decision making, financially or otherwise.
1.1.4.1.1.4. Con: It is reasonable to assume that anyone who loses their source of income will feel financial anxiety, since presumably their remaining money will run out at some point.
1.1.4.1.2. Con: Insofar as their job is making them anxious, being removed from the highly stressful environment of professional sport is likely to relieve some of this.
1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Athletes often have people [asking them](http://www.espn.com/30for30/film?page=broke) for money/favors/etc. Once the athlete is out of the spotlight, these people go away.
1.1.4.1.2.2. Con: If a player loses their job then they will spend more time at home, which provides more opportunities for them to be abusive.
1.1.4.1.2.3. Con: If job-related stress is replaced by the financial stress of unemployment, an athlete's overall stress level will likely stay the same, if not increase.
1.1.4.1.3. Pro: A Zero-Tolerance policy has all of the aggravating elements of criminal punishment without offering the victim any legal protection \(e.g. putting the offender in prison or taking out a restraining order\).
1.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: Experts on domestic violence have said that when victims come forward to report the abuse, it is [crucial to remove themselves from the situation](http://childprotectionresource.online/if-i-report-domestic-violence-social-services-will-take-my-children/) as quickly as possible to protect themselves.
1.1.4.1.3.2. Pro: In one [case](http://deadspin.com/zero-tolerance-for-domestic-violence-will-only-make-it-1787428167), a Seminole County woman was thrown in jail for refusing to testify against her abusive husband after domestic assault charges had been brought against him. Her reason for refusing to do so was because the last time she pursued charges against him, he lost his job.
1.1.4.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.2.3.
1.1.4.2. Pro: Victims are likely to face extreme retribution from their abusive partners if them coming forward loses the player their job.
1.1.4.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.3.
1.1.4.2.2. Pro: One abuse survivor and women's rights advocate [asserts](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2016/07/05/jose-reyes-joins-mets-domestic-violence-advocates-ponder-punishment/86698770/) that a Zero-Tolerance policy is harmful because when there's so much more for the abuser to lose, it becomes more likely that they'll try to kill the victim if they attempt to report them to the authorities.
1.1.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.2.2.
1.1.4.4. Con: Athletes are [more likely to change their behaviour](http://theconversation.com/violence-against-women-and-sports-ethical-responsibility-or-brand-control-32270) due to contractual obligations than out of respect for women and gender equality. If their contracts are not threatened, athletes will be unlikely to refrain from abusive behaviour.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Advocates for survivors of domestic violence have [said](http://www.pressherald.com/2016/01/22/fame-abuse-are-no-strangers-say-advocates-for-domestic-violence-victims/) that perpetrators knowingly decide to abuse, and that they are more likely to stop if important aspects of their life - such as their money - are at stake.
1.1.4.4.2. Con: Domestic and sexual violence are normally associated with [poor impulse control](http://psychologyinfo.com/problems/impulse_control.html#DV) in split-second decisions, meaning that athletes are unlikely to use a rational calculus and respond to deterrents.
1.1.4.4.2.1. Con: However, even if some forms of domestic violence are linked to irrational reactions, studies have found some measures have [deterrent](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095575?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) effects. For example, as opposed to giving the offender advice or letting him go, arrest decreases repeated abuse \([Department of Justice, p. 11](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/225722.pdf)\).
1.1.4.5. Con: [Many](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/perpetrators-sexual-violence) perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence will go on to reoffend. Circuit breakers, like a Zero-Tolerance policy, are necessary to disrupt this toxic cycle of abuse.
1.1.4.5.1. Pro: According to [Lenore Walker's Cycle of Violence](http://www.1736familycrisiscenter.org/pdf/Cycle%20of%20Violence_v3.pdf), domestic abuse is characterized by a tension-building phase followed by an acute battering incident and then a honeymoon period. Without intervention, the cycle perpetually repeats itself - often with the physical violence intensifying over time.
1.1.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.1.4.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.2.
1.1.4.5.4. Pro: Even if they go on to re-offend, athletes who lose their job under a Zero-Tolerance policy are more likely to be prosecuted when they no longer have their fame or club's resources to hide behind.
1.1.4.6. Pro: Banning a player removes them from the community that they respect and that could potentially help them. As one professor [explains](http://deadspin.com/zero-tolerance-for-domestic-violence-will-only-make-it-1787428167) “isolating someone from their meaningful community just means that they displace their violence onto someone else.”
1.1.4.6.1. Con: Insofar as the sporting community has either explicitly or tacitly condoned the abuse they have perpetrated, this separation is both reasonable and necessary.
1.1.4.7. Pro: If a player is afraid for their job, they are more likely to increase their control over and abuse of the victim in order to prevent them from coming forward.
1.1.4.7.1. Con: That is equally true if the abuser thinks the victim will report them to the police, and yet that is not a reason why domestic abuse should not be reported and prosecuted.
1.1.5. Pro: There already exist legal consequences for domestic violence, yet it still exists.
1.1.5.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.
1.1.5.3. Pro: Owing to various cracks in the criminal justice system and the difficulty of prosecuting he-said/she-said crimes, only a mere [2%](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-web-violence/201410/guess-how-many-domestic-violence-offenders-go-jail) of domestic violence offenders ever receive any jail time.
1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.6.
1.1.7. Con: Zero-Tolerance policies are the most effective deterrent to domestic and sexual violence.
1.1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.1.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.
1.1.7.3. Con: A Zero-Tolerance policy is more likely to deter victims from coming forward than it is to deter athletes from engaging in abusive behavior.
1.1.7.3.1. Pro: Often, victims of domestic violence love and care for their abusive partners. They will not want to come forward if it risks their partner losing everything.
1.1.7.3.1.1. Con: This claim could also apply to criminal charges or temporary suspensions; therefore, victims who care about their abusers will surely never come forward.
1.1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: A victim might be willing to speak to friends, colleagues or the police if they believe it will stop their partner without ruining their life. Community service would not ruin a player's life, but a lifetime ban or a firing would.
1.1.7.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Even though legislations vary depending on the state, if the injuries are severe and the accused if found guilty, the penalty may include jail time. That would also be seen as ruining the abuser’s life and yet some victims still come forward.
1.1.7.3.1.2. Pro: According to law professor Leigh Goodmark, some women have "goals that they prioritize over safety or accountability" such as economic security or preserving relationships with family and friends [\(Goodmark, p. 46\)](http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?params=/context/law_journal_law_policy/article/1093/&path_info=).
1.1.7.3.1.2.1. Con: However, the proposal is not to stop prosecution altogether or to suggest that women should stay with abusive partners - which can lead to their [deaths](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/23/domestic-violence-statistics_n_5959776.html) -, the professor advocates for a better [understanding](http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?params=/context/law_journal_law_policy/article/1093/&path_info=) of the variety of women’s goals so that institutional interventions can help them better.
1.1.7.3.1.3. Pro: Since athletes make large sums of money, their partners are often [financially dependent](http://harvardjsel.com/2015/07/bethany-withers-without-consequence/) on them. Victims might therefore be unwilling to report abuse since the loss of the athlete's job will adversely affect the victim as well.
1.1.7.3.2. Pro: If an athlete's career is over after the first infraction, then there is going to be massive pressure on the victim not to call for help.
1.1.7.3.2.1. Pro: Victims of domestic violence are already put under pressure to 'stand by' their partner and blamed if they come forward. Zero-Tolerance policies would make this worse, as the victim would feel or be told that coming forward would destroy their partner's career.
1.1.7.3.3. Pro: Sports teams foster a [family mentality](http://perma.cc/FC74-HQV2) among the players and their spouses; thus when a spouse reports abuse, they are ostracized from the group rather than supported. A Zero-Tolerance policy would aggravate this.
1.1.7.3.4. Pro: Since athletes make large sums of money, their partners are often [financially dependent](http://harvardjsel.com/2015/07/bethany-withers-without-consequence/) on them. Hence, Zero-Tolerance polices could leave the victim, as well as the abuser, financially insecure.
1.1.7.3.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.
1.1.7.3.4.2. Pro: When [Robert Sands](http://perma.cc/FC74-HQV2) was accused by his wife of domestic abuse, he cleared out their joint checking account and she was forced to rely on food stamps.
1.1.7.3.5. Pro: Although only a small number of professional athletes' wives have [spoken out](http://deadspin.com/zero-tolerance-for-domestic-violence-will-only-make-it-1787428167) about this issue, they have all agreed that they do not support heavy league punishments. As victims and potential victims, their opinion should matter the most.
1.1.7.3.5.1. Con: Given the small number who have spoken out, it would be presumptuous to assume that all professional athletes' wives feel that way.
1.1.7.3.5.2. Con: It is likely that if other athletes' partners feel differently they would be afraid to support Zero-Tolerance policies in public for fear of retribution from their partners or fans.
1.1.7.3.5.2.1. Con: Many of the partners who have spoken out against Zero-Tolerance policies have done so [anonymously](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/10/17/for-battered-nfl-wives-a-message-from-the-cops-and-the-league-keep-quiet/?utm_term=.810131ddb796), thus fear of retribution is not a motivating factor.
1.1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.2.
1.1.7.5. Con: Zero-Tolerance policies have proven [ineffective](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/opinion/07iyengar.html?_r=0) in law enforcement.
1.1.7.5.1. Con: For law enforcement, Zero-Tolerance policies require mandatory arrests whenever domestic abuse is reported. In contrast, sports leagues would not fire a player unless the investigation concluded that they committed a crime.
1.2. Pro: This generates important social discourse around domestic abuse.
1.2.1. Pro: Domestic and sexual violence are endemic within sporting cultures, yet [these cases](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/10/17/for-battered-nfl-wives-a-message-from-the-cops-and-the-league-keep-quiet/?utm_term=.87675e77a3d8) rarely surface.
1.2.1.1. Con: This issue is regularly covered in the media; the real problem is that the coverage [does not further the cause of victims](http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/04/24/dicaro-the-disgusting-media-whitewashing-of-floyd-mayweather/). More discourse will not help the issue.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Media coverage also comes with the added risk of spreading inaccurate information, which can ultimately be harmful to fostering positive public discourse about the issue.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: The social discourse created around this issue is likely to be extremely counter-productive to finding real solutions for victims.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: When a player loses their job as a result of this policy, there is likely to be an ensuing media storm. A lot of this coverage is likely to be negative towards the victim.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This media coverage also throws domestic violence into the public consciousness, forcing people to discuss the issue.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: A Utah-based [study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07491409.2007.10162504) on domestic assault coverage showed that once involved, the media tends to frame violence against women in ways that avoid addressing gendered power imbalances.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: If an athlete has a history of being abusive, media coverage of one case might give previous victims the impetus to come forward.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1.4. Con: Even where some of the coverage is positive in furthering the discourse, this is likely to come at the expense of expansive victim blaming.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: It is morally abhorrent to use vulnerable women as social battering rams.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1.4.1.1. Con: It is more abhorrent to condemn future victims to abuse by not creating a meaningful deterrent.
1.2.1.1.2.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.7.3.
1.2.1.1.2.1.2. Con: In popular media, being seen as "light" on domestic violence is [cause for criticism](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/sports/football/giants-josh-brown-abuse-nfl.html).
1.2.1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro: This media backlash can actually encourage the leagues to take [affirmative steps](http://nomore.org/nflplayerspsa/) to address domestic violence.
1.2.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Sports leagues are more concerned with image than doing good, meaning even these "steps" are more [speech than action](http://deadspin.com/no-more-the-nfls-domestic-violence-partner-is-a-sham-1683348576).
1.2.1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: It is difficult to judge from one case and one media outlet the stance of popular media as a whole.
1.2.1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Instead of being seen as a victim of domestic violence, a victim in this scenario could be said to be 'ruining the player's career' by coming forward.
1.2.1.1.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.2.1.1.2.1.5. Pro: When a video was released of Ray Rice punching his fiance, his team suggested that she should [apologize](http://harvardjsel.com/2015/07/bethany-withers-without-consequence/) for her role in the incident, as did prominent sportscaster [Stephen A. Smith](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/espn-suspends-stephen-a--smith-over-ray-rice-domestic-abuse-commentary-213719386.html).
1.2.1.1.2.1.6. Pro: A common mentality is that male professional athletes' social status leads to women throwing themselves at them. Therefore people are less likely to believe victims who report sexual assaults by athletes.
1.2.1.1.2.1.7. Pro: For example, the [Steubenville](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-lessons-of-steubenville) rape case generated a huge negative backlash against its victim.
1.2.1.1.2.1.7.1. Pro: Even mainstream, progressive leaning networks, [like CNN](http://gawker.com/5991003/cnn-reports-on-the-promising-future-of-the-steubenville-rapists-who-are-very-good-students), were criticised for victim-blaming in their coverage.
1.2.1.1.2.1.8. Con: That fact that the media storm provokes victim-blaming or is negative towards the victim is not the policy’s fault, but the product of the sexist values of that society and its media.
1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: Instead of focusing on the domestic violence, media and fans will focus on how the firing of the star player affected the player and their sport.
1.2.1.1.2.2.1. Pro: [Multiple](http://sports.mynorthwest.com/86467/charges-recommended-for-derrick-coleman-seahawks-rb-admits-to-smoking-synthetic-marijuana/) [fan](http://www.tmz.com/2015/04/21/detroit-lions-rodney-austin-arrest-assault-woman-baby/) [threads](http://www.mlive.com/wolverines/index.ssf/2015/05/frank_clark_discusses_domestic.html) can be found online showing fans defending Frank Clark, who openly admitted that he 'put \[his\] hands on' his girlfriend.
1.2.1.1.2.3. Pro: Where a victim is unwilling to participate in the media narrative around their abuse, they are unlikely to be a good advocate for the cause.
1.2.1.1.2.4. Con: Short term negative coverage can still be beneficial in the long run, as it generates responses from government and other actors.
1.2.1.1.2.4.1. Con: Short-term negative coverage can still be massively damaging to the victim and is therefore likely to be more harmful than helpful.
1.2.1.1.2.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.1.8.
1.2.1.1.2.5. Con: It is empirically untrue that all media outlets behave socially irresponsibly when reporting on these cases.
1.2.1.1.2.5.1. Pro: Different outlets are able to act as a check and balance on each other, mitigating some of the harms of bad reporting.
1.2.1.1.2.5.1.1. Pro: For example, [Gawker](http://gawker.com/5991003/cnn-reports-on-the-promising-future-of-the-steubenville-rapists-who-are-very-good-students) published an op-ed criticising CNN's handling of the Steubenville rape case.
1.2.1.1.2.5.2. Pro: Many outlets criticised the NFL's inaction in the Ray Rice case.
1.2.1.1.2.5.2.1. Pro: Even dedicated sports networks, such as [ESPN](http://time.com/3377200/espn-hannah-storm-ray-rice-elevator-video-nfl/), ran critical and emotional pieces on the case.
1.2.1.1.2.6. Con: If there is no discourse at all, then awareness of the problem will not spread and no progress will be made in preventing future instances of domestic abuse.
1.2.1.1.2.6.1. Con: A complete lack of awareness is preferable to the counter-productive awareness caused by media coverage.
1.2.1.1.2.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.1.7.
1.2.1.1.2.6.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.2.1.
1.2.1.1.2.6.1.3. Con: Social [awareness](http://ideas.ted.com/on-whyistayed-and-the-violence-against-women-act-20-years-later/) about domestic violence is key in eradicating it. Since in the US three women are [killed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/23/domestic-violence-statistics_n_5959776.html) every day by a current or former male partner and domestic violence is a primary cause of injury to women, it seems unlikely that some cases where the media engaged in victim-blaming and re-victimisation are a worse outcome than a [lack](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jefflanders/2012/12/05/domestic-violence-the-awareness-we-overlook/#6c643afc47e9) of awareness about it.
1.2.1.1.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.
1.2.1.1.2.8. Pro: The voices of individual victims will be drowned out by advocacy groups who are pushing their own agenda.
1.2.1.1.2.8.1. Con: Many advocacy groups are led by people who themselves have been victims of abuse, therefore they will have the victims' best interests at heart.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Regardless of how the coverage plays out, it forces fans to confront the issue, and their potential complicity in it.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: The media coverage that surrounds instances of alleged domestic and sexual violence committed by athletes is likely to reach audiences who wouldn't otherwise engage with these issues.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Sports clubs have a particularly wide reach, particularly at a [community level](http://www.smh.com.au/comment/football-has-an-important-role-to-play-in-tackling-domestic-violence-20150723-giisdl.html).
1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: When much of the coverage sympathizes with the abuser, the extent of its reach is irrelevant since it will not help spread awareness of the victims' plight.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.2.1.3. Pro: Often, it takes victims a long time to come out with allegations, if they report at all.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: For example, the first alleged sexual assault committed by [Ben Roethlisberger](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/221249-steelers-quarterback-ben-roethlisberger-hit-with-sexual-assault-lawsuit) was only reported a year after the fact.
1.2.2. Con: Media coverage of high-profile domestic/sexual assault cases involving athletes plays into harmful stereotypes about perpetrators of these crimes.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Due to the demographic makeup of sports leagues, perpetrators within them are overwhelmingly non-white. [This coverage plays into harmful biases about men of colour](https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/the-nfls-domestic-violence-problem-and-our-race-problem).
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: For example, it supports the notion that black men are hyper-sexual and/or aggressive.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: These men often have wives or partners who are also non-white. This coverage benefits them, as victims of colour are frequently ignored or dismissed in discourse around domestic and sexual violence.
1.2.2.1.3. Con: This isn't an issue with coverage of these cases, so much as a lack of coverage of other cases.
1.2.2.2. Con: This isn't always true. For example, the [Brittney Griner/Glory Johnson](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2479888-brittney-griner-glory-johnson-the-wnba-and-domestic-violence-in-lgbt-community) case shed light on domestic abuse in the LGBT community, something that is frequently ignored in mainstream discourse.
1.2.3. Con: Most of the discourse regarding this policy is [grandstanding](http://deadspin.com/zero-tolerance-for-domestic-violence-will-only-make-it-1787428167) without any consideration for how the victim feels about being thrust into the limelight.
1.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.1.
1.2.5. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.3. Pro: Punishments for domestic violence are handed out poorly and inequitably by leagues under status quo.
1.3.1. Pro: Often, the way that clubs punish players for alleged domestic or sexual violence is racist.
1.3.1.1. Con: If punishments are currently handed out in a racist way, judgements of guilt will likely be given in a racist way as well. Therefore, Zero-Tolerance policies will disproportionately hurt black players.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Any policy in U.S. professional sports leagues is likely to disproportionately affect black players since they make up the [majority](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/73113-a-history-of-african-american-athletes) of both the NBA \(approx. 80%\) and the NFL \(approx. 70%\).
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Even if this is true, the image it creates is one which perpetuates harmful stereotypes around Black men.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: To the extent to which guilt is a matter of potentially establishable fact, and therefore is less subjective than decisions about punishment, a Zero-Tolerance policy at least removes the most subjective - and therefore, the most susceptible to the influence of racism - elements from the picture.
1.3.1.2. Pro: Black athletes have historically been painted as ["angry, rebellious, violent, uncontrollable](https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/the-nfls-domestic-violence-problem-and-our-race-problem)" and with "questions of discipline"; therefore they tend to receive harsher punishments for infractions than white athletes do.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: For example, Ray Rice received a [harsher punishment, and a bigger public outcry](https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/the-nfls-domestic-violence-problem-and-our-race-problem) than Ben Roethlisberger.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Ray Rice was also caught [on camera](http://digg.com/video/tmz-releases-video-of-ray-rice-knocking-out-his-fiancee) committing an assault, while Ben Roethlisberger was not.
1.3.1.3. Con: The criminal justice system in the US is often racially [biased](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/24/researchers-have-discovered-a-surprising-racial-bias-in-the-criminal-justice-system/?utm_term=.682899af48d2) and punishes people of color more harshly. However, that does not mean those punishments need to be eliminated, but rather that racism needs to be acknowledged and eradicated.
1.3.1.4. Pro: In the most recent N.F.L. domestic violence scandal, white player [Josh Brown](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/10/20/hurley-josh-brown-revelations-prove-nfl-roger-goodell-dont-care-about-domestic-violence/) of the New York Giants was only suspended for 1 game for abusing his wife, while black players have received 4-16 game suspensions.
1.3.2. Pro: The degree of punishment a player receives is often lighter if they are considered key to their team's success.
1.3.2.1. Pro: Sports leagues invest [millions of dollars](http://mag.bleacherreport.com/nfl-domestic-violence-policy-suspensions/) in their players, and as such they will go to great lengths to keep those players around.
1.3.2.1.1. Con: If a coach or fellow player found out about the abuse, they would be less likely to report it under a Zero-Tolerance policy because that would be bad for the team.
1.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Team loyalty](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2003/oct/23/athletes_and_women/?print) is often valued above all else; therefore athletes who misbehave expect their teammates to either condone their behavior or at least keep it to themselves.
1.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Coaches and teammates are not the main reporters under the status quo, for the same reason as listed above. They shouldn't be considered important actors in this calculus.
1.3.2.2. Pro: Teams will still employ players with histories of non-domestic [violence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogergroves/2017/04/29/the-25-million-lesson-of-joe-mixon/#65a959f75baa) if their talents warrant the risk.
1.3.2.2.1. Pro: Since teams will only field players with violent histories when their talent outweighs the risks, this means that, over time, DV becomes glamorized or marginalized by being associated with talented and popular players.
1.3.2.2.1.1. Con: A Zero-Tolerance policy necessarily excludes athletes with a past which is violent towards women. It will therefore decrease glamorization of sexist attitudes.
1.3.2.2.2. Con: If teams are only willing to employ the very best athletes with violent pasts, then there will be significantly fewer violent athletes employed total.
1.3.2.2.3. Con: Having fewer violent players in the NFL is a good thing unto itself.
1.3.3. Pro: Sports leagues are notoriously poor at acting to protect women's rights.
1.3.3.1. Pro: For example the Australian Football League [allowed Wayne Carey, who was convicted of abusing his partner, to commentate on their White Ribbon match](http://www.mamamia.com.au/wayne-carey-domestic-violence/) - which sought to raise awareness for victims of domestic violence.
1.3.3.2. Pro: The NFL consistently enforces penalties for [touchdown celebrations](http://deadspin.com/roger-goodell-no-its-the-fans-who-are-idiots-1788088490), yet rarely punishes players for abusing a partner.
1.3.3.3. Con: The NFL runs an annual [Women Summit](http://www.nfl.com/womenssummit) to empower women.
1.3.4. Con: If leagues have already proven themselves to be poor decision makers, this will be exacerbated under a Zero-Tolerance policy where the stakes are higher.
1.3.4.1. Con: Higher stakes means more pressure to handle the situation properly. It is thus reasonable to assume that the introduction of Zero-Tolerance policy would provide an impetus for leagues to make better decisions.
1.3.4.2. Con: A Zero-Tolerance policy removes some of the responsibility from leagues to make decisions; once a player is caught, the punishment will always be the same.
1.3.5. Pro: Decisions handed down by sporting leagues at the moment are often perceived as politically motivated.
1.3.5.1. Pro: For example, many perceive the 'harsh' suspension that Adrian Peterson received as the NFL's way of responding to criticism of their [failure to adequately punish Ray Rice.](https://www.google.com.au/amp/www.nydailynews.com/amp/sports/football/adrian-peterson-child-abuse-suspension-unfair-article-1.2783232)
1.3.6. Con: Case-by-case discretion is necessary to reflect the complexity of these cases.
1.3.6.1. Pro: Zero-Tolerance policies are analogous to minimum sentencing laws, which have been [criticised](http://theconversation.com/mandatory-sentencing-leads-to-unjust-unfair-outcomes-it-doesnt-make-us-safe-52086) for their failure to account for mitigation.
1.3.6.2. Pro: Domestic violence is not a monolith. It is experienced by different people in different ways, and a singular policy like Zero-Tolerance fails to address that.
1.3.6.2.1. Pro: There are many reasons women choose not to report or prosecute domestic abuse, and even more as to why they wouldn't want to be involved in a high profile case.
1.3.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.2.
1.3.6.2.1.2. Pro: Having an instance of abuse committed against you be part of the public record would make it exceedingly difficult for victims of domestic abuse to move on with their lives after the fact.
1.3.6.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.4.
1.3.6.2.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.
1.3.6.2.1.5. Pro: Some victims, for whatever reason, might want to forgive their abuser. We should allow them that perogative.
1.3.6.2.1.5.1. Con: Many victims forgive their abuser because they put their abuser's career before their own well-being. This is not a positive attitude to cultivate.
1.3.6.2.1.5.2. Con: In the same way that victims can forgive a criminal who committed a crime against them or their loved ones, victims of domestic violence can forgive their abusers, yet that does not exempt offenders from receiving punishment.
1.3.7. Pro: Since the inception of Commissioner Goodell's ["baseline" six-game suspension policy](http://mag.bleacherreport.com/nfl-domestic-violence-policy-suspensions/) for abusive athletes, it has only been enforced against two of eighteen players publicly linked to domestic violence allegations.
1.3.8. Pro: The league's most powerful owners often enjoy [preferential protection](http://www.espn.com.au/nfl/story/_/id/17856040/owners-concerned-nfl-handling-josh-brown-new-york-giants) from league discipline.
1.3.9. Con: In 2012, the Geelong Football Club [banned](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/afl/geelong-cats-player-jesse-stringer-banned-for-rest-of-2012/news-story/167c8e0671f502652ec136814797944d) player Jesse Stringer from senior level matches due to domestic violence committed against his girlfriend. This sent a message to the player group and wider community that domestic violence is unacceptable.
1.4. Con: A Zero-Tolerance policy will lead to less league-wide reform on issues of domestic and sexual violence.
1.4.1. Pro: Clubs create the conditions \(e.g. a culture of hegemonic masculinity, normalised sexual and sexist language, increased tolerance of violence\), which make players more likely to commit these acts in the first place.
1.4.1.1. Pro: If we consider the culture of [hegemonic masculinity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemonic_masculinity) that clubs create as being causative of instances of abuse, that meaningfully reduces the culpability of individual players.
1.4.1.1.1. Pro: The fact that domestic violence is such a problem across [multiple](http://www.vocativ.com/culture/sport/nfl-arrest-rates/) sporting codes suggests an element of [cultural coercion](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10261133.1996.9674040?needAccess=true&journalCode=rwle19), which means people who would not otherwise be emboldened to commit these crimes do so in a sporting context.
1.4.1.1.2. Con: Since [violence](http://jump.eu.com/sexism-fuels-violence-women/) against women is often the by-product of sexism and hegemonic masculinity, that argument would exonerate any abuser.
1.4.1.2. Pro: Professional sport increases athletes' propensity for sexual violence in several ways, for example the sexualisation of women by sporting leagues \([Dyson and Flood, p. 11](https://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/media-and-resources/publications/building-cultures-of-respect-and-non-violence)\). Leagues are just as responsible, if not more responsible, for these factors as players are.
1.4.1.3. Con: All the more reason for clubs to acknowledge their responsibility and to be the first ones to try to change these circumstances by implementing a Zero-Tolerance policy.
1.4.2. Con: A Zero-Tolerance policy is in and of itself a league-wide reform.
1.4.3. Con: Clubs will have a strong incentive not to lose players under this policy, and are therefore more likely to invest in programs that target prevention.
1.4.3.1. Pro: Under the status quo, individual clubs do not have any incentive to prevent violence, because it is rarely prosecuted in the courts and leagues only give players a 'slap on the wrist'.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: An incentive for clubs to prevent violence aside from the policy proposed is that poor publicity based on player behaviour impacts the ability of the sporting team to obtain and continue corporate sponsorship.
1.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: In Australia, Holden[threatened](http://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/eddie-mcguires-actions-result-in-collingwood-sponsor-threatening-to-walk-away/news-story/15b361965cc15a07424afcdaa816a2a7) to withdraw sponsorship of Collingwood based on statements made by the President Eddie McGuire about holding a female journalist underwater. Ultimately, they did not withdraw sponsorship but the negative publicity was harmful to the sponsorship relationship.
1.4.3.1.1.2. Con: Given this is the status quo, and domestic and sexual violence remain endemic, it is clearly ineffective.
1.4.4. Pro: By blaming individual players, rather than taking collective responsibility for a culture which encourages abuse, leagues shift the blame away from themselves.
1.4.4.1. Pro: By shifting the focus in this way, clubs and leagues are less likely to look inwards for a solution to the violence problem, and less likely to be subject to public scrutiny.
1.4.4.1.1. Pro: Instead of being proactive, leagues focus their initiatives on player suspensions, resisting calls to [bar](https://thinkprogress.org/after-drafting-player-with-a-history-of-domestic-abuse-charges-chiefs-ask-fans-to-trust-decision-c56aecc2b810) players with violent histories from being drafted, as were [five](http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/news/nfl-draft-picks-domestic-violence-joe-mixon-conley-westbrook-brantley/ff1hhe4ypm6g18gv2tdv6zv58) of them in the 2017 N.F.L. draft.
1.4.4.1.2. Pro: Clubs receive no direct penalties when players commit violent crimes, are excused from having to pay the suspended player's salary, and enjoy [salary cap](http://steelerswire.usatoday.com/2016/03/12/the-salary-cap-implications-of-a-suspension-for-martavis-bryant/) relief for the duration of the suspension.
1.4.4.2. Con: Zero-Tolerance policies do not only affect individual players, but also the team and the league as a whole. This surely cannot be seen as an attempt to shift responsibility away from the league.
1.4.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.
1.4.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.2.1.4.5.
1.5. Con: Leagues should defer to law enforcement.
1.5.1. Pro: It is not the leagues' place to determine legal culpability.
1.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.
1.5.1.2. Pro: The legal system has a number of complex checks and balances on the rights of both victims and accused. When private actors seek to adjudicate complex cases such as alleged sexual and domestic violence without such protection, they are likely to do so in inconsistent and harmful ways.
1.5.1.2.1. Con: Given the accused is not losing a fundamental right \(e.g. their liberty\) the standard of investigation need not be so high or thorough.
1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: The right to choose a profession is a fundamental right spelled out in [Art 6](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
1.5.1.3. Pro: A job in athletics is a job like any other. Since most professions do not have Zero-Tolerance policies, sports leagues should not either.
1.5.1.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1.
1.5.1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.5.1.3.3. Con: Some jobs, e.g. [attorneys](https://www.americanbar.org/publications/syllabus_home/volume_44_2012-2013/winter_2012-2013/professionalism_whatdoesittaketosatisfychracterandfitnessrequire.html), have regulatory boards that can revoke a person's right to engage in that profession for committing a crime.
1.5.1.3.3.1. Con: There is no regulatory or oversight body for professional sports.
1.5.1.3.3.1.1. Con: Most sports leagues have codes of conduct which players are bound to. These often include an obligation to uphold the integrity of the league; criminal or abusive actions undeniably violate such clauses.
1.5.1.3.3.1.2. Con: Even if it is true that there is no league oversight, that does not mean that there should not be. Zero-Tolerance policies are an example of where such oversight is missing.
1.5.1.3.3.1.3. Con: The league acts as a regulatory body for individual clubs. They are therefore justified in implementing conduct-based policies.
1.5.1.3.3.2. Pro: These boards, such as the [Character and Fitness Committee](https://www.americanbar.org/publications/syllabus_home/volume_44_2012-2013/winter_2012-2013/professionalism_whatdoesittaketosatisfychracterandfitnessrequire.html) in the legal profession, look into whether the person has the ethical and/or moral integrity to be a suitable representative of that profession.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1. Con: It is preferable for society if our underlying assumptions are that people can grow and rehabilitate themselves.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.1. Pro: If people know that they will always be judged by their worst day, they have no incentive or reason to improve.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.1.1. Con: If people believe that they can escape judgement for their worst actions, they are likely to commit these actions again.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: When banned for gambling, MLB player Pete Rose [said](http://mlb.nbcsports.com/2013/08/12/pete-rose-i-should-have-picked-alcohol-or-i-should-have-picked-up-beating-up-my-wife-or-girlfriend/) "I picked the wrong vice...I should have picked beating up my wife or girlfriend" because that often goes unpunished.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.1.2. Con: Some people want to improve for the simple pleasure of being a better person.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.1.3. Con: Most people's 'worst day' would not entail committing domestic or sexual violence.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.1.4. Con: If people know that they will always be judged by their worst day, they will likely make a greater effort to prevent that day from happening.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.1.5. Con: Domestic violence is very rarely a [one-time](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a31528/14-misconceptions-about-domestic-violence/) incident, but rather a [pattern](http://ncadv.org/learn-more/what-is-domestic-violence/dynamics-of-abuse) of behaviour in which the abuser exerts power and control over the victim. Therefore to categorise it generally as a 'worst day' scenario is not accurate.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.2. Pro: If we as a society are welcoming and forgiving, more people will want to embrace society's norms and values.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.2.1. Con: Society's values are meaningless if we fail to protect vulnerable people from abuse.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.2.2. Con: People will not want to embrace the values of a society that does not punish a crime as damaging as domestic abuse.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.3. Pro: Generally, people are nuanced. No one is exclusively evil or exclusively good.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.3.1. Con: Domestic and sexual violence are particularly heinous crimes precisely because they are completely dehumanising for victims. To deny those victims justice in order to recognise the 'nuance' of the offender's personality is reprehensible.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.3.1.1. Con: "Justice" does not inherently mean the perpetrator loses their career.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.3.1.2. Con: A Zero-Tolerance policy will not necessarily give justice to victims since the lack of nuance ultimately leaves them with no say in the process.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.4. Con: It is preferable for society, and particularly vulnerable groups within society, that we recognise their systemic victimisation and protect them from abuse.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.1.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.6. Pro: A permanent ban implies that the person cannot be rehabilitated.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.6.1. Con: A person can be rehabilitated, but also has to live with permanent consequences for their actions. The fact that they are unlikely to commit violent acts again doesn't mitigate their past actions nor the harm those created.
1.5.1.3.3.2.1.6.2. Con: Someone who lost their job under a Zero-Tolerance policy could still seek counseling, education and other support should they want to rehabilitate themselves.
1.5.1.3.4. Pro: Too often, people view athletics as something other than a business, which leads to things like criticism of players who leave their teams for more money.
1.5.1.3.4.1. Pro: Many people view athletes not as workers, but as [overpaid people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hank-koebler/debunking-the-greedy-play_b_906400.html) playing a kid's game.
1.5.1.3.4.1.1. Con: On the contrary, the perception of sportspeople as 'overgrown children' leads to a 'boys will be boys' mentality, where they aren't held to account for their actions. A Zero-Tolerance policy remedies this.
1.5.1.3.4.1.2. Pro: This leads to people siding with management in labor disputes, effectively denying the athletes rights and benefits.
1.5.1.3.4.2. Con: Employers generally have the discretion to fire employees where their behaviour outside the work environment can compromise the company's image. This is no different.
1.5.1.3.4.2.1. Pro: For example, workers can be fired [based on the content of their personal social media pages](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/08/25/when-you-can-and-cant-fire-employees-for-social-media-misbehavior/#5a09644e73b1).
1.5.1.3.4.2.2. Pro: Increasingly, [feminists are referring online misogyny to employers](http://www.smh.com.au/national/hotel-worker-michael-nolan-sacked-over-facebook-post-to-clementine-ford-20151130-glc1y4.html), which often leads to the employee's termination.
1.5.1.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.3.
1.5.1.3.6. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.4.2.
1.5.1.3.7. Con: There are in fact many [businesses](https://hbr.org/2006/11/the-reign-of-zero-tolerance) throughout the U.S. that do utilize Zero-Tolerance policies for high-level infractions.
1.5.1.3.8. Con: Introducing Zero-Tolerance policies in athletics might prompt other industries to do the same, which could help prevent domestic violence throughout the workforce.
1.5.1.3.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.5.1.3.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.
1.5.1.3.10. Con: Many businesses not only mandate that their employees are trained in sexual harassment/assault prevention, but will also [follow up](http://www.workplacefairness.org/sexual-harassment-practical-strategies) with investigation, mediation, and punishment if an incident arises. It is not unreasonable to hold sports leagues to this same standard.
1.5.1.3.10.1. Con: A Zero-Tolerance policy would go far beyond that same standard. We do not expect businesses to fire anyone who has committed an act of violence.
1.5.1.3.10.1.1. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.7.
1.5.1.4. Pro: When an alleged suspect is arrested for domestic violence by the police, the league can be sure actions are being taken.
1.5.1.4.1. Pro: Charges can be dropped after an arrest for a variety of reasons \(e.g. for the victim's best interest or insufficient evidence\). We should have faith in the nuance of the legal system to decide on an appropriate course of action.
1.5.1.5. Con: Any changes to league discipline policy would have to be collectively bargained, so the players would have granted leagues the right to make such a determination.
1.5.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.
1.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.
1.5.4. Con: Due to low rates of successful prosecution, the state is often hesitant to take cases of domestic and sexual violence to trial.
1.5.4.1. Pro: The Rape Abuse and Incest National Network \(RAINN\) report that only [13 of every 1000](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-expect-criminal-justice-system) rapes are referred to a prosecutor.
1.5.4.2. Pro: [8 out of 10](https://www.abqjournal.com/news/metro/344905metro05-01-05.htm) domestic violence cases are dismissed before going to trial.
1.5.4.3. Con: Leagues will be far more hesitant to act on cases of domestic violence under a Zero-Tolerance policy, since doing so could lose them some of their best players.
1.5.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.3.
1.5.5. Pro: Leagues' financial incentives are a conflict of interest; they therefore cannot be impartial adjudicators in these cases.
1.5.5.1. Pro: Commissioners of most sports leagues are elected by the owners of the the league's franchises, and can be replaced if enough franchises deem the commissioner's discipline detrimental to their interests. Such an arrangement discourages broad implementation of harsh punishment [\(Noll, p. 22/23\)](http://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/02-43_0.pdf).
1.5.5.1.1. Con: Neutral arbitration allows the league to implement Zero Tolerance by circumventing the commissioner's office and avoiding conflict of interest.
1.5.5.1.1.1. Con: Leagues have proven themselves able to influence the appointment of arbiters of disciplinary hearings, even going so far as to appoint the [commissioner](http://musketfire.com/2015/05/23/deflategate-demaurice-smith-doesnt-like-roger-goodell-as-arbiter-of-nflpa-appeal/) as the arbiter.
1.5.5.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.8.
1.5.6. Con: Most domestic violence policy is grounded in the [stereotype](http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?params=/context/law_journal_law_policy/article/1093/&path_info=) of a victim who is white, straight, middle-class, weak, and dependent; and when a victim doesn't conform to this idea, it often undermines their credibility. A Zero-Tolerance policy offers justice to those marginalized victims by taking every instance of domestic abuse equally seriously.
1.5.6.1. Con: If this is true, there is no reason to believe these 'imperfect victims' will not be denied justice altogether under a Zero-Tolerance policy.
1.5.7. Pro: A Zero-Tolerance policy has the potential to bias legal proceedings.
1.5.7.1. Pro: If a player is first fired under a Zero-Tolerance policy, and then prosecuted in criminal proceedings, the jury will likely be biased by the fact that they have already been labelled as guilty by their league.
1.5.7.2. Con: Under status quo, legal proceedings are biased towards athletes, who can use their star power to woo the jury. In choosing between two unequal options, we should choose the one which favors the most vulnerable party: in this case, the victim.
1.5.7.2.1. Con: This violates the [presumption of innocence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence), which is fundamental to liberal democracies.
1.5.7.2.1.1. Con: Outside of the criminal justice system, the presumption of innocence is an irrelevant principle. For example, what must be proved in domestic arbitrations between parties or commercial disputes between parties has a lower standard of proof.
1.5.7.2.2. Pro: False accusations of domestic and sexual violence are [extremely rare](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/13/false-allegations-rape-domestic-violence-rare). Favouring the victim is therefore more likely to result in a just verdict.
1.5.8. Con: As leagues do not violate any laws by suspending violent players they are deferring to law enforcement even when implementing a zero-tolerance policy.
1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.2.1.
1.7. Pro: Leagues have an obligation to take strong action against domestic violence.
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.7.2. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.7.3. Con: Zero-Tolerance policies are not in the league's best interest, which should be their primary concern.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Permanently losing skilled players to one-time infractions is not in the leagues' best interest, as viewership could decrease.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.3.2.
1.7.3.1.2. Pro: Fans often form particular attachments to certain players and might stop watching the sport in protest should that player be banned from the league.
1.7.3.1.3. Pro: If highly-skilled players are removed, then the quality of the affected teams might decrease; and if the quality of the game decreases, then people might lose interest in watching.
1.7.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.
1.7.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.2.1.3.
1.7.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.7.5. Con: Leagues already educate both athletes and the general public on issues around domestic violence. This should be enough to discharge any moral burden on them.
1.7.5.1. Pro: For example, [NFL training camps](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/07/27/domestic-violence-training-education-drunk-driving-intervention/30752175/) include seminars on domestic and sexual violence.
1.7.5.1.1. Con: According to [feedback](http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/5/6/8209087/nfl-domestic-violence-training-presentation-nflpa) from players, these training sessions have been largely ineffective due to a disconnect between the intended message and the audience receiving it. This is in part because the seminars are blanket-taught to everyone in the same way without taking into account cultural differences or variation in upbringing.
1.7.5.2. Pro: For example, the Australian Football League \(AFL\) runs the '[Respectful Relationships](http://www.afl.com.au/afleducation/respect)' program which aims to educate the community on domestic violence.
1.7.5.3. Con: If these programs already exist and yet the problem with abuse remains, they are clearly insufficient.
1.7.5.4. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.10.
1.7.5.5. Con: If anything, the fact that leagues are positioning themselves as experts on the issue should put more of a burden on them to 'practice what they preach'.
1.7.6. Pro: Sports leagues have a causative role in the high instance of domestic and sexual violence among athletes.
1.7.6.1. Pro: Many sports promote cultures of [hegemonic masculinity](https://medium.com/\@sarahlerner/male-athletes-may-insist-otherwise-but-locker-rooms-are-filled-with-toxic-masculinity-cc2a01cf678). Thus, the leagues must do something to combat the harmful impacts of the cultures they foster.
1.7.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.7.6.1.2. Pro: Athletes are led to believe they are entitled to women's bodies.
1.7.6.1.2.1. Pro: One sports publicist [wrote](http://deadspin.com/5914355/how-women-throw-themselves-at-pro-athletes-and-vice-versa-a-publicist-explains), "No woman is off-limits for a sports figure." This pervasive attitude objectifies women, which in turn makes violence against them more likely.
1.7.6.1.2.2. Pro: Athletes have been known to pass women around like toys amongst their teammates [\(Pappas, p. 162\)](https://books.google.com/books?id=29u8P6oReXUC&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=women+taking+advantage+of+sports+players&source=bl&ots=PbbEEAIPRg&sig=5NKpJyZ8hm1ij1KQ187IUAiRJ9s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3jcnh27vSAhVCwxQKHYyGAR0Q6AEIWzAO#v=onepage&q=women%20taking%20advantage%20of%20sports%20players&f=false).
1.7.6.1.2.3. Pro: Athletes sometimes use their fame and power to manipulate women. Leagues need to make it clear that such behavior is unacceptable [\(The Dark Side of Sports, p. 162\)](https://books.google.com/books?id=29u8P6oReXUC&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=women+taking+advantage+of+sports+players&source=bl&ots=PbbEEAIPRg&sig=5NKpJyZ8hm1ij1KQ187IUAiRJ9s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3jcnh27vSAhVCwxQKHYyGAR0Q6AEIWzAO#v=onepage&q=women%20taking%20advantage%20of%20sports%20players&f=false).
1.7.6.1.3. Pro: Cross-cultural [studies](https://sapac.umich.edu/article/196) of rape have shown that all-male membership groups such as a sports teams or fraternities are a highly contributing factor to sexual violence.
1.7.6.1.3.1. Pro: When men are taught to be aggressive and dominant, as they usually are in sports, it often [leads to](https://sapac.umich.edu/article/196) hyper-masculinity, antagonistic sexual beliefs, and male peer support for sexual aggression.
1.7.6.1.3.2. Pro: Sexism is able to run rampant in homosocial environments, because there are no, or very few, women present to defend themselves and put a human face to degrading comments.
1.7.6.1.4. Pro: Contact sports erode the boundaries which most people observe with respect to unwanted or aggressive physical contact. Sports leagues must reinforce those boundaries.
1.7.6.1.4.1. Con: Any causal link between contact sports and criminal violence is speculative. Many other factors influence propensities towards criminal violence.
1.7.6.1.4.1.1. Pro: Physical contact in the NBA is less violent than in the [NHL](http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/01/many-argue-that-fighting-is-a-necessary-part-of-professional-hockey/), yet professional basketball players are far more likely to be [arrested](http://www.vocativ.com/culture/sport/nfl-arrest-rates/) for violent crimes than hockey players.
1.7.6.1.4.2. Con: Professional athletes' violent acts outside the boundaries of play are far more likely to be documented than the general public because of their celebrity, leading to increased scrutiny and potential confirmation bias.
1.7.6.1.5. Pro: Athletes are conditioned to dehumanise their opposition in order to increase their chances of winning. Sports clubs are directly complicit when this trickles into their off-field life.
1.7.6.1.5.1. Pro: This is especially true in American Football, which is awash in violent [military metaphors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIkqNiBASfI).
1.7.6.1.5.2. Pro: Since players are trained to be particularly aggressive, it can be [difficult](http://deadspin.com/leave-janay-rice-out-of-her-husbands-bullshit-redemptio-1697717292) for them to switch that aggression off in other aspects of their lives.
1.7.6.1.5.2.1. Con: However, players generally seems able to not direct that aggression towards other figures such as coaches, other players or club owners.
1.7.6.1.5.3. Con: Sport clubs cannot change their training because if they do they will lose against clubs that do not.
1.7.6.1.5.4. Con: Players are much more likely to be part of many teams throughout their careers \(in-league and in international competition\), leading to lasting friendships with their opponents. This leads to the opposite effect, which is greater humanization of opponents over time.
1.7.6.1.6. Pro: Many sports clubs have off-field rituals or traditions which are demeaning to women, like forcing rookies to wear [women's clothing](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/sports/baseball/mlb-rookie-hazing-women-costumes.html).
1.7.6.2. Pro: Many athletes take steroids to succeed in their sport. Steroids can lead to "[roid rage](http://www.anabolicsteroids.net/roid-rage.php)," incidents of extreme anger that have been linked to [numerous incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Benoit_double-murder_and_suicide) of violence.
1.7.6.2.1. Con: The use of steroids in sport is illegal and individual players are often banned for it. Leagues cannot be held responsible for the illegal actions of individual players.
1.7.6.2.1.1. Pro: By this same logic, leagues cannot be held responsible for individual players who carry out illegal violent or abusive acts. Therefore sports leagues have no obligation to implement Zero-Tolerance policies.
1.7.6.2.1.1.1. Con: Given that leagues ban players for some illegal actions, such as the use of drugs, they have an obligation to extend that principle to domestic violence since it is much more harmful to society.
1.7.6.2.1.2. Con: Frequently, the use of performance-enhancing drugs is [conveniently ignored](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17246535) by officials capitalizing on increased performance for monetary gain.
1.7.6.3. Con: If this is true, then it is unfair for sports leagues to punish individual athletes for crimes with a shared responsibility.
1.7.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.
1.7.8. Pro: League violence prevention initiatives are little more than disingenuous [public relations](http://deadspin.com/do-the-nfls-anti-domestic-violence-initiatives-actually-1682681513) stunts until paired with the tangible action that has been [promised](http://www.latimes.com/la-sp-nfl-letter-domestic-violence-story.html).
1.8. Con: Zero-Tolerance policies are unfair to athletes.
1.8.1. Pro: A Zero-Tolerance policy would make an athlete more susceptible to blackmail/extortion, as they would have more to lose and thus would be more willing to pay to make an accusation go away.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Zero-Tolerance policies inherently favor the accuser, however it is entirely plausible that the accuser is lying.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Public tendency to [overestimate false reports](http://harvardjsel.com/2015/07/bethany-withers-without-consequence/#_ftn68) can inject bias into an investigation by giving more credibility to the accused.
1.8.1.1.2. Con: Studies report that false rape accusations only range between 2%-8% [\(Lonsway, p. 2\)](http://ndaa.org/pdf/the_voice_vol_3_no_1_2009.pdf).
1.8.1.1.3. Pro: Professional sports has an undeniable ["groupie"](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2003/oct/23/athletes_and_women/?print) culture, therefore more precautions should be taken to protect athletes from people who try to take advantage of them.
1.8.1.1.3.1. Con: The source mentions nothing of groupies taking advantage of athletes, only that athletes' own promiscuity can be risky for their reputation.
1.8.1.1.3.1.1. Con: Although athletes' promiscuity is often the catalyst for disaster, the [source](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2003/oct/23/athletes_and_women/?print) clearly states that athletes need to beware of "groupies poking holes in condoms" and "having hidden cameras" - both of which are pathways to extortion/blackmail.
1.8.1.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: These issues are serious enough that the FBI reportedly began investigating one [scam](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2003/oct/23/athletes_and_women/?print) in particular wherein "a woman poses as a groupie, slips a drug into an athlete's drink, goes to his room, he passes out, then she takes compromising photos of him -- sometimes with a male accomplice."
1.8.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: An athlete who has been drugged is unlikely to also be accused of abuse. If these scams are well known, it is unlikely they'll mistakenly fall under a Zero-Tolerance policy.
1.8.1.1.3.1.1.2. Con: These sources of blackmail operate independent of a Zero-Tolerance policy. There's no obvious reason they would increase under it.
1.8.1.1.3.2. Con: There already exists a high level of public skepticism around sexual or domestic violence claims made against famous athletes. These are likely to be compounded when the accuser is a groupie. Zero-Tolerance shouldn't be seen as giving them disproportionate power.
1.8.1.2. Con: Due to the fame and increased social status that their job affords them, athletes almost always have more leverage than their partners.
1.8.1.2.1. Pro: For example, in order to justify a lighter punishment for Ray Rice, the NFL and Baltimore Ravens coerced Janay Rice into [apologising for her own victimisation.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/janay-rice-ravens-suggested-apology_n_6248954)
1.8.1.2.1.1. Con: This cover up would not have happened under a Zero-Tolerance policy. The Baltimore Ravens used the apology as a mitigating factor in decreasing Rice's punishment. Under a Zero-Tolerance policy, he would have been fired either way.
1.8.1.2.1.2. Pro: The idea that a women can be complicit in her own victimisation is hugely harmful, and plays into victim-blaming narratives.
1.8.1.3. Con: Given that any claims made under a Zero-Tolerance policy would be subject to thorough investigation, it seems unlikely that athletes would have anything to fear if they weren't in the wrong.
1.8.1.4. Con: Under the status quo professional athletes can already be targets of blackmail or [extortion](http://www.thesportster.com/entertainment/15-athletes-who-were-victims-of-extortion/), as they would prefer to pay to cover something up than to taint their image and lose advertisement contracts.
1.8.2. Pro: Athletes who commit different violent crimes or other criminal acts do not lose their jobs as a result.
1.8.2.1. Pro: There are many examples of athletes being involved in [organised crime](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11623314), but these are not given the same level of scrutiny as domestic and sexual assaults.
1.8.2.1.1. Pro: In the early 2000s, many members of the [West Coast Eagles](https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2016/april/1459429200/martin-mckenzie-murray/west-coast-boys-done-bad) AFL team were widely known to have ties to organised crime, but allowed to continue playing.
1.8.2.2. Con: [Many athletes](http://www.biography.com/news/a-rod-suspension-banned-athletes) have been banned for criminal offences such as gambling or violent assaults. The scale of punishment for domestic violence is far too low, and should be raised.
1.8.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.3.2.1.1.1.1.
1.8.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.2.
1.8.2.3. Pro: In 2015, 132 [active](https://www.aol.com/article/2015/09/15/27-active-nfl-players-who-have-been-arrested-multiple-times/21236263/) NFL players had been arrested multiple times.
1.8.2.4. Con: To the extent to which they don't, perhaps they should.
1.8.3. Con: In the status quo, athletes benefit from a system that is unfair to victims. Zero-Tolerance just corrects that existing imbalance.
1.8.3.1. Con: Zero tolerance relates only to an athlete's workplace discipline. League policy has no effect on a victim's ability to pursue legal action against their abuser.
1.8.4. Con: Athletes are provided many special affordances and privileges in society. In this case, therefore, it is comparatively better to be unfair to athletes than to victims of domestic and sexual violence.
1.8.4.1. Con: -> See 1.8.3.1.
1.8.4.2. Con: An athlete's social standing does not necessarily influence legal proceedings.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: While the social standing of an athlete may or may not help in front of a jury, if the case goes to trial, the access to [resources](https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/two-in-one-differences-in-the-us-justice-system-for-the-rich-and-the-poor) that highly-paid athletes have are a considerable advantage in the US criminal system.
1.8.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.2.
1.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.8.6. Pro: Banning a player removes them from their tight-knit community of friends and mentors, which could lead to a sense of alienation.
1.8.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.6.1.
1.8.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.8.8. Pro: Athlete domestic violence is an issue which begins at [the amateur level](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/02/09/baylor-not-alone-shielding-athletes-accused-misconduct-punishment). To introduce such harsh punishments only at the professional level as opposed to a coherent plan to combat violence at the amateur level as well would be unfair, incomplete, and ultimately ineffective.
1.9. Pro: Athletes ought be held to a higher standard than other employees.
1.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.5.
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.
1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.3.
1.9.4. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.3.1.
1.9.5. Pro: Athletes' private lives are matters of public interest.
1.9.5.1. Pro: When athletes indiscretions are widely broadcast, they do vast amounts of damage to their employers' reputations.
1.9.5.1.1. Pro: For example, Ben Cousin's well-publicised drug issues while he was playing AFL eventually led to a 12 month suspension for '[bringing the game into disrepute](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/ben-cousins-banned-for-12-months/news-story/7abefb11e2de120b07042c634c45b36f)'.
1.9.5.1.2. Pro: Two Australian NRL teams, the Cronulla Sharks and the Sydney Roosters, lost over [$1 million](http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/sharks/infinity-group-australia-withdraws-sharks-roosters-sponsorship-deal/news-story/12584f69de65d37eb7bb7fa20c003907) in sponsorship after some of their players were embroiled in a drug scandal.
1.9.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.3.2.
1.9.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1.2.
1.10. Con: Rehabilitation is preferable to punishment.
1.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.3.2.1.
1.10.2. Con: Rehabilitation isn't mutually exclusive with punishment. In order to rehabilitate and fully function within society, people need to understand that actions have consequences.
1.10.2.1. Pro: In this context, a lifetime ban recognises that the hyper-competitive and aggressive nature of professional sport is likely counter-productive to the rehabilitation of someone struggling with violent impulses.
1.10.2.2. Con: Although accountability is undeniably important, so is the goal of changing an abuser's behaviors. Implementing a Zero-Tolerance policy heavily suggests that the former outweighs the latter, which relegates rehabilitation to a mere afterthought.
1.10.2.3. Con: -> See 1.5.1.3.3.2.1.6.
1.10.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.1.3.3.2.1.6.2.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.10.4. Pro: Athletes who commit domestic and sexual violence are often only aggressive as a product of their circumstances, as opposed to an inherent character flaw.
1.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.1.3.
1.10.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.10.4.3. Con: The majority of players still manage not to be abusive off the field. Thus there is obviously at least some degree of personal responsibility that ought be acknowledged.
1.10.4.4. Con: If the circumstances are so bad, it would seem necessary to remove the player from them \(i.e. ban them from the league\) in order to achieve any kind of meaningful rehabilitation.
1.10.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.6.
1.10.6. Con: [Data](http://www.academia.edu/21737049/A_Critical_Analysis_of_Rehabilitation_Programs_for_Domestic_Violence_Perpetrators_In_Mauritius) gathered from treatment programs shows that many abusers are unable to be rehabilitated.
1.10.6.1. Pro: One study found that there was only a 5% decreased rate in repeat offenses for abusers who had completed intervention programs [\(Boolaky, p. 13\)](http://www.academia.edu/21737049/A_Critical_Analysis_of_Rehabilitation_Programs_for_Domestic_Violence_Perpetrators_In_Mauritius).
1.10.6.2. Pro: According to the co-founder of Safe Horizons, one of the country's largest organizations for assisting domestic violence victims, rehabilitation programs ["are best for accountability, not reform."](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/nfl-controversy/why-domestic-violence-prevention-programs-dont-work-n217346)
1.10.6.3. Pro: Education, a key aspect of rehabilitation, has been proven [ineffective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3395941/) in reducing the incidence of domestic and sexual violence.
1.10.6.4. Con: Some studies have shown that [60-70%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/domestic-abusers-can-reform-studies-show-1410822557) of abusive men who complete batterer treatment programs are capable of reform.
1.10.6.4.1. Con: That still leaves 30-40% of men who are not able to be rehabilitated. They should not get off without punishment.
1.10.6.4.2. Con: Treatment is unlikely to be effective if these players are still fully focused on and committed to a professional sporting job.
1.10.6.4.2.1. Pro: As the player's employer, clubs and leagues have a conflict of interest which could lead to them to make decisions that aren't in the best interests of long term rehabilitation.
1.10.6.4.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.6.
1.10.6.4.3. Pro: A [study from Durham](https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=23319) found that the vast majority of those who attended a domestic violence perpetrator programme did not reoffend.
1.10.7. Pro: There is less incentive to engage with rehabilitation programs when punishments are absolute.
1.10.7.1. Pro: Leagues and clubs could make employment conditional on issuing a public apology, or completing education/rehabilitation programs.
1.10.7.1.1. Con: A public apology is an empty gesture, as it does nothing to either help the victim nor prevent the abuser from hurting others. Employment should only be conditional on the grounds that actual steps are taken to address the abuser's problem.
1.10.7.1.1.1. Con: Even these stricter conditions are excluded under Zero-Tolerance, as the player has no possibility of regaining their job.
1.10.7.1.1.2. Con: Genuine apologies can have a great amount of social impact, and shouldn't be underestimated.
1.10.8. Con: Leagues are not necessarily well positioned to provide players with rehabilitation.
1.10.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.1.2.
1.10.8.2. Con: Leagues can encourage players to enter rehabilitation without providing it directly, but the harsh punishment of a Zero-Tolerance policy would likely disincentivise the player from entering rehabilitation because they now have nothing to gain from it.
1.10.8.2.1. Con: If players are only engaging with rehabilitation in order to retain their jobs, as opposed to recognising an inherent need to change, they are unlikely to meaningfully gain from it.
1.10.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.10.6.4.2.1.
1.10.9. Pro: -> See 1.10.6.4.
1.10.10. Pro: BU scientists have found [links](http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/study-cte-linked-domestic-violence-article-1.1978936) between domestic violence and the brain trauma endemic to American football players. Treatment of this [CTE](http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/14972296/top-nfl-official-acknowledges-link-football-related-head-trauma-cte-first) would be preferable to a lifetime ban and denial of medical benefits.
1.11. Pro: Zero-Tolerance policies are the most effective way to protect present and future victims from abuse.
1.11.1. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.5.
1.11.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.5.
1.11.4. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.
1.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.6.
1.11.6. Con: Zero-Tolerance policies are harmful to victims of domestic and sexual violence.
1.11.6.1. Con: The media coverage which accompanies the application of a Zero-Tolerance policy can connect victims with support services.
1.11.6.1.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.1.
1.11.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.11.6.3. Pro: A Zero-Tolerance policy makes victims of domestic and sexual violence less likely to receive justice.
1.11.6.3.1. Pro: When victims do come forward, a Zero-Tolerance policy makes players, clubs and leagues more likely to deny that domestic violence occurred, as opposed to offering an apology and reaching a constructive solution.
1.11.6.3.1.1. Pro: The higher stakes will mean players are less likely to admit their mistakes, resulting in their victim being denied justice.
1.11.6.3.1.1.1. Pro: There is still the threat of legal, professional and reputational harm as a result of confessing to these crimes. It is therefore unlikely that players will meaningfully own up to their indiscretions.
1.11.6.3.1.1.2. Con: It is unlikely that a player would admit their mistakes either way, given they could face criminal charges for domestic violence.
1.11.6.3.1.2. Con: Under the status quo, the apologies offered by athletes are normally insincere and tokenistic.
1.11.6.3.1.2.1. Con: This is still undeniably better than an abject denial of any harm occurring.
1.11.6.3.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.3.1.1.1.
1.11.6.3.1.2.3. Pro: For example, [Ray Rice](http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bal-ray-rice-issues-statement-thanking-ravens-baltimore-apologizes-for-domesticviolence-incident-20150212-story.html) issued a statement where he apologised to his club and his fans, but not his fiancée, who he abused.
1.11.6.3.1.3. Con: Even if slightly fewer people are judged as 'guilty' under a Zero-Tolerance policy, the fact that those who are receive substantial and meaningful punishments is still an improvement on the status quo.
1.11.6.3.1.4. Pro: In these instances, the weak justice delivered under status quo is still infinitely preferable to having the harm denied altogether under Zero-Tolerance.
1.11.6.3.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.4.5.
1.11.6.3.1.6. Con: Many of the examples of high profile domestic/sexual violence cases \(e.g. [Ray Rice](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Ray-Rices-Case-Changed-How-the-NFL-Handles-Domestic-Violence-397515581.html) and [Wayne Carey](http://www.mamamia.com.au/wayne-carey-domestic-violence/)\) involve concrete evidence and/or third party corroboration that make denying the facts impossible.
1.11.6.3.1.6.1. Con: The vast majority of domestic abuse incidents lack evidence such as video footage or public assaults like those referenced above. This begs the question of whether Zero-Tolerance policy would only be effective in dealing with firmly substantiated high-profile cases, leaving the majority of victims with no recompense.
1.11.6.3.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.
1.11.6.3.2. Pro: Zero-Tolerance policies increase the likelihood of violence being covered up.
1.11.6.3.2.1. Con: There already exists the incentive to hide domestic violence to avoid legal or social consequences.
1.11.6.3.2.1.1. Con: The incentive to cover-up the abuse already exists for the abusers, but now that incentive will be extended to their teammates, coaches and managers. Therefore abusers will be less likely to be found out.
1.11.6.3.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.2.
1.11.6.3.2.1.2. Con: The incentive to keep a player from being banned for life is far higher than the incentive to avoid a suspended jail sentence or some hours in community service.
1.11.6.3.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.
1.11.6.3.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.
1.11.6.3.2.4. Pro: When a player's career is at stake, law enforcement officials who are fans of the accused athlete will be less willing to help the victim.
1.11.6.3.2.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.1.1.
1.11.6.3.2.4.2. Con: Law enforcement officials are professionals who can separate their job from their personal lives. It is highly unlikely they would allow their sporting affiliations to interfere with a serious allegation.
1.11.6.3.2.4.2.1. Con: In 2010 when quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was accused of rape, both the police sergeant on scene and the district attorney [sided with the accused](https://perma.cc/T6V7-GVCK) and discouraged the victim from making a report.
1.11.6.3.2.4.2.2. Con: In the rare cases when players' partners have notified law enforcement, police officers did minimal work to help the victim. One NFL player's ex-wife [explains](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/10/17/for-battered-nfl-wives-a-message-from-the-cops-and-the-league-keep-quiet/?utm_term=.820b3f1d1bf9), “When the cops would come, they just said we needed some time apart, and they would talk to \[Wally\] about football...The police tell you, ‘You don’t want this in the news.’”
1.11.6.3.2.4.3. Con: By the same logic, police officers would be more likely to help the victim of a player whose team they barrack against. Thus, even in a world where this occurs, the harms balance out.

1.11.6.3.2.4.5. Con: This phenomenon is more commonly linked to amateur [NCAA players in college towns](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/sites/undefined/undefined/undefined/undefined/undefined/?q=cache:5yVOsaIV9nAJ:www.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fbdavidridpath%2F2016%2F09%2F15%2Fthe-attitude-toward-sexual-and-athlete-violence-in-college-sports-must-change%2F%20&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us#7f8d60aa2834) than to professionals, who often commit their crimes outside of the state or city in which they play.
1.11.6.3.2.4.6. Pro: Sports teams [routinely](https://perma.cc/2HB6-JLKZ) hire off-duty police officers to help with security or work as players' escorts; thus when allegations of domestic violence or sexual assault arise, it's the athlete who tends to be favored by law enforcement.
1.11.6.3.2.4.7. Con: To the extent that police officers are willing to abrogate their responsibilities in order to protect someone who's team they support, the risk of any penalty to that person - for example, jail time - would likely be enough to cause that. As such, this is a status quo problem, and unlikely to be affected by adding additional possible penalties.
1.11.6.3.2.5. Pro: These cover ups often regress social discourse on domestic violence.
1.11.6.3.2.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.2.1.
1.11.6.3.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.
1.11.6.3.3. Pro: Zero-Tolerance policies make victims of domestic violence less willing to come forward.
1.11.6.3.3.1. Con: Victims would be more willing to come forward if they knew they would be taken seriously, which requires a change in culture towards taking domestic violence more seriously.
1.11.6.3.3.1.1. Pro: A Zero-Tolerance policy says to victims that what was done to them is wrong and unforgivable. This assumption of support would make victims more likely to come forward.
1.11.6.3.3.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.6.2.1.5.
1.11.6.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: Jodi Kantor, one of the journalists who broke the story of Weinstein's serial sexual harassment and assault of women, [reports](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/interrogation/2017/10/jodi_kantor_on_how_she_broke_the_harvey_weinstein_story.html) that many of those who spoke to her felt more confident doing so in the wake of recent "successful" stories about sexual assault - that seeing real consequences following other women speaking out had made them feel comfortable doing so as well.
1.11.6.3.3.1.2. Pro: Having a sporting league take the allegation of abuse seriously can embolden the victim to report elsewhere \(e.g. to the police\).
1.11.6.3.3.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.11.6.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.4.
1.11.6.3.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.3.

1.11.6.3.3.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.
1.11.6.3.3.6. Con: Very few victims of domestic or sexual violence come forward unless they want to see their assailant punished.
1.11.6.3.3.6.1. Pro: This is particularly true in reference to sporting leagues. The only recompense they can offer victims is to punish the assailant, so that is the only possible reason for them to come forward.
1.11.6.3.3.6.2. Pro: Insofar as leagues already punish players for domestic or sexual violence \(e.g. through suspensions or hefty fines\), this new version of punishment is unlikely to lead to a decrease in reporting.
1.11.6.3.3.6.2.1. Pro: If players are really so dangerous and volatile, they are likely to react badly to any punishment, not just the loss of their job, such that victims are deterred from reporting.
1.11.6.3.3.6.2.2. Pro: Since domestic abuse incidents among sports leagues are usually highly publicized but poorly handled, wives of players have [stated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/10/17/for-battered-nfl-wives-a-message-from-the-cops-and-the-league-keep-quiet/?utm_term=.820b3f1d1bf9) that “You will hear of a wife murdered before you hear another one come forward.” Implementing a Zero-Tolerance policy is unlikely to change this attitude.
1.11.6.3.3.6.3. Con: Even if this is true, victims should have the right to strike a balance between punishment, rehabilitation, and their own safety.
1.11.6.3.3.6.4. Pro: In 2010, an anonymous college student made a public accusation of sexual assault against [Ben Roethlisberger](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/bmwe8w/ben-roethlisberger-quarterback-twice-accused-of-sexual-assault). She asked the State not to prosecute, suggesting that she only wanted the NFL to take action. Roethlisberger was subsequently suspended for six games.
1.11.6.3.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.3.3.6.2.2.
1.11.6.3.4. Con: A Zero-Tolerance policy gives victims another way by which to get justice, outside of the courts and the absurdly light punishments which leagues give out at the moment.
1.11.6.3.5. Pro: Because they can be implemented unilaterally and without the consent or cooperation of the victim, Zero-Tolerance policies deny victims agency in the justice process.
1.11.6.3.5.1. Con: This assumes that a Zero-Tolerance policy is mutually exclusive with the victim seeking justice in the legal system. They can still do this if they choose to.
1.11.6.3.5.1.1. Con: Victims may not desire any punishment for their assailant, and they are denied that option under a Zero-Tolerance model, which can be implemented without their consent.
1.11.6.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.1.2.
1.11.6.3.5.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.
1.11.6.3.5.1.3. Con: Regardless of whether they seek justice elsewhere or not, a Zero-Tolerance policy necessarily goes over the victim's head in the way it delivers justice.
1.11.6.3.5.2. Con: This can be a good thing. When victims don't have a role in deciding or doling out punishments they are less likely to be targeted by fans and media.
1.11.6.3.5.2.1. Con: This can be harmful to victims who, for whatever reason, decide that they want to recant their allegations.
1.11.6.3.5.2.2. Pro: Under the status quo, victims can easily be persuaded or coerced out of prosecuting their assailant. This may be against their genuine wishes or best interest, as well as the interests of potential future victims.
1.11.6.3.5.3. Pro: According to one study of domestic violence law and policy, mandatory policies are harmful to the victim because they simply replace the power of the abuser with the power of the state [\(Goodmark, p. 54\)](http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?params=/context/law_journal_law_policy/article/1093/&path_info=).
1.11.6.3.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.1.3.2.
1.11.6.3.5.4. Con: Victims do not realistically have much agency in the justice process under the status quo.
1.11.6.3.5.4.1. Pro: Whether the victim wants to prosecute their assailant or not, it is the prosecutor's decision, and not the victim's.
1.11.6.3.5.4.1.1. Con: Prosecutors are the correct actor to decide on this. Generally we do not let the victims decide on the legal proceeding.
1.11.6.3.5.4.2. Pro: Many assailants go unpunished, even where the victim has an obvious desire for punishment.
1.11.6.3.5.4.2.1. Pro: A Zero-Tolerance policy at least acknowledges their victimization in a way that courts of law frequently fail to do.
1.11.6.3.5.4.3. Con: Victims can hire a lawyer, provide evidence, and are listened to as much as the defendant. They are clearly in a position of agency in the judicial process.
1.11.6.3.5.5. Con: It is highly unlikely that anyone would be subject to a Zero-Tolerance policy without the victim's cooperation.
1.11.6.3.5.5.1. Pro: Domestic and sexual violence are frequently referred to as '[he said/she said](http://beforeitsnews.com/crime-all-stars/2015/05/he-said-she-said-the-difficulty-of-evidence-in-domestic-violence-cases-2-2453362.html)' cases. This makes clear the significance of victim testimony to determining the assailant's guilt.
1.11.6.3.5.5.2. Con: Often these incidents leave physical evidence which does not need corroboration from the victim \(e.g. [surveillance tapes of Ray Rice knocking fiancee Janay out cold in an elevato](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Ray-Rices-Case-Changed-How-the-NFL-Handles-Domestic-Violence-397515581.html)r\).
1.11.6.3.5.5.3. Con: Often times, victims of domestic abuse decide to [recant](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-domestic-violence-study-idUSTRE77I6FE20110819) after levying an accusation against their abuser. Zero-Tolerance policy might make it more difficult for victims to change their mind once the wheels of accusation are in motion.
1.11.6.3.5.6. Pro: For women who have been victimised to such a great degree, having some kind of agency in the way justice is meted out can be empowering.
1.11.6.3.5.7. Pro: -> See 1.3.6.2.1.
1.11.6.4. Pro: Zero-Tolerance policies are socially devastating for victims.
1.11.6.4.1. Pro: Escaping an abusive situation often requires a degree of anonymity, both to avoid retribution from a violent and controlling partner and to be able to get a 'fresh start'. The media coverage which accompanies a Zero-Tolerance policy will make this virtually impossible.
1.11.6.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.3.
1.11.6.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.1.
1.11.6.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.
1.11.6.4.5. Pro: The media attention that  Zero-Tolerance policy garners is harmful to victims, since prolonged media exposure and public discussion of the abuse make [re-traumatization](https://crcvc.ca/publications/media-guide/victims-and-media/) a concern as victims are frequently exposed to traumatic stresses.
1.11.6.4.5.1. Con: That is not the policy's fault but the media, and how they choose to portray domestic abuse taking victims’ into consideration and avoiding re-victimisation or not.
1.11.6.4.6. Con: Any appropriately severe punishment that the player receives is going to bring the same level of social harms to the victim. The appropriate counterfactual is therefore the victim staying with the abusive partner which is worse.
1.11.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.3.5.
1.11.6.6. Con: -> See 1.11.6.3.3.1.2.
1.11.6.7. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.
1.11.6.8. Con: -> See 1.1.7.
1.11.6.9. Pro: Loss of income incurred by an athlete's ban would impact their ability to pay legal recompense to their victims or otherwise provide monetary support. Not all athletes are multi-millionaires who could absorb such a loss of income.
1.11.7. Pro: Without Zero-Tolerance policies, teams only care about how good a player is. If a single act could get a player banned for life, teams would be more judicious about giving valuable roster spots to a player who is a noticeable risk of getting banned.
1.11.7.1. Con: -> See 1.11.6.3.2.
1.11.7.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.2.
1.11.7.3. Con: Institutional efforts to identify abusers are at best problematic and at worst doomed to failure.
1.11.7.3.1. Pro: It is incredibly difficult to identify someone likely to commit abuse before the fact.
1.11.7.3.1.1. Pro: It is also incredibly unfair to preclude a person from involvement in something based solely on the prediction of a crime that they have not yet committed.
1.11.7.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.11.7.3.2. Pro: Abusers are often incredibly good at hiding their actions. Indeed, most organisations suggest that [abuse is best recognised via the victim](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/abuse/domestic-violence-and-abuse.htm) rather than the perpetrator.
1.11.7.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.11.7.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.
1.11.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.7.
1.11.9. Pro: Instituting an industry-wide Zero-Tolerance standard would prevent many reported incidents from being swept under the rug.
1.11.9.1. Pro: A [study](http://harvardjsel.com/2015/07/bethany-withers-without-consequence/) of domestic abuse incidents perpetrated by athletes between 2010-2014 showed that of 64 reported incidents, only 7 players were punished by their league and only 2 were punished by their team.
1.11.9.1.1. Con: The 64 instances the source refers to were all only 'alleged', not proven. Under a Zero-Tolerance policy, the league would have to make an adjudication on the facts, and presumably return numerous 'not guilty' verdicts.
1.11.9.1.1.1. Con: Inaction is significantly more harmful under a Zero-Tolerance policy, because it suggests no abuse occurred, as opposed to a subjective decision not to act.
1.11.9.1.1.2. Pro: This is particularly true given that the league will have a strong incentive to return 'not guilty' verdicts in order to prevent their best players from being banned, and presumably will have a lower standard of proof than courts.
1.11.9.2. Con: This is not meaningful if rates of reporting decrease, as players don't want to get their peers banned under the policy.
1.11.9.2.1. Pro: At least when the incident is reported, even if no formal action is taken, club officials are aware of the situation and can monitor it for signs of it worsening.
1.11.9.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.2.1.1.2.
1.12. Con: -> See 1.11.6.
