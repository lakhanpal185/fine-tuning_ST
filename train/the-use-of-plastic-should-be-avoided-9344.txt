1.2. Pro: The less plastic we use, the less plastic pollution there will be.
1.2.1. Pro: Less reliance on plastics would go a great distance to ensuring that no more plastic ends up in the oceans. Plastic is the worlds oceans has now reached an epidemic concentration. Reduction of plastic use and subsequent disposal would ensure healthy oceans and continued biodiversity.
1.2.2. Pro: Avoiding plastic reduces our reliance of landfills.
1.3. Pro: The less plastic we use, the less plastic we need to produce.

1.5. Con: One person cannot make a difference.
1.5.1. Con: Yet one person can set an example and inspire others.
1.6. Pro: Plastics are exported and, therefore, less plastic reduces emissions that result from transportation.
1.6.1. Pro: Global plastic production is fairly focused on Asia with about 50% being produced there \([p.17](https://www.plasticseurope.org/application/files/5715/1717/4180/Plastics_the_facts_2017_FINAL_for_website_one_page.pdf)\)
1.6.2. Pro: China exported [$17.9 billion](http://www.worldstopexports.com/plastic-item-exports-country/) worth of plastic items in 2017.
