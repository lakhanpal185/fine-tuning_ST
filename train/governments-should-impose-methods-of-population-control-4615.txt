Discussion Title: Governments should impose methods of population control.

1. Governments should impose coercive methods of population control.
1.1. Con: People should be free to have as many children as they want.
1.1.1. Pro: The [Proclamation of Tehran](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/SRHRL/PDF/IHRDArticle15/Proclamation_of_Teheran_Eng.pdf), established during United Nation's 1968 International Conference on Human Rights states that: "Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children."
1.1.1.1. Pro: [Reproductive rights](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights) include abortion, contraception, freedom from forced sterilization, reproductive healthcare and education and information.
1.1.1.2. Con: This is outdated and needs to be reformulated to account for the carrying capacity of the planet.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Earth's carrying capacity hasn't changed since 1968 - only our ability to manage resources and growth. Rather than reformulating basic human rights every 40 years, we should focus on finding more sustainable ways for people to live, while still maintaining their freedom to procreate.
1.1.1.3. Con: The word ‘responsibly’ is a subjective caveat that allows state intervention on the ‘freely’ part.  The convention is essentially meaningless.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: The world population has doubled since 1968.  If "responsibly" is to mean anything at all, it must take into account the unsustainability of unlimited growth.
1.1.2. Con: A few members of society having an unusually large number of children can have a disproportionate level of influence on society relative to those with fewer children.
1.1.3. Con: Freedom to procreate also entails a responsibility for those children; i.e., people have a moral obligation not to have more children than they can reasonably provide for. That principle applies on an individual and family basis, but also on a global basis.
1.1.3.1. Con: That may be considered a moral principle, yet from a legal point of view, democracies give their citizens the right to have the number of children they choose, regardless.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Governments only intervene when children are neglected or at risk, but they do not confer themselves the power to decide on people's families prior birth. If on an individual basis, governments do not exert such powers, it seems unlikely they would or could do so on a global basis.
1.1.3.1.2. Con: In democracies, legal points of view should and will always be subject to revision provided we want and vote in the direction of change. A democracy could, in theory, not provide said right.
1.1.3.2. Con: If individuals and families have a moral and legal obligation to provide for their own children, then they will have a sustainable amount of children and there is no need for a government to intervene.
1.1.3.2.1. Con: Many people do not abide by this moral obligation. This leads to increased poverty and overpopulation.
1.2. Pro: Overpopulation drains the resources of the planet and is unsustainable.
1.2.1. Pro: Unless actions are taken to slow population growth, humans will continue to expand until we can no longer support ourselves and eventually there will be a mass die-off. Either we can choose to make our existence a sustainable one that can continue into the future, or we can suffer the consequences of a catastrophic die-off leading to the end of our species.
1.2.1.1. Pro: We don't have enough food to sustain higher populations, and will run out if governments don't impose restrictions on their citizens.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: An [Oxfam report](http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/803791/World-will-run-out-of-food-by-2050-population-boom) suggests that although the population is rapidly increasing, agricultural yields have almost halved since 1990.
1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: The study only included traditional farming techniques.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Food technology will generate a vast over supply.  New technology, such as optimum light yield lamps, automated greenhouses, vertical growth, as well as complex permacultures provide very high yields of vegetation food.  Insects provide very high yields of fat free, high protein food.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In a [2015 NIH study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4483736/), hydroponics offered 11 ± 1.7 times higher yields compared to conventionally produced lettuce.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The same article states that said lettuce required 82 ± 11 times more energy compared to its conventionally produced version. This is an unsustainable amount of energy.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Hydroponically-grown agriculture requires substantially less water and land use than conventional agriculture.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: There are proposals to 'green' deserts, which would give huge amount of new and productive land.
1.2.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Ultimately, there is a daily calorie limit defined by solar energy input. The sun inputs a finite amount of energy every day, and even on 100% uptake into the food chain, that is ultimately finite.
1.2.1.1.2. Con: If humans [slowed or halted their consumption of meat](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/five-things-would-happen-if-everyone-stopped-eating-meat-a6844811.html), there would be enough food for everyone to eat.
1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: [97% of the world's soy crop is fed to livestock.](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gkz-CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=97%25+world%27s+soymeal+animals&source=bl&ots=XAaEZH1gm3&sig=bnPO3NMvNCTznCCfPURWcuQfaus&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj1_uLA-9HKAhWIzRQKHRDND8UQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q=97%25%20world's%20soymeal%2)
1.2.1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.1.1.1.
1.2.1.2. Pro: As population continues to increase, it will become increasingly more difficult to stop further population growth, or achieve a return to sustainable levels.
1.2.1.3. Con: The number of humans does not matter much but the patterns of consumption.
1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The US, for example, has a significantly higher [ecological footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_ecological_footprint) than Hungary.
1.2.1.4. Con: A large number of humans is self-limiting. Scarce resources, new diseases, war and displacement will cut large numbers without government intervention.
1.2.1.4.1. Con: The situations referenced are speculative, and may not occur at all or before the population becomes unsustainable.
1.2.1.4.2. Con: The problems that are associated with scarce resources are exactly the problems one is trying to avoid my managing population growth.
1.2.1.5. Con: This only applies to high consumer societies. Over half the Worlds population live on $1 a day or less their impact is minimal
1.2.1.6. Con: Controls on population, even if necessary, do not have to be  invasive and authoritarian.
1.2.1.6.1. Pro: Education and contraception slow population growth.  These measures are sufficient in many cases.
1.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: Education and income for women [are inversely related](https://wol.iza.org/uploads/articles/228/pdfs/female-education-and-its-impact-on-fertility.pdf) to how many children they have.
1.2.1.6.1.1.1. Con: [According to VOX](http://voxeu.org/article/highly-educated-women-no-longer-have-fewer-kids), this was a function of the 1990s but no longer holds true. In 2015, highly-educated women did not have fewer children than women with a lower education.
1.2.1.6.2. Pro: Equality and economic prosperity control birth rates.
1.2.1.6.2.1. Pro: Most economies develop in par with population [growth](http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Brief7-the-relationships-between-economic-growth-and-population-growth.pdf). However, when an economy is established, fertility rates tend to drop \(more time is dedicated to education, technical aspects improve productivity, etc.\). At that time, a decline in population growth is an opportunity for the [GDP per capita](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e566/aad3d90979a2f0349ccb308ac433fa106e27.pdf) to increase.
1.2.1.6.2.1.1. Pro: For example, empirical studies present a model in which for some countries, a 1% point decline in population growth equals or can lead to a [6.81% increase](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e566/aad3d90979a2f0349ccb308ac433fa106e27.pdf) in GDP per capita growth.
1.2.1.6.2.1.2. Con: Economies that have undergone that transition \(from expanding populations to dropping fertility rates\) for a long time, may risk a lack of economic growth when their fertility rates drop and old and dependent population is too high compared to young and productive individuals.
1.2.1.7. Pro: As populations rise, the government is forced to provide fewer funds to each person. Therefore, if sizes are limited, there will be more financial support for each person, thus giving a country with higher intellectual levels.[debate.org](http://www.debate.org/debates/Population-Control/2/)
1.2.1.7.1. Con: Since it takes people to produce the wealth that governments take their taxes from, increasing numbers are not a problem for any government budget - only an increase in the proportion of net takers is.
1.2.1.7.2. Con: Governments are not supposed to provide financial support anyways, but only to provide services such as national defense, a legal system and law enforcement. These services can be provided for any number of people, even with minimal taxation.
1.2.1.7.2.1. Con: Regardless of what you see as the aims of government, there will still be less money to spend on "support for each person" \(through e.g. law enforcement\) if it is true that more people have to be supported on similar tax receipts.
1.2.1.8. Pro: World population is already unsustainably high, and [key natural resources](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/oct/31/six-natural-resources-population) \(fresh water, oil and gas, phosphorus, various other minerals\) are expected to run out in a few decades.
1.2.1.8.1. Pro: Freshwater makes up only 3% of the water on Earth's surface. An unsettling number of large rivers—including the Colorado, Rio Grande, Yellow, Indus, Ganges, Amu Darya, Murray, and Nile—are now so overtapped that they discharge little or no water to the sea for months at a time. [\(National Geographic\)](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/freshwater/rivers/)
1.2.1.8.2. Pro: [According to Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/phosphorus-a-looming-crisis/), the worldwide phosphorus shortage poses an immediate threat to our food supply. Phosphorus is one of the most important elements in soil, and without a sufficient supply, crops are unable to grow.
1.2.1.9. Con: In the past technological changes have allowed us to do more with less. Perhaps future advances in technology will solve many of the problems we experience today. For example more efficient renewable energy could limit man-made climate change.
1.2.2. Con: What drains resources is not overpopulation but massive consumerism.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Even if the population were to remain constant, resource demand will increase factorally if currently-undeveloped countries increase their resource consumption per capita to developed-country levels. It is not population, but massive consumerism that poses the risk.
1.2.2.1.1. Con: This is a false dichotomy. There can be multiple compounding risks. The existence of one does not negate the existence of the other.
1.2.2.1.2. Con: This appears to assume that there would be no benefit to both population control and reduced consumerism. While that reducing consumerism is good is true, it does not directly argue against a system to at least slow population growth.
1.2.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.3.
1.2.2.3. Pro: Over population would not be a problem if governments would stop enabling/promoting non-sustainable corporatized consumption of resources.
1.2.2.4. Con: A larger population demands more consumption. While there are demonstrable ways to reduce the population there is no known viable way to reduce people's desire and demand for useful products. Therefore, reducing the population is far easier than reducing consumerism.
1.2.2.5. Con: It should be easier and more pleasant to be asked, encouraged or incentivized to make fewer consumers and polluters than to be forced to consume fewer goods.
1.2.2.6. Pro: Single-child high-income families can consume way more than families with more children on lower incomes.
1.2.3. Con: World [crude birth rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate)  have decreased in the last decades and are predicted to keep decreasing in the near future.
1.2.3.1. Pro: Population growth [peaked in the 1960's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth#/media/File:World_population_growth_rate_1950%E2%80%932050.svg), and has fallen substantially since then. The world birthrate has fallen from [5.0 in the late 60's](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN/?end=2015&start=1960), to hovering just under 2.5 currently. The population that needs controlled, is the small group of elite at the top that continue to rape our planet in the name of profits. Growth is falling, yet emissions and pollution are rising at alarming rates. Focus on "Greed Control".
1.2.3.2. Pro: [Birthrates](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html) are falling all across the globe: in the 1970s women had around 6 children and today they have just 2.7  on average, and in some places only 1.
1.2.3.3. Con: The rate of growth reached a maximum in 1968, but the world population has not peaked and continues to [grow unsustainably](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).
1.2.3.4. Pro: The UN recently revised its [population growth](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/population-paradox-europes-time-bomb-888030.html) predictions: from expecting 11.5 billion by 2050, experts now claim that the peak will be at 9.5 billion people around 2070, and then it will begin to decline.
1.2.3.4.1. Con: If all humans stopped eating meat, a highly unlikely occurrence in any scenario, scientists predict that Earth could have a maximum human carrying capacity of 10 billion. A global population of 9.5 billion would be catastrophic to human life. We would most likely run out of food and freshwater long before the proposed population decline around 2070. [livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/16493-people-planet-earth-support.html)
1.2.3.4.1.1. Pro: According to [Harvard Scientist Edward O. Wilson](https://www.livescience.com/16493-people-planet-earth-support.html): "If everyone on the planet agreed to become vegetarian, leaving little or nothing for livestock, the present 1.4 billion hectares of arable land \(3.5 billion acres\) would support about 10 billion people." Since it is virtually impossible to keep every human on Earth from eating meat or raising livestock, we will be unable to support the food supply for 10 billion humans in 2050.
1.2.3.5. Pro: Growth [rates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/baby-crisis-europe-brink-depopulation-disaster) are already below-replacement rate in most of the developed world, and have progressed to negative in places like [Japan](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/02/japans-population-is-shrinking-what-does-it-mean-for-the-economy/).
1.2.3.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.4.1.1.
1.2.4. Pro: Economic forces naturally tend to drive up the population, on the other hand natural resources are limited in nature. To guarantee long term societal viability is a goverment duty.
1.2.5. Con: [Overpopulation is a myth](https://www.kialo.com/overpopulation-is-a-myth-9226)
1.2.6. Pro: A smaller population is beneficial in almost every conceivable way. For example, fewer people means more resources per person, closer communities, reduced pollution, preservation of rural land, less waste produced. Smaller is easier to manage, generally speaking.
1.2.6.1. Con: Australia is dealing with an issue of underpopulation: their population size cannot exploit the natural resources at an economically prosperous rate.
1.2.6.2. Pro: Spreading out the same funds and technology over a smaller population can allow for well planned and designed slow growth that can afford to take the time and resources for long term solutions that last and improve quality of life.
1.2.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.6.2.1.
1.2.6.3. Pro: Countries with small populations may offer job opportunities for all of their citizens.
1.2.6.3.1. Con: The list of  countries which are closer to [full employment](http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2012/04/25/nine-countries-where-everyone-has-job.html) include highly populated nations like China or Japan.
1.2.6.3.2. Con: Under populated countries can also face trouble such as not having enough manpower to exploit their resources or not enough potential workers in key positions.
1.2.6.4. Con: Smaller population means fewer people in the workforce. With less workers, economic growth is slowed.
1.2.6.5. Pro: A sustaining stable population in balance with what the environment they're in can provide respects the next generation's ability to have access to virtually the same resources their parents did, as opposed to less.
1.2.6.6. Pro: We do have limits \(personal, logistical, monetary, etc...\) on how big a party we throw at our house, how many guests that wedding should have, and how many kids that 2 bedroom apartment can sustain, and we don't leave that to chance. The country or the planet is the same problem at a much bigger scale.
1.2.7. Pro: Infinite growth with finite resources is impossible. Permitting the freedom of any number of children in any circumstance invites the consequences of such impossibility \(wars, famine, pollution, nuclear war, extinction, etc\) even if we're not at the breaking point yet.
1.2.8. Pro: Taking care of fewer children requires fewer resources, and therefore strains local and global resources less.
1.2.8.1. Pro: Population control would help combat [climate change](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/best-way-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-one-government-isn-t-telling-you-about).
1.2.8.1.1. Con: Combating climate change will require the deliberate and collaborative work of millions of people. A smaller population would mean less brains to dream up solutions to climate change, and less muscle power to implement those solutions.
1.2.8.1.1.1. Con: At the current population level, international collaboration is not feasible. Although we may possess environmentally-friendly alternatives, putting them into practice has proven unsustainable.
1.2.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: The United States, second largest carbon polluter in the world, will not sign the Paris Climate Agreement. [nytimes.com](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/climate/syria-joins-paris-agreement.html)
1.2.8.1.1.2. Con: Smaller population also decreases the consumption fueling climate change.
1.2.9. Con: The elite’s control of the majority of resources is the cause of artificial poverty. It is the elite’s hoarding of resources which is unsustainable.
1.3. Con: Nature offers better forms of population control than those implemented by governments.
1.3.1. Pro: Governments are not able to control population growth anyway. Nature instead will take care of it automatically once the carrying capacity of Earth is reached.
1.3.1.1. Pro: It is unrealistic for the government to be expected to consistently provide social goods of high quality in an equitable manner if the population is growing too quickly or shrinking too quickly.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: Most governments may not have "providing social goods of high quality in an equitable manner" as their goals. Therefore, their failure to do so is not an incentive to apply methods of population control.
1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Democratic nations have an obligation to keep things peaceful, healthy, safe and ethical at home. According to the Preamble of the U.S. Constitution, the purpose of government is to "establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity." Soft controls are essential to attaining these goals.
1.3.1.2. Con: But at what cost? As we approach the "natural carrying capacity" of our planet, we threaten the existence of many animal species.
1.3.1.3. Pro: Governments and supranational institutions are unable to distribute birth control tools to [222 million women](http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/09/26/why-222-million-women-cant-get-the-birth-control-they-need/) worldwide.
1.3.2. Con: If this were the case, the Earth's population wouldn't be ballooning at the rate at which it continues to do so. There is only a finite amount of space and resources on this planet; we either need to respect the limitations of our environment, or find another environment to inhabit \(and a method for reaching it, obviously.\)
1.3.3. Con: The amount of suffering caused by natural disasters outweighs the benefit of a marginally decreased population. It should be a goal to minimize deaths and suffering from natural disasters. We as people should find more humane methods of population control.
1.3.3.1. Pro: Over 5000 people died in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The amount of human suffering and damage endured were catastrophic. Can we not find more humane ways to limit the population than to allow disasters to do so?
1.3.3.1.1. Con: Hard controls like forced sterilisation or forced abortions are not humane either.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Pro: The difference between natural disasters and hard controls imposed by governments is that the former are not preventable or stoppable, yet the latter are.
1.3.4. Con: Methods of population control through nature no longer have a significant effect on population numbers.
1.3.4.1. Con: Low IQ is still significantly positively correlated with ill health and [early mortality](http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b5282), suggesting nature still does reduce the undesirable part of the population.
1.3.4.1.1. Pro: [A study](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/low-i-q-predicts-heart-disease/) published by The European Journal of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation found that people with lower IQ scores had four times higher risk of heart disease.
1.3.4.1.2. Con: However, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25928436) show that when educational attainment is held constant, people with low IQ scores do not have higher mortality by age 70 than people with higher IQ test scores.
1.3.4.2. Pro: Even America has now implemented universal healthcare subsidised by the wealthy. This will act as a significant check on the effect nature has on the American population.
1.3.4.3. Pro: Progress has made humans able to prevent most forms of natural population control like famine, droughts, disease, predators, etc.
1.3.4.3.1. Pro: With the advances in medical and engineering technology, and informed policy, most "natural" forms of population control have been mitigated. We live longer and are healthier and are much safer than we ever have been. Any natural occurrences do not put any significant dent in the population.
1.3.4.3.2. Pro: [Vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm) have prevented tens of thousands of deaths each year since their creation.
1.3.4.3.3. Pro: The human species has basically never had problems with predators.
1.3.5. Pro: A modern version of the Spanish flu, resulting from intensive pork and poultry farming \(often in close proximity\), spread by air travel, is quite probable in the near to mid-range future. There would be a significant reduction in this case.
1.3.6. Pro: Without food imports, areas with excess population will see famines from local resource exhaustion. Countries like Pakistan and Somalia are vastly overpopulated compared to local food production… With the advance of Global Warming, large scale famines will become more frequent.
1.3.7. Con: It is human nature to go against Nature. Humanity works against all kinds of population control that nature throws at us, whether it be sickness and epidemics, natural catastrophes, or even our own biology by trying to delay ageing and dying.
1.4. Con: Some forms of population controls enacted by governments have disastrous economic and social effects.
1.4.1. Pro: Historically, population planning methods have been gender and minority-targeted, and only serve to exploit the agendas of the wealthy and powerful.
1.4.1.1. Pro: In the last decades, there are many documented instances of forced sterilisation to [Native American](https://daily.jstor.org/the-little-known-history-of-the-forced-sterilization-of-native-american-women/) women without their knowledge in the US.
1.4.1.2. Pro: There are accounts of [African American](http://www.msnbc.com/all/eugenic-sterilization-victims-belated-justice) women sterilized against their knowledge or consent in some states of the US, as well as doctors knowingly [not treating](https://daily.jstor.org/the-lasting-fallout-of-the-tuskegee-syphilis-study/) African American men for sexually transmitted diseases.
1.4.1.3. Pro: The United Nations has criticised Australia for allowing the forced sterilisation of women with [disabilities](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/10/un-examines-australias-forced-sterilisation-of-women-with-disabilities).
1.4.1.4. Pro: In [Peru](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-34855804), 60,874 women were pressured or forced to be sterilised between 1996 and 2000, most of them were poor and indigenous.
1.4.1.5. Pro: In China, one-child and two-child policies have led to [violence](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151030-china-one-child-policy-mei-fong/) and oppression.
1.4.1.5.1. Pro: Since women typically marry out, Chinese parents prefer to have boys as they believe they will provide a future of income and stability for the family. This has led to abandonment and mistreatment and neglect of [female babies](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34666440).
1.4.1.5.2. Pro: [China](https://fee.org/articles/chinas-one-child-disaster/)'s 'One Child Policy' led to a below-[replacement](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2017/02/below-replacement-birth-rates-in-china-and-japan-colour-their-future-population-grey-1021668w) birth rate, causing an inversion in the population pyramid and economic issues.
1.4.1.5.2.1. Con: Below-replacement birth rate means that there is greater wealth \(i.e. property\) available for the younger, smaller population. For instance, after the black death in Europe the following generations were much wealthier.
1.4.1.5.2.1.1. Con: China's 'One Child Policy' reduced the number of children per family, resulting in excessive attention and spending power dedicated to the children, resulting in a problem called 'the Little Emperor effect'. [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Emperor_Syndrome)
1.4.1.5.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.6.2.1.2.
1.4.1.5.2.2. Pro: [Japan](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/02/japans-population-is-shrinking-what-does-it-mean-for-the-economy/) also has an inverted population pyramid and a resulting ageing population. This is causing severe economic problems, which Japan is facing by implementing policies to increase birth rates.
1.4.1.5.2.3. Con: In the long term the population pyramid will re-balance itself. The short-term pain of moving to a more sustainable population will outweigh the long-term pain of over population.
1.4.1.5.2.4. Con: Population control does not only imply discouraging births. It may also mean encouraging births to correct an overly elderly population.
1.4.1.5.2.4.1. Con: Measures to [encourage](https://www.mercatornet.com/demography/view/what-can-governments-do-to-increase-birthrates/16578) or decrease births are only [indirect](http://mentalfloss.com/article/33485/6-creative-ways-countries-have-tried-their-birth-rates), with methods such as public campaigns, paid childcare, subsidies or tax breaks, therefore they cannot completely ensure results. However, direct measures of population control to reduce births, such as forced sterilisation or one-chil-only policies, can be enforced to have tangible results.
1.4.1.6. Con: If the controls target females \(the natural bottleneck on population growth\) then population management/limitation is doable.
1.4.1.7. Pro: In the past, forced sterilisation of [Aboriginal](http://english.khamenei.ir/news/3638/Australia-s-sanitized-genocide-against-Aborigines-in-the-21st#_ednref14) women and children was widespread in Australia.
1.4.2. Pro: Hard restrictions or punishment for having many children can cause parents to abandon their kids once they are born.
1.4.2.1. Con: If this results in the death of evolutionarily unfit children, then it may be good for society if they are abandoned.
1.4.2.1.1. Con: There is no way to know whether the children are fit or not from an evolutionary point of view when they are abandoned. The very opposite, abandoning highly fit children is as much likely.
1.4.2.2. Pro: Children raised in orphanages generally have [lower IQ](https://goo.gl/D18XQ5)
1.4.2.2.1. Con: No study as yet has shown this while controlling for genetic confounding
1.4.3. Pro: [Problems](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/chinas-onechild-policy-a-demographic-disaster/news-story/5a71127133138acec2644df76f01d9b0) from [China](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2015-11-05/true-history-china-s-disastrous-one-child-policy), as a case study.
1.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.2.
1.4.3.2. Pro: China's 'One Child Policy', coupled with cultural and social norms, resulted in a [gender imbalance](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/chinas-onechild-policy-a-demographic-disaster/news-story/5a71127133138acec2644df76f01d9b0) in China, as male offspring was preferred.
1.4.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.
1.4.3.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.2.1.1.
1.4.4. Con: Few events are objectively "disastrous". Even the black death is considered by many historians to have been beneficial.
1.4.4.1. Con: Being sterilized or not treated for an STD is disastrous at a personal level.
1.4.4.2. Con: There are plenty of examples in which these policies led to gender imbalances and more men than women, resulting in aging and unsustainable populations.
1.4.4.2.1. Con: This is due to the population's culture of favouring sons, more than to the policy itself. In a culture where both sons and daughters are valued equally, one can expect a normal gender distribution.
1.4.4.2.1.1. Con: Considering sexism and the favoring of sons is something quite extended globally, even more so in under-developed countries, gender imbalance, at present, is the most likely outcome.
1.4.4.2.1.2. Con: When implementing policies, adverse results due to specific cultural values must be taken into account. If not, as observed per the Chinese example, the results do not fulfill goals or create new problems.
1.4.5. Con: Severe forms of overpopulation have even higher negative effects \(over fishing species to extinction, climate change, over hunting, deforestation affecting even more species, wars for resources, possibility of nuclear or biological war, nuclear winters, etc...\).
1.4.5.1. Pro: Most of our problems comes from lack of resources. When there can be more than enough resources, yet for less people.
1.4.6. Con: We must learn from those failures and do it better.
1.4.7. Con: The real economic and ecologic disaster is the 8 billion of people.
1.4.7.1. Pro: The agriculture has significant impact on ecology.
1.4.7.2. Pro: The more people requires the more energy and resources.
1.4.8. Con: Said forms of population control that were attempted and failed may either be improved upon or simply discarded. The fact that some methods failed does not mean that there aren't successful methods available.
1.4.9. Pro: It is nearly impossible for governments to try directly controlling fertility without getting into the highly unethical businesses of eugenics, ethnic preference, flat-out bribery and elitist corruption. Then there would be the task of "correcting" for failed fertility controls.
1.5. Con: Governments do not have the right to impose direct or hard controls on its population's birth rate.
1.5.1. Pro: Population control methods are authoritarian in nature and contrary to the concept of individual liberty.
1.5.1.1. Con: Aren't all laws authoritarian in nature? We sacrifice our right\(s\) for the greater good.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: No, laws protecting an individual’s rights from an aggressor aren’t authoritarian. Laws that tell people how to live by presuming to know the “greater good” often are.
1.5.1.2. Con: If 'individual liberty' results in mass extinction of other species, then it's a bad moral principle.
1.5.1.3. Pro: Compulsory sterilization, regardless of intent, is a direct violation of women's right to health.
1.5.2. Pro: The only legitimate form of population control are immigration restrictions. Governments are obligated to secure the territory against invasion and control the inflow of people. However, they have no mandate to interfere with the reproductive choices of their citizens.
1.5.2.1. Con: Immigration control does not effect global population issues.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Immigration control can greatly affect worldwide economic development. According to a [major report](http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-monitoring-report) released by the World Bank in 2016, the "current pattern of mass migration can reshape economic development for decades and, while posing challenges, offers a path to ending extreme poverty and shared prosperity."
1.5.2.2. Con: Governments have other mandates, such as reducing the incidence of starvation and homelessness among their population, for which reproductive interference is a valid, if not ideal, approach.
1.5.2.3. Con: The reproductive choices of individual citizens may directly affect the well-being of current and future generations of citizens. The government should interfere to prevent the exercise of individual choices that are harmful to others.
1.5.2.3.1. Con: Reproductive choices of citizens do not directly impact others. At most they indirectly impact others.
1.5.3. Pro: Any government intervention on your life is unethical, against property rights. Utility is irrelevant
1.5.4. Con: The discussion is about whether they should have the right, not whether they do. We elect governing bodies \(in democratic nations\) to make policy based on the needs of the nation and as it's being come to realize, the entire planet. A lot of global concerns are being realized, most of which would resolve with a decline in global population.
1.5.5. Con: Governments do have a lot of rights to control population e.g. by allowing/disallowing birth-control and abortions, providing social security and education. All these things are under the control of the government.
1.5.6. Con: Governments could have any right to impose anything provided the population votes in that direction, or allows oppressive leadership to take a hold of power \(see [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) for context\).
1.5.7. Con: Governments have the authority to end life, ergo they have the authority to prevent life.
1.5.7.1. Con: Governments have the legitimate monopoly of violence. And thus, for it to be legitimate, governments are only allowed to end life to protect others \(or, in countries with death penalty, as a punishment for a crime\). Preventing a life from existing does not fulfill does requirements and also impacts the rights of the prospective parents.
1.6. Con: Softer, indirect and non-coercive policies have more social and political benefits.
1.6.1. Pro: There are reliably effective ways to lower birth rates that are soft-controls, not hard controls that infringe on freedoms. What's more, countries with very high birth rates have a longer way to go in progressing in areas such as: education \(not just sexual education and family planning education, but education on all academic fronts, economic progress and the
empowerment of women \(often tied to economic progress\).
1.6.1.1. Pro: These soft measures often have to be controlled as well. For instance, education of girls and women may require government imposition rather than developing organically.
1.6.2. Pro: It is not unreasonable for a government to incentivize families for having more or less children as deemed ideal by population projection and societal need. Such a measure would not threaten a persons rights, as there is no risk of negative consequences for refusing the incentive. It would however increase the number of families procreating at sustainable rates.
1.6.3. Pro: Softer polices will likely have more social acceptance.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Politicians may not be willing to implement hard controls that undermine human rights out of fear of being voted out of office. Therefore, softer controls are easier to carry out.
1.6.3.2. Pro: Coercive methods are a very extreme step that may give rise to major backlash/revolt, perhaps even civil unrest and anarchy.
1.6.4. Pro: Improving female education is [strongly correlated](http://blogs.worldbank.org/health/female-education-and-childbearing-closer-look-data) with \(and causes\) reductions in fertility rates. Policies in that direction would help.
1.6.5. Con: -> See 1.4.1.5.2.4.1.
1.6.6. Pro: Non coercive methods are more ethical and more effective. For example, [RISUG](https://newatlas.com/risug-male-contraception/18824/) \(reversible vasectomy\) and IUDs could be made very inexpensive, allowing adults to affordably and temporarily opt-out of parenthood. This could reduce the population to manageable levels on its own.
1.6.7. Con: The sooner population control measures are implemented, the lighter and less intrusive they can be. The more drastic the overpopulation problem is, the more drastic the necessary solutions will become.
1.7. Pro: Families are better when they are smaller.
1.7.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.8.
1.7.2. Pro: Having fewer children allows parents to invest in the education and future of their children.
1.7.2.1. Pro: Limited education budgets are distributed among fewer children.
1.7.2.2. Pro: In developing nations, parents often have more children to compensate for the higher rate of infant mortality.
1.7.2.3. Con: Having a good education doesn't necessarily correlate with having a happy life. This has been demonstrated with this long term, extensive [study](https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PLjKbuqA_Sz_AbegtIgZqJyaVZtxK_3rAz&v=8KkKuTCFvzI) of Harvard students and poor children without high education, which have been followed through their lives until their oldest days. It has been showed that good social and familial relationships was the most relevant factor of having a long and happy life.
1.7.2.3.1. Con: Having a good education may not be that important in terms of happiness \(compared to social and familial relationships\) but it is indeed an important factor in [employability](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2012/09/17/education-is-the-key-to-better-jobs/).
1.7.2.3.1.1. Con: Having a satisfactory \(happy\) life should be the main goal of everyone. Looking for employment at any cost is irrelevant if it doesn't help you to reach that goal.
1.7.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Good social and familial relationships \(and happiness\) are not mutually exclusive with having a small family which, in turn, is a more likely setting to achieve good education.
1.7.2.3.2. Con: -> See 1.7.2.3.1.1.1.
1.7.3. Pro: Having fewer children enhances gender equality in developing countries.
1.7.3.1. Pro: Smaller family sizes allows women to participate in the workforce and increase household income.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: A fair divison of childcare and household tasks may help women participate in the workforce better than smaller families.
1.7.3.2. Con: None of the 10 nations rated lowest for perceived gender equality have remarkably high fertility rates. In fact, most fall far below the global average. [usnews.com](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/slideshows/the-10-worst-countries-for-gender-equality-ranked-by-perception)
1.7.4. Con: Growing up without siblings can have negative social consequences on both youth and adult life. [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3237053/)
1.7.4.1. Pro: Growing up without siblings affects the frequency of engaging in certain social events as a child - including time spent with friends.
1.7.4.2. Pro: Adult only-children have significantly [less frequent interaction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3237053/) with relatives as adults.
1.7.4.3. Con: Only-children are exposed to more adult conversation and may receive more parental attention.
1.7.4.4. Pro: Having more than one sibling increases the chances that you will have a friendly relationship with at least one of them. Having a sibling with whom you can share your thoughts is important for your personal development.
1.7.5. Con: Families in poor countries and rural areas in the First World often rely on their [offspring](http://nfwm.org/education-center/farm-worker-issues/children-in-the-fields/) to perform agricultural tasks. Small families are not good or possible for them.
1.7.5.1. Con: Allowing a child to do field work to support his or her family is inhumane, and contradictory to international child labor laws. If we placed a heavier emphasis on implementing existing technology, farmers would have machines to perform agricultural tasks and children could attend school.
1.7.6. Con: The fact that a part of the population prefers small families does not justify the use of legislation to enforce this behavior.
1.7.7. Pro: We shouldn't have to tell a child the previous generation depleted something they would have enjoyed had there been less people over consuming it before they were born. This will not always be possible, but should be striven for.
1.7.8. Con: Families with three or more children are far more likely to be very [happy](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/families-with-three-or-more-children-are-the-happiest-report-reveals-10294043.html) than families with just one or two children.
1.7.8.1. Con: However, that may only be true when families are economically able to support more children, such in first world countries like [Europe](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/families-with-three-or-more-children-are-the-happiest-report-reveals-10294043.html). For families struggling economically, having more than three kids can be difficult to handle.
1.8. Pro: Population control is necessary not only to limit the number of people, but also to guide selection pressures.
1.8.1. Con: Governments already guide selection pressures through their social and economic policies. In other words, the current selection pressures - or lack thereof - are the result of state power. It does not make sense to increase state power in the hopes that the same political process that led to the current situation will lead to better outcomes if the state obtains the power to control reproduction more directly.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Welfare is a forced resource transfer to mostly low-IQ welfare recipients, allowing them to maintain or even improve their lifestyles when having children. This eliminates the selection pressure that favors economically successful individuals, and may even reverse it, thus selecting for traits that lead people to become welfare dependents.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Poor low IQ individuals in the third world manage to sustain breathtakingly high fertility rates. It is not clear that reducing subsidies for them in the developed world would reduce their fertility.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Con: Having many children is not the same as raising them. If most of the children starve to death or die from other preventable causes, this is a consequence of lack of resources. While reducing subsidies may not affect the number of children born, it would certainly reduce population.
1.8.1.1.1.1.1. Con: African population is expected to grow 2x within 50 years because even though lacking in resources by western standards, they have more than sufficient to keep children alive at well above the reproduction rate
1.8.1.1.1.2. Con: Different populations on earth respond to resource shortages differently. There are likely evolutionary reasons for this. Some groups reduce family size as a result, but other groups make no adjustments at all.
1.8.1.1.2. Pro: IQ [correlates closely with income](https://pumpkinperson.com/2016/02/11/the-incredible-correlation-between-iq-income/), and the average IQ of welfare recipients is about 90. IQ is the best single predictor of income, and [accounts for up to 25%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Income) of the variance in income between US citizens.
1.8.1.1.2.1. Con: A  [study](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533002760278686) that further examined non-IQ factors' impact on income, concluded that  an individual's location, inherited wealth, race, and schooling are [more important](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#IQ_testing_and_the_Eugenics_movement_in_the_United_States) in determining income than IQ.
1.8.1.1.2.1.1. Con: This study tries to explain how income earning capability is transferred between generations. In this context, factors other than IQ are more important, but that does not mean that they are overall more important than IQ for an individual's income. On the contrary, in the article it says that "\[e\]conomic  status  does  persist  substantially  across  generations."
1.8.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: The [study](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533002760278686) concludes that “America may still be the land of opportunity by some measures, but parental income and wealth are strong predictors of the likely economic status of the next generation”, asserting that “wealth,  race  and  schooling  are  important  to  the  inheritance  of economic status, but IQ is not a major contributor, and, as we have seen above, the genetic transmission of IQ is even less important”.
1.8.1.1.2.1.3. Con: This study takes into account extreme environmental impacts, like South-Africa under apartheid or North Korea, where it is correct that IQ has less of an impact. In free competence based societies however, IQ is the [biggest contributor to income inequality](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED429148). If the same household has children of different IQ levels, then the high IQ children are better off. High IQ children of poor families \(from the same towns\) fare better than low IQ children of richer families, etc. etc.
1.8.1.1.2.2. Con: [Poverty](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615612727) has been shown to reduce cognitive abilities, thus [reducing](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/poverty-dampens-genetic-influence-on-iq-in-the-us.html) someone's IQ.
1.8.1.1.2.3. Con: Economist [Garett Jones](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15582159.2017.1345242) estimates that "IQ accounts for only about [10%](https://humanvarieties.org/2016/01/31/iq-and-permanent-income-sizing-up-the-iq-paradox/) of variance in personal income".
1.8.1.1.3. Con: A large [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4641149/) asserts that “family socioeconomic status \(SES\) impacts children's development of intelligence from infancy through adolescence” thus suggesting “a meaningful relationship between IQ growth and socioeconomic factors”.
1.8.1.1.4. Con: Many welfare programs in Europe are conditioned to citizens having been [productive](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/10391238/Benefits-in-Europe-country-by-country.html) first and many are time-limited. Therefore, recipients can receive welfare provisions such unemployment benefits or healthcare if they have worked previously and have paid taxes \(or are dependent on someone who has\).
1.8.1.1.5. Pro: Rewarding laziness through welfare and punishing work through taxation seems to work quite effectively.
1.8.1.2. Con: Voters are more likely to accept limitations on their procreation than cuts to welfare programs. In democratic countries, a sensible eugenics programs can succeed where one of reducing dysgenic government programs, like welfare, cannot.
1.8.1.3. Pro: Marriage laws and family court rulings that incentivize divorce for women also disincentivize procreation within marriage for men. This especially affects men with high conscientiousness, who want a stable marriage within which to have children.
1.8.1.3.1. Pro: Most divorces in the Western world are initiated by women, and only a tiny fraction of those divorces are sought because of the husband's fault.
1.8.1.3.2. Pro: Even after no-fault divorces, the ex-husbands are often bound to provide alimony to their ex-wives, and custody of children is given to the ex-wife by default, entitling her to child support payments as well.
1.8.1.3.2.1. Con: In the US, several states have passed [laws](https://www.divorcenet.com/resources/divorce/for-men/divorce-for-men-why-women-get-child-custody-over-80-time) stating that there is no [custody](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/05/men_s_rights_recognized_the_pro_father_evolution_of_divorce_and_paternity.html) preference for women over men. If women still get custody more often is because laws use the standard of “best interests of the child” thus taking into account who is the primary caregiver. As women are in many cases more often the primary [caregiver](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/cathy-meyer/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115.html), they are given custody.
1.8.1.3.2.2. Con: 91 percent of child custody after divorce is decided by the parents with no [interference](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/cathy-meyer/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115.html) from the family court system. Among those, in  51% of the cases both parents agreed that the mother should have custody of the children.
1.8.1.3.3. Pro: Conscientiousness, as one of the Big Five personality traits, is heritable at about [40-60%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5068715/).
1.8.1.3.4. Con: Conscientious persons tend to have a more [stable relationship](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-therapy/201608/how-your-personality-predicts-your-romantic-life).
1.8.1.4. Con: We expect those in the position of responsibility to take care for their mistakes.
1.8.1.4.1. Pro: That is why opposition parties always point out the failure of incumbents. They hope to get elected instead of the incumbent.
1.8.1.5. Pro: The welfare state necessitates that middle-class people are taxed substantially in order to provide benefits for poor people. This taxation reduces their disposable income, wherefore they have fewer resources to provide for their own children. This acts as a selection pressure, because it reduces the number of children born to people who tend to be hard-working, responsible and smart.
1.8.1.6. Pro: In the US, not only are [unintended pregnancies](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1506575#t=articleResults) more prevalent among lower-income and less educated women \(which are associated with lower IQ\), but the percentage of those pregnancies resulting in birth is higher.
1.8.1.6.1. Con: Data shows that Comprehensive Sexual Education can decrease teen pregnancies. In fact, abstinence-only programs, common in the US, have been evidenced to [increase](http://www.siecus.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Feature.showFeature&featureID=1041) teen pregnancy rates, which probably explains why teen pregnancies are higher in the US that in other comparable countries.
1.8.1.6.1.1. Pro: The US, where abstinence-only education has been well funded and is common, has high teenage pregnancy rates compared to other developed countries \([Stranger-Hall and Hall, Table 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3194801/)\)
1.8.1.6.1.2. Pro: The Netherlands, where there is mandatory sexual education, has the lowest teenage pregnancy rate in the EU \(3 teenage pregnancies per 1000 teenage girls\), the second lowest rate is in Finland this number is 6,2/1000 and Austria has the third lowest rate with 7,7/1000. The USA still has the highest teenage pregnancy rate of all developed countries with 34,3/1000.
1.8.2. Con: Selective pressures should not be put on by government policy, because no central authority should have the power to determine which genetics are desirable. Instead, we should allow people to thrive and reproduce according to their own merits.
1.8.2.1. Pro: Governments are notoriously bad at managing incentives in complex systems, for example the economy: policies are driven by what is seen, but ignore the non-obvious destructive effects a change in incentives has. A focus on maximizing IQ could, for example, lead to the loss of other, equally important traits like conscientiousness, industriousness, inventiveness or health.
1.8.3. Pro: Without population controls for certain groups the general IQ of a society will decrease.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Intelligence is [inheritable](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/06/184853.1), at [about 0.6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ).
1.8.3.2. Con: The higher fertility of lower-IQ people may be explained by limited social mobility. Therefore, social policies, not birth control policies, may be sufficient.
1.8.3.2.1. Pro: Individuals with low IQ are more [fertile](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10842506) than those with high IQ. Without regulation or selective pressures.
1.8.3.2.1.1. Con: The same study also points out that "if women had the number of children they consider ideal, dysgenic fertility would be reduced" thus pointing to cultural and social aspects that if addressed \(e.g. better education, improved social conditions, better access to contraception, etc.\) would probably reduce this outcome without needing population controls.
1.8.3.2.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.8.1.6.1.
1.8.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.8.3.2.1.
1.8.3.4. Con: Humans consume resources no matter what their IQ.
1.8.3.4.1. Con: If a person develops a new form of recycling or renewable energy then their net resource consumption could be considered negative.
1.8.3.4.1.1. Con: For a person to achieve that creation, previous resources \(such as education\) must have been used.
1.8.3.4.1.1.1. Con: In 2017, education is not a consumable. Therefore, it does not increase issues of resource sustainability.
1.8.3.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Educating the population can only serve to benefit the greater good. Anomalous children may be born, but without proper education, they will be unable to attain the breakthroughs in science and technology that are so desperately needed to save the environment.
1.8.3.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: Today, environmental awareness and education can be provided at little or no cost with the use of the Internet. We no longer live in a time period in which only the wealthiest/most elite can become highly educated, and so education is no longer holds the same commodity value as it did prior to the 21st century.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2. Pro: For education to happen, generally a school needs to be built. Once built, it  needs resources \(paper, photocopy machines, office consumables, water, heating...\) and it also needs teachers, who need to have been educated first \(therefore also consuming resources\) and they need to be transported to the school.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con: Physical schools and their consumables \(buses, gas, textbooks\) are no longer needed to achieve a satisfactory education. The Internet now enables people to learn from home at all different levels - by way of online higher education, as well as self-education through DIY videos.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2.1.1. Pro: The Internet now enables people to learn from home at all different levels - by way of online higher education, as well as self-education through DIY videos. If an online educated person can consume net zero \(or negative\) resources, then their education will not have caused depletion - even if some materials were used to get them there.
1.8.3.4.2. Pro: Economically active people necessarily use more resources, as they consume for their social and their business needs. Not concentrating on total population size will miss total resource consumption.
1.8.4. Con: All humans have an equal right to have children as they are all entitled to bodily autonomy.
1.8.4.1. Con: This claim is only valid if the person does not live in a welfare state. All humans can only be valued as equal in a 'Libertarian utopia' whereby no individual ever has to subsidise another. Once subsidies/welfare are introduced, then some individuals are obviously worth more to the group.
1.8.5. Pro: Human beings are just as subject to evolution as the rest of nature. We are a part of nature, and we are either evolving in a positive direction or in a negative one.
1.9. Con: Imposing methods of population control is a slippery slope, and can lead to more oppressive ways of controlling the population.
1.9.1. Pro: Population control touches on individual's human reproduction and is therefore highly intrusive. Once established this desensitize society and allows for further intrusions of a lower scale.
1.9.2. Pro: It is almost impossible to do this in the time scales required without draconian measures.
1.9.3. Pro: When a law is made it is ultimately enforced by use of force. The only hope for humanity is voluntary and naturally evolving into a better version of itself. It is going to be a long hard road we may not survive but we have to try. Giving authorities the ability to infringe on others basic human rights is not the answer. Human civilization has greatly improved, but government agencies persecuting and prosecuting families for having illegal children is not going to help.
1.9.3.1. Con: We are the authorities we elect, and we are the ones creating and destroying rights.
1.9.4. Con: Omitting all methods of population control can lead to equally oppressive outcomes such as wars for resources, prohibition of certain types of consumption, suspension of consumer liberties, etc...
1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.
1.10. Pro: Humans are doomed to extinction due to overpopulation.
1.10.1. Con: -> See discussion #9226: Global overpopulation is a myth.
1.11. Con: Some countries are below replacement rates. Further declining their population growth could lead to negative social and economical outcomes.
1.11.1. Pro: Reducing population would place even more strain on social programs that primarily serve the elderly such as Social Security. With fewer children per generation, the working tax base is smaller for social programs that provide for an aging population. This demographic shift is already causing strain in the U.S., Japan, and other developed countries facing an aging population.
1.11.1.1. Con: This would only be a problem if the population \(of a given country\) shrinks too quickly.
1.11.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.6.2.1.2.
1.11.2. Pro: The governments which would be most able logistically to implement population control are those where it is least necessary for global overpopulation.
1.11.3. Con: The population control should be applied in countries that have a fertility rate above the replacement level.
1.11.4. Pro: With rapidly evolving technology in fields touching human sustainability, it is very difficult to determine which population number we're supposed to be aiming for.
1.12. Pro: Since having children is an economic choice, countries should agree on removing subsidies and tax benefits directed at increasing the population.
1.12.1. Con: Any controls aimed at punishing the parents for excess children \(taxes/fines/even social stigma\) will ultimately affect the \(innocent\) children.
1.12.2. Pro: Germany, the UK, and the US offer a [child tax credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_tax_credit), which in some way decreases one's taxes by having children.
1.12.2.1. Con: [Despite their efforts](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/study-german-efforts-to-increase-birthrate-a-failure-a-873635.html), the German birthrate has remained around 1.4-1.5.
1.12.3. Pro: Some countries offer a [baby bonus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_bonus), in which the government gives a specified amount of money to the family for having a child.
1.12.4. Con: Having children is more an emotional and less of an economic choice. It is a complex choice.
1.12.4.1. Pro: The reasons for having children change from culture to culture.
1.12.4.2. Pro: Religious people do not think of having children as their choice.
1.12.4.3. Con: Having children is unwise and sometimes even not possible in poor economic conditions, for the well-being of the children themselves and that of the parents.
1.12.4.3.1. Pro: Japanese people cite the cost of having children in Japan – a country which deals with a decreasing population due to very low birth rates – as one of the main [reasons](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/07/japan-mystery-low-birth-rate/534291/) for not having them.
1.12.4.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.2.2.
1.13. Pro: Population control would reduce unwanted children and result in greater social stability later on.
1.13.1. Pro: Due to outdated education systems in many countries, poor families give birth to many children, which grow up deprived of basic needs \(food, shelter\) and commit to illegal activities in order to live.
1.13.2. Pro: In present day China, every single child was wanted by their parents. Poor parenting still occurs, but far less so. This leads to less criminal activity, and much higher familial investment in their offspring's education - raising national productivity of human capital and further decreasing crime.
1.13.3. Con: -> See 1.11.4.
1.13.4. Pro: -> See discussion #2368: A license should be required in order to have a child (procreate).
1.13.5. Con: Population control such as China's single child policy has shown the consumption on unnecessary adornment for the single child outstrips the collective consumption spend on larger families. The claim also has a rural and urban location underpinning it.
1.14. Con: Human beings can provide solutions to human need.
1.14.1. Pro: Perceived resources limits on this planet \(a 'Malthusian crisis'\) have long been predicted and may be a long way off. The crisis is always averted by Boserupian \(technological\) progress. With that in mind, it may be the case that sufficient technology exists to be a space-bound species before this planet runs out.
1.14.1.1. Con: Even if technological progress temporarily averts the Malthusian crisis, there is no certainty that said technological progress does not come with its own host of problems.
1.14.1.1.1. Pro: Endocrine disruptors, greenhouse gases, and pollution are examples of disastrous side-effects of technological progress that brought short-term benefits to humankind.
1.14.1.2. Con: Accepting the depletion of Earth's resources & ability to sustain a human population because we might one day be able to colonize other planets doesn’t solve the problem. It will only exacerbate the problem here – leading to more human suffering – and perpetuate the problem on any of the rare habitable worlds that might be colonized. In other words, it’s like pushing the problem forward to future generations while we continue making a mess of things.
1.14.1.3. Con: There is no evidence that we will be able to meaningfully colonize other planets before overpopulation on Earth results in serious and widespread but preventable social, economic, and ecological problems.
1.14.1.4. Pro: [Technologies](http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/762844/FROZEN-IN-TIME-space-travel-planet-colony) such as pods that can sustain frozen humans, so they can endure interplanetary travel, are already being conceived.
1.14.1.4.1. Con: Cryonic patients are considered legally dead. There is no way of telling whether it will ever be possible to revive a cryopreserved human being, and the practice has been received much skepticism from the mainstream scientific community.
1.14.2. Con: As long as humans continue the production and use of non-renewable resources, we will not be able to reverse CO2 emissions. Atmospheric temperatures and ocean levels will continue to rise, and the environment will become unsustainable.
1.14.2.1. Pro: China’s coal consumption grew by four percent to 2.75 billion tonnes in 2013 accounting for over half of the world’s total coal consumption in the year. [mining-technology.com](http://www.mining-technology.com/features/featurethe-worlds-biggest-coal-consumers-4353695/)
