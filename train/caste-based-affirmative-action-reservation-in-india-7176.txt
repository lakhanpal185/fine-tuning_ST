1.10.3. Pro: Using caste as the basis for reservation is neither just nor efficient. Level of income of the family \(not caste of the family\) is what determines the opportunities a child has. Family income determines for a child what school he goes to, whether he can afford textbooks, whether he can avail after school help\(tution/coaching\), whether he has access to nutritious food for cognitive development.
