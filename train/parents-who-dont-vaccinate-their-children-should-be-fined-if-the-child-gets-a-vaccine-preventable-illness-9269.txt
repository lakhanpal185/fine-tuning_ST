Discussion Title: Parents Who Don't Vaccinate Their Children Should Be Fined If The Child Gets A Vaccine-Preventable Illness

1. Parents Who Don't Vaccinate Their Children Should Be Fined If The Child Gets A Vaccine-Preventable Illness.
1.1. Pro: Using laws to set norms about expectations in society is exactly what governments do.
1.1.1. Pro: If people do not wish to abide by the norms the government sets, they pay the penalty and move on.
1.1.1.1. Con: Rich parents are better able to afford to pay the fine and so can afford the risk more than poor parents can.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Fines can be adjusted relative to a person's income.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Healthcare costs, which will include vaccination, are to be [adjusted to the person's income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Germany#Public_insurance).
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: For rich parents this fine simply becomes internalized as a fee and holds no deterrent value. In fact, when fines are created they can often act to [increase](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/feb/23/brain-food-fines-and-fees) the number of instances of the action they are trying to deter.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: This only means that healthcare systems are to be reformed [in a way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Germany#Public_insurance) that would allow free vaccination for everyone, alongside with other necessary healthcare services.
1.1.1.2. Con: Legal penalties carry social censure in addition to fines, which makes their norm setting coercive.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: There is already a strong norm in favour of vaccination in most western countries. The minority of parents who choose to go against this norm already feel strongly enough to weather the social backlash of going against a societal norm. Given this strength of belief, a fine is unlikely to make them change their mind.
1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The fine is incentive. The money obtained with said fine could be used by the government to fund projects aiming to further people's health.
1.1.2. Con: Governments should mimic the norms of their citizens, rather than vice versa, as governments are supposed to be representative of their citizens.
1.1.2.1. Con: Governments should also seek to act as role models for the greater population by implementing ways to incorporate ideas that are beneficial to society
1.1.2.2. Con: If the government mimicked the norms of its citizens then it would put this new law in place as it is in accordance with what the majority does.
1.1.3. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.4. Pro: Even if there is not a significant uptick in the vaccination rate, there is value in the government expressing disapproval at parents who put their kids in danger.
1.1.4.1. Pro: The expression of government disapproval serves as a signalling effect to parents about what is and isn't responsible parenting, regardless of whether parents have the right to carry out irresponsible behaviour or not.
1.1.4.2. Con: Distrust of vaccines is often [rooted](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/03/anti-vaccines-trust-government_n_6604708.html) in a similar skepticism of one's government. For many anti-vaxxers, government condemnation of their position is simply more validation that they made the correct choice for their children.
1.1.5. Pro: Because children have neither the capability nor experience to adequately speak for themselves, the government assumes the mantle to advocate for their interests.
1.1.5.1. Con: Parents usually have the legal and moral authority to act as surrogates for their children.
1.1.5.1.1. Pro: Until the child reaches the age of majority, the parents _do_ have the legal duty to consent on the child’s behalf. It is abridged, only in dire circumstances, and only after judicial review.
1.1.5.1.2. Pro: Permission of the parents is first required in order to carry out medical procedures on those under the age of 18.
1.1.5.1.2.1. Con: In many jurisdictions, courts can overrule parents' decisions, and in some cases there are certain procedures that courts must approve in advance.
1.1.5.1.2.1.1. Con: The fact that the state "can" do something doesn't make it right.
1.1.5.1.2.1.2. Pro: In Australia, state Supreme Courts have parens patriae jurisdiction \(the power to make decisions for those unable to make them themselves\), and Family Courts have welfare provisions [allowing them to intervene to determine the proper course of medical treatment for a minor](http://www.healthlawcentral.com/decisions/consent-minors/).
1.1.5.1.2.1.3. Pro: In Australia, there are certain medical procedures that require the decision of a court to perform.
1.1.5.1.2.1.3.1. Pro: The sterilisation of a young person with an intellectual disability [requires court approval](http://www.healthlawcentral.com/decisions/consent-minors/).
1.1.5.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: The termination of a minor who is not Gillick competent's pregnancy [requires court approval](https://jade.io/article/83861).
1.1.5.1.2.1.3.3. Pro: Both hormone treatment for gender identity disorder and sex reassignment surgery [require court approval](http://www.healthlawcentral.com/decisions/consent-minors/) if the patient is a minor.
1.1.5.1.2.1.3.4. Pro: The withdrawal of medical treatment from a child [requires court approval](https://aifs.gov.au/publications/citizen-child-australian-law-and-childrens-rights/8-medical-procedures-children).
1.1.5.1.2.2. Con: This is not always, or even usually, the case. In many countries, the age of medical consent is lower \(16, or even younger\), and children can consent to medical treatments even below that age.
1.1.5.1.2.2.1. Con: The key point here is "consent". Whatever the legal age requirement, the decision to vaccinate is a personal one, and the mandatory vaccination is an egregious violation of the right to informed consent.
1.1.5.1.2.2.2. Pro: In most jurisdictions, adolescents can consent to certain medical treatments without the consent of their parents, and courts and laws can overrule parental decisions \(for example, to require that a child receive a blood transfusion against parental wishes\) where the health of the child is at stake. This is hardly an unrestricted authority.
1.1.5.1.2.2.2.1. Con: In the matter of blood transfusions, an emergency order must be entered by a judge.
1.1.5.1.2.2.2.2. Con: In Florida, a minor may only consent to treatment for an STI, or pregnancy.
1.1.5.1.2.2.2.3. Pro: In the UK, girls have to [consent](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/hpv-vaccination-parents-rights.aspx) to being vaccinated. If they refuse, the parents cannot override their decision.
1.1.5.1.2.2.2.4. Pro: In the UK, children below the age of medical consent who are [Gillick competent](https://www.nspcc.org.uk/preventing-abuse/child-protection-system/legal-definition-child-rights-law/gillick-competency-fraser-guidelines/) can consent to medical treatment, including if their parents disagree with their decision.
1.1.5.1.2.2.2.5. Pro: In Australia, children below the age of medical consent who are [Gillick competent](http://www.healthlawcentral.com/decisions/consent-minors/) can consent to medical treatment, including if their parents disagree with their decision.
1.1.5.1.3. Con: Child car seats had to be enforced by the government, as many parents did not buy them.
1.1.5.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.5.1.2.2.2.
1.1.5.2. Con: Parents are in the unique position of knowing their child closely on an individual level. This means that they are in the best position to know what is in the best interest of their child.
1.1.5.2.1. Con: Parents are often emotive in their decision making rather than rational. They are more likely to be swayed by questionable but emotive anti-vaccine sources than medical professionals who are better able to discern scientific evidence from pseudoscience.
1.1.5.2.2. Con: Most parents are not medical specialists and have no special sixth sense to know what is good for their child and what not \(medically speaking\).
1.1.5.2.3. Con: It's unclear what special knowledge a parent has about their child at two months \(when most doctors recommend children be vaccinated against polio\) in terms of deciding whether or not to vaccinate their child that a medical professional also would not have.
1.1.5.3. Con: Governments can only act _in loco parentis_ or “in place of the parents.” The decision making role lies with the child’s parent or guardian.
1.1.5.3.1. Con: Parents can't break the law in their decisions on behalf of the state and child.
1.1.5.3.2. Con: The decision of a parent might be detrimental to a child. The government can step in before this detriment occurs.
1.1.5.4. Con: There are other "hot issues" that are in direct conflict with the government protecting children. If - in the case of pro-choice - it is "my body, my choice",  \(and the government clearly does not assume the mantle to advocate for the child\), what makes vaccinations any more compelling of an interest for government intervention?
1.1.5.4.1. Con: With Abortion there isn't a "child" with vaccination there is a child.
1.1.5.5. Pro: All children are property \(wards\) of the state, parents are employed in a legal guardian capacity over children on behalf of the state, a role qualified by observance of a number of legal duties enforced by the state.
1.1.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.7. Con: A current norm in our society is to challenge the hegemony of professionals, including medics. One acute situation is the treatment of women during pregnancy and labour, resulting in a lack of trust in the health system. Addressing the behaviour of the health system that results in a lack of trust may be far more effective in encouraging vaccination. Forcing vaccination may result in further trauma, and exclusion of some groups from having a voice in what our societies norms are.
1.1.8. Con: Public burping or picking in your nose has to do with society norms and expectations but legally regulating them would be absurd. So the parent argument is wrong.
1.1.8.1. Con: Picking your nose and burping don't cause children to get sick. Vaccinations are in the interest of the child and society as they have a clear benefit for being implemented. Burping and picking your nose are benign actions that don't harm or help society.
1.1.9. Pro: Some education systems don't encourage vaccination e.g. Steiner schools.
1.1.10. Con: In most instances the law opts to punish disobedience rather than reward the law abiding, the case for catching more flies with honey should be exhausted before we resort to fines.
1.1.10.1. Con: The reward obtained by following the law \(if it were to become one\) would be that the parent saved their child from getting sick by/dying to a preventable illness while also decreasing the chance that that illness continues to survive.
1.1.11. Con: When Governments "set norms about expectations in society", they do so with threats of violence in response to non-compliance. Threatening violence is an unethical way to "set norms about expectations."
1.1.11.1. Con: The primary question is one of fines, not threats of violence.
1.1.12. Pro: Using monetary tools by the government has worked in the past. Carrying it a step forward, by making parents liable for damages \(as with parents not locking up firearms\) has had a positive impact on securing guns. There is still work to do, but it seems to be moving forward.
1.2. Con: Fines are ineffective in changing behavior of those opposed to vaccines.
1.2.1. Con: Some parents don't vaccinate their children because they never get around to it, rather than being opposed to vaccines. Potentially incurring a fine increases the importance and urgency of getting their children vaccinated and makes them more likely to prioritise doing it.
1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.2.1.
1.2.3. Con: Fines are commonly used to incentivize many behaviors around the world, such as getting vehicles inspected and as punitive measures for things like speeding and drunk driving. If the fines are stiff enough, many people would indeed change their decisions.
1.2.4. Pro: Fines will reinforce the belief some hold that the government is beholden to special interests lying about vaccine safety.
1.2.5. Pro: Punishment builds resentment and does nothing to encourage compliance. We give traffic tickets to speeders yet people still speed.
1.2.5.1. Con: Punishment for speeding is an incentive. If that incentive is followed is up to the driver but it is there. If there wasn't a fine on speeding then there would most likely be a marginal if not large increase in speeders.
1.2.6. Pro: For many, the cost of a fine is less than the cost of abandoning their principles.
1.2.6.1. Pro: Principles are based upon an individual's fundamental beliefs that, to that individual, are more important than social systems or bureaucracy.
1.2.7. Con: While there are some people who are passionately against vaccinations there are also a great number of people who are on the fence in regards to the decision. The introduction of a fine could push many of them to the vaccine side.
1.2.7.1. Pro: Those who are concerned about vaccinations usually root their ideology in perceived government [corruption](https://medium.com/the-method/8-common-arguments-against-vaccines-5d45ad9c1e29) with big pharma. This could be seen as further laws passed in order to boost sales.
1.2.8. Con: The initial assertion says that parents should be fined when their child gets the disease, not at the time of vaccine refusal. In that scenario, the point of the fine is not to change the parent's behavior, but presumably to punish them, and call attention to their example to change the behavior of others.
1.3. Pro: Potentially incurring a fine will make some parents more likely to vaccinate their children.
1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.2.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.3.3. Pro: Potentially incurring a fine changes the risk-benefit calculus of parents when they consider whether or not to vaccinate their children. It increases the weight of the risk they undertake when they do not vaccinate their children.
1.3.4. Con: If parents fear serious health complications should they vaccinate their child, potentially having to pay a fee won't change their mind.
1.3.4.1. Pro: A fine is a minor inconvenience in comparison to their belief that their child's health will be irrevocably damaged because of a vaccine.
1.3.4.2. Pro: In spite of the fact that numerous [studies](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/upshot/not-up-for-debate-the-science-behind-vaccination.html) have been conducted on the safety of vaccines, the belief that they are not remains [prevalent](http://time.com/3701543/measles-vaccines-poll-anti-vaxxers/) in the US. If years of having anti-vaccine theories debunked hasn't swayed the individual in question, it's unlikely a fine will.
1.3.4.3. Pro: The original point of debate states that fines should be imposed "if the child gets a vaccine preventable disease". At that point, however, it would be cruel to charge fines to those parents, and pointless - if the safe-being of their child doesn't persuade them, monetary punishment will hardly work.
1.3.5. Pro: Doctors will no longer discuss vaccines with their patients as if they were optional, meaning parents will no longer view vaccines as an unnecessary action.
1.3.5.1. Con: The imposition of such a fine is not the same as making vaccines compulsory. Doctors already have an incentive to mention vaccines to parents because they get paid for each vaccination administered.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: Vaccines are a very low-margin\(and high-liability\) portion of running a physician's office, so much so that many family practitioners are choosing to refer patients to the health department, or Walgreen's, for their immunizations. [ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2975685/)
1.3.5.2. Con: If parents feel pressured to vaccinate their children each time they visit the doctor they may stop bringing their child to the doctor entirely in order to avoid such pressuring.
1.3.5.3. Con: This is just not correct. Doctors would still have to give parents the option, and obtain informed consent. Parents will still have to be told of risks, benefits, side effects---and fines---and accept or decline the vaccine
1.3.6. Con: There are countless other incentives which are pre-existing for parents to vaccinate their children. Many schools only allow enrollment, for instance, after the child is vaccinated for common illnesses. It is unlikely that parents making rational calculi will be convinced uniquely by a fine.
1.3.6.1. Con: It is incentive nonetheless.
1.3.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.7.
1.3.8. Con: For many people simply paying a fee is [preferable](https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/rsa-blogs/2014/01/the-problem-with-fines-is-that-they-can-turn-into-fees) to the emotional penalty of feeling ashamed or guilty. The introduction of a fine may alleviate any potential guilt felt by parents who don't vaccinate.
1.3.8.1. Con: If this feeling of guilt leads to more vaccinated children, then that is a good outcome.
1.3.8.2. Con: Governments use societal shame to get people to do things all the time.
1.3.8.2.1. Pro: The shame that comes with being seen as a criminal is a very strong deterrent for most people.
1.3.8.2.1.1. Con: Most speeders are deterred by the fine and associated costs of a ticket more than the concept of shame.
1.3.8.2.1.2. Con: Anti-vaxxers tend to be extremely distrustful of governments, and consequently would view flouting this law as civil disobedience \(i.e., protesting what they see as government overreach into their private lives\). This means they will regard this crime in a far more positive light than other offenses, such as thievery or arson.
1.3.8.2.2. Con: People tend to self-select into social circles of like-minded people. Parents against vaccination will likely have many friends also against vaccination who will applaud, rather than shame them, for sticking to their beliefs and doing what they believe will best protect their children.
1.3.8.2.2.1. Pro: Given the increasingly widespread acceptance of vaccines these days, those in the minority against them tend to form tight-knit support communities and lobbying groups.
1.3.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: [Interest](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/aug/26/california-home-school-vaccine-law) in home-schooling has increased in California, which recently passed a law mandating vaccines for schoolchildren, for example.
1.3.8.2.2.2. Pro: Parents would be more likely to be shamed by their anti-vaccine peers for going against their beliefs and doing what they believe will endanger their children.
1.3.8.2.3. Con: The shame parents feel would likely originate from their child catching an illness that a decision to vaccinate could have prevented. There is no reason to believe that being forced to pay the fine would be the significant source of shame.
1.3.8.2.4. Con: As governments moved away from stocks and pillories, and public health executions, shame became less of a factor.
1.3.8.2.5. Pro: Publishing a list of vaccine objectors would then reduce the numbers in the future.
1.4. Con: The fact that [their child is going to die](http://www.vaccineinformation.org/personal-testimonies/) of said illness is often enough to get them to [use vaccines in the future](https://www.today.com/parents/her-son-died-vaccine-preventable-disease-heres-what-she-wants-t2771).
1.4.1. Con: Not all vaccine preventable illnesses are fatal. Nor is every infection a death sentence.
1.4.2. Con: Many parents are influenced by inaccurate reports which invalidate vaccines. These people may still believe vaccines are dangerous even if their child is sick.
1.4.2.1. Pro: If they believe that vaccines are dangerous they may be unwilling to put their child at more risk after being seriously ill.
1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.
1.4.2.3. Pro: The widespread fear that vaccines increase risk of autism originated with a [1997 study](http://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/vaccine-myths-debunked/) published by Andrew Wakefield, a British surgeon. The paper has since been completely discredited due to serious procedural errors, undisclosed financial conflicts of interest, and ethical violations. Despite this many parents today still believe that there is a link between autism and vaccines due to this article.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: A comprehensive [review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14006367) of 10 different studies, using data from 1.2 million children, was carried out in 2014 and did not find any relationship between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder.
1.4.2.3.2. Pro: Donald Trump has supported this belief through [tweeting](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/vaccines-are-they-safe-to-give-children-dangers-advice-facts-mmr-autism-donald-trump-anti-vaxxers-a7719491.html): “Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes - AUTISM. Many such cases!”
1.4.3. Pro: It may be less cruel to fine all parents who do not vaccinate their children rather than only the ones with sick children. Those whose children are ill are already incurring negative results from their decision.
1.4.3.1. Pro: The point here is to be EFFECTIVE \(i.e. to encourage more vaccination\), rather than to be CRUEL/punitive, after-the-fact.
1.4.4. Pro: Parents will already be forced to pay medical bills for their child, so the financial incentives of a fine aren't unique.
1.4.5. Con: Voluntarily unvaccinated children are more of a danger to other children who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. Fines are meant to proactively encourage parents to vaccinate their children.
1.4.6. Con: Risking or sacrificing a child's life to teach the importance of vaccines to parents is immoral.
1.5. Con: Fines disproportionately punish poorer individuals.
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.5.3. Pro: Rich parents will have choice, whereas poorer parents will be denied any real freedom to choose. This creates a two- \(or more\) tiered system of access.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Poor parents against vaccines will be disproportionately punished for standing by their principles because they are less able to afford to pay the fine. Many may vaccinate their children against their beliefs because of this, while rich parents can afford to take the risk.
1.5.3.1.1. Con: Children from poor families are more likely to be unable to access good medical care, and thus would benefit more from being vaccinated.
1.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.
1.5.4. Pro: Individuals of low socio-economic status may decide that the cost of a vaccine isn't worth the trade off for basic material goods, especially given the low probability of catching an illness. This is a rational decision which the law should not punish.
1.5.4.1. Con: Recommended vaccines are covered by private & government health insurance plans\(Medicaid, in the case of the poor in the U.S.\) so the "cost of vaccine" shouldn't figure into the decision of whether to vaccinate.
1.5.5. Con: Cost of avoiding vaccinations can cost society significantly more.
1.5.5.1. Con: The cost to taxpayers, when divided per person, is likely to be significantly lower than the cost of vaccinations or the fine to a poor individual.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: The parent comment doesn't talk about the individual taxpayer but he talks about all the taxpayers as a whole \(society\).
1.5.6. Pro: Access to vaccinations depends on access to affordable, quality health care, and many people do not have access to that.
1.5.6.1. Pro: A measure like this would unfairly target marginalized groups, particularly those in poverty, who may have less access to healthcare \(because of proximity, transportation, money\). They would be hit with fines that they are unable to pay, rather than the assistance they need to get these services.
1.5.6.2. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.
1.6. Con: One provider may not mean the same thing as another, even when using the same [ICD code](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/1431725/). Therefore, it is unfair to impose a fine without competent and impartial review of the medical record. Influenza is not the same thing as "flu like illness." Even a diagnosis of measles is subject to debate among ID specialists.
1.6.1. Con: This is a logistical argument which could be overcome by guidelines in the bill, clarifying how \(& by whom\) the diagnosis shall be supported. It's not an absolute rebuttal of the notion of fines for the offending diagnosis.
1.7. Pro: Vaccines rely upon [herd immunity](http://Should parents who don't vaccinate their children be fined if their children gets a vaccine-preventable illness?) to be maximally effective.
1.7.1. Pro: If people do not vaccinate their children, infectious diseases might re-establish themselves.
1.7.1.1. Pro: Diseases such as measles, mumps, and whooping cough have experienced a [resurgence](http://time.com/27308/4-diseases-making-a-comeback-thanks-to-anti-vaxxers/) in the US in recent years, thanks to anti-vaxxers.
1.7.2. Con: The original description of herd immunity referred to a population that was naturally infected with a given illness This typically confers a life-long immunity. Some authors have observed that vaccine-based immunity is not life-long, and thus does not provide true herd immunity. At least not as it was originally described. [vaccinationcouncil.org](http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/2012/02/18/the-deadly-impossibility-of-herd-immunity-through-vaccination-by-dr-russell-blaylock/)
1.7.2.1. Con: A herd immunity, even if temporary and artificial, e.g. flu shots, is valuable.
1.7.2.1.1. Con: In the matter of influenza vaccinations, the Cochrane review found no evidence that vaccinated individuals provide protection for unvaccinated individuals. This [article](http://www.cochrane.org/CD005187/ARI_influenza-vaccination-healthcare-workers-who-care-people-aged-60-or-older-living-long-term-care) is one example among many.
1.7.2.1.1.1. Con: The \(parent claim\) study is a pooled review of three clinical trials, which are all questioned for their unclear methods, as well as lack of compliance in the treatment arm \(i.e. the people being studied for efficacy of the flu shot, may not have actually gotten the flu shot.\)
1.7.2.1.2. Pro: [This](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24046301) 2014 study from Clinical Infectious Disease found evidence that immunizing healthcare workers against the flu does have a protective effect in reducing mortality rates of their patients in long-term care facilities and hospitals. The evidence was weaker, for a protective effect on morbidity.
1.7.2.2. Pro: This 1993 [article](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1150/f26ca43be04880eaf4ad046a1f9408cb2e11.pdf) from the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health emphasizes that confusion and controversy exist, including whether herd immunity exists at all.
1.7.2.2.1. Con: The cited link is to "semanticsschloar.org," and indeed the article is about semantics: the varying understandings, applications and connotations of the term 'herd immunity,' NOT about any serious question of whether it "exists at all."
1.7.2.3. Pro: In [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/5093648/) 1971 article, Fox et al state that emphasis on simple thresholds \[of vaccination\] is not appropriate for public health.
1.7.2.3.1. Con: \(The cited article is not available at the link given, BUT...\) This was a theoretical argument was based on mathematical modelling, which was criticized[elsewhere](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1150/f26ca43be04880eaf4ad046a1f9408cb2e11.pdf) for not allowing for things like birth rates and immigration, which continuously increase the number of susceptible individuals.
1.7.3. Con: Children do not have a moral obligation to protect one another. It is not the responsibility of children to undergo the potential risk of getting a vaccine for the benefit of another child.
1.7.3.1. Con: It is the government's responsibility to protect all of its citizens and so through this tax it would protect those vulnerable to preventable diseases.
1.7.3.1.1. Con: Governments cannot force someone to donate their organs, even if it will save the lives of others. Similarly, governments cannot force people to take risks with their own bodies in order to limit the risk to the bodies of others.
1.7.3.1.1.1. Con: Government already regulates blood alcohol levels in the name of safety to the community and the people.
1.7.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Regulating blood alcohol levels, to my knowledge, poses no risk of death or damage to the person being regulated.
1.7.3.1.2. Con: It is unfair to make a person suffer for another's benefit without their consent, as the person who suffers never gets to experience the benefit which their suffering allowed.
1.7.3.1.2.1. Pro: Other utilitarian policies, such as taxation, at least allow the individual who suffered to experience some of the aggregate benefit that resulted from their suffering. The person vaccinated experiences no benefit as a result of another person living.
1.7.3.2. Pro: Children have a moral obligation not to harm one another. Exposing other children to a deadly virus is harm.
1.7.3.3. Con: The moral obligation of the \(decision-making\) parent, not the child, is what is at issue here.
1.7.4. Con: -> See 1.7.3.1.2.
1.7.5. Con: -> See 1.7.3.1.1.
1.7.6. Con: [According to the CDC,](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/immunize.htm) vaccine rates remain high even without this policy, so the net change in herd immunity will be small.
1.7.7. Con: Herd immunity is only a factor for diseases that are easily and inadvertently spread person-to-person \(like the flu\). The herd-immunity argument has no bearing on something like tetanus \(i.e. your kid being vaccinated will not help my kid avoid stepping on a nail\). Non-vaxxers would argue that HPV and Hep B are not transmissible in the normal activities of grade-schoolers.
1.7.8. Pro: Unvaccinated children are a [potential danger](https://respectfulinsolence.com/2008/08/27/mixing-unvaccinated-children-with-unvacc/) to vaccinated children and especially to children who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical issues.
1.7.8.1. Con: -> See 1.7.3.
1.7.8.2. Pro: Individuals who cannot vaccinate themselves as a result of their faith or religion are more likely to get ill when there is no herd immunity.
1.7.8.3. Pro: Children who are too young to be vaccinated rely on herd immunity until they are old enough to be vaccinated themselves.
1.7.9. Con: Herd immunity is a common argument for mandating vaccinations but it is a myth, much like most vaccine science. People shouldn't be fined for not submitting to dangerous myths. [stopmandatoryvaccination.com](http://www.stopmandatoryvaccination.com/public-health/myth-4-herd-immunity/)
1.7.9.1. Con: While the cited source is biased, there exist simple mathematical models of [how and why](https://www.quantamagazine.org/flu-vaccines-and-the-math-of-herd-immunity-20180205/) herd immunity does work.
1.7.9.2. Con: Herd immunity exists. The above-cited webpage argues that b/c vaccinated populations are not 100% immune, they are actually at HIGHER risk of disease, than if they hadn't been vaccinated. This is not only incorrect, but it has nothing to do with herd immunity. \(First bullet point on the webpage: "over two dozen cases" of pertussis in 2009 among VACCINATED kids. No mention of the fact that in 2009 there were over 16,000 cases of pertussis nationwide, with higher risk among unvaccinated people\)
1.7.9.3. Con: The concept of herd immunity is that the UNVACCINATED individual is protected by the prevalence of immunity\(history of disease or vaccination\) around him/her. The citation in the above con lists examples of VACCINATION failure. To prove or disprove herd immunity, one should compare the rates of infection among the UNVACCINATED people in two populations: \(a\)high prevalence of vaccinated, vs. \(b\) low prevalence of vaccinated individuals
1.7.10. Pro: Herd immunity kicks in at around [85](http://www.thejournal.ie/vaccinations-should-you-get-them-1937370-Feb2015/)%. When taking into consideration people who can't be vaccinated due to medical reasons, this does not leave a large amount of people who can remain not vaccinated without affecting herd immunity.
1.7.10.1. Pro: [Reported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17032989?dopt=Abstract) "exemptions" from vaccination at school entry \(based on religion, choice or other\) are about 1-2.5%, and varies from state to state.
1.7.10.1.1. Con: Exemptions at school entry misses home-schooled kids. Parents may be choosing to home-school due to their objection to vaccinations.
1.7.10.2. Con: One number where herd immunity "kicks in" does not apply to all illnesses. Measles is highly contagious, and probably requires immunity rates of 95+%. Less contagious illnesses, especially those spread by more sexual contact or other specific behavior\(needles-sharing\), will require less levels of immunity\(because presumably I'm gonna have sex with FEWER people than I'm gonna breathe on, or shake hands with, in my lifetime\)
1.8. Con: Vaccines harm children more than the disease they prevent.
1.8.1. Pro: Vaccines are often rolled out quickly in response to sudden outbreaks of diseases. Sometimes these vaccines are not properly tested and can cause serious side effects.
1.8.1.1. Pro: 1 in 55,000 of the 6 million swine flu vaccines administered in the UK were found to have triggered [narcolepsy](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/19/swine-flu-vaccine-narcolepsy-uk).
1.8.1.1.1. Con: Not in the US.  [CDC studied](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320099) 8.5 million people given vaccines containing the A\(H1N1\)pdm09 virus strain used in the US and found no risk.
1.8.1.2. Pro: It was discovered that the Dengue fever vaccine rolled out in the Philipinnes can cause [death](http://www.dw.com/en/dengue-risks-and-side-effects-of-the-worlds-first-vaccine/a-42488407) in those who have not already experienced Dengue fevers.
1.8.1.3. Con: If vaccines are being rolled out quickly, it is likely because there is a massive health crisis. Clearly, people ought to get the vaccine in these instances or else contagion can spread rapidly.
1.8.1.3.1. Con: Individuals who died as a result of taking vaccines would have been better off taking their chances with the illness.
1.8.1.4. Con: This might be true in a potential future doomsday scenario, but that's not how the flu vaccine works. The way the influenza vaccine works: it's the same suspension year after year, studied carefully, tested rigorously, given to hundreds of millions of people, improved slowly and incrementally, and tracked longitudinally for decades. The only thing that changes is the surface antigen markers on the flu strains each year.
1.8.1.5. Con: New vaccines for "new" epidemics \(i.e. ebolavirus\) are not applicable to the parent proposition. I presume that "parents who don't vaccinate their children" refers to the the standard set of "routine" childhood immunizations, which rarely changes. The most recent addition was the HPV vaccine, after years of study. Prior to that the most recent addition was HBV in 1992. Neither of these was hastily "rolled out."
1.8.2. Pro: Despite being rare, vaccines do have recorded side effects
1.8.2.1. Pro: On [rare occasions](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/vaccines-are-they-safe-to-give-children-dangers-advice-facts-mmr-autism-donald-trump-anti-vaxxers-a7719491.html) the polio vaccine can continue to circulate for a long time. If this is allowed to occur, the vaccine-virus sometimes mutates into a form that can cause paralysis.
1.8.2.1.1. Con: This is only in very rare cases and when routine immunisation is poor. Since 2000 only [24 outbreaks](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/vaccines-are-they-safe-to-give-children-dangers-advice-facts-mmr-autism-donald-trump-anti-vaxxers-a7719491.html)of vaccine-derived polio were detected in 21 countries.
1.8.2.1.2. Con: This risk has been circumvented in the U.S. since about 1999, when we went to the injectible \(killed-virus, Salk\) polio vaccine. The oral \(live-virus, "sugar-cube", Sabin\) vaccine carried a tiny risk of the live virus mutating and being excreted in the feces of the vaccinated child, thereby infecting others. But the slight risk of the oral vaccine---in exchange for its slightly higher efficacy--- is still justified in the 3rd world, where the risk of wild-type polio is higher.[chop.edu](http://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/polio-vaccine)
1.8.2.2. Pro: In [rare cases](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/vaccines-are-they-safe-to-give-children-dangers-advice-facts-mmr-autism-donald-trump-anti-vaxxers-a7719491.html), vaccines can trigger a serious allergic reaction known as anaphylactic shock. This can develop quickly and is potentially life-threatening.
1.8.2.2.1. Con: This is only in very rare cases. The chances of contracting the disease the vaccine is preventing against is often much higher.
1.8.2.2.1.1. Pro: According to the [WHO](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/vaccines-are-they-safe-to-give-children-dangers-advice-facts-mmr-autism-donald-trump-anti-vaxxers-a7719491.html), the vaccine against human papillomavirus \(HPV\), given to girls to protect against cervical cancer, causes anaphylaxis in around two in a million cases.
1.8.2.2.2. Con: [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14523172) found a 0.65 in a million per-dosage rate of anaphylaxis from vaccines. This is less than my chances of getting hit by lightning this year \(1 in 700,000\)
1.8.2.3. Con: All medication and medical procedures have side effects. This is no reason to ignore the benefits derived from them.
1.8.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.3.1.
1.8.2.4. Pro: Citing reports of serious chronic pain and neurological symptoms, Japan [suspended](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/806645) its recommendation of the HPV vaccine for teenagers in 2013.
1.8.2.4.1. Con: The link between these symptoms and the HPV vaccine was [debunked](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/30/doctor-wins-2017-john-maddox-prize-countering-hpv-vaccine-misinformation-riko-muranaka) by a Kyoto University researcher.
1.8.2.4.2. Pro: [Lawsuits](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/02/13/national/crime-legal/suit-opens-tokyo-court-cervical-cancer-vaccine-side-effects/#.WpItIhPwY1g) have been brought against the Japanese state and pharmaceutical companies over Gardasil side affects.
1.8.2.5. Pro: The Trump administration has [floated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-to-meet-with-proponent-of-debunked-tie-between-vaccines-and-autism/2017/01/10/4a5d03c0-d752-11e6-9f9f-5cdb4b7f8dd7_story.html?utm_term=.0105c1848409) the idea of establishing a new commission on vaccine safety, indicating governmental concern about vaccine safety.
1.8.2.6. Pro: Death, which is a known side effect of vaccines, cannot be considered an acceptable risk, however rare. [www.dailymail.co.uk](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5937461/Samoa-halts-vaccines-MMR-two-babies-die-minutes-receiving-routine-shot.html)
1.8.3. Con: Even if this were true \(which there is no proof of\), not having vaccines harm children even more and more severely.
1.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.8.1.3.1.
1.8.3.2. Con: The [vaccine injury table](https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vaccine-compensation/vaccine-injury-table.pdf) is a document accepted by the US Federal government as stipulated fact. These are the harms known to be caused by specific vaccines.
1.8.4. Pro: As [this article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3263537/) shows, the influenza vaccine has a well documented list of possible neurological side effects.
1.8.4.1. Con: The most common significant neurologic side effect of the flu shot is Guillain-Barre, which is even [more common](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/169/3/382/86564) following natural influenza infection.
1.8.4.2. Con: This claim is weak, even according to its own citation. The cited article in fact recommends influenza vaccination. It clearly says the benefits far outweigh the risks.
1.8.4.3. Con: The study is a short report, and it reports a single "79-year-old man who developed an acute transient right oculomotor palsy two days after a routine influenza vaccination". The debate is about vaccinating children, not the elderly \(who have weakened immune systems anyway\).
1.8.5. Con: Vaccines are [tested](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/UCM298181.pdf) for safety.
1.8.5.1. Con: While this is true, not all vaccines are subjected to the same scientific rigor. The [flu vaccine](https://www.focusforhealth.org/seasonal-flu-shot-and-safety-testing/), for example, is approved annually via a much abbreviated process.
1.8.6. Pro: Vaccines [create a false sense of security](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21536816), leading people to behave in ways that are [more reckless](https://www.ishn.com/articles/83639-does-feeling-safe-make-us-more-reckless).
1.8.6.1. Con: Just because people are vaccinated against measles doesn't mean they will suddenly become reckless and seek out measles.
1.8.6.2. Pro: Prevention is not 100%. Having the vaccine does not ensure a person will not get sick any more than wearing a condom guarantees a person won't get pregnant or catch/pass on an STD.
1.8.6.2.1. Con: It does not matter that vaccines do not prevent infection 100% of the time because reduced possibility of infection by a large margin for a majority of the population is much better than no reduction.
1.8.6.2.2. Con: One of the main points of vaccination is to reduce the infection rate from one person to another so that rather than spreading exponentially the disease dies out. Taking measles, the [infection rate in an unvaccinated population is roughly 18.](https://watermark.silverchair.com/189-Supplement_1-S27.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAeMwggHfBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggHQMIIBzAIBADCCAcUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM84PYsrLBby8I1lv2AgEQgIIBltObPgd_SRaSVQDbaOzOAFQMfKPycc6IS4H858OiLk7ohmz7FWEyBF_B8BZHhGsZVoE50UwGUDpctdgepjEdOx2dtjKYcSZiXlti0TPYPx1GT_aQ5Z5P_qenoianInm3Nk_y5KvQUNDFMPShbz5zkbsnjy2VKCHpCZCq0RVdvGuu4AIxT5aSH0yK0rL8AhsNbJB0ZLIzWroBo-0wh2sNNnrNXrWXWf_qbrv3dja_Dx1eJDQSwKYg9kFrEjKCUI5GtapC1u8rNZmjd6CnqC14lBJGbdYuZCpBmK6R1x_SFmW3e4j5c_Tg1NqNdDRrL0oC11P0JVfQvNAucaow6e4DENlK1Bx5QElCEKoi7s7RuaWbky0m4pXbYqyXttJnjklZeUtzYeqQbxZKVq8cE8OQCa2lLxIhcX2U3jP6TZtPx7SktvknCR5k7u3OjC6RyAzVy_xXRnEH6A14Od0oMqpuhk-dH2UElBfvWTWatZ9zoYObfbB-X_ChdzWaERd3tbUyCsXV50obZaP9y3cvmNN1XF2kZhW2Wnw)Meaning one infected person infects 18 others on average before they are no longer contagious. If through vaccination the infection rate falls to 0.9, for every 10 infected people they will only pass it on to 9 people and it will die out rather than spread.
1.8.6.3. Con: The same public health advocates who recommend vaccination also recommend hand washing and staying home if you're sick.  You get all three messages if you get your flu shot at the pharmacy or a public health location \(school, health department\).
1.8.7. Con: Not all vaccines are the same, so to say all of them are dangerous is a false claim. Some have been dangerous and deadly. Some are benign and have prevented far worse diseases than any harmful side effects of the drugs within. It's necessary to do research about each illness and each vaccine to establish cost vs. benefit.
1.8.8. Con: There is a scientific consensus that vaccines do not cause [autism.](http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4026.pdf)
1.8.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.3.
1.8.8.2. Con: Even if we stipulate the truth of the parent claim, this does not exclude other harms.
1.8.8.2.1. Con: Great, I think the harm of the flu is probably worse, and has a *remarkable* 100% rate among people who experience the flu. I’ll take the unsubstantiated claim that I might get autism or some other random side-effect “discovered” from a case of someone in their late 70s over the [literal effects of the flu.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/consumer/symptoms.htm)
1.8.8.3. Con: False. There is a very large amount of peer-reviewed science refuting the claim that "vaccines do not cause autism". [\(studies\)](http://vaccinepapers.org/scientific-papers-library/) In the research cited supporting this claim, only one ingredient in one vaccine is discussed. Thimerosal in the MMR vaccine. This is not a basis for "consensus".
1.8.8.3.1. Con: The above link is to several studies of various mechanisms of inflammation, effects of adjuvants on mice and other animals and on markers of inflammation in humans. This body of data does not "refute" the claim that vaccines do not cause autism, In fact, [one of the studies](http://vaccinepapers.org/wp-content/uploads/Offit_addressing_parents_concerns.pdf) at the link above specifically states the adjuvants used in multiple vaccines have not been found to be harmful.
1.9. Pro: Not vaccinating children is a form of child-endangerment.
1.9.1. Con: Not every form of child endangerment is regulated/fined by the government.
1.9.1.1. Pro: Governments don't fine parents who let their children eat too many sweets, or who don't put sunscreen on the children in the summer
1.9.1.1.1. Con: These are individual behaviors that do not affect collectivity, therefore are not comparable with the risks of non-vaccinating children.
1.9.1.1.1.1. Con: This discussion is currently under "Child endangerment," which shouldn't require a collective argument. It's not OK for you to abuse or endanger your child just because it won't affect my child.
1.9.1.2. Con: It isn't possible for the government to regulate every form of child-endangerment.
1.9.2. Con: Essentially all parenting activities hold a risk of harm, so parents are not obligated to eliminate all risk.
1.9.2.1. Pro: Swimming pools, cars, sockets, dogs, ovens and all sort of other things that with enough creativity and little experience can do harm to you. All of them are dangerous to children to a certain degree. All of them kill some number of children every year, if we followed this position.
1.9.2.2. Con: "We can't fix everything so let's not try" is the Nirvana fallacy. If you can reduce significant harm without exorbitant cost you should.
1.9.2.3. Pro: Parents should observe a reasonable diligence, it could be argued extreme precautions and preventative measures can cause developmental and/or psychological neurosis issues in the child\(ren\) or into adulthood.
1.9.2.4. Con: Vaccination has an adequate academic consensus in the medical community, although no science claims certainty and leaves itself open to new information range from slight adjustments to paradigm change, until consensus does change there is no reason not to vaccinate.
1.9.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.
1.9.4. Con: -> See 1.8.
1.9.5. Pro: Parents should be investigated by CPS for not giving their child a vaccine.
1.9.5.1. Con: Sending CPS to a home frightens children and parents. This is direct harm while not vaccinating a child only creates the potential for harm.
1.9.5.1.1. Con: Not giving your child a vaccine can possibly kill them, sending CPS to their home will not.
1.9.5.2. Con: The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Bioethics has [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15867060?dopt=Abstract) against this "unless the child is put at significant risk of serious harm \(e.g., as might be the case during an epidemic\)."
1.9.6. Pro: By not vaccinating their children, parents impose an unnecessary risk to other children and people \(spreading a preventable disease\), in a similar fashion to smoking inside buildings, or driving drunk — and both activities have been prohibited by modern societies.
1.9.6.1. Con: They pose a risk to other children who haven't been vaccinated.
1.9.7. Pro: Vaccines don't just prevent potentially fatal diseases, they help protect vulnerable groups such as the very young, the very old and those whose immune systems are weak. Not vaccinating children poses a public health risk, and like any public health risk ie cockroaches in a restaurant then the owner gets fines, so should parents of children who fail to protect the public.
1.9.8. Con: A crime hasn't been committed until the child is injured.
1.9.8.1. Con: By definition, "child endangerment," which is against the law, means putting a child at RISK or injury. So the crime does not require that the child actually WAS injured.
1.9.9. Pro: Refusal to vaccinate a child against a disease for which a vaccine exists leaves that child open to a harm to them that could have been prevented.
1.9.9.1. Pro: Vaccination [reduces](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/six-myths-about-vaccination-and-why-theyre-wrong-13556) disease severity and duration of symptoms and complications.
1.9.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.7.1.
1.10. Con: We should not discourage people from voluntarily creating a massive control group for vaccine system efficiency at their own risk. Health statistics of this group of is a good benchmark of how efficient our vaccination system is. If there is no significant difference between incidence rates among two groups then maybe the entire vaccine system is not as beneficial as we thought.
1.10.1. Con: If that group is small then we can assume that they will have the same health outcomes as the vaccinated because of herd immunity.  If the group is large then we can assume that they'll break herd immunity for everyone making all health outcomes worse.
1.10.1.1. Con: This argument isn't logical, because herd immunity isn't an all-or-nothing thing. If 80% of the population is immune, then the chances are small\(but not zero\) that an epidemic will spread, and at worst it can only affect 20% of the population. If only 40% of the population is immune,then chances of epidemic are higher\(but not 100%\), but the disease can affect no more than 60% of the population. It's not correct that "everyone's" outcome will be worse.
1.10.1.2. Con: For measuring all outcomes, even a small un-vaccinated group can serve as a control, to observe the incidence of highly contagious diseases like measles, and to monitor the background level of alleged vaccine "side effects" such as autism.
1.10.1.3. Con: Try looking at this from another standpoint. There is a group of people that evaluated costs vs benefits of vaccination and made their bet to do it. There is a group of people that made same evaluation and made the opposite bet.  Survival is at stake.
My point is just let them see the who is right and who is wrong. If there will be a massive die off - it will make a good case for everyone else why it is important to be smart and make better evaluations.
1.10.1.4. Con: Pre-assumptions about complex systems are inherently a bad reason to limit freedom of choice.
1.10.2. Con: Encouraging some people not to vaccinate so that the natural disease process can be observed is unethical, given the body of evidence supporting vaccination. This would be analogous to the Tuskegee syphilis ["experiment."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment)
1.10.2.1. Con: The basic statement was not about encouraging not-vaccination. It was about not discouraging it. There is a difference between unethical experiment that is being constructed by health administration and unethical experiment that people voluntarily conduct  on their own. My point is just let them do it and gather the data. Either there will be a massive die off and we will have a compelling reason not to be stupid or we will have a reason to re-asses vaccination efficiency.
1.10.2.2. Con: The Tuskegee Syphilis experiment was conducted by the same people that bring us the vaccination paradigm, that gave manufacturers immunity from prosecution and grudgingly pay out millions in vaccine injury compensation every year. Trusting them is insane.
1.10.2.2.1. Con: Examples of mistakes and excesses in the past \(of individuals, governments and philosophies\) are not conclusive reasons to never trust them again. The US government has had stupid policies, and Angie's list is sometimes wrong, and not all of the films that win Academy Awards are any good. But we must press on with the best current evidence, which is not the same as blindly trusting.
1.10.3. Con: This would endanger children and adults who aren't able to be vaccinated for health reasons by reducing herd immunity.
1.10.4. Pro: People should be allowed to opt in to dangerous things.
1.10.4.1. Pro: We should let people not vaccinate because people will see the unvaccinated kids get sick and die, and then decide, on their volition, to vaccinate their kids, which is preferable to the government coercing them to.
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: Or they'll notice how much healthier they are than vaccinated children and other parents will wonder why their children aren't so healthy.
1.10.4.1.2. Con: Having to kill children to send a message sets a bad precedent for future regulations that could prevent the deaths of children by forcing parents to protect their kids.
1.10.4.2. Con: Parents owe their kids an upbringing, they put them here and are responsible for them. They should not be allowed to hurt or endanger them.
1.10.4.2.1. Pro: Parents who let their children be injured by vaccinations should be shunned by society.
1.10.5. Pro: The development of skillset needed for progression of knowledge and information filtering is inherently more valuable then short term gains from enforcing better choices.
1.10.5.1. Con: Except we already have the data around vaccine rates and efficiency, any further research is a redundancy and puts at risk people who have no choice in their own health due to illness. The formula can be found here: [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_efficacy)
1.10.6. Con: As the decision is taken by the parents, the control group would be composed of kids unable to refuse or even understand the health risks of the experiment.
1.10.6.1. Con: Parents are generally allowed to make decisions, and take risks, on behalf of their children, including taking the risks of vaccinating them. This means they are also allowed to take the risk of not vaccinating them
1.10.6.1.1. Con: When given the choice between more-risky option and a \(significantly\) less risky option, it seems ok to push parents towards the less risky option.
1.10.6.1.1.1. Con: In other words, if the majority of society believed in forced mastectomies to prevent cancer, all parents should subject their daughters to the procedure.
1.10.6.1.1.1.1. Con: Your "in other words" above, is not a fair paraphrase of the parent con. The phrase "significantly less-risky" opens a world of debate; for every example offered, we must weigh the comparative risks:risk of wild-type disease causing morbidity & mortality vs. risk of vaccine itself PLUS morbidity and mortality in the case of vaccine failure; risk of breast cancer in the general population vs. risk of mastectomy/ surgical complications/costs PLUS risk of cancer not prevented by mastectomy\)
1.10.6.1.2. Con: There are instances in which parents are not permitted to make decisions on behalf of their children if it has been determined that the child is at risk \(e.g. seat belt and booster seat laws\).
1.10.7. Con: This would not be a validly randomized study, as the patients are self-selected. Vaccine refusal may be associated with certain other religious/dietary/lifestyle beliefs and practices which may also affect disease incidence. Without controlling for those factors, this "control" group would not give reliable information about vaccine efficacy.
1.10.7.1. Con: At least it would be a control group. Vaccination science is based on assertions derived from a complete lack of a control group and the use of fraudulent placebos that contain the adjuvants used in the vaccines. Often, a new vaccine is only compared against existing vaccines instead of a placebo. [New Study Finds A “Wide Range of Devastating Risks” Associated With The HPV Vaccine](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2017/12/01/new-study-finds-a-wide-range-of-devasting-risks-associated-with-the-hpv-vaccine/)
1.10.8. Con: Since vaccines are only at their most potent if the entire population takes part in them this would create skewed results.
1.10.9. Con: We have the data already and we know that vaccine rates above 95% are the sweet spot, this isn't new research, this isn't unknown territory, this is solid, evidence based knowledge that saves lives. Any child who is not vaccinated for reasons other than legitimate medical reasons is a child that puts their friends, class/day care mates at risk. A great guide to herd immunity can be found here: [vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk](http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/herd-immunity)
1.10.9.1. Con: This is unproven guessing. To prove this "hypothesis" you need a control group, independent researchers, and true placebos none of which ever apply to vaccine science.
1.10.10. Con: Children of the recommended vaccination age cannot make their own decisions, objectively understand them and the risks of disease nor are they capable of communicating their preference about them.

When parents aren't vaccinating children, those children aren't voluntarily creating a control group, they are being forced into one and involuntary exposed to all the risks that come with this.
1.11. Con: This is an obvious violation of privacy and bodily autonomy. Having the government regulate what goes into your body, or your child's body is not a power the government should have.
1.11.1. Pro: The 4th Amendment upholds an individual's right to privacy. That is, to feel secure in and have autonomy over their own body.
1.11.2. Con: Many countries do not grant such constitutional protection.
1.11.3. Con: The role of the government is to serve and protect its people. If a parent preventing their child from getting a vaccination is resulting in harm coming to the child then it is reasonable for them to provide legislation, in harmony with the 4th amendment, that would protect these children.
1.11.3.1. Con: Injecting a vaccination into someones body against their will is diametrically opposed to the protections afforded by the constitution. There is a possibility of harm to a child, not foreseeable or actionable given our governing documents.
1.11.4. Con: Governments already mandate vaccines to receive services such as public schooling, so precedent allows this requirement.
1.11.4.1. Con: Restriction of access to a place is not an analog for mandating something be put into you or your child's body. Airports do not violate the second amendment, but do not allow guns in the airport.
1.11.5. Con: This policy impacts the 4th Amendment rights of parents as little as possible while achieving the public health goals of the government.
1.11.5.1. Pro: Public health is a compelling state interest and this policy uses the least restrictive means to achieve it.
1.11.6. Pro: Informed consent is a choice made, weighing risks versus benefits. To impose a fine is to introduce coercion into the decision making process. This diminishes the ability to consent.
1.11.7. Pro: Parents should have freedom of choice about what to put in their children.
1.11.7.1. Con: A child's right to health is more important than a parents right to choose.
1.11.7.1.1. Con: The risks and benefits of vaccination will vary from one child to another.
1.11.7.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.11.7.1.2. Pro: Health is prerequisite to other rights.
1.11.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.2.
1.11.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.5.1.
1.11.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.11.6.
1.11.7.5. Pro: The [Tuskegee Syphilis Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment) and other historical incidents have created a deep distrust between African-American families and the government. To fine these parents for not wanting to have the government vaccinate their children recalls that history of discrimination and is coercive.
1.11.7.6. Con: We restrict the freedom of parents all the time when they make decisions which we know will be bad for their kids.
1.11.7.6.1. Pro: Children are required to be educated because we agree that education is good for the child and an educated populace is a good thing generally.
1.11.7.6.2. Pro: Children are not allowed to drink or smoke until a certain age, regardless of whether their parents personally agree with it or not, because to do so would be bad for their health.
1.11.7.6.3. Con: -> See 1.8.
1.11.7.6.4. Pro: The State will take children away from their biological parents if they are abusive or overly neglectful.
1.11.7.7. Con: Parents are by far, the predominant type of abuser in child abuse cases. Their right to represent their child is not absolute.
1.11.7.7.1. Pro: The [Munchausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factitious_disorder_imposed_on_another) by proxy syndrome is an example of why parents rights in regards to their child should be limited.
1.11.7.7.2. Con: The individual parent's rights to make decisions on behalf of their child should not be limited due to the existence of previous cases of other children being abused.
1.11.8. Pro: Informed consent is the basis of our tradition of medical ethics.  Eroding that would lead to more abuses.  Just like sex without consent is considered to be rape, poking someone with a needle without consent is assault and battery.  Waiving that away for the public good strikes me as a tradeoff that does far more harm than good.
1.11.8.1. Con: Fining people does not take away their right to consent or refuse vaccination.
1.11.8.1.1. Con: Fining people does not take away their right to consent but it does criminalise them for exercising their right to informed consent.
1.11.8.1.1.1. Con: If there are people who can't be vaccinated, those who can have to vaccinate themselves: we aren't talking about "exercising the right to informed consent", we are talking about the right to life for children who can't be vaccinated.
1.11.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.11.8.1.1.
1.11.9. Con: -> See 1.11.8.1.
1.11.10. Pro: Providing access to medical records, in order to fine people, or asking schools to report on people would have ramifications for broader trust of families in vital public services.
1.11.10.1. Con: There is precedent and wide acceptance of this model already. Doctors routinely report on immunization status to the schools. This requires parental consent to release the records, but kids can be restricted from school if this consent is withheld. Presumably a fine would be levied if immunization records were not complete according to a government compliance office, so parents would have to consent to release records, or pay a fine.
1.11.11. Pro: We can surmise most refusals to vaccinate are based on parents merely testing their authority against the state, community, scientific/medical consensus. People have a certain neurosis about feeling in control despite its illusory nature.
1.11.11.1. Con: This assertion is groundless. Most antivaxxers seem to be parents who finally realised why their child died or was permanently injured after a vaccination but many others are people who believe in natural health and the body's ability to maintain health given a healthy lifestyle.
1.11.12. Con: Parents not vaccinating their children directly harms the children and society as a whole.
1.11.13. Con: The government has a well established legal right to regulate practices that can cause harm congruent with fourth amendment protections.
1.11.13.1. Con: There is no imminent danger to self or others associated with not being vaccinated. There is only a possibility of contracting, and a secondary possibility of spreading, an illness. None of this meets any criteria to violate the protections afforded by the fourth amendment.
1.11.13.2. Pro: All rights have limits. If one person's actions make others ill or even kill them then we ought to regulate those actions.
1.11.13.3. Pro: When a right can be abused to impinge on others rights then they cease to be absolute and need to be balanced with others rights. 
In this case very young children who are too young to safely vaccinate would be harmed if exposed to a communicable disease dormant in somebody who would not be bringing it to this small child had they been vaccinated.
Very young children's right to life \(or at least freedom from harm\) needs to be tempered against other's rights.
1.12. Con: Many vaccines are "for profit" - this would just be another regulation to ensure certain companies stay in business and make good profits.
1.12.1. Con: Many companies profit by manufacturing seat belts and fire extinguishers. The fact that someone will profit\(and will simultaneously risk future losses, by positioning his/her company to take advantage of regulations which are subject to change\) should not dissuade us from mandating sensible vaccine policy.
1.12.2. Con: This only means two groups benefit, saying something is ''for profit'' does not mean it is in and of itself negative.
1.13. Pro: Vaccines are an easy and cheap practice and have a great therapeutic index. Refusing this practice and letting the children get a vaccine preventable illness with the potential need of hospitalization is an usless overcharge of the hospital service, and thus should be fined
1.14. Con: It is a very dangerous concept that parents should be fined if they don’t have their children vaccinated. We don’t currently fine sportswomen who play rugby who might get a head injury or a broken bone; nor do we fine women who have more than one lifetime sexual partner because they are at higher risk of cervical cancer. I would much prefer to educate the population and achieve herd immunity than punish those not convinced.
1.14.1. Con: The above examples are of people taking risks on their own behalf. Parents who do not vaccinate are taking a risk on behalf of their children, and are increasing the risk of infection among innocent bystanders.
1.14.2. Con: We do [fine people](https://www.health24.com/Lifestyle/Stop-smoking/Prevalance-in-sa/10-smoking-laws-you-must-know-20120721) who expose others to risks, as with public smoking.
1.15. Con: This would be unfair and cruel punishment. Especially considering science has found childhood infections to be an important part of development. \([Studies](http://vaxinfostarthere.com/childhood-infectious-diseases-protect-us-cancers-later-life/?fbclid=IwAR277pjw-WxWRlmxuJl77lgq4gT55_dE1Tn9oSlg7Mbt9lBO26VU7XAUM78)\)
1.15.1. Con: Vaccines have eradicated many diseases with high mortality rates. Even if childhood exposure to diseases assisted in cancer prevention in the long run \(which the evidence for is lacking\), the risk of the child dying of the preventable disease is much too high to be worth it. Especially based on the off chance it might, if they survive, prevent them from developing cancer which they might not have developed or die from anyway.
1.16. Con: People who are vaccinated transmit the disease, against which they are vaccinated, to fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Measles is a documented example of a disease spread by vaccinated people. [www.greenmedinfo.com](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/measles-transmitted-vaccinated-gov-researchers-confirm)
1.17. Con: Governments should respect everyone's position.
1.17.1. Con: Opinions are not objectively equals. If a position is ignorant and dangerous for themselves and others, it does not have to be respected.
1.17.1.1. Con: A person's personal weighing of risks and benefits cannot be disregarded as the result of such weighing is always subjective. There is no objective correct answer, only an individual's choice.
1.17.1.1.1. Con: To the contrary: Sometimes there is a "correct" answer. Gravity exists. The earth is round. Vaccines either do, or do not, prevent disease. They either do, or do not, cause autism. People are allowed to deny that gravity exists, but this discussion is about whether the government, in the light of the evidence, should allow some people to jump off of cliffs\[or to throw their children off\]
1.17.2. Con: A government may respect an individual’s beliefs. But that does not compel said government to allow that belief to harm another individual. For example a Jehovah’s Witness may refuse a transfusion. But they may not allow their child to die over this belief.
1.17.3. Con: It is impossible to respect everyone's position. Instead, the government must respect the best overall policy.
1.17.4. Pro: We should seek to inform families not punish them for disagreement.
1.17.5. Con: If the choice to not vaccinate only affected the person in question then it would be correct for the Government to respect that decision, however the choice not to vaccinate puts others in danger and therefore should no longer be a personal choice.
1.17.5.1. Con: -> See 1.7.3.1.1.
1.17.5.2. Con: -> See 1.7.3.1.2.
1.17.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.7.8.
1.17.6. Con: The government should respect everyone's position with certain leeway. Not vaccinating your kids goes beyond that leeway as it harms children
