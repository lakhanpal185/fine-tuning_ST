Discussion Title: Is Hamlet Mad?

1. Hamlet Is Mad.
1.1. Con: It depends entirely on the production and context.
1.1.1. Con: Hamlet should be interpreted based on what is written in the original text.
1.1.1.1. Con: Shakespeare wrote Hamlet to be performed, not read. Interpreting based solely on the text means losing many essential aspects of the play.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: The manner and tone of Hamlet's words have a large influence on how outlandish or mad his behaviour appears. Since Shakespeare did not exactly specify how this aspect of the character should be performed, actors and directors must make decisions about how they want Hamlet to come across.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Other characters' descriptions and responses to Hamlet make it clear that Hamlet is acting in a mad manner. Their text would not make sense if an actor performed Hamlet in a sane manner.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: While in a conversation with Hamlet, Polonius says as an aside to the audience "He is far gone, far gone" and then later in the conversation again to the audience "How pregnant sometimes his replies are. A happiness that often madness hits on." \(Act 2, SC 2\)
1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: During her conversation with Hamlet Ophelia states "Oh, help him, sweet heavens!" and "Heavenly powers, restore him!" in response to what he is saying to her. She would have no reason to call to the heavens instead of responding to him if he were not acting in a mad manner. \(Act 3, SC 1\)
1.1.1.2. Pro: Many interpretations add new elements to Hamlet and discard what is written in the text. Doing so means that we are no longer interpreting Shakespeare's Hamlet, but a new and distinct piece of art.
1.1.1.2.1. Con: Interpretations do not affect the original script. Many artists take inspiration and alter existing art, that does not mean that these new interpretations have any bearing on the original artwork.
1.1.1.2.2. Con: Taking Shakespeare's voice away from Hamlet simply because there have been other interpretations created is disrespectful to the art of writing. If someone drew a newly interpreted version of the Mona Lisa it may be an interesting take and art in its own right, but it would not change the original Mona Lisa and how it is viewed.
1.1.1.2.2.1. Con: No author/ artist can guarantee that their piece of art will be viewed and interpreted in the way they intended. Every artist must accept the limitations of their ability to transmit a message and the role the viewer themselves plays in shaping their engagement with a piece of art.
1.1.1.2.3. Pro: The reframing of Hamlet in places like \(famously\) [The Lion King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King)- along with directly inspiring a [huge variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_in_popular_culture) of film, TV, literature and music - indicates how Hamlet, as a work, has taken on its own cultural significance outside the precise constraints of the original text.
1.1.1.3. Con: The 'original text' is not sacrosanct. There are differences between versions \(Folio/Quartos\), and arguments as to which is the 'original' version are many and impossible to truly determine.
1.1.1.3.1. Pro: In Act 2, Scene ii, the speech opening with "Oh what a rogue and peasant slave am I?" - known best in the Folio version - is seen in the First Quarto as opening with "Why what a dunghill idiote slave am I?", and proceeds very differently, with several lines omitted.
1.1.1.3.2. Pro: Even one of the most famous soliloquies in the Shakespearean canon - '[To be or not to be](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_be,_or_not_to_be)' - has three very different incarnations, across the Quartos and Folio.
1.1.1.3.3. Pro: The different [Folio and Quarto versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_texts_of_Shakespeare%27s_works) of Shakespeare's plays were published at different points over several decades; consistency and accuracy of transcription are unlikely.
1.1.2. Pro: Different productions of Shakespeare often emphasise different aspects of characters in order to create a unique dramatic experience and encourage audiences to look at old stories in new and refreshing ways.
1.1.2.1. Pro: Director [Thomas Ostermeier](https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/theatre-arts/what-a-piece-of-work-is-a-totally-mad-man-in-hamlet-30619738.html)'s adaption of Hamlet emphasises the central character's madness to create a version of the play which is humorous, powerful and chilling in altogether different ways than the original.
1.1.2.2. Pro: [Ian Rickson's Hamlet](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/8881752/Michael-Sheens-controversial-Hamlet-merely-proves-the-plays-innate-worth.html) had the entire play set in a mental institution, to pressure the idea of his madness, and indeed that of the surrounding characters.
1.1.3. Pro: The cultural and political understanding brought to the play by an audience has a large influence on whether or not they would consider Hamlet mad.
1.1.3.1. Pro: Hamlet's behaviour towards Ophelia may have been viewed by Elizabethan audiences as humorous and forgivable products of his ruse. Modern audiences may see his behaviour as unacceptable sexual and emotional abuse and may conclude that he is genuinely mad as a result.
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: Ophelia would have been played by a young boy during Elizabethan times, this may have made her interactions with Hamlet more humorous for Elizabethan audiences in comparison to modern audiences where she is portrayed by a more mature woman.
1.1.3.2. Pro: A culture or social setting where madness is misunderstood or mistrusted would read Hamlet's madness very differently, and potentially find it more frightening or dangerous.
1.2. Con: Hamlet proceeds throughout the play in order to exact his revenge in a method that is collected and building up towards a goal. A mad person would not have been able to accomplish a life goal, especially a hard one such as regicide.
1.2.1. Con: Hamlet simply succeeds in a murder. Many people convicted of violent crimes have [mental health issues](https://www.google.ie/amp/s/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/67295/) this shows that it is possible to succeed in a murder plot while "mad".
1.2.2. Pro: Through the play he proves to himself beyond reasonable doubt that Claudius did kill his father before proceeding with his plan to murder him. This action demonstrates a clarity of mind rather than impulsive violence more consistent with madness.
1.2.2.1. Pro: The entirety of the play \(Act 3, scene ii\) is a deliberate and well thought of act by Hamlet. Since he has no other way of verifying that his father has been murdered, he seeks to judge his uncle's reaction to determine guilt.
1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Not only does Hamlet rely upon his own perception but also relies upon Horatio to weigh in \(Act 3 scene 3\) and give a second opinion. A mad individual presumably is too disconnected from reality to care about what others around him think.
1.2.2.2. Con: Despite this, it never occurs to him to pursue a more legitimate line of vengeance: murder is the only option that he's prepared to pursue.
1.2.2.2.1. Con: In Elizabethan times, it would have been clear to the audience that killing Claudius was the only option available to Hamlet \([Para 9 and 10](http://www.field-of-themes.com/shakespeare/essays/Ehamlet2.htm)\). Claudius was King, so there were no higher authorities Hamlet could have used to hold Claudius accountable for his crime.
1.2.3. Con: Hamlet [procrastinates](https://www.bachelorandmaster.com/globaldrama/procrastination-in-avenging-the-murder-of-father-in-hamlet.html#.WuRch6XTU0M) throughout the play and broods consistently on his task. He does not demonstrate clarity of thought or collected actions at all despite ultimately completing his goal.
1.2.3.1. Con: Hamlet's procrastination is not an indication of madness. A mad individual would commit murder without caring about the consequences.
1.2.3.1.1. Pro: Madness entails a certain degree of disconnection from reality. If a mad person wanted to murder someone, they would hardly care about the consequences of their actions or the legitimacy of their allegations since they're disconnected from the reality around them.
1.2.3.1.2. Con: Hamlet does commit a murder without caring without the consequences. By the end of the play he had caused the death of a number of people.
1.2.3.1.2.1. Pro: The murder itself - Hamlet crying "A rat!" and stabbing instantly, without checking who it was nor their reason for being there - shows a complete lack of thought or reasoning. There is nothing in the text to suggest a shred of remorse over the act, either, in the lines immediately following the murder.
1.2.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.1.
1.2.3.1.2.2. Pro: Hamlet contemplates murder throughout the play eventually murdering multiple characters with seemingly no regret.
1.2.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Political [assassination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination) has been a common tactic throughout history, especially in the [Elizabethan](https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-363688399/license-to-kill-assassination-and-the-politics-of) era. Given that the murder of Claudius is both in Hamlet's interest and a common feature of the politics of Elsinore, it is hardly a sign of madness for him to consider it.
1.2.3.1.2.2.2. Pro: After Hamlet mistakes Polonius for Claudius and kills him, his words show no remorse for his actions: "Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell. I took thee for thy better." \(Act 3, scene iv\)
1.2.4. Pro: Hamlet is exploring alternative ways of processing reality and reaching his goals, which are not necessarily mad, but which appear mad. The method to his "madness" may be unethical but that is a different discussion. He creates chaos and tension to establish desired outcomes by allowing for arational insights and impulses to feed his narrative and more premeditated structural vision.
1.2.5. Pro: Hamlet is far too on top of things to be mad. Hamletâ€™s intellectual brilliance is first brought out in Act I, scene V when he plans on acting mad to confuse his enemies. His insults at Claudius and Polonius in Act II and Act V Sc. III are rooted from deep intellectual thought rather than erraticism, showing that the feigned madness runs through the play's entirety.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Hamlet's "mad comments" \(especially in the context of his encounters with Polonius\) seem to be making thinly veiled criticisms of others, often in a witty manner, which would be highly unusual if he really were mad.
1.2.5.1.1. Pro: Hamlet calls Polonius a "fishmonger" \(Act 2, scene ii\). This was [Elizabethan slang](https://mymarginalia.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/william-shakespeare-and-the-gentle-art-of-cursing/) for a pimp. In this light, Hamlet's comments can be read as a cutting condemnation of Polonius' treatment of Ophelia, using her as a tool to get information about Hamlet.
1.2.5.2. Con: Depressed individuals are equally capable of reflecting on universal existential, philosophical and emotional questions. Many [famous philosophers](https://www.brainz.org/10-philosophers-who-were-mentally-disturbed/) suffered from mental illnesses throughout their lives. Claiming that Hamlet had a mental illness does not change the text and so does not make it any less intellectual.
1.3. Con: Hamlet states throughout the play that his madness is a ruse.
1.3.1. Pro: Hamlet openly admits he is putting 'an antic disposition on' to fool those around him. \(Act 1, Scene i\)
1.3.2. Pro: Hamlet is based on older [Scandinavian tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sources_of_Hamlet). In these older versions of the story, Hamlet's madness is explicitly a ruse designed to protect him from his uncle.
1.3.2.1. Con: Shakespeare regularly changes details from his source material in order to introduce complexity and ambiguity into the story. Hamlet's madness is no different.
1.3.3. Pro: In the latter portent of the play, Hamlet assures his mother that "I essentially am not in madness / but mad in craft," making it certain that he is faking any madness. \(Act 3, Scene iv\)
1.3.3.1. Con: It is perfectly possible that Hamlet is either delusional or lying with regards to his sanity. This is especially likely because in this scene Hamlet is attempting to convince his mother to take his side. This would not have been aided by his mother thinking he was losing his grip on reality.
1.3.3.2. Con: In this very scene, the best evidence for Hamlet's progressively worsening insanity is presented. After Hamlet sees the ghost, Gertrude doubts its presence, saying she says "nothing at all." \(Act 3, Scene iv\)
1.3.4. Con: Hamlet is an unreliable source with regards to his own sanity. If he is mad, then he may not himself be fully aware of it.
1.4. Pro: Hamlet shows a variety of symptoms that today would be diagnosed as mental illness.
1.4.1. Con: Many people in the world exhibit possible symptoms of mental illness. That does not qualify them as being mad and being cut off from reality.
1.4.2. Con: These symptoms may not have been viewed by society at the time and the author as mental illness, the way we think of mental illness today. Hamlet's behaviour could have been perceived and thought of as more reflecting of his character than of a temporary state of mental illness.
1.4.2.1. Con: Despite the lack of knowledge at that time Shakespeare was especially adapt at portraying the human psyche as it naturally occurred. Therefore as mental illnesses did not only appear with our understanding of them, the symptoms Hamlet portrays are still symptoms of a mental illness even if Shakespeare himself did not have the vocabulary to understand it. \([pp.6,7](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1276&context=cc_etds_theses)\)
1.4.2.2. Con: Melancholy was understood to, at the time the play was written, run in extremes between violence and unshakable sadness. This describes Hamlet's behaviour well, demonstrating that even according to Elizabethan society Hamlet's symptoms showed mental illness. \([pp.76,79](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1276&context=cc_etds_theses)\)
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Elizabethan society believed that people suffering from melancholy were susceptible to demonic influences often disguised as spirits. Hamlet's need to prove the ghost's tale demonstrates that he himself may believe that he is suffering from melancholy. \([pp.79](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1276&context=cc_etds_theses)\)
1.4.2.2.2. Pro: Hamlet complains of "bad dreams" in Act 2 SC 2, which was a symptom of melancholy \(line 275\).
1.4.2.2.3. Pro: In Act 2 Scene ii, Hamlet greets his friends Guildenstern and Rosencrantz by saying "What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison hither?" The feeling of being in prison was a recognized symptom of melancholy \(The Arden Shakespeare, ed Harold Jenkins, footnote p. 250\).
1.4.2.3. Pro: An irregular pulse was considered a symptom of madness in Elizabethan times. When Hamlet demonstrated a steady pulse to Gertrude that would have been proof to an Elizabethan audience that he was sane. \([pp.89](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1276&context=cc_etds_theses)\)
1.4.3. Con: It is a matter of perception what we often call madness; the impact of the play is in it unveiling a series of scenes connecting madness and rationality. One can find the correlation in most scenes but it's the passion and desperate isolation one feels that leads to that personal vicious cycle of inclusion, repelling and starving for deliberation through revenge. Madness is Hamlet's own way of expressing the purity of one's mind in an unaware strict society.
1.4.4. Con: Hamlet is both mad and not mad, in turns.  Modern understanding of mental illnesses allows for a more nuanced continuum than simply "mad" or "not mad".  States of mind change in different situations and from reactions to events.
1.4.5. Pro: Hamlet's state at the beginning of the play is one of [extreme depression](http://www.psnpaloalto.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Depression-Diagnostic-Criteria-and-Severity-Rating.pdf): it is externally validated, with self-reported lack of interest or pleasure in activities and thoughts of suicide.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Hamlet complains of having "lost all mirth", and having lost his appetite for any activity \(Act 2 SC 2, line 315 ff\).
1.4.5.2. Pro: Hamlet suffers from depression and grief, not madness. He is overwhelmed by a painful first experience with death. He continues to be able to rationally measure his desires and actions against his moral belief system \(he is trying to understand a world ruled by a benevolent God that has such suffering and cruelty\).
1.4.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.2.
1.4.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.3.
1.4.6. Pro: There is an argument to strongly suggestion that Hamlet shows classical signs of [clinical schizophrenia](https://diagnosinghamlet.weebly.com/hamlet.html).
1.4.6.1. Pro: Hamlet has hallucinations, the most undisputed one being of his father's ghost in his mother's bed chambers. Hallucinations are a common symptom of schizophrenia.
1.4.6.1.1. Con: The ghost is initially witnessed by Marcellus and Bernardo, then later by Horatio and, finally, Hamlet. This lends credence to it being real, rather than a hallucination on Hamlet's part.
1.4.6.1.1.1. Con: Seen, but not spoken to; even if the ghost is visible, the auditory element is Hamlet's alone.
1.4.6.1.2. Pro: The appearance of the ghost during the 'bedchamber scene' with Gertrude \(Act 3, Scene iv\) indicates that it is exclusively Hamlet's hallucination, as Gertrude cannot see it.
1.4.6.1.2.1. Con: The only person who does not see the ghost when it is in fact present is Gertrude - every other time that the ghost shows up, it is seen by the people around it.
1.4.6.1.2.1.1. Pro: Gertrude might not have seen the ghost in the bedchamber because she was already in a terrible state of mind. She had just witnessed the murder of Polonius and would not have been able to comprehend the ghost of her dead husband, whose legacy she had been betraying.
1.4.6.1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.1.1.
1.4.6.1.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.1.1.
1.4.6.2. Pro: He displays disorganised speech, a symptom of schizophrenia, throughout the play. He very often speaks in nonsensical sentences which no-one else can understand.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.4.6.2.2. Pro: Hamlet's bemusing speech to Rosencrantz and Guidenstern, including the confusing "The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King is a thing..." feels oddly childish and sing-song, suggesting madness.
1.4.7. Pro: Hamlet demonstrates several hallmarks of [psychosis](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/psychosis/), primarily delusions \(that he is the only person able to uncover his uncle's betrayal\) and hallucinations \(of his father's ghost\).
1.4.7.1. Pro: Indeed, further signs include depression, anxiety, withdrawal from family and friends, disorganised speech, and suspiciousness - all of which Hamlet show in abundance.
1.4.7.2. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.1.
1.4.8. Pro: Hamlet shows [suicidal ideation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation) on more than one occasion: "... that the Everlasting had not fixed / His cannon â€™gainst self-slaughter" \(Act 1, Scene ii\), and, of course, the famous "To be or not to be" speech \(Act 3, Scene i\).
1.5. Pro: A number of characters in the play are led to believe, and report, that Hamlet is mad.
1.5.1. Con: Horatio, the character Hamlet confides in most out of anyone in the play, does not seem to believe that Hamlet is mad. He agrees to Hamlet's request for him to stay alive in order to set the record straight and in his summary of the tragedy to Fortinbras speaks of deceit and murder but does not mention madness. \(Act 2, Sc 5\)
1.5.2. Pro: Ophelia also reports his erratic behaviour, evidenced further in how he goes from adoring love to seeming repulsion of a relationship with her.
1.5.2.1. Con: It is quite [common](https://www.elitedaily.com/dating/sudden-repulsion-syndrome/1574959) for someone in a relationship to suddenly change their mind about their partner. Hamlet was harsh in his rejection, however his lack of romantic interest in Ophelia is not a reason to assume madness.
1.5.2.1.1. Con: The extremity of the shift is unusual; from being not a long distance from marriage, to Hamlet's "get thee to a nunnery", is a rather shocking change for Ophelia. It is not unreasonable that she questions his mental health.
1.5.3. Pro: Polonius outright states "Your noble son is mad" to Gertrude and Claudius after witnessing his behaviour. \(Act 2, Scene ii\)
1.5.3.1. Pro: In Act 2 Scene ii, Polonius tells the Queen that Hamlet's love for Ophelia has driven him mad and hands Gertrude a love letter as evidence \(line 116\).
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: Shakespeare often used the trope of mad love, for example stating in 'As You Like It' \(Act 3 Scene ii\) that "Love is merely a madness".
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Rejected or unsatisfied lovers were [thought](https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeare-and-madness) to be at risk of mental collapse.
1.5.3.1.2.1. Pro: Ophelia goes mad later in the play, when Hamlet rejects her.
1.5.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Ophelia's madness is born almost exclusively out of grief for her father's death.
1.5.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: When analysing the songs she sings in her madness she sings both of death and a lover's rejection. This seems to indicate that both Hamlet's abusive treatment of Ophelia and her fathers death were responsible for her descent into madness. \(Act 4, Sc 5\)
1.5.3.1.3. Con: Shakespeare and his contemporaries were [aware](https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/shakespeare-and-madness) that infatuation could be readily confused with madness.
1.5.3.1.3.1. Pro: He had Theseus explain this in A Midsummer Night's Dream: "Lovers and madmen have such seething brains/ Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend/  More than cool reason ever comprehends./ The lunatic, the lover and the poet/ Are of imagination all compact." This would suggest that Hamlet's mad behaviour could also have been the result of loving too passionately.
1.5.3.2. Con: Polonius himself is unsure of the nature of Hamlet's madness, stating in the same scene: "Though this be madness, yet there is method in't." \(Act 2, Scene ii\)
1.5.3.3. Con: Polonius is represented as [foolish](https://schoolworkhelper.net/polonius-a-fool-in-shakespeares-hamlet/) throughout the play. He could very well be wrong in his assertion that Hamlet is mad.
1.5.4. Con: Throughout the play, Claudius indicates that he does not fully believe that Hamlet is mad.
1.5.4.1. Pro: Claudius instructs his henchmen "Get from him why he puts on this confusion" \(Act 2, scene i\). This indicates that Claudius not only believes that Hamlet is faking his madness, but that he has a motivation for doing so.
1.5.4.2. Pro: Claudius admits that Hamlet's behaviour is more indicative of depression or melancholy than madness "What he spake, though it lack'd form a little. Was not like madness." \(Act 3, Scene i\)
1.5.5. Con: The fact that other characters believe and report Hamlet's madness shows us that his plan has worked, not that he is mad.
1.5.6. Con: None of these characters have any qualifications or background which would give weight to their beliefs. Therefore their opinions do not mean much.
1.5.6.1. Con: Qualifications in such areas simply didn't exist in this period; the earliest 'psychologists' emerged in [the 1870s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_psychology).
1.5.6.2. Pro: Doctors in the Elizabethan Era studied human mentality. While they did not understand the human psyche as we do today, engaging in the concept of humoralism \([pp.4](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1276&context=cc_etds_theses)\) which was later disproven, anyone who had some background in caring for the ill would have been preferable in diagnosing Hamlet than the nobility of Denmark.
1.5.6.3. Con: Gertrude \(and arguably Ophelia\) do have the background: they have grown up with Hamlet, know his behaviour, and so would be perfectly placed to notice and comment upon any changes in that behaviour - as they do.
1.6. Pro: The 'ghost' which Hamlet sees at the outset of the play \(Act 1, Scene v\) is a hallucination, which only speaks and interacts fully with him when there is nobody else present to confirm if it is real.
1.6.1. Con: In [Elizabethan times](https://delshakeshamlet.weebly.com/ghosts-in-elizabethan-england.html), when Hamlet was written, ghosts were more commonly believed in and so would not have been considered a hallucination by the audience.
1.6.1.1. Pro: Both Catholic and Protestant religions, the common religions at that time,[accepted](https://delshakeshamlet.weebly.com/ghosts-in-elizabethan-england.html) the presence of ghosts. The Catholic religion even specifically preached that souls in purgatory would have to work off their sins until they could reach Heaven. This concept is in line with the ghost's actions throughout the play.
1.6.1.2. Pro: Elizabethan audiences would have been particularly ready to believe that supernatural occurrences would be more likely in the wake of deeds which challenged or upended the natural order of things, such as the murder of King Hamlet. The unnatural state of Elsinore is emphasised throughout the first act: "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark" \(Act 1, Scene v\).
1.6.1.2.1. Pro: The play is underpinned by the war between Denmark and Norway; political upheaval is everywhere, Denmark itself threatened with collapse.
1.6.2. Con: The presence of the ghost may simply be a literary tool to help the audience understand Hamlet's motivations better. Since audience members would view the apparition moving around the stage, they would be more compelled to understand's Hamlet's motivations.
1.6.3. Pro: The fact that Hamlet continues to procrastinate his revenge against Claudius even after the appearance of the ghost indicates that Hamlet himself is unsure whether or not the ghost is real.
1.6.3.1. Con: Hamlet's stated reasoning for not trusting the ghost does not indicate that he is distrustful of his own madness, but rather a striking lucidity in the face of the supernatural: "The spirit that I have seen/ May be a devil, and the devil hath power/ Tâ€™assume a pleasing shape" \(Act 2, Scene ii\).
1.6.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.2.1.
1.6.4. Pro: The ghost tells Hamlet what he expects to hear: that his uncle is responsible for his father's death - evidenced in Hamlet's "Oh, my prophetic soul!" \(Act 1, Scene v\).
1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.1.2.
1.6.6. Con: The ghost's message contains facts that nobody else could have known.
1.6.6.1. Pro: Claudius' soliloquy \(Act 3, scene iii\) confirms that Claudius did in fact kill old Hamlet: "O, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven".
1.6.6.2. Con: Claudius had motive, opportunity and means to kill Old Hamlet. Hamlet, an astute individual, had noted this. Therefore, it is likely that Hamlet's correct suspicion that Claudius was to blame for his father's death manifested itself in a hallucination of a ghost. The fact that this hallucination was correct indicates Hamlet's intelligence and luck, not that the ghost is real.
1.6.6.2.1. Pro: Strategic [political assassination](https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-363688399/license-to-kill-assassination-and-the-politics-of) was far from uncommon in Elizabethan times. It is perfectly reasonable that Hamlet would suspect Claudius especially considering that he subsequently rose to the throne and married his mother.
1.6.6.2.2. Pro: Hamlet's resentment towards Claudius goes beyond what would is typical or considered appropriate given the situation if he did not suspect further corruption before he meets the ghost: "So excellent a king, that was to this / Hyperion to a satyr" \(Act 1, scene ii\).
1.6.6.2.3. Pro: Even when Claudius confesses to killing Old Hamlet  \(Act 3, scene iii\),  he never mentions anything about poisoning Old Hamlet. This indicates that while the gist of Hamlet's suspicions may have been correct, elements of the ghost's narrative are constructions of Hamlet's imagination.
1.6.6.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.4.
1.6.6.3. Pro: Claudius reacted strongly to Hamlet's play depicting the story, thereby proving that the ghost's tale was accurate.
1.6.6.3.1. Con: This reaction could be attributed to Claudius' attempts to act sorrowful at the King's death, proving his [manipulative](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/150/the-manipulative-nature-of-claudius-in-shakespeares-hamlet) nature rather than proving accuracy on the part of the ghost.
1.6.6.4. Pro: Claudius and Hamlet's father were the only people present during the murder. As it is unlikely Claudius told Hamlet the tale, only Hamlet's father could have provided Hamlet with the information the ghost did. \(Act 1, Sc 5\)
1.6.7. Con: -> See 1.4.6.1.1.
1.7. Con: True madness is seen more in Ophelia than in Hamlet; she is the character to truly become out of touch with reality, and there is no question of artifice.
1.7.1. Con: Ophelia's disconnection from reality does nothing to add to or reduce the madness that Hamlet embodies.
1.7.1.1. Con: Ophelia's madness exists as a direct contrast to Hamlet's, and in doing so, pressures the idea of Hamlet's madness. Ophelia's utter disconnection, against Hamlet's more manipulated and contrived 'madness', strongly suggests that Hamlet is falsifying his madness whilst Ophelia is not.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: Ophelia does not display utter disconnection. While her songs are inappropriate and seemingly random, in her conversation with Gertrude and Claudius she recognised them and the lyrics of her songs reflected the reasons for her despair. \(Act 4, Sc 5\)
1.7.2. Pro: Shakespeare shows us that Hamlet is not truly mad by contrasting his ruse; which allows him to take control of the situation and re-assert his agency in the face of universal deception, and Ophelia's true madness; which is borne of a total deprivation of agency and does not advance her motives.
1.7.2.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.
1.7.2.2. Con: Hamlet seems to have a psychotic disorder, possibly [Schizophreniform with violent tendencies](https://diagnosinghamlet.weebly.com/hamlet.html), while Ophelia's symptoms are more in line with [PTSD](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/274/and-i-of-ladies-most-deject-and-wretched-diagnosing-shakespeares-ophelia-with-post-traumatic-stress-disorder).
1.7.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.
1.7.3. Con: This assumes that there is only one kind of "madness", there are many different kinds of [psychological diagnosis](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-types-illness#1) and Ophelia and Hamlet may have different ones.
1.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.2.2.
1.8. Pro: Hamlet's behaviour throughout the play indicates his evident madness.
1.8.1. Con: The atmosphere often prevalent in the play is one of irrationality and strong feelings; murder, revenge, hatred, for example. In this context, Hamlet is not much more sane - in relation to the things happening - than the rest of the characters. This general atmosphere indicates Shakespeare didn't try to depict Hamlet as of strongly different mental composure compared to the other characters.
1.8.2. Con: Hamlet is to varying degrees throughout the play: despondent, angry, distraught, and frenzied. These are completely reasonable emotions for a person who is suffering in the way he is suffering; and in addition, Hamlet is a very intelligent man. His intellectual responses to his world are exceptional; thus, so are his emotional responses.
1.8.2.1. Pro: "Let be" \(Act V, sc2\) works to reconcile Hamlet's emotional and intellectual strife: his intellect dictates "If it be now, â€™tis not to come. If it be not to come, it will be now. If it be not now, yet it will comeâ€”the readiness is all". His emotions are finally at a point of peace, of acceptance. He cannot be rightly described as mad.
1.8.2.2. Pro: Hamlet is at university in Wittenburg, indicative of his intellect and academic prowess.
1.8.2.3. Con: Hamlet as a very intelligent man does have a stronger emotional reaction. This however could be an indication of mental illness. [Studies](http://bigthink.com/design-for-good/why-highly-intelligent-people-suffer-more-mental-and-physical-disorders) have found that people with a higher intelligence are more likely to suffer from mental illness.
1.8.3. Pro: Hamlet displays bursts of anger and violence throughout the play. These instances indicate an inability to control his emotions and actions.
1.8.3.1. Pro: Hamlet kills Claudius in a violent manner, both stabbing him and forcing him to drink poisoned wine \(Act 5, Scene ii\).
1.8.3.2. Pro: Hamlet is cruel and in a rage when he tells Ophelia "I loved you not" and "Get thee to a nunnery!" \(Act 3, scene i\).
1.8.3.3. Pro: He accidentally murders Polonius and shows no regret.
1.8.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.1.
1.8.4. Pro: Hamlet undergoes intense mood swings throughout the play, from suicidal to murderous to friendly.
1.8.4.1. Con: This is [fairly common](https://www.griefandsympathy.com/emotionsofgrief.html) for intense grief, although the extremities may be a little unusual.
1.8.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.2.
1.8.4.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.3.3.
1.8.6. Con: Hamlet is in an extremely stressful position, with the task of avenging his father's murder placed upon him. This could explain his erratic behaviour rather than madness.
1.8.7. Con: -> See 1.2.5.1.
1.8.8. Pro: His behaviour after Polonius's death, and before his return to Denmark, is particularly shocking.
1.8.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.3.1.2.1.
1.8.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.2.2.
1.8.8.3. Pro: "I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room" \(Act 3, iv\) and "you shall nose him" \(Act 4, iii\) are both utterly callous ways of treating a dead man, and at odds with the respect he affords to mourning duties regarding his father.
1.8.8.3.1. Con: Hamlet loved his father, but disliked Polonius. Therefore, he might continue to show respect for his father and disdain for Polonius after their respective deaths.
1.8.8.3.1.1. Con: Whether you dislike someone or not the way in which he talks about the body of Polonius, whom he murdered, is at odds with the way the average person would treat the corpse of a man he once knew.
1.9. Con: The play would be made weaker if Hamlet's madness was genuine.
1.9.1. Con: This is a subjective statement. Alternatively one may find a play about a prince's decline into madness after the death of his father, in which he gradually brings about the death of numerous people, a very compelling story.
1.9.1.1. Pro: [4.48 Psychosis](https://nypost.com/2014/10/20/suicide-play-448-psychosis-offers-a-cliche-mind-trip/) is arguably Sarah Kane's most well known play and it is entirely focused on the exploration of clinical depression and suicidal ideation. Its success demonstrates that there is an audience of people who are interested in plays examining mental illness and its impact.
1.9.2. Con: Hamlet's unpredictable behaviour is a major source of tension and excitement for the audience. If we believe that Hamlet's madness is genuine, then this aspect of the play is more compelling for the audience and the play is stronger as a result.
1.9.3. Con: It does not matter if the play is made weaker by the interpretation of Hamlet's madness as genuine if that is the most correct reading of the text.
1.9.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.
1.9.4. Pro: Part of the drama, and the audience's empathy for Hamlet, hinges on the implicit understanding that they are in on the secret: that Hamlet's lunacy is there to manipulate others, and is not genuine.
1.9.4.1. Con: One could alternatively say that part of the drama is the constant question; is it a ruse or is he actually mad? This greatly depends on the actor playing Hamlet and the acting decisions he takes.
1.9.5. Pro: Reducing powerful soliloquies such as "To be or not to be" \(Act 3, Scene i\) to merely the ramblings of a mentally unstable or depressed individual undermines their meaning. They reflect thoughtfully on troubling and universal existential, philosophical and emotional questions.
1.9.5.1. Con: -> See 1.2.5.2.
1.9.5.2. Con: Such a speech may be the ramblings of a mentally unstable individual, but this does not make them less important or interesting as existential musings. Perhaps Hamlet's depression allows him the clarity to consider such matters on a level not always accessible to others.
1.9.5.2.1. Pro: Shakespeare often used "[fools](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/discussion.php?id=fjqvbtqhrsot98xo6uhnv3nj)" to speak the most truthful and insightful lines so that the audience could take it in, but their words would not be taken seriously by the other characters and so influence the play. If Hamlet were indeed "mad" he would fit into the "fool" trope in a unique way as people also do not take seriously the ramblings of a mad man.
1.9.5.2.2. Con: If Hamlet's madness allows him to see the world, and more specifically the court of Elsinore as it really is, then he is not mad at all. Instead, we should consider those around Hamlet to be mad.
1.9.5.2.2.1. Con: Depressive Realism is a concept which emerged from a [study](https://www.yourtango.com/2017304246/why-depressed-people-see-world-more-realistically) conducted on depressed and healthy individuals. It was demonstrated in this study that those who suffered from depression saw the world more realistically than those without a mental illness.
