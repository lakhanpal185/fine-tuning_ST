Discussion Title: Is it Time to 'Free the Nipple'? Toplessness and Gender Equality in the US

1. Gender restrictions on nipple showing in the US should be eliminated.
1.1. Pro: Censoring nipples is oppressive to women.
1.1.1. Pro: Restricting nipple showing is sexist, harmful and unnatural. We have to reconnect with our bodies and stop seeing them as simple objects
1.1.1.1. Con: Nudity is not objectified or commoditized if there is consent of the subject who takes part in it. It is not the body which is a reward but the subject behind it.
1.1.2. Con: The [definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/oppression) of oppression is "a prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or exercise of authority." Censoring nipples is neither cruel nor unjust.
1.1.2.1. Pro: The benefit women get from showing nipples is less than the benefit society gets. For example, reducing [distractions](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/resources/tips/digital-family-life/internet-pornography-by-the-numbers) for [drivers](https://www.ideagrove.com/blog/sexy-billboards-more-dangerous-driving-distraction-than-cell-phones) by the display of legally sexual areas as it could increase traffic accidents \(a major death cause\). Preventing [false](https://academicmatters.ca/2011/10/false-allegations-of-sexual-harassment-misunderstandings-and-realities/) allegations of sexual harassment \([and the stress and fear of them\)](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/relationships/11904203/Well-done-feminism.-Now-man-are-afraid-to-help-women-at-work.html) which drain lots of time and money from the state.  And promoting [privacy](http://sourcesofinsight.com/personal-space/) which can be more [important](https://robindoherty.com/2016/01/06/nothing-to-hide.html) than self expression.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Explicit sexual displays or self promotion disturbs people while in their jobs or while they are more invested in another important activity, which can affect the people who benefit from those jobs or activities.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Neuroscientists [studied](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/201409/do-men-mostly-prefer-breasts-or-buns) the use of the internet and pornography and concluded that “breasts, no matter what size, are the most popular body part in sexual searches in every country we looked at, including the United States, Russia, India, Germany, Japan, and Saudi Arabia”; which supports that female nipples are a sexual trigger.
1.1.2.1.2.1. Con: While breasts will never stop being an erotic area, they can be seen in a nonsexual way. There are plenty of topless women who don't cause sexual arousal until they draw attention to their breasts in a sexual way.
1.1.2.1.2.2. Con: That does not support that female nipples in particular are distracting. It is thus not a justification to forbid exposed female nipples in contexts where partially exposed female breasts are otherwise acceptable.
1.1.2.1.3. Con: The determent women face as a result of being forced to censor themselves, and the society that creates, is greater then the benefit a few distractible people get in not being distracted.
1.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Society already requires all of us to censour ourselves in regard of displaying our genitals, having sex/self manipulation or doing our toilet activities in public, and we dont see that as against our personal rights.
1.1.2.1.4. Con: The distraction component would only be temporary, and would dissipate as bare nipples became more commonplace. This has already occurred historically, as other body parts that were once taboo can now be exposed without scandal \(such as legs, feet, shoulders, bellies, etc.\).
1.1.2.1.5. Pro: Men are also asked to wear shirts[while in some theme parks](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/19/right-ban-men-topless-essex-funfair-man-boobs) and [gyms](https://www.quora.com/Inequality-Why-do-some-gyms-disallow-shirtless-guys-exercising), and [soccer players receive a penalty](http://www.fifa.com/development/news/y=2004/m=6/news=clarification-law-yellow-card-for-removal-jersey-92958.html) if they remove their jerseys; so censourship is not considered to be against constitutional or universal rights of the individual.
1.1.2.1.5.1. Con: This discussion has no bearing on the rights of private organizations to regulate dress codes, etc. on their own premises. This is about what should be legal in public spaces not within the purview of private entities.
1.1.2.1.5.2. Con: Toplessness equality for women would also entail woman being asked to cover on specific private premises or under specific private rules \(such sports\).
1.1.2.1.6. Pro: False rape accusations are [real](http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/wrongfully-convicted-brian-banks-disgusted-brock-turner-ruling-article-1.2663595), and can destroy someone's life and waste millions of dollars in jail resources.
1.1.2.1.6.1. Pro: False accusations make it impossible for the accused to lead a normal life even after acquittal, and they deserve recompense.
1.1.2.1.6.1.1. Pro: False accusations hurt the families of the accused.
1.1.2.1.6.1.2. Pro: Harm would be in form of defamation \(both slander and libel\), and can be very damaging to the reputation and quality of life for the accused.
1.1.2.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: There is a huge mental strain on being falsely accused and it can have lifelong implications [My best friend’s killer got away - until I made police try again http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-44470377](http://My best friend’s killer got away - until I made police try again http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-44470377)
1.1.2.1.6.1.2.2. Pro: Perjury, defamation, libel, slander, harassment, incitement of violence; a false rape accusation is a smorgasboard of crimes all done with intent to destroy someone's life.
1.1.2.1.6.1.2.2.1. Con: Defamation, libel, and slander are generally not crimes - they are civil offenses.
1.1.2.2. Pro: Censoring nipples is not oppressive but just a standard of decency that has emerged in [almost all cultures.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toplessness#In_Western_culture)
1.1.2.2.1. Con: Toplessness was customary in many [cultures](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/43gy7n/the-history-of-toplessness) until the rise of monotheistic religion. Religion has often been used  for [social control](https://www.jstor.org/stable/7045?seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents) in general and to oppress women in particular.
1.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: In [traditional societies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toplessness) in North America, Africa, Australia and Pacific Islands toplessness was customary - and that changed through Christian missionaries. It 'was the norm in various Asian cultures before Muslim expansion'.
1.1.2.2.1.2. Con: Most religions, including those original from East Asia, [recognize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modesty) modesty \(covering the naked body\) as a virtue or moral standard, and even ancient cultures \(including Japan´s\) [regarded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_nudity) clothing as the luxury of higher classes, or the norm for married women. In [China](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/11007686/Why-were-now-so-prudish-about-nudity.html), a stern tradition of Confucian rectitude makes public nudity unacceptable, and even in the few naturist centres that exist, the sexes tend to be segregated
1.1.2.2.2. Con: Western civilizations have colonized many parts of the world, often forcing societies to conform to their values and standards. Therefore the consensus is not authentic.
1.1.2.2.2.1. Pro: [Russia was heavily influenced by the influence of Orthodox Christianity arrived though the Byzantine Empire to adopt Western/Roman values.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toplessness)
1.1.2.3. Con: What is deemed unjust can be subjective, yet it is undeniable that women’s freedom in the social and political sphere have historically been limited and controlled and that “unjust treatment’ extends to the control of clothing and appearance.
1.1.3. Pro: Laws like this are in place to further subjugate women into a secondary class of citizens. Women that are empowered to fully make their own decisions are a threat to the status quo.
1.1.4. Pro: Society censors what it finds harmful to the public. Thus, censoring women's nipples implies that they are in some way harmful to society. In turn, this can oppress women's ability to accept their bodies as something positive.
1.1.4.1. Con: This statement is a textbook example of the fallacy [affirming the consequence](https://criticalthinkeracademy.com/courses/formal-fallacies/lectures/1106135). Nipples are not censored because they are seen as "harmful to society", but because they, in our culture, have the role of carrying sexual signals.
1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Associating certain body parts with a sexual charge is a natural part of human culture, and to maintain that sexual charge, these body parts have to generally remain secluded or else they lose the association over time.
1.1.4.2. Con: The logic of this argument is not particular to nipples, but applies to any and all censoring of bodies. By this logic, societal censoring of genitalia must also imply that genitals are in some way harmful to society, and oppresses people's ability to accept their bodies as something positive.
1.1.4.2.1. Con: Society does not allow the exposure of genitals for both men and women as it is believed it may not be appropriate in social and professional situations and thus harmful. However, when society only censors women’s nipples in some situations where men’s are not censored \(e.g.: social media pictures, leisure spaces like the beach\), society is definitely sending the message that female nipples are somehow harmful or something that needs to be hidden.
1.1.4.3. Con: Restriction on nipple showing is not intended to promote shame but privacy; as long as nipples are censored only to the public eye \(strangers\) and not in private \(to friends and close ones\); with the exception of mutually consented public displays like in festivals or secure sex commerce.
1.1.4.3.1. Con: The privacy described is a personal choice, not a choice for others to make on one's behalf.
1.1.4.3.2. Con: Intentions do not change consequences. Even if privacy is the intention of laws restricting female nipple exposure, the reality is that they cause some women shame.
1.1.4.3.2.1. Con: Is there evidence that it is legal restrictions that cause this shame and not some other law that causes it and then the individual projects that the law is the cause?
1.1.4.3.3. Pro: Nipples are the openings of exocrine glands that in women can have abnormal [secretions](https://www.verywell.com/the-ins-and-outs-of-nipple-changes-430663) during any time of life, get erected by cold stimulation or sexual excitement \(much more visibly than in men\), get lumps or bumps and change color and size of areola during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, so their display can break [personal space](http://sourcesofinsight.com/personal-space/) and privacy \(which is stressful\), affect public sensibilities and also be a [window](https://www.m.webmd.boots.com/a-to-z-guides/why-do-my-nipples-hurt) for infections, allergies, and irritation. \(also argued by the [FCC censorship](http://rebrn.com/re/eli-in-the-usa-why-does-the-fcc-allow-all-of-a-female-breast-to-129679/)\)
1.1.4.3.3.1. Con: None of these features of breasts/nipples affects the "personal space" or "privacy" of others in the least. The medical sources cited present good reasons why women might choose to keep their nipples covered most of the time, but do not amount to a compelling reason to require that they do so by law.
1.1.4.3.3.1.1. Con: It affects privacy or personal space of others due to the fact that it could show sexual excitation.
1.1.4.3.3.1.2. Con: It could affect personal space or privacy, because due to the fact of its strict connection to sex, even if not stimulated by sexual factors it would be affected same or simmilar way, therefore would bring mental conotation to highly sexual sphere.
1.1.4.3.3.2. Con: Exocrine milk glands are indeed [not female-only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_lactation), and milk producing cells are present in the breast tissue of every [male](https://www.livescience.com/45732-can-men-lactate.html) and female.
1.1.4.3.3.2.1. Con: Even though milk glands are present in men breast also they could rarely be used as milk producers due to lack of adequate hormones.
1.1.4.3.3.3. Con: The claim that something could be a window for infections, allergies and irritation is not a valid reason for banning it. That would be the woman's own decision to risk or not.
1.1.4.3.4. Con: Society as a whole will be oppressing women when they decide it is detrimental to show a natural part of a women's body. When saying that it's "detrimental" society makes women ashamed of a part of their body they didn't have a decision in having.
1.1.4.3.5. Pro: Some women [feel shame](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lorynbrantz/i-went-to-a-nude-beach-and-it-was-kind-of-a-nightmare?utm_term=.ixBzx1YeL6#.xuyGKpYLa6)[and uncomfortable even in contexts where top freedom is allowed](https://thetab.com/2015/08/19/naked-beach-spain-absolutely-terrifying-50672), so the restriction is not causing the shame and is not necessarily benefitial to women.
1.1.4.4. Pro: Promoting body positive attitudes can be beneficial to health. For example, educating women on checking for signs of breast cancer is easier when women's breasts and nipples are not seen as shameful.
1.1.4.4.1. Pro: Since showing nipples is not allowed, a breast cancer organization in Argentina used a [man's bare chest](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/breast-cancer-video-censorship_us_571a4b5be4b0d0042da9031b) to teach women how to do breast examinations for early cancer detection. If there is such a difference between men and women's breasts, then being able to show a woman's chest for the sake of saving lives should be acceptable.
1.1.4.5. Pro: Liberal attitudes towards nipple showing can promote [body positivity](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1381295/Why-children-confusing-messages-bodies.html) in children, teaching them not to be ashamed of their bodies.
1.1.4.5.1. Con: Teaching a child to respect and [love their body](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/05/raising-kids-body-image/) can be done without promoting the liberation of a woman's body part.
1.1.4.5.2. Pro: Exposing children and society in general to realistic nude breasts in addition to the idealized ones they might see on TV could lead to a healthier body image, since they will understand that breasts come in a variety of shapes and sizes.
1.1.4.5.2.1. Pro: One [study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S174014451630208X) found that playing with 'unrealistically' thin dolls promotes body dissatisfaction in young girls.
1.1.4.5.2.2. Pro: According to a Dove social media study, [82 percent](http://www.glamour.com/story/social-media-self-esteem) of women feel the standards of beauty set by social media are 'unrealistic'.
1.1.4.5.2.2.1. Con: This does not address one of the core elements of the parent statement, which is that unequal clothing legislation cannot oppress women at the same time that unrealistic beauty standards oppress women. It is possible that multiple factors oppress women, therefore the agreement of 82% of women that one factor oppresses women does not support the claim that no other factors oppress women.
1.1.4.5.3. Con: Girls going through puberty often compare their bodies to others, which can lead to developing a negative body image. Seeing nude breasts may thus lead to more occasions for comparison.
1.1.4.5.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.2.
1.1.4.5.3.2. Pro: Fifty-three percent of [pubescent girls](http://www.heartofleadership.org/statistics/) are unhappy with their body, and studies show this number increases to 73% by the time they are 17 years old. Seeing other women's exposed nipples will likely create more body dissatisfaction among these girls.
1.1.4.5.3.3. Con: Girls often compare their bodies via social and traditional media. In their daily lives, they can still compare themselves to others both when clothed, especially in tight clothing, as well as unclothed in private spaces \(e.g. locker rooms\). As this will continue regardless of restrictions on nipple showing, there is no reason to keep such restrictions in place.
1.1.4.5.3.4. Con: Many women use undergarments such as corsets, girdles, and push-up bras to shape their bodies to match unrealistic beauty standards, leaving passersby none the wiser about the fact that their body does not actually look like that. It is thus important for impressionable girls to be exposed to nude breasts so they can see that these beauty standards are largely unattainable by everyone.
1.1.4.5.3.5. Pro: Not all women are pressured towards exposing their body in the status quo; rather, those who do not conform to certain standards of beauty are often [body-shamed](http://www.yourdictionary.com/body-shaming), so they might feel uncomfortable exposing their bodies.
1.1.4.5.3.5.1. Con: If women were allowed to expose their nipples in public, then more people would see that breasts come in a variety of shapes and sizes. This would help normalize breast variation and could eventually change the current beauty standard.
1.1.4.5.3.6. Con: Comparing penis size is [very common](http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/penis-sizes) and sociable among boys.
1.1.4.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.1.4.5.5. Pro: It is [important](http://www.phdinparenting.com/blog/2009/3/13/what-gives-you-the-right.html) for children to see breasts being used to feed infants before discovering them as sexually arousing when they enter puberty. This will help them to develop a healthy understanding of the female body.
1.1.4.6. Pro: Censoring nipples has led to a lack of education about them. Thus many women are ashamed and confused to ask about many [benign](https://www.bustle.com/articles/47910-why-your-nipples-are-itchy-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-about-your-headlights) health issues relating to the nipples.
1.1.4.7. Con: What oppresses women's ability to positively accept their bodies are the [unrealistic beauty standards](http://www.sirc.org/publik/mirror.html) placed on them by the media, not censoring nipples.
1.1.4.7.1. Con: There is no reason to assume there is one cause for a lack of body positivist. That unrealistic beauty standards is a cause does not imply that nipple censorship is not also a cause.
1.1.4.7.2. Con: Unrealistic beauty standards do not eliminate the possibility that unequal clothing legislation does not also oppress women.
1.1.4.7.3. Con: Although women face different sources of oppression, and unrealistic beauty standards are indeed oppressive, restrictive dress codes - especially the ones directed only towards women - also have a negative impact.
1.1.4.7.4. Con: Women already live in a society that pressures them to achieve impossible beauty standards and objectifies their bodies. Giving women the freedom to decide how to expose their bodies gives them agency, as they become subjects rather than objects for the [male gaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze).
1.1.4.7.4.1. Pro: These norms come from the Western beauty standards that promote the [sexual objectification and consumption](http://www.blackballad.co.uk/is-social-media-nudity-ever-empowering-for-women/) of women's bodies.
1.1.4.7.4.1.1. Pro: These Western values are affecting other societies in the world, such [Lebanon and South Korea](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/why-are-asian-women-aspiring-to-western-ideals-of-beauty-2136868.html).
1.1.4.7.4.2. Con: A movement like [#FreeTheNipple](http://freethenipple.com/), that relies on naked breasts to fight patriarchy, might actually reinforce the male gaze instead of fighting it.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1. Pro: Allowing women to show their nipples won't really erase decades of stereotyping and sexism that contribute to how we view the female body or deconstruct societal notions of what it means to be a woman.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.1. Pro: Posting photos on social media will not achieve the real goal of the topless equality movement, which is not only the right to bare breasts but rather a larger mental shift toward normalizing women's bodies for the betterment of their entire social standing.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2. Pro: Furthermore, considering the effort needed to erase the male gaze, a hashtag is clearly not sufficient to achieve equality.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.1. Pro: Showing breasts on social media can be considered an indirect form of oppression. This brand of feminism on social media, regarded as ["feminism-lite](http://www.feministcurrent.com/2015/04/20/freethenipple-or-freemaledesire-has-social-media-really-been-good-for-feminism/)”, is criticized as it seems to focus on a woman’s individual right to objectify herself showing nipples and pandering to the male gaze.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.2.1.1.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.1.2. Pro: While such behavior is being sold back to women as empowering, men are able to share and download these images countless times for their own purposes.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.1.3. Con: The extensive use of social media, which has been described as "hashtag feminism", is an important tool, particularly for women who've been marginalized. It serves to draw [public attention](http://time.com/3319081/whyistayed-hashtag-feminism-activism/) to their struggles, raise awareness, and make their voices heard, thus reclaiming the 1970s slogan “The personal is political".
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.1.3.1. Con: Supposedly empowering hashtags are often merely ["femvertizing"](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/12/femvertising-branded-feminism): selling empowerment to push a product.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Proctor & Gamble's brand "Always", a line of sanitary products, advertised with the successful [#LikeAGirl](http://www.always.com/en-us/about-us/our-epic-battle-like-a-girl) campaign that is ongoing.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Even if it helped sell a product, the campaign’s video received more than 85 million views and helped raise awareness about using “like a girl” as a [derogatory](https://www.dandad.org/en/d-ad-always-like-a-girl-campaign-case-study-insights/) phrase.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.1.3.1.2. Con: [Fifty-one percent](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/02/femvertising-advertising-empowering-women_n_5921000.html) of women polled like ads with a pro-female stance because they believe they break down patriarchal gender barriers. Thus, 'femvertizing' is ultimately helpful in achieving gender equality for issues such as nipple restrictions.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.1.3.2. Pro: Campaigns like [#WhyIStayed](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WhyIStayed&amp;src=typd) are opening up spaces for women and amplifying voices so they cannot be easily dismissed.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.2. Con: While a hashtag is not enough to achieve equality, campaigns organised online \(and with offline repercussions\) have helped change oppressive policies.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: Some social media platforms have [changed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/facebook-rape-jokes-protest_n_3349319.html) their policies to make women feel safer and to allow non-sexualised images \(such as [breastfeeding](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/freethenipple-facebook-changes_b_5473467.html)\), yet that has been thanks to the continuous efforts from [organisations](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/05/31/facebook-kicks-out-rape-jokes-and-gender-hate-speech/) fighting sexism.
1.1.4.7.4.2.1.3. Con: However, even if it does not completely erase harmful stereotypes and sexism, it is a step in that direction.
1.1.4.7.4.2.2. Con: An important part of the male gaze theory is not only that women are objects but ways in which they can become subjects \(for example, being behind the camera\). It is difficult to assert subjectivity when women, unlike men, are denied the right to choose how they show themselves.
1.1.4.7.4.2.2.1. Pro: Sexualised images of women’s bodies which circumvent the rules by avoiding nipples are widely used in advertising, music, media and art. It is unjust and hypocritical that when women choose to freely expose themselves, they are censored.
1.1.4.7.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Alluring pictures of highly sexualized women without showing a nipple retain an air of mystery, making those pictures more alluring and making the nipple more rare and therefore more desired.
1.1.4.7.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con: As nipple restrictions are generally in place to not offend others and to avoid indecency, the fact that nipples remain more alluring or desired because they are often covered does not seem to bear relevance.
1.1.4.7.4.2.2.1.1.2. Con: Correlation does not equal causation. Just because nipple exposure is rare \(because it is illegal\) does not necessarily mean that it is the reason men desire it. It is built into the DNA of a man to be attracted to exposed breasts, whether nudity was illegal or not.
1.1.4.7.4.2.2.1.2. Pro: Highly sexualized pictures of women's breasts are widely allowed on social media as long as nipples are covered. This is hypocritical.
1.1.4.7.4.2.2.1.2.1. Pro: The idea that men can decide on the level of appropriateness of women body is flawed and should not be consider as a valid source for limitation. A man can go out and mow the lawn without a shirt, but a woman can not.
1.1.4.7.4.2.2.1.2.2. Pro: Nipples do not define "nudity". If an image of a nude woman is photoshopped to remove the nipples, she is still as nude as with nipples. It's not the nipples that define wether a body is nude or not.
1.1.4.7.4.2.3. Con: If pornographic or [violent](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/the-unsafety-net-how-social-media-turned-against-women/381261/) images of women’s bodies that appeal to the male gaze are acceptable, but when women themselves show their [bodies](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/freethenipple-facebook-changes_b_5473467.html) end up being shamed or censored, [sexism](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/30/opinion/chemaly-facebook/) and hypocrisy are behind that censoring rationale.
1.1.4.7.4.2.3.1. Con: Without a qualifying argument, this is equally a reason for the banning of pornographic and violent portrayals of the female body as it is for the acceptance of female nudity.
1.1.4.7.4.2.3.2. Con: This does not mean that all rationales for censoring female nipples are hypocritical. It should not be assumed, nor is it true, that such pornographic or violent images of women's bodies are considered acceptable by all men, or that all choose to consume them. One can generally avoid seeing any porn if one so chooses, the same would not be true for female nipples in public, unless one avoided all public places.
1.1.4.7.4.2.3.2.1. Con: [Sex and nudity have been used in advertising basicly since it was possible to do so, all the way to online today.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_in_advertising) So nudity is not at all easy to avoid.
1.1.4.7.4.2.3.2.1.1. Con: Not easy yet possible in ones own private life if they so desire. But would not be able to expect to avoid it in public if it was lawful to expose more of oneself in public.
1.1.4.7.4.2.3.2.1.1.1. Con: Nudity is everywhere, avoiding it online, or in person, is possible in a theoretical sense, but in practice, it breaks down quickly.
1.1.4.7.4.2.3.2.1.1.2. Con: If one wanted to avoid nudity, they could join the equivalent of a nudist colony today, and live in a community where everyone wore clothes, it would not be easy, but it would be possible.

1.1.4.7.4.2.3.4. Pro: For example, images of [breast](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/20/facebook-bans-breast-cancer-video-square-breasts) [cancer](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/facebook-bans-mastectomy-pix-anger-cancer-survivors-article-1.1363623) survivors, trans women, [old](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/web-culture/how-facebook-decides-which-female-breasts-you-can-see-20160315-gnjdub.html) women or women [breastfeeding](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/clint-edwards/facebook-censored-breastfeeding-sadly-i-wasnt-surprised_b_7992078.html) or in [labour](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/22/facebook-removing-childbirth-female-images) have been censored.
1.1.4.7.4.2.3.5. Pro: Despite Facebook guidelines against hate speech, many posts promoting or depicting violence against women have been allowed. When the system seems to fail particularly in one aspect, it is fair to assume that the individuals in charge of reviewing what is appropriate or not, apply their own [sexist](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/30/opinion/chemaly-facebook/) views resulting in hypocritical and unfair standards.
1.1.4.7.4.2.4. Pro: Femen was [founded by a man](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/04/femen-man-topless-protests-victor-vyatski) who stated in interviews he started the group to meet women, as well as "hand-selecting" the prettiest girls for the topless protests.
1.1.4.7.4.2.5. Pro: Dozens of women protesting topless in [Argentina](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/08/women-argentina-topless-protest-right-to-sunbathe-semi-nude) were joined by hundreds of clothed people, many of which were male gawkers.
1.1.4.7.4.2.5.1. Con: Protests - even if they included male gawkers - raised awareness about the issue in Argentina and propelled actual change: a judge ruled that laws regarding public indecency were [unconstitutional](http://elpais.com/elpais/2017/02/08/inenglish/1486551914_099730.html) and should be overturned.

1.1.4.7.7. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.3.5.1.
1.1.4.8. Pro: Social media removes posts of women's nipples, however posts involving violent acts such as shootings or torture are not. This could imply that women's nipples are more harmful.
1.1.5. Pro: Once prohibitions are lifted, there may be people that go too far, especially at first, but there is also a self-empowering, artistic, and independent expression to be gained.
1.1.6. Pro: Restricting nipple showing promotes shaming of women's bodies.
1.1.6.1. Con: When there are no restrictions on nipple-showing, this gives license to men or other women to shame women who do not want to expose their nipples.
1.1.6.1.1. Con: The existence of free speech means that regardless of their decisions, people will always face the possibility of being shamed.
1.1.6.1.2. Con: Giving more freedom will allow those who go topless to be more understanding of those who don't, whereas in a society that forbids it, the ones who choose not to expose themselves shame those who would like to.
1.1.6.1.2.1. Pro: In a recent survey, 80% of American women responded that they would like to sunbathe [topless](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-mulhall/is-america-ready-for-topless-sunbathing_b_1827990.html) while only 12% said they would not as they were too self-conscious or thought it was wrong. Removing the restriction simply allows women to choose.
1.1.6.1.3. Pro: If nipple showing will expose women to more abuse or violence, then it should be restricted.
1.1.6.1.3.1. Pro: American women and girls still experience sexual violence at high rates: [1 out of every 6 American women](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence) has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime. Showing their breasts might increase this tendency.
1.1.6.1.3.1.1. Con: [Studies](https://anabagail.wordpress.com/2014/03/14/research-on-the-relationship-between-rape-and-dressing/) have shown that sexual harassment/assault is about power, and offenders tend to target those whom they believe can be easily dominated. Therefore a woman who is exposing her nipples would not be an ideal target for a sex offender, since such a liberal clothing choice indicates confidence and assertiveness.
1.1.6.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Some psychologists share the [belief](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201104/is-rape-about-control-or-sex) that in many instances, rape and sexual assault are more about sexual gratification than power, particularly when the assailant is someone whom the victim knows. Since nipples are highly sexualized, public nipple exposure could lead to an increase in such situations.
1.1.6.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con: The same author, who mainly discusses date rape, also asserts that it “is a sexual crime but it is also about who controls the interaction”.
1.1.6.1.3.1.1.1.2. Con: The construct behind date rape is men seeing women as objects they are entitled to for their sexual gratification. Therefore even if sexual gratification is indeed a goal, control and assertion of power still play a big role.
1.1.6.1.3.1.1.1.3. Con: The quoted reference seems to be the opinion of a single researcher. More in-depth studies found that [acquaintance rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_rape#Perpetrators_and_motivations) is sexual violence committed by violent [serial predators](http://www.davidlisak.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/SARUnderstandingPredatoryNatureSexualViolence.pdf).
1.1.6.1.3.2. Pro: Restricting nipple showing protects women from unwanted sexual harassment.
1.1.6.1.3.2.1. Con: Women wouldn't be forced to show their nipples. Restricting them for their own safety suggests that women can't be trusted to make safe decisions for themselves.
1.1.6.1.3.2.1.1. Pro: Women showing their breasts and nipples are fully capable of judging the risks of receiving unwanted attention and consequently addressing such attention on their own.
1.1.6.1.3.2.1.2. Pro: If a woman is afraid that she will be harassed if her nipples are showing, she can choose to cover her nipples. "Freeing the nipple" is only about making it *permissible* for a woman to show her nipples, not *mandatory*.
1.1.6.1.3.2.2. Pro: Positive comments about someone's nipples could offend men or women in their life.
1.1.6.1.3.2.2.1. Con: The point of eliminating restrictions is to allow women freedom to choose how they dress, instead of having it decided for them. Under this premise, some women will undoubtedly choose not to show nipples.
1.1.6.1.3.2.2.2. Con: If the purpose of the ban is to shield people from receiving comments about their nipples, then the ban should extend to men as well.
1.1.6.1.3.2.2.3. Con: Women are already subjected to inappropriate comments about their breasts or body, regardless of what they are wearing. A situation in which someone made unwelcome comments about a shirtless woman would be dealt with in the same way that such comments are dealt with today.
1.1.6.1.3.2.3. Con: A harasser chooses to harass, not because they are "provoked", by a freely dressed woman but because they do not care about violating the woman's boundaries regardless of how they are dressed.  This is the same logic which informs mandatory female modesty laws in some countries.
1.1.6.1.3.2.4. Con: The premise is to allow women to choose to be topless, not to force them to do so. While harassment should be eliminated by men, any woman who feels that she would have less harassment by concealing her nipples is free to do so.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5. Pro: If a woman's breast is to be considered no more sexual than a man's, then they could lose that extra legal protection.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.1. Con: In most legal jurisdictions, 'where' someone was touched is less important than 'how' someone was touched.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.1.1. Pro: According to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \(EEOC\) [sexual harassment](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm) can include sexual comments, unwelcome sexual advancements, or offensive remarks about a particular sex. The harasser and victim can be of the same sex and either man or woman.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.1.2. Pro: Legislation, in order to avoid loopholes and be broad enough, generally does not specify victims' gender. Therefore, it would be highly unusual for a law to state explicitly that touching a woman's breast is sexual assault and touching a man's is not.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.1.2.1. Pro: Destroying the construct that over-sexualizes female breasts, would not remove legal protection from unwanted touching in that area for both genders.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.2. Pro: The definition of sexual harassment includes the touching of the breast\(s\) regardless of sex. However, the social construct will always trump the letter of the law. In a topless world under the current social construct, it will be impossible for women's breasts to be treated the exact same way as a man, especially the touching of the breast\(s\). This reveals the hypocrisy and incoherence of this movement.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.2.1. Con: Part of the purpose in proposing the equitable treatment of male and female nipples / breasts is to change the social construct regarding female anatomy.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.2.2. Con: Sexual harassment refers more to the notion of coercion and bullying. Unwelcome advances fall under the definition of sexual assault.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3. Pro: There is a sexual element to women's breasts because sexual desirability is, at its most basic, based on biological factors like youth and fertility. A man's breast area is not as essentially linked to sexual attraction or eroticized as much. Therefore a woman would be unlikely to touch a man's breast area with sexual intent in the same way as a man might touch a woman's.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3.1. Con: Men's breasts are not less sexualized than women's. [Many women](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/12/12/women-rate-the-strongest-men-as-the-most-attractive-study-finds/?utm_term=.9608ecfbb368) are turned on by a nice set of pecs, much the same as men are turned on by a nice pair of breasts.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3.1.1. Pro: Men should be required by law to wear at least a tank top \(even if translucent as women can also wear bikini strings and translucent tops\) in the same contexts women are required to cover nipples; so as to at least imply the intention to cover controversial features such as chest hair, a muscular torso or nipples.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.1. Con: There is no reason to defend decency.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.2. Con: There is no reason a lack of chest covering defends decency.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.3. Con: Implied intent is a lie, and intent without results is useless.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3.2. Con: Just because it is currently sexualised, does not mean that this is due to some inherently sexualised aspect of the part. It could very well be due to cultural factors, such as where certain physical attributes are more desirable than others, differing across culture. If these areas were socially desensitised it may follow that they are no longer seen as erotic.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3.2.1. Con: Breasts are a secondary sexual characteristic.  In other primates, they swell when the female is in heat to trigger mating. Human females “trick” males by displaying continuously. Male hormones aren’t going away because we expose a lot of breasts.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.4. Con: Women are restricted from touching men's nipples, and chest, it just isn't emphasized as much because people tend not to have as much a problem with it.
1.1.6.1.3.2.5.5. Pro: If a man is touched on the chest, it isn't considered to be particularly invasive. Contrarily, if a woman's chest is touched, it is considered sexual assault. If we push for women's bodies to be treated the same as men's, this boundary that exists for women now, might be compromised.
1.1.6.1.3.2.6. Con: This assumes that the nudity is the problem behind the sexual attacks but sexual attacks occur even in the context of no nudity or suggestion of nudity at all.
1.1.6.1.3.2.6.1. Con: This does not assume nudity to be the primary reason of all sexual attacks, but nudity is a reason behind some sexual attacks. This means that increasing nudity will increase sexual attacks.
1.1.6.1.3.2.6.2. Pro: Sexual aggression should never be blamed upon the victim.
1.1.6.1.3.2.7. Pro: [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26566899) found that nudity is a dis-inhibiting cue in date rape analogues. So, for better or for worse, female nudity does seem to currently dis-inhibit rapists. Whether this can be combated by increasing female nudity in public is an empirical question, not one of moral imperative.
1.1.6.1.3.2.7.1. Con: Suggesting that nudity is the cause is a false correlation. The behavior that resulted in a rape being committed was caused by a lifetime of experience and reinforcement on the part of the rapist, and while any trigger could have caused that behavior, to suggest that the cause is solely responsible is to discount the rapist's history and autonomy. If nudity was the cause, then 100% of nude women would be raped.
1.1.6.1.3.2.7.1.1. Con: A trigger is not a primary cause of a crime, just a helping event; but if there are laws already being enforced against the primary cause of sexual violence \(rapists and harassers\) but the problem is not yet controlled, it is reasonable to censor the triggers and disinhibiting cues also \(provided that the censorship doesn´t trigger more serious issues than the sexual violence itself\).
1.1.6.1.3.2.7.1.1.1. Con: It is not reasonable to censor the triggers and disinhibiting cues if that censorship entails the limiting of others rights.
1.1.6.1.3.2.7.1.1.2. Con: An expensive watch or other jewellery could be classified as a trigger and disinhibiting cue for a robber, risking wearing these in public is still a persons right.
1.1.6.1.3.2.7.2. Con: That someone's behavior makes them more likely to be the victim of a crime is not a compelling reason to make that behavior illegal. For example, it's not illegal to leave your car doors unlocked.
1.1.6.1.3.2.7.3. Con: This only serves to impute to the victim the guilt of the crime. It is the State's duty to provide women with security so that they can fully exercise their rights, as opposed to curbing their rights in favor of their security.
1.1.6.1.3.2.8. Pro: Nipple restriction can also reduce situations where women could [fake or wrongly claim](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/WorkingWounded/story?id=89228&page=1) being sexually harassed by others, as they can [either](https://academicmatters.ca/2011/10/false-allegations-of-sexual-harassment-misunderstandings-and-realities/) ignore how it is defined, benefit from it or use it as a threat or an attack on enemies.
1.1.6.1.3.2.8.1. Pro: If no restrictions are in place, someone can unintentionally commit repeated actions \(even after asked to stop\) that can be made to look as harassment without actually being it.
1.1.6.1.3.2.8.1.1. Con: If the person is not told to stop, it is not harassment. If a person fails to modify their behavior to prevent repeated accidents, it ceases to be an accident.
1.1.6.1.3.2.9. Pro: More sexuality in society will result in a more sexual society. Sexual harassment, rape, and sexual violence as possible outcomes will be relatively worse than the positives that lifting restrictions can bring.
1.1.6.1.3.2.9.1. Con: In [Middle Eastern](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2017/6/20/sexual-assault-in-mena-caused-by-fragile-male-ego) societies where women are entirely clad from head to toe, cases of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment are high. This could illustrate that the problem lies not with how much skin is showing but the culture around the issue and education people receive on human rights.
1.1.6.1.3.2.9.2. Con: Sexual violence is more common in [societies](http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/norms.pdf) with cultural norms that limit women's freedom or blame women for not controlling the sexual desires or men.
1.1.6.1.3.2.10. Con: Removing the taboo of exposed breasts could result in less sexual harassment and exploitation of women.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11. Con: The same is said about full coverage clothing for women \(burqa\). This is false as rates of sexual harassment is [not lower](http://www.womensmediacenter.com/women-under-siege/the-myth-of-how-the-hijab-protects-women-against-sexual-assault) in countries/[communities](http://time.com/3918215/modesty-culture-rape-culture/) where women are required to dress "modestly". Even if it were true, it would not give anyone the right to ban women from wearing the same clothes as their male counterparts.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1. Pro: Since [studies](http://chartsbin.com/view/38592) have found that sexual violence is more prevalent in countries that are sexually conservative, instituting sexually liberal policies would actually make women safer in the long run.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.1. Con: Sweden and Denmark, both countries known to be 'sexually liberal', have the highest number of [sexual assaults](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-and-denmark-have-highest-number-of-sexual-assaults-in-europe-a6800901.html) in Europe.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.1.1. Con: Sweden's high rate of rape is largely due to the fact that they have [redefined](http://www.government.se/articles/2017/02/facts-about-migration-and-crime-in-sweden/) the definition of the crime to include acts that many other places in the world do not consider as rape.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.2. Pro: South Africa, a sexually conservative country, has one of the [highest occurrences](http://rapecrisis.org.za/rape-in-south-africa/#prevalence) of rape in the world \(147 cases reported a day\).
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.2.1. Con: This claim is correlation without providing a rationale for causation. There are many other reasons why South Africa may have one of the highest rates of rape in the world that have nothing to do with their sexual attitudes. As a counter-example: Utah is one of the most sexually conservative states but has an [average rape occurrence](http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/03/opinion/sutter-alaska-rape-list/index.html).
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.3. Con: Implementing one policy may not change how sexually liberal American society is overall.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.3.1. Con: Through this kind of reasoning we should do nothing to improve conditions of women if it doesn't change said conditions drastically. Advancing in little steps is preferable to taking big leaps.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.9.2.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.5. Con: The text attached to the [linked chart](http://chartsbin.com/view/38592) makes no claims as to the causal relationship between sexual violence and sexual conservatism.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.6. Con: [The US](http://katehon.com/389-top-10-countries-with-highest-rape-crime.html), which is considered a very liberal country, has a very high occurrence of rape.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.6.1. Con: The fact that some consider the United States to be "a very liberal country" with regards to sexuality does not in fact establish that the country *is*, in fact, sexually liberal. Given the current treatment of women with regards to rape or promiscuity or abortion or sex education, it could be easily argued that the United States is, in fact, a sexually conservative nation.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.6.2. Con: There are countries [more liberal](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/women-full-list) than the US that have a lower rate of rape. If we were to accept the US as evidence of this association, we would have to also accept all of these countries, which there are at least two of, as evidence to the contrary, which would lead us to reject this hypothesis.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.6.3. Con: A sample size of one country is worthless.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.6.4. Pro: The U.S is the leader of the free world, the most influential capitalist system in the world; most western countries follow the trails of the U.S. It can't be said to be worthless as sample. Also in a set of very few influential countries \(The G8 for example\) a sample of 1 is relevant.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.6.4.1. Con: [We aren't the world leader in gender equality .](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/11/19/us-falls-28th-global-gender-equality-list/76018174/)
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.6.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.1.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.6.6. Con: The problem with these types of statistics is that they do not show a total number of rape occurrences but a number of reported rapes and rape is generally an [underreported](http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf) crime. That is probably why liberal countries with better protections towards women such the US, Germany, France or Canada are also included in the list. Therefore, it does not point to more rapes but to more rapes reported.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.7. Con: [Seven out of the ten countries](http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/why-does-latin-america-have-the-world-s-highest-female-murder-rates) with the highest rate of violence against women in the world are in Latin America, where human trafficking and organized crime seem to play a more significant role than conservative sexuality.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.7.1. Con: Even if organised crime and human trafficking play a role, the fact that this violence is vastly directed towards women is indeed related to a very sexist and oppressive culture.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.7.1.1. Pro: For example, gang related deaths are often men, yet sometimes women, as they are considered [property](http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/why-does-latin-america-have-the-world-s-highest-female-murder-rates) of gang members
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.7.1.2. Pro: [Domestic violence](http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/why-does-latin-america-have-the-world-s-highest-female-murder-rates) is also a big contributor to high femicide rates.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.7.2. Con: Harmful [sexist](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/The-Trend-of-Femicides-in-Latin-America-on-the-Rise-in-2017-20170222-0027.html) notions \(such as seeing femicides as a “passionate crime”\), laws that promote gender equality that are not really [incorporated](http://www.americasquarterly.org/node/1930) in the judiciary and a vast number of crimes unprosecuted, that allow a general sense of impunity, are factors that explain the rise in violence against women in Latin America.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.7.3. Con: Some experts claim that the rise in violence is rooted in [cultural](http://www.humanosphere.org/human-rights/2016/01/women-in-latin-american-cities-face-higher-rates-of-sexual-assault-and-the-number-is-growing/) and historical factors: while violence against women before was present but invisible, nowadays it is covered by the media and recognised as a wider problem.
1.1.6.1.3.2.11.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.9.2.
1.1.6.1.3.2.12. Con: There is no evidence that what you wear affects whether you are assaulted or not. As this [exhibition](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/powerful-art-exhibit-powerfully-answers-the-question-what-were-you-wearing_us_59baddd2e4b02da0e1405d2a) explores.
1.1.6.1.3.2.13. Con: Assuming that people who harass or assault women are less likely to target a more conservatively dressed woman, this would not change the number of assaults, but simply change which women are the targets.
1.1.6.1.3.2.14. Con: The restriction on nipple showing is itself unwanted sexual harassment.
1.1.6.1.3.2.14.1. Pro: Restrictions on breastfeeding in public are a form of harassment, because mothers are often shamed and shunned for doing so, which discourages mothers from participating openly in public activities, and encumbers them by requiring that they leave to a private room \(often a filthy bathroom\) or carry additional coverings for the  purpose.
1.1.6.1.3.2.15. Pro: If women are allowed to be topless in public spaces, and people are also allowed to take pictures where those women were included, if it didn't imply a form of harassment, then those pictures could end up online where anyone can use them to cyberbully, discriminate, slander, make fake sex commerce or pornography.
1.1.6.1.3.2.15.1. Con: All of the listed activities assume that toplessness becomes legal without the stigma around it disappearing, it is pretty unclear why this would be the case.
1.1.6.1.3.2.15.2. Pro: If we didn't allow people to take pictures in places where women can be topless, we would need lots of policing and we would lose the freedom to take random pictures/selfies in those public spaces.
1.1.6.1.3.2.16. Con: Women are free to expose almost the entire breast other than the nipple, even if that exposure might lead to unwanted attention. The nipple is the one part of the breast that serves the purpose of infant nutrition and yet that is the part of which we restrict exposure.
1.1.6.1.3.2.17. Con: Women can make their own [choices](https://www.theroot.com/what-well-meaning-men-don-t-understand-when-it-comes-to-1821383175) on self protection in different environments.  They get harassed in current clothing as well but this is not restricted for them.
1.1.6.1.3.2.18. Pro: Scantily clad women tend to be objectified by men.  [Scans confirm.](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090216-bikinis-women-men-objects.html)
1.1.6.1.3.2.18.1. Con: Since the [study](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090216-bikinis-women-men-objects.html) is based on women wearing bikinis, it seems obvious that the problem may not be based on clothes but education as not all men reacted that way.
1.1.6.1.3.2.18.1.1. Con: That doesn't change the fact that there are men who do react that way.
1.1.6.1.3.2.18.1.2. Con: The [study](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090216-bikinis-women-men-objects.html) makes no claims as to why this behavior exists in men, or the efficacy of education in changing it.
1.1.6.1.3.2.18.1.2.1. Pro: Sexual harassment training may have reverse effect, research suggests.  [theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/02/sexual-harassment-training-failing-women)
1.1.6.1.3.2.18.1.2.2. Con: [Researchers](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090216-bikinis-women-men-objects.html) also suggest that the experiment made with women would work as "women usually react to men they desire by interpreting their minds, thinking about what they're interested in, and then trying to please them". Therefore, if women are socialized to not dehumanize men, there is no reason why the opposite could not happen.
1.1.6.1.3.2.18.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.18.1.2.2.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19. Pro: Showing their nipples in public may make women more enticing to sex offenders, thus putting them in danger.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1. Pro: This may also reduce sympathy towards women who are victims as they are seen as complicit in the crime.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.1. Pro: According to an [Amnesty International survey](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/uk-new-poll-finds-third-people-believe-women-who-flirt-partially-responsible-being), 26% of UK-based respondents believed that a woman is partially or totally responsible for being raped if she dresses provocatively.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.1.1. Con: As the source states, this percentage does not reflect that women are actually responsible but the “sexist blame culture” women live in, which politicians and society in general should fight against .
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.1.1.1. Pro: Women rationalise some misconceptions around rape due to internalised sexism and as a coping [mechanism](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/19/blame-the-rapist): some blame victims and believe if they do not do certain things, they will be safe when, actually, that is not often true.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.1.2. Pro: Women are often "[slut-shamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slut-shaming)" for showing their bodies and for acting in a sexually provocative manner.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.1.2.1. Con: The problem does not lie in what women do, but a sexist society that imposes impossible and unfair rules on them. Women are indeed [slut-shamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slut-shaming) if they dress provocatively or are deemed too sexual, yet they are also criticised for being prudish and not sexual enough.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.2. Con: Sexism and patriarchy are responsible for women being not believed, blamed and even humiliated when they are victims of sexual assault. Instead of worrying about victims gaining or losing sympathy, those attitudes are the ones that need changing, not the other way around.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.2. Pro: This could elicit more attention from pedophiles and sexual predators.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.1.1.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4. Con: It should not be the burden of women to protect themselves from sex offenders. This puts the responsibility on women to prevent themselves from being harassed, when the responsibility should be on harassers. It is the same logic that shames women for what they wear.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.1. Con: People are responsible for their own safety. Sex offenders exist, whether we like it or not. Individuals should wear a helmet on a construction site for the same reasons. We do not live in a perfect world, accidents happen and sex offenders exist. This means we need to deal with them the best we can.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.1.1. Con: Even if people are responsible for their own safety, they are so to a certain extent. Therefore, if ensuring safety implies highly expensive, cumbersome, discriminatory or limiting actions, those expectations should be rejected.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.1.1.1. Pro: In most contexts, women do not regularly walk around naked or topless and they are still harassed and [assaulted](http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures). Being covered does not protect them: men not assaulting them is the only way of protection.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.1.1.2. Con: We should wear bullet proof vests all the time if mass shooters were as [common and widespread](http://theconversation.com/how-common-are-sexual-harassment-and-rape-in-the-united-states-67358) as sexual harassment, and if bullet proof vests were as accesible and comfortable as clothes.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.1.2. Con: Telling women to cover up is not dealing with sex offenders, it's dealing with the victims.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.1.3. Con: Around 60% of sexual violence [perpetrators](https://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/rape-sexual-violence/Pages/victims-perpetrators.aspx) are known by their victims: they are partners, relatives, friends or acquaintances. Therefore, sexual violence is generally not the product of sociopathic sex offenders women need to be protected from but from their peers. Hence, it is not victims who ought to change behaviours but perpetrators and society at large who, with their [attitudes](https://sapac.umich.edu/article/196), allow socially-adjusted and non-criminal men to commit these crimes.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.2. Pro: Unwanted harassment occurs regardless of amount of clothing worn.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.3. Pro: As with dress code enforcement in many schools, this is telling women they are responsible for men's reactions to them rather than telling men that they are responsible for their own reactions toward women. This view enables the continuation of a "blame the victim" culture.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.4. Con: Women do need to take responsibility to protect themselves. This in no way absolves an offender, but could help prevent an offense. This same logic is what leads us to lock our doors while we are away, to protect our possessions from criminals.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.5. Pro: If unwanted sexual harassment is an issue them those committing that should be the target of laws and regulations.  Restricting a victim is not the way we normally handle any other form of attackers \(financial, racial, religious\).  We don't tell a Jewish person to not display her symbol because someone may be anti-Semitic and attack her
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.6. Con: Regardless of how things should be, the fact remains that society often holds women responsible for being harassed or assaulted. It is therefore in women's best interest to do whatever it takes to keep themselves safe, which often means encouraging them to cover up.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.6.1. Con: This argument is circular, the justification given for this sexism is nothing more than sexism.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.6.2. Con: It is immoral to hold a victim responsible for the acts of their victimizer. To do so is to both excuse and encourage the acts of the victimizer, and produce a chilling effect where women fear holding their victimizers accountable, or even admit they are victims. The two effects lead to an increase in victimizers and a growing, silent pool of victims.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.6.3. Pro: According to a UK-based poll, over [fifty percent](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8515592.stm) of women polled believe that rape is the female victim's fault. They will also likely believe the same about harassment towards topless women.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.6.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.1.1.1.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.1.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.6.5. Pro: An Australian [survey](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/09/17/drunk-women-blame-rape-according-1-5-australians-survey-finds) similarly showed that 1 in 5 people believe that the woman is at least partly to blame if she gets raped while intoxicated.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.6.5.1. Con: The fact that people believe an intoxicated woman is at least partly to blame is just that a belief. It is neither moral, nor ethical, nor rational, as we do not assign blame to every impaired person who is taken advantage of. This belief is nothing more than [internalized misogyny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalized_sexism#Internalized_misogyny).
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.6.6. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.1.1.1.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.1.1.1.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.8. Pro: The real problem of harassment is that boys/men are socialized toward a dominant, violent and sexually aggressive behavior known as [toxic masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_masculinity), which justifies the violence against women.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.8.1. Pro: By sexualizing women's bodies, the ideal of masculinity justifies harassment by [casting women as sex objects](https://www.thoughtco.com/emma-watsons-speech-were-about-masculinity-3026213) who exist to give pleasure to men.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.8.1.1. Pro: The allowance of female nipple showing will be exploited by the pornographic industry and will further sexualize the music and film industry.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.8.1.2. Con: In[psychoanalysis, sexualization is natural and desexualizing one´s own body or the body of others](http://www.encyclopedia.com/psychology/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/desexualization) is considered neurotic or psychotic depending on the case.
1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.1.2.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20. Pro: [Street harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_harassment#Prevalence) is more commonly directed towards women than men. It would likely increase without restrictions on nipple exposure.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.1. Con: It's not clear that permitting nipple exposure would immediately lead to more nipples being shown on the street.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.1.1. Pro: In countries where such [restriction](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/06/travel/naked-germany/) does not exist, there is not a topless trend: some [women](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-mulhall/is-america-ready-for-topless-sunbathing_b_1827990.html) decide where to go topless in public \(e.g. the beach\) and some women choose [not](http://wtop.com/news/2014/07/beach-trends-survey-where-to-find-nude-sunbathers-speedo-acceptance-up/) to do it at all.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.1.1.1. Pro: In countries with less restrictions, people generally go topless on the beach or resorts, yet not on the street. The city of [Barcelona](http://www.barcelonayellow.com/bcn-beaches/17-beaches-in-barcelona), for example, allows partial nudity on the beach \(and total nudity in some designated beaches\) yet has rules against people going topless on the street for both men and women.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.2. Con: Street harassment has been defined to exclude [visual cues](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/03/040316072953.htm) and only include verbal cues.  Exposed breasts are inherently harassing to men as they are responded to at the animal level, not the cerebral level, and cause unasked  changes in arousal.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.2.1. Con: As it is the case for the legs or the hips, thinking about it in a sexualized way is natural, but acting on it is not. It should be the same for nipples, so it is \(mostly\) men's responsability to act civilized, not for women to control the way they dress.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3. Con: In many European countries \([with Austria, Germany or Spain at the top](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2692949/Getting-naked-Germans-like-nude-holiday-holidaymakers-country-say-Expedia.html)\) women, including mothers and grandmothers with their children, sunbathe topless at the beach and it is not perceived as something sexualised \(that children should be hidden from\) or that increases harassment.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1. Con: Many things are legal in other countries that would not make sense to legalize in the US due to differences in culture and politics. Countries where female nipple exposure is legalized are inherently different from the US, thus nipple restrictions should not be eliminated on that basis.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1. Con: If the US is so different than other countries, it does not make sense that toplessness for women is in fact legal [in 36 states of the US](http://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/nipple-double-standard).
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.1. Con: In these states, women are still only allowed to be topless in a few restricted public locations in comparison to men.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.2. Con: Women are still arrested in these [legal states](http://gotopless.org/topless-laws) under the pretense of 'disorderly conduct', even with top-free laws in place.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.3. Con: In most parts of the North America it's legal for women to be [topless](http://gotopless.org/topless-laws). However, nipples still have to be covered to avoid accusations of public indecency.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.4. Con: Although the law does not prohibit it, an exposed female nipple is still considered lewd by society.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.4.1. Pro: An example of this is the stringent anti-female nipple policy of [Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119/) and [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/21/facebook-nudity-violence-censorship-guidelines).
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.4.1.1. Pro: Instagram has [proven the flaws](http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13852900/genderless-nipples-instagram-censorship-policy) within its own policy as seen in its removal of an image of a perceived female nipple that was revealed to be the nipple of a male. Therefore, this policy should be discontinued.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Female nudity is regarded as an infringement of social media policy [more than hate speech, racism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/11/03/facebook-removed-a-picture-with-a-naked-woman-and-a-man-with-a-racist-sign-guess-why-it-was-censored/?utm_term=.37e23d2937a8),[sexism and violence.](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/feb/19/facebook-images-rape-domestic-violence)

1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.4.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.1.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.4.1.3. Pro: A transgender woman [tested](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/03/facebook-instagram-do-i-have-boobs-now) this policy by posting pictures of her breasts during her transition. Her goal was to find out at what point her breasts were "female enough" to be censored. The results, however, were not conclusive, and illustrated the policy's flaws.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.2. Con: The culture and politics may be different in these countries as a result of more liberal policies. Allowing nipple showing may move the US towards the attitudes of those countries.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.2.1. Con: As of [January 2017](http://www.gallup.com/poll/201152/conservative-liberal-gap-continues-narrow-tuesday.aspx), 36% of Americans think of themselves as conservative while 25% consider themselves liberals. It thus stands to reason that the majority of the nation is not in favor of adopting the attitudes of more liberal countries, so it would be undemocratic to force it upon them.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.2.1.1. Con: In [recent](http://www.gallup.com/poll/201152/conservative-liberal-gap-continues-narrow-tuesday.aspx) years, the percentage of conservatives and especially moderates has been decreasing while the percentage of liberals has been increasing. If this tendency keeps up, it would make sense for the US to adopt more liberal policies.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.3. Con: This is not a matter rooted in the specific culture, politics or history of the US, but an issue that is related to gender stereotypes and discrimination, which have also been prevalent in other countries.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.3.1. Pro: Canada has an [indecent acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indecent_exposure#Canada) law which typifies the exposure of genitals or female nipples for sexual purposes to children under 16. However, other indecent acts are left to be decided by the judges. Since then, jurisprudence has ruled that public nudity “is not sexual or indecent or an offense”.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.3.2. Pro: Former British Colonies including the US had laws regarding [indecent exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indecent_exposure#United_Kingdom). However, the UK, for example, has changed these laws to make them more specific \(referring to genitalia and “with the intent to shock”\) and equally applicable to men and women.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.3.3. Pro: In Argentina, the police were called due to three women sunbathing topless. Up to 20 [officers](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/761730/topless-sunbathers-buenos-aires-argentina-police) arrived at the beach and threatened to arrest them if they did not cover their breasts. Footage of the confrontation went viral and stirred [protests](http://fusion.kinja.com/hundreds-of-women-went-topless-in-argentina-to-demand-e-1793858616) all over the country.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.2.5.1.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.3.4. Pro: In non-Western countries [toplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toplessness) was customary and allowed, yet in most Western cultural traditions it was indecent. However, a large number of countries have modernised public nudity laws or at least allow women to go topless in certain situations or spaces. There is no specific reason why the US could not do the same.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.4. Pro: The sheer size of the US makes it ideologically and politically incomparable to most other countries in the world; therefore one needs to take into account the vast variation in demographics before they could consider applying other nations' laws to the entirety of the US.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.4.1. Con: Even if the US is a very diverse country, ideologically and politically, some [rights](http://Even if the US is a very diverse country, ideologically and politically, basic rights are shared by all states, thus in matters regarding equality and civil rights, the size and differences across the US should not matter.) are shared by all states, thus in matters regarding equality and civil rights, the size and differences across the US should not matter.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.5. Con: [Public opinion](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/) on social issues changes: the perception on same-sex marriage has completely shifted in 15 years, with more people accepting it than opposing it. The US has followed the path of other liberal democracies and has [legalised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage#Same-sex_marriage_around_the_world) same-sex marriage. Women's rights should be no different.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.5.1. Con: This says nothing about how public opinion on social issues change. The example of "changing attitudes on Gay Marriage" occurred before a law change not because of it. This could be held as evidence for changing culture before changing the law.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.5.1.1. Con: As the ‘Free The Nipple’ movement has shown, it is possible that cultural attitudes towards nipples have changed and therefore laws and rules should do so.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.6. Pro: In matters of social policy regarding contentious issues \(e.g. prostitution, drugs or alcohol consumption\), the US has oftentimes adopted a less progressive stance than other countries.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.6.1. Pro: Prostitution is [legal](http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/welcome-to-paradise/) and regulated in Germany and 7 other [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Europe#Austria) countries, while it is overwhelmingly [illegal](http://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000119) in the US with the exception of 11 counties in Nevada.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.6.2. Pro: [Medicinal marijuana](http://www.highsnobiety.com/2017/02/17/germany-marijuana-laws/) is legal throughout Germany—a country that often [embraces](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/article31105532.html) public nudity—while its legality in the US [varies](http://www.governing.com/gov-data/state-marijuana-laws-map-medical-recreational.html) on a state-by-state basis.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.6.2.1. Con: Germany's culture of nudity and body expression, [Freikörperkultur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freikörperkultur), is uniquely German.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.6.3. Con: While other countries, may be more liberal on some issues, the same can be said for the US in other areas.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.6.3.1. Pro: For example, some [states](http://www.familiesthrusurrogacy.com/surrogacy-by-country/) in the US allow commercial surrogacy, which is forbidden in Canada, Australia and most of Europe. Citizens from these countries also go to the US to use fertility treatments which allow them to choose the [sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_selection#Legality) of their babies, something also illegal in their home countries.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.6.3.2. Pro: A direct counter-example is Marijuana legalisation, where parts of the US are considerably more progressive than otherwise similar western countries.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.6.3.2.1. Pro: Germany, for example, [bans cannabis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_in_Germany) for recreational use and legalized same-sex marriage only in 2017.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.6.4. Pro: While some countries have adopted stricter [gun control laws](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/15/so-america-this-is-how-you-do-gun-control) after mass shootings, the US has been less progressive after similar violent acts.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.7. Pro: The US is still predominantly operating under Puritan [values](https://psmag.com/puritan-values-still-resonate-in-today-s-usa-1abdb0c0505a#.oscfceszb), where showing nipples is considered grossly inappropriate.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.7.1. Con: The sexualisation and [objectification](http://womenandadvertising.weebly.com/women-as-sexual-objects.html) of women’s bodies is acceptable in [advertising](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814039688) to increase sales. It is hypocritical to use women’s bodies for capitalist values while restricting women's freedom to expose themselves due to Puritan values.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.7.2. Pro: Unlike Europe, where religious currents were more diverse and the aristocracy and lower classes had more [liberties](http://www.primitivism.com/nudity.htm) regarding morality, the [Puritans](http://peopleof.oureverydaylife.com/devil-satan-puritan-beliefs-2619.html) \(a scission from the Church of England that settled in America\) took the scriptures more literally, resulting in a prudish mentality across the whole society.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.4. Con: As breasts become less sexualised, street harassment may decrease overall.
1.1.6.1.3.2.20.5. Pro: Nipple-showing provides justification for street harassment. Women who choose to show their nipples may be told they are 'asking for it'.

1.1.6.1.3.2.20.5.3. Con: This puts the responsibility on women to prevent themselves from being harassed, when the responsibility should be on harassers not to bother women in the first place.

1.1.6.2. Pro: Women's bodies are constantly policed and shamed for how they look. This should not be extended by banning the showing of body parts solely on the basis of gender.

1.1.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.1.2.
1.1.6.5. Pro: Women are often shamed for breastfeeding in public, and thus restricted in where they can comfortably nurse their baby. Liberating attitudes towards nipple showing would reduce this stigma and inconvenience.
1.1.6.5.1. Pro: Not being able to eat when hungry can cause unnecessary stress for a baby.
1.1.6.5.1.1. Pro: If underfed, babies can develop a variety of health [conditions](https://fedisbest.org/2016/09/the-scientific-evidence-on-the-effects-on-accidental-starvation-on-the-newborn-brain/) that can lead to brain injury.
1.1.6.5.1.1.1. Con: An organization that spreads exaggerated fear of starvation and underfeeding in breastfeeding babies should probably not be used as an objective resource on infant feeding. [parentingpatch.com](https://parentingpatch.com/problem-fed-best/) [thousanddays.org](https://thousanddays.org/organizations-call-for-constructive-dialogue-on-infant-feeding/)
1.1.6.5.1.2. Con: Mothers can allay this concern by feeding their babies formula instead of breast milk.
1.1.6.5.1.2.1. Con: Mothers are often judged and scolded for feeding babies formula in place of breastfeeding.
1.1.6.5.1.2.2. Con: Many women may want to breastfeed and should not feel they have to switch to formula to feed a hungry baby because society feels uncomfortable about it.
1.1.6.5.1.2.2.1. Pro: There are many health [benefits](https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-breastfeeding-benefits-you-and-your-baby_8910.bc) to breastfeeding that are not as available with formula.
1.1.6.5.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: The [American Academy of Pediatrics](http://www.webmd.com/baby/breastfeeding-vs-formula-feeding#1) recommends moms breastfeed their infants because it is easier to digest and provides complete nutrition.
1.1.6.5.1.2.2.1.2. Pro: Breastfeeding has been linked with a lower risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \([SIDS](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-breastfeeding-sids-idUSTRE75C2V220110613)\).
1.1.6.5.1.2.2.1.3. Pro: Breastfeeding has been shown to [reduce](https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-breastfeeding-benefits-you-and-your-baby_8910.bc?page=3#articlesection6) incidences of [post-partum depression](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007215.htm), which is the moderate to severe depression a woman can experience after giving birth.
1.1.6.5.1.2.2.1.4. Con: Mothers are still able to pump milk and bottle feed before going into public. This eliminates exposing their nipples while still providing nutrients.
1.1.6.5.1.2.3. Pro: Formula is often more convenient to give a baby when out in public.
1.1.6.5.1.2.3.1. Pro: A woman would not have to go through the process of trying to unclothe her nipple. Thus, this is a more comfortable option while in public.
1.1.6.5.1.2.3.1.1. Con: It is a more comfortable option for displeased onlookers, yet it is not more comfortable for the woman per se and definitely not more comfortable for the baby.
1.1.6.5.1.2.3.2. Con: Formula is not in any way more convenient when out in public. Remembering to bring the bottle, the formula, the water and a way to measure the ingredients as well as a way to wash each item while out or when returning home can not reasonably be considered easier than uncovering a breast.  Changes in plans are even harder to accomodate.
1.1.6.5.1.2.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.2.2.1.
1.1.6.5.1.2.3.4. Con: Formula is also more expensive than breastfeeding and may not be a viable solution for mothers who struggle financially.
1.1.6.5.2. Pro: In some situations, it is not feasible for a woman to relocate in order to breastfeed.
1.1.6.5.2.1. Pro: Mothers are often forced to breastfeed in unsanitary conditions, like public bathroom stalls because they face ridicule or harassment otherwise.
1.1.6.5.2.1.1. Con: There are [apps](http://www.parenting.com/news-break/new-app-shows-moms-best-places-breastfeeding) that show moms clean, quiet and safe places to breastfeed, where they will not face negative feedback.
1.1.6.5.2.1.1.1. Con: The majority of smartphone owners [reside](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/chapter-one-a-portrait-of-smartphone-ownership/) in urban areas, which means that these apps aren't as likely to provide safe breastfeeding environments for rural or suburban women.
1.1.6.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con: As these apps grow in popularity, they are likely to incorporate a wider area of reach to include more suburban areas.
1.1.6.5.2.1.1.1.2. Con: There is likely to be more quiet and safe areas for women to breastfeed in less populated areas, in comparison to urban areas.
1.1.6.5.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con: The conservative population is most highly concentrated in [rural](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/01/upshot/many-ways-to-map-election-results.html) areas, therefore these places could actually be less safe for breastfeeding women since conservatives tend to be less in favor of supporting female nipple exposure than liberals are.
1.1.6.5.2.1.1.2. Con: This solves just a part of the issue without addressing the structural problem, that is the negative attitude of society towards something as natural as breastfeeding.
1.1.6.5.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Using the "[solutionist technology](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/09/evgeny-morozov-technology-solutionism-interview)" for problem-solving rather than radically changing a problem is a conservative approach that seeks to preserve the current system instead of reforming it, shifting the social responsibility to the individual.
1.1.6.5.2.1.1.3. Con: Many [women](https://nwlc.org/issue/data-on-poverty-income/) might not be able to afford a smartphone. Therefore having an app and a safe place to breastfeed becomes a privilege allowed only to some.
1.1.6.5.3. Pro: Sometimes women are discriminated [against](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/amber-hinds/breastfeeding-in-public_b_3095644.html) when they breastfeed.
1.1.6.5.4. Pro: -> See discussion #16093: Breastfeeding should be mandatory
1.1.6.5.5. Pro: Breastfeeding is a natural human function, so there should be no restriction to it.
1.1.6.5.5.1. Pro: Breasts exist on women for the purpose of breastfeeding.
1.1.6.5.5.1.1. Con: Prior to breastfeeding, the female needs to attract a partner, thats why breasts grow in adolescence even before gestation, making it another main function of them.
1.1.6.5.5.1.1.1. Con: Male body hair also develops in adolescence before procreation,  but that does not mean that their main function is to attract a mate.
1.1.6.5.5.1.1.1.1. Con: There is a [relation](http://www.rebelcircus.com/blog/science-behind-women-attracted-hairy-men/) between male body hair and sexual attraction, body hair retains pheromones which amplifies its biological effect.
1.1.6.5.5.1.2. Pro: The nipple is biologically meant for feeding. A newborn child is not a partner, but heavily relies on the 'nude' nipple.
1.1.6.5.5.1.2.1. Con: That only supports that breastfeeding is one of the functions of breasts, not necessarely the only one.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3. Con: Nipple stimulation induces the release of oxytocin which is [involved](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin) in sexual arousal and bonding, making them sexual organs; and they are also one of the tissues most rich in meissner corpuscles that [respond](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_corpuscle) to soft touch, just like mucose the tissue of genitals, which makes them erogenous zones.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.1. Con: While stimulation does naturally lead to the expression of sexual hormones, the sole exposure does not necessarily do that. Arousement of others due to 'erotic' body parts is grounded on a society's beliefs. For instance, in some asian cultures feet are considered arousing.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.1.1. Con: Eroticization of objects and body parts is called [sexual fetishism and most of the time is a natural, non paraphilic and non pathological mechanism of sexual excitement and arousal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_fetishism).
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.1.2. Con: [Erect nipples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple_stimulation) can be a prominent indicator of a female's sexual arousal, and the female's sexual partner may, as a result, find this erotically stimulating.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.1.2.1. Con: The exact same thing can be said of a man's nipples.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.1.3. Con: In societies where feet are massively considered arousing, it would be reasonable to ask for discretion of their display in public, or in contexts where such censorship didn´t imply a major difference for comfort or function to the person, rather to expect everyone to ignore their own bio/psycho/social response.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.1.3.1. Con: It would be reasonable to ask for discretion of display of feet in public, but it would not be reasonable to ask for discretion of display of only women's feet in public.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.1.3.2. Con: It is no more reasonable to ban the showing of part of the body then it is to ban a word, and the idea of banning even the most heinous of words is repulsive.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.2. Con: The release of oxytocin from nipple stimulation is [intended](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK148970/) to facilitate flow to breastmilk from the milk glands to the nipple, and to increase the bond between mother and baby: it is not for sexual arousal.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.3. Con: Oxytocin is involved in a myriad of [physiological](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453013002369) [processes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3858648/), only one of which is sexual, and the function of oxytocin in sexual arousal is [unclear](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763405801769). Therefore the release of oxytocin cannot be equated with sexual arousal. With that logic, childbirth and breastfeeding would be sexual to women.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.4. Con: The tissues most rich in meissner corpuscles are the fingertips and lips. Although lips could be considered an erogenous zone, this is not a reason for them to be censored.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.4.1. Con: The location and daily use of lips makes the possibility of their censorship too troublesome \([except under rigorous islamic culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_hijab)\) to be compared to the censorship of nipples.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.5. Pro: [Nipple stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple_stimulation) is also a common sexual practice and is most of the time followed by sex or genital contact, which can't be said of kissing or caressing the neck/feet/bellybutton/earlobes which can be considered acceptable forms of [public display of affection.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_intimacy)
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.5.1. Con: Neck stimulation is also a common sexual practice.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.5.2. Con: Stimulation of [male nipples](https://www.livescience.com/15380-nipples-genitals-brain-map.html) activate the exact same parts of the brain as stimulation of female nipples, making them just as much \(or just as little\) a sexual organ.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.6. Pro: Stimulation of the nipples creates a [similar neurological response](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201305/sexual-wiring-womens-breasts) to vaginal stimulation.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.6.1. Con: For some people, stimulation of the earlobes, neck and feet creates the [same response](https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/7-awesome-erogenous-zones#1). That is not a reason to ban them from public display.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.5.
1.1.6.5.5.1.3.6.3. Pro: Some women could also have an [orgasm](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201305/sexual-wiring-womens-breasts) with only breast stimulation while that is not true for men.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4. Con: The development of conspicuous breasts with a characteristic shape seems to also be [a way of sexual signaling.](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Why-Do-Women-Have-Breasts-46783.shtml)
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1. Con: If this theory was correct, breasts should be sexualised in all cultures and time periods.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.1. Con: For [many](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_clothing_and_textiles) time periods/cultures it was/is difficult to fabricate clothes, it is uncomfortable to wear them in hot weather and male armour was/is a priority, so not covering female breasts is biased for convenience in those cultures.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.1.1. Pro: Clothes have most of the time been made by hand using raw natural materials which is effortful and requires resources as animals or plants; that combined with hot environments and the male-centrism of most cultures it could explain the low priority given to female clothes.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con: Listing male centrism as an equal cause of this is absurd as many of the tribes referred to were [matriarchal](https://face2faceafrica.com/article/top-7-african-tribes-women-literally-rule) societies that often had/have more than sufficient materials and manpower to produce such clothing, and still chose not to.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.1.2. Con: It also wasn't a priority because there is no good reason to do it. Which is why they had no problem not doing it.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2. Con: The roundness and exuberance [depicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_figurines) in many prehistoric sculptures of the female body shape, usually enlarge the size of breasts either as a sign of beauty or as a fertility symbol, which shows the psychological importance that breasts have had in human beings even in the paleolithic era.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1. Con: The importance of breasts in prehistoric cultures has nothing to do with categorising them as sexual organs. The classification of a sex organ must be done biologically, not historically, to avoid bias and preconceptions.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2. Con: Female breasts evolved as a feature of only upright primates such as the [Gelada Baboon](https://www.google.com.co/search?biw=1280&bih=706&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=w4f3WaSyM4LfmwG5wITIAw&q=gelada+baboon+breasts&oq=gelada+baboon+breasts&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1480.2181.0.2357.8.6.0.0.0.0.240.431.0j1j1.2.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..6.0.0....0.dj7dZZOtwNM), becoming more visible to other individuals; which indicates those features are analogous to the red butts of horizonally oriented Baboons and other horizontally oriented primates in the [purpose](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-dawn/201004/why-do-breasts-mesmerize) of attracting mates by displaying simmetry, fertility, youth and thus sexual desirability.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.1. Con: The feathers of the male peacock also [evolved](https://www.livescience.com/5066-peacocks-colorful-tails.html) for the purpose of attracting mates. Evolution of attributes seen as attractive by the other gender does not automatically make that attribute sexual.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Attributes that evolved to attract the opposite sex play a major role in the mating process, thereby they can be called sexual features.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con: There are endless other aspects of a human body/behavior that are intended to attract the opposite sex, these are not banned.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Dancing can be considered part of the human mating ritual, and some dances are [censored in some contexts.](http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/09/19/watch-forbidden-dances-banned-moves-from-the-tango-to-twerking/).
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con: As the story points out, that context is always changing, one might as well use banned books to make a point as banned dance moves, in either case, history has proven that the argument is invalid, and won't withstand the test of time.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Some body parts and human behaviours are banned and others are not, because the ones banned are considered more "[sexually suggestive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_suggestiveness)" and explicit than others.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: [Human mating strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mating_strategies) overlap with reproductive strategies for the innate desire to produce quality offspring. Signaling attraction is one of the first steps.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.2. Con: If "sexual" refers only to reproduction, then unclothed buttocks shouldn't be censored either, the censorship seems to cover the most [sexually suggestive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_suggestiveness) attributes, which could be argued includes male chest, body hair and/or nipples.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.1. Con: Men have nipples, the exact same nipples women have.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.2. Con: There is no good reason why buttocks should be censored.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.3. Con: Thongs, which prominently display the buttocks, are generally not illegal.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: «Even though men's interest in breasts may increase where women are clothed, the interpretation that men in nude cultures do not find breasts erotic is erroneous. Based on numerous interviews I conducted with the Hadza, men find breasts erotic, even though women usually do not cover their breasts» – [Marlowe, Frank. 1998. The nubility hypothesis](http://Not necessarily. «Even though men's interest in breasts may increase where women are clothed, the interpretation that men in nude cultures do not find breasts erotic is erroneous. Based on numerous interviews I conducted with the Hadza, men find breasts erotic, even though women usually do not cover their breasts» – Marlowe, F. 1998. The nubility hypothesis: The human breast as an honest signal of residual reproductive value.): The human breast as an honest signal of residual reproductive value.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.2.1. Con: The fact that men find breasts to be erotic does not classify them as sexual organs, and thus is not a reason to censor them.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.2.1.1. Pro: Breasts and nipples are not main sexual organs as they play no direct or necessary role in sexual intercourse. Their primary biological function is non-sexual, namely the nursing of young offspring.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.5.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.2.1.3. Con: [Studies on eye tracking prove women have the same rate of fixation on female breasts](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scientists-say-women-stare-at-other-womens-chests-as-much-as-men/), and also a lot of them report the [desire or past behaviour of sleeping with other women](https://www.autostraddle.com/100-of-women-attracted-to-other-women-study-says-315211/), which shows that breasts can be sexually "objectified" by women also.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.2.1.3.1. Con: If we compare the acts of staring at a women's chest, and saying women's bodies must always be concealed because something something sex, it is pretty clear the latter is much more intrusive then the former.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.3. Pro: In some [indigenous communities in Africa](https://digitalubuntu.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/is-it-time-for-a-nipple-revolution/), for example, women walk around bare-chested and their breasts are not sexualized.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.3.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.2.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.4. Pro: A [study](http://www.livescience.com/23500-why-men-love-breasts.html) of 191 cultures found that breasts were only considered sexually important to men in 13 of the cultures.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.5. Pro: Cultural anthropologists found that men in Mali were “bemused or horrified” at the perspective of sexual foreplay involving [breasts](http://www.livescience.com/23500-why-men-love-breasts.html).
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2. Pro: Curves are an [appealing](https://amp.livescience.com/9834-hourglass-figures-affect-men-brains-drug.html) shape to male brains \(maybe [even to female brains too](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11977121/Women-are-either-bisexual-or-gay-but-never-straight.html)\), as shown in how we prefer [curvy](http://psyche-matters.net/2017/08/13/how-cars-are-so-damn-sexy-prof-jordan-peterson/) [cars](https://www.google.com.co/amp/s/amp.livescience.com/9859-love-curvaceous-cars.html), curvy calligraphy \(flourishes\), curvy architecture, curvy art... which supports the sexual role of round buttocks and round breasts promoted by the stimulus of estrogen in women.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.1. Pro: Women are not the primary target of the curvacious anatomy attraction strategy because they have [lower testosterone levels and thus lower sex drives,](https://www.google.com.co/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/200904/the-testosterone-curse-part-1%3famp) which explains why they believe curves are 'cute' but not as sexy or arousing as they are to men.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2. Con: The female body is not a material object analogous to the curves of a car.  Therefore it doesn't matter if males appreciate the curves. The argument would follow that non-curvy women can free the nipple.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.1. Pro: Autonomous agents cannot be viewed in the same way as material objects.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.1.1. Con: If being attracted to some body parts is interpreted as objectification, [it is done mostly involuntarily and naturally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido) and some discretion in regards to the display of those body parts would help prevent that.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.1.1.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.2. Con: The sexual role of female nipples is only one of the aspects for them being covered, the other is their category of vulnerable exocrine glands.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.2.1. Con: If people choose to risk their safety by exposing vulnerable parts of their body, there isn't a compelling government interest to stop them.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.2.2. Con: Our skin is covered with vulnerable exocrine glands in the form of sweat pores.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.2.2.1. Con: We cover most of our skin as nudity is legally seen as indecent, and we are socially required to use tissues and towels when sweating.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.1.1.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.4. Con: It would be too difficult and offensive to determine which women are non curvy.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.4.1. Con: If it is too difficult or offensive to determine which women are 'too curvy' to expose their nipples, the default should be everyone is able to show their nipples.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.5. Con: Bodies are comparable to curvy objects in the property of shape, and [some shapes happen to be sexually attractive](https://www.google.com.co/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/201207/which-body-shapes-are-most-sexually-attractive%3famp).
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.5.1. Con: The purpose of cars, regardless of their attractiveness, is to transport. In a similar manner, breast, even if attractive, have a main purpose which is to breastfeed infants.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.5.2. Con: The attractiveness is irrelevant. In the same manner that taking a car that we find appealing is a crime, touching a breast because it is attractive is a crime. The fact that both are attractive to third parties does not mean they need to be hidden or that legislation about them needs to be different.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.5.3. Pro: Sexually suggestive objects and images [can be](https://www.thelocal.fr/20171003/louvre-museum-says-non-merci-to-sexually-explicit-sculpture) and [tend to be](http://www.closinglogos.com/page/Unsuitable+Logos) banned from public display.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.5.3.1. Con: The fact that something is banned does not mean that it should be, that is circular logic.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.5.3.2. Con: Many nude displays, like the statue of David, and Birth of Venus, as well as many public works, are known to all, taught in schools, and displayed in child friendly parks and museums, so even if sexually suggestive objects and images may be censored, this can't really be extended to nudity.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.5.3.3. Con: Although many people may have a nudity fetish, there is nothing inherently sexual about nudity.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.6. Con: The way to reduce female objectification is increasing the importance of the female mind and voice in society, not ignoring the erotic potential of the feminine figure by normalizing women´s toplessness.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.6.1. Con: Reducing female objectification is not only done by increasing women’s voices and minds but by doing so while respecting them as sexual beings. Otherwise, women are put in a disjunctive where being attractive and heard is impossible, which does not further equality.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.7. Con: To some people, the representation of the human figure on material objects[is on itself arousing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agalmatophilia).
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.3. Pro: The same article mentions that the female must be continuously sexually receptive in humans, so the male won't search for other females while she is not in estrus.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.4. Pro: [Other species of primates](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Why-Do-Women-Have-Breasts-46783.shtml) ensure an abundant milk supply for their offspring without growing breasts. This means that breasts have other functions beyond breastfeeding, like sexual signaling.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.4.1. Con: Female [bonobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo#Description), one of our closest relatives, have breasts.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.4.2. Pro: [It is argued](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/may/14/breast-size-evolution) that features such as permanent breasts are unique to female humans, due to selective sexual pressures over evolutionary time.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.5. Con: Even if the particular shape of human female breasts leads to their sexualisation \(due to a combination of biological and societal factors\), their main function, as in any other mammal, is still breastfeeding.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.5.1. Pro: The anatomical purpose of female breasts is to deliver milk to the nursing infant. An individual's arousal at a particular anatomical structure does not make it a sex organ.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.5.1.1. Con: Inidividual's arousal doesn't, but due to the fact that vast majority see it as such could.
1.1.6.5.5.1.4.5.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.1.
1.1.6.5.5.1.5. Pro: Although both men and women have [milk ducts](https://www.babycenter.com/404_can-men-breastfeed_8824.bc), only women's are developed enough to produce milk substantial enough for breastfeeding a baby.
1.1.6.5.5.1.5.1. Con: Men can produce milk, and can breastfeed babies. [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/feb/14/transgender-woman-breastfeed-health)
1.1.6.5.5.2. Pro: When nipple showing is unusual, women are often shamed or stared at for breastfeeding in public.
1.1.6.5.5.2.1. Pro: Some women choose [not to breastfeed](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2760234/Breastfeeding-public-frowned-Mothers-feel-marginalised-ashamed-study-finds.html) altogether simply because they are made to feel marginalized or ashamed in public, even when their first choice is to breastfeed.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2. Con: There will always be people who disapprove of women showing nipples in public, therefore shaming or being stared at will continue regardless of its normalcy.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1. Pro: Is natural and healthy to consider anything related to the sex act as disgusting and shameful, as [it is driven by necessary but unconscious, selfish, primitive, hungry and even deadly parts of our brains \(the reptilian brain\)](http://www.feedtherightwolf.org/2010/11/triggers-of-reptilian-brain/) which most of the time our pro-social mammalian brains/drives and our reasoning human brains/drives have to suppress; thus any body positive trend is actually a neurotic fantasy trying to deny or repress either of those drives.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.2. Pro: We are [all naturally driven by our reptilian brains/´basic instincts´, but we prefer not to trigger those drives](https://myshrink.com/the-reptilian-brain-and-therapy/#tab-con-1) in most social contexts as a way to protect our mental health and focus other parts of our nervous systems.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.8.1.2.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.4. Con: Breasts are not about sex.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.1.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.4.3. Con: Yet almost all women have distinctive [fatty tissue](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0162309587900276) in their breasts which is directly related to their sexual hormones, making it psychologically [desirable](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-dawn/201004/why-do-breasts-mesmerize) to men and being an [honest signal of reproductive value](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26197484); men don't have the same amount, type or shape of such fatty tissue.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.4.3.1. Con: All men, just like all women, have both glandular and fatty tissue in their breasts, and variation of amount exists in both genders.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.2. Con: What people deem ‘normal’ changes over time. Even if some people still disapprove, a wider acceptance of women showing their nipples will still be beneficial.
1.1.6.5.5.2.2.3. Con: Interracial couples were also stared at \(and even [prohibited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage) in the US\) yet society’s perception has changed.
1.1.6.5.5.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.2.1.
1.1.6.5.5.3. Con: Just because something is a natural human function does not mean that it should be done in public. [Defecation](http://police.sanfranciscocode.org/2/153/), [urination](http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/sex-crimes/public-urination-law-penalty.htm), and [fornication](https://www.justia.com/criminal/offenses/sex-crimes/public-indecency/) are all examples of natural acts that are restricted in public areas. Breastfeeding is no different.
1.1.6.5.5.3.1. Con: There are no social, cultural or medical similarities between breastfeeding and defecating, urinating, masturbation or having sex in public. These things cannot be compared.
1.1.6.5.5.3.1.1. Pro: [In all first world countries,](http://theleakyboob.com/2012/01/exploring-the-body-fluids-debate-about-breastfeeding-in-public/) human feces are recognized as a very serious health hazard that can contaminate water and food sources.
1.1.6.5.5.3.1.2. Pro: [Urine](http://theleakyboob.com/2012/01/exploring-the-body-fluids-debate-about-breastfeeding-in-public/) is known to carry pathogens and possible disease and can contaminate water and food sources as it is a human waste product. That is why urinating in public is forbidden.
1.1.6.5.5.3.1.3. Pro: [Masturbation and sex](http://theleakyboob.com/2012/01/exploring-the-body-fluids-debate-about-breastfeeding-in-public/) are not acceptable public acts in most cultures and public display of them is considered sexual deviancy and is punishable by law.
1.1.6.5.5.3.1.4. Pro: Breastfeeding a human infant is encouraged by [recognized health organizations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3380749/) globally.
1.1.6.5.5.3.1.5. Con: These things are medically similar in that they are all biological functions that the human body is designed to perform; therefore they can be compared.
1.1.6.5.5.3.1.5.1. Con: Unlike human milk, which is a rich feeding product segregated by the body, defecation and urination are the ways in which the body disposes the residues \(unhealthy by-products\). Similarly, fornication involves the exchange of fluids that can also carry diseases. Therefore, those processes are not medically comparable.
1.1.6.5.5.3.1.6. Con: An explanation on why prehistoric humans, unlike other mammals, had sex in private is that they sought [concealment](https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/1567/why-do-humans-have-sex-in-private) in situations \(sleeping, eating, defecating or having sex\) that could prevent them from a rapid self-defence. From that perspective, breastfeeding can be comparable.
1.1.6.5.5.3.1.6.1. Con: A sense of [shame](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1930.tb00584.x/abstract) developed as a response to the need of protection, especially as civilisation increased. Therefore other activities such eating or sleeping did not need concealment and were eventually not private. Breastfeeding could be equated to those activities. Ordinary sex is the only instance in which all [cultures](https://psmag.com/social-justice/human-cultures-unlike-many-mammalian-species-evolved-value-sexual-privacy-68104) have kept seeking privacy.
1.1.6.5.5.3.1.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.
1.1.6.5.5.3.2. Con: Breastfeeding is not a sex act, but rather an act of nourishment and comfort for a child.
1.1.6.5.5.3.3. Con: Breastfeeding, the form in which infants are fed, could be compared to eating, and eating in public is not censored.
1.1.6.5.5.3.3.1. Con: Public eating is not censored because it does not include exposing one's breasts. Thus, breastfeeding cannot be effectively compared to eating in public.
1.1.6.5.5.3.3.2. Con: Eating in public places that are not specifically designated for food consumption is actually considered [offensive](http://www.businessinsider.com/american-customs-that-are-offensive-abroad-2015-8) in some countries, such as Japan and Rwanda.
1.1.6.5.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.1.2.2.1.
1.1.6.5.5.5. Pro: Many countries have made legal allowances to protect the right to breastfeed in public.
1.1.6.5.5.5.1. Pro: In the UK, the right to breastfeed in public is protected by [law](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/breastfeeding-in-public.aspx).
1.1.6.5.5.5.2. Pro: The [Australian Human Rights Commission](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/quick-guide/11991) has confirmed the right to breastfeed in public.
1.1.6.5.5.5.2.1. Pro: After a controversy regarding a member of the Parliament who could not combine her breastfeeding schedule with Parliamentary duties, Australia’s lower house, as well as the Senate, now allow [breastfeeding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/10/this-australian-politician-made-history-by-breastfeeding-in-parliament/?utm_term=.dad7ac46be0c) on the floor. Senator Larissa Waters was depicted in headlines worldwide when she used the new rule for the first time and breastfed her baby while on the floor.
1.1.6.5.5.5.3. Pro: In the Philippines, breastfeeding in public is allowed, and breastfeeding mothers are protected by the [Expanded Breastfeeding Promotion Act](http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2010/ra_10028_2010.html).
1.1.6.5.5.5.4. Pro: Pope Francis has repeatedly encouraged breastfeeding in public, and encouraged mothers to breastfeed during a [ceremony](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/09/go-ahead-and-breastfeed-pope-francis-tells-mothers-in-sistine-chapel/?utm_term=.b275eb9762b9) in the Sistine chapel.
1.1.6.5.5.5.5. Pro: In the US, [forty-nine states](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/breastfeeding-state-laws.aspx) have laws that allow mothers to breastfeed in any public or private location. To show that there should be no shame around this, women who breastfeed are exempt from public indecency laws .
1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1. Con: While these laws are in place, there are still reports of law enforcement shaming breast-feeding [mothers](https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/11/29/report-dc-police-officer-shamed-breastfeeding-mother-public/), or asking them to relocate from public locations.
1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1.1. Pro: It is possible that indecency laws actually encourage this behaviour as they suggest that female nipples are indecent and sexual.
1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1.1.1. Pro: These unique restrictions create unnecessary hype around nipples and sexuality.
1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1.1.2. Pro: It is precisely because they're hidden that female nipples are eroticized and considered indecent. The best way to counter this belief is to de-sexualize nipples by allowing them to become more visible in daily life.
1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1.1.2.1. Con: The changing of a law does not necessarily mean a change in the culture. The countries where nipple exposure is not seen as sexual could be the result of the cultural view rather than the legal perspective. In the US female nipple exposure is generally seen as sexual by the culture. And therefore, a law change could allow further sexualisation of the female nipple further into public life.
1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1.1.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.8.1.2.
1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1.1.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.6.
1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1.1.2.4. Con: Women's legs and belly didn't cease to be sexually appealing for men after increasing of sexual liberation which led to their exposure.
1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1.1.2.5. Con: The necessity to show nipples all the time implies that women should be mandated to go topless, even if they would choose not to expose themselves.
1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1.1.2.5.1. Con: Men do not show their nipples all the time, yet men's nipples are not considered extremely sexual and they have the freedom to go topless in many circumstances.
1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1.1.2.5.2. Con: The freedom to do something is not in any case an obligation. The fact that women can show their nipples when they deem necessary, and that that contributes to their desexualisation, does not mean they must show them all the time.
1.1.6.5.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.5.5.
1.1.6.5.7. Con: Mothers can use nursing covers to breastfeed their baby in public, which stops their nipples from being exposed.
1.1.6.5.7.1. Con: The fact that they can use a nursing cover does not mean they should be forced to.
1.1.6.5.7.2. Con: Some babies will not nurse with a nursing cover. Keeping their breasts exposed are sometimes the only way mothers can nurse effectively.
1.1.6.5.8. Con: Breastfeeding is a private act and should be kept as such.
1.1.6.5.8.1. Con: The sexualization of nipples is socially constructed. There is nothing inherently indecent about exposing them.
1.1.6.5.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.1.2.
1.1.6.5.8.1.2. Pro: Viewing women's nudity as something indecent is not a universal perception.
1.1.6.5.8.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.3.
1.1.6.5.8.1.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.4.
1.1.6.5.8.1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.5.
1.1.6.5.8.1.2.4. Pro: The acceptance of nipples showing as fashionable for women changes across time and society.
1.1.6.5.8.1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.2.
1.1.6.5.8.1.2.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.3.
1.1.6.5.8.1.2.4.3. Pro: In the [Tudor](http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/content/McShane_Revealing_Mary_History_Today.pdf) era, it was fashionable for ladies of higher class to show one or both breasts, both at court as well as on portraits.
1.1.6.5.8.1.2.4.3.1. Pro: The French ambassador wrote about how [upset](https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/08/how-royal-nipples-upset-frenchman) he was at Elizabeth I's low cleavage, which exposed her whole breast.
1.1.6.5.8.1.2.4.3.2. Con: However, that trend was inherently sexual, as it was a way to “[titillate](http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/content/McShane_Revealing_Mary_History_Today.pdf) the public”.
1.1.6.5.8.1.2.4.3.2.1. Con: While it was court fashion, it was also a way to express one's maiden status and, when depicted in images, to portray a woman as motherly. \([p. 44](http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/content/McShane_Revealing_Mary_History_Today.pdf)\)
1.1.6.5.8.1.2.4.4. Pro: It was customary for Korean women with children to wear a [breast-exposing Hanbok or breast-exposing Jeogori](https://fromfukuoka.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/breast-exposing-hanbok-or-breast-exposing-ejogori-2/) in public, without feeling shamed.
1.1.6.5.8.1.3. Pro: According to Foucault, sexuality is just [a social construct for maintaining social control.](http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/histofsex/summary.html)
1.1.6.5.8.1.3.1. Con: There are at least two meanings to "sexuality". Foucault was [talking about identity](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/03/04/sexuality_as_social_construct_foucault_is_misunderstood_by_conservatives.html) whereas its other meaning is [the capacity for sexual feelings](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sexuality). "Indecency" is a cultural invention but it is founded on and justified by naturally arising sexuality.
1.1.6.5.8.1.3.2. Pro: [Foucault argued](http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/histofsex/summary.html) that when sex and sexuality become an object of knowledge, the people who control this knowledge become increasingly important as they have an influence on behaviors.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4. Con: Women's nipples are erogenous zones, on par with the clitoris and vagina. It is thus sensible to censor them the same way we do these body parts.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.6.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.2. Con: Men have a relatively [higher concentration of nerve endings](https://www.shape.com/lifestyle/sex-and-love/8-new-ways-touch-your-guy-during-sex) in the soles of their feet than women do," says Mark Michaels, coauthor of Partners in Passion: A Guide to Great Sex, Emotional Intimacy, and Long-Term Love. " By this logic, it is sensible to censor men's feet.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3. Con: The [male nipple](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/columns/straight-dope/article/13045218/why-are-women-expected-to-keep-their-nipples-covered-breasts) is also an [erogenous zone](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27091187), therefore it is unfair that only women should cover their nipples when men's nipples are also sexual.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1. Con: Denouncing the double standard doesn't necessarily imply that women should have the right to show nipple. It equally implies that men should not have such a right. The double standard is resolvable without exposure.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2. Pro: Shirtless men are distracting in public too, so perhaps they should also be required to cover up.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2.1. Con: Shirts \(and other clothes\) can be hazardous, increasing the risk of heat related illnesses like [heat](http://www.livestrong.com/article/522110-the-best-clothing-to-wear-to-prevent-heat-exhaustion/) [stoke](https://www.healthyhorns.utexas.edu/HT/HT_heatstroke.html) \(neither source talks about this directly, but it's something to watch, and removing clothes is a good treatment, better sources welcome\)
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2.2. Pro: In most industrialized modern societies, both genders being fully clothed in public is reinforced as socially appropriate. Showing nipple would thus go against majority society.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2.2.1. Con: It's every person's right to decide whether he/she would find exposing body parts, male or female to be inappropriate. No one should enforce a law on someone's personal belief or feeling. If a woman would like to go topless, it's her own business and shouldn't be a matter of law.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2.2.1.1. Con: A woman going topless where ever she wants is not simply "her own business". Every person's actions affects other people and therefore, society at large. Democracy should mean that people form the kind of society they want to live in, and one way they do that is through laws. Certain laws can and should go against certain personal beliefs and feelings.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con: This logic would allow, and encourage the illegalization of all forms of free expression, as that causes conflict, and discomfort.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2.2.2. Con: The majority isn't always right. This has been proven countless times throughout [history](http://www.timescolonist.com/jim-hume-column-beware-the-majority-opinion-it-s-wrong-all-too-often-1.78327).
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2.2.3. Con: Majority opinion changes rapidly. Scientists have found that once [minority opinion](https://phys.org/news/2011-07-minority-scientists-ideas.html) reaches 10 percent in a population, it quickly takes over becoming the majority opinion. Thus, it is probable that women being able to show nipples in public can become the new majority.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2.2.4. Pro: Even though it's not legally mandated, many [shops](http://www.shakelaw.com/blog/refusal-of-service/) in the US enforce a "no shirt, no shoes, no service" rule.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2.2.4.1. Con: Yet those policies are not [discriminatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination) as they "don’t discriminate against any particular category of person", unlike nipple restrictions.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.2. Con: Although both male and female nipples are considered erogenous zones, women's nipples have been exploited as such to a greater extent than those of men.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.6.3.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.3. Pro: Nipples are highly [sexualized](http://www.qnews.com.au/the-wonderful-world-of-the-male-nipple/) among gay men.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.3.1. Pro: [Mr. B](http://www.misterb.com/en/play/tit-play), an international chain of stores stocks a variety of items used to enlarge and/or sensitize nipples.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.3.2. Pro: [Tom of Finland](http://bobmizer.org/blog/2009/nice-rack-tom-of-finland-in-physique-pictorial) popularized exaggerated nipples in his drawings of gay men.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.4. Pro: The development of breasts \(and the point at which we begin to censor them\) is part of puberty, and thus linked to sexual development.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.4.1. Pro: This is unique to female breasts, distinguishing them from their male counterparts.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.4.1.1. Con: 65% of boys experience some swelling or soreness around their [nipples and breasts](http://www.cyh.com/HealthTopics/HealthTopicDetails.aspx?p=240&np=297&id=2047) during puberty.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.4.2. Con: There are several dimorphic [characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sex_characteristic#Females) that distinguish men and women during puberty such as facial hair or the enlargement of the larynx in men. The fact that those characteristics, triggered by hormones, are linked to sexual development does not automatically mean they should be censored.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.5. Con: Facebook doesn't censor depictions of the vulva, vagina, or clitoris posted for educational purposes. Similar images of the female breast or breastfeeding infants, however, are only allowed if the nipples are covered. Equating nipples and vaginas thus makes no sense as they are treated differently on social media.
1.1.6.5.8.1.4.5.1. Con: Social media is only a small part of social life and not a worthy deciding factor in terms of norms.
1.1.6.5.8.2. Con: This vision is the result of a culture that conditions women and men to accept the notion that female bodies are exclusively sexual, even when acting in ways that would be innocuous and permissible for men.
1.1.6.5.8.2.1. Con: Not all detrimental meanings of public nipples stem from social conditioning.
1.1.6.5.8.2.2. Con: Butts are also not exclusively sexual, yet we do not allow anyone to show their butts in public; as it could be seen as vulgar or provoking.
1.1.6.5.8.2.2.1. Con: Thongs do quite a good job of expose the butt, and we do allow them.
1.1.6.5.8.2.2.1.1. Con: Thongs are allowed in specific settings as beaches and stripclubs or pornography  where nipple showing could also be allowed; yet not in the streets, schools, primetime TV, social media etc.
1.1.6.5.8.2.2.1.1.1. Con: They can be seen, and worn anywhere, there is no law against them, so if breasts are their equal, they should not be restricted by law either.
1.1.6.5.8.2.2.1.2. Con: We also allow tapes on nipples for some reason, yet showing the nipples would be more comparable to showing the whole butt including the line between cheeks and the anus, which is still seen as indecent.
1.1.6.5.8.2.3. Pro: Most women live in societies where fashion and media already pressure them to expose their bodies through tight clothes, mini skirts, shorts and generous cleavage, and none of it is forbidden.
1.1.6.5.8.2.3.1. Con: It is not forbidden because these clothing items are meant to enhance and show a woman's shape, not expose the entire parts.
1.1.6.5.8.2.3.2. Con: These norms already make many women feel bad about themselves. It is logical to assume that more pressure to show off their bodies will make this worse.
1.1.6.5.8.2.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.1.
1.1.6.5.8.2.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.3.5.
1.1.6.5.8.3. Pro: Breastfeeding can be considered a private act since it involves nudity.
1.1.6.5.8.3.1. Con: Breastfeeding only involves nudity if you falsely assume that female breasts are primary sexual organs.
1.1.6.5.8.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.2.1.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2. Pro: Women's nipples are too sexualized to be shown in public.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.1. Con: It is impractical to suggest that any part of anyone's body that could possibly be associated with sexuality should be covered in public at all times, as this would include many body parts that are routinely and necessarily exposed.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.2. Pro: It will take time for culture to adjust to new norms and in the meantime some people \(older people or those from more stringent cultures\) might feel discomfort.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.2.1. Con: There are countries very similar in demographics as the US that have legalized toplessness for women.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.3.2.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.2.1.2. Pro: Canada has an indecent acts law which typifies the exposure of genitals or female nipples for sexual purposes to children under 16. However, it is legal for a woman to be topless in public without any covering, provided that the act of being topless is not commercial or unduly indecent \(ie: sex workers, advertising, etc...\). [R. v. Jacob](http://www.toplessmontreal.com/civil-rights/R-vs-Jacob.pdf)...The ruling has been upheld on the grounds that being topless is not itself indecent or sexual in nature. This has been law since 1996 without any incident.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.2.1.2.1. Con: In 2017 a woman filed a [complaint](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/topless-swimming-pools-ontario-human-rights-1.4214832) with the Human Rights Tribunal in Ontario because she was not allowed to swim topless.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.2.1.3. Pro: Countries that do allow women to show their nipples have suffered no demonstrable harms. Liberty should not be restricted without evidence showing a rational basis for the restriction.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.2.2. Con: The discomfort that some people may feel should not supersede the rights of an entire gender.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.2.2.1. Pro: Some US citizens, especially older generations, were used to [racially-segregated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States) spaces and [inter-racial marriages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage_in_the_United_States) to be forbidden, and yet the country recognized that the rights of minorities should be over the potential discomfort of some.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3. Pro: Female nudity is generally only shown on television in a sexual context, which weakens the argument that 'women's nipples need not be covered since they are not inherently sexual'.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.1. Con: This is a symptom of society's unhealthy attitudes toward female nudity, not evidence of nipples' inherent sexual qualities.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.5.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.1.2.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.2. Con: The sexuality of women's nipples is not inherent, rather that is the way that it is presented in society and on television. When restrictions are lifted, this norm may change.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.2.1. Pro: Removing restrictions can widen the range in which female breasts are exposed beyond sexual situations \(or to appeal the [male gaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_gaze)\) thus giving agency and desexualising the female body.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.8.1.2.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.2.1.2. Con: Eliminating nipple restrictions could have the opposite effect of ["re-sexualizing](http://thoughtcatalog.com/julia-aldrich/2016/01/if-youre-for-free-the-nipple-you-shouldnt-call-yourself-a-feminist/)" breasts instead of de-sexualizing them, since it brings all the attention straight towards a woman's chest.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.2.1.2.1. Pro: Society's sexualizing attitude towards the female body will not be changed until people are able to view women as more than just their body parts. Focusing on nipples narrows women down to their breasts, making it harder for society to view women as complete beings.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.2.1.2.2. Pro: Clothing, preferably comfortable, is what enables some women's [privacy](https://www.google.com.co/amp/s/verilymag.com/.amp/2016/07/empowerment-feminism-sexualization-women-nudi) and style, deterring judgement towards their bodies, separating their sexuality from nonsexual contexts and making it intimate and thus more powerful.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.3. Con: Gratuitous [female](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/05/female-nudity-three-times-likely-male-hollywood-films) [nudity](http://www.nyfa.edu/film-school-blog/gender-inequality-in-film/) is used as a trick to attract viewers \(generally [male](https://www.moviefone.com/2016/01/07/hbo-boss-on-why-theres-more-female-nudity-vs-male-white-men-produce-shows/) viewers\) and therefore often used in contexts where there is no sexual activity: a woman changing clothes, a woman getting in the shower or even as a corpse.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4. Pro: Sexual organs should be hidden because most people do not want to see or think about the sexual organs of their friends or family, only those they are intimately interested in.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.2.1.1.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.4.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.3. Pro: The female breast is a sexual organ, the male breast is not. Evidence for this is that female breast development occurs as a component result of sexual maturation, and the [male breast](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/puberty/Pages/puberty-signs.aspx) does not. Female cleavage or upper thigh exposure is more comparable to male breast exposure, and here we already have equality.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.3.1. Con: There is no known method by which someone could reproduce by means of their nipples, or breasts.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.3.2. Con: By this logic, armpit hair is a sex organ, as it develops during puberty, and should thus be censored.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.3.3. Con: By this logic, the mouth is a sex organ, as it is an erogenous zone, and should thus be censored.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.5.1.

1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.3.7. Pro: [Psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relations_theory) sees that female breasts as an early form of object relation for all children, or a focus for the satisfaction of the libidinal ego or drive in early development; which adds up to the [erotic or sexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_fetishism) power breasts can have during adult life.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.3.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.3.9. Con: The female breast and nipple are not [inherently sexual](https://theconversation.com/no-youre-not-hardwired-to-stare-at-womens-breasts-53449). Many societies do not view female breast sexually, and see their sexualization as a distortion of their primary function, that is, to feed children.

1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7. Pro: Breasts are one of the most sexualized parts of women's bodies and this cannot be eliminated, as they are a sign of sexual maturity.

1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5. Pro: Heterosexual men are always going to be attracted to this feature.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.1. Pro: Men are extremely drawn to breasts for biological reasons. [Research](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-young-phd/breasts_b_1910401.html) indicates that when men are confronted with breasts, or even breast-related stimuli like bras, they are more distracted and likely to make worse choices.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2. Pro: [Fat deposition](http://www.iamnotthebabysitter.com/what-is-the-difference-between-female-and-male-breasts/) in the breasts, buttock and hips of women has been preferred as a sign of 'high reproductive value and potential' for males. Therefore, men are innately attracted to these features, which cannot be changed.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1. Pro: The fatty tissue of buttocks, hips and breasts in women is [promoted](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormonal_breast_enhancement) by the female sexual hormone \(estrogen\) which also induces their reproductive organs, starts ovulation, sustains the health of many systems and it is related to an attractive [personality](https://www.google.com.co/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/200907/sex-hormones-and-womanly-passions%3famp); thus there is a personal advantage for men who eroticize those features \(a chance of healthier offspring and better/longer relationships\), making its public display \(when uncalled for\) a window for distracting sexual thinking and judgement.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.1. Con: Finger length is determined in part [by sexual hormones](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201610/the-neuroscience-finger-length-ratio-and-athletic-prowess), if all changes brought about by sexual hormones should be censored, gloves should be mandatory.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Finger length has not yet becomed eroticized [as much as](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/201409/do-men-mostly-prefer-breasts-or-buns) breasts and buttocks have been \(by sociosexual culture and by an [early unconscious relation](http://www.encyclopedia.com/psychology/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/breast-goodbad-object)\).

1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.4. Con: The bigger muscles, deep voice and tall stature of men is promoted by the male sexual hormone \([testosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone)\), which also induces their reproductive organs, starts spermogenesis, sustains the health of many systems and thus there is a personal advantage for women who eroticize those features, making its public display \(when uncalled for\) a window for distracting sexual thinking and judgment. As showed, the exact same thing can be said about a man's sexual characteristics, yet they are not banned.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.4.1. Con: Censoring someone´s voice would impose a disability to them, and/or would be too difficult to achieve.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.4.1.1. Con: Censoring this characteristic would be hard, and unfair. Neither of those factors have had any effect whatsoever on the state of female censorship.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.4.1.2. Con: Just because it is hard, or disabling is not a reason not to do it, assuming the reasons for doing it are as legitimate as we say they are for females.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.4.2. Con: Censoring someone's height would be too difficult to achieve.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.5.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.4.4. Pro: Just because something can be classified as a secondary sexual characteristic does not mean it should be banned.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.4.5. Pro: The only secondary characteristic to be singled out and banned is the female nipple \(not even the whole breast\).

1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.6. Pro: Breasts are one of two highly different body parts between man and woman, therefore they are sexualized. Breast of women change dramatically with maturity, while those of men only slightly.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.7. Con: There is no reason for a part of the body to be more censored than another.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.8. Pro: Since breasts are so sexualized, some [argue](http://time.com/collection-post/4029633/alyssa-milano-should-we-freethenipple/) that fighting to remove nipple restrictions for women is analogous to encouraging objectification of the female body.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.9. Con: Men consider women's cleavages to be just as distracting. Still, there is no law against showing them.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.9.1. Con: The nipples were taken by the [FCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission) as the uncrossable [line](http://rebrn.com/re/eli-in-the-usa-why-does-the-fcc-allow-all-of-a-female-breast-to-129679/) because it was too difficult to determine how much breast skin displayed could be counted as indecent. So different sizes of breasts are less relevant than showing nipples.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.9.1.1. Con: These rules are arbitrary even in the guidelines that define them.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.9.2. Con: There was such law before \(or at least social agreement\) but it was lightened and because nipple is the most intimate and distinguishable point of breast is set as lightest possible border.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.10. Pro: It's not only men who find breasts sexually appealing, as [most women](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/columns/straight-dope/article/13045218/why-are-women-expected-to-keep-their-nipples-covered-breasts) find their breasts to be a source of sexual pleasure. Eliminating restrictions on revealing nipples is not going to change that.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8. Pro: Showing women's nipples in public is detrimental to children, and thus should be restricted.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.1. Pro: Exposure of mammary glands could overstimulate males at or before puberty.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.1.1. Con: It is unclear if any potential 'over-stimulation' that could occur would be, or result in a serious, or even detrimental medical condition in this case.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.1.2. Con: This problem does not exist in cultures that treat toplessness of either sex as normal.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.1.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.1.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.2. Con: In the Victorian era, women's legs were commonly [hidden](http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/p/pantomime-acts/) in long dresses as they were deemed too sexual for the time's morals. Female legs were only acceptable on stage, as family theatre productions often used female actresses to play male protagonists as a way to be more [appealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantomime#Performance_conventions) to male audiences. Nowadays, it is acceptable for adults and children to see bare female legs in public, media or art.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.3. Con: A woman showing her nipples is not harmful in any way. Women expose their nipples when breastfeeding, therefore nipples are not harmful for children, nor are they harmful for anyone else, just like men's nipples.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.5. Pro: Female nipple showing would force children and other non-consenting adults to see and be exposed to sexual body parts they should not or do not want to see.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.5.1. Con: Female nipples are not more sexual body parts than are male nipples, thus the effect of seeing them by children and non-consenting adults would be precisely the same as seeing a male nipple.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.6. Pro: Seeing nudity at a [young age](http://www.ncsby.org/content/childhood-sexual-development) can potentially create premature sexual curiosity in children, especially at preschool age.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.6.1. Con: If restrictions on exposing nipples were eliminated, then it might lead to children being taught about nudity, boundaries, and consent at an earlier age. This could make it safer for women in the long run.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.6.2. Pro: Children at this age express their curiosity through questions and touching. Without the same understanding of boundaries as adults, they may inappropriately address or touch a woman's exposed nipples.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.6.2.1. Con: Children learn through trial and error and are often socially inappropriate, yet adults understand they are still learning. If they touch someone without their permission, they will be taught not to do it again as with many other inappropriate behaviours.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.6.3. Con: The cited article also explains that when nudity is accepted and physical privacy is not encouraged, children tend to have more “typical \([nonintrusive](http://www.ncsby.org/content/childhood-sexual-development)\) sexual behaviors” than when modesty and privacy are reinforced.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.7. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.8. Con: Being exposed to nipples is only harmful to children as we teach them that they should be kept hidden.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.9. Pro: What a child is exposed to should be at the discretion of the parents. They cannot control this if nipple showing is not restricted.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.9.1. Con: This is not the [case](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3194801/) with [education](https://www.aclu.org/other/state-tennessee-v-scopes) or with sex. Parents have repetitively shown they are incapable of determining what information is good for their kids, and in this matter, the kids' rights outweigh the parents'.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.9.2. Con: Parents aren't in control now either. If a parent wants their children to see other people's nipples, they cannot start pulling at their clothes. The ones in control are the people who's bodies are concerned.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.9.3. Con: Some people [argue](http://www.livestrong.com/article/562446-parents-who-try-to-keep-their-children-dependent/) that overprotective parenting negatively affects children as they grow up. Limiting what a child should or should not be exposed to when out in public could classify as overprotective behavior.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.9.3.1. Con: Conversely, limiting a child's exposure to certain harmful things can reduce their chance of exhibiting negative behaviors later in life. Thus, protecting your child in this way has a positive effect.

1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.9.4. Con: If this was true, Muslim parents would have the right to force all women to wear a burka, whether they were Muslim or not, claiming they did not want their children to be exposed to non-Muslim women's hair/ankles/bellies. This is clearly not the case.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.9.5. Con: Parents' control is by no means absolute. We would not, for example, consider it reasonable for a parent to shelter their child from seeing other, non-sexual body parts like ankles or ears.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.10. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.5.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.11. Con: It is also important to teach children not to discriminate between men and women.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9. Con: Removing restrictions can change society's sexualizing attitude towards women's bodies.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2. Con: As sexualisation of breasts can be beneficial to some women, allowing them to show their nipples in public may decrease the sexual interest and pleasure associated with the female nipple.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1. Pro: De-sexualizing nipples in public may de-sexualize nipples in private for some [people](https://jezebel.com/5456313/on-nudity-and-lack-thereof-why-being-naked-isnt-always-awesome), which could reduce the [ways](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_fetish) in which women are sexually desirable to men.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.1. Con: Although individuals might benefit from their own sexualization, no reason is given why sexually desirability to men is valuable to society as a whole.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.2. Con: Americans have a long culture of valuing freedom over death, and it seems trivial to assume that one would value life over sex, so it is fair to posit that given the choice between bodily freedom, and sexual enrichment, most people would chose more freedom.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.2.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.3. Con: 'It is unlikely that breasts being normalized in public will de-sexualize them, as the porn industry has a strong and universal following that capitalizes on sexualizing women's breasts.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.3.1. Con: Pornography uses the feeling of breaking boundaries to provide sexual arousal which can easily be taken to dangerous levels; by removing boundaries on privacy in public settings, we encourage pornography to exploit edgier and more harmful ideas.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.3.1.1. Con: There are laws put in place to prevent such abuses.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con: Those laws have not put an end to the promotion of abuse and violence [in and by](https://strengthtofight.ca/beingagainstsexualabusemeantihadtofightporn/) pornography.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.4. Con: In many European countries where there are no such restrictions, the sex and [porn](http://www.economywatch.com/world-industries/porn-industry.html) industries generate big [revenues](http://www.familysafemedia.com/pornography_statistics.html) and do not seem affected.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.4.1. Con: The prosperity of the sex industries is not an indicator of healthy relationships, but quite the opposite.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.5. Con: If everyone was less sexualised and being sexually desirable was less important, it would benefit each individual more and therefore be more beneficial globally.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.6. Pro: Sexual desire is important in sustaining relationships as relationship therapists [have found](http://www.hitchedmag.com/article.php?id=1103), it promotes sexual intimacy, [helping](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-therapy/201204/why-do-we-have-sex) to build better bonds and thus adding to the stability of romantic relationships which are important to the mental and physical [health](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/01/18/loneliness-might-be-a-bigger-health-risk-than-smoking-or-obesity/?s=trending#73b99b813657) of all individuals.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.6.1. Con: For a couple that has been together for a long time, nudity is likely normal and yet sexual desire can be maintained. If not getting used to see breasts was totally necessary to keep sexual desire, most couples would have none.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.6.2. Pro: Most topless tribes reject the sexualization of this highly sensitive and arousing organ in defense of giving a higher moral meaning to breastfeeding \(which can easily be hold legal in public as an exception to the rule, or be made private by a simple blanket\), which can be considered by [some women](http://theweek.com/articles/561537/why-feminists-are-fighting-losing-battle-over-boobs) as a 'mental mastectomy' in modern times, because they are losing parts of their sexual and sensual potential/power.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.6.3. Pro: Long lasting couples dont walk around naked or topless all the time as tribes people, and most women would prefer covering breasts after sexual encounters to mark a mental distinction to other mental states and daily activities, in so doing they are protecting the sexual symbolism and potential of female breasts.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.7. Pro: The [sexual response](http://www.science20.com/rogue_neuron/science_pleasure_part_ii_your_brain_sexual_imagery) is built on anticipation which is what spikes the levels of dopamine [related](https://thecolemaninstitute.com/tci-blog/72-dopamine-the-anticipation-molecule) to the thrill of the chase and the search for new things; overexposure of eroticized features can overestimulate dopamine receptors and decrease their responsivenes as seen in addiction.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.8. Pro: Most psychoanalitic models and theories [regard](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alissa-fleck/the-basic-economical-psyc_b_4493431.html) desire and satisfaction as [linked to](http://realitysandwich.com/318605/desire-is-the-truth-of-it-jacques-lacan-and-wanting-wanting/) fantasy and imagination,  which is reduced in a context of public nudity.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.9. Con: The purpose of female anatomy is not to emphasize social appreciation of nudity, therefore it is irrelevant whether society is more or less sensitized to female nipples.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.8.1.2.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.3. Con: Women's pleasure associated with nipples often comes from stimulation, therefore, even if nipples are socially less desired, as an [erogenous](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201305/sexual-wiring-womens-breasts) zone, they can still be pleasurable.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4. Pro: Removing restrictions on exposing nipples could be harmful to those who work in the sex industry, since they rely on the sexualization of breasts to make money.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4.1. Con: Removing restrictions can positively evolve the sex industry towards more creative ways to satisfy their customers.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4.2. Con: Seeing and not being able to touch exposed breasts at liberty is likely to lead to increased arousal and desire for sexual pleasure. Thus, removing restrictions can increase demand for the sex industry.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4.3. Con: The sex industry is not solely reliant on the sexualisation of women's breasts.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4.3.1. Con: While it is not solely reliant on this, breasts and female topless nudity plays a huge role in pornographic video and advertising. The profitability and intrigue of showing nipples is likely to decrease if they can be seen freely in public.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4.3.1.1. Con: There is a big difference between seeing nude breasts casually on the street and seeing them in a pornographic setting where they serve an obviously sexual purpose. Consumers of topless pornography will continue to spend money on it since they wouldn't find the eroticism that they desire by merely looking at topless women in public.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4.3.1.1.1. Pro: That is the case in Germany or Spain, where nudism and women going [topless](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2692949/Getting-naked-Germans-like-nude-holiday-holidaymakers-country-say-Expedia.html) is common in leisure places \(like beaches\) and they still have a very strong [porn](http://www.economywatch.com/world-industries/porn-industry.html) industry.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.1.4.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4.5. Pro: If people were exposed to nipples more often in non-sexual settings, then breasts would become less sexualized and subsequently less profitable.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4.6. Con: A society that objectifies women's bodies less will probably make society safer for sex workers.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.2.2.6.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.4.6.2. Pro: As there is some link between the sexualisation and objectification of women and violence, a decrease may be [safer](https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/not-object-sexualization-and-exploitation-women-and-girls/30361) for all women.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.3. Pro: Because of existing restrictions, the female nipple has become eroticized and considered indecent. With restrictions removed, seeing exposed nipples in public will become normalized and thus less explicitly sexual.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.3.1. Pro: Women's [hair and ankles](http://www.iflscience.com/brain/no-you-re-not-hardwired-stare-women-s-breasts/) are considered highly erotic in cultures that require them to be covered, but are innocuous in the West where they are freely revealed. The same principle can be applied to breasts.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.3.1.1. Con: Erotization of female body parts by covering them with clothes may be a desirable effect, specially to women, as long as the clothes are comfortable and harmless.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.3.1.1.1. Con: By that logic, as many parts of women's bodies are socialised to be erotised, women should be completely covered by clothes which may not be comfortable or socially just.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.3.1.1.1.1. Con: There can be a balance in clothing in which women feel at the same time comfortable and desirable.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Where that line is is for the individual women's to decide, not us.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.4. Con: Even if this is true, the change will not happen overnight. Society can expect a long interim period full of discomfort, harassment, and other potential negatives that might arise from nipple exposure. Keeping women's nipples covered is therefore the best way to minimize damage throughout society.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.4.1. Con: In the same vein, women would not start walking around topless overnight. Many women are conditioned through a lifetime of societal pressure to cover up and would be uncomfortable exposing themselves.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.4.2. Con: Women have been facing violence and discomfort for decades. Four out of five women in [India](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-women-harassment-cities-idINKCN0YE23R) face public harassment, whether their bodies are covered or not. In the US, [65%](http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/our-work/nationalstudy/) of women have previously experienced street harassment. So arguably, there is no added damage for women.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.1.1.1.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.5. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.2.1.2.

1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11. Pro: Seeing a topless woman in public may cause spontaneous arousal in men, resulting in a public erection.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.1. Con: Arousal in men is not more important than a woman, or her rights.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.2. Pro: There is overwhelming [evidence](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-young-phd/breasts_b_1910401.html) that men are generally  aroused by female breasts for biological reasons. Possible reasoning is that humans are the [only mammal](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/may/14/breast-size-evolution) whose mammary glands become and remain enlarged outside of nursing.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.3. Con: Tight clothing can also produce spontaneous arousal. The addition of nipple will not make a big difference to it, once it has become societally normal.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.3.1. Pro: The more exposure men have to seeing breasts in a non-sexualized way in public, the less they will experience public arousal.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.3.1.1. Pro: A stimulus has a diminishing emotional response after [repeated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desensitization_\(psychology\)) exposure. Thus, it is possible that with repeated exposure to seeing breasts in public, men will have a diminished response of arousal.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.4. Con: Seeing a topless man may cause arousal in women, resulting in lack of public comfort. Men socially tend to express it while women tend to oppress it. So just because socially it is accepted till now does not mean that male arousal cannot be physically controlled exactly as female arousal \(assuming both male and female put the same effort on controlling it\).
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.4.1. Con: Sometimes men cannot control their [arousal](http://www.livescience.com/5804-men-control-arousal.html), and thus cannot control their erection. This is likely to cause them public embarrassment.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.4.1.1. Pro: Despite erections often being involuntary, some women might construe them as sexual harassment. In addition to making women feel unsafe, this could potentially lead to legal battles.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.4.2. Con: Arousal in woman doesn't have obvious visual effects.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.4.1.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.6. Pro: It will likely cause many women, topless or not, to feel uncomfortable even though it is an involuntary biological response to seeing something pleasing like women's nipples.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.4.1.1.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.7. Con: The same society which stigmatises women's nipples is the one which dictates men feel shame about their body \(e.g. erections\) as well. Decreasing this stigma benefits everyone.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.11.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.
1.1.6.5.8.3.2.12. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.1.4.
1.1.6.5.9. Pro: Restricting where women can breastfeed puts unnecessary financial strain on mothers by requiring that they purchase bottles, breast pumps, infant formula, nursing covers, etc. to keep from exposing their breasts in public.
1.1.6.6. Con: Women going topless in public may also get shamed if their breasts do not conform to other peoples' expectations of what breasts are supposed to look like.
1.1.6.6.1. Con: The fact that someone may be shamed in some way or another for showing a certain body part, does not make it okay to ban that body part from public display. With that logic all individuals should cover themselves from head to toe to prevent being scrutinised in any way.
1.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.
1.1.8. Pro: Banning nipple showing in public and media fails to respect women's dignity.
1.1.8.1. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.1.8.2. Pro: According to [Kant's Formula of Humanity](https://www.academia.edu/20907784/Free_the_Nipple), when a rational being is deprived of their autonomy to choose and is objectified, this represents a violation of human dignity.
1.1.8.2.1. Pro: Restrictions to liberty are allowed when something is a [threat to public order or security.](https://www.academia.edu/20907784/Free_the_Nipple) The banning of female nipples can only be justified if their exposure in public and in media is meant to jeopardise the social order, which is not the case.
1.1.9. Con: If women were allowed to show their nipples, they would still be subjected to discrimination and judgment if, for example, their breasts do not conform to socially constructed standards of beauty.
1.1.9.1. Con: This argument suggests that our only goal should be the unobtainable one of perfection.  A small positive shift still moves the world in a better direction.
1.1.9.2. Con: Women are already subjected to that kind of scrutiny for all other parts of their body. Breasts are also not banned from view, only the nipple, so this happens already. Banning women from wearing the same as their male counterparts does nothing to "shield" them from this, thus it is pointless.
1.1.9.3. Pro: This movement in favor of nipple showing is [championed](http://thoughtcatalog.com/julia-aldrich/2016/01/if-youre-for-free-the-nipple-you-shouldnt-call-yourself-a-feminist/) by Western women of higher economic standing who are usually young, thin, and white. Most women who do not fall under that narrow demographic umbrella are left alienated.
1.1.9.3.1. Con: The fact that removing nipple restrictions does not include everyone, or it is not a demand from everyone, is not a reason to not do so.
1.1.9.3.2. Con: This movement has appeared to a great extent in response to social media censoring policies. It is equally arguable that those sites are imposing their US [values](http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikk/Breastfeeding-becomes-sex-Sex-is-savagery-Rape-jokes-are-tolerated-Welcome-to-the-world-of-Facebook--Jane-Fae-604876b.html) on the rest of the world.
1.1.9.3.3. Pro: The international group Femen has protested the treatment of [Amina Tyler](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/04/international-topless-jihad-day_n_3014943.html#slide=2299087) using [Islamophobic](https://jezebel.com/5993775/muslim-women-shockingly-not-grateful-for-topless-european-ladies-trying-to-save-them) imagery, causing concern among Muslim women.
1.1.9.3.3.1. Con: A single activist or a group does not represent everyone fighting for a cause. The fact that some are insensitive or even oppressive towards others does not invalidate the intrinsic value of their cause.
1.1.9.3.4. Pro: Western feminism often tries to establish a single "correct" way of having agency and choice. A [study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886109914546126) showed that when Muslim women choose to wear modest clothing, for example a hijab, their agency and personal choices are often drawn into question by Western feminism as these choices are stereotyped as oppression and submission.
1.1.9.3.4.1. Con: The keyword here is "choose". The discussion is not about women choosing not to show their nipples, but being forced to. Just as many Muslim women [are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Saudi_Arabia#Dress) [forced to wear a hijab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab_by_country#Iran). Their agency and personal choices have nothing to do with this issue. No-one should be forced to wear, or not to wear, anything the other sex is allowed to.
1.1.9.4. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.3.5.1.
1.1.10. Con: What is liberating is relative. Some groups of women believe that modesty is more liberating than nudity.
1.1.10.1. Con: For those women that embrace the choice to show their nipples, eliminating gender-specific restrictions is still valuable.
1.1.10.2. Pro: Modest dress is [liberating](http://forward.com/opinion/205391/modesty-is-the-new-black/) to some women because it gives them the opportunity to rise above objectification.
1.1.10.3. Con: Modesty is a choice that is freely and commonly available to women. The choice to expose her nipples is not.
1.1.10.4. Pro: A society that becomes more liberal and creates expectations of women showing their nipples may oppress women who prefer to be conservative.
1.1.10.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.20.1.1.
1.1.10.5. Pro: Liberal attitudes regarding standards of dress may shame women with certain religious beliefs - for example, women who choose to wear the burqa.
1.1.11. Con: -> See 1.1.4.7.
1.2. Pro: Women should have free choice over showing their nipples.
1.2.1. Pro: A woman showing her nipples in public does not directly harm anyone else.
1.2.1.1. Con: The same argument may be made for complete nudity.  A man does not directly harm anyone else if he exposes his genitals in public.  Yet most can agree that the prohibition on that is reasonable.
1.2.1.1.1. Con: A prohibition on nudity is not reasonable. There is no reason it should be done, as the practice harms no one, and the prohibition, being a violations of civil rights, hurts everyone.
1.2.1.2. Con: Respecting sex means to value the privacy of people's experience of their own sexuality \(be it for procreation or recreation\), separating it from random social pressure and opinion. Exposure of arousal can be humiliating in social contexts and female nipples can expose or be misinterpreted as female arousal if erect, or arouse men in social situations \(showing nervousness, distractability, restlessness...\)
1.2.1.2.1. Con: Behaving with respect to other's internal experiences is an exercise in futility. It's simply not possible to read minds.
1.2.1.2.1.1. Con: Civility is built on behaving with respect to the internal experience of others.
1.2.1.2.2. Con: However, respecting people in general should also mean that men's sexuality and its consequences should not take precent over women's bodies.
1.2.2. Pro: Policing only female bodies normalizes and perpetuates the tradition of opening women's personal choices to public opinion.
1.2.3. Pro: Liberty means doing as you choose, as long as you do not violate the rights of others. Nipples don't violate people's rights. Restriction of liberty is done out of fear, not principle.
1.2.3.1. Pro: The restrictions should be lifted because they help to self-expression.
1.2.4. Con: Men are also not allowed to show their chests in some private places or while in public office. There should be some designated settings were neither male nor female nipples are allowed \('nipple unfriendly' contexts\).
1.2.4.1. Con: However, women are not allowed to show their chests in all public places in USA. In many places in Europe where female nudity is allowed, women generally do not exercise that right in the office or in the streets. The right is only commonly exercised while sunbathing on the beach or in parks.
1.2.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.20.1.1.
1.2.4.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.5.1.
1.2.5. Con: Society might not yet be ready since female body is highly objectified and sexualized. Freeing the nipple might be too bold: an educational campaign should address this issues before and not after this motion.
1.2.5.1. Con: Societal readiness is not an adequate ground to deny rights.
1.2.6. Pro: It is only fair that if a man can go without a shirt in public, a woman should have the same right. People can make their own decision if they want to be exposed or not.
1.2.7. Pro: Freedom and lack of prejudices improve societies and, as that is precisely what 'Free the Nipple' campaign has been trying to do over generations, it is a worthy cause.
1.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.2.2.1.
1.2.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.2.3.
1.2.10. Pro: A crux of [feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism) is that women should have the right to choose what they do with their bodies. To deny women this choice is to deny them equality.
1.2.10.1. Con: Gender equality could thus be achieved by restricting the exposure of both men's and women's nipples in public, instead of removing restrictions for only women when men also lack the same right to choose as women.
1.2.10.1.1. Con: It is unclear if there is any example available that would apply to men, but not have an equally applicable example for women.
1.2.10.1.2. Con: Instead of equal restriction, equal elimination of restrictions could be made possible as well.
1.2.10.1.3. Con: Censoring only "below the belt" areas for everyone brings equality for all.
1.2.10.1.4. Pro: Men being prohibited from shirtlessness in public would allow them to better understand the way women feel on hot days or in other instances where they'd prefer to be topless.
1.2.10.1.4.1. Con: Men often do jobs that would be cumbersome with a shirt such as construction on hot days. Requiring them to wear shirts would restrict their productivity. It would be better to give women the same productivity boost by allowing them to also be shirtless.
1.2.10.2. Pro: One of the defining features of patriarchal societies has often been that they control women's bodies through law and social structures.
1.2.10.3. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.2.10.4. Pro: [Article 1](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) of the United Declaration of Human Rights states: 'All human beings are born free and equal of dignity and rights'. That women are not allowed the same freedom as men in showing their nipples suggests such restrictions are in violation of this.
1.2.10.4.1. Con: Dignity is a part of the statement. Rights that violate human dignity ought not be recognized as rights.
1.2.10.4.1.1. Con: [Dignity](http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-dign/) is a very contested and subjective concept and thus for governments to respect it, individuals should be awarded equal freedom as to what violates their dignity.
1.2.10.4.1.2. Con: Equality is there too, and it's dignified to be treated equally.
1.2.10.5. Con: Not all [feminists](http://theconversation.com/no-feminism-is-not-about-choice-40896) share this belief.
1.2.10.5.1. Con: The article exemplifies the use of "empowerment" or "choice" to keep certain sexist attitudes and points out that individual choices are “shaped and constrained by unequal conditions” of the system as a whole. That wide critique does not invalidate the fact that women should have the same equality and freedom as men, which can be applied to the censorship of only women's nipples.
1.2.10.5.2. Pro: The same "choice feminism" that wants to ban nipple restrictions also supports women's rights to work in the sex industry, which many feminists are ardently against.
1.2.10.5.2.1. Con: Feminism is indeed a myriad of perspectives, yet there is something most currents agree upon: women should have the same rights as men. Therefore women's nudity should be regulated or not, the same as men's.
1.2.10.5.2.1.1. Con: [Difference feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_feminism) states that there are differences between men and women that are not and should not be considered equally. These feminists would probably argue that men and women's bodies are physically different and that this justifies different rules around nudity.
1.2.10.5.2.1.1.1. Con: Difference feminism was developed in the 1980s and 1990s as part of second-wave feminism. It is outdated today.
1.2.10.5.3. Pro: Some intersectional feminists might argue that eliminating restrictions against exposing nipples is anti-feminist, since the “Free the Nipple” campaign fails to include most women of color and other minorities.
1.2.10.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.3.
1.2.10.5.3.2. Pro: [Historically](http://openworks.wooster.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=blackandgold), white women are encouraged to be chaste and pure while Black women are highly sexualized and fetishized. Although the #freethenipple movement might be beneficial to achieving gender equality for white women by helping them publicly embrace and reclaim their sexuality, Black women and other minorities need a more nuanced approach that will not objectify them further.
1.2.10.5.3.3. Con: -> See 1.1.9.3.1.
1.2.10.5.4. Pro: The feminist movement is [fractured](http://www.caragillis.com/LBCC/Different%20Types%20of%20Femini.htm), since not all groups within the feminist collective share the same goals.
1.2.10.5.4.1. Con: The fact that specific policies may be divisive does not mean they should not be implemented if they ensure equality. Once the policy is implemented, individuals can always choose how to act.
1.2.11. Con: It is reasonable to restrict freedom of choice when that action may have harmful consequences for the individual or for a broader collective.
1.2.11.1. Pro: As women are more [prone to start and follow beauty trends, this may induce a wave of nipple plastic surgery](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/designer-nipple-cosmetic-surgery-dr-norman-rowe-kendall-jenner-bella-hadid-a7818011.html) and/or [piercing](https://www.today.com/health/can-nipple-piercing-be-dangerous-2D80555082) which could be done irresponsibly leading to infections, mastitis, deformities, \(...\) and/or lactating problems.
1.2.11.1.1. Con: There is no reason to assume that people would not practice proper, and existing safety standards for nipple piercings, and other related operations.
1.2.11.1.2. Pro: Even if surgeries and piercings are done in optimal conditions, there's always a significant percentage of scaring, deformity and adverse consequences to them; specially if done in delicate areas such as nipples and breasts.
1.2.11.1.2.1. Con: If the harms of nipple piercing are that dangerous, maybe then that practice should be prohibited or stricter regulations should be put in place, yet that is not intrinsically a reason to prohibit female nipples exposure.
1.2.11.1.3. Con: It may also induce a wave of knowledge surrounding breast health if nipples are allowed to be shown. This could lead to quicker diagnoses of breast cancer and other related illnesses, saving more of women's lives.
1.2.11.2. Con: Freedom of choice is largely restricted to protect people from bodily harm e.g. requiring people to wear seat belts and making many drugs illegal. Giving women the right to show their nipples does not meet this threshold.
1.2.11.3. Pro: Showing nipples is indecent and violates public sensibilities.
1.2.11.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2.2.
1.2.11.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.1.
1.2.11.3.3. Pro: Some people wouldn't be comfortable with women showing their nipples.
1.2.11.3.3.1. Con: If some people not being comfortable with something was sufficient to consider it incident, everything, even contradictory things, would be incident.
1.2.11.3.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.7.
1.2.11.3.3.3. Con: Some people would say that a little discomfort is necessary in pursuit of achieving gender equality.
1.2.11.3.3.4. Pro: The US is comprised of people from many major religions that adhere to [modest dress codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modesty#Religious_traditions) for women. They would undoubtedly be uncomfortable with women freely showing their nipples.
1.2.11.3.3.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.11.3.3.3.
1.2.11.3.3.4.2. Pro: Some conservative Christians would welcome stricter laws against indecent exposure: a Republican representative introduced a [bill](http://time.com/3705394/montana-yoga-pants-ban/) outlawing any nipple exposure for women and men, as well as any tight-fitting clothing.
1.2.11.3.3.4.2.1. Con: However, unlike the present restriction, this bill is not rooted in gender discrimination as it affects everybody equally.
1.2.11.3.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.1.2.
1.2.11.3.5. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.5.5.1.1.2.
1.2.11.4. Con: The sight of nude nipples do not cause physical or psychological harm to onlookers. This is proven by the fact that no known harm of a physical or psychological nature have been ever reported in places where women can be topless in public.
1.2.11.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.2.11.4.2. Con: While it does not cause actual harm, the sight of nude nipples can cause a disturbance, especially for a civilization that is much more mature than that.
1.2.11.5. Con: The government can regulate human activity only when there is at least some reasonable basis for such regulation. For example when such activity is hurmful to another humans, society or community at large. When such harm exist government should balance freedoms of the individual against needs of the society. But in this case no harm to anyone can be identified. So there is no rational-based reason to maintain such regulations.
1.2.11.6. Pro: Women do not want to be objectified by their bodies. Showing nipples is not a way to avoid objectification. It flies in the face of human instinct, as [men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2739403/) evolved to determine sexual "viability" visually. Instinct is hard wired, not a choice.
1.2.11.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.2.11.8. Con: There are many nations where it is legal to be topless.  There are US cities where it is legal.  There are beaches where you can be nude.  No measurable harm has come to individuals or society from this action. If anyone commits assault based on it this we should do a better job restricting assault, as we restrict robberies instead of expensive watches.
1.2.11.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.2.1.
1.2.11.9. Con: The government can regulate human activity only when such activity is harmful to other humans, society or community at large. When such harm exist government should balance freedom and needs of the society. But in this case there is no known harm to anyone. So there is no rational-based reason to maintain such regulations.
1.2.11.10. Pro: Freedom of [choice](https://psychcentral.com/news/2011/03/30/is-too-much-freedom-of-choice-a-problem/24820.html) has been shown to make people less supportive and empathetic towards policies that promote equality and the betterment of society.
1.2.11.10.1. Pro: [Studies](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/your-money/27shortcuts.html) have also shown that freedom of choice can actually lead to greater levels of dissatisfaction, as people are often left wondering if they made the wrong decision or could have chosen a better option.
1.2.11.11. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.
1.3. Con: Women should preserve their nudity for their partners.
1.3.1. Con: Any woman who wishes to treat her sexuality as reserved for her relationship would be free to do that, just as people who do not smoke are free to not smoke.
1.3.1.1. Pro: Removing restrictions on exposed nipples does not prevent women from preserving the private nature of their nudity, it only empowers them to choose to do so or not, rather than having that decision forced upon them.
1.3.2. Pro: In an attempt to protect their female partners from the inappropriate responses from others, violent confrontations are likely to occur. This can be avoided with restrictions on female nipple exposure.
1.3.2.1. Con: This assumes that women are responsible for the actions of others around them. Women are no more responsible for their partners acting out in their defense than they are for a stranger on the street assaulting them.
1.3.2.2. Con: Violence is an unjustified response, and should be dealt with as a separate issue.
1.3.2.3. Con: This assumes that a woman necessarily needs a strong male partner to protect her from other men. However, women need to be treated as equal citizens and be protected by the authorities, not by this "[benevolent sexism](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rebecca-griffin/thanks-but-no-thanks-women-dont-need-your-protection_b_9301836.html)".
1.3.3. Con: Women are not objects, or property. They are independent adults with their own autonomy and agency. They are not prizes to be won.
1.3.4. Pro: It is biologically reasonable for male partners to want women to restrict sexual displays. The less women sexually display, the less they will attract competing males. That increases the chance of the male's gene reproduction.
1.3.4.1. Con: If exposing nipples generates more mating potential for an individual, that individual has the right to do so.
1.3.4.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.1.
1.3.4.2. Pro: As sex is for procreation, covering the sexual parts of our body for modesty reasons shows that we respect this.
1.3.4.2.1. Con: Rights such as bodily autonomy and free expression are more important than reproducing. Respecting women should come before compulsively requiring them to procreate.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: Sex does not have to be performed in order to reach any particular result, for example, it can be used for the purpose of pleasure.
1.3.4.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.2.
1.3.4.3. Con: This places a restriction on women's rights and freedoms for the explicit purpose of--and only of--satisfying men.  The rights and freedoms of women cannot be based on what will please men as men have routinely objected to any significant change in women's rights based on some aspect of her biology. Biology supposedly made women incapable of higher education, rational thought, and many other things \(a good read on this is Nancy Tauna, _The Less Noble Sex\).
1.3.4.4. Con: This bears no relevance to women's rights and choices.
1.3.4.5. Con: Just because a behavior might fit with a theory of evolutionary biology does not mean that this behavior is moral, or that it should be solidified in law. If the point of society were to "increase gene production," things like eugenics would be moral. However, human society is complex enough that many laws and social behaviors do not fit with evolutionary biology, but instead allow for happiness, freedom and fulfillment of human beings.
1.3.4.6. Con: This argument implies that a woman's body and choices belong to her male partner. This assumption is legally and culturally unfounded.
1.3.5. Con: This reinforces the idea that nudity is an inherently sexual thing, which is exactly the mindset that advocates for eliminating nipple restrictions are trying to change.
1.3.5.1. Con: Restriction is associated with nudity in a global mindset, in order for the restriction to change, global mindset should change first.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: No good reason is given why this should be the case.
1.3.5.1.2. Con: The claim attacks the premise of the attack on how it achieves it's goals without giving a better alternative.
1.3.5.2. Con: Nudity is sexually arousing not only because of culture, but also because of biology.
1.3.5.3. Con: Nudity is inherently sexual thing, because it is natural to have sex naked. Therefore avoiding nudity leads to giving less sexual message.
1.3.5.4. Pro: Many [nudists](http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/2015/06/why_be_naked.html) find that nudity gives them an unmatched sense of freedom and even makes them feel more connected to nature. This is a more positive attitude to promote than one where people, specifically women, should feel obligated to keep their natural bodies hidden.
1.3.6. Con: Men do not preserve their nudity for their partners by covering their nipples in public, therefore women should not be expected to either.
1.3.6.1. Pro: If a woman "should" have to preserve her nudity for her partner, so should a man. Gender inequality is created by stating that one gender should do something but not applying it to the other gender, especially in an arbitrary term such as "nudity".
1.3.6.2. Con: There is a cultural history attached to which body parts are considered sexual on men and women, while this may or may not be factually arbitrary, it is entrenched.  And disregarding long-held norms may cause discomfort to certain \(potentially older\) persons in the culture.
1.3.6.2.1. Con: This is not valid reasoning when distinguishing rights.
1.3.6.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.1.4.3.1.2.2.1.1.1.
1.3.6.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.2.2.
1.3.7. Pro: Christianity, a religion adopted by [70%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States) of Americans, holds the belief that nudity and sex should be reserved for husbands and their wives.
1.3.7.1. Pro: Indeed, the US and most of Europe are highly influenced by Christian moral values, and in some cases form the foundational principles of judiciary and social ideals.
1.3.7.1.1. Con: Of the [two sets of 10 Commandments](http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/Ten_c.htm), the [613 Laws and Commandments](http://www.gods-word-first.org/bible-study/613commandments.html) of the Old Testament, and [1,050 Commandments](https://www.cai.org/bible-studies/1050-new-testament-commands) in the New Testament, [only two are shared by US Laws](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2010/06/08/are_the_ten_commandments_really_the_basis_for_our_laws.html): "[Thou shalt not murder](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111)" and "[Thou shalt not steal](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-31)". "[Thou shalt not bear false witness](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/4101)" can only be counted if "[while under oath in a court of law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621)" were added to it. Please also compare with [The Constitution​](http://constitutionus.com/).
1.3.7.1.2. Pro: Christian men would find it much harder to refrain from "looking at a woman lustfully" \([Matthew 5:28](http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-28.htm)\).
1.3.7.1.2.1. Pro: This is arguably a good thing for Christian men as it would make it significantly easier to discern suitable Christian partner prospects from those who are not.
1.3.7.1.2.2. Con: Most historical [religions](https://www.onfaith.co/onfaith/2007/01/19/religious-restrictions-on-wome/3359) are concerned with how men are affected by [women](https://www.onfaith.co/onfaith/2007/01/19/religious-restrictions-on-wome/3359), claiming some 'male uncontrollable weakness' thus infantilizing them. The burden of men's actions should not on women but men, as they are the only ones responsible for their acts.
1.3.7.2. Con: One's beliefs are not themselves an argument.
1.3.7.3. Con: Other religions do not hold such views. In Paganism, nudity is celebrated as natural, and is often used in rituals under the term "being [skyclad](http://witchesandpagans.com/paganism-101/introduction-to-paganism/250-all-about-skyclad-nw14.html)". One should not be pressured into adhering to the morals of a religion they do not follow.
1.3.7.4. Con: Nudity and sex being reserved for one's spouse is not necessarily a Christian belief. Many of the early protagonists of naturism were Christians would perceived a gap between scripture and Victorian era modesty.[Christian Naturism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_naturism)
1.3.7.5. Con: Women are only mentioned in the Bible in a versicle by [Ezekiel](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/words/Nipples) about prostitutes in Egypt, yet the Bible directly does not command men or women to cover up their nipples.
1.3.7.5.1. Pro: There are many instances in the Bible that mention [nudity](http://www.religioustolerance.org/nu_bibl.htm). When the Bible is interpreted and translated as accurately as possible, it seems that nudity is not seen negatively nor it is condemned.
1.3.7.5.1.1. Pro: Nudity in the Bible is only [condemned](http://www.religioustolerance.org/nu_bibl.htm) when it is forced upon someone; when is associated with a sinful act or when the lack of clothing is part a larger context in which humans lack basic needs.
1.3.7.5.1.2. Con: Some interpretations consider that nudity mainly appears in the Bible in [sinful](https://www.gotquestions.org/Christian-nudist.html) contexts therefore Christians should not participate in nudism.
1.3.7.6. Con: Religious choices should not be imposed upon the other 30%.
1.3.7.7. Con: The United States is not a theocracy and its law does not have to follow Christian teachings.
1.3.7.7.1. Con: Its a part of the duty of a nation government to make moral and just laws. Most of which are derived from religious practice.
1.3.7.7.1.1. Con: Morality doesn't come from religion. Individuals might have an [instinctive morality](https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/05/why-its-obvious-that-morality-precedes-religion/) whispering that kindness to others is good in itself.
1.3.7.7.2. Pro: The US is also comprised of a lot of people who do not adhere to any [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_the_United_States) and that number is [increasing](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/01/10-facts-about-atheists/).
1.3.7.7.3. Pro: Christianity also believes that abortion is a sin. Yet, the US law permits abortion.
1.3.7.7.3.1. Con: The Federal Government is [attacking](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/types-attacks) the right to have abortions in [many ways](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/abortion/federal-and-state-bans-and-restrictions-abortion), often making it all but impossible to end a pregnancy.
1.3.7.7.4. Pro: Most laws in the US are not made on the basis of Christian beliefs, but rather what is most appropriate for the overall well-being of its residents.
1.3.7.7.4.1. Pro: The 70% of Americans who identify as Christians still retain the right to decide which of the tenets of that religion they will choose to to follow. And the 30% \(or more\) who do not identify as such should not be constrained by that religions rules.
1.3.7.8. Con: Religious women are still free to choose to maintain their modesty if that is what they value. It is unclear why their beliefs should be imposed across the rest of society.
1.3.7.8.1. Pro: Individual religious beliefs are not a sufficient reason to ban nipples from a community, considering that everyone can still behave according to their own beliefs.
1.3.7.9. Con: Many believers do not take scriptures literally.
1.3.7.9.1. Pro: [Many people​](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1802108/) have premarital sex.
1.3.7.9.2. Pro: We should weigh religious teachings against our own line of reasoning before accepting them. Religious texts are several hundreds of years old and they normally do not undergo updates to accommodate modern views as our knowledge and attitudes towards things change.
1.3.7.9.3. Pro: Only [twenty-four percent](http://www.gallup.com/poll/210704/record-few-americans-believe-bible-literal-word-god.aspx) of Americans believe Bible scriptures are the literal word of God.
1.3.8. Con: The valuation of sexual preservation is based in deep-rooted religious moral beliefs. Since the US Constitution advocates separation of church and state, it would be wrong to force these beliefs on everyone.
1.3.8.1. Con: The US Constitution doesn't advocate for [separation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Hy306pGmU) of church and state. Except in the case of state-sponsoring of religious institutions.
1.3.8.1.1. Con: The first Amendment of the [Constitution](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992) of the United States of America states that no law respecting an establishment of religion shall be made, which means no religion based laws.
1.3.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.7.2.
1.3.8.3. Pro: This attitude is rooted in narratives of chastity and monogamy and shames women who do not want to have a long-term committed relationship or who have multiple partners.
1.3.8.3.1. Con: The relationship does not have to be long-term or monogamous, as long as her nudity is restricted to her partner\(s\) and not in public.
1.3.8.3.1.1. Con: However, conservative attitudes towards nudity and sex, often include negative attitudes towards promiscuity.
1.3.8.3.2. Pro: A woman may not have a partner.
1.3.8.3.3. Pro: This generates a sex-negative culture wherein a woman's value is determined by her chastity.
1.3.8.3.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.
1.3.8.4. Con: Some people may have a religious motivation for believing in modesty regarding nudity, but no such motivation is inherent here. The rule is secular. Adopting the rule doesn't elevate or diminish any religion over another, unless you can name a religion that requires public nipple showing for women.
1.3.8.5. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.3.3.4.
1.3.9. Pro: Saving nudity for the bedroom can greatly enrich intimate relationships by making them feel more special.
1.3.9.1. Con: It might be true that saving nudity for the bedroom enriches intimate relationships, but that does not mean the government should make that decision for the individual.
1.3.9.1.1. Pro: Couples that feel saving nudity for the bedroom is important will still be able to do it. Other couples might feel differently about this, or might feel that the freedom to go out topless outweighs the benefit of saving nudity for the bedroom. It's about freedom to choose either way.
1.3.9.2. Con: Not relegating nudity to the bedroom, could lead to deeper, less superficial, and more enduring concepts of intimacy, thus leading to stronger relationships.
1.3.9.3. Con: This is a personal choice, not a reason to restrict nudity.
1.3.9.4. Con: For some couples, having sex outside can also enrich a relationship, and makes it much more special than regular bedroom sex.
1.3.9.5. Pro: For some highly religious couples, preserving nudity and sexuality for intimate activities is a way for them to feel closer to their god\(s\).
1.3.9.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.7.
1.3.9.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.7.8.1.
1.3.9.6. Pro: Due to prevailing negative social attitudes about promiscuity, some people will have more respect for women who save nudity for the bedroom.
1.3.9.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.1.1.2.1.
1.3.9.6.2. Con: Those negative attitudes \(which are usually used against women\) are the ones that need changing.
1.3.9.6.3. Con: Women, as human beings with rights, should be respected regardless of what they wear or how many partners they have.
1.3.9.7. Pro: If nudity is saved for the bedroom, then it will be appreciated more by one's partner because it feels like an earned reward.
1.3.9.7.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.
1.3.9.7.2. Con: It is not the federal government's job to enforce how partners appreciate each other.
1.3.9.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.
1.3.9.7.4. Con: A relationship that commoditises the body and its nudity as a reward may be harmful to women as it reinforces the notion that they are sexual objects for male consumption.
1.3.9.7.4.1. Con: Commoditization implies adding economic value to a good; although health and sex is a human good, bodies as rewards for partners doesn´t imply explicit money transactions or contracts.
1.3.9.7.4.1.1. Con: This does not change the fact that viewing only female nudity as a commodity or reward is detrimental to the equality of the sexes.
1.3.9.7.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.8.1.
1.3.9.7.4.3. Con: This assumes that all relationships are heterosexual. Lesbian couples might appreciate an agreement to only be nude with their partners as well.
1.3.9.7.4.3.1. Con: Commodification of nudity as a reward can still be prejudicial for women regardless of their partner's gender.
1.3.9.8. Con: If saving nudity for the bedroom enriches relationships, then male nudity should equally be restricted.
1.3.10. Con: -> See 1.3.5.4.
1.4. Con: Women showing their nipples in public is detrimental to society as a whole.
1.4.1. Pro: One of the benefits of standardizing clothing is to reduce oversexualization in culture. Given that it helps many of us need to wear something, we should stick with the old agreement to wear clothing including shirts.
1.4.1.1. Con: Standardized clothing doesn't reduce oversexualization because less permissive [countries](https://thenextweb.com/market-intelligence/2015/03/24/who-are-the-biggest-consumers-of-online-porn/) are among the biggest consumers of pornographic content online.
1.4.1.2. Con: The United States produce [a quarter of the online adult traffic in the world](https://thenextweb.com/market-intelligence/2015/03/24/who-are-the-biggest-consumers-of-online-porn/)
1.4.1.3. Con: The standard expectations of what is sexualized clothing changes regularly, from bare Roman breasts, to ankles being lewd, to microskirts being legally acceptable.  There is too much inconsistency to use that as the basis of a law that can impact someone financially and criminally.
1.4.2. Con: No society ever collapsed because of women showing their nipples.
1.4.3. Con: Breasts are not implicitly sexual. So any restriction on the display of breasts is based on sociological mores which are malleable.  Therefore there is no explicit reason why women should not be able to show their nipples
1.4.4. Pro: Showing female bare breasts in public is as much a sexual display as showing anyones' unclothed buttocks in regards of it's erogenous and visually provoking category, or showing [a man's testicles](http://theweek.com/articles/561537/why-feminists-are-fighting-losing-battle-over-boobs) as they are also largely visible sex distinguishing glands.
1.4.4.1. Con: It has not been shown that sexual displays harm society.
1.4.4.1.1. Con: The need to expose the most [sexually suggestive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_suggestiveness) body features in public is culturally called [exhibitionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibitionism#cite_note-baunach-1) which is also [categorized](https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/exhibitionistic-disorder-dsm--5-302.4-\(f-65.3\)) as a mental disorder manifesting narcisistic and/or sociopathic drives, by allowing it we are promoting those drives which are harmful to individuals and society.
1.4.4.1.1.1. Con: That a behavior can in some cases be symptomatic of a psychological disorder is not a valid reason to make that behavior illegal.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Manifesting psychological symptoms should not be illegal, although glamorizing those symptoms by advertising them as symbols of protest could be; just like misogyny, psychological neoteny and depression \(and also suicide and psychopathy\) should not be glamorized in music or tv.
1.4.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con: Although it should not be glamorized, it is not illegal to do so.
1.4.4.1.1.1.2. Pro: For example, talking nonsensically to oneself in public can be a symptom of paranoid schizophrenia, but is not and should not be illegal.
1.4.4.1.1.2. Con: Wanting to be topless to sunbath or to feed a child, common situations in which women are topless in countries without restrictions, does not seem to be exhibitionistic disorder.
1.4.4.1.1.3. Con: The American Psychiatric Association \(APA\) classifies the condition of Exhibitionistic Disorder as exposing "one’s [genitals](https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/exhibitionistic-disorder-dsm--5-302.4-\(f-65.3\)) to other people" and it also concludes that the majority of exhibitionists are males.
1.4.4.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.2.1.1.
1.4.4.1.1.5. Con: The DSM used to consider homosexuality as a disorder. Meaning that what they classify as a disorder can't define the disorder itself, it is a reflection of our understanding of what a disorder is. If we come to agree that nipples aren't considered genitals, then the DSM must change.
1.4.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.
1.4.4.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.
1.4.4.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.1.
1.4.4.5. Con: String bikinis are allowed, which show a person's bare buttocks.
1.4.4.6. Con: The only valid comparison to male testicles are females ovaries, as they too are specific sex glands. Breasts are not, and their only valid comparison are male's breasts.
1.4.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.1.1.
1.4.6. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.4.
1.4.7. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.3.
1.4.8. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.8.
1.4.9. Pro: A woman's nipples are more distracting than a man's.
1.4.9.1. Pro: Just imagine walking into a class filled with shirtless guys with perfect abs, and trying to concentrate on your studies. This can easily be compared to as if a guy walked in a room filled with bra-less girls. It's not sexual harassment, it's called sexual tension. In simpler words girls would feel the same way a guy would in different but similar circumstances.
1.4.9.2. Con: Men can be distracted by a woman's sexuality \(and, in fairness, the other way around as well\) with or without clothing. A full concealment garment can still evoke a sexual response based on factors having nothing to do with nipples. The fact that a state of dress might distract people should not be a consideration on its legality.
1.4.9.2.1. Pro: Men respond more quickly and deeply to  [visual sexual cues](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/03/040316072953.htm) than women. Free the nipple campaigners must be aware of this, and that nipples might signal fertility and availability cues to every male with line of sight, without their [consent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPQH0U2igOY).  This makes free the nipple a campaign to freely harass strangers sexually.
1.4.9.2.1.1. Con: The right not to be aroused is significantly less important than the rights to free expression, and autonomy that would need to be sacrificed to maintain it.
1.4.9.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.4.9.2.1.1.2. Con: Uncovering breasts to not consenting strangers is not a form of self expression unless the woman has modified her breasts through some form of art which [could make the display legal](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/explainer/2013/03/body_painting_does_it_run_afoul_of_public_nudity_laws.html) in most states; breast surgeries and piercing could be considered self expression but as those forms of expression can entail sexual innuendo, is it reasonable to censour their display in public to protect social order, unless there is mutual consent on the parts for not doing it.
1.4.9.2.1.1.2.1. Con: As discussed in [that same article](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/explainer/2013/03/body_painting_does_it_run_afoul_of_public_nudity_laws.html), nudity is a form of free expression that has been recognized by local police.
1.4.9.2.1.2. Con: This argument works equally well for forcing women to fully cover every inch of their bodies. We have generally agreed this is not the case.
1.4.9.3. Con: Gender-based nipple restrictions are discriminatory towards transgender women, who are held to a different standard since society cannot seem to figure out at what point breasts become "[unlawfully erogenous](https://www.bustle.com/articles/61199-how-transgender-women-make-topless-laws-look-even-more-ridiculous-and-offensive-than-we-already-knew)".
1.4.9.3.1. Con: Female torsos are culturally considered more sexually suggestive and requiring caution when addressed \(a trasgender torso with breasts would pass as a female torso\), which instead of being genderist could be atributted to breasts being attractive to [both men and women](https://www.maxim.com/maxim-man/women-love-boobs-study-2016-8) and also nipples being a [trigger of oxytocine which is higher in women and is related to intimate feelings and bonding.](https://hypericum.wordpress.com/tag/oxytocin-male-breast-nipple/)
1.4.9.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.4.1.3.
1.4.9.3.3. Con: This is not targeted discrimination against transgender women. Rather, this policy acknowledges them as women by making them adhere to the same policy standards as women in general.
1.4.9.3.3.1. Con: This misses the point. It is wrong to define an arbitrary line where the bodies of transgender women are suddenly "female enough" to be called "women".
1.4.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.
1.4.9.5. Pro: A woman's breasts are not comparable to a man's chest. Basic biological differences between a man and woman cannot be denied.
1.4.9.5.1. Con: It is socialisation, not biology, that makes women's chests more "distracting".
1.4.9.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.3.
1.4.9.5.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.5.

1.4.9.5.6. Con: -> See 1.4.9.3.
1.4.9.5.7. Con: As women are largely allowed to show their breasts but not nipples, this is specifically about restrictions on nipple showing. Close up, it is often very difficult to identify whether a [nipple](http://www.revelist.com/dating/genderless-nipples/6549) is male or female.
1.4.9.5.7.1. Con: While the core of the issue is indeed specific to the nipple, the taboo nature of a particular nipple is distinguished from whether it is attached to a male chest or a female breast. As such, breasts are an important part of the discussion too.
1.4.9.5.7.2. Con: The social taboo is generally about breasts, not nipples. The boundary has simply moved over the years as the breast has no clear border and thus women have for centuries played with just how much can be shown without breaking the taboo \(following medieval fashion is a good teacher here\). The nipple serves as the one clear boundary that can be treated in a binary fashion \(visible or not\).
1.4.9.5.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.3.
1.4.9.5.8. Pro: Discrimination occurs when two different things of equal value are not treated equally. This is not the case as a woman's breasts are not comparable to a man's chest.
1.4.9.5.8.1. Con: It is not clear how men's nipples differ in value from woman's.
1.4.9.5.8.1.1. Pro: Everyone has nipples. And most of the times, you can't tell the difference [if you look closer.](https://www.instagram.com/genderless_nipples/)
1.4.9.5.8.2. Con: They do not need to be of equal value, as [discrimination](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/discrimination) is also 'the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people, especially age, race, or sex.'
1.4.9.5.8.2.1. Con: They do need to be of equal value, otherwise it is not unjust. It would be okay to give man a 10 year jail sentence and a woman a 1 year jail sentence if the man committed murder and the woman committed assault, it would be unfair if they had committed the same crime. It is not [prejudice](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/prejudice) because it is based on the reason that the female nipple is more eregeonous than that of a man.
1.4.9.5.8.3. Pro: Women have higher levels of estrogen than men, producing visually larger breasts.
1.4.9.5.8.3.1. Con: The breast itself is not the object of concern or censorship, a bare breast with a concealed nipple for women is legal. As we do not currently restrict the breast, the size of the organ is irrelevant.
1.4.9.5.8.3.2. Con: Size alone is not a compelling reason to require an organ's concealment by law.
1.4.9.5.8.3.2.1. Pro: The size of a woman's breasts bares no inherent meaning without first the meaning society has assigned to body part.
1.4.9.5.8.3.3. Con: This is not always the case, as many women have small breasts.
1.4.9.5.8.3.3.1. Con: Even small breasts can be visibly distinguishable from a man's chests.
1.4.9.5.8.3.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.9.5.7.
1.4.9.5.8.3.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.4.3.
1.4.9.5.8.3.4. Con: Men have higher levels of testosterone than women, producing larger muscles - which a large portion of women find sexually arousing. This does not mean that men should be banned from showing muscles.
1.4.9.5.8.3.5. Con: Some women diagnosed with breast cancer have their breasts removed, but they’re still not allowed to go shirtless.
1.4.9.5.8.3.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.
1.4.9.5.8.3.6. Con: [Men](http://www.differencebetween.net/science/health/difference-between-gynecomastia-and-chest-fat/) often have enlarged breasts due either to gynecomastia or to increased fat deposits in their chest as a result of being overweight, yet they are still allowed to reveal their nipples in public.
1.4.9.5.8.3.6.1. Con: A [photo](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/nipple-not-just-nipple/) of a male's chest was recently censored due to gynecomastia. Only the side resembling a female's enlarged nipple and breast was blurred, while the side resembling a male's natural chest remained untouched.
1.4.9.5.8.3.6.1.1. Con: Although the photo was blurred, the man was clearly in public without a shirt and was allowed to do so regardless. The article also seems to mock the attempt at censoring the enlarged nipple but not the other, suggesting doing so is a faux pas.
1.4.9.5.8.3.6.2. Con: Gynecomastia doesn´t have a sexual connotation since enlarged breasts in men are not intended for appealing and enticing the opposite sex.
1.4.9.5.8.4. Con: -> See 1.4.9.5.7.
1.4.9.5.8.5. Con: According to [Rawls' political theory](https://www.academia.edu/20907784/Free_the_Nipple) of justice \(p.4\), men and women should be treated equally under the rule of law when they expose their naked upper body.
1.4.9.5.8.6. Con: The same argument could be made about skin: a type I in the [Fitzpatrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale) scale \(very pale\) is not the same as a type VI \(most pigmentation\) yet that should not be an argument to discriminate or restrict the exposition of one versus the other.
1.4.9.5.8.6.1. Con: Skin pigmentation is not sexual characteristic. Breasts are a secondary sexual characteristic and have different biological and evolutionary drivers.
1.4.9.5.8.6.1.1. Con: A secondary sexual characteristic is simply one carried on the genes primary responsible for determining one's sex. Height is in part a secondary sexual characteristic, but it's hard to argue we should disguise that.
1.4.9.5.8.6.1.1.1. Con: This claim is a non-sequitur, as the point it hopes to rebut is that skin pigmentation and secondary sexual characteristics are equivalent.
1.4.9.5.8.6.1.2. Con: Some people express the gene, others do not, just like with every other genetic characteristic.
1.4.9.5.9. Con: -> See 1.4.9.5.8.3.5.

1.4.9.5.12. Con: -> See 1.1.4.4.1.
1.4.9.6. Con: This is not a reason for banning their exposure. Many people have distinctive or distracting bodily features, however, we do not insist that they cover themselves up.
1.4.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.5.8.3.6.
1.4.9.7. Pro: Allowing women to show their nipples could cause accidents.
1.4.9.7.1. Con: Women should not be punished for others choosing to stare at their bodies.
1.4.9.7.2. Con: The same is true for men with exposed nipples. Both women and those attracted to men may become distracted as well.
1.4.9.7.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.4.3.7.
1.4.9.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.2.
1.4.9.7.5. Pro: Bare-breasted women would get much more attention from drivers and others using dangerous equipment.
1.4.9.7.5.1. Pro: Two-thirds of male drivers admit to being [distracted](http://www.saga.co.uk/newsroom/press-releases/2013/august/mens-motoring-manoeuvres-suffer-with-sight-of-higher-hemlines.aspx?pid=ppaw&scid=aff|trv|0|na|Skimlinks|78888|&_$ja=tsid:71488|cgn:57697|kw:Skimlinks&awc=6516_1490640231_fb93ce0735a6d3ea42929224993e12ff&awc=6516_1490640231_fb93ce0735a6d3ea42929224993e12ff) behind the wheel, with 30 percent being distracted by what they see. Seeing a bare-breasted woman would undoubtedly cause a distraction, and a potential accident.
1.4.9.7.5.2. Pro: A woman's exposed nipples may be a life-threatening distraction to individuals operating heavy machinery, such as construction workers.
1.4.9.7.5.2.1. Con: It is unfair to make women responsible for some people's inability to remain focused while on the job.
1.4.9.7.5.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.3.
1.4.9.7.5.4. Con: Billboards, sports cars, and cyclists are just a few examples of things that are [highly distracting](http://www.insurancehunter.ca/blog/inside-and-outside-car-looking-countless-dangerous-driving-distractions) to drivers yet are not banned. Nipples should be no different.
1.4.9.8. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.9.

1.4.10. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.15.
1.4.11. Con: In the 1930s, men’s nipples were considered [just as taboo](http://hellogiggles.com/sexualize-nipples-anyway/) as women’s nipples.
1.4.11.1. Con: The issue of male nipple exposure only received a [brief burst of press](http://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/blogs/how-american-men-won-the-right-to-go-topless.htm) in the late 1930s, and the right to reveal them was swiftly won thereafter. The fact that the issue of female nipple exposure is so much more contentious stands as evidence that the two are not equal.
1.4.11.1.1. Con: If anything, the fact that the same argument for the same right is more contentious for women than for men is the the definition of sex-based discrimination.
1.4.11.1.2. Con: The contentiousness of restricting female nipple exposure is due to the patriarchal position of US society, as women's issues have historically been met with male opposition.
1.4.11.1.2.1. Con: Although 58% of Americans polled are in favor of gender restrictions, [more men](https://today.yougov.com/news/2014/05/13/toplessness/) think it is acceptable for women to go topless in public than do women.
1.4.11.1.2.1.1. Pro: Women are just as much the victims of social constructs and bias as men are, and this is not an issue of what men think vs. what women think. Women can just as easily hold the same outdated opinions on this subject as a man, and be equally as wrong.
1.4.11.1.2.2. Pro: Women had to fight for nearly 100 years for their [right to vote](http://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/the-fight-for-womens-suffrage), although there is no difference between male and female votes.
1.4.11.1.3. Con: The [decision](http://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/blogs/how-american-men-won-the-right-to-go-topless.htm) to allow male nipple exposure was heavily influenced by male law enforcement officials and judges who could personally empathize with male body politics. Since these positions are still mostly occupied by men, one can assume that female nipple restrictions are due to a lack of female power in the political system, not because their nipples are different from those of a man.
1.4.12. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.2.
1.4.13. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.
1.4.14. Con: Normalizing nudity cannot be detrimental to society. On the contrary, it would be beneficial for society as a whole.
1.4.14.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.2.
1.4.14.2. Pro: Nipple showing helps people in gaining body and health awareness.
1.4.14.2.1. Pro: A repressed attitude towards nudity and sexuality results in [high teen pregnancy rate.](http://www.thebody.com/content/art29434.html)
1.4.14.2.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.5.
1.4.14.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.4.
1.4.14.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.6.
1.4.14.3. Pro: Allowing nipple showing means taking another step towards the balance of power between genders.
1.4.14.3.1. Pro: It is discriminatory to restrict women and not men.
1.4.14.3.1.1. Pro: Women, like men, should be able to go topless when and where ever fits appropriate, but should expect to get looks, like a man also would.
1.4.14.3.1.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.6.
1.4.14.3.1.1.2. Con: The public may not be ready to see a topless woman in public.
1.4.14.3.1.1.2.1. Con: The right to walk topless doesn't mean obligation. If society would prove to be not ready, women simply would not use this right.
1.4.14.3.1.2. Con: Men are also restricted to cover the parts of their body that are considered sexual \(creates a biological response when viewed\), but that doesn't mean women are discriminated against.
1.4.14.3.1.2.1. Con: Men only get that biological response because they have been brought up with it being that way. If it were commonplace, they would not get that response.
1.4.14.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Male monkeys pull leavers to see pictures of  in season female monkeys. Male dogs go crazy when they smell a bitch in heat. Male spiders risk being eaten alive. To assume a species' sexual reaction are social constructs is ignoring biology.
1.4.14.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: It is also biologically ignorant to equate animals instinctive reaction to pheromones and signs of oestrus with the social hypersexualization of a nonsexual organ and consequently banning it from view.
1.4.14.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The fact that reaction to pheromones and oestrus is the same among all members of the species, but human choice of organs to hypersexualize is not, is a perfectly good reason to attribute the latter to social constructs.
1.4.14.3.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: If it were true that arousal by seeing or having any body part touched was easily 100% learnable and a choice, there would be people paying to learn how to make other body parts arousing, as arousal [is a highly profitable](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2649-sex-sells-more.html) thing to advertise or use in advertising. \(e.g. there would be a porn industry devoted to teaching you how to make other body parts arousing, watch makers would have made wrists arousing, earring makers would've made ears arousing, ...etc\).
1.4.14.3.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Although teaching this is not easy, advertisers have tried to make everything, even [burgers](http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/sns-health-fast-food-sexualization-story.html), sexy.
1.4.14.3.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.1.2.1.2.
1.4.14.3.1.2.1.2. Con: That biological response come from not only prohibition of showing bare chest for women, but also from the fact that vast majority of men see woman breast as one of most important body part during sex.
1.4.14.3.1.2.2. Pro: Men cannot expose their penises in public without censure and arrest.
1.4.14.3.1.2.2.1. Con: Women can't expose their vaginas either. These are equal restrictions, and are equally appropriate/inappropriate.
1.4.14.3.1.2.2.2. Con: This is a false comparison, this point has one example, and it applies equally to females, but for other points such as the censorship of woman's nipples, the invasion of there rights, privacy, and sometimes even safety regarding the question of birth, and other acts against them have no such equivalency.
1.4.14.3.1.2.3. Con: Different people consider different anatomical forms to be sexual. Biological arousal can emerge from form-fitting clothing, facial characteristics, or curvature of non-sexual organs. Men are not required to cover up every inch of their body, nor are they required to wear baggy clothing to prevent arousal.
1.4.14.3.1.2.3.1. Con: While it is true - vast majority of men find women breasts highly sexual, while other parts of body \(of those not restricted to be shown\) are seen as less sexual by most.
1.4.14.3.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.4.5.1.
1.4.14.3.1.2.5. Pro: [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16681470) found that in 301 subjects 82% of women but only 52% of men found stimulation of nipples/breasts to increase arousal, pointing to nipples being biologically more important to female sexuality.
1.4.14.3.1.2.5.1. Con: The link shown is observable, but that does not necessitate it being biological, such behavior could very easily be learned.
1.4.14.3.1.2.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.
1.4.14.3.1.2.5.1.2. Con: If nipple stimulation is learned, then unstimulated virgin women should not experience sexual arousal or have especially sensitive nipples.
1.4.14.3.1.2.5.1.2.1. Con: It does not have to be learned through experience, the social expectation that women should be aroused by nipple stimulation is enough to cause learned behavior.
1.4.14.3.1.2.5.1.3. Con: -> See 1.4.14.3.1.2.1.1.3.
1.4.14.3.1.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.1.3.
1.4.14.3.1.2.6. Con: Men are not required to cover the parts of their body that create a biological response when viewed - only the groin area itself. In contrast, many other parts of a man's body \(muscular chest, broad shoulders, calves, etc.\) are considered sexually arousing, yet do not require covering.
1.4.14.3.1.2.7. Con: Even if the same standard is being applied \(areas that illicit a sexual response must be covered\), it is clear that women face a higher burden to meet that standard than men. The choice of standard itself is discriminatory.
1.4.14.3.1.3. Pro: There are many places that men cannot or should not be topless, thus the same ethic would apply to women; the notion that society would devolve into topless women running around is insulting to the self-respect of many women, and the boundaries already in place on topless men.
1.4.14.3.1.4. Pro: A woman could wear a bathing suit with a naked male torso printed on it, whereas man could not wear bathing suit with a naked female torso printed on it. Judging the same situation with switched sexes or genders differently is considered as sexism, or genderism.
1.4.14.3.1.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.9.3.1.
1.4.14.3.1.5. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.3.
1.4.14.3.1.6. Con: Equality in general is not as reasonable a goal as equity regarding such deeply diffferentiated groups as the sexes; because it would also require the right for men to not be primarily scouted for military service, having long paternity licenses, be considered priority in emergency assistance and children custody litigations, having specific health programs directed at them and socially considering any form of aggresion against them as serious, all of which would be too difficult to achieve.
1.4.14.3.1.6.1. Pro: Female nipple restriction although unequal, can be considered a form of equity if we acknowledge the difference in function, constitution, shape and social sexualization of male and female chests.
1.4.14.3.1.6.1.1. Con: The differences in function, constitution, shape and social sexualization of male and female chests and the banning of one over the other thereof, has nothing to do with equity.
1.4.14.3.1.6.2. Con: The right for men to not be primarily scouted for military service, having long paternity licenses, be considered priority in health services, emergency assistance and children custody litigations, and having any form of aggresion against them be considered a violent crime, are all doable things that we should pursue doing.
1.4.14.3.1.6.3. Con: Women and men have fought to achieve more equality already. For example, in many countries, women have conquered the right to serve in the [military](http://www.history.org/history/teaching/enewsletter/volume7/images/nov/women_military_timeline.pdf); many laws have increased or equated maternal and paternal [leave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave#Paternity_leave_and_its_effects) and, although children's custody is still [often](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/cathy-meyer/dispelling-the-myth-of-ge_b_1617115.html) given to women \(as they are still the primary care givers\), [joint custody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_custody) is now more common than years ago.
1.4.14.3.1.6.4. Con: Although all of these should be the goal, none of them have anything to do with whether women should be banned from showing the same body parts as men.
1.4.14.3.1.7. Pro: In a liberal society, women \(and men\) should have the freedom to wear as little or as much as they please. Instead of implementing regulation to govern morality, let the fluidity of societal norms be the determinant of what's acceptable.
1.4.14.3.1.8. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.5.
1.4.14.3.1.9. Pro: Women have only been restricted due to a sexist taboo that naked women's bodies must be overtly sexualized whereas men's bodies are not in the same regard. This is why men may show their nipples in situations where women cannot, due to this overt and inherent sexualization of women. Thus, it is unjust to not allow women to show the same part of their body as men.
1.4.14.3.1.10. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.3.
1.4.14.3.1.11. Pro: Breasts are secondary sexual characteristics, like a beard or an Adam's apple on a man. So if men wear turtlenecks all the time, then there's equality.
1.4.14.3.1.12. Pro: Nipple restrictions only encourage inequality amongst both men and women.
1.4.14.3.1.13. Con: -> See 1.4.9.5.8.
1.4.14.3.1.14. Pro: -> See 1.2.10.4.
1.4.14.3.1.15. Pro: In 1936, [men](http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1936/06/29/page/1/article/shirtless-bathing-brings-protest-on-hairy-chested-men) fought for the right to swim topless and won. To not grant women the same rights is wrong and discriminatory.
1.4.14.3.1.15.1. Con: Men's bodies were not sexualised in the same way that women's are.
1.4.14.3.1.15.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.9.
1.4.14.3.1.15.1.2. Con: If it were women in charge of legislation at the time, they might have. Men do not have the right to first decide that a female body part is sexual, and then use that decision to ban it from public display.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2. Con: Men broke the law in the late 30s for being topless. Rather than allowing women to bypass laws as well, we should reinforce laws of public decency that were broken then to encourage everyone equally to wear all their clothes.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.1. Con: The law against male toplessness was changed.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.2. Con: Decency is a construct relative to each individual.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.3. Con: The 1930s were almost 100 years ago. Any move back would have happened by now, as would have any supposed moral decay.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.3.1. Con: Significant moral decay has [in fact happened](http://www.sciencemeetsreligion.org/philosophy/decline.php) since the 1930s.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.3.1.1. Pro: Divorce rate since 1930 has increased by[250%](http://divorce.lovetoknow.com/Historical_Divorce_Rate_Statistics)
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.3.1.1.1. Con: Being able to get a divorce is more moral than forcing people to stay in loveless and joyless, even sometimes abusive, unions.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.3.1.2. Pro: Premarital sex rate has drastically increased since [1930.](https://voxeu.org/article/premarital-sex-economic-model-its-rise-and-de-stigmatisation)
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.3.1.2.1. Con: The fact that men and especially women are free to have relationships \(including sex\) with different people, before deciding to freely marry, or not, is not inherently bad. On the contrary, it gives people more room to decide and choose an adequate and loving partner.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.3.1.3. Pro: The amount of profanity and sex in movies has steadily increased since the [1930s.](http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=masters)
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.3.1.3.1. Con: More freedom regarding sex, including abounding depictions of sex and nudity in movies and media, is a sign of progress, not moral decay.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.3.1.4. Con: People shrugging off antiquated rules from a bygone era erected for purposes that are no longer relevant is not moral decay.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.3.1.5. Con: Many people would say that the mixing of races, and women taking on the rules of men, while men take up housework that happened from that time is moral decay. Social perspectives change and cultural shifts that entail more freedom \(especially for oppressed groups\) are generally regarded as progress not moral decay.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.5.3.1.1.
1.4.14.3.1.15.2.5. Con: In the middle age, [the law](http://www.thefinertimes.com/Middle-Ages/law-in-the-middle-ages.html) said that the accused of a crime had to be thrown in a barrel full of cold water. If the accused drowned, he was considered guilty. On the other hand, if the accused swam and saved his life, he was considered to be innocent. Laws must be reviewed as society evolves.
1.4.14.3.1.15.3. Pro: Women should have the right to dress as they please. Although this can bring complications in our culture \(children exposed to nude breasts for the first time\) we have gone through similar issues when the same law changed for men.
1.4.14.3.1.15.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.
1.4.14.3.1.15.5. Con: -> See 1.4.11.1.
1.4.14.3.1.16. Pro: Nipple restrictions carry unfair legal repercussions for women, since revealing a female nipple is classified as [public indecency](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/columns/straight-dope/article/13045218/why-are-women-expected-to-keep-their-nipples-covered-breasts) and thus can be meted the same punishment as for having sex in public.
1.4.14.3.1.16.1. Pro: The 14th Amendment provides for equal protection under the law.  The problem is that up to this point the women who have stood to make the argument have no resources to fight this through the appellate process.  Perhaps the ACLU will take up this worthy fight.
1.4.14.3.1.16.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.3.
1.4.14.3.1.16.3. Con: Legal ramifications for showing nipples assume the conclusion of nipples being sexual/non-sexual prior to evaluating whether the law is just or unjust. We cannot assume legal punishment is unjust prior to evaluation of showing nipples.
1.4.14.3.1.17. Pro: Restricting women's bodies and not men's suggests that women should be ashamed of their bodies.
1.4.14.3.1.17.1. Con: Women can be just as ashamed of their bodies whether they may show their nipples or not; this is entirely based on self-perception and if they interpret censorship as a form of shaming. Therefore, restricting a women's ability to expose their nipples can exist without being a personal attack.
1.4.14.3.1.17.1.1. Con: There are many words defamatory to women. They reduce them to beasts, and things to have sex with. Saying women should just get more oppression by being forced to wear a top because they'd probably be uncomfortable anyway is like saying they should be fine with people using those words because they would probably be uncomfortable anyway. We've rejected this logic in the later case, and we should clearly also do so in the first case.
1.4.14.3.1.17.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.2.2.1.
1.4.14.3.1.17.2. Con: Women covering up was meant to impart a sense of sacredness, not shame.
1.4.14.3.1.17.2.1. Con: As it stands, the restrictions on women's bodies are not promoting sacredness. They are promoting shame.
1.4.14.3.1.17.2.1.1. Con: The failings of people to revere what is sacred does not impact the reality.
1.4.14.3.1.17.2.1.1.1. Con: What one thinks people are supposed to feel has no impact on reality, if people don't actually do it, then it is false.
1.4.14.3.1.17.2.1.1.2. Con: Hidden bodies are hidden. Hidden bodies should not be sacred.
1.4.14.3.1.17.2.1.2. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.4.14.3.1.17.2.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.2.
1.4.14.3.1.17.2.1.4. Pro: The idea of being secluded when doing certain activities \(eating, sleeping, having sex\) was for protection, and can also be observed in animals, as you don't want to be attacked in a moment you are doing something that prevents you from being vigilant. Then the advancement of society created the idea of shame for some of those 'secluded' activities and not for others.
1.4.14.3.1.17.2.1.5. Pro: [When we accept or “buy-in to” the negative and inferiorizing messages that are propagated about who we are, then we have begun to internalize the oppression that we experienced. We have come to learn that having certain traits, being a member of a particular group, and being who we are are not good enough or are not desirable. Sometimes, we even learn to hate our traits, our groups, ourselves.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/unseen-and-unheard/201509/internalized-oppression-we-need-stop-hating-ourselves)
1.4.14.3.1.17.2.1.5.1. Pro: Internalized oppression does not just affect a few individuals. Instead, internalized oppression can destroy families, cultures, and communities.
1.4.14.3.1.17.2.1.5.2. Pro: We also need to realize that the inferiorizing and dehumanizing messages about women that we propagate and allow to survive in our society also affect people's mental health.
1.4.14.3.1.17.2.1.5.2.1. Pro: Such messages distort their views of themselves and others. Distortion of reality can lead to harmful emotions \(e.g., hate\) toward one's self and others. Such distortions can lead to harmful, sometimes deadly, behaviors—both toward one's self \(e.g., suicide\) and toward others \(e.g., abuse of women\).
1.4.14.3.1.17.3. Con: -> See 1.1.4.3.
1.4.14.3.1.17.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.
1.4.14.3.1.18. Con: In some instances, gender discrimination is justifiable or even beneficial.
1.4.14.3.1.18.1. Con: Assuming this premise could be correct in general, there is no evidence that it applies in this specific instance.
1.4.14.3.1.18.2. Con: While differences between men and women exist and laws should reflect that, something as simple as the difference between men and women's nipples does not justify legal discrimination.
1.4.14.3.1.18.3. Con: Discrimination that restricts rather than uplifts is not justifiable or beneficial.
1.4.14.3.1.18.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.7.5.2.1.
1.4.14.3.1.18.5. Con: In such contexts it is not discrimination, but treating different on ground of stated truths.
1.4.14.3.1.18.6. Pro: [Female-only taxi](http://time.com/money/3305393/new-taxi-service-is-like-uber-but-for-women-only/) services, which refuse to service men if there isn't a female in the party, were created as a means to protect women from the very real threat of sexual harassment and assault.
1.4.14.3.1.18.6.1. Con: Actions meant to counterbalance inequality should not be seen as discrimination.
1.4.14.3.1.18.6.1.1. Con: While the effect does counterbalance inequality, differentiating or making any distinction between men and women is by definition discrimination.
1.4.14.3.1.18.6.1.2. Con: Fighting inequality with inequality perpetuates inequality.  It is a 'do something' response that leads to worse outcomes.
1.4.14.3.1.18.7. Pro: Young men pay [higher car insurance](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-adams/how-age-gender-and-marital-status-affect-your-car-insurance_b_6973360.html) rates than their female counterparts because, statistically speaking, they are more dangerous drivers. In this instance, discrimination is justified by data.
1.4.14.3.1.18.7.1. Con: It is arguable that this is not discrimination: they pay more because statistically young men have more accidents. Discrimination would be to make a group of people \(based on ethnicity, gender or identity\) pay more just because they are from that group.
1.4.14.3.1.18.8. Pro: Affirmative action, which some would argue is discriminatory towards those in the majority, has greatly [helped women](http://alltogether.swe.org/2017/03/equal-opportunity-affirmative-action-support-persistence-women-stem-2/) to establish a presence in fields like STEM where they have been historically underrepresented.
1.4.14.3.1.18.8.1. Con: Affirmative action is not comparable to the right to dress in a certain way.
1.4.14.3.1.18.8.2. Con: Yet affirmative action is designed precisely to counterbalance inequality and therefore cannot be regarded as discrimination.
1.4.14.3.1.18.9. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.
1.4.14.3.1.18.10. Con: Gender discrimination against women is historically more prevalent than with men. There is no justifiable reason for this inequality.
1.4.14.3.1.18.10.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.11.1.2.2.
1.4.14.3.1.18.10.2. Pro: Even thought the [pay gap](http://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/) between men and women has progressed since the 1970s, women are paid only 80 per cent of what men earn for the same job. This pay gap has not changed significantly since 2007.
1.4.14.3.1.18.11. Con: Much of this discrimination has only benefited men while disempowering women.
1.4.14.4. Pro: Men will no longer need to seek women's bodies as "prizes", because seeing women's breasts will be normal. This reduces aggressive behaviors.
1.4.14.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.
1.4.14.4.2. Pro: If nipple showing and nudity weren't a taboo, some crimes such as [hacking personal pictures](http://perezhilton.com/2017-03-16-celebrity-nude-photo-hacks-emma-watson-emma-stone-brie-larson) and videos would not cause harassment and pain to women.
1.5. Pro: Topless women have widely been an acceptable subject in popular and high culture, and in the media. It is hypocritical to treat female nudity any different in society.
1.5.1. Pro: Women are often the subjects used for nude art modeling for still life art courses.
1.5.2. Pro: A great number of the paintings and artwork that show nude and topless women are [done by men](http://www.naturistart.com/nude-art/). It is unfair that men should be free to portray women as topless but women are not free to be topless themselves.
1.5.2.1. Pro: Examples of topless women having been acceptable subjects in popular and high culture: [The birth of Venus \(nudity\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Venus) [La maja desnuda \(nudity\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_maja_desnuda)
1.5.2.2. Pro: The work of [male artists](https://nmwa.org/advocate/get-facts) make up more than 96% of the Modern Art section of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, and 76% of this art done is of nude females.
1.5.2.3. Con: Something painted is not equal in expression to something real, especially in sexual context.
1.5.2.4. Con: Women are as well free to portray topless women, even themselves.
1.5.2.5. Con: It is widely avoided to show paintings of nude women in public places other than museums etc.
1.5.2.5.1. Pro: Most countries allow nudity in magazines, but [have many restrictions](https://nfrnonline.com/news/guidance-on-displaying-adult-titles/), eg top shelf only, to prevent the younger public seeing it.
1.5.3. Pro: Museums across the US feature various statues and paintings with true-to-life topless or nude women, even though they are public family institutions.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Ten of the world's most [impactful nude paintings](http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/g7285/nudity-in-art-history/) feature women and are on public display in various museums.
1.5.4. Pro: Topless women are accepted if it is for the benefit of the male gaze, but unapproved when they're breastfeeding a child.
1.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.5.5.5.
1.5.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.2.2.1.
1.5.5. Pro: The restrictions on nipple-showing are out of date and irrelevant. Everyone knows what an uncovered breast looks like, these days.
1.5.5.1. Con: Most people knew how it looks like even decades ago due to breast feeding.
1.5.6. Con: There are many subjects that are acceptable in popular and high culture that are appropriately unacceptable in society.
1.5.6.1. Con: The objectionable acts shown in these paintings, such as bestiality are acts, doing something is very different from showing something, a live showing of bestiality requires the committing of bestiality, and showing it, but showing a breast in both cases is just showing a breast.This is comparing apples to apples and oranges.
1.5.6.2. Pro: Violent acts like murder or rape are acceptable subjects in art and entertainment, yet it is understood that they are not acceptable behaviors in society.
1.5.6.2.1. Con: Murder and rape are not acceptable in society as they are acts of inflicting physical harm. In contrast to that, the harm inflicted by nudity is purely a social construct.
1.5.6.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.1.
1.5.6.2.2. Pro: Historically, art has often portrayed rape as a heroic act carried out by Greek and Roman warriors or gods. These [visions](http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/arth/arth200/Heroic_Rape.html) “glorify, sanitize, and aestheticize sexual violence”.
1.5.6.2.2.1. Pro: The representation of [rape](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/g-roger-denson/facing-the-interior-and-t_b_1073672.html), quite common in Western art from ancient times to the 20th century, has been mainly made by men, with a few exceptions. Where images from Old Masters depict sexual violence as “aesthetic and dramatic action”, more recent female artists explore it as an ethical issue and from a psychological empathy perspective.
1.5.6.3. Pro: Some museums include depictions of bestiality, among other pornographic behaviors, which are considered unacceptable in society, but are broadly accepted when depicted as a form of art \(e.g. [The Secret Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Museum,_Naples) in Naples\).
1.5.6.3.1. Pro: Erotic or [pornographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography_in_the_United_States) images are legal in most liberal democracies, but that does not mean they are accepted as they would not be allowed if displayed publicly.
1.5.6.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.2.5.1.
1.5.6.3.1.2. Con: Museums are public premises \(often publicly owned\), and their exhibitions are opened to everyone.
1.5.6.3.1.2.1. Con: Some museums implement [age restrictions](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/jul/09/exhibitionagerestrictionstr) when their exhibitions include nudity or images considered pornographic.
1.5.6.3.1.2.1.1. Pro: The [Sex Machines Museum](http://www.sexmachinesmuseum.com/) in Prague does not admit anyone under the age of 18.
1.5.6.3.1.3. Pro: Even if exhibitions are available to everyone, the public can still choose to enter or not depending on their values and customs.
1.5.6.3.1.4. Pro: Art and galleries can include content warnings and age restrictions which enable people to choose, whereas in public, the same choice is not given if nipple showing is unrestricted.
1.5.6.3.1.4.1. Con: These avenues can have these warnings, many do not.
1.5.6.3.1.4.2. Con: Even some text books include images of nude females.
1.5.7. Con: Censorship on the female nipple exists in art as well. For example, [an Australian art magazine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/09/art-magazine-vault-adds-stickers-to-breasts-of-painted-nude-at-distributors-request) covered the nipples of a nude, pregnant woman painted by the artist Yuskavage.
1.5.7.1. Con: However, that is a publication, not a [museum](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/11333473/British-Museum-explains-why-Greek-statues-are-naked.html) and it is almost exceptional. Artistic nudes are displayed in museums and [media](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/17/themuseum-naked-_n_6662096.html) without any censorship.
1.5.7.2. Con: Some TV stations censor nude artwork and some do not or do it to a lesser extent, highlighting that rules are [arbitrary](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/censorship-of-nude-art_us_564639fde4b045bf3deefeeb) and ineffective.
1.5.8. Pro: Nipple showing is broadly accepted in fashion and haute couture.
1.5.8.1. Pro: Women are going bare breasts in other areas of society as well without having major issues.
1.5.8.2. Pro: Some women designed the [Ta-Ta Top bikini line](https://thetatatop.com/) \(a swim-suit to look topless without breaking the law\) to show that if illustrations of nipples are acceptable, nipple showing should be as well.
1.5.8.3. Pro: The [braless trend](http://www.theblondesalad.com/fashion/trends/free-the-nipple-fall-winter-2017-2018.html#gallery-slideshow-dennis-basso8) seen on couture fashion catwalks this season is inspired by the Free the Nipple movement.
1.5.8.3.1. Pro: Several [models](http://www.vogue.com/article/bella-hadid-dior-spring-2017-couture-masquerade-free-nipple), [actors](https://variety.com/2017/film/news/emma-watson-vanity-fair-topless-feminism-1202002450/) and [fashion influencers](http://www.urbanandstylish.com/fashion/2017/01/chiara-ferragni-braless-at-dior-event-during-paris-fashion-week/) are starting to support #FreetheNipple by wearing braless clothes and posting pictures on social networks.
1.5.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.1.2.4.
1.5.8.5. Con: It is still currently unacceptable to wear these fashions out in public, even if it is considered fashionable by the elite.
1.5.9. Con: Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Superbowl halftime show - referred to as "[Nipplegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime-show_controversy)" - was widely criticized and had a massive effect on censorship and the broadcasting of entertainment.
1.5.9.1. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.1.
1.5.9.2. Con: The furore over nipplegate in the USA was not entirely about nipples, it was about race and rape and probably a few other things.  Justin Timberlake - a white man - tore off Jackson's - a black woman - clothing, exposing her whole breast, over the lyrics "Gonna have you naked by the end of this song". There's a lot more going on that just people seeing a nipple.
1.5.9.3. Pro: YouTube inventor Jawed Karim stated that the incident [inspired](https://www.thoughtco.com/who-invented-youtube-1992691) him to invent the platform because he could not find any video of the incident online.
1.5.9.4. Pro: Under [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/) jurisdiction broadcasting delays were lengthened. The 2017 Superbowl was broadcast with a 5 second [delay](http://www.sportingnews.com/au/nfl/news/super-bowl-51-halftime-show-lady-gaga-janet-jackson-justin-timberlake-tape-delay/imvmym20z9ky13cdlar77iylt).
1.5.9.5. Pro: After the halftime show, Janet Jackson was effectively [blacklisted](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emma-gray/janet-jackson-wardrobe-malfunction-super-bowl-justin-timberlake_b_4698190.html) by Viacom, which owns VH1 and MTV, and bore the brunt of [blame](http://gawker.com/nipplegate-at-10-how-justin-won-superbowl-xxxviii-and-1511051968) for what happened.
1.5.9.6. Con: While the public rejects a wardrobe malfunction in a sports event, fans expect and do not complain about the use of [women](http://www.washingtontimes.com/multimedia/collection/15-hottest-NFL-cheerleaders/) in male dominated sports as '[eye-candy](http://www.motogp.com/en/gallery/2017/04/24/paddock-girls-red-bull-grand-prix-of-the-americas/226360)', showing the hypocritical standards women are subjected to.
1.5.9.6.1. Pro: Although NBA player Lebron James [accidentally flashed his penis](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/12/lebron-jamess-accidental-penis-flash-lends-stroke-of-controversy-to-game-4) during an NBA finals game, he did not receive the same ridicule and penalty as Janet Jackson did during her Super Bowl wardrobe malfunction.
1.5.10. Con: -> See 1.5.6.3.1.4.
1.5.11. Pro: Facebook rules prohibit nudity yet reproductions of “paintings, sculptures and other [art](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/facebook-explains-what-it-bans-and-why/) that depicts nude figures” are accepted.
1.5.12. Con: Social media websites apply strong policies where women's posts are policed and removed if they show their nipples.
1.5.12.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.2.1.2.1.
1.5.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.2.2.1.2.
1.5.12.3. Pro: Female nudity is not treated equally in social media.
1.5.12.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.1.4.5.
1.5.12.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.2.2.1.2.
1.5.12.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.4.1.1.1.
1.5.12.3.4. Pro: Breast cancer survivors often have photos of their post-mastectomy bodies [censored](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/facebook-bans-mastectomy-pix-anger-cancer-survivors-article-1.1363623) by social media sites.
1.5.12.3.4.1. Con: Having photos censored by social media is not physically harmful for breast cancer survivors, so displaying the photos is not a necessity.
1.5.12.3.4.1.1. Con: Many discriminatory circumstances \(e.g. not being allowed to vote due to gender or race reasons\) are not physically harmful, yet eradicating them is necessary.
1.5.12.3.4.1.2. Con: However, it may be psychologically harmful, especially as many cancer survivors use these images to improve their body image and empower themselves and are told their bodies are wrong or unlawful.
1.5.12.3.4.2. Pro: It is pointless to censor a post-mastectomy breast if the nipple and areola has been removed. The fact that they are still censored regardless suggests major inconsistencies with this gender-specific restriction.
1.5.12.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.1.4.1.
1.5.13. Con: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.3.
1.5.14. Con: Although most  visual art is [protected](http://ncac.org/issue/visual-art) under the First Amendment, objections often arise when considering works involving religious, political, or nude content.
1.6. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.
1.7. Pro: Gender restrictions on nipples have unintended negative consequences.
1.7.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.7.2. Pro: The requirement of hiding nipples often includes a social requirement to wear a bra as to prevent nipples from poking through clothing. Bras are detrimental to the health of some women.
1.7.3. Pro: Restricting nipple showing \(legally and by moral taboo\) is a reinforcement of cultural sexualization of the female form \(even pre-puberty\), something that is widely acknowledged to be detrimental  to the mental health of girls and women. [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/overcoming-child-abuse/201203/the-sexualization-women-and-girls) \(could use a better reference article\)
1.7.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.
1.7.5. Pro: Restricting nipple showing is harmful for breast cancer survivors.
1.7.5.1. Con: Breast cancer survivors may feel excluded from campaigns like 'Free the Nipple'.
1.7.5.2. Pro: Many breast cancer survivors feel as though their post-mastectomy bodies are [stigmatized](https://qz.com/432083/why-i-chose-a-life-without-breasts-after-cancer/). Normalizing breast-showing in public would likely reduce that stigma, by showcasing a more diverse range of bodies than what is encompassed by traditional beauty norms.
1.7.5.2.1. Pro: Many women who survived breast cancer get realistic [tattoos](http://community.breastcancer.org/blog/vinnie-myers-3-d-nipple-tattoo-artist-frequently-asked-questions/) of nipples to complete reconstructive procedures.
1.7.5.2.1.1. Pro: One breast cancer survivor [opted for a tattoo](http://www.thefrisky.com/2016-09-02/a-breast-cancer-survivor-bypasses-female-nipple-censorship-in-the-most-epic-way/) instead of a nipple reconstruction in order to empower other survivors and raise awareness of the double standards women's nipples face on social media.
1.7.5.2.2. Con: Conversely, breast cancer survivors may feel self-conscious and uncomfortable exposing their breasts in public post-mastectomy [\(Tarrier, p.16\)](https://books.google.com/books?id=StNRAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=mastectomy+social+anxiety&source=bl&ots=_e4iXLO9RV&sig=K6KcFomC1gXVSnFNeYiSaSO-zII&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjiw-mJ6qnUAhUJSyYKHXwICBEQ6AEIMjAB#v=onepage&q=mastectomy%20social%20anxiety&f=false).
1.7.5.2.2.1. Con: Since the publication of the reference thirty years ago, social attitudes towards breasts have changed enough so more women feel confident [exposing](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/well/live/going-flat-after-breast-cancer.html) their post-mastectomy chests.
1.7.5.3. Con: Many women are already pressured into breast reconstruction after a [mastectomy](http://breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/no-reconstruction). Emphasizing the significance of breasts and nipples makes this more likely.
1.7.5.3.1. Con: The significance of breasts as integral and sexualised components of women’s femininity and appeal is the reason behind restricting nipple exposure and why women feel pressured to have breast reconstruction.
1.7.5.3.2. Con: On the contrary, a more progressive stance and the desexualisation of breasts can be more helpful. An increasingly high percentage of women \([44%](http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/no-reconstruction) in 2014\) choose to ‘[go flat](http://breastfree.org/)’ and have no breast reconstruction.
1.7.5.3.2.1. Con: Breast cancer patients can't be compared with non breast cancer women in a discussion on sexualization of breasts as surviving such a disease is more important than sex, and can be a source of social recognition and appeal on itself that justifies its exposition.
1.7.5.3.2.2. Con: If anything, a benefitial 'flat' alternative supports desexualization of breasts but not the benefits of exposing healthy breasts in public as it could be a form of sexualization of them in a culture were most women already cover them with clothes.
1.7.5.3.2.3. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.19.4.8.1.2.
1.7.5.3.2.4. Pro: These women feel breasts do not [define](http://breastfree.org/) them and prioritise a [quicker](http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/reconstruction/is-reconstruction-for-you) recovery and not having to endure numerous surgeries or health complications.
1.7.5.3.2.5. Pro: Although some doctors promote reconstruction, as some studies suggest it improves women’s quality of life, a systematic review of [28 cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/well/live/going-flat-after-breast-cancer.html) found that women who ‘go flat’ had no worse outcomes and, in some cases, even fared better in quality of life, body image and sex.
1.7.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.5.12.3.4.
1.7.6. Pro: In addition to women being affected, these restrictions also limit the body freedoms of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.
1.7.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.3.
1.7.6.2. Pro: For example, trans men can be misgendered under such regulations, because people often conflate physical characteristics and gender identity.
1.7.6.3. Pro: Necessarily, any law which defines gender in a binary way erases trans and non-binary identities.
1.7.7. Con: If the benefits of the restriction outweigh the unintended consequences, it is a necessary trade-off.
1.7.7.1. Con: There is no benefit to forcing women to cover their chest.
1.7.7.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.7.7.3. Con: Yet the assertion that the benefits of the restriction outweigh the unintended consequences is rather subjective.
1.7.7.4. Con: If the benefits consist of appeasing the moral values of some, while women and non-binary individuals are discriminated against or not able to breastfeed freely, it is difficult to ascertain why a group of people's values and rights outweigh another's.
1.7.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.
1.7.7.6. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.3.1.18.
1.8. Pro: Women are allowed to go bare-chested in public in other countries. The US should be no different.
1.8.1. Con: The US may have cultural ingredients that make this policy less safe than it is elsewhere.  For instance, the presence of many different cultures and beliefs together in close proximity, and the inclination to commercialize beauty and youth.
1.8.1.1. Con: Canada, Germany and France are culturally diverse countries that are commercially similar to the USA and they have Top-free legislation in place [as do many states](http://gotopless.org/topless-laws) in the USA.
1.8.1.2. Con: Cultural diversity means people, and laws alike are more aware of, and better able to accommodate each other, as well as new ideas, if anything, America is a safer place to try new ideas like this.
1.8.2. Con: Removing nipple restrictions is incompatible with the culture of the United States. Instead, both men and women should not be allowed to show their nipples in public. This aligns with American culture and still constitutes equal protection under the law.
1.8.3. Con: Even in those countries, there [are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_laws_by_country#Table) still limitations to toplessness that have been put in place; the most liberal country in that sense seems to be Spain, yet for instance, on April 2011, the Barcelona City Council [voted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indecent_exposure#Europe) a by-law forbidding men and women from walking "naked or nearly naked in public spaces" and limiting the wearing of bathing costumes to pools, beaches, adjacent streets and sea-side walks. It seems some limitations to top-freedom is necessary.
1.8.3.1. Con: Those limitations apply to both genders, and thus constitute no inequality problem.
1.8.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.3.2.2.1.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.20.3.1.
1.8.6. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.11.1.
1.8.7. Pro: It is indicative that the United States is [one of only six countries](http://freethenipple.com/the-era-campaing/) in the world \(along with Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Palau and Tonga\) that have not ratified the UN convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination of women \(CEDAW\).
1.8.7.1. Con: The US has stated that it won't sign a number of UN policies as its Bill of Rights already has them covered. This maybe the case here.
1.8.7.2. Con: There are over 60 countries registering reservations and 24 countries expressing objections to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, many of which have conditionally ratified the treaty with the stipulation that those countries are not bound where the treaty conflicts with existing legal codes within those countries that expressly discriminate against women.  [treaties.un.org](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-8&chapter=4&lang=en)
1.8.7.3. Pro: The US, as a liberal democracy, has more in common with countries such as Canada or Germany than those countries, therefore it would make sense for the US to adopt policies supporting women’s rights.
1.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.3.1.
1.10. Con: Nipple showing may create a culture where some women feel pressured by photographers or revelers to expose their bodies.
1.10.1. Con: Some women being pressured to show their bodies is better than all woman being forced to cover their bodies.
1.10.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.11.3.3.3.
1.10.1.2. Con: Creating pressure on someone is the equivalent to restricting their freedom to choose. If the greater aim of gender equality is freedom to choose for men or women then no one should be pressured against their own will.
1.10.1.2.1. Con: If the aim of gender equality is freedom to choose for men and women, then not allowing women to choose at all \(and forcing them to cover up\) is even worse than some degree of societal pressure.
1.10.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.10.3. Pro: For some people, breasts are fully developed before the age of consent.  A free-nipple policy would put incredible pressure on young women to expose their nipples.  This pressure might come before they have learned all the pros and cons of their decision.
1.10.3.1. Con: This is no different from the current pressures adolescent girls face with other elements of fashion relating to body parts that don't have legal restrictions on them, such as pressure to reveal their legs or cleavage, pressure to wear makeup or style their hair a certain way, etc. There is no reason to treat nipples differently.
1.10.3.1.1. Con: Just because current fashion trends pressure young girls into these things, that does not mean we should pressure them to reveal themselves even more.
1.10.3.1.1.1. Con: Relieving part of the societal pressure and allowing women to be bare-chested in some leisure spaces where men are, should probably be a better solution than the hypocritical prohibition of nipple exposure while promoting the rest.
1.10.4. Con: Cleavage showing is already allowed but it didn't create a culture where any women feel pressured to show cleavage. So it's unlikely that being allowed to show nipples wiill create such a culture.
1.10.5. Pro: Men are socially expected to be shirtless when swimming. While some men enjoy this freedom, other men are uncomfortable with it. Although they are not \(usually\) prohibited from wearing a shirt, they are socially pressured into going topless against their wish.
1.10.5.1. Con: Plenty of people choose to wear shirts while swimming regardless of gender.
1.10.5.2. Con: Surely this is an argument for freeing the nipple, as the main topic is about choice. Men should have the choice to cover up equally as women should have the choice not to. Society shouldn't be pressuring anyone to do either.
1.10.5.3. Con: Rash vests and other sun protection tops are common for both men and women.
1.10.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.
1.10.5.5. Con: Laws are a higher order of enforcement than social pressure, and carry higher penalties that cannot be opted out of.  Passing laws on a group to protect a subset from possible pressure is overkill.
1.10.6. Con: Having the right to go topless in public doesn't imply that women will be tempted to do so in greater numbers or at greater frequency.
1.10.6.1. Pro: 'Nipple showing' as we currently know it hasn't created a culture whereby men feel pressured to expose their bodies. While everyone can feel insecure about exposing skin, 'freeing the nipple' does not seem to create a wave of nudists or a dramatic shift in what is considered normal. It's merely going to result in equality for males and females.
1.10.6.2. Pro: Women can still choose modesty under this policy.
1.10.6.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.2.1.
1.10.7. Con: Considering, that men don't feel pressured to show their naked chest simply leads to the conclusion, that this inequality is a social construct. Making this a reason to surpress women's rights continously is just invalid.
1.10.7.1. Con: While it is true that men don't feel much pressure to expose themselves, this doesn't necessarily suggest that women won't feel such pressure. The gender roles that our culture puts people in predispose women and men to different thoughts, feelings, and patterns of behavior based on how they are socialized. Allowing women to be topless must accompany a shift away from patriarchy in general, which would change many more aspects of our culture.
1.10.7.1.1. Con: The Free the Nipples Movement is part of an attempt to shift away from patriarchy in general, and induce a change in many more aspects of our culture.
1.10.7.1.2. Con: It is difficult to make instinct and sexual drive change through socialization, and even harder to convince individuals that their natural - often unconscious - actions need changing in the first place.
1.10.8. Pro: Members of the public would be exposed to view bare breasts against their will.  Nipple exposure for men and women should be limited to designated "nipple friendly" establishments.
1.10.8.1. Con: Women's rights should trump these people's rights to have things censored for them.
1.10.8.1.1. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.10.8.1.2. Pro: Individuals maintain the right to select for content they prefer to experience. They may socialize with people who expose their nipples or people who do not expose their nipples. Society does not need to be censored because it is the individual's right and responsibility to decide what is appropriate for them.
1.10.8.2. Con: People who object to nipple exposure could move to gated off 'nipple free zones' instead of demanding others accommodate them.
1.10.8.2.1. Pro: Most workplaces enforce a dress code that is not prescribed by legislation. Those dress codes prohibit torso nudity for both genders. It is unlikely that those dress codes would go away because of a change in the law.
1.10.8.3. Con: The availability of exposure to a phenomenon is not a violation of individual liberties. Being forced to experience a phenomenon is a violation of individual liberties. This would only be a problem if all US citizens were required to look at female nipples.
1.10.8.3.1. Con: Individual liberties apply to even just one individual even if not all US citizens are affected. Someone obliged by contract to remain in an area and who is shown something disturbing against their will by their contractors, could be considered a violation of individual liberties by your definition.
1.10.8.4. Con: People do not have a right to never have to see anything that offends them. That something may be offensive to some people is not in itself a reason to make it illegal.
1.10.9. Con: -> See 1.10.6.2.
1.10.10. Con: Potential changes in social pressures and what is considered "normal" are irrelevant to the question of legality.
1.10.10.1. Pro: A behavior should be illegal only if it infringes upon the rights of another person. No one has a right to constant and unchanging social norms. Fashion trends change all the time. Music trends change all the time. Speech and etiquette norms change all the time. The law does not and should not protect the status quo of social norms for their own sake.
1.10.10.1.1. Con: Suicide does not really infringe on other people's rights, but their is a good reason to make it illegal, as it allows police intervention when people are not of sound mind.
1.10.10.1.1.1. Con: The legality of suicide \([which varies widely by jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation)\) notwithstanding, police can and do intervene on behalf of public safety in situations where no crime is being committed. An attempted suicide is a situation in which a person's safety/well-being is at risk, so police are justified in intervening. There is no comparison to be made with nipple exposure, which in itself presents no threat to public safety \(and is certainly not evidence that someone is "not of sound mind"\).
1.10.11. Con: Women's bodies should not be legislated against when the problem does not lie with them. Photographers should be expected to obtain informed consent.
1.10.12. Con: There have always been societal pressures on women to conform to a certain way of being. Women themselves can decipher what pressures they can and cannot handle.
1.10.12.1. Pro: We currently live in a society where women are pressured to cover up. Regardless, someone is going to feel pressured. We ought to let individuals decide what these standards are, and not dictate it to them with this top-down approach.
1.10.12.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.4.7.4.
1.10.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.6.5.8.2.3.
1.10.13. Con: It is already legal for women to pose topless or naked for photographers and many events \(e.g. Mardi Gras\) do not enforce the nipple rules.  These scenarios already exist.
1.10.14. Pro: People tend to [conform to society](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/4240758/Mental-process-which-explains-why-we-follow-crowds-revealed.html) based on what is considered normative, irrespective of their previous beliefs and decisions. Because of this, women may feel a need to expose their nipples, even if it is against their own judgment.
1.10.14.1. Con: "Tending to conform" isn't the same as "feeling forced to" though. Fashion trends for example aren't followed because people feel forced to follow them.
1.10.14.2. Con: People tend to conform but in other [countries](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2692949/Getting-naked-Germans-like-nude-holiday-holidaymakers-country-say-Expedia.html), such as France or Greece, women go with and without their top on. This is about giving freedom, not imposing it.
1.10.14.3. Con: People also have an [individuality](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/individuality), that allows them to choose how they conform to society or to which norms they conform to.
1.10.14.4. Pro: For example, people tend to dress according to the current fashion trends, simply because the majority of society and media says it is currently fashionable.
1.10.15. Pro: A topless trend would not be accessible for all women, leading to self-esteem issues.
1.10.15.1. Con: Men do not have undue self-esteem issues for being allowed to walk topless. Women would have no worse self-esteem issues than men have, beyond "personalized to the ideal feminine" instead of "personalized to the ideal masculine".
1.10.15.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.2.1.
1.10.15.3. Pro: For example, [the 'braless' trend was labelled exclusionary of large-breasted and/or large women](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/style/2016/08/30/do-braless-bralette-no-makeup-trends-exclude-normal-women/89428322/), for comfort and self-esteem reasons.
1.10.15.4. Con: Toplessness is significantly more accessible than other fashion trends, which can often be very expensive.
1.10.15.5. Con: Allowing breast showing does not translate into creating a "topless trend".
1.10.15.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.14.3.1.3.
1.10.15.5.2. Pro: Removing restrictions on nipple showing for women is not about adhering to a fashion trend. It is about gender equality.
1.10.15.5.2.1. Con: Regardless of the intent behind removing nipple restrictions, what women choose to wear or not to wear will inevitably become a matter of fashion.
1.10.15.5.2.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.8.3.
1.10.15.5.3. Con: Even if the principle is one of gender equality, once this right is won there will be an expectation that women access it, by going topless in public.
1.10.15.5.3.1. Con: Women in most countries/ professions won the right to wear [trousers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_trousers). While wearing trousers is now accepted, it is not expected of women.
1.10.15.5.3.2. Con: -> See 1.1.6.1.3.2.20.1.1.
1.10.15.6. Pro: [This study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/homo-consumericus/201312/women-s-breasts-female-insecurity-male-satisfaction) found that only 30% of women were satisfied with their own breasts.
1.10.15.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.5.3.5.1.
1.10.15.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.9.
1.10.15.8. Con: -> See 1.2.10.5.4.1.
