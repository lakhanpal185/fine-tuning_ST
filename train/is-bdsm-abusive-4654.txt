Discussion Title: Is BDSM Abusive?

1. The practice of BDSM is abusive.
1.1. Pro: Some BDSM relationships simulate abusive environments.
1.1.1. Con: [Simulation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulation) is not equivalent to the actual activity. Simulating abuse means that it is fake and therefore has a control on it, preventing it from harming either party in a serious way.
1.1.1.1. Con: Even simulated abuse can feel real, and cause real emotional damage.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: In a role-playing scenario, a person could become entrenched in their role to the extent that the situation feels real. For example, in a punishment scenario, a person could internalise the idea that they deserve to be punished or hurt.
1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: This would make many forms of art such as acting on stage, on screen or even writing abusive, when there is clear public agreement that this is not the case.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con: [Method acting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting), which is a technique wherein an actor will immerse themself fully in a role both on- and off-set to achieve complete emotional identification with their character, is controversial largely because of the physical and psychological toll than it can take on actors who get too entrenched in the part.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many people speculate that the psychological extremes to which Heath Ledger went in order to fully immerse himself in his iconic role as the Joker may have been a [factor](https://moviepilot.com/posts/3548627) in his fatal drug overdose.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Heath Ledger locked himself up in a hotel room for months and spent long hours in full costume and make up to get himself into the Joker's frame of mind.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Some [reports](https://moviepilot.com/posts/3548627) assert that Heath developed health problems such as insomnia, paranoia, and panic attacks as a result of delving to deep into his character.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.3. Con: Heath Ledger's death is controversial and there's no acceptance to whether playing the Joker actually contributed to his death. The source described in the above argument also attests to this.
1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro: Method actors have often [jeopardized their health](https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jul/29/extreme-weight-loss-when-method-acting-goes-too-far) in pursuit of character immersion by losing/gaining significant amounts of weight over a short period of time, pulling their own teeth, cutting/mutilating themselves, living in unsanitary conditions/not practicing proper hygiene, and other such practices.
1.1.1.1.2. Pro: 'Simulated' insults are still spoken; 'simulated' control still limits a person's freedom. These practices could make someone feel demeaned and abused, even if they thought they could handle it.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: If actors engage in a scene of abuse for a movie, it does not mean that one is actually subjecting the other to abuse and torture. Instead, it is a simulation of abuse in a controlled environment where either party can opt out of the scene or stop it when necessary.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: Actors are playing an entirely and inherently false and constructed role. This is generally untrue for BDSM participants.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con: An actor's involvement in the scene changes depending on the acting techniques being used. In most techniques however, even when the character is fictional, on some level the actor must be [really](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/11/actors-emotions-on-stage-kate-fleetwood-michelle-terry-ben-miles) in the situation on stage.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The Stanislavski Method trains actors to make everything on stage as "[real](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/theatre/stanislavskis-method-of-acting.php)" as possible. Actors must use personal emotions and experiences on stage, while immersed in their characters, and work within the scene as true to themselves within certain "given circumstances".
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con: Many theatre companies use real people representing their own lives on stage.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.1. Pro: Brokentalker's production of "[Have I No Mouth](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/theater/have-i-no-mouth-plumbs-the-depths-of-an-irish-family.html)" is an autobiographical piece that tells the story of the main actor's family’s experience of loss: the death of his father and of his newborn brother years before. The other two actors in this piece are his real life mother and therapist.
1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2.2. Pro: "[Can I Start Again Please](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/06/edinburgh-festival-2015-review-can-i-start-again-please-summerhall)" is performed and created by Sue MacLaine who tells the true story of the challenges she faced as a deaf child suffering from child abuse.
1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Pro: From the [butter scene](https://theestablishment.co/directors-shouldnt-abuse-actors-for-the-sake-of-brilliant-art-8f2fc975c7a5) in 'The Last Tango' we can see the difference between controlled abuse and abuse. The fact that the scene deviated away from the planed actions was what caused the actress, Maria Schneider, to feel as if she was "a little raped".
1.1.1.1.3. Pro: Some participants can experience "Recalling," or "[Flashbacks](http://www.lanternproject.org.uk/library/mental-health-issues-and-information/flashbacks/flashbacks-and-scenes/)" due to the nature of the role-playing. An example of this could be someone who was raped a long time before,  having a flashback to that traumatic moment during a humiliation scene.
1.1.1.1.3.1. Con: This is a risk that is taken by countless amounts of people every day in many different situations, not just in BDSM. Flashbacks can be [triggered by almost anything](https://www.rainn.org/articles/flashbacks), not just intense situations such as BDSM.
1.1.1.1.3.2. Con: This is a reason to make trauma care and physiological assistance more easily available for victims of traumatic events, not label BDSM activities as inherently abusive.
1.1.1.1.3.3. Con: This claim doesn't fit in the context of evaluating whether the practice of BDSM is inherently abusive or not. It's a case for not engaging into activities that can trigger retraumatization.
1.1.1.1.4. Pro: There are "[Extreme Haunted Houses](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/weird-news/lists/mckamey-manor-this-extreme-haunted-house-is-the-stuff-of-nightmares-9816650.html)" where customers pay to be locked up, tortured and/or scared. They know that it is a paid service that happens in a controlled setting, however, the mental and emotional trauma felt by them is still real.
1.1.1.1.5. Pro: If 'punishments' or other simulated behaviours cause real pain, it would be easy for the submissive in the scenario to feel like their partner meant to hurt them.
1.1.1.1.5.1. Con: Many BDSM submissives share [positive relationships](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201502/the-surprising-psychology-bdsm) with their partners, hence this points to these practices not being abusive.
1.1.1.1.5.1.1. Con: It is a [common psychological response](https://counsellingresource.com/therapy/self-help/stockholm/) for people who have been abused to have a strong emotional connection with their abuser and even feel irrational affection or love for them. That doesn't negate the fact that the abuse they suffer is real.
1.1.1.1.6. Pro: Harassment and abuse in [virtual reality](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/26/virtual-reality-sexual-harassment-online-groping-quivr) can feel real and cause real damage. It follows that the same would be true for simulated role-play scenarios.
1.1.1.1.7. Con: A simulation, inherently, aims at mimicking reality and trying to feel real while, at the same time, preventing harm. If harm actually happens during a simulation, the simulation failed to deliver as planned. So, yes, one can claim that a simulation can feel real and cause damages, but that doesn't make it a valid claim against BDSM as a simulation of abusive environments. It's a claim supporting the unintended risk of damages that simulations can face.
1.1.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.
1.1.1.3. Pro: Actors in movies who partake in sex scenes are often seen as [unprofessional](http://www.etonline.com/news/169457_henry_cavill_admits_he_got_an_erection_filming_a_sex_scene) if they actually get an erection. Simulated environments are often expected to be very far off from reality.
1.1.2. Pro: Controlled abuse is still abuse, controlled is just an adjective.
1.1.2.1. Con: There are instances where we can legally consent to being harmed.
1.1.2.1.1. Pro: Giving consent turns a potential assault into a legally permissible activity.
1.1.2.1.2. Pro: Medical procedures usually require a patient's [informed consent](http://www.templehealth.org/ICTOOLKIT/html/ictoolkitpage5.html).
1.1.2.1.3. Pro: Tattoos and piercings are instances when we hire people to cause harm to our bodies for cosmetic purposes.
1.1.2.1.4. Con: Euthanasia is still [illegal in most of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_euthanasia) even if it is done with the consent of both people involved in it. Consent does not validate the action of euthanasia for a majority of legal systems.
1.1.2.1.5. Pro: In sports like boxing or wrestling, consent to bodily harm is assumed and accepted as a possible side effect of participation.
1.1.2.1.6. Pro: People consent to jobs in the military, in mines and in factories where they run the risk of physical, mental as well as emotional harm.
1.1.2.1.7. Pro: Consent to being harmed is widespread, from religious and politic martyrs, non violent protesters, military personal in action and during training, etc.
1.1.2.2. Pro: The treatment of [actresses](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/obsession-the-dark-side-of-alfred-hitchcock-8431033.html) on set by directors like Alfred Hitchcock is seen very controversially because even while simulating fear and terror in a controlled environment, their actions are still seen as abusive by many.
1.1.2.2.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.2.
1.1.2.2.2. Pro: In [Inglorious Bastards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ7GbBkmIm0) Quentin Tarantino physically strangled Dianne Kruger so that her reaction to being cut off from oxygen would be realistic.
1.1.2.3. Con: What makes abusive behaviours different from abuse in a real life relationship is the amount of power that each consenting party holds. There can be very little of a power imbalance, but otherwise activities that are talked through and consented to are not acts of abuse.
1.1.2.4. Con: -> See 1.1.1.1.2.1.2.
1.1.3. Con: A [study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2016.1168353#.V0VUWpErLIU) revealed that those involved in BDSM are more consent-minded than people who don't practice BDSM when it comes to sex acts and less likely to conform to behaviors associated with rape culture.
1.1.3.1. Con: Consent violations happen just as in other sexual subcultures. Despite its image, though, the BDSM community has often handled them [poorly](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/kink-bdsm-consent-problem/).
1.1.3.1.1. Pro: [Many](http://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/sex/consent-and-abuse-of-power-in-kink-and-other-sexual-communities/) bloggers and activists within the BDSM scene have written and spoken about consent violations and rape culture within the scene.
1.1.3.1.2. Pro: The phrase "[missing stair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair)" was coined to describe people of the community ignoring an abuser in their midst, working around him rather than fixing the situation.
1.1.3.1.3. Con: In general, more credibility should be given to studies than to DailyDot articles.
1.2. Pro: Many BDSM practices are illegal.
1.2.1. Con: The illegality of some BDSM practices does not inherently mean that they're abusive.
1.2.1.1. Pro: Legal systems are built on dominant beliefs, customs and cultures. If the BDSM practices that are illegal now were a part of the dominant culture or customs, then they would probably be legalized.
1.2.1.1.1. Pro: Slavery in the U.S was once legal.  In fact, slavery in the majority of the world was once legal.
1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Homosexuality was illegal in the US because that was seen as unnatural abuse of the human body. However, opinions change over time and now homosexality has gained [acceptance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States) under American law.
1.2.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.1.2.
1.2.2. Pro: In Australia's Northern Territory violent first offences like cutting, scarring, whipping, have [mandatory](https://theconversation.com/fifty-shades-of-grey-and-the-legal-limits-of-bdsm-37475) prison sentences regardless of whether these activities have been consented to.
1.2.2.1. Con: Such laws are often set up with victims of attack or abuse who are unable, or too afraid to speak against their attacker/abuser in mind. Such a power imbalance, one that makes consent insignificant, could be the reasoning behind such laws.
1.2.3. Con: Sodomy is also [illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy_law) in numerous places throughout the world, yet oral and anal sex are common practices within many vanilla hetero- and homosexual relationships.
1.2.4. Con: Legality is a question of law that shifts from time to time. It does nothing to qualify or disqualify the abusive nature of BDSM. Many abusive activities are legal, and similarly many non abusive activities are illegal.
1.2.4.1. Pro: BDSM scenes are often comprised of various actions, and thus whether or not they can be interpreted as abusive depends on a number of factors such as which actions occur, the context and the combinations of actions.
1.2.4.2. Pro: Laws change depending on the social outlook of the community that is governed by those laws. Just because something is considered unacceptable now, does not mean it could not become acceptable some time in the future.
1.2.4.2.1. Pro: Marriage equality was not afforded to people of the LGBTQ community in the United States until 2015.
1.2.4.2.2. Con: This is a slippery slope to go down, as any action currently illegal can be said to fall under the same criteria. The mere possibility of future legalization does not make current actions acceptable.
1.2.5. Con: BDSM is made up of a wide range of activities, most of which are not illegal, and some are in a grey area. Dismissing BDSM as being abusive just because some actions that could possibly be a part of it may be illegal is unfair.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Erotic humiliation, a very common activity in BDSM, while consisting of many bullying tactics contains many activities which are not traditionally abusive such as; asking permission to eat, to go to the bathroom, being treated or scolded like a child or made to use honorifics such as Master, Mistress, Sir, Ma’am or Daddy.
1.2.5.2. Pro: Controlling the sub's clothes choices is another activity often engaged in BDSM scenes. There can be sexual denial through use of a chastity device; enforced dress code \(or forced cross dressing\) or forced nudity.
1.2.5.3. Pro: Due to the fact that different people in the community have different preferences there are some people who practise BDSM who engage in nothing illegal or violent.
1.2.6. Con: -> See 1.2.4.2.
1.3. Pro: BDSM can result in participants being hurt more than they are prepared for.
1.3.1. Pro: There have been [extreme cases](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=4285958&page=1) where participants have succumbed to death while participating in BDSM.
1.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.3.
1.3.3. Con: There are dangers in many activities that consenting adults are prepared to risk. These dangers do not make the activities inherently abusive.
1.3.3.1. Con: The difference between BDSM and any other consent-based activity is that in some BDSM activities a person is actively being harmed, leaving there to be much greater room for a fatal accident than another activity.
1.3.3.1.1. Pro: Due to the huge reliance on the individuals' knowledge and previous experience, [novices](http://www.katekinsey.com/advice-to-the-newbie-submissive.html) can easily end up harming people seriously.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Novice mistakes don't prove intentional abuse or inherent abuse.
1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Con: Since everyone is a novice at some point and something as simple as making a mistake can be turned into abuse in the BDSM community that means that the abuse is inherent as it is so easy for a novice to make a mistake.
1.3.3.1.1.1.2. Pro: Just like in any relationship, learning about each other and discovering boundaries is an unavoidable danger zone, full of opportunities to inadvertently hurt the other. BDSM mistakes are not abusive in nature\(or often even in appearance\), but simple mistakes that each individual will experience and learn from.
1.3.3.1.1.2. Pro: BDSM erotica and porn influences newcomers to the BDSM world as it is the the most available link to BDSM many people have. As these stories and films are fictitious however they may put across an untrue or dangerous version of BDSM.
1.3.3.1.1.3. Con: This could be true for a host of activities that are beneficial for individuals but are somewhat dangerous or tricky.
1.3.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: An unskilled chef could cause serious gastric problems for those consuming their food if the food \(especially meat and seafood\) are not treated or cleaned well enough.
1.3.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: An inexperienced crane or freight operator on docks or a construction site could seriously injure their co-workers.
1.3.3.1.1.3.2.1. Con: Crane and freight operators are required to undergo training and have licenses. This is not true for BDSM practitioners.
1.3.3.1.1.3.3. Pro: Novice drivers could put their passengers and pedestrians at risk if they drive in pressure or unfamiliar conditions.
1.3.3.1.1.4. Con: According to the article, it is just as easy to find a seasoned person in the BDSM community who hasn't bothered to educate themselves on safety processes.
1.3.3.1.1.5. Pro: The "trendy" pop culture understanding of BDSM is very [far from](https://www.dailydot.com/via/everything-youve-heard-bdsm-wrong/) what BDSM really is.
1.3.3.1.1.5.1. Pro: BDSM is practiced by a limited community and not that well understood or talked about by most people. As a result, since most people don't understand it and have never been a part of it, they tend to fear the practice and label it as being abusive.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2. Con: Although exaggerated, the pop culture understanding of BDSM and the reality do share similarities. Just because the former is [warped](https://ladygeekgirl.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/sexualized-saturdays-bdsm-in-fanfiction-and-pop-culture/), that doesn't mean they don't have [aspects of truth](https://www.bustle.com/articles/64343-what-fifty-shades-of-grey-got-right-very-wrong-about-the-bdsm-experience-according-to) in them.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.1. Con: Any warping of the truth of this community can be detrimental as it will lead to novices believing that it is the true way things work which will inherently lead to accidents and harm.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.2. Pro: While at first glance 'Secretary' may seems like a reinforcement of typical male dominance/female submission tropes, the [depth and complexity](https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/thinking-kink-secretary-feminist-magazine-film-sex-bdsm-kink-movies) of the characters make this film a fairly realistic representation of a BDSM relationship.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Rather than appearing helpless or like a victim, Maggie Gyllenhaal's submissive character displays typical and realistic [brat](http://www.devianceanddesire.com/2015/09/brats-sams-and-break-mes/) behavior by often provoking her Dominant into punishing her.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.2.2. Pro: Lee, Gyllenhaal's character, repeatedly demonstrates that she is only submissive when she wants to be by refusing to submit to other potential partners and even by slapping her Dom \(played by James Spader\) when he fires her in an attempt to end their relationship.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.2.3. Con: This film paints Lee as a submissive character based off of her history as a self-harmer and a mental patient with family issues, reinforcing the common myth that submissives are always people with deep-seeded psychological issues.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.2.4. Con: While a proper BDSM relationship involves a negotiation of limits and consent prior to any activity, 'Secretary' lacks any such discussion. Consequently, the initiation of the characters' relationship could be considered abuse.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.3. Con: There is a [myth](https://ladygeekgirl.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/sexualized-saturdays-bdsm-in-fanfiction-and-pop-culture/) seen in pop culture that people who enjoy BDSM relationships and sex must have some kind of psychological trauma.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4. Con: Most people who actually practice BDSM [do not believe](https://www.quora.com/What-do-members-of-the-BDSM-community-think-about-50-Shades-of-Gray) that such works as "Fifty Shades of Grey" are accurate depictions of BDSM.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4.1. Pro: Many in the BDSM community have [spoken out](https://relevantmagazine.com/culture/film/fifty-shades-grey-and-abuse) about the fact that the books show a lack of safety and consent such that the relationship constitutes abuse rather than being about a healthy and fun BDSM relationship.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4.2. Con: The huge mainstream readership of "Fifty Shades of Gray" means that a large portion of the novice audience is likely to see it as an authority on what constitutes a good and healthy BDSM relationship.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4.2.1. Pro: Due to the fact that these fictional books may be the first introduction people have into the world of BDSM, it may influence their behavior in future sexual encounters if they choose to enter the BDSM community.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4.2.1.1. Pro: A [study](https://www.bustle.com/articles/37219-50-shades-of-grey-linked-to-abuse-and-eating-disorders-new-study-says-surprise-except-not) found that young women who have read Fifty Shades of Grey are more likely to have abusive partners than women who haven’t read the book.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: [Researchers](https://www.bustle.com/articles/37219-50-shades-of-grey-linked-to-abuse-and-eating-disorders-new-study-says-surprise-except-not) found that women who had read Fifty Shades of Grey were 25% more likely to have a partner who yelled or swore at them and 35% more likely to have a partner who exhibited stalker-like behaviors.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4.2.1.1.2. Pro: The [author](https://www.bustle.com/articles/37219-50-shades-of-grey-linked-to-abuse-and-eating-disorders-new-study-says-surprise-except-not) of the previously mentioned study stated “If women experienced adverse health behaviors such as disordered eating first, reading ‘Fifty Shades’ might reaffirm those experiences and potentially aggravate related trauma. Likewise, if they read ‘Fifty Shades before experiencing the health behaviors seen in our study, it’s possible the book influences the onset of these behaviors.”
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4.2.1.1.3. Con: It is unlikely that a piece of fiction was the initial catalyst in leading them to seek out abusive behavior.
1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: The women who read Fifty Shades of Grey and then sought out partners who would emulate the book's relationship were likely already primed to be abuse victims long before reading the book \(the book simply reaffirmed their desire to have a controlling partner\).
1.3.3.1.1.5.3. Pro: The media we consume affects our understanding of what is normal and what is desirable. Poorly written pop-culture "expertise" on what constitutes BDSM relationships sends the message that abusive behavior is actually romantic and desirable.
1.3.3.1.1.5.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4.2.1.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4. Pro: Many \(fictional\) texts about BDSM describe abusive relationships. This, however, is not true of the majority of real-world BDSM relationships.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.1. Con: Books create tension by creating scenarios to drive the story. So it's really that a book about an abusive relationship has BDSM in it. It's a correlation, but does not describe something 'inherent' within BDSM itself.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.2. Pro: Classical literature about BDSM, or sadomasochism, usually describes dysfunctional and often abusive relationships.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.2.1. Pro: One reason BDSM is often associated with abuse is the influence of the [Marquis de Sade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Sade)'s works. The 18th century philosopher is best known for combining pornography and philosophy. His works focused on criminality, blasphemy, and violence, which has been connected to the abuse of corporal punishment he suffered at the hands of his Jesuit teachers.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.2.1.1. Pro: Works like de Sade's [120 Days of Sodom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_120_Days_of_Sodom) are not works of erotic fiction but rather depictions of violent orgies that suggest BDSM has roots in violent and abusive fantasies.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: For example, towards the end of "[120 Days of Sodom](https://www.odaha.com/sites/default/files/120_days_of_sodom.pdf)" he writes: "He \[the protagonist\] likes to trample on a pregnant woman until she aborts. Prior to this, he whips her." Later he illustrates a pregnant woman nailed to a table, with nails driven through her eyes and mouth, before having her nipples and genitals burned and a giant spike driven through her stomach: "It undoes mother and child." \(p. 341, p. 347\)
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.2.2. Pro: The term masochism was coined after the 19th century author [Leopold von Sacher-Masoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_von_Sacher-Masoch). His most famous novella "Venus in Furs" is chiefly about deriving pleasure from being abused.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.2.2.1. Pro: In the [novella](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gv9va/cliterature-venus-in-Furs), the protagonist, Severin, likes when his wife beats him, pokes him with golden hair needles, and drives him through a field like an ox.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.2.3. Pro: Many literary tropes, especially the ones common in romance literature which describe abusive tropes, exist in both mainstream and kinky fiction.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.2.3.1. Pro: In [Wuthering Heights](http://ashvamegh.net/dark-side-love-wuthering-heights/) Heathcliff is abusive to his wife Isabella and the love between himself and Catherine, which is central to the book, is destructive to themselves and everyone around them.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.2.3.2. Pro: Rochester in [Jane Eyre](http://www.writersalon.com/literary_criticism/edward-rochester-the-ironic-hero-of-jane-eyre) physically and emotionally abuses Jane and his wife throughout the book.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.3. Pro: Literature is [mirroring society](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2772244?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) by reflecting its norms and values, among other things.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.3.1. Con: The Godfather is an example of art influencing reality. The portrayal of Italian Americans and Mafioso in the movie [influenced](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-is-the-godfather-effect-83473971/) both how Americans viewed Italian-Americans and how the Mafia viewed themselves. Art actually created mannerisms and introduced new things like the word "Godfather" which was taken upon by the actual Mafia. Perhaps literature only portrays BDSM as abusive not because it is true, but because it sells.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.3.2. Pro: In the case of BDSM if the author of said texts is not a BDSM practiser themselves the text may mirror myths about BDSM rather than the activity itself.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.3.2.1. Pro: Shylock in the Merchant of Venice portrays clearly myths and stereotypes about Jews at the time it was written. Due to this, it was later efficiently used as Nazi [propaganda](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/04/theater/theater-shylock-and-nazi-propaganda.html?pagewanted=all). This mirror of society did not show us the lives or characteristics of real Jews at that time but instead mirrored Christian stereotypes about them.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.3.2.1.1. Pro: It was unlikely Shakespeare ever met a Jew since Jews were [expelled](http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item103483.html) from England in 1290. Without any first-hand contact, Shakespeare’s portrayal of Shylock would have had to be based entirely on folk knowledge and stereotypes.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.4. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4.2.1.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.5. Pro: Such books are written with profit in mind. Due to this, writers tend to produce material that blurs the lines between right and wrong so as to create plot twists and drama which draw larger audiences.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.5.1. Pro: Books written with such intentions on BDSM are likely to paint a biased, harmful or incomplete picture on what BDSM practices are like when practiced responsibly.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.5.2. Con: Fifty Shades of Grey, arguably the most successful BDSM novel in recent history, started as fan fiction and was published without an agent. Clearly, the profitability of this story was a [surprise](http://www.businessinsider.com/fifty-shades-of-grey-started-out-as-twilight-fan-fiction-2015-2?IR=T).
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.5.2.1. Con: Despite being surprising, it's unimaginable that a writer would put in the work to produce a full fledged novel expecting no one to read it. E.L. James perhaps didn't anticipate Fifty Shades of Grey to do the business that it did, but probably still expected the book to reach a reasonable number of people.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.5.2.1.1. Con: Many people write purely for the sake of personal enjoyment. Journals, poems, fan fiction, manuscripts, blogs, and erotica are all types of writing that many people either chose to keep private or only expect to garner a small audience. There is no reason why novels should be any different.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.5.2.1.1.1. Pro: [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org) has become an international phenomenon. The goal is to write a novel in a month, and this is done for personal enjoyment rather than attracting a large audience.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.5.2.2. Pro: The relationship between Bella and Edward described in the Twilight trilogy, which inspired Fifty Shades of Grey, is also [abusive](https://jezebel.com/5415325/twilights-hero-is-abusive-which-makes-him-all-the-more-romantic) and reproduces established "romance" tropes, such as co-dependent behavior.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.5.3. Pro: In order to create drama in a book it is often necessary to create conflict in the story's main relationships. In order to do this it is often necessary for one of the characters to act in a problematic manner.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.5.4. Pro: Complex, troubled characters are often more interesting to read about than stable, responsible characters.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.5.4.1. Pro: Christian Grey from the 50 Shades trilogy and O from The Story of O are such characters.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.5.4.5.2.2.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.7. Pro: Fictional books should not be viewed as a true representation of certain groups as they are in their essence fiction.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.7.1. Pro: Authors of fiction have to write material that will sell in the marketplace and are incentivised to make their stories as dramatic and over the top as possible.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.8. Con: It it unfair to take examples of books about an abusive relationship and label them as representative of the entire BDSM genre as many authors are not themselves practitioners.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.8.1. Pro: Fifty Shades of Grey grew out of Twilight fan-fiction, [written by a woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._L._James) who does not practice or know anything about BDSM. She just inserted some of her fantasies into an abusive relationship story.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.8.2. Con: Even though they might not be intended as such, these books are sources of information on BDSM for a significant number of people.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.9. Pro: A recent example is the Fifty Shades of Grey book and film series.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.9.1. Pro: In Fifty Shades of Grey, Christian stalks Ana, and [emotionally abuses](https://relevantmagazine.com/culture/film/fifty-shades-grey-and-abuse) her by controlling her diet and movements, isolating her from her friends and family, and threatening her.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.9.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.5.4.8.1.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.9.3. Pro: [Isolation](https://www.healthyplace.com/blogs/verbalabuseinrelationships/2011/11/isolation-is-key-for-the-ability-to-abuse/) is a strong indicator of an abusive relationship. Christian’s “non-disclosure” agreement  where he tells Anastasia that she’s not allowed to discuss their relationship with any outsiders, including friends and family, effectively isolated her from her external support systems.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.9.3.1. Con: Many relationships are within isolated circumstances. While isolation may facilitate the carrying out of abuse, an isolated relationship is in no way automatically abusive.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.9.3.1.1. Pro: Homosexual relationships within many countries where homosexuality has not been decriminalized is held within isolated and limited environments. However, one could hardly say that those relationships are inherently abusive as a result.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.9.3.1.2. Pro: The tale of Romeo and Juliet has various versions in various cultures. The central idea within all of them however, is an isolated relationship between two unlikely individuals from families who are warring. The isolation there however is glamorized and idolized for its purity, it would be unfair to not give the same leeway to BDSM relationships as normal ones.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.9.3.1.3. Con: There is a difference between isolation that occurs due to externalities and isolation that is forced upon someone by their partner. The latter was the case in the relationship between Ana and Christian, which is what makes it an abusive one.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.9.4. Pro: In the book, Christian was extremely possessive of Ana and does his best to keep her under his power. He intimidates her and carries her when she does not want to go with him.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.9.5. Pro: Christian stalks Anastasia. He shows up to meet her unannounced over and over again. He shows up at her apartment, her office and her mother's house. He also repeatedly calls her when she won’t respond and doesn't want to talk to him.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.9.6. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.5.2.4.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.10. Con: Just as many \(fictional\) books about BDSM describe healthy consensual relationships, therefore literature is not a reliable means of determining whether or not BDSM is an abusive practice in real life.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.10.1. Pro: ['The Story of O'](http://lgbt.wikia.com/wiki/Story_of_O), which is one of the most internationally famous novels about BDSM, portrays a good consensual relationship in which O's permission is requested prior to every action.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.10.1.1. Con: In The Story of O, however, O's choices are to either consent or leave the relationship. Arguably, that invalidates any consent given.
1.3.3.1.1.5.4.10.1.1.1. Pro: In a key scene, O admits that neither the men who request her consent nor she herself ever even doubt that she will consent.
1.3.3.1.1.5.5. Con: There are some portrayals of BDSM relationships in popular culture that are made responsibly and are fairly accurate.
1.3.3.1.1.5.5.1. Pro: In the TV show [Billions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_\(TV_series\)), two of the lead characters share a slave-mistress BDSM relationship.
1.3.3.1.1.5.5.1.1. Pro: Billions has been praised for its balanced and classy portrayal of this rather taboo subject.
1.3.3.1.1.5.5.1.2. Pro: Actress [Maggie Siff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Siff), who plays one of the characters in this relationship [publicly revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuiNcBxlmHI) that the producers had a consulting Dominatrix on set to ensure authenticity and to avoid mischaracterization of BDSM practices.
1.3.3.1.1.5.6. Pro: Most BDSM fiction is written by vanilla people for vanilla people. It is not about what BDSM is, it is about what they think it is.
1.3.3.1.1.6. Con: Without the correct usage of safety guidelines and reliable information about BDSM, novices do run a greater risk of making mistakes. However, this has nothing to do with BDSM, as everyone is more prone to making mistakes during the learning stages of any activity.
1.3.3.1.2. Con: Within the BDSM community, there are precautions and guidelines you are encouraged to follow to prevent such fatal accidents from occurring.
1.3.3.2. Pro: Many things that adults choose to do have a small chance of death \(skydiving, skiing, etc\).
1.3.4. Pro: BDSM involves many situations which push boundaries, such as people being tied up or beaten. It can be easy for a person to be carried away and go too far.
1.3.4.1. Pro: Dominant participants may experience [dom space](https://www.kinkly.com/definition/14325/dom-space) and not be able to utilize the safety tactics that are intended to keep them from taking a scene too far.
1.3.4.2. Con: The BDSM community have systems and practices in place in order to prevent their activities from diverging into abuse and/or become dangerous for the people involved.
1.3.4.2.1. Pro: [Aftercare](http://bdsmwiki.info/Aftercare), which is when one partner \(usually the top\) utilizes various pampering techniques on the other to ensure their comfort and safety following an intense BDSM experience, is an important system to keep practitioners physically and psychologically safe and healthy.
1.3.4.2.1.1. Con: To an outsider, the practice of "aftercare" might seem similar to rapists [caring](https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/10/13/16465064/harvey-weinstein-rape-allegations-asia-argento) for their victims in order to ensure their silence and cooperation.
1.3.4.2.1.1.1. Pro: Rapists sometimes care for their victims after the rape in order to psychologically and emotionally secure the victims.
1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: The [rape culture](https://undertheropes.com/2016/04/01/rape-culture-in-thailand/) in Thailand as popularized by the media is such that people believe the way for a man to win over a woman is to first rape her so as to claim her, then treat her lovingly and apologetically afterwards in order to secure emotional attachment.
1.3.4.2.1.2. Con: BDSM practices must be abusive if practitioners need to be pampered to ensure their physical and psychological safety and health.
1.3.4.2.1.2.1. Con: [Aftercare functions as a recalibration for the normalcy](https://www.lelo.com/blog/bdsm-beginners-aftercare/) of a relationship. While one may want one's partner to dress as a demanding authoritarian who exacts humiliating punishments on them during kinky play, that’s not how one may want them to treat them during the normal course of their relationship.
1.3.4.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: During "Aftercare" BDSM partners are encouraged to debrief and reflect on their activities and how they made each other feel.
1.3.4.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: This creates a stronger level of trust between BDSM partners.
1.3.4.2.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: Through the debriefing BDSM participants maintain continuous consent throughout their relationship.
1.3.4.2.1.2.1.1.3. Pro: This emphasis on communication means that BDSM partners are more likely to be able to vocalise their limits and feel comfortable changing them.
1.3.4.2.1.2.1.1.4. Pro: Aftercare can help participants deal with the physical toll of the kink scene together.
1.3.4.2.1.2.1.1.4.1. Pro: [Many people](https://www.lelo.com/blog/bdsm-beginners-aftercare/) compare the sensation immediately following a scene as being similar to sensations felt after an intense athletic performance.
1.3.4.2.2. Con: All of these safe guards have been incorporated to prevent against abuse. Yet the need for them to be in place reflects on the underlying abusive tendencies present in BDSM.
1.3.4.2.2.1. Con: They are needed to prevent abuse from occurring, not to hide "the underlying abusive tendencies".
1.3.4.2.3. Con: A [survey](https://ncsfreedom.org/images/stories/pdfs/Consent%20Counts/CC_Docs_New_011513/consent%20survey%20analysis.pdf) found that 30 percent of people who participated in BDSM had their pre-negotiated boundaries violated by a partner. This demonstrates that not all people who join these communities are willing to abide by the expected rules.
1.3.4.2.3.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.
1.3.4.2.3.2. Con: Rape and abuse are prevalent all over the world. BDSM does not encourage people to break pre-negotiated boundaries, the main concern should be arresting those who do not practise consensual sex.
1.3.4.2.4. Con: Many times this extra level of trust is not present, resulting in abusive situations. It is very important to define the boundaries beforehand via extensive [negotiations](http://bdsmwiki.info/Negotiations). Yet if these negotiations do not happen, there is a risk of a misunderstanding resulting in acts being performed that one party is not comfortable with.
1.3.4.2.4.1. Pro: There have been many reported instances of [abuse](http://observer.com/2012/11/the-story-of-no-sadomasochistic-sex-clubs-sprout-up-on-ivy-campuses-and-coercion-becomes-an-issue/) due to unclear boundaries, or boundaries not being respected.
1.3.4.2.5. Pro: People who engage in BDSM are frequently trained to use "[anti-abusive communication tactics](http://clarissethorn.com/2009/04/30/evidence-that-the-bdsm-community-does-not-enable-abuse/)" such as safe words in order to ensure that they communicate well and do not misunderstand each other.
1.3.4.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.3.4.2.5.2. Con: Participants in a scene can experience "[subspace](http://bdsmwiki.info/Sub_Space)", a high caused by endorphins and adrenaline. If this happens they may not be in a position to stop the scene.
1.3.4.2.5.2.1. Con: This is why limits are set, so if they do get to this circumstance a safeword is not needed and the dominant knows when to stop without prompting by the submissive.
1.3.4.2.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.1.2.1.1.
1.3.4.2.7. Pro: The [Lesbian Sex Mafia](http://lesbiansexmafia.org/bdsm/), a BDSM group in NYC, has a page on its website devoted to the difference between BDSM and abuse. This aids newcomers to the community to engage in safe consensual BDSM.
1.3.4.2.8. Pro: The Network/La Red distributes anti-abuse [pamphlets](http://clarissethorn.com/2009/04/30/evidence-that-the-bdsm-community-does-not-enable-abuse/) at various dungeons, BDSM workshops, and other BDSM community spaces.
1.3.4.2.9. Pro: A [BDSM](http://www.leatherleadership.org/library/diffsmabuse.htm) and fetish group released an Abuse Policy Statement with principles and guidelines which are intended to educate on abuse and help people understand the difference between abusive relationships and BDSM.
1.3.4.2.10. Pro: One of the main principles of BDSM is [SSC - safe, sane, consensual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe,_sane_and_consensual). The term was coined in 1983 by [david stei](http://boybear.us/ssc.pdf)n for a community purpose statement, and has been adopted internationally.
1.3.4.2.10.1. Con: It is a main principle but sadly it is not always [practiced.](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/kink-bdsm-consent-problem/)
1.3.4.2.10.1.1. Con: The ignoring of protective guidelines for certain activities is regrettable, but does not automatically make that activity inherently abusive.
1.3.5. Pro: When a dominant partner goes too far, it can be difficult for the submissive partner to realize that it is the dom's fault and not their own for not setting clear [boundaries](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/kwkkea/abusive-bdsm-relationships-do-exist-despite-what-community-says-784).
1.3.5.1. Con: This could be [avoided](http://www.masterdale.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=3247) by restating boundaries more thoroughly.
1.3.5.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.3.
1.3.5.2. Con: That is why the safeword is the most important thing in BDSM. The sub must trust their partner to honor it and the dom must trust the sub to use it, if things get too far.
1.3.5.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.5.2.1.
1.3.6. Con: Being overwhelmed or hurt unexpectedly is not exclusive to a BDSM relationship. Being unprepared or hurt is something that may occur in any relationship, including those containing no aspect of physical intimacy whatsoever.
1.4. Pro: It is impossible to meaningfully consent to being harmed.
1.4.1. Con: In appropriate BDSM practice, participants freely express and negotiate their desires, and limits. This means that all involved in the agreed-upon act set specific goals determining what they want to get out of the session—both emotionally and physically.
1.4.1.1. Pro: If BDSM is practised properly then it is fully consensual and just simulating forced obedience. A contract is often written up beforehand and agreed upon limitations set.
1.4.1.1.1. Con: Most BDSM practitioners don't enforce a formal contract; so although they've presumably discussed limits ahead of time and will stick within the realm of consent, most of their activity in a scene will still be spontaneous.
1.4.1.1.1.1. Pro: Without the enforcement of a formal contract, BDSM relationships can escalate from enjoyable to abusive very quickly.
1.4.1.1.1.2. Con: Just because a number of BDSM practitioners do not follow the rules connected to BDSM does not mean that BDSM itself is abusive. It simply means that those who do not practise BDSM correctly can accidentally engage in abuse rather than BDSM.
1.4.1.2. Pro: For long-term consent, a "[Slave Contract](https://www.kinkly.com/definition/1177/contract-bdsm)" is sometimes used. Even though BDSM contracts are not legally binding, they enforce consent between participants. They define the nature and limits of the relationship.
1.4.1.2.1. Con: Slavery contracts are dangerous and immoral because they remove the right of the 'slave' to withdraw consent during the contract, while legal standards generally allow someone to withdraw consent at any time.
1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: The above claim works for [this](https://www.evilmonk.org/a/contract01.cfm) one specific sample contract, however, that may not be representative of all slave contracts, some of which may be better phrased and which may afford more protection to the practitioners involved.
1.4.1.2.1.2. Con: In responsibly executed BDSM relationships, the submissive partner always retains the legal right of last refusal, regardless of what the contract states, as such slave [contracts](http://bdsmwiki.info/Slave_contract) are not legally binding. It follows that the right to withdraw consent remains intact but voluntarily is not invoked in most instances.
1.4.1.2.2. Con: This [sample](https://www.evilmonk.org/a/contract01.cfm) slave contract allows the 'master' to give "any punishment the master decides to inflict, whether earned or not," aside from some very limited restrictions. This is dangerous and unfair.
1.4.1.3. Con: Negotiating the terms of abuse can still make the actions performed abusive.
1.4.1.4. Pro: BDSM scenarios are often simulated and essentially pretend: participants know exactly what is going to happen and, moreover, know that it is not really real.
1.4.1.4.1. Con: Simulating abuse is still abuse despite consent; two or more partners are just consenting to abuse.
1.4.1.4.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.
1.4.1.4.1.2. Con: Certain careers, include acting and law enforcement, require employees to simulate physically  [abusive actions](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/27/why-do-plays-about-sex-and-violence-written-by-women-still-shock-sarah-kane-cleansed) in certain situations; but since these are mere simulations and consent is always given, these situations are not considered to be abuse.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1. Pro: Certain plays require actors to be [bound](https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/theatre-arts/a-mouth-and-she-is-not-afraid-to-use-it-30456964.html) for long periods of time. This is not considered abusive as they are consenting and safe, but there is very little difference between this and some bondage play.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1. Con: An actor on stage isn't subjected to the same pressures a BDSM submissive feels when they are bound.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: An actor has the ability to escape into a particular character, whereas when a submissive is being bound, it is their personhood that is being attacked.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con: Actors are often expected to - and do - [blend](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/15971/16023) with the character they are playing.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Pro: Many actors report that their job takes a heavy emotional [toll](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/11/actors-emotions-on-stage-kate-fleetwood-michelle-terry-ben-miles) on them.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1.2. Pro: An actor on stage almost never has to bare their body for the audience or other participants.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: BDSM submissives often consent to baring their bodies when commanded by their dominants. This sometimes happens in front of an audience as well.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1.2.2. Con: TV and film actors are frequently asked to film nude scenes; and if an actor/actress wants to avoid this, then they have to ensure that there are specific [nudity clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity_clause) in their contract.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1.3. Con: Just like in acting, many BDSM scenes are highly choreographed beforehand. In this way, these two practices are actually quite similar.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1.3.1. Pro: Much like an actual script, a [BDSM activity contract](https://bdsmcontracts.org/bondage-contract-clause-for-mistress-slave-scenes/) clearly lays out what both parties have consented to and can expect to happen when a scene plays out.
1.4.1.4.1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.1.
1.4.1.4.1.2.2. Pro: [Models](https://unclem.deviantart.com/journal/Is-the-bondage-real-how-long-are-they-tied-up-256339230) are sometimes required to be tied up and kept in restrictive positions for long periods of time. This is particularly true for [Fetish models](http://www.rope-bondage.com/model-wanted.html), who cannot fake the positions they are in for a shoot.
1.4.1.4.1.2.3. Pro: Certain military personnel and private military contractors go through [SERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival,_Evasion,_Resistance_and_Escape#Resistance_and_escape) training -- a grueling program meant to teach survival, resistance, and evasion tactics to those who are high risk of capture.
1.4.1.4.1.2.4. Pro: Professional athletes [undergo](https://www.forbes.com/2008/07/08/training-perfect-athlete-olympics08-forbeslife-cx_avd_0708health.html) strict training regimes and intensive fitness programs along with a very controlled diet that restricts them from doing most things other people do.
1.4.1.4.1.3. Con: Pain and humiliation is not abuse if you like it and willingly receive it.
1.4.1.4.1.3.1. Pro: [Erotic humiliation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_humiliation), for example. is for the purpose of pleasure and sexual arousal/excitement. In this way, it is not considered abuse.
1.4.1.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: In some practices, the Dom may urinate or even defecate on the Sub in a scene for the purposes of humiliation.
1.4.1.4.1.3.2. Pro: The infliction or reception of pain ceases to be painful if the negative connotations associated with pain are removed. Inflicting pain is seen as abusive because it is the causing of discomfort to a person despite them not agreeing to it. When that consent is provided, the negative connotations of pain cease to be and therefore the pain instead becomes a pleasurable act.
1.4.1.4.1.4. Pro: Abuse is defined [as](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS752US753&ei=nPIYWoG1EsKRsAfy_5KgDw&q=definition%2Bof%2Babuse&oq=definition%2Bof%2Babuse&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i30k1l10.14848.15972.0.16928.5.5.0.0.0.0.433.787.3-1j1.2.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..3.2.783....0.ekzslOeQkww) behavior that causes physical or mental harm to another,whether intentionally or not. [Sadomasochism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism), a subset of BDSM, involves giving or receiving pleasure from acts involving the receipt or infliction of pain or humiliation
1.4.1.4.1.4.1. Pro: [Torture](http://www.bdsmwiki.info/Torture) is a common practice within BDSM culture and circles.
1.4.1.4.1.4.2. Pro: Consensual [slavery](http://www.bdsmwiki.info/Principles_of_slavery#Best_Practices:_Principles_of_Slavery) and [total power exchange](http://bdsmwiki.info/TPE) is also often practiced within the context of BDSM.
1.4.1.4.1.4.3. Pro: BDSM includes the practice of [abduction](https://archives.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2012/12/03/taken-the-secret-world-of-abduction-fantasies).
1.4.1.4.1.4.3.1. Con: Abduction fantasies are negotiated in advance and take place in controlled environments.
1.4.1.4.1.4.4. Con: Under that definition a doctor abuses a patient when relocating a joint, or injecting them with medicine. Abuse implies that the harm caused was not consented to, which is not the case in a BDSM scene.
1.4.1.4.1.5. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.
1.4.1.4.1.6. Con: Being abusive is ok provided the abuse is consensual.
1.4.1.4.1.6.1. Con: Consent does not equal lack of harm. Someone can consent to something and then be seriously [harmed](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=4285958&page=1) by it, mentally or physically.
1.4.1.4.1.7. Con: You cannot consent to abuse the same way you cannot consent to rape: because the definition itself implies the lack of consent. If every party has consented, it is not abuse.
1.4.1.5. Pro: The process of negotiation makes BDSM practice different from abuse as abuse can in no way be negotiated before it happens.
1.4.1.5.1. Con: Abuse is inherent to the action itself, not the agreement around it. Therefore abuse can be negotiated.
1.4.2. Pro: Choice is meaningless if it occurs within a [system of oppression](http://www.creativeconflictresolution.org/jc/maps-1/systems-of-oppression.html), so a person in a less [privileged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_\(social_inequality\)) position can never meaningfully consent to BDSM practices.
1.4.2.1. Con: When faced with oppression, a person can still meaningfully choose how to respond to it.
1.4.2.2. Con: Since the entire world exists within a system of oppression, if the parent claim were true, it would mean no one could ever meaningfully consent into anything, which is untrue.
1.4.2.2.1. Pro: There are numerous examples of oppressed people making meaningful choices while under oppression, such as the practice of non-violent action and civil disobedience in the Indian independence movement and the civil rights movements of the 20th centuries.
1.4.2.3. Con: Surely the logical conclusion of this claim is that a person in a less privileged position can never meaningfully consent to sex or to any kind of romantic relationship.
1.4.2.3.1. Pro: The implication of saying that no-one in a less privileged position can consent to BDSM is that a woman could never consent to sex with a man because her less privileged position would remove her ability to choose.
1.4.2.4. Con: A healthy BDSM relationship doesn't contain a partner less privileged than the other in the context of their relationship. Submission does not equate a loss of privilege or even power.
1.4.3. Con: It is meaningful to consent to activities that carry the risk of harm.
1.4.3.1. Con: The government, through laws, often decides that citizens cannot meaningfully consent into some activities, considered bad for society on aggregate. Gambling and drug consumption are examples of such activities.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: The fact that the government currently regulates consent does not mean that it should.
1.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.4.4. Con: If there is no consent it is not BDSM. Consent is paramount to a proper BDSM relationship.
1.4.4.1. Pro: Consent is the cornerstone of any BDSM relationship. Often participants enter a contract as equals before any action is taken in serious relationships of the sort. Even in casual encounters participants agree ahead of time what is acceptable and what is not. This is called reviewing of Hard and Soft Boundaries.
1.4.4.2. Con: Given consent can always be abused or mitigated in a number of ways.
1.4.4.2.1. Pro: A dominant can breach contract and claim that it is within their right to do so.
1.4.4.2.2. Pro: A contract can be poorly constructed to give the dominant undue control of an already unbalanced situation.
1.4.4.2.2.1. Con: It is the submissive who ultimately establishes the limits of a BDSM scene. In other words, the submissive overrules the dominant and can impose their own conditions.
1.4.4.2.2.1.1. Con: Even though there are limits established that doesn't mean these limits cannot be broken accidentally especially in a community where they are [encouraged to be pushed](https://www.kinkly.com/definition/12059/pushing-limits). Although caution is advised, mistakes do happen.
1.4.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.3.
1.4.4.2.2.1.2. Pro: BDSM practices don't usually support trespassing limits since they are applied with consent. Limits infringed by accident are not predictable. Of course there are risks, but when people accept them, they're aware of them and can have contingencies in place to avoid them.
1.4.4.2.2.1.2.1. Con: Pushing limits is [encouraged](http://www.makesexeasy.com/pushing-boundaries-bdsm-mean/) in the BDSM community. Although consent is encouraged, so is development in your preferred BDSM activity. It is comparable to building up fitness, gradually increasing your workout to see how much you improve.
1.4.4.2.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Pushing limits too quickly blurs the line between consent and abuse.
1.4.4.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro: If inherent to BDSM practices and the community, the practice of pushing personal limits can be coercive. This severely mitigates arguments defending BDSM as non-abusive because participants consent into practices.
1.4.4.2.2.1.3. Pro: The BDSM community itself [strongly](http://www.spankfestival.com/generaletiquette.pdf) [encourages](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-rules-for-BDSM) practitioners to negotiate their personal limits before engaging in BDSM to ensure that no serious harm or violations of consent occur.
1.4.4.2.3. Pro: For example, participants could be misled about a scene by abusers posing as dominants.
1.4.4.2.3.1. Con: In this situation the participants would not be engaging in BDSM. One person would have been manipulated and abused by another under the guise of BDSM.
1.4.4.2.3.1.1. Con: Scope for this kind of abuse to be perpetuated quite easily is evidence that BDSM is an abusive and dangerous activity.
1.4.4.2.4. Con: There is potential for this to happen in any kind of sexual relationship. Breaches of consent are not an issue of BDSM, they are an issue of abuse and disrespect in relationships.
1.4.4.3. Pro: Only when prearranged limits of consent have been breached is any practice involving control \(physically or mentally\) over another abusive. Misunderstandings about where this limit lies is where the problem tends to crop up.
1.4.4.3.1. Con: If misunderstanding leading to abuse is prevalent within the practice, or is highly likely, then the practice can in generally be regarded as abusive.
1.4.4.3.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.3.
1.4.4.3.3. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.5.2.
1.4.4.3.4. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.4.
1.4.4.4. Pro: People involved can stop at any time if they wish as they are taking part for mutual enjoyment.
1.4.4.4.1. Pro: In responsible BDSM practice, the submissive has a safe-word that allows them to stop the scene at any time they need to for physical or emotional reasons. A person being abused cannot stop what is happening.
1.4.4.5. Pro: Many practitioners of BDSM adhere to the principle of [RACK - risk-aware consensual kink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-aware_consensual_kink).
1.4.4.6. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.10.
1.4.5. Pro: There is legal precedent to say that consenting to abuse is not possible.
1.4.5.1. Pro: Even though his victim repeatedly consented to be cannibalized by him, [Armin Meiwes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armin_Meiwes) was indicted and sentenced by a German court.
1.4.5.1.1. Con: However, he initially was sentenced for manslaughter, not murder, because of the consent given by his victim. So a court considered this consent valid enough to issue a lighter sentence than requested by the state.
1.4.5.1.2. Con: This is an incredibly unique and extreme case, and as such it should not be considered the archetype by which to determine whether consent in BDSM is meaningful.
1.4.5.1.3. Con: This just means that it is impossible to legally consent to this, not that such consent isn't legitimate or meaningful.
1.4.5.1.3.1. Con: The law is a fair indicator of what kinds of actions can be consented into.
1.4.5.2. Pro: In [R v Brown](https://www.princeton.edu/~ereading/ReginaVBrown.pdf) a UK court found that consensual sadomasochistic activity among gay men was illegal.
1.4.5.2.1. Con: Courts around the world have found homosexuality in all its forms to be illegal as well. This could be more about homosexuality than BDSM.
1.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association \(ILGA\) found that as of 2016, same-sex sexual contact was a criminal offence in [74 countries](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/gay-lesbian-bisexual-relationships-illegal-in-74-countries-a7033666.html).
1.4.5.2.1.2. Pro: In [13 countries](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/gay-lesbian-bisexual-relationships-illegal-in-74-countries-a7033666.html), being gay or bisexual is punishable by death.
1.4.5.2.1.3. Pro: A total of [40 countries](http://lgbtbar.org/what-we-do/programs/gay-and-trans-panic-defense/) have a legal '[gay panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense)' provision which allows people to use the fact that they were provoked because a person was gay, lesbian or bisexual as a defense for committing assault or murder
1.4.5.2.1.3.1. Pro: In 2013, a gay panic defense was used in connection with the [murder of Mississippi mayoral candidate](http://lgbtbar.org/what-we-do/programs/gay-and-trans-panic-defense/) Marco McMillian. McMillian was the state’s first openly gay candidate for office. Lawrence Reed, the man who admitted to killing McMillian, claimed that McMillian’s unwanted sexual advances were to blame for his death.
1.4.5.2.1.3.2. Con: Countries that allowed gay panic defenses are amending laws to ensure that they are not abused or removing them entirely.
1.4.5.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: In [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense), Victoria passed reforms in 2005, followed by Western Australia in 2008 and Queensland in 2017 \(with a clause to allow it in 'exceptional circumstances' to be determined by a magistrate\).
1.4.5.2.1.3.2.2. Pro: The State of California and more recently, The Illinois House of Representatives has unanimously passed a bill prohibiting the “gay panic” defense.
1.4.5.2.1.3.2.2.1. Con: The gay panic defense is [still admissible](http://www.newnownext.com/illinois-just-outlawed-the-gay-panic-defense-but-its-still-legal-in-48-states/06/2017/) in the other 48 states in the United States.
1.4.5.2.2. Con: This case is not one of controversy over BDSM, but one of homophobia and prejudice.
1.4.5.3. Con: The opinions of lawmakers or courts does not make BDSM inherently abusive.
1.4.5.3.1. Con: Law makers, through the laws they make, dictate what actions/practices are inappropriate or abusive in all other aspects of society and BDSM is no different.
1.4.6. Con: There are different kinds of consent that govern healthy BDSM relationships.
1.4.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.1.
1.4.6.2. Pro: Temporary consent for BDSM actions is granted only for a stipulated period of time like an hour or for an evening. When a scene lasts for more than a few hours, some might decide to draft a "[scene contract](http://thebdsmgarden.com/efiction/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=8&sid=66&chapter=all)" that defines what will happen and who is responsible for what.
1.4.6.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.5.
1.4.6.4. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.4.6.5. Pro: [Consensual non-consent](https://blog.cuff-link.me/2016/11/28/controversial-kink-series-consensual-non-consent/), which has different iterations, is most commonly known as a style of BDSM play in which the participants agree to behave in a manner that mimics non-consensual behavior for the duration of a scene \(or until a safe-word is used\).
1.4.6.5.1. Pro: Total Power Exchange \(TPE\) relationships enforce a highly controversial type of [CNC](http://kinkipedia.wikidot.com/wiki:consensual-non-consent) often called "blanket consent" wherein the participants act as if consent has been waived. It is an agreement where comprehensive consent is given in advance, with the intent of it being irrevocable under most circumstances; and this often occurs without foreknowledge of the exact actions planned.
1.4.6.5.1.1. Con: Blanket consent is [frowned upon](http://kinkipedia.wikidot.com/wiki:consensual-non-consent) by much of the BDSM community for fear of abuse and participants' safety, as it can easily violate SSC guidelines.
1.4.6.5.1.2. Con: Blanket consent is dangerous because it does not allow the waiving party to withdraw their consent. If 'comprehensive consent' is given in advance, this means that someone could consent to something in advance and be unable to change their mind later if it hurts them.
1.4.6.5.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.4.6.5.2. Pro: In consensual non consent, the scene may have the appearance of being very violent, and without the consent of one party.
1.4.6.5.2.1. Pro: For example, rape play is a form of consensual non-consent, which also includes  activities like psychological/emotional control.
1.4.6.5.2.2. Con: The operative word in your argument is "appearance." Appearances aren't always representative of reality
1.4.7. Con: -> See 1.1.2.1.5.
1.4.8. Con: In some acting situations performers consent to harm in order to make their performance more believable. This is accepted in modern society.
1.4.8.1. Pro: Natasha Campbell-Hughes in the filming of [3096](https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/film/antonia-campbell-hughes-why-i-m-starving-for-this-role-7896277.html), in order to represent her character as accurately as possible, had her director starve her and use the same techniques that interrogators use to break soldiers. This meant that she would experience similar torture to that of the woman on whom her character was based.
1.4.8.1.1. Pro: Campbell-Hughes suffered cuts, bruises, a torn Achilles tendon, a broken toe and a fractured rib through the filming period.
1.4.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
1.4.8.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.2.2.2.
1.5. Pro: The relationship dynamics in a BDSM relationship are often abusive.
1.5.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.1.
1.5.2. Pro: A large number of BDSM practices are based on abuse and humiliation by definition.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The sexual act of causing someone to pass out, or begin to lose consciousness, by restricting the blood flow to their brain is called “erotic asphyxiation” and is a widely debated practice in the kink community.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: The pleasure of erotic asphyxiation comes with the additional flow of oxygen to the brain when the choke is released, giving the person a heightened sense of pleasure. This incentivizes participants to prolong the choking as long as possible, as more oxygen results in more pleasure. When [done incorrectly, this can have disastrous effects](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-dangerous-appeal-of-choking), from unconsciousness to even death.
1.5.2.1.2. Con: Many in the BDSM community are against erotic asphyxiation and those who approve of it encourage strict [guidelines of safe play.](http://www.popularirony.com/2011/12/auto-erotic-asphyxiation-safe-way.html)
1.5.2.1.2.1. Con: This does not negate the fact that this abusive activity is a part of BDSM practices.
1.5.2.2. Pro: BDSM play involves varying degrees of restriction of movement through [bondage play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondage_\(BDSM\)).
1.5.2.2.1. Pro: Restricting or controlling someone's freedom of movement by tying them up constitutes abuse in most instances.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: There is a good reason why the above claim says 'most' and not 'all'. There is nothing inherently wrong with bondage as long as there is mutual trust and consent between parties.
1.5.2.3. Pro: [Impact play](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sandra-lamorgese-phd/impact-play_b_9059108.html) is a kind of kink that involves the deriving of sexual pleasure through being hit with objects, which can range from canes, to paddles, whips and chains.
1.5.2.4. Pro: Some BDSM practices also incorporate tenants of ownership through sex slaves. Submissive partners wear collars which represents someone’s identity as a submissive and/or owned person.
1.5.2.4.1. Con: They play these roles in "scenes". Once a scene is over the normal dynamic of the relationship. The submissive, who often is the one in ownership is the one who has the power to end a scene whenever they want. [They set all limitations.](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-submissive-purportedly-have-the-power-in-a-BDSM-relationship-when-they-are-expected-to-obey-every-dom-command-without-hesitation)
1.5.2.4.1.1. Con: In total power exchange relationships \([TPE](http://dominantguide.com/encyclopedia/total-power-exchange/)\), participants adhere to a 24/7 D/s setup wherein the submissive relinquishes all power to their Dominant on a long-term basis.
1.5.2.4.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.
1.5.2.4.2. Con: Many people in successful, high-stress jobs, [choose to be a submissive](http://www.yourtango.com/2016286579/five-reasons-dominant-women-often-submissive-in-bed) and be controlled as it is refreshing to be in a position where they do not need to think for themselves.
1.5.2.4.3. Con: Submissive partners aren't just owned sex slaves. They freely give themselves to their dominant, and aren't just in the relationship for sexual reasons.
1.5.2.5. Pro: There is a host of kinks that involve playing with objects that are inherently dangerous and are often associated with abuse. Examples include fire, knives, floggers and canes.
1.5.2.5.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.4.1.3.
1.5.2.6. Pro: [Cuckolding](http://www.yourtango.com/2017299286/what-is-cuckold-and-what-makes-it-kinky-sex) often involves the humiliation of a male partner where they are made to watch or hear their partners having sex with other men.
1.5.2.6.1. Con: In the context of BDSM as a subculture, cuckolding isn't considered abusive if the parties agree on the humiliation.
1.5.2.6.1.1. Con: Just because cuckolding is considered acceptable within BDSM subcultures does not objectively make it a non-abusive activity.
1.5.2.6.2. Pro: Cuckolding is based on active humiliation where the submissive partner is often made to feel insufficient with regard to their sexual prowess.
1.5.2.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.5.2.
1.5.2.8. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.1.4.1.
1.5.2.9. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.1.4.3.
1.5.2.10. Con: -> See 1.4.1.4.1.3.
1.5.3. Con: [Studies](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12192/abstract) have found that people who participate in BDSM lifestyle are more likely to exhibit positive mental health traits.
1.5.3.1. Pro: In [comparison](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201502/the-surprising-psychology-bdsm) to non-practitioners, BDSM practitioners exhibited higher levels of extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and subjective well-being.
1.5.4. Con: One of the tenants which can make an action abusive is that it cannot be negotiated in advance. However, all actions taken during a scene are [negotiated](http://theaquinian.net/bdsm-stereotypes-perpetuated-media/) before they happen. As such, they are not abusive actions.
1.5.4.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.1.
1.5.5. Con: Abusive episodes are out of control situations. In healthy BDSM, the dominant partner is never expected to act spontaneously out of anger.
1.5.5.1. Pro: BDSM practices are usually pre-planned with the best interest of all parties in mind.
1.5.5.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.5.6. Pro: Submissives in BDSM relationships give their partners a huge amount of control and power over them. It is easy - and likely common - for that power to be abused.
1.5.6.1. Con: The level and duration of control is predetermined and they can revoke their consent at any time.
1.5.6.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.5.
1.5.6.2. Con: That is why a healthy BDSM relationship must be based upon trust. While the dominant partner has cotrol over the situation, it must ultimately be the sub who decides what is still acceptable and what is not.
1.5.7. Con: Abusive situations usually end with negative emotions whereas BDSM is designed to be a positive experience for all involved.
1.5.7.1. Con: The way BDSM is designed and the way it actually works in practice are two completely different things.
1.5.7.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.1.
1.5.7.1.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.5.2.
1.5.7.1.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.
1.5.7.2. Pro: Those who are abused usually feel fear or lingering trauma after the experience. Submissives in BDSM practices are usually left feeling [happy and emotionally satisfied](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201502/the-surprising-psychology-bdsm).
1.5.7.3. Pro: Abusers usually feel emotions of anger, hatred or guilt after perpetrating abuse, while dominants feel satisfied after a BDSM experience.
1.5.7.4. Pro: Those who are abused never want to relive the experience, but BDSM submissives are usually open to repeating or reliving their experiences.
1.5.7.4.1. Con: Many victims of abuse inadvertently [reenact](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3330499/) their trauma in later life. Arguably, some people might seek out BDSM in their relationships to create situations that will echo their previous traumatic experiences.
1.5.7.4.2. Con: Some people practice BDSM to gain control over trauma by reenacting it as part of therapeutic practices. \([Weiss](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Techniques-of-Pleasure/), pp. 146-148\).
1.5.7.4.2.1. Pro: In the study, Weiss describes the case of a couple who reenact the woman's childhood trauma of incestuous rape. To make the scene possible, the man, Anthony, has to separate the horror of the real events "somewhere else". Once the scene can happen, in the couple's description, it "ceases to be 'play' and instead becomes 'fabulous,' somehow real".
1.5.7.4.3. Con: This assumes that submissives in BDSM relationships are able to consent or not consent to the actions within them. In fact, the control in their relationship may have removed that power from them.
1.5.7.4.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.6.5.1.
1.5.8. Con: BDSM has the potential to be abusive, but it is not inherently abusive as a practice.
1.5.8.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.1.4.1.3.
1.5.8.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.4.4.1.
1.5.9. Con: BDSM is about showing mutual respect for the boundaries between the parties concerned whereas abuse is about the lack of respect that one party demonstrates to the other.
1.5.10. Con: -> See 1.4.1.5.
1.5.11. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.2.1.
1.6. Pro: The practice of BDSM attracts sex offenders and exploits victims of abuse.
1.6.1. Pro: There are numerous examples of individuals [admitting](http://www.fbi.gov/kansascity/press-releases/2013/lebanon-man-pleads-guilty-faces-20-years-in-prison-for-coercing-a-minor-to-become-a-sex-slave) to, [charged](http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/aug/29/slain-marine-wife-unwilling-participant-in-sex/) with, or [convicted](http://m.ice.gov/news/releases/1302/130219baltimore.htm) of crimes ranging from sexual abuse, kidnapping, and murder all under the guise of BDSM.
1.6.1.1. Con: Just because BDSM has been misused to justify morally reprehensible actions does not inherently make it abusive to those who practice it respectfully.
1.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.3.
1.6.3. Con: [Consent is required](http://affirmativeconsent.com/bdsm-practitioners-less-likely-victim-blaming-attitudes-sexual-violence-cases/) in every step of a BDSM activity and therefore does not exploit anyone as permission is always requested and granted for the act to take place.
1.6.4. Con: Many victims of abuse have found BDSM helpful in their [recovery](https://www.pandys.org/articles/BDSM_healing.htm).
1.6.4.1. Pro: [Light/Dark therapy](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/when-bdsm-is-therapeutic/412249/) is used by the [Light Dark Institute](http://www.lightdarkinstitute.com/about/) in order to help people who suffer from a wide range of mental health problems and past abuses. This therapy integrates BDSM into treatment.
1.6.4.2. Pro: The practice of BDSM can be a healthy way to [channel](http://www.sheknows.com/love-and-sex/articles/1133375/bdsm-as-therapy) consuming negative feelings.
1.6.4.3. Pro: BDSM can allow victims of sexual abuse to [reclaim](https://www.alternet.org/how-sm-sex-helped-me-heal-my-rape) control of their sexuality in a safe and consensual environment.
1.6.4.3.1. Pro: When someone who has [experienced abuse](http://www.sheknows.com/love-and-sex/articles/1133375/bdsm-as-therapy) dominates their partner,they are in total control. Not only is this a turn-on, but it makes them feel confident about their worth and abilities.
1.6.5. Con: A [study](https://www.lelo.com/blog/six-myths-about-bdsm-debunked-by-science/) found that people who engaged in BDSM practices or fantasies report extremely low past engagement or future intention to engage in coercive sexual behaviours.
1.6.5.1. Pro: The group of people who reported nonconsensual intentions and past behaviours had fewer BDSM-related fantasies and past experiences than the BDSM practitioners and those with kinky fantasies.
1.6.6. Con: BDSM allows people with potentially harmful sexual urges a safe and consensual outlet.
1.6.7. Con: If sex offenders get attracted to BDSM, it does not make the actual act of BDSM abusive in nature, only something sex offenders misuse.
1.6.8. Pro: Today's BDSM practices were first described as psychopathological conditions.
1.6.8.1. Pro: Psychiatrist [Richard von Krafft-Ebing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Krafft-Ebing) coined the term "sadomasochism" in his work Psychopathia Sexualis in 1886.
1.6.8.1.1. Con: This work described a number of paraphilias, among them male homosexuality, which Krafft-Ebing considered a mental illness caused by degenerate heredity.
1.6.8.1.1.1. Pro: [Homosexuality](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201509/when-homosexuality-stopped-being-mental-disorder) was considered a mental illness, “sociopathic personality disturbance”, until 1973.
1.6.8.1.2. Pro: Sadism and masochism are still [disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism#Medical_and_forensic_classification) listed in the DSM-5.
1.6.8.1.2.1. Con: Consensual BDSM is explicitly excluded from the DSM-5 entry.
1.6.8.2. Con: Our understanding of psychology is constantly changing. With new information and studies we have been forced to rethink how we first categorised mental health.
1.6.8.2.1. Pro: In [2010](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/01/bdsm-versus-the-dsm/384138/) the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was changed to reflect that the mental illness depends on how it is expressed, not the behaviour itself. This change meant that BDSM actions by themselves could not be proof of mental illness.
1.6.8.2.2. Pro: Women were once diagnosed with [Hysteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480686/), which could be attributed to any woman, whether \(by today's standards\) she had an actual psychological issue or not. Hysteria's treatments ranged from the medical use of vibrators to electro-therapy or exorcisms. However, modern psychology outright dismisses such notions that were once held to high scientific regard.
1.6.8.3. Pro: The [DSM II](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/03/sexual_kinks_in_the_dsm_v_paraphilic_disorders_describe_unhappy_kinksters.html) listed homosexuality, masochism, sadism, transvestism, fetishism, and other consensual minority sexualities alongside criminal pedophilia in the category of “sexual deviations.”
1.6.8.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.8.1.2.
1.6.8.4. Con: [Recent research tells us](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201502/the-surprising-psychology-bdsm) that there is a both a positive and negative relationship between BDSM and mental conditions.
1.6.8.4.1. Pro: Better mental health has been linked to BDSM activity in many [studies.](http://www.drmichaelaaronnyc.com/study-bdsm-linked-better-mental-health/)
1.6.8.4.2. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.
1.6.8.4.3. Pro: [Compared](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201502/the-surprising-psychology-bdsm) to non BDSM practitioners those who engage in BDSM have lower levels of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological sadism, psychological masochism, borderline pathology, and paranoia.
1.6.8.4.4. Pro: [Research](https://www.verywell.com/difference-between-bdsm-and-abuse-4065395) has established that those who engage in BDSM activities have more satisfaction in their relationships and less stress than people who don't engage in these activities.
1.6.8.4.4.1. Con: This is misleading. In the [main study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23679066/) this source uses, "BDSM scores were generally more favorably for those with a dominant than a submissive role, with least favorable scores for controls."
1.6.8.4.4.1.1. Pro: According to this study, the dominant group receives the most benefits; i.e. in a consensual scene of rape, the person playing the rapist generally receives more benefits.
1.6.8.4.5. Pro: BDSM practitioners in a [study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201502/the-surprising-psychology-bdsm) show higher levels of dissociation and narcissism than non BDSM practitioners.
1.6.8.4.6. Pro: BDSM practitioners [show](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201502/the-surprising-psychology-bdsm) lower levels of agreeableness than non-practitioners.
1.6.8.4.6.1. Con: This is not a bad thing, as less agreeable people are less likely to agree to engage in an activity where they might be subject to abuse.
1.6.8.4.7. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.
1.7. Con: BDSM is a valid expression of sexuality.
1.7.1. Con: BDSM can be a valid expression of sexuality, but it is still inherently abusive. Abuse is the form of sexuality one expresses in BDSM.
1.7.1.1. Con: The BDSM community has a known set of [rules](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-common-rules-for-BDSM). Due to this, it is better for this form of sexuality to be expressed in a safe, consensual environment, which the BDSM community provide.
1.7.1.1.1. Con: The BDSM community provides rules to follow but just like any other activity with rules, there will always be people who break them. The only difference with BDSM is that it makes it very easy to turn abusive because of its violent nature.
1.7.2. Pro: Some practitioners of BDSM view kink as their [sexual orientation](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/08/18/is_kink_a_sexual_orientation.html).
1.7.2.1. Con: A kink is a way people love one another. [Sexual orientation](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation-gender/sexual-orientation) is who you are attracted to. To reduce the orientation of love to a physical technicality is as reductive and [inaccurate](http://affinitymagazine.us/2017/03/24/kink-is-not-part-of-the-lgbt-community/) as it would be to argue that homosexuality is not an orientation because penis-in-anus is merely “how” a gay man loves his husband.
1.7.2.2. Pro: Many people in the BDSM community identify as bisexual not because they are attracted to both men and women, but because they are attracted to particular personality types associated with kink such as dominant or submissive regardless of gender.
1.7.2.3. Pro: Similar to any other sexual orientation, kink is a biological desire that people are born with -- not something that they choose. The choice is whether or not to act upon those desires.
1.7.2.3.1. Con: Many people enter the BDSM scene later in life without having ever known before that it was something they desired.
1.7.2.3.1.1. Pro: Many people have to wait till they find a partner that shares similar interests before they can partake in kink.
1.7.2.3.1.2. Pro: Many people are introduced to BDSM for the first time by a partner already involved in the community, when until that point they did not know much about the community or their taste for BDSM practices.
1.7.2.4. Con: A person may designate any action or inclination as part of their identity.  Their doing so does not depend on whether the action is in fact helpful or harmful to them. The actions which comprise BDSM have the potential to be harmful — the fact that one may take pride in something which harms them does not negate the fact.
1.7.3. Pro: A lot of interpersonal growth comes from pain, discomfort and struggle. The sexual element of BDSM adds vulnerability and loss of control. Done correctly, it can become a cathartic and psychologically therapeutic experience.
1.7.3.1. Pro: -> See 1.6.8.4.1.
1.7.3.2. Con: It is difficult to determine whether the practice of BDSM is being done 'correctly' or not. The individuals partaking in the activity are not trained by some sort of overarching authority that regulates BDSM or imparts the correct way of doing it to individuals. Rather, BDSM has enough of a capacity to trigger a scarred individual as much as it does to be a therapeutic experience.
1.7.3.2.1. Pro: Other activities that carry an element of risk that may be consented to are also governed by organizations that have codes of conduct, training and enforced regulation.
1.7.3.2.1.1. Pro: Football which is a dangerous sport in which players routinely suffer injuries is regulated by [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA) which ensures that all players and stadiums have a standardised system in place to minimize injuries and centralized rules which prevent severe injuries from taking place.
1.7.3.2.1.2. Pro: After the horrific [incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Zone_accident) on the set of the movie 'The Twilight Zone' Hollywood put in place the 'Blue Book' - a set of standardized safety guidelines to ensure that such incidents would not be replicated in the future when dangerous scenes are being filmed.
1.7.3.2.1.3. Pro: Education, training and safety is a core tenant of [The Mine Safety and Health Administration](https://www.msha.gov/training-education). To make sure the MSHA functions properly, its actions are overseen by the US Department of Labour. They maintain high-quality training programs, and they strengthen and modernize training through collaboration with industry stakeholders.
1.7.3.3. Con: Despite consent, BDSM practices often reinforce flawed coping mechanisms.  So, while the choices are unforced, they are still a form of self-harm, or at best, a stopgap which delays the learning of genuine self-care practices. Similarly: people are not forced to eat McDonald's food, and most enjoy it, but it still harms them, and wastes an opportunity to eat healthily.
1.7.4. Pro: BDSM is a liberating way to express and celebrate sexuality.
1.7.4.1. Pro: People have more sexual agency within BDSM.
1.7.4.1.1. Pro: BDSM allows individuals to explore a side of their personality that would be shunned in mainstream society.
1.7.4.1.1.1. Pro: BDSM culture tends to be more accepting of alternate forms of sexuality.
1.7.4.1.1.2. Pro: BDSM subcultures provide support systems for those with uncommon fetishes or expressions of sexuality and as such, increase their sexual agency.
1.7.4.1.2. Pro: BDSM culture stigmatizes engaging in sexual acts with multiple partners far less than traditional culture.
1.7.4.1.3. Pro: BDSM helps breaks the barriers of traditional sexual roles.
1.7.4.1.3.1. Pro: BDSM breaks barriers with respect to traditional roles within sex: for example, women are able to explore their dominant sides, whereas men are able to be submissive to other's desires.
1.7.4.1.3.1.1. Pro: BDSM also encourages participants to experiment and explore different sides of their personality: "[Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top,_bottom,_switch_\(BDSM\))" or sexually versatile people can switch between being dominant and submissive.
1.7.4.1.3.1.2. Con: The [stereotype](https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/thinking-kink-female-dominant-pop-culture-sub-dom-feminist-magazine-sexuality) of the dominatrix relies on deeply conservative ideas of gender, which the dominant women then inverts: She acts "like a man".
1.7.4.2. Pro: Many people find BDSM to be a [transcendental](http://www.spiralnature.com/reviews/radical-ecstasy-dossie-easton-janet-hardy/) and spiritual experience.
1.7.4.2.1. Pro: There are faith-based groups that celebrate kink, such as [JUICE](http://jewcy.com/jewish-sex-and-love/jewish-group-sexual-outsider).
1.7.4.2.2. Pro: Participants of this [study](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14681994.2016.1205185) experienced a sense of spiritual presence, self-surrender, a transcendent state of consciousness, and lasting transformation.
1.7.4.2.3. Pro: Modern [pagans](http://www.vocativ.com/news/305430/inside-the-world-of-witches-who-practice-bdsm/) often share at least some rituals with BDSM.
1.7.4.2.4. Pro: The connection of [spirituality and pain](https://leaveshamebehind.com/2014/11/17/the-spirituality-of-pain/) has a long history in faith traditions and cultures.
1.7.4.2.5. Pro: [Results](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201502/the-surprising-psychology-bdsm) of a study revealed that both bottoms and tops entered altered states of consciousness during BDSM activities.
1.7.4.2.5.1. Pro: Bottoms entered an altered state called “[transient hypofrontality](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201502/the-surprising-psychology-bdsm)”, which is associated with reductions in pain, feelings of floating, feelings of peacefulness, feelings of living in the here and now and time distortions.
1.7.4.2.5.2. Pro: [Tops](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-wide-wide-world-psychology/201502/the-surprising-psychology-bdsm) entered the altered state known as “flow”, which is associated with focused attention, a loss of self-consciousness and optimal performance of a task.
1.7.4.2.6. Con: An experience being transcendental or spiritual does not necessarily mean that it is not abusive.
1.7.4.3. Pro: The practice of BDSM is often rooted in [ritual](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-017-9461-7).
1.7.4.3.1. Pro: Many ancient cultures believed that ritual ordeal and/or sexual ecstasy could bring about transformation. Some of these have parallels to the bodily practices of consensual SM.
1.7.4.3.1.1. Pro: In leather bars, especially until the 1980s, each newcomer to the scene had to be an "apprentice" to a master, and complete their rites of passage before they would be accepted as a full and trustworthy member of the community.
1.7.4.3.1.2. Pro: Some practitioners carry out bonding rituals, which can include piercing each other's chests and dancing, connected by string. This is likely inspired by the [Sun Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Dance) ritual.
1.7.4.3.2. Pro: The most elementary form of religious life is the celebration of a groups "in-group-ness", so the BDSM scene arguably displays elements of a "religious life". \([Langdridge and Barker](https://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9780230517745), p. 106\).
1.7.4.3.3. Pro: Consensual BDSM sometimes includes elements of mysticism, specifically the idea of using one's body and its sensuous capacities as a medium.
1.7.4.3.3.1. Pro: Detaching oneself from the outside world in order to fully enter a scene is often seen as a prerequisite for a full experience, or at least a desirable state by practitioners.
1.7.4.3.3.2. Pro: Some BDSM practices tie back to medieval traditions of [flagellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellation#Christianity) and devotionalism. In order to reach detachment, a practitioner strives for unconditional obedience, interminable examination, and exhaustive confession.
1.7.4.3.3.3. Pro: The Indian tantric traditions utilize sexual practices in order to achieve greater detachment from the rules of morality.
1.7.4.3.4. Pro: Practitioners invent rituals, such as kneeling to greet their dominant, handing over personal items, putting on special clothing or a collar, to facilitate the switch between everyday or work life and their role as a [submissive](https://submissiveguide.com/personalgrowth/articles/regaining-submissive-mind-space-through-ritual).
1.7.4.3.4.1. Pro: [Collaring](http://dominantguide.com/56/ceremony-from-the-heart-the-collaring-ceremony/) ceremonies in particular are seen as meaningful, and sometimes denote the establishment of a committed relationship, or other important cornerstone in a couple's life.
1.7.4.4. Con: Radical feminists have argued that BDSM practices just replicate patriarchal power dynamics and perpetuate women's [oppression](https://www.salon.com/2012/07/09/questioning_female_submission_salpart/).
1.7.4.4.1. Con: Radical Feminism is a valid way to understand the society, but does not advocate for every woman or feminist group.
1.7.4.4.2. Con: There is no rule in BDSM that says that men have to be the dominating party. Many men are the submissive party in BDSM relationships.
1.7.4.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.7.4.1.3.1.2.
1.7.4.4.3. Con: In a [study](https://www.lelo.com/blog/six-myths-about-bdsm-debunked-by-science/), dominating someone sexually was a fantasy reported by 60% of men and 47% of women, while 65% of women and 53% of men fantasised about being sexually dominated.
1.7.4.4.3.1. Pro: This demonstrates that while more men are attracted to being the domineering personality and more women are attracted to being the submissive, the numbers are not gravely different. There are still a large number of women who are the dominant partner.
1.7.4.4.3.2. Pro: Traditional gender norms over the past decades have dictated roles in sexual relationships. It might be the case that taboo or conditioning might have prevented these people from wanting to explore other positions in sexual relationships. These are precisely the kind of boundaries that the BDSM community is trying to break.
1.7.4.4.4. Con: Many feminists [support](https://jezebel.com/5666107/bdsm-and-feminism-stop-telling-me-what-im-supposed-to-like-dmn-it) women choosing to engage in BDSM relationships.
1.7.4.4.4.1. Pro: As all of BDSM is based on consent, entering into a BDSM relationship by one's own consent is beneficial to equality.
1.7.4.5. Con: Sexuality in many cultures and religions is seen as something taboo. The celebration or liberation of sexuality beyond normative ways is completely unnecessary, and is often seen as something that's prohibited.
1.7.4.5.1. Pro: Most [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_and_sexuality) see sexuality as something incredibly limited and only for the purposes of reproduction. The moral codes surrounding these beliefs rarely allow kinks like BDSM to be a part.
1.7.4.5.1.1. Pro: The [Christian](http://www1.cbn.com/biblical-view-sexuality) view of sexuality sees the body as something sacred. Subjecting the body to the rituals of BDSM is a strict violation of that belief.
1.7.4.5.1.2. Con: The Bible does not restrict sexual activity between married adults to a large amount. It preaches against adultery and pornography and mentions mutual consent in 1 Corinthians 7:5. However it does not at any point talk against BDSM activities in the “marriage bed.”
1.7.4.5.1.2.1. Con: Sex is to be the literal/physical expression of a married couple being “one flesh” \(Genesis 2:24\). To include pain, humiliation and abuse \(even though it is simulated\) into the sexual relationship distorts this concept of oneness and love, even when such actions are consensual. Therefore making it go against the ideals of a Christian marriage bed.
1.7.4.5.1.3. Con: Ariella Perry [wrote](http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2015/3/12/the-50-shades-of-jews-practicing-bdsm) in the Times of Israel that Judaism “does not idealise the idea of one partner dominating or suppressing the other.” Yet “there is nothing in the world of soft-BDSM that is specifically contrary to halachah and Jewish law, and it can certainly be utilised to spice up one’s sexual relationship,”
1.7.4.5.2. Pro: In [India](https://feminisminindia.com/2015/06/04/taboos-female-sexuality/), sexuality has been considered as something to be discussed in hushed voices and discovered behind closed doors. There is little formal sex education and even less literature on alternative sexual preferences and as such, it becomes hard for topics such as BDSM to ever come up in conversation.
1.7.4.5.2.1. Pro: Women in India face multiple taboos that act as hurdles in their exploration of sexuality.
1.7.4.5.2.1.1. Pro: Some extremely conservative Indian societies see masturbation as a sign of polluting the human body and as such, women are expected to refrain from it.
1.7.4.5.2.1.2. Pro: There is a high value placed on virginity in Indian culture and women who have had sex before marriage are often considered "impure" or "immoral". This cultural mindset makes it hard for women to explore their sexual preferences.
1.7.4.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: Despite the Supreme Court of India's ruling against it on grounds of violating human dignity, [Two Finger Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginity_test#Two-finger_test) are conducted on rape victims and on brides to be to see if women are "used to" sexual intercourse.
1.7.4.5.2.1.3. Pro: Some regressive societies see female sexual pleasure as undesirable and conduct female circumcisions and other kinds of [female genital mutilation](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/), especially in young girls. This makes it harder for women to explore their sexuality later in life.
1.7.4.5.3. Con: The fact that some cultures and religions stigmatise sexuality already does not justify that stigma.
1.7.4.5.4. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.5.2.1.3.
1.7.5. Pro: -> See 1.6.6.
1.7.6. Pro: Many individuals enjoy recieving certain amounts of physical pain as it drives their sexuality beyond what can be done without pain.
1.8. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.5.
1.9. Con: When practiced properly, BDSM gives practitioners a number of benefits.
1.9.1. Con: BDSM has a large range of activities within it. While it can be beneficial, it can just as easily be the opposite. This is mostly [depending on the people](https://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/ultimate-guide-to-bdsm?utm_term=.btl1MPXNWQ#.wuyQN1GO0K) involved, as the acts themselves can easily be damaging.
1.9.1.1. Con: The BDSM community has a list of structured guidelines to ensure that the benefits outweigh the possible risks if followed properly.
1.9.2. Con: -> See 1.3.3.1.1.
1.9.3. Pro: [Research](http://time.com/4511726/bdsm-sex-flow-state-mindfulness/) supports the idea that BDSM enables participants to engage in mindfulness. Mindfulness is proven to have a large number of psychological benefits.
1.9.3.1. Pro: People in the BDSM community often talk about being transported into a state of flow, this state is seen by [psychologists](https://www.bustle.com/articles/186777-bdsm-may-be-the-most-mindful-type-of-sex-study-finds) as very similar to meditative states in mindfulness techniques.
1.9.4. Pro: -> See 1.6.8.4.4.
1.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.
1.9.6. Pro: [Research](http://www.medicaldaily.com/sm-may-be-new-yoga-bdsm-causes-blood-flow-brain-alter-state-consciousness-269863) has found giving or receiving pain can alter blood flow in the brain, and lead to a feeling of living in the here and now, while reducing anxiety.
1.9.7. Pro: -> See 1.1.3.
1.9.8. Pro: A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18563549) on hormonal changes and couple bonding in BDSM, determined that participating in successful sadomasochistic scenes increases the feeling of connectedness and intimacy with partners.
1.9.8.1. Pro: Connectivity and intimacy are [markers](https://www.oneplace.com/ministries/new-life-live/read/articles/6-marks-of-a-healthy-relationship-15854.html) of a non-abusive relationship.
1.9.8.1.1. Con: Not if the intimacy and connectivity are based on inherently abusive acts such as sadism and masochism.
1.9.8.2. Con: This claim ignores participants reporting their BDSM activities went poorly and sometimes led to a decrease in relationship closeness.
1.9.8.3. Con: The idea of two people being closer to each other through sadism and masochism is questionable. A relationship should not be based on such abuse.
1.9.8.3.1. Con: There is no single definition for what ought to constitute a good and healthy relationship. BDSM might bring some couples together and society ought to respect that.
1.10. Con: -> See 1.7.4.
1.11. Con: Not all forms of BDSM include pain and/or humiliation.
1.11.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.
1.11.2. Con: Pain and humiliation are not the only forms of abuse that exist.
1.11.2.1. Pro: Abuse includes maltreatment and improper and/or excessive misuse. Forcing someone's obedience, hence, is an abusive act.
1.11.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.1.
1.11.2.1.2. Con: By the logic that forcing someone's obedience is abuse, any job contract would fall under the guise of abuse. There is an inherent dominant/submissive relationship in the workplace and in BDSM.
1.11.2.1.2.1. Con: Inherent means foundational or essential. If job contracts have a foundation built on abuse then they are indeed inherently abusive. Slavery is more along the lines of forcing someone's obedience, therefore slavery is inherently abusive.
1.11.2.1.2.1.1. Pro: Bondage describes the sexual practice that involves the tying up or restraining of one partner. The word's original meaning is synonymous with slavery.
1.11.2.1.2.2. Pro: Employers do have a history of abusing workers.
1.11.2.1.2.2.1. Pro: During the industrial revolution, [child labor](https://www.history.com/topics/child-labor) was on a rise where employers were able to hire children to work long hours and pay them scraps.
1.11.2.1.2.2.2. Pro: The meat packing industry is well known [for turning abuse into a business model](http://www.motherjones.com/food/2011/06/spam-factory-conditions/#), even in the 21st century, with bad working conditions and [dismissals if workers exercise their rights.](https://www.hrw.org/report/2005/01/24/blood-sweat-and-fear/workers-rights-us-meat-and-poultry-plants)
1.11.2.1.2.3. Pro: By this logic, any profession where one has to abide by a code of conduct, such as the military, intelligence or government service are all abusive.
1.11.3. Pro: Since BDSM neither requires harsh or coarsely insulting language, nor physical or emotional injury, it is not inherently abusive.
1.11.4. Pro: BDSM is about far more than sex or sexual domination. It is far more a mental exercise for all parties involved. It helps to break mental moulds and barriers by forcing vulnerability and discomfort which can lead to profound self awakenings.
1.11.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.7.4.3.
1.11.4.2. Con: Forced vulnerability isn't always a good thing and can cause serious mental issues when incited by a non-professional.
1.11.5. Pro: Typically, what most people see of BDSM comes from pornography. And while an unending cascade of voices will rain down on you to ensure you know that it is a unrealistic view of sex in regards to the more vanilla stuff, few people make the connection that it doesn't represent any other branches of relationships either.
1.12. Con: BDSM relationships require a higher level of trust and communication than non-kinky relationships, which means that if participants begin to feel uncomfortable at any point then they are more likely to directly address these concerns with their partner\(s\). This helps to prevent abuse before it can occur.
1.12.1. Con: Many of the activities practiced in BDSM are considered abusive in other contexts, therefore it is unclear why supposedly higher trust and communication levels should negate that fact.
1.12.1.1. Con: While lack of trust, open communication, and consent is what makes the activities mentioned abusive, the practice of consensual BDSM fundamentally changes the lens through which we view these activities. In that context, they are not abusive.
1.12.2. Con: -> See 1.3.4.2.4.
1.12.3. Pro: -> See 1.3.4.2.
1.12.4. Pro: BDSM practitioners [respect](https://www.verywell.com/difference-between-bdsm-and-abuse-4065395) the boundaries of their partner\(s\) and are less likely to cross the boundaries of personal safety.
