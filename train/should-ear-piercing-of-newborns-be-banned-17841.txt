Discussion Title: Should ear piercing of newborns be banned?

1. Ear piercing of newborns should be banned.
1.1. Pro: It is an unnecessary procedure with a risk of infection and as such it should be avoided.
1.1.1. Con: Girls will not need to experience the pain of ear piecings when they grow up.
1.1.1.1. Con: They will experience pain as newborns instead. This could potentially cause psychological trauma.
1.1.1.1.1. Pro: There can be some mental health risks associated with the pain caused by the procedure.
1.1.1.2. Con: Girls do not 'need' to experience the pain of ear piercing - if they wish to, they can choose not to get their ears pierced when they grow up.
1.1.2. Pro: Babies and young children are not very dexterous, and could injure themselves by accidentally ripping the piercing.
1.1.2.1. Con: Studs are the most usual choice for ear piercing of very little children. With no dangling parts, the risk of the child grasping it and ripping it out is greatly reduced.
1.1.3. Con: When performed by a professional with appropriate equipment and sanitation, it is a safe procedure with minimal risks.
1.1.3.1. Con: Even if the risks are lower, they are still there and there is still no necessity for the procedure.
1.1.3.2. Pro: Completely eliminating risks is never possible. If risks are sufficiently mitigated by appropriately regulated practice, there is no need for a complete ban.
1.1.3.2.1. Pro: We don't ban driving even though [1.3 million people](http://asirt.org/Initiatives/Informing-Road-Users/Road-Safety-Facts/Road-Crash-Statistics) die in car accidents each year.
1.1.3.2.1.1. Con: There is a quantifiable benefit in car travel, for fast personal transportation. There is no quantifiable benefit in causing wounds to a child, only to insert decorative objects there.
1.1.4. Pro: According to [this wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_ear_piercing#Infections), there is a 10-30% risk of infections by Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, and furthermore, infected tissue can form abscess that needs to be surgically drained or it can lead to ear deformities.
1.1.5. Pro: Lower grade earrings containing nickel are fairly common in retail. These can cause irritation, slowing the healing process and further increasing the time window when the wound is vulnerable to infections.
1.2. Pro: The procedure causes pain to a newborn. Causing unnecessary pain to babies is plain wrong.
1.2.1. Con: The pain of the procedure is minimal and will be forgotten almost immediately by a newborn baby.
1.2.1.1. Con: The fact they don't remember it doesn't mean it hasn't caused some damage to their mental health already.
1.2.1.2. Pro: Children barely remember anything prior to age of three. They won't be able to remember this.
1.2.2. Con: Instruments to perform piercings are highly sophisticated and intervention is minimal.
1.2.2.1. Con: A piercing gun is usually used no matter if it's performed by a physician or a retail store worker. It is just a mechanism that uses high speed and blunt force, ripping the jewelry through.
1.2.3. Pro: -> See 1.1.1.1.1.
1.3. Pro: It violates body autonomy of an infant.
1.3.1. Con: Parents have the right to decide what is best for their child before they come of age.
1.3.1.1. Con: There are limitations to this right already, and the list is growing. Some more serious offenses like female genital mutilation can even get the parents jailed. Thus, there is no sacred right for parents to pierce a newborn's ears.
1.3.1.2. Con: Piercing the ears of an infant is not 'best' for the infant, as it provides no benefit whatsoever to the infant. It's is a purely aesthetic choice, and should therefore should be left up to the child.
1.3.1.2.1. Pro: It is morally wrong to poke holes in babies for the aesthetic enjoyment of adults.
1.3.1.2.1.1. Con: Beautiful aesthetics enhance the pleasure of the baby girl.
1.3.1.2.1.1.1. Con: There is no pleasure for the baby girl herself, only pain.
1.3.1.2.1.1.2. Con: The same exterior may be achieved with adhesive or magnetic earrings that do not require piercing.
1.3.1.2.1.1.2.1. Con: Magnetic earrings can be swallowed by small children.
1.3.1.2.1.2. Pro: Babies are not aesthetic objects for the enjoyment of their parents - they are people with the right to bodily integrity.
1.3.1.2.1.3. Pro: The primary aim of parenting is not the enjoyment of parents, but the well-being of the child.
1.3.1.2.1.4. Pro: Aesthetically, ear piercings are horrible on newborns.
1.3.1.2.1.4.1. Con: Aesthetic perception is mostly subjective. While some jewelry may be objectively better suited \(aesthetically\) for newborns, different people will respond differently to the result.
1.3.2. Con: The hole is tiny. Furthermore, a corrective surgery can remove the fistula and let it close entirely, leaving only a small scar.
1.3.2.1. Con: Being left with 'only' a permanent scar is not an acceptable choice to make on behalf of a defenceless baby.
1.3.3. Pro: The child can decide on its own as early as five or six years old. There is no need to decide in the child's stead.
1.3.3.1. Con: At a young age children are impulsive and incapable of making well-considered decisions about things with long-term consequences.
1.3.3.1.1. Con: This is a fairly safe ground for them to try and learn. If they regret their decision later, at least it teaches them something. Regretting their parents' decision doesn't have such effect.
1.3.3.1.1.1. Con: Lessons through which kids learn should rather avoid involving permanent bodily modification.
1.3.3.2. Pro: The child can also learn some responsibility that way. [This girl](https://youtu.be/rPl42c6oEbg) is one example of many.
1.3.3.2.1. Pro: There is some pain involved in piercing that the child must overcome to reach the desired result.
1.3.3.2.2. Pro: The child can learn that their friend's house or a retail store are not the best locations for piercing.
1.4. Con: Ear piercing of newborns is customary in some societies. Banning it would be discriminatory against them and their accepted cultural norms.
1.4.1. Pro: In [some parts of India](https://www.babycenter.in/a1021733/piercing-your-babys-ears), the baby's ears are pierced on the day of the barase or naamkaran, that is on the twelfth or thirteenth day after birth.
1.4.2. Con: There are other kinds of body modifications performed on children in other parts of the world and considered cultural norm. It didn't stop the ban of female genital mutilation.
1.5. Pro: -> See 1.3.1.2.1.
1.6. Con: There is no serious risk for the baby, that would justify a state intervention.
1.6.1. Con: -> See 1.1.4.
1.7. Con: It is a fairly widespread and popular practice and as such, not easy to uproot. The ban would lack popular support.
1.7.1. Pro: Enforcement would be also fairly hard, as the risks and impact don't justify considering it more than just a minor offense. Many people would rather pay a fine than change their habits.
1.7.1.1. Con: A fine will still reduce the popularity of the procedure and spread the awareness of its negative effects among the parents.
1.7.2. Con: A lack of popular support for the ban does not mean that it is not the right thing to do. Ethical choices are not determined by popularity.
