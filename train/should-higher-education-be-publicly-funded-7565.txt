Discussion Title: Should higher education be publicly funded?

1. Higher education should be publicly funded.
1.1. Con: Higher education funding benefits the already privileged.
1.1.1. Pro: Students who have had better-quality education throughout their lives prior to higher education are much more likely to achieve the academic success needed to access free higher education. This will thus only perpetuate a lack of social mobility within education.
1.1.1.1. Con: Though it is true, that students with better quality education do better, that doesn't mean public education should be free. In fact, the reason private schools often have a better quality of education compared to public is because there is investment of both the school and parents; thus trickling down to investment of the student.
1.2. Pro: The need for a college degree has increased to where a high school degree was needed in the 1970s.
1.2.1. Con: That's due to the educational lie that one must have a 4 year college degree to be successful.
1.2.1.1. Pro: There are many jobs that only need a 2 year degree, or a trade certificate.
1.2.1.2. Pro: There are many respectable jobs that don't require a college degree.
1.2.1.2.1. Pro: Some [respectable/necessary jobs](http://www.nwitimes.com/business/jobs-and-employment/high-paying-jobs-that-don-t-require-a-college-degree/collection_db42de6b-5746-5fd1-9b3d-2033f7249822.html#37) with livable year salaries that require no degrees are as follows: banker: 31-48K, garbage col. :34-45k, financial service sales: 100K.
1.3. Con: The government will always have a motive to indoctrinate people in certain ways, and if they fund higher education there will be no way to challenge them.
1.3.1. Con: A policy of public funding may be developed without in itself entailing any policies such as of censorship, development of political propaganda in any guise, or other socio-political policies such as might be observed of any typically autocratic, despotic, or more singularly fascist societies - as in the contemporary world and historically. A policy of public funding, inasmuch, may not per se entail any governmental or otherwise institutionalized control of educational content in itself.
1.4. Pro: Having a well-educated population is not just good for the economy, but also for democracy and civilisation in general.
1.4.1. Pro: A more educated population can make more informed decisions about matters related to public policy.
1.4.2. Pro: A well educated populace can generally engage with logical arguments better than a less-educated populace.
1.5. Pro: The cost of college education has increased 300% in the last 20 years.  The costs could be controlled by a single payer.
1.5.1. Con: Attempting to muscle universities and colleges into lowering costs could result in poorer quality institutions, fewer places, and less successful research.
1.5.2. Con: Fiscally conservative organisations such as the GOP would make it politically difficult to enact.
1.6. Pro: Publicly funded schooling would give equal access to education and makes for a more fair and equal society.
1.6.1. Con: Publicly funding higher education will not make a huge difference. Inequalities would have been entrenched in primary and secondary schooling by then.
1.7. Con: The cost of attending makes students more accountable to their work.  They work harder because they paid for it.
1.7.1. Con: If that were the only reason students work hard than it would follow that students wouldn't work hard in public school. That is not the case.
1.7.2. Con: Free Higher Education would mean that students would enter university on merit alone. This would mean that students would work harder because they know they cannot 'buy' their way into university.
1.7.3. Con: The cost of attending does not make students more accountable for their work. In many cases, students take out federally subsidized student loans and they don't feel the immediate impact of the cost of attending.
1.8. Con: Alternative mechanisms for free higher education already exist.
1.8.1. Pro: The military will pay for one's schooling if one signs up with a branch of service.
1.8.1.1. Con: Unfortunately, the military banks on the fact that most of the younger degree-less soldiers will die, injured or choose not to continue school; thus not having to pay for their continuing education.
1.8.1.1.1. Con: If that were true, they'd be making a terrible gamble, as one's chances of dying as an average US service member over 3 years \(the time required to qualify for full college tuition\) are about 0.3%.
1.8.1.1.1.1. Pro: Even, injury doesn't stop prospective students with increasingly disability-friendly campuses, and overall the post 9/11 [GI bill](https://phys.org/news/2017-08-veterans-enrolled-college-post-gi.html) has increased enrollment.
1.8.2. Con: These alternatives may not be as easily accessible as public universities.
1.9. Con: Tax payers should not have to pay for someone else to go to school.
1.9.1. Con: Having a more educated population benefits our society.
1.9.1.1. Con: This assumes there is unlimited amount of money to support all students. Given a finite amount of available money to spend, it is more beneficial to distribute it to fund the fields or students that need it the most.
1.9.2. Con: People already have to pay for many things that benefit people other than themselves; people pay different amounts of taxes depending on their income in many countries.
1.9.3. Con: Adding a 'school' tax will not make a huge difference to more privileged people's wallets, but would have a significant impact on lower-income families who would not otherwise have been able to afford to send their child to university.
1.9.4. Pro: Students do not need the government's funding \(aka loans and grants\) because they can learn for free \(with [open courseware](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=jRJPWp2cIcb4mAGsyoKgAQ&q=opencourseware&oq=open+cours&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0i10k1j0l9.480.2459.0.3362.11.10.0.0.0.0.257.1106.0j5j2.7.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..4.7.1106.0..0i131k1j0i3k1.0.FGxe4e7KY2g)\) and get college credits for low costs through massively open online courses \([MOOC's](https://www.google.com/search?ei=kRJPWrOFK8eOmQG-haDoCA&q=mooc&oq=mooc&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67k1j0i131k1j0l5j0i10k1j0l2.30564.30929.0.31187.4.4.0.0.0.0.125.237.0j2.2.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..2.2.236....0.SSQpbz2Qhqo)\).
1.9.4.1. Con: The courses that are offered through open online courses that are free and will earn college credits are very limited. Through mooc.org, at this time, there are only 5 \(very introductory\) classes in the sciences and 4 in the humanities.
1.9.4.1.1. Pro: However, students only pay when they pass the class. The savings from this are substantial.
1.9.4.2. Pro: There are many scholarships that are available. Furthermore, many of those scholarships are privately funded through private foundations. [scholarships.com](https://www.scholarships.com/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-directory/race)
Also, when the government gets involved it becomes bureaucratic, slow and has the potential to be come biased.
1.9.4.3. Con: allowing the government too much control over the funding of education would also grant them suspicious power over what is 'education'.
1.9.5. Pro: Instead of the purely free method given in the thesis, there are other options in the middle ground that both provide access to further education for all who meet the academic criteria, while ensuring that the taxpayer is not unfairly burdened. See [this article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-26957757) for the UK approach.
1.9.6. Con: In many states, [taxpayers already contribute](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/californians-pay-states-public-colleges-increasingly-cant-get) to public universities. Thus, public state universities are publicly funded - percentages of operating budget vary from state to state. Full tuition for two year community/technical college already exists in [Tennessee](http://tnpromise.gov/about.shtml) .
1.10. Pro: Students would be able to find their passions as opposed to studying what will give them the fattest paycheck.
1.10.1. Con: Having free higher education does not mean that this would necessarily be the case. Many people leave state-funded \(free\) high school/secondary education having studied certain subjects due to primarily financial goals, regardless of the fact that their education has not left them in debt.
1.10.2. Con: If this is true, then it would cause further damage to public finances, as graduates would earn less, pay less tax, and generally be less of an asset to the economy.
1.10.2.1. Con: This rests on the assumption that students cannot be productive members of society whilst pursuing their passions.
1.10.2.2. Con: Even if those graduates earn less and are less of an asset to the economy, this can open up the opportunity for someone more passionate about a higher paying field, who will be a bigger asset to the economy.
1.11. Con: This costs too much money and will harm the economy. The developed world and the developing world alike cannot afford this.
1.11.1. Con: Without the burden of student debt, graduates will spend more money improving the economy.
1.11.1.1. Con: This immediately assumes that money is better off for the economy in the hands of graduates than it is in the hands of the government.
1.11.1.2. Pro: A large chunk of graduates with student debt [delay starting their own businesses.](http://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/186179/student-loan-debt-major-barrier-entrepreneurship.aspx)
