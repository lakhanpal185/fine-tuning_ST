Discussion Title: Should Gay Men Be Allowed To Donate Blood?

1. Gay men should be allowed to donate blood.
1.1. Pro: [Many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men_blood_donor_controversy#List_of_countries_with_their_stand_on_MSM_blood_donors) allow gay men to donate with no deferral which proves it is safe.
1.1.1. Pro: Since the UK has dropped its wait time to 3 months, other nations should consider following suit. There can't be much difference in the scientific facts.
1.1.2. Con: One country's decision should not influence other global procedures.
1.1.2.1. Con: Any decision embarked on by a country would likely have been considered in light of evidence. As such, if no evidence was found by those countries of the harm of a policy, it can be fairly confidently asserted that any other country would get similar findings.
1.1.3. Con: [Many countries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11848729) have high rates of HIV contamination from blood products
1.2. Pro: All blood is tested for pathogens and viruses without regard to donor background.

"Each unit of blood donated in the U.S. is routinely screened for various infectious disease pathogens, including five transfusion–transmitted viruses, using nine laboratory tests." - [The Center for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/bloodsafety/basics.html) -

"At the time of each donation, blood samples are collected for testing." - [Canadian Blood Services](https://blood.ca/en/hospitals/donation-testing)
1.2.1. Con: HIV+ blood is not screened for, as per the provided source.
1.3. Pro: Limiting any healthy individual from donating is discriminatory.
1.3.1. Pro: The AIDS scare has made it common practice to associate AIDS and HIV with homosexuals. All right, it may be more common, but that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men. People wanting to donate blood obviously have an understanding of the need for ‘clean’ blood. They would be the people most likely to possess this.
1.3.2. Pro: A ban for gay men merely propagates homophobic stereotypes.
1.3.3. Con: Giving blood is not a right, only patient benefit should be considered.
1.3.3.1. Con: 'Human Rights' refer to an action in which there is always a concomitant duty, from others as well as the rights holder, associated with the human right. In many cases the duty on other people is simply that they do not interfere or prevent the exercise of the right" Additionally, a moral claim does supersede a legal right when there is a correlative civil liberty.
1.3.4. Pro: Other groups \(such as gay women\) have not been banned from donating.
1.3.4.1. Con: The fact that gay women are not banned shows that it is not a question of discrimination but a question of minimizing risks depending on sexual practices.
1.3.4.2. Con: Women are not a high risk group for HIV. They are only banned from donating in certain jurisdictions if they have had sex with someone from a high risk group.
1.3.5. Con: Discrimination is warranted where it preserves patient safety.
1.4. Pro: Questionnaires and history of sexual contact should identify a donor as safe or unsafe.
1.4.1. Con: It is easy to lie on forms to avoid humiliation.
1.4.1.1. Pro: Confidential Exclusion forms and Confidential Donation Confirmation have shown to have negligible impact on deterrence and safety.

1.4.1.2. Con: There is little to no reason for them to do so; if they wish to donate blood, evidently they have a degree of care about others. Lying would contradict the very reasons they might want to donate.
1.4.2. Con: People may forget about or neglect to mention important information; it is too much of a risk.
1.4.3. Pro: The questionnaire stage is where the patient would be asked about their sexuality. If this is considered pertinent information and the patient is taken at their word, then equally the patient can be trusted to give relevant information regarding their sexual history, making sexuality irrelevant
1.4.4. Con: Erring on the side of caution is necessary given the immensely detrimental effects of mis-screening of blood products.
1.5. Con: Allowing high-risk groups to donate compromises patient safety.
1.5.1. Con: It may be possible to disallow donations from those who had unprotected sex or a high number of partners, instead of making sexual orientation the basis.
1.5.1.1. Con: Gay men are [much more likely](http://factsaboutyouth.com/posts/promiscuity/) to have unprotected anal sex, with multiple partners.
1.5.1.1.1. Con: Women are much more likely to have unprotected sex than homosexual and heterosexual men combined. [¹](https://ifstudies.org/blog/promiscuous-america-smart-secular-and-somewhat-less-happy)
1.5.1.1.1.1. Con: These figures are unrelated, as the parent claim is specifically about anal sex.
1.5.1.1.1.1.1. Con: The parent claim is "Allowing high risk groups to donate compromises patient safety." Sub-claims do specify 'anal sex;' however, women also engage in unprotected 'anal sex.' Additionally, approximately 2% of Heterosexual men have admittedly had a same sex partner, and 39% of Homosexual men have had sex with a partner of the opposite sex; [¹](https://contexts.org/blog/sexual-orientation-versus-behavior-different-for-men-and-women/) therefore, it cannot be ignored that women are correlatively high risk.
1.5.1.1.1.1.2. Con: This can be true also for anal sex between men and women.
1.5.1.1.2. Con: The source of your data is not reliable, as the authors of the webpage promote "reorientation therapies" whose effects hasn't been scientifically proven, and they are likely to profit from misinformation and bad stereotypes about homosexuality.
1.5.2. Con: While [anal sex](http://www.aidsmap.com/HIV-transmission-risk-during-anal-sex-18-times-higher-than-during-vaginal-sex/page/1446187/) may be a more high risk practice than vaginal \(due to the lack of mucus\) that is not a reason to ban gay men, since other groups can also engage in anal sex.
1.5.2.1. Con: Gay people  \(men specifically\) are dramatically overrepresented in HIV carriers in the United States.

[www.hiv.gov](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics)
1.5.2.1.1. Con: Age, Race, and Gender are categories that take precedence over Homosexuality.

This is since these categories include both homosexual & heterosexual individuals; and are therefore higher risk categories than Homosexuality alone.. [¹](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/reports/surveillance/cdc-hiv-surveillance-report-2016-vol-28.pdf) [²](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2016surveillance/pdfs/2016HepSurveillanceRpt.pdf)  \(Syntax and Diction changed per request.\) [³](https://www.kialo.com/should-gay-men-be-allowed-to-donate-blood-16326/16326.0=16326.1-16326.5-16326.13-16326.14-16326.17/-16326.17/comments)
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: The first link says the opposite.
Table [1a \(Page 16\)](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/reports/surveillance/cdc-hiv-surveillance-report-2016-vol-28.pdf) shows male-to-male sexual contact as the highest contributor \(67% in 2016\).  Age has a normal distribution, with no age group especially affected.
1.5.2.1.1.2. Con: The second link is about HAV, HBV, and HCV \(Types of Viral Hepatitis\) not HIV.
1.5.2.1.1.3. Pro: Gender shows 81% of those infected are male \(excluding children\).
1.5.2.1.1.3.1. Con: Gender is too broad a category to compare to "Male-to-male sexual contact".
1.5.2.1.1.3.2. Con: If we remove the "Male-to-male sexual contact" numbers from the Gender statistics, we show that the male/female split is 42%/58%, which is less significant than the 67% split for "Male-to-male sexual contact".
1.5.2.2. Con: -> See 1.5.1.1.
1.5.2.3. Pro: [Research suggests](https://kinseyconfidential.org/common-anal-sex-heterosexual-couples/) that about 10% of heterosexual women/men have had anal sex in the past year, with 25% having tried it at least once.
1.5.3. Pro: It takes 2-4 weeks for HIV to present any symptom. The incubation period risk is higher for a member of high risk group, even though members of a low risk group are not completely safe. The decision is based on the overall risk, not on an individual level.
1.5.3.1. Pro: This window period [can be as long as three to six months](http://www.sfaf.org/hiv-info/testing/#window), with an average of 22 days.
1.5.3.2. Con: A Deferral window \(set at [1 year in most countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men_blood_donor_controversy#List_of_countries_with_their_stand_on_MSM_blood_donors)\) makes it safe for men who have sex with men to donate blood.
1.5.3.2.1. Con: Men may lie about when they last had anal sex.
1.5.3.2.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.1.2.
1.5.3.2.2. Con: -> See 1.1.2.
1.5.4. Con: Grading blood packs based on their risk allows the optional use of high-risk blood in case of a shortage.
1.5.5. Con: Potentially dying of a disease is a better option than surely dying of anemia, so high-risk blood still has value in life-or-death situations.
1.5.5.1. Con: That would make sense only if the society is in a crisis of blood donation shortage. Managing blood at different risk level seems too complicated for normal operation.
1.5.5.1.1. Con: We are in a blood shortage crisis. [redcrossblood.org](https://www.redcrossblood.org/local-homepage/news/article/emergency-blood-shortage--red-cross-issues-urgent-call-for-blood.html)
1.5.6. Pro: The rate of new HIV infections is 44 times higher for men having sex with men than for the general population \([www.cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/factsheets/cdc-msm-508.pdf)\), while they comprise about 6.8% of the population \([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2791823/)\) There is a period of 2 weeks after infection during which the virus is undetectable in blood tests, causing an infection risk to patients. Allowing MSM to give blood would increase patient infection risk by .068*44+\(1-.068\) = 3.9 times, for only 7% more blood. The risk for patients is disproportionate.
1.5.7. Con: Out of people receiving HIV care in the UK, 48% were exposed through sex between a man and a woman, and 47% were exposed through sex between men. Heterosexual HIV transmissions outweigh those between men, and yet heterosexual people are not banned from donating blood. [HIV IN THE UK STATISTICS](https://www.nat.org.uk/we-inform/HIV-statistics/UK-statistics)
1.5.8. Con: The real high-risk group is anyone who has frequent \(unprotected\) sex with different partners; being gay does not make you a part of this.
1.6. Con: Testing blood from high-risk groups would be very expensive. Why do that if you can just accept from low-risk groups.
1.6.1. Con: If we're to use that logic than no individuals age 20 to 29 should be allowed to donate, as that is the largest risk group for HIV, Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis C according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/default.html).
1.6.1.1. Con: The '20 - 29' age group comprises a large percentage of all healthy people, while homosexuals generally only represent 1-4% of the total population.
1.6.1.1.1. Con: The total estimated population of individuals in the U.S. between 20-29 is 45,270,000. [¹](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241488/population-of-the-us-by-sex-and-age/) The total estimated population of Homosexuals in the U.S. \(4.1% of 325,700,000\) is 13,353,700. [²](https://www.statista.com/statistics/719674/american-adults-who-identify-as-homosexual-bisexual-or-transgender/) Approximately 36.5% of all new HIV related cases fall within the 20-29 age group, and Homosexuals make up 66.69% of all new HIV related cases. [³](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/reports/surveillance/cdc-hiv-surveillance-report-2016-vol-28.pdf) Comparatively, the risk factor for the Age Demographic still outweighs Homosexuality by 59.91% with only a 29.49% difference in the two Demographics overall Population.
1.6.1.1.1.1. Con: 1\) Gay men is about half of all homosexual. You need to subtract lesbian from the 13,353,700 since they are not banned to donate. 2\) 35.5% of 40K \(annual new infect\) is 14,200 HIV new infect in age group 20 -29, that is 0.0314% of all 20 -29 age group. 66.69% of 40K is 26,676 new infect in all gay men, which is 0.1998% of all homosexuals. This is a risk factor more than 6 times higher, even counting the lesbians. For gay men, the risk factor is more than 12 times higher than the age group 20-29.
1.6.1.2. Con: The same CDC reporting \([Table 1a pg 16](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/reports/surveillance/cdc-hiv-surveillance-report-2016-vol-28.pdf)\) shows that the 20-29 age group only makes up 37.05% of instances, which is much less significant than the "Male-to-male sexual contact" rate of 66.79%. \(2016 data\)
1.6.2. Con: -> See 1.4.
1.6.3. Con: Limiting donors to such an extent would limit the amount of available blood and potentially lead to shortages.
1.6.3.1. Pro: Blood is always needed. If there is no risk to health, it is simply illogical to bar donations to a commodity in short supply.
1.6.3.1.1. Con: The entire issue is disputed safety; it is far more dangerous to have infected blood than to be in short supply.
1.6.3.1.2. Pro: Being gay doesn't really affect donating blood. It's not like being gay is in your blood. Gay people are the same as regular people and if they really wanted to donate, then they should because it can help society. Gay people shouldn't be left out from anything.
1.6.3.1.3. Con: There is a large risk to patient safety by allowing high-risk blood product donations.
1.6.4. Con: The potential for malice in humans is reason enough to test everyone's blood, regardless of the person's risk group.
1.6.5. Con: We already test blood from all groups. The added expense would be the same as increased participation of low risk groups.
1.7. Pro: -> See 1.6.3.1.
1.8. Pro: Stem cell donations are allowed by MSMs, so should blood.
1.8.1. Con: The product of stem cell extraction is used in isolation, and not provided to other patients, thus removing the risk of patient infection.
1.8.2. Con: Stem cell donation does not pose a risk of AIDs transmission to the recipient.
