Discussion Title: Is it okay to physically torture prisoners?

1. Physical torture of prisoners is an acceptable interrogation tool.
1.1. Pro: In addition to torture being an interrogation tool, the beneficial insights into human physiology and psychology revealed in the process of torture help justify its application.
1.1.1. Con: [The Hippocratic Oath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) is the oldest oath in Western medicine, and explicitly instructs physicians to do no harm in their practices.
1.1.1.1. Con: Those administering torture are unlikely to be trained as medical professionals, so they are unlikely to have taken the Hippocratic Oath.
1.1.1.1.1. Con: Insights into human physiology are unlikely to be gleaned by those without medical training.
1.1.1.1.2. Con: The Hippocratic Oath is a principle regarding the respectful treatment of human beings in medical treatment and learning about human physiology. Its existence suggests a principled illegitimacy in using torture to achieve medical insight.
1.1.1.1.2.1. Con: Principled illegitimacy does not invalidate factual knowledge.
1.1.1.1.3. Con: This is a circular argument. As they are not medical professionals, they are inherently unable to provide beneficial insights.
1.1.1.2. Pro: Medical professionals are [sometimes](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/12/do-no-harm-when-doctors-torture/383677/) involved in shaping torture programs.
1.1.2. Con: The [Declaration of Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Geneva) \(Physician's Pledge\) stands in direct opposition to medical practices that do not respect human life or violate the autonomy of a patient.
1.1.3. Pro: [Nazi human experimentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation) contributed to our medical understanding of transplantation, blood coagulation, hypothermia, and immunisation amongst other things.
1.1.3.1. Pro: The Dachau hypothermia experiments [have been cited](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3561733) by many reputable medical research papers \(at least 45 papers by 1984\).
1.1.3.1.1. Con: The citations are mostly indirect, referencing secondary sources, and are based on a [flawed understanding](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199005173222006) of the actual content of the Alexander report due to its limited availability. If the authors had seen the primary data, they would have dismissed it as unscientific.
1.1.3.2. Con: If experimenting by torture on innocent people is the way to gain medical progress and improve as a species we deserve to get extinct.
1.1.3.3. Con: The fact that Nazi inhumane experimentation correlated with new scientific discoveries does not imply that these discoveries could not have been made in ethical conditions.
1.1.3.4. Con: Because of its utter lack of scientific rigor, Nazi research is not considered to be [valid science](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4fwnn4/did_the_nazis_make_any_contributions_to_the/).
1.1.3.4.1. Pro: Even more so than its brutality, the inherent ideological bias, flawed experimental designs and lack of scientific rigour surrounding most of the "experiments" completely invalidate any conclusions and even make the collected data itself unusable.
1.1.3.4.1.1. Pro: The data collected was [unrepresentative](http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&context=uhp_theses) due to the specific groups used for experimentation and the ill-health of those forced to partake in the experiments.
1.1.3.4.2. Pro: The barbaric nature of Nazi experimentation led to the establishment of a set of research ethics principles known as the [Nuremberg Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code).
1.1.3.4.3. Con: The brutality of acquisition does not negate the positive developments; if it did, then no information gleaned through animal testing would be considered valid research.
1.1.3.4.3.1. Con: Human lives are [generally considered](https://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/why-are-humans-more-important-than-animals/18216) to be more valuable than those of animals, making the comparison between the two unevenly weighted.
1.1.4. Pro: [Unit 731](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731) was a WW2 Japanese army department that conducted vivisections and tested biological and chemical warfare agents on human prisoner subjects. Such experimentation lead to advances in surgical practice and our understanding of the action of many toxic compounds.
1.1.4.1. Con: The process of learning and experimentation can be done on model organisms, without torturing people.
1.1.5. Pro: [Project MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra) was a CIA-led project with participants including many research organisations, pharmaceutical companies and universities in the US. It focused on manipulating the mental state of prisoners under torture, leading to many scientific insights about the action of mind-altering drugs, hypnosis, sensory deprivation and psychological torture.
1.1.6. Con: There are other methods of gaining insight into human physiology. Torture is not necessary for this and torture has so many negative effects it's not an ethical justification for its use.
1.1.7. Con: Research is required to go through a board of ethics. Causing someone severe pain and suffering for research is not ethical. As well as doing no harm to people, ethical research also requires consent.
1.1.8. Con: Using scientific advancements as a justification for torture means that rather than performing it solely on prisoners, civilians could more easily be used as torture subjects as well.
1.1.9. Con: In these instances, torture is more of a side-effect than a primary aim; whilst the treatment is torturous in nature, it is in pursuit not of information nor behaviour, but rather, as an academic exercise or as an unethical medical practice. Thus, it is slightly outside the remit of this debate.
1.1.9.1. Pro: Although it's okay to learn from even the most unethical behavior, it should never be intentional to conduct unethical experiments with the purpose to learn.
1.2. Pro: Some methods that may be considered torture are not so damaging as to be illegitimate.
1.2.1. Con: Several experiments studying the '[empathy gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy_gap)' in relation to [torture](https://aeon.co/essays/an-ordinary-person-becomes-a-torturer-with-surprising-ease) have found that proponents of coercive interrogation don’t generally have personal experience of torture, and that, when talking about torture, there is a profound and deliberate confusion of what the person who is imposing the torture feels with what the person being tortured actually feels.
1.2.1.1. Pro: A person cannot understand how they are likely to feel after they have tortured another being until they have done so. It makes sense to protect people from this harm if they are not in a position to protect themselves.
1.2.2. Con: Some torture methods have little to no physical consequence but result in mental illnesses.
1.2.2.1. Pro: Aside from the type of torture itself, other factors like timing, behaviour of the torturers and especially the feeling of [helplessness](http://www.afterpsychotherapy.com/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/) can cause severe immediate distress and lasting trauma. This can be the case even if the method of torture used is considered mild.
1.2.2.2. Pro: There have been conclusive links drawn between the use of torture and [damaging psychological effects](https://worldwithouttorture.org/2015/03/18/six-ways-that-torture-affects-a-person-psychologically/) in the aftermath.
1.2.3. Con: Torture by [definition](https://www.apt.ch/en/what-is-torture/) is the act of inflicting severe physical or mental pain and thus is damaging.
1.2.3.1. Con: Article 1 of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment is the internationally agreed legal definition of torture, and expressly ["does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions."](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1505073/How-the-law-and-UN-define-torture.html)
1.2.3.2. Pro: Torture is only effective at getting people to give up information if it is damaging enough to the person being tortured that they become willing to give up important information. Therefore, it will always present significant damage to the person being tortured.
1.2.3.3. Con: Damage exists on a spectrum. Just because torture causes damage does not mean that it causes enough damage to be discounted as an interrogation method.
1.2.4. Pro: Many people would consider it torture to be imprisoned at all. Society as a whole considers this perfectly acceptable depending on the crime.
1.2.4.1. Con: -> See 1.2.3.1.
1.2.5. Con: Incarceration itself is torture. The deprivation of everyday liberties and freedoms is hell enough without considering living conditions, noise, food, danger from other inmates, etc.
1.2.5.1. Pro: Prisoners [have testified](https://www.afsc.org/document/torture-us-prisons) about their experiences in prison being similar if not identical to more commonly understood visions of torture.
1.3. Con: The act of torturing a human being has significant negative psychological impact on the torturer.
1.3.1. Pro: Torture \(physical or mental\) can never be morally acceptable because it's built on two cardinal sins - wrath and sloth. It stains and degrades the soul of the torturer, forever wrecks the lives of the tortured and their loved ones, and opens a gate of hell better left closed. Information needed? Find another way.
1.3.1.1. Con: If the people involved do not believe in God, then this argument is null and void.
1.3.1.1.1. Con: God's existence, and thus judgement, is unrelated to whether a person believes in God's existence.
1.3.1.1.2. Con: Moral degradation of the soul would presumably happen regardless of a person's beliefs.
1.3.2. Con: Giving people with violent tendencies an outlet through the profession of torturer would mean those people are less likely to inflict their tendencies on the general public.
1.3.3. Pro: Interrogators often suffer from [PTSD and vicarious trauma](https://www.law.utah.edu/effect-of-torture-on-the-torturer/) due to their line of work.
1.3.3.1. Pro: A former interrogator detailed in his memoir experiencing [insomnia, substance abuse and depression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-trauma/201608/cia-torture-techniques-harm-interrogators-well) after his service in Abu Ghraib.
1.3.4. Con: Serving as a soldier increases one's risk of suffering PTSD. Yet, there are circumstances that require people to serve as soldiers. Likewise, there may be circumstances that require people to serve as torturers.
1.3.4.1. Con: This analogy equals a soldier whose job is to protect the society from harm to a torturer whose job is to extract information through harm. It is an invalid analogy.
1.3.5. Con: In modern societies no one is forced to become a torturer - it is a job or position that is easy for people to avoid.
1.3.5.1. Con: The studies of [Milgram](https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html) and [Zimbardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment) challenge our naive views of human morality - they illustrate that individuals might have their own moral compass, but they are capable of overriding it and inflicting severe punishments on others when an authority figure is present and institutional circumstances demand it.
1.3.5.1.1. Pro: Milgram's experiment has been successfully [replicated](https://aeon.co/essays/an-ordinary-person-becomes-a-torturer-with-surprising-ease) numerous times since.
1.3.5.1.1.1. Pro: In 2010 Michaël Dambrun and Elise Vatiné at Blaise Pascal University in France replicated the [experiment](https://aeon.co/essays/an-ordinary-person-becomes-a-torturer-with-surprising-ease), but participants were told that the learner was an actor feigning being shocked. Yet several results stand out: participants reported less anxiety and distress when the learner was of North African origin. And participants who exhibited higher levels of right-wing authoritarianism and who showed higher levels of anger were more likely to show high levels of obedience as well.
1.3.5.1.1.2. Pro: A [replication](https://aeon.co/essays/an-ordinary-person-becomes-a-torturer-with-surprising-ease) of Milgram’s work was undertaken in 2014 by Laurent Bègue at the University of Grenoble and colleagues, who transposed the Milgram paradigm to a television game-show setting. Among other things, they found that individuals of a more rebellious disposition tended to administer lower-intensity shocks. It is worth noting that rebels are not usually selected by state institutions to operate sensitive programmes that concern national security.
1.3.5.1.2. Con: The Stanford Prison "experiment" is not meaningful. The experimenter participated in the experiment, the boys had an expectation of how the prison guards should act, and the experiment itself was cancelled midway through. The Stanford Prison "Experiment" is not a [valid indication of anything.](https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/the-real-lesson-of-the-stanford-prison-experiment)
1.3.5.1.2.1. Con: The experiment was suspended due to the harm to all participants and the ethical impossibility of continuing the experiment under such circumstances. Regardless of some methodological queries, it remains a [vital turning point](https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html) in aspects like ethical imprisonment and stereotyped roles in such circumstances.
1.3.5.1.2.2. Pro: The experiment is widely [discredited and criticised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment#Criticism) due to its lack of objectivity and methodological failings.
1.3.5.1.2.3. Pro: Moreover, there was a [recent publication](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/13/17449118/stanford-prison-experiment-fraud-psychology-replication), indicating that experiment itself was a little deceitful, it not outright fraud. There was also BBC Prison Study that lead to conclusions that differ from the original paper.
1.3.5.2. Con: -> See 1.2.1.1.
1.3.5.3. Con: If a torturer job position is something to avoid than torture is also something to avoid.
1.3.6. Pro: When [torture](https://aeon.co/essays/an-ordinary-person-becomes-a-torturer-with-surprising-ease) happens in a democracy, there is no secret society of fellow torturers from whom to draw succour, social support, and reward. Engaging in physical and emotional assaults upon the defenceless to elicit dubious intelligence is a degrading, humiliating, and damaging experience.
1.3.7. Con: The risk can be mitigated with training, reflection, and being aware of the purpose of the methods. A robust system which removes people that step over the line, or enjoy it, or are repulsed by it, can select people that can gain a sense of purpose by gaining intelligence from the subject.
1.4. Pro: Torture can help force prisoners to reveal information that could prevent attacks and save lives.
1.4.1. Con: Allowing torture in extreme cases, such as to prevent imminent attacks or where a hostage may be involved, creates specialists in the subject, institutions with professional interests, and relativistic legal justifications which will then encourage the legalization and use of torture in less extreme situations.
1.4.2. Con: There are other ways to reveal information and save lives without resorting to physical violence.
1.4.2.1. Pro: According to [interrogators](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/slightly-blighty/201701/does-torture-work), rapport-based techniques are much more effective than torture.
1.4.2.1.1. Pro: [Hanns-Joachim Gottlob Scharff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Scharff) - a Luftwaffe interrogator during WWII - proved that torture was not necessary, and he was known as the best in his field. He used kindness to obtain secrets from prisoners.
1.4.2.1.2. Con: Dangerous information can also be extremely time-sensitive; the information could be gleaned from other sources, such as rapport-based methods, certainly, but potentially too late to make a difference.
1.4.2.1.2.1. Con: Severe physical punishment can psychologically harm the prisoner by [potentially](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-physical-punishment/physical-punishment-tied-to-aggression-hyperactivity-idUSBREA0G16C20140117) making him more aggressive and dangerous.
1.4.2.1.2.2. Con: Receiving inaccurate information is no better than not getting any information in the first place. The argument that torture is acceptable when information is needed quickly fails to take into account the fact that the information received by torture is overwhelmingly incorrect in the first place.
1.4.2.1.2.3. Con: The legal torture is not a time-sensitive technique. Torture implies "[prolonged](http://www.nybooks.com/media/doc/2010/04/22/icrc-report.pdf)" periods as defined in US "enhanced interrogation techniques". The same goes for methods that were used in [USSR arsenal](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/weekinreview/03shane.html). Breaking the personality takes time, and it is necessary as short-term severe harm produces much less reliable results. It is not done within a few hours as it would be necessary in "exceptional situations". Time-sensitivity in relation to torture is a fallacy.
1.4.2.1.3. Pro: If torture is strictly prohibited, it is more likely that interrogators and government agencies will learn and hone rapport based techniques as they no longer have the easy option of torture.
1.4.2.1.3.1. Con: This assumes that torture is taken lightly by states who utilise it; a somewhat unreasonable assumption.
1.4.2.1.3.1.1. Pro: Given that torture is condemned by the [international community](http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/catcidtp/catcidtp.html), it is unlikely any state takes the use of torture lightly or as an easy option.
1.4.2.1.3.2. Con: If torture is strictly prohibited, it is more likely that interrogators and government agencies will simply continue to use it, albeit in a more covert manner.
1.4.2.1.3.2.1. Pro: Bans/prohibitions [rarely work](http://theantimedia.com/why-banning-things-almost-never-works/) as intended since they do nothing to change the underlying culture. Even if something is prohibited, that won't stop people from wanting to use it; therefore, they will often seek other methods through which to access what they want.
1.4.2.2. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.
1.4.3. Pro: Unpalatable though it is to contemplate, there are [extreme circumstances](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/in-defense-of-torture_b_8993.html) that warrant more intensive interrogative techniques.
1.4.3.1. Con: Extreme circumstances can be handled through executive pardons and jury nullification. They are not frequent enough to be made official policy.
1.4.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.
1.4.3.1.2. Con: Some prisoners might be too dangerous to release, so pardoning/giving a jury nullification would not be an option.
1.4.3.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.
1.4.3.3. Con: "In 1987 Israel legalised torture as an interrogation method under a “ticking bomb” scenario where torture was considered the only way to gain important information." "Between 1987 and 1994, the Israeli General Security Service officially interrogated 23,000 Palestinians, torturing the great majority, yet terrorism flourished” [www.e-ir.info](http://www.e-ir.info/2012/07/05/the-ticking-bomb-and-the-justification-of-torture/)
1.4.3.4. Pro: When talking about torturing known terrorists to get information that could potentially save lives, then yes it's okay. It's not ideal by any measure, and it's not moral under most circumstances. But if waterboarding a known terrorist for 12 hours gets vital information to save innocent civilians it's immoral to not do it.
1.4.3.5. Pro: The notorious '[ticking time-bomb scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticking_time_bomb_scenario)', which has been used for decades as a thought experiment in the debate about if/when torture is justifiable, is widely believed to be a situation in which more intensive interrogation techniques would be necessary if it meant preventing large scale loss of life.
1.4.3.5.1. Con: The extreme scenario has a set of inbuilt assumptions. It assumes that the attack is known to exist, that it is imminent, that the attack will kill a large number of people, that the person in custody is a perpetrator, that he/she has the info, that there are no other ways to get info, that there are no other actions to take instead. Finally, it assumes that torture will produce the results fast enough to prevent the event. Too many "what if's" for an intentional physical harm of a human being.
1.4.4. Pro: 57% of Americans [believe](http://time.com/3633497/american-torture-poll/) that torture tactics provide reliable information that helps prevent terrorist attacks at least some of the time.
1.4.4.1. Pro: [Around half](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/12/11/people-in-Britain-divided-over-use-of-torture/) of British respondents also agreed with the use of torture; more importantly, the majority agreed \(even if they would not support torture per se\) that using information gleaned from torture was valid.
1.4.4.2. Con: [Such surveys](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/mar/30/most-americans-support-torture-poll-brussels-attacks-terrorism) need to be considered in the light of their timing, their wording, and their nuance; the definition of torture, the political climate, and other circumstantial evidence are likely to seriously affect the outcome.
1.4.4.3. Con: Uneducated opinions are irrelevant and shouldn't be held in higher regard than information found from research.
1.4.4.3.1. Pro: We should not decide policies regarding use of force against potential enemy combatants based on public opinion. People can be easily swayed to supporting horrible atrocities during wartime \(such as execution of POWs, ethnic cleansing, and genocide\) by state propaganda. As such, the popular opinion should not be the metric by which we decide how we treat prisoners and whether the state tortures them or not.
1.4.4.4. Con: Beliefs are not indicative of factual accuracy.
1.4.4.5. Con: The vast majority of Americans have never been tortured.
1.4.5. Con: The information gained from torture techniques does not outweigh the harm caused.
1.4.5.1. Pro: The use of torture can radicalise others leading to further instability and risk to human life.
1.4.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.1.
1.4.5.1.2. Pro: Torture reinforces resistance through strong emotional appeal and can be used to aid recruitment for a violent opposition cause.
1.4.5.1.2.1. Pro: The torture practiced in Guantanamo Bay has been used as a recruitment tool by [Al-Qaeda.](https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/5734-johnson-mora-schmidt-the-strategic-costs-of)
1.4.5.1.2.2. Con: Lots of things can and will be used as a recruitment tool, including simply not being what the enemy wants or even lies. That in and of itself isn't a reason to not do what a nation needs to do to protect itself and its people and deal with its enemies.
1.4.5.1.2.3. Pro: The threat of torture has long been seen as an encouragement for religious extremists - for Christian [martyrs](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/boundless/201702/martyrdom-worst-idea-ever) torture and death meant getting closer to God, and was therefore a completely counterproductive method of trying to stamp out the religion.
1.4.5.1.2.4. Pro: Torture invites [reciprocity](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/statement-national-security-intelligence-and-interrogation-professionals) - a nation that uses torture risks their citizens being subjected to the same treatment in other countries.
1.4.5.2. Pro: Since you don't know which specific information you need \(date, place, perpetrators\) in order to save lives and who knows it, you have to accept that in order to \(possibly\) save some lives you have to torture a high and unknown number of prisoners. Such systematic use of torture has indeed proven efficient in cruel dictatorships and implies the abolition of human rights and democratic standards. It also promotes the suffering of innocent people, as it was the case with [Guantanamo](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/mohamedou-ould-slahi-guantanamo-bay-most-tortured-man-freed-without-charge-a7371666.html)\(+[here](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/most-guantanamo-detainees-are-innocent-ex-bush-official-1.804550)\).
1.4.5.3. Pro: Example of French Algeria war: this article [historynewsnetwork.org](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/5458)  shows that if torture helped to get tactical victories, such as the Battle of Algiers it was not really necessary to win that battle \(testimony by General Massu\). Moreover, the use of torture by the French polarized the population against them and in favor of the rebels and led the army to lose the war in long-term.
1.4.5.4. Con: That depends entirely on the outcome. The act of torture is worth roughly -3 lives. It will probably ruin the life of the torturer, the torturee, and the officer who orders the torturing. Thus, if the information gained saves more than three lives, the act is net positive.
1.4.5.4.1. Con: This is not a valid calculation as the effect on people's lives isn't the same for everyone involved. It is especially impossible to equate a life saved when the alternative outcome was death with a life affected by having done your job and having ordered the act of torture to be performed.
1.4.5.4.2. Con: The emotional strain felt by the person who ordered the torture is not comparable to the psychological and physical damage done to the person physically tortured.
1.4.5.4.3. Pro: The exact math and circumstances may be up for debate. However, the simplified example illustrates potential scenarios where torture may be justified, e.g. sacrificing the few for the many.
1.4.5.4.4. Con: Human lives or deaths should not be measured in numbers.
1.4.5.4.4.1. Con: Sometimes it is necessary to measure human lives in numbers; for example, in the case of risk assessment for an operation, the fatality rate must be measured against those it would save.
1.4.5.4.5. Con: This number can be scaled if the three persons torture many people over a long career.
1.4.5.4.6. Con: This assumes that the torture victim has the information.
1.4.6. Pro: The knowledge that torture is acceptable and may be applied is in and of itself a strong incentive for prisoners to cooperate with their captors.
1.4.6.1. Con: Cooperation is not the same as effective acquisition of truth. A prisoner may want to just comply with what the authorities want to hear, regardless of accuracy, to avoid torture.
1.4.6.2. Con: The death penalty has proven to be an [ineffective deterrent](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7323&context=jclc). To suggest that physical harm is a deterrent when death has proven to be an ineffective deterrent flies in the face of provable facts.
1.4.6.2.1. Con: Some people may be more afraid of physical pain than of being dead, which they perceive to be a painless state.
1.4.7. Con: The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence [produced a report](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/08/world/does-torture-work-the-cias-claims-and-what-the-committee-found.html) showing that C.I.A. failed to provide sufficient support for its torture tactics saving lives, and that in most cases cited by the C.I.A. as successes torture was not necessary or wasn't the reason for success.
1.4.7.1. Con: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.
1.4.7.2. Pro: The US Senate [Report](http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/study2014/sscistudy1.pdf) on "enhanced interrogation techniques" \(aka torture\) [shows](https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/29/us/cia-torture-report-fast-facts/index.html) that torture is "not an effective means of obtaining accurate information or gaining detainee cooperation."
1.4.7.2.1. Pro: The book [500 Days](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/books/review/500-days-by-kurt-eichenwald.html) by Kurt Eichenwald goes into some detail about the ineffectiveness of torture as a tool \(prisoners will tell you what you want to hear\) and the Bush administration’s dependence upon the opinion of a highly paid consultant with little experience in the field to justify their efforts. At the same time, the FBI’s tried-and-true technique of building trust with the accused was yet again proved more effective.
1.4.7.3. Con: We do not know if prisoners have information that could possibly save lives until attempts are made to extract it. Agents of the state have an obligation to pursue that information even if it is unlikely to produce results.
1.4.7.3.1. Con: It's a circular argument. The parent claim established that we do know with a statistical measure of accuracy that in most of the occasions it will not produce results.
1.4.7.3.2. Con: Taken to its extreme, this notion that "we don't know if they have information until we try and we must try no matter how unlikely the attempt is to produce results" means that by rights we should all be tortured on a regular basis, as any one of us might know something that could save lives, even if it is unlikely to actually do so.
1.4.7.3.3. Pro: Tortured prisoners are in a state of war against the state. In war, states regularly pursue courses of action which are unlikely to result in victory but do contribute to the war effort. For instance, the aerial bombing of enemy locations even at the risk of the loss of civilian life.
1.4.7.4. Con: Just because information could have conceivably been learned elsewhere does not mean that torture should not be considered. When deciding whether or not to use torture, agents of the state have no idea if that information is available elsewhere or how long it would take to get that information.
1.4.7.4.1. Con: It's a circular argument. As the information can be learned elsewhere, torture should not be considered on the premise that it should be the last resort. If the agents have no idea where the information is and how to get it, they also have no idea if a tortured person has this information.
1.4.8. Pro: Having the widest range of tools available to authorities keeps society safer.
1.4.8.1. Pro: The prospect of limiting collateral damage in wars outweighs a desire not to torture an individual, making it sometimes the only moral decision.
1.4.8.2. Pro: If these are high profile prisoners with knowledge that could affect lots of people, [MRI](https://www.aetv.com/real-crime/forget-polygraphs-brain-scan-lie-detectors-are-coming) could be used. Preliminary results show 75% accuracy in detecting lies.
1.4.8.3. Con: By this standard, police should have the right to seize private property such as automobiles or firearms to "keep society safer". Permitting authorities wide-ranging tools without reasonable checks on power creates an incentive for abuse.
1.4.8.4. Con: More power provided to authority usually results in the erosion of citizens' rights.
1.4.9. Con: Torture is ineffective at getting prisoners to reveal desired information.
1.4.9.1. Pro: People being tortured are focused on stopping the pain, and thus would be willing to say anything, leading them to say [false information](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-rsquo-ve-known-for-400-years-that-torture-doesn-rsquo-t-work/).
1.4.9.1.1. Pro: The tortured person can confess a crime he never committed, just to avoid suffering. Historical proof was people confessing to be actual witches/wizards during the XVII century European Inquisition.
1.4.9.1.2. Pro: Acting on false information causes law enforcement to waste valuable time and resources.
1.4.9.1.3. Con: When a person is in an extreme state of pain and distress it is not likely that they would have the capacity to come up with elaborate lies.
1.4.9.1.3.1. Con: Complex information is unlikely to be revealed during the actual subjection to pain. It is far more likely that the person "breaks", the torture pauses and the person reveals the details only when able to do so unimpeded by strong pain.
1.4.9.1.3.1.1. Con: Once the pain is gone, the prisoner might forget just how unbearable the pain was and change their mind about revealing the information.
1.4.9.1.3.1.1.1. Con: This seems implausible; [most forms of physical torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_methods_of_torture) will leave injuries that need recovery time, certainly not something easily forgotten.
1.4.9.1.3.1.1.2. Con: In which case, pain can be quickly and easily reapplied.
1.4.9.1.3.1.1.3. Pro: Human brains tend to muddle memories of extreme pain or stress.
1.4.9.1.3.1.1.3.1. Pro: There is [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19076128) that the memory of the pain of childbirth dulls over time.
1.4.9.1.3.1.1.3.2. Pro: Survivors of trauma, such as combat or rape, often have incomplete or fragmented memories of the event due to the way that [chemicals surge in the brain](http://time.com/3625414/rape-trauma-brain-memory/) during life-threatening situations.
1.4.9.1.3.2. Con: Often the information interrogators are seeking isn't very elaborate, and is usually things like names of others in the organisations, times of future attacks and their locations. Fabricating a date and naming a city does not require immense thought.
1.4.9.1.3.3. Con: A person need not compose the lie while being tortured. The torture victim might think of a lie in advance, or agree to talk to stop the torture and concoct the lie after the torture stops but before they really begin to speak.
1.4.9.1.4. Con: In cases where the information the suspect gives can be easily verified torture may still be practical. For example, using torture to force someone to reveal a password may be practical, because if they lie you can instantly check and know they lied.
1.4.9.1.4.1. Con: Attempts to verify may put agents in danger, such as using an incorrect password which may tip them off to the agent's identity.
1.4.9.1.4.2. Pro: If torture is restricted to such information as can be easily verified, there may be a valid place for it as an interrogation technique.
1.4.9.1.4.2.1. Con: This just creates a time-sucking cycle of lies, verification, and torture.
1.4.9.1.4.2.1.1. Pro: This happened to many of the Al-Qaeda prisoners tortured by CIA.  They lied to stop the pain, American forces investigated the “confession,” learned that they were false, and resumed torture.  Eventually, they gave up.  This was affirmed with the [publication](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/12/09/waterboarding-ksm/20151103/) of the Senate Intelligence Committee's summary of their findings of the effectiveness of CIA's torture program.
1.4.9.1.5. Pro: Experimental evidence suggests that moderate forms of torture such as sleep deprivation have deleterious effects on the reliability of information, for example making subjects vulnerable to suggestibility \([Blagrove, 1996\)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Blagrove/publication/232508886_Effects_of_Length_of_Sleep_Deprivation_on_Interrogative_Suggestibility/links/56e2c0ea08aeb97cabf8fb7c.pdf), and leading to the development of false memories \([Diekelmann et al., 2008](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003512)\).
1.4.9.1.6. Con: If torture is so bad, then prisoners will want to prevent it occurring to them again. It will become clear to agents of the state if the information provided to them is false. Therefore they are motivated to tell the truth to avoid future torture.
1.4.9.1.6.1. Con: As torture has often been used [without clear purpose](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/abu-ghraib-legacy-torture-war-terror-170928154012053.html), prisoners have no reason to believe telling the truth, even if they have it, will end the torture.
1.4.9.1.6.2. Con: This may also motivate them to just tell a different lie.
1.4.9.1.6.3. Con: It is impossible to know if prisoners actually know the information that they are being tortured for.
1.4.9.1.6.3.1. Con: In some cases your proof that they are guilty is also proof that they know information. E.g. if you are so certain that a prisoner committed a murder that you gave them life imprisonment, you would also be certain that they knew where the body was buried.
1.4.9.1.6.3.1.1. Con: Torturing a prisoner to reveal a position of a dead body is an immoral precedent. There are absolutely no reasons to involve torture in this scenario, unless for immoral or unethical reasons.
1.4.9.1.6.3.2. Pro: Prisoners held in custody are not necessarily the right people. They may not have the information or access to the information which agents of the state believe them to have.
1.4.9.1.6.3.2.1. Pro: [Abu Zubayday](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-cia-waterboarded-the-wrong-man-83-times-in-1-month/) was tortured 83 times in one month by the CIA for information related to Al-Qaeda, an organisation with which he was not associated.
1.4.9.1.6.3.2.2. Con: This is an argument for being more rigorous and selective in deciding when to use torture as an interrogation tool, not for never using it. However, in the instances where authorities are certain that the person they are torturing has the information they need, they should do so.
1.4.9.1.6.3.2.3. Pro: If not at war with a defined enemy it is difficult to determine who the enemy truly is. Because of our oft engagements in guerrilla or irregular warfare, it is difficult to find the enemy as they blend in well. It would be reprehensible to torture an innocent or the wrong person.
1.4.9.1.6.3.2.4. Pro: A [2004 report](http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf) by the Red Cross found that between 70-90% of the prisoners detained by coalition forces in Iraq were estimated to have been arrested by mistake, meaning that many of the prisoners tortured in Abu Ghraib were likely innocent.
1.4.9.1.6.3.2.5. Pro: Often, the fact that information is time sensitive is used to justify the use of torture. However, this makes it additionally unlikely that the right person is being tortured. This is because there is no time for the due process that establishes a prisoner's guilt or involvement with dangerous activities. As a result, prisoners who are neither guilty nor have any useful information may face torture.
1.4.9.1.6.3.2.5.1. Con: Torture, as an interrogation tool, is a harm exempt from due process: it is preemptive, not based on past offences so much as what is yet to come.
1.4.9.1.6.3.2.5.2. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.2.
1.4.9.1.6.3.2.5.3. Con: This is a description of a movie scenario. Urgency like that rarely happens in real life. In reality people are tortured when something already happened, not before. [www.e-ir.info](http://www.e-ir.info/2012/07/05/the-ticking-bomb-and-the-justification-of-torture/) [link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13164-014-0199-y) [www.ohchr.org](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Torture/A_HRC_37_50_EN.pdf)
1.4.9.1.6.3.3. Pro: Torture is aimed at making people talk, rather than specifically reveal true information. There is no mechanism for ensuring those tortured are incentivised to reveal the truth, rendering torture pointless.
1.4.9.1.6.3.3.1. Con: Information can be verified and torture applied if information turns out to be incorrect.
1.4.9.1.6.3.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.9.1.4.2.1.
1.4.9.1.6.3.3.1.2. Con: If the information is false it may be extremely difficult or costly to verify, as the "leads" it provides are immaterial.
1.4.9.1.6.3.3.1.3. Con: If the target simply doesn't know, they will also make unverifiable claims. Information control is a facet of guerilla warfare and clandestine operation.
1.4.9.1.7. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.1.6.3.3.
1.4.9.2. Pro: The concept of torturing someone for information presupposes the one\(s\) using torture believe the person\(s\) to be tortured actually possess the desired information. If the person\(s\) does in fact not posses the knowledge, he or she cannot be tortured until they provide said knowledge, opening the door for increased time and methods of torture.
1.4.9.3. Pro: A group of former interrogators and intelligence professionals [consider torture](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/statement-national-security-intelligence-and-interrogation-professionals) to be "illegal, ineffective, counterproductive and immoral".
1.4.9.3.1. Con: In counter-interrogation intelligence training, the rules are to resist until you can't, then give up a little and mislead until you can get the torture to stop by convincing the torturers to believe you. This implies that torture is inherently unreliable.

Source: Trainee from USAF torture training experts, Fairchild AFB, WA.
1.4.9.4. Pro: [Some studies](https://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-amp-space/article/2009-09/new-study-finds-torture-negatively-affects-memory) suggest that torture impairs recall of factual detail, being entirely counterproductive to its stated aim.
1.4.9.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.1.5.
1.4.9.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.2.1.
1.4.9.6. Pro: As torture does not work, it makes sense to concentrate on developing more sophisticated neuroscience technology, such as lie detectors and precision brain scans.
1.4.9.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.8.2.
1.4.9.6.2. Con: Lie detectors such as polygraph tests have already been invented and have been [debunked](http://www.apa.org/research/action/polygraph.aspx) as a reliable means of gathering information.
1.4.9.6.2.1. Con: More effective detection devices could be developed in the future.
1.4.9.6.2.2. Pro: Such tests tend only to be a measure of anxiety levels, which do not necessarily imply deception.
1.4.9.6.3. Con: In the case of precision brain scans, correlating observed patterns in activation to actual high-level behaviours will be \(for a good while\) just as unreliable as lie detectors, not to mention prohibitively expensive to use on a case-by-case basis.
1.4.9.7. Pro: The statistics reveal that torture is [ineffective.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/slightly-blighty/201701/does-torture-work)
1.4.9.7.1. Pro: Since it has been shown that torture is ineffective, it shouldn't be used unless as a method of punishment.
1.4.9.7.1.1. Pro: Prisoners up for interrogation are typically there because they have already harmed others; therefore [reciprocal justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_for_an_eye) is acceptable.
1.4.9.7.1.1.1. Pro: Reciprocal justice, when applied to the best of a state's ability and with the best possible oversight, is the best form of justice for promoting the interests of victims. Other forms of justice focus on promoting social harmony or individual rights, but do not clearly prioritize the interests of victims.
1.4.9.7.1.1.1.1. Con: This claim stands on the assumption that those tortured are justly imprisoned and there are victims, which is largely not the case in the case of torture that is mostly used for migrant prisoners. [www.ohchr.org](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Torture/A_HRC_37_50_EN.pdf)
1.4.9.7.1.1.2. Con: -> See 1.4.9.1.6.3.2.5.1.
1.4.9.7.1.1.3. Con: Justice in the form of "an eye for an eye" is an archaic justification for removing people's intrinsic human dignity.
1.4.9.7.1.1.3.1. Con: Criminals do not have or deserve dignity once they have committed a crime.
1.4.9.7.1.1.4. Con: -> See 1.4.9.1.6.3.2.4.
1.4.9.7.1.1.5. Con: Reciprocal justice seems to be synonymous with vengeance; and to quote a biblical passage, "Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord." Thus, engaging in reciprocal justice is against the teachings of the Bible, falling within the domain of God, and not humans.
1.4.9.7.1.1.5.1. Con: This would only apply for nations that adhere to religious law at the government level and thus base their decisions on the word of the Bible. For every other nation, this point is null and void as religious texts do not factor into their policy decisions.
1.4.9.7.1.1.6. Con: Reciprocal justice is acceptable when the punishments are transparent, proportional and consistent. Torture victims are tortured for an arbitrary amount of time, in circumstances which are confusing and distressing for them. That is not an acceptable version of justice.
1.4.9.7.1.1.7. Pro: Torture as a punitive measure can be limited in application to those people known to have committed serious crimes.
1.4.9.7.1.2. Con: -> See discussion #2903: The primary focus of prisons should be rehabilitation and reintegration, not punishment.
1.4.9.7.1.3. Con: It is hypocritical to punish violence with further violence.
1.4.9.7.1.3.1. Pro: To tell someone that hurting other people or the country is bad by hurting them will not teach them their mistake. It will just make them more hateful of the system.
1.4.9.7.1.3.2. Pro: Allowing someone to torture another human being would make the person committing the torture just as guilty as the person they are committing the act against. This perpetuates a cycle of abuse, and provides acceptance of the act the prisoner is found guilty of while simultaneously admitting the act of torture is reprehensible behavior.
1.4.9.8. Pro: Any information gained from torture is [fundamentally untrustworthy](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22830471-200-torture-doesnt-work-says-science-why-are-we-still-doing-it/) due to the methods of extraction.  Therefore there is no actual benefit to this practice.
1.4.9.9. Con: The use of torture is what induced Guy Fawkes to betray his co-conspirators after the failed [Gunpowder Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes#Torture) of November 5th 1605.
1.4.9.9.1. Con: A one-time event that happened more than 400 years ago is irrelevant to the contemporary situation.
1.4.9.9.1.1. Con: Human nature has not changed in the past 400 years.
1.4.9.9.1.1.1. Con: We have literally no idea what human nature was like in 1618, and thus no basis to make this claim.
1.4.9.9.1.1.2. Con: The human brain has evolved over the last 400 years. There is no reason to assume that, even granting "human nature" as a thing that exists, it hasn't evolved in concert with the human brain.
1.4.9.9.1.1.3. Con: There is no evidence that there is a fixed, immutable, universal human nature.
1.4.9.9.1.1.3.1. Pro: Human's personalities, values, and decision making are a combination of genetics and socialization. It seems incredibly reasonable to say a person's "nature" is influenced by their culture, upbringing, and experiences.
1.4.9.9.1.1.4. Con: Some humans compulsively seek out stimuli, others are monks. Some humans have deeply rooted self-preservation instincts, others commit suicide. The notion that there is a universal "human nature" either requires a definition so vague as to be meaningless, or is false.
1.4.9.9.1.1.5. Con: The fact that one person succumbed to torture, no matter how long ago, is not proof of torture working writ large.
1.4.9.10. Con: In Roman times, the testimony of slaves was sometimes [only admissible in court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome#cite_note-EB1911-2) if the slave had been tortured. This demonstrates that torture can be effective at extracting the truth in many instances.
1.4.9.10.1. Con: This might also be because they *believed* torture to be effective, and also didn't terribly care about their slave's dignity.
1.4.9.10.2. Con: True, though it may well have been because the psychological fear of pain and the natural human urge to preserve him or herself would push the prisoner to crack.
1.4.9.10.3. Con: In Roman times a lot of things were considered as viable ways to get the truth. More recently, in the Salem witch trials, absurd tests for witchery were used. "Dunk her under water, and if she doesn't drown, then she is a witch."
1.4.9.10.4. Con: Just because the Romans insisted on torturing their slaves does not lead to the conclusion that torture was effective.
1.4.9.11. Pro: If it worked, once would have been enough. The CIA used waterboarding "at least 83 times during August 2002" in the interrogation of Zubaydah. IG Report at 90, and 183 times during March 2003 in the interrogation of KSM. [theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/202940/)
1.4.9.11.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.1.6.3.2.1.
1.4.9.11.2. Con: The repetition of the act is part of the process. Most people won't talk after the first slap, but when faced with the prospect of endless slapping, they might reconsider their position.
1.4.9.12. Con: Claims that torture doesn't work are based on straw man scenarios where a lone prisoner is tortured. Ideally, torture would be employed where prisoners' answers could be checked and collated with the answers of other prisoners.
1.4.9.13. Con: Torture is simply the compressed, physical form of the sucker's payoff in the prisoner's dilemma, which is of well established value in interrogations.[Strategy for the Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma#Strategy_for_the_prisoner's_dilemma)
1.4.9.14. Pro: Usually torture "works best" on innocent average persons, while criminal elements typically have higher endurance against it and possibly some organized background that only gives them only the necessary minimum of information, expecting that the person will eventually face physical torture.
1.4.10. Pro: The fact that agencies such as the CIA chose to use torture despite being aware of the criticisms surrounding it indicates that it is effective. If the people who are most familiar with the technique and its outcomes approve of it, we should trust them.
1.4.10.1. Con: -> See 1.4.5.3.
1.4.10.2. Pro: Multiple CIA directors have [publicly stated](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cia-interrogations-saved-lives-1418142644) that the use of enhanced interrogation techniques saved thousands of lives.
1.4.10.2.1. Con: It is in the CIA's interest to make sure their doctrine is accepted so they can continue with their system. If we want to change, we must trust the statistics that be critical of what would be in the interest of CIA Directors to become true. This is due to pride, reputation, lack of humility, idealism and many other human detriments.
1.4.10.3. Pro: The use of torture attracts political and moral criticism. In light of this, agencies would not use it if they thought it was ineffective.
1.4.10.3.1. Con: That's a matter of balance: if they thought the outcome was more important than the harm coming from critics they would consider it a positive saldo and therefore continue.
1.4.10.3.2. Con: Reversing their stance on torture opens the CIA up to intense criticism and moral outrage for the [dozens of instances](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/29/us/cia-torture-report-fast-facts/index.html) they have used torture in the past.
1.4.10.3.3. Con: That, or they bury any suggestions of previous torture through proxies or lies. Criticism is easy to dodge if nobody knows there is something to be criticised.
1.4.10.3.3.1. Pro: Many governments throughout history have been caught \(or themselves later admitted\) attempting to cover up the use of torture.
1.4.10.3.3.1.1. Pro: The UK government deliberately misled the European Court of Human Rights so as to cover up that torture was used against the so-called ["Hooded Men"](http://www.rwuk.org/uk-government-continues-to-cover-up-torture-in-northern-ireland/) in Northern Ireland during the 1970s.
1.4.10.3.3.2. Pro: Even using the phrase 'enhanced interrogation techniques' is a type of evasion: realistically speaking, it is torture, but attempts to masquerade under another title.
1.4.10.4. Con: People who have engaged in the morally deplorable action of torture have a psychological incentive to delude themselves as to its effectiveness so they can live with their actions.
1.4.10.4.1. Pro: -> See 1.2.1.
1.4.10.4.2. Pro: People who approve of torture \(i.e. the CIA\) are [more likely](https://harvardmagazine.com/2010/03/power-of-torture) to see the pain a person goes through during torture as a sign of guilt, in their attempts to justify its implementation.
1.4.10.4.3. Pro: The process of finding justification for your behaviors and your beliefs is a proven psychological event called resolution of a cognitive dissonance. [\(Festinger, 1957\)](https://books.google.nl/books?hl=en&lr=&id=voeQ-8CASacC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=festinger%27s+1957+cognitive+dissonance+theory&ots=9y59Tzsfxy&sig=vgPu5u94GxWoT_2Pd7wZi8LT-rA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=festinger's%201957%20cognitive%20dissonance%20theory&f=false)
1.4.10.5. Con: The CIA has shown to make bad decisions, so their continued use of torture is not evidence of it being effective, rather it might just be a bad decision.
1.4.10.6. Con: Even if internally believing that the choice to engage in torture tactics was a wrong one, externally the organisation may be incentivised to defend the position it no longer holds to maintain a picture of someone who knows what they are doing.
1.4.10.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.10.3.2.
1.4.11. Con: There is no evidence that governments that use torture more often save more lives. However, there is evidence that people live longer in countries that don't use torture. For example, take Scandinavian countries: they respect [human rights](https://ourworldindata.org/human-rights) and have a low [violent death rate](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Latin-America-and-Africa-so-violent) and high [life expectancy](http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/life_tables/situation_trends/en/).
1.4.12. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.9.
1.4.13. Con: -> See 1.4.9.1.6.3.
1.5. Con: The sanctioning of torture has deleterious effects on a country's government and culture.
1.5.1. Pro: Conducting torture can be a false way of giving the citizens the feeling that criminals suffer for their felonies. The feeling of revenge is not something healthy we should pursue.
1.5.2. Pro: The application of torture sends the wrong message about those resorting to it.
1.5.2.1. Pro: The use of torture is regarded as abhorrent by many members of the public.
1.5.2.1.1. Pro: Less than [half](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/09/global-opinion-use-of-torture/) of people in Latin America, Europe, Asia/Pacific and the Middle East support the use of torture to extract information about possible attacks.
1.5.2.1.1.1. Con: -> See 1.4.4.2.
1.5.2.1.2. Pro: In light of its unpopularity, the use of torture by state agencies may erode public support for all their activities, not just those where torture is employed. This may result in budget cuts and obtrusive oversight, which may hinder their ability to do important work.
1.5.2.1.2.1. Pro: Though limited action was taken, controversy surrounding the [CIA's](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/11/cia-intelligence-committee-senate-crisis) use of torture hurt the agency's relationship with the Senate.
1.5.2.1.2.2. Pro: The use of torture in Guantanamo Bay has been pointed to as a reason to [shut down](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/01/usa-after-16-years-close-guantanamos-detention-center-once-and-for-all/) its detention centre. However, its existence has other strategic benefits such as the detention of individuals whose imprisonment elsewhere may be illegal or dangerous.
1.5.2.1.3. Con: -> See 1.4.4.
1.5.2.2. Con: The use of torture can strengthen a nation's reputation by reinforcing their indomitability and their backbone. A nation that is willing to resort to any means necessary in order to achieve their goals is one that others dare not cross.
1.5.2.2.1. Con: Any actor with prisoners in their possession is capable of torturing people. It exhibits no particular strength to torture a prisoner, in fact the opposite. States that resort to torture despite their expressed values may be perceived as desperate and weak.
1.5.2.2.1.1. Con: [The US, Russia, and China](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/01/24/the-eight-great-powers-of-2017/) are three of the world's greatest modern superpowers and they all practice various [methods](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/23/lawyer-torture-china-secret-jails-xie-yang) [of](https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/anastasia-zotova/stop-torture-in-russian-prisons) [torture.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/torture-guantanamo-bay-detention-centre-9-11-conspirator-un-human-rights-investigation-pentagon-a8109231.html) Moral high grounds are not necessary for diplomacy.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1. Con: Having a strong position in international diplomacy due to being a military superpower is not the same as being respected internationally as a diplomatic intermediary.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1.1. Pro: Sweden is an example of a country that [overachieves](http://foreignpolicy.com/2009/04/21/over-achievers-and-under-achievers/) [in](https://www.thelocal.se/20130220/46288) international diplomacy, and does so not through its military power.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1.2. Con: Regardless of whether the strong position is acquired by moral or military means, the result is usually the same desirable outcome: being listened to on the international stage.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1.2.1. Pro: The end [justifies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) the means.
1.5.2.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con: The morality of the means employed [outweigh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics) the outcome.
1.5.2.2.1.1.2. Con: We cannot confuse correlation with causation - the fact that certain countries that use torture are more powerful than others does not mean their power is due to their use of torture.
1.5.2.3. Pro: It is harder for liberal states to criticise the unjustified or excessive use of torture in other states if they have used it themselves in the past.
1.5.2.3.1. Pro: The United States of America has been condemned by [international media](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2014-12/11/content_19063242.htm) for their hypocrisy regarding torture.
1.5.2.4. Pro: The use of torture can be perceived negatively by international allies and partners who do not engage in similar practices, leading to division and alienation.
1.5.2.4.1. Pro: A [report on torture](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/nov/28/un-condemns-sleep-deprivation-among-us-detainees) by the UN condemned some of the practices in the US such as the use of sleep deprivation.
1.5.2.4.2. Pro: States benefit from having the moral high ground in international diplomacy. Torture undermines that position.
1.5.2.4.2.1. Con: -> See 1.5.2.2.1.1.
1.5.2.4.2.2. Con: The 'moral high ground' is a fluid concept, which is not necessarily considered relevant or important at times of crisis or war.
1.5.2.5. Pro: -> See 1.4.5.1.2.
1.5.3. Pro: A just and reasonable state treats all persons subject to it with dignity. People will respect, uphold, and eagerly join such states.
1.5.3.1. Pro: Historically, dictatorships tend to rely on torture to fight their real or supposed enemies. On the other hand, the more a country is democratic, the closer it is to a full abandonment of torture and inhuman treatement. You could evaluate how authoritarian and tyrannic a regime is by looking at how strongly it tolerates and/or promotes torture.
1.5.3.1.1. Pro: For example, many "communist" dictatorships rely on massive fear and political police, torture being a cornerstone of that strategy \( [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism) \): a\) the Soviet Union, especially under Stalin \(NKVD/KGB\) [blog.oup.com](https://blog.oup.com/2018/01/stalin-torture-great-terror/) b\) North Korea \(massive torture [www.mirror.co.uk](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/north-korea-prisons-otto-warmier-10653494)\), c\) The People's Republic of China until today [www.theepochtimes.com](https://www.theepochtimes.com/report-focuses-on-extreme-torture-in-chinese-detention-centers_2171616.html) [www.amnesty.org](https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/china/report-china/)
1.5.3.1.2. Pro: Arab dictatorships that were/are criticized by the Western World for lack of democracy also rely on torture: Sadam Hussein's Iraq [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/dec/07/iraq.jonathansteele1) [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Saddam_Hussein%27s_Iraq), Hassan and Bashar al Assad's Syria [www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/07/saydnaya-prison-assad-slaugterhouse-amnesty-report-torture-mass-hangings) [www.independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/assad-prisons-women-syria-female-inmate-treatment-conditions-exclusive-life-jails-a7899776.html) , Khaddafi's Lybia [fanack.com](https://fanack.com/libya/human-rights/) and Egypt [carnegieendowment.org](http://carnegieendowment.org/sada/75714) These are just a few examples: [www.newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/how-dictators-maintain-their-grip-power-68533)
1.5.3.1.3. Pro: The example of nazi Germany is quite obvious too \(Gestapo\).
1.5.3.1.4. Pro: There is a strong correlation between a high respect for human rights \(which includes the avoiding of torture\) and a high level of democracy. This is especially visible with Scandinavian \(Nordic\) countries \(but also AU, NZ, CH\). Data: [HR protection and violation](https://ourworldindata.org/human-rights), [Human Rights Risk Index](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/human-rights-risk-index-2016-q4), [Democracy Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index) \(also [here](https://infographics.economist.com/2018/DemocracyIndex/)\)  Other strong indicators of a democratic society and culture \(or lack of it\), are [free press](https://rsf.org/en/ranking) and [corruption](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017). Besides, these coutries also have the highest [life satisfaction](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/life-satisfaction/).
1.5.3.1.5. Pro: Recent statistics show that the less a US-president is legitimate regarding democracy and the number of voters, the more he officially supports torture: G.W. Bush got [539,897 votes less](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/22/worlddispatch.martinkettle) than his opponent and [promoted torture](https://www.hrw.org/report/2011/07/12/getting-away-torture/bush-administration-and-mistreatment-detainees) with [Guantanamo](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/guantanamo-bay-why-was-it-set-up-what-are-the-controversies-and-why-is-obama-looking-to-close-the-a6891516.html) and [CIA secret prisons](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/world/cia-kept-bush-ill-informed-on-interrogation-tactics-torture-report-says.html) \(also [here](http://www.thetorturereport.org/)\). [Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/nov/11/clinton-won-more-votes-trump-won-the-election-and-its-not-the-first-time) got[2.8 million votes less](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-lost-popular-vote-hillary-clinton-us-election-president-history-a7470116.html) and showed support for torture through his [words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpj3pp10wD8), [nominations](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2018/04/trump-s-indulgence-ultra-hawks-and-torture-apologists-turning-us-rogue) \(including [Ms Gina Haspel](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/13/17113874/gina-haspel-torture-cia-pompeo-tillerson) at the CIA\), [Guantanamo](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/detention/trump-embraces-original-sin-guantanamo) decision, [policy towards children](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2018/jun/22/trump-family-separation-crisis-immigration-border) and [numerous steps](https://www.thenation.com/article/donald-trump-has-a-passionate-desire-to-bring-back-torture/) taken in this direction.
1.5.3.1.6. Pro: Government-sanctioned torture can be of two kinds: ad-hoc with no preparation \(which is much less likely to produce results\) or part of an official policy with procedures. The latter presupposes training and specialisation in the complex process of torture, involving expertise from trained practitioners and also doctors, psychologists and military personnel. A system like this is more likely to exist in a dictatorship than in a free democratic society.
1.5.3.1.6.1. Pro: There is no such thing as a democratic and free country where students in medicine and psychology follow university programs and professional trainings teaching them how to torture people.
1.5.3.1.6.2. Pro: In democracies, soldiers and special forces are trained to torture only in order to resist it, not to use it as an interrogation method on prisoners. Here is an example of a US testimony: [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqli9-8Fa50) Harsh dictatorships, however, have no problem with encouraging inhuman behaviour among their troops.
1.5.3.1.6.3. Con: The declassified [Kubark Counterintelligence Interrogation Manual](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB27/docs/doc01.pdf) \( 1963 Ed. \) is available online. It is the US gov't training manual for interrogation. "Coercive" interrogation includes things like waterboarding. Find out more at [nsarchive2.gwu.edu](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/index.htm)
1.5.3.1.7. Pro: Countries traditionally viewed as "democracies" also happen to torture "officially". However, when once they have ended such practices, they state that the orders and permissions that were given at the time were not legally legitimate and undermined democracy. Look at Germany in the 1930s-1940s and France in the Algeria war: both wrote new constitutions and nominated new military commanders after these major crises. \(The US-Guantanamo case is still unsettled.\)
1.5.3.2. Pro: To have a coherent respect for justice, we must never torture. One may murder a million babies and yet they deserve a stoic system of justice to condemn them honorably under the law. That's the best justice served. The instant we overreach for vengeance, or even to save others from harm, we've disrespected justice.
1.5.4. Pro: Torture is by definition an inhumane act.  Rationalizing and condoning torture based on some "cost-benefit analysis" is yet another example of mechanical ego-mind's denial of the sanctity of human life.  Ergo, even the mere contemplation of torture \(let alone the act itself\) is dehumanizing and cannot serve humanity's greater good.
1.5.4.1. Con: The refusal to torture one individual and save countless lives is yet another example of individual cowardice's denial of many other's rights to life. The desire to have unstained morals despite all the lives one could save otherwise is inhuman and cannot serve humanity's greater good.
1.5.4.2. Con: The definition of "inhumane" refers to a subjective vision of humanity. There exist situations where torturing/killing is beneficial for humanity as a whole. As an example, if humans never died, overpopulation issues would arise, implying suffering.
1.5.5. Con: This argument relies upon an arbitrary classification of human life and dignity as absolute, which while a useful narrative for civilized society, is nevertheless arbitrary. It is unclear why human suffering is inherently worse than animal suffering, yet modern society clearly permits animal suffering on a vast scale. Culture might already be sufficiently damaged by animal torture, that human torture would not make much of a difference.
1.5.5.1. Con: Claiming we already torture animals would imply we should stop torturing them, not begin torturing humans too, unless there is a reason to justify torturing animals as well, which is unlikely since the typical reason is for information we need.
1.5.5.2. Pro: People who regularly commit torture already exist in some number. It just so happens that most of the victims of this torture are non-human. Unless society progresses to a point where all torture is eliminated, occasionally torturing humans cannot damage us very much.
1.5.5.3. Con: In cultural development, human suffering is structurally different from animal suffering.
1.5.6. Con: Whether or not torture is allowed will have a negligible effect on society, since the sanctioning of other harmful acts like warfare have already done significant societal damage.
1.5.6.1. Con: Torture is worse than war. In warfare, one armed soldier is facing another armed soldier. In torture, an armed guard is facing a defenceless prisoner.
1.5.6.1.1. Con: Most contemporary wars do not occur between equally equipped and trained forces. The mismatch in power is not too different than that between a guard and a prisoner.
1.5.7. Pro: The acceptance and use of torture impacts a nation's consciousness, signalling that the use of violence is acceptable, which is then interpreted and translated at individual and collective levels throughout that nation.
1.5.8. Pro: Cultures that accept the error that the ends justify the means have removed themselves from the ethical grounding required to act as an ethical culture.
1.5.9. Pro: If torture was a morally and culturally acceptable tool, then countries would not be so ashamed about revelations that they've used it in the past. The fact that most countries are quick to disavow any past use of torture and reverse their policies on it indicates that torture is wrong.
1.5.9.1. Pro: -> See 1.5.3.1.7.
1.5.10. Con: If a punishment has been legally sanctioned, then [according to the UN](https://www.apt.ch/en/what-is-torture/) the pain and suffering arising from it is not considered torture.  Therefore the parent claim is a non sequitur.
1.6. Pro: Torture, conceptually, could act as an excellent deterrent; knowing torture is acceptable is likely to make individuals reconsider actions that leave them vulnerable to it.
1.6.1. Con: If torture were legal, it would discourage people from 'surrendering' out of fear of being tortured.
1.6.2. Con: It does act as an extreme deterrent to being captured, as can be seen by a British solider [taking his own life](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-38812873) rather than be captured by ISIS. This is hardly a desirable outcome.
1.6.3. Con: -> See 1.4.5.1.2.4.
1.6.4. Pro: With regards to torture as a deterrent: "Sometimes greater punishment than that required for ordinary offenders would be in order since disobedients who are serious in their moral conviction may not be deterred by standard punishments". \([p. 7](http://globalsecuritystudies.com/Carpino%20Terror-AG.pdf)\)
1.6.5. Pro: War should continue to be a brutal endeavour, making us loathe to ever engage in it again. Because of that, some level of harsh treatment of prisoners--without permanent damage--is at times necessary to collect information, as each combatant has different thresholds of discomfort and pain.
1.6.5.1. Con: But war isn’t an endeavour that has ceased, despite the well documented experiences of men who fought in both world wars, perception doesn’t become a deterrent for everyone. And at what point do we determine that it’s a ‘torturable’ offence?
1.6.5.2. Con: It's assumed that the people starting wars are the same that endure the horrible consequences. But even if the ultimate penalty \(torture/death\) would always be inflicted on warmongering leaders its very doubtful if wars would cease to exist.
1.6.5.3. Con: Loathing a concept doesn't specifically deter us from it. In this specific case, even if we dislike wars and know very well the physical and emotional damage they do, we still partake in them. If it did work as you're putting it, no one would be engaging in wars anywhere in the world.
1.6.5.4. Con: To some, war is glamourised and romanticised, and in this modern time, sanitised. The personal consequences and impact can readily be overlooked, so the concept of war as hell as a deterrent doesn't hold up. Ideology too often trumps rational thought.
1.6.6. Con: People caught up in sweeping rendition/torture programs \(like the USA's program\) would barely have interacted with terrorists, or would have no connection to any terrorist activity at all. In many cases, agents of such programs claim the wrong target. The concept of deterrence, in this case, only stands if one assumes that every prisoner is a terrorist to begin with; evidence supports the contrary.
1.6.6.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.1.6.3.2.4.
1.6.7. Con: The actions that leave people vulnerable to torture have to be clearly defined. Current laws are vague in relation to what actions are a suitable reason for torture. Any person may be vulnerable to torture in the [current state of legislation](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Torture/A_HRC_37_50_EN.pdf).
1.6.8. Con: There is very little verifiable evidence to state that anyone has been deterred from serious crimes by danger of torture in the future. For a 2014 study, see [mdpi.com](http://www.mdpi.com:8080/2075-471X/4/1/1/pdf)
1.6.8.1. Pro: The type of actions that torture seeks to prevent are very difficult to deter people from performing, as there is often a deeply [ingrained ideology](https://nypost.com/2016/10/31/ex-isis-jihadi-explains-brainwashing-it-kind-of-takes-control-of-you/) associated with them.
1.6.8.1.1. Pro: In fact it's assumable that the foresight of extreme punishment indicates that the act is worthy.
1.6.8.2. Pro: Arbitrary punishment [has been shown](https://undark.org/article/deterrence-punishments-dont-reduce-crime/) to have the opposite of a deterrent effect.
1.6.9. Con: Using torture as a deterrent tars our free, democratic society with the same brush as brutal tyrants like Mugabe, Pol Pot, and Kim Jong-Il.  Among many others, former CIA directors, and the European Center for the Prevention of Torture have repeatedly stated the inefficacy of this approach, the repudiation it earns our country on the world stage, and the undermining of our moral standing. By advocating torture, efficacy aside, you threaten our soldiers to suffer under the same knife as our foes.
1.6.10. Con: Torture is often viewed as horrible and evil. The enemies of the ones who use torture could maybe be more motivated to oppose or attack the nation that is torturing.
1.7. Con: A necessary condition for torture to be an acceptable interrogation tool is that the torture be ordered by a legitimate authority. The nature of such legitimacy is highly contestable.
1.7.1. Con: Just because past authorities have exhibited corruption and malpractice when it comes to torture doesn't mean that a more legitimate organization for deciding how and when to torture can't be created.
1.7.2. Pro: The only authority that could legitimately order torture as an interrogation technique would be a fully and authentically democratic government.
1.7.2.1. Con: While some governments are more democratic than others, none can be considered fully and authentically democratic governments.
1.7.2.2. Pro: The anarchic point of view holds that state, whether democratic or authoritarian, will always act on behalf of its own survival. Legitimacy is defined by the hands of the enforcer of state power.
1.7.2.3. Pro: The only thing that separates democratic from non-democratic government is the separation of powers and voting. None of those protect from mob rule. The only thing that prevents mob rule are clear constitutional human rights, like the right to not be tortured.
1.7.3. Pro: Torture is the violence of the state.
1.7.4. Pro: The Senate Intelligence Committee's [report on torture](https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/29/us/cia-torture-report-fast-facts/index.html) shows that the CIA lied about the interrogation techniques used: "The interrogations of CIA detainees were brutal and far worse than the CIA represented to policymakers and others." No government agency that lies about its use of torture can be considered a legitimate authority to oversee its use.
1.7.4.1. Pro: In the case of Gitmo. It was found that nearly all of the people handed over to the American government were [innocent](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/most-guantanamo-detainees-are-innocent-ex-bush-official-1.804550) because the vetting process was [lax](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/25/guantanamo-detainees-captured-pakistan-afghanistan). Their innocence wasn't able to be verified by psychologist, who were used at Gitmo [to do so](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10481880802297624) because guilt was assumed from the point of detention.
1.7.5. Pro: Even if we presume that torture works there is no reason whatsoever to provide any government with such powers.
1.7.6. Pro: Corruption by higher authorities for personal or business gain degrades the legitimacy behind the application of enhanced interrogation.
1.8. Con: It is morally wrong to harm a defenseless person.
1.8.1. Pro: Torture is disproportionately cruel towards innocents. An innocent person probably has no useful information to give up, and thus will suffer more from torture than a guilty person that has something to give up.
1.8.1.1. Pro: Soldiers are acting as pieces in a much larger chess game and as such are morally innocent in many if not most cases. To torture an innocent person cannot be considered acceptable.
1.8.1.2. Con: The disproportionately negative effect on innocents could be used against any given method of law enforcement - death penalty, life sentence, or any type of criminal conviction.
1.8.1.2.1. Con: This does not apply to every method of law enforcement. Where a method is applied until a person gives up information, there is a higher application on innocent people because they don’t have information to give up \(so they’ll be tortured longer\). Prison, the death penalty, etc. are not applied until people give up information and then stopped.
1.8.2. Con: Torture tends to be used as a last resort - prisoners generally have the opportunity to speak and potentially avoid getting tortured altogether.
1.8.2.1. Con: That said it looks okay that even this discussion about torture could be, in a last resort, solved by extreme physical violence. Because, as you say, we've al had the opportunity to speak out, but we can't come to a conclusion.
1.8.2.2. Con: This is not a fair choice at all for the prisoners who have a strong preference not to reveal the information the interrogators are seeking. Prisoners are likely to avoid giving it up voluntarily until torture actually starts. Therefore, torture is not being used as a last resort.
1.8.2.2.1. Con: The choices that the prisoner makes do not negate the fact that they could avoid the torture altogether if they simply reveal the desired information.
1.8.2.3. Con: Interrogators and prison guards could torture prisoners solely to fulfill their own sadistic desires or out of a motivation for personal revenge.
1.8.2.3.1. Pro: The psychology behind this is exemplified in the \(rather infamous\) [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment); human nature, when placed in an environment under pressure with clear status distinctions, can be a long way from friendly.
1.8.2.3.1.1. Con: -> See 1.3.5.1.2.
1.8.2.3.2. Con: The abuse of power is a constant feature in every layer and aspect of human society - it should not be a reason to discard otherwise potentially useful methods of law enforcement.
1.8.2.3.2.1. Con: Some situations are easier to abuse than others. In the case of torture it is very hard to draw the line between it being applied as intended, and the torturer fulfilling their sadistic desires.
1.8.2.3.3. Pro: Those who pursue careers which allow them to torture are more likely be the sort of person who enjoys it. This increases the risk of the use of excessive or unnecessary force.
1.8.2.3.4. Pro: The [Abu Ghraib scandal](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/abu-ghraib-legacy-torture-war-terror-170928154012053.html) revealed that US military personnel tortured and humiliated prisoners not for interrogation purposes, but as revenge for the 9/11 attacks.
1.8.2.4. Con: Assuming they even possess required information.
1.8.3. Pro: It is illegitimate for state actors to harm someone without due process.
1.8.3.1. Con: -> See 1.4.9.1.6.3.2.5.1.
1.8.3.2. Con: The unbelievable civilian casualty rates that are inevitable in warfare are not afforded this degree of consideration; better one tortured individual to a host of collateral injured or dead.
1.8.3.3. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.1.6.3.2.4.
1.8.3.4. Pro: The state's authority to use violence is based on clear, transparent principles of governance and justice. Torture is arbitrary and its use is obfuscated to the public. It is therefore an illegitimate use of force by the state.
1.8.3.4.1. Con: The state exists as the only [legitimate user of force.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/state-monopoly-on-violence) Therefore, if the state is in a position to use and approve of torture, the use of that force is within their remit.
1.8.3.4.1.1. Con: The state's authority to use that force is based on the expectation that it will be used fairly and justly on the basis of [democratic consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) and appropriate [checks and balances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers). The use of torture is incompatible with those considerations.
1.8.3.4.1.1.1. Pro: Torture is usually used by the institutions of the state least subject to oversight by their nature  - such as the [intelligence services](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/curt-goering/checks-and-balances-ensur_b_5831882.html) and secret police.
1.8.3.4.1.1.2. Con: It is not incompatible. Torture can be subject to checks and regulations if states are given the authorisation in the first place; while it remains illicit, proper monitoring cannot occur. As such, it makes more sense to permit it and regulate it, than to relegate it to secrecy.
1.8.3.4.1.2. Pro: Violence in a society can be rendered socially productive and a source of increased welfare, [if it is organised](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002200202236166?journalCode=jcrb). One example of such organisation is the [monopoly on violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_as_a_Vocation) given to the state. Torture of prisoners is just part of that monopoly, necessary for the welfare of our society.
1.8.3.4.2. Con: Not all elements of governance and justice can be transparent; there are elements that - for the sake of security and longterm public benefit - need to remain obfuscated. Interrogation techniques fall under this category.
1.8.4. Con: Philosophers have failed to find an undeniable set of moral truths over the centuries, and therefore it is impossible to determine if anything can be defined as truly "morally wrong."
1.8.4.1. Con: Every individual culture, even the most open and accommodating, has a set of rules of behavior that illustrates what it considers morally acceptable and morally repugnant.
1.8.4.1.1. Con: Subcultural norms conflict. A culture can't be said to have consistent views of morality.
1.8.4.2. Con: Philosophers derive conclusions through discussion. Philosophy was never intended as a tool to promote the necessity of harm to a human being.
1.8.4.2.1. Con: Philosophies of self-preservation promote the necessity of harming others.
1.8.4.3. Con: Though it hasn't been possible to identify absolute moral principles, it's possible to define preconditions for the birth and the preservation of the society, like the elimination of the inner violence or its being directed towards the outside of the society. With the extension of the socially accepted rights \(defining the "inside" in opposition to the social "outside"\) to almost anyone on the earth, the violence can't be but a violation of those preconditions or of the following extension.
1.8.4.4. Con: -> See discussion #2649: Morality is objective.
1.8.5. Con: -> See 1.4.9.7.1.1.
1.8.6. Con: It is morally wrong to not go to extreme measures i.e. torture to extract life saving information from a captured prisoner.
1.8.6.1. Pro: One's moral compunctions cannot override the necessity of torture; it is surely more morally sound to protect the lives and wellbeing of as many people as possible, which torture can permit.
1.8.6.1.1. Pro: Principles of righteousness lose some of their significance when their being upheld results in harms to others.
1.8.6.1.2. Con: Morality does not count heads. It is immoral to submit a person to torture whether this protects lives or not. This is a slippery slope, where the next person might as well be you, your family member, you friend. The "end justifies the means" logic is immoral and should not have a place in a contemporary society.
1.8.6.1.2.1. Con: It is selfish to value your own life and happiness over others'. If the next person has to be you, your family member, or your friend, it is moral to give that sacrifice.
1.8.6.1.2.2. Con: Moral philosophies like "Effective Altruism" do take into account numbers as a way to maximize impact. This particular argument centers around whether one should save one person or ten \[ re-statement of trolley problem \]. This comes down to a conflict between practicality and idealism.
1.8.6.1.3. Pro: The utilitarian \( Bentham, Mill \) concept of the "greatest good for the greatest number" might allow for this provided that the use of torture prevented or reduced harm to more than the number being tortured.
1.8.6.1.4. Con: If the protection of the wellbeing of the largest number of people is an acceptable reason to surrender moral principles, then a whole host of reprehensible actions - such as the abduction of individuals to harvest and redistribute their organs - should also be considered acceptable.
1.8.6.1.4.1. Con: That example was not the greatest well-being scenario. Organ harvesting occurs in a voluntarily manner, distributed across multiple individuals so that those individuals don't die. In a real greatest well-being scenario, people would have a sense that that was necessary and would not feel that the action was reprehensible.
1.8.6.2. Con: This argument is based on the philosophy of [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) and as such is often not accepted as the basis for ethical issues such as the use of torture.
1.8.6.2.1. Con: Philosophies are the sources of ethics. The used link itself calls utilitarianism an "ethical philosophy".
1.8.6.2.2. Con: Being associated with Utilitarianism does not disqualify the reasoning \([association fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy)\). This is about solving the trolley problem with the greatest number of people alive.
1.8.6.3. Con: -> See 1.8.6.1.2.
1.8.6.4. Con: -> See 1.5.4.
1.8.7. Pro: Torture in and of itself is an immoral action regardless of the crime committed by the perpetrator. [Torture also creates mental/physical/emotional problems for the recipient.](https://www.cvt.org/sites/default/files/downloads/CVT%20Effects%20Torture%20April%202015.pdf) From the broadness of this question it also could imply that even those who go to prison on less serious offenses would endure the same treatment as others.
1.8.8. Pro: Torture is morally unacceptable as anything that disregards dignity of a human being created in image of God.
1.8.8.1. Con: -> See 1.3.1.1.
1.8.9. Pro: Torture is immoral because nobody wants to be subject to this treatment if they were accused of a crime.
1.8.9.1. Con: Nobody wants to serve time in prison either, but certain punitive measures are necessary in a society in order to ensure safety and order.
1.8.9.2. Pro: If advocates of torture experienced it for themselves, then they would quickly realize how terrible it is and most likely stop supporting it.
1.8.10. Pro: -> See 1.5.9.
1.8.11. Pro: No one nor entity should be allowed to [harm another human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_of_person), except in self-defense, and torture of a prisoner is not self-defense.
1.8.11.1. Pro: Torture in any form is simply barbaric. If we wish to elevate from our animal condition we should exclude it.
1.8.11.1.1. Con: Things one might consider "barbaric" are often only different from what one is used to. Torture may not be pretty, but it saves lives.
1.8.11.2. Pro: They're still human, despite what they've done. If you use the excuse they hurt others you're no better than them if you hurt them back. There's other ways to get information out of someone.
1.8.11.3. Con: It is selfish to defend oneself and not defend others. A great number of innocent lives could be saved by extracting the information. Only one single guilty life would be harmed \(it wouldn't even be lost\) in extracting it.
1.9. Con: If torture is allowed, then it could easily be misused or performed in excess.
1.9.1. Con: This argument applies to any kind of punishment: for example, putting people in prison could easily be misused or performed in excess and therefore we shouldn't imprison people.
1.9.1.1. Con: There is a great line between separating an individual from society and physically harming the same individual. Torture is a much more traumatic and damaging experience than imprisonment.
1.9.2. Pro: -> See 1.8.2.3.
1.9.3. Con: If torture is condoned and accepted, it can be regulated: those with sufficient knowledge and understanding of torture can draw up internal rulings that document severity and track escalation.
1.9.3.1. Con: If torture is banned, then there will be no torture.
1.9.3.1.1. Con: Although 144 countries have ratified the Convention against Torture, a [2007 report](http://Amnesty International noted cases of state-sponsored torture or other inhumane treatment in 102 of the 153 countries included in its 2007 report) by Amnesty International noted cases of state-sponsored torture or other inhumane treatment in 102 of the 153 countries included.
1.9.3.1.1.1. Con: The argument implies that covert and completely illegal cases of torture somehow refute the validity of laws that are used in 144 countries around the world. What this argument really suggests is that the misuse of torture is overwhelming, that torture should be banned worldwide for good and that it should be consistently enforced without exceptions.
1.9.3.2. Pro: Regulation has been proven to make things generally safer, for example implementing licenses for driving automobiles.
1.9.3.3. Con: Those who have sufficient knowledge and understanding of torture are biased through their interest. They are not suitable to assess the necessary regulations. Documentation of severity and tracking escalation is not regulating the misuse as the issue of misuse is not in how it is performed, but whether there is legal ground to perform it, in the first place.
1.9.4. Con: The individuals who perform torture are trained in how to most effectively torture people in order to extract information. These people are unlikely to use torture is such a way that it becomes counterproductive to their goals, i.e. killing their subject.
1.9.4.1. Con: The fact that interrogators are trained does not mean that torture cannot be misused. The assumption that they are unlikely to do so is not a fact until proven.
1.9.5. Pro: It is difficult to know where the line should be drawn insofar as determining what forms of torture ought to be deemed acceptable.
1.9.5.1. Pro: Individuals have different pain tolerances and weaknesses, meaning that a level of torture that is wildly unpleasant to one person may be fatal to another.
1.9.5.1.1. Con: The point of torture is to gradually find the person-specific pain tolerance level at which they "crack", not to apply the same indiscriminate levels of pain to everyone.
1.9.5.1.2. Con: There is substantial research on the [variety of factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_tolerance) influencing pain tolerance. This knowledge could be used to better tailor the severity of torture to a specific individual's capacity to resist and survive it.
1.9.5.1.2.1. Con: Such research only provides information about the average expectations per population stratum. Individual variation within a subgroup is likely to be larger than between subgroups.
1.9.5.2. Pro: Drawing a line in such circumstances is difficult, if not impossible. As such, it is subject to bias and abuse by those who are attempting to define the limits.
1.9.5.2.1. Con: The possibility of bias and abuse is not a reason not to try to define the limits. If the possibility of bias was a reason not to do it than sciences would not exist.
1.9.5.3. Con: -> See 1.9.3.
1.9.5.4. Pro: If moderate physical torture such as sleep deprivation is allowed, then it creates a [slippery slope](https://www.economist.com/node/9832909) wherein more severe forms of torture could be introduced if the moderate methods are deemed ineffective.
1.9.5.4.1. Con: Torture can only provide some good if it is useful in getting information. If moderate methods don't facilitate this, it is legitimate to scale the torture to a higher level in order to obtain this information.
1.9.5.4.2. Pro: Torture may seem to have a sliding scale insofar as severity, but it is hard to know where the line is drawn between 'mild' and 'extreme'; there is no absolute standard. As such, the system can be easily abused. Therefore, either torture is banned outright, or it is not, and the repercussions of both decisions can and will be felt fully.
1.9.6. Con: Rogue actors will use ethically dubious techniques which are in a legal [grey area](http://www.jurist.org/hotline/2016/04/cristian-correa-waterboarding-illegal.php) such as waterboarding regardless of the legality of torture. It is better that when torture is employed as a technique it is done so in a clearly regulated and transparent manner.
1.9.6.1. Pro: Only by having "acceptable" and "unacceptable" measures of torture can we prevent the worst methods from being used in the international community.
1.9.6.2. Pro: -> See 1.9.5.4.2.
1.9.7. Pro: More often than not, torture is not about obtaining information but rather demonstrating power over a defenseless person. Sanctioning torture only opens a job market for psychopaths.
1.9.8. Pro: If we were to accept that for everyone, then political prisoners who are fighting for a cause will be tortured and disrespected as well, even if they did no physical harm to anyone, jeopardizing their lives for telling the truth and helping people access that knowledge.
1.9.9. Pro: Torture is highly reliant on skill and thus requires extensive [training](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/22/AR2006092201486.html) in order to be properly performed. As long as interrogators undergo this training, then it is far less likely that torture will be mis- or overused.
1.10. Pro: Some people have done such appalling things as to forfeit their right to human dignity.
1.10.1. Con: The term "appalling" is very subjective, which is why a criminal may or may not receive the death penalty for a crime depending on where it was committed, since different countries and states have different laws in place.
1.10.2. Pro: Society already accepts of some measures of human dignity being removed from people based on their actions, such as when [solitary confinement](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10968713/Solitary-confinement-inside-Americas-dreaded-isolation-cells.html) is used.
1.10.2.1. Con: There is broad objection to solitary confinement by activists, and such objections often take the form of arguing [that solitary confinement constitutes torture](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/solitary-confinement-is-torture-will-the-bureau-of-prisons-finally-stop-using-it/2017/07/15/f719de20-68c6-11e7-8eb5-cbccc2e7bfbf_story.html?utm_term=.6344fd05404d).
1.10.2.2. Con: Where in the U.S. solitary confinement is a punishment largely restricted to people who have been convicted of crimes by civilian courts, the subjects of torture have generally been people who haven't even received a military tribunal. As such, those who are tortured haven't even had their guilt ascertained.
1.10.2.3. Con: The fact that society accepted "some measures of human dignity being removed" does not imply that these decisions have positive effects on society or prisoners. Furthermore, this acceptance does not automatically transfer to physical torture.
1.10.3. Con: -> See 1.8.1.
1.10.4. Pro: Indeed, torture is potentially a far kinder fate than tortured individuals might have inflicted upon their respective victims: torture can leave an individual with little to no long-term damage, able to rebuild their lives. Victims may have lifelong injuries, be homeless, have lost family members; the list is endless.
1.10.4.1. Con: Torture has been shown to often leave [long-term psychological scars.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/torture-can-affect-brain-leaving-long-term-psychological-scars)
1.10.4.1.1. Pro: Most prisoners are going to be released sooner or later and become members of our society. A person who has been mentally and physically abused will not perform well in society.
1.10.4.2. Con: A prisoner can have information they do not wish to give up without necessarily being directly responsible for that sort of harm to victims.
1.10.4.3. Con: It is impossible to argue that torture is okay on the proviso that torture is a 'far kinder fate', or a 'greater good' has been established.
1.10.5. Con: Human dignity is an absolute, not a relative, right. If this is not held to be true then there is no point in having 'rights' in the first place.
1.10.5.1. Con: It is naive to insist that human dignity is absolute if/when a guilty person has clearly removed the dignity of their victim\(s\) through violent or other criminal acts. In order to protect people's rights, society must demonstrate that there are real consequences for those who violate others' rights.
1.10.5.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.7.1.1.
1.10.5.1.2. Con: There is never a reason to remove someone's rights; even if they violate someone else’s, the urge to do similar things to them as punishment is just bald revenge with only emotional reasoning behind it.
1.10.5.1.2.1. Con: Imprisoning a prisoner is also removing their rights, in this case their right to liberty. If it were never permissible to remove someone's rights then there would be basically no consequences to actions.
1.10.6. Pro: It should depend upon the crime and its severity.
1.10.6.1. Pro: Drug violators and robbery convicts would not receive the same type or amount as murderers, child abusers or capital criminals. Also, perhaps years can be removed from a sentence in exchange for the kind and amount of torture received.
1.10.6.1.1. Con: This would put far too much power in the hands of the state to determine the qualification for being tortured.
1.10.6.2. Pro: If the prisoner is unequivocally guilty of torture, torturing them for a related means to an end is just.
1.10.6.2.1. Con: -> See 1.4.9.7.1.3.2.
1.10.7. Con: It is important to have a line in the sand for what the state should be unable to do. Allowing torture is a very dangerous precedent.
1.10.7.1. Con: -> See 1.9.5.2.
1.10.8. Pro: If one is found guilty, it's perfectly legal to ensure that that individual receives the maximum penalty under the law.
1.10.9. Con: Many argue that no humans have free will, but their actions are decided by their experiences and environment; as such, they cannot be held accountable for the wrongs they do.
1.10.9.1. Con: The existence or non-existence of free will is irrelevant to the question of prisoner treatment. If we accept the idea of prisons, we accept that people can be incarcerated within them.
1.10.9.2. Pro: -> See discussion #5685: There is no free will.
1.10.10. Con: The person responsible for torturing someone would then be committing an act so appalling that they too would forfeit their right to human dignity. Therefore one must conclude that torture causes irreparable harm to those inflicting torture as well as the person on the receiving end.
1.11. Con: -> See 1.4.9.
1.12. Con: International law, as well as the domestic law in many countries, is against the use of torture.
1.12.1. Con: The law is not an indication of the absolute acceptability of something, given how laws differ from state to state and how they can be changed depending on the political climate of the time.
1.12.2. Con: -> See 1.9.3.1.1.
1.12.3. Pro: Confessions given under duress are not admissible in court.
1.12.3.1. Con: This assumes a recourse to formal legal proceedings; extracting a confession of crime is different to extracting workable information that can be used.
1.12.3.2. Con: The Chicago Police Department has a two decade long history of [police using torture](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/10000-files-on-chicago-police-torture-decades-now-online/504233/) to get confessions from innocent people who were then incarcerated.
1.12.4. Pro: A state consists of its people and its people demand rights. It's not an effective trade-off to allow the denial of rights to become a commonplace thing, which is why the use of torture is forbidden to states by law.
1.12.5. Con: States uphold international legal norms because they expect other states to do the same; however when dealing with enemies who are non-state actors there is no expectation of reciprocation or the protection of any prisoners they might take, therefore these norms no longer apply.
1.12.5.1. Pro: The Al-Qaeda [torture handbook](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/al-qaeda-manual-had-its-own-description-of-torture-techniques/) shows that Al-Qaeda can and do utilise extreme torture methods in their treatment of prisoners.
1.12.5.2. Con: Even when prisoners are not imprisoned due to actions associated with a state, many still have citizenship of a state. For instance, there are [nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_detainees_at_Guantanamo_Bay) Russian detainees in Guantanamo Bay.
1.12.5.2.1. Pro: Mistreatment in the form of torture of these non-state actors who technically have citizenship of a state only serves to raise tensions in the international community.
1.12.5.3. Con: States should uphold international law because it represents the collective will of the international community, to which they may be contractually bound through [treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions).
1.12.5.4. Con: -> See 1.5.2.4.2.
1.12.5.5. Con: -> See 1.5.2.4.
1.12.6. Pro: There are a variety of specific laws internationally that prohibit torture.
1.12.6.1. Pro: [Article 3](https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf) of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits the use of torture, and inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment.
1.12.6.2. Pro: The [International Bill of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bill_of_Human_Rights) consists of the [ICCPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights#Rights_to_physical_integrity) and [ICESCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights#Right_to_health), both of which grant freedom from torture as a Human Right.
This has been [signed by 170 states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ICCPR-members2.PNG).
1.12.6.2.1. Con: The US and courts of other countries [have said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights#cite_note-4) that the Declaration "does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law".
1.12.6.3. Pro: Torture is a cruel and unusual punishment that is banned by the 8th Amendment of the Constitution.
1.12.6.3.1. Con: Even a [Supreme Court Justice](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/12/antonin-scalias-case-for-torture/383730/) dismissed the relevance of the 8th Amendment to torture on the technicality of torture not being punishment.
1.12.6.3.1.1. Pro: -> See 1.4.9.1.6.3.2.5.1.
1.12.6.3.2. Con: The Constitution is a document which is hundreds of years old and its authors were not familiar with the unique difficulties faced by modern states in combating sophisticated international terror organisations.
1.12.6.3.2.1. Con: Until the legislative process amends or changes the Constitution, it is legally binding to uphold its principles, however outdated.
1.12.6.4. Pro: [Article 3](http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.32_GC-III-EN.pdf) of the Geneva Conventions prohibits the use of any torture, cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, or outrages against the human dignity of POWs.
1.12.6.4.1. Con: Article 3 only pertains to wartime; however, torture as an interrogation tactic can still be useful when utilized in non-wartime situations, such as in dealing with gang violence or transnational crime.
1.12.6.5. Pro: No human being should be tortured; there are penalties for someone who commits a crime, and if someone accused or suspected does not want to testify, this is in their right at least in most legislations.
1.12.7. Con: We should not base our opinions on whether something is acceptable by the law or not; we're discussing if we should, not if we can.
1.12.8. Pro: When one country breaks the law, it sets a precedent for others to do the same.
1.12.8.1. Pro: Much of [international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law) is consent-based - a state is not bound by this type of international law, unless it has expressly consented to a particular course of conduct. If states start to break this type of international law the consequences could be wide-ranging and could severely damage the integrity of the international legal system.
1.12.8.2. Con: A country that breaks binding international law is going to be reprimanded and/or punished by the appropriate courts, which can deter other countries from doing the same.
1.12.8.3. Pro: Accepting torture as an interrogation tool means throwing international human rights and morality overboard; by extension, it would also make it acceptable and permissible to whomever is perceived as the enemy as well.
1.12.9. Con: As authorities can only act within the constraints of law, new legislation needs to be enacted to address the issue of black-site prisons such as Guantanamo Bay, which currently present a judicial and jurisdictional quagmire and are often used as torture facilities.
1.12.10. Pro: Torturing of prisoners will involve the commission of offences which society has made illegal, thereby making the torturers and supporters of torture no better than the criminals that have been arrested. This will blur the lines between right and wrong and allow the torturers to lawfully commit crimes.
